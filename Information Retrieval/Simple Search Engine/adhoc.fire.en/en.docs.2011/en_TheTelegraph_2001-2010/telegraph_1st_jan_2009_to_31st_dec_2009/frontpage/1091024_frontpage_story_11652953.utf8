          MUZAFFAR RAINA                                              
	Srinagar, Oct. 23: From Indira Gandhi to Manmohan Singh, six Prime Ministers of India share a 26-year-old Kashmir connection that their successors seem destined to bear well past 2019 unless Mamata Banerjee gets cracking.        
	Accompanied by Mamata, Manmohan Singh will be in Kashmir next Wednesday to inaugurate an 18km stretch of steel track that, when completed, will connect Jammu with Kashmir through a full-length railway line for the first time.        
	If the sharp eye of the economist spots a beaten-track syndrome, he wont be far off the mark: it will be the Prime Ministers third visit to the state on a similar mission. Before Singh and Mamata, the same project has had the privilege of being midwifed by five Prime Ministers and five railway ministers. (See chart)        
	However, despite being blessed by such mighty hands and several thousands of crores of rupees, the Jammu-Baramullah line is only half-born even after a 26-year gap between conception and birth.        
	From 1983, a steady stream of VVIPs has arrived in Kashmir to mark milestones of the project ranging from multiple foundation stone-laying programmes to inauguration of piecemeal stretches of tracks  a quarter-century distinction that perhaps no other project in India has had to live down.         
	The deadline for the final stretch has been set at 2019, which looks difficult unless Mamata takes time off from her preoccupations in Bengal and fast-tracks the work.        
	This (rail connectivity) is one instance of how the Centre has made only promises for the development of our state and done little to implement them, said a leader from the Opposition Peoples Democratic Party. The only Prime Ministers since 1983 who have not visited the state in connection with the railway link are V.P. Singh, Chandra Shekhar and P.V. Narasimha Rao.        
	A rail link to Kashmir was first thought of in 1898 by the then Dogra rulers, but they could take it only till Jammu. But even this got de-linked from the countrys rail grid because of Partition and could only be re-connected in 1970 via Pathankot in Punjab.         
	In 1983, then Prime Minister Indira Gandhi was the first to lay a foundation stone after she announced a 54km railway line between Jammu and Udhampur, promising to complete it in five years and also extend it thereafter by 290km to Baramulla in the Kashmir Valley.         
	But there was no progress with Indira Gandhi getting caught up in the Punjab problem, leading to her assassination in October 1984.         
	In 1986, her son and successor Rajiv Gandhi performed the same ritual, like his mother, in Udhampur, again laying the foundation stone for the same stretch.         
	Again, that was the last that was heard of the project, until it was yanked out of the backburner by the Congress government nine years later.         
	This time, though, the Prime Minister of the day, Narasimha Rao, chose not to visit, but left it to his railway minister Suresh Kalmadi. Kalmadi laid a fresh foundation stone in 1995, again at Udhampur and for the same 54-km stretch.         
	Rao too played a role. In 1996, his final year at the helm, Rao sanctioned Rs 2,600 crore for the extension of the rail link from Udhampur to Baramulla, covering 290km, at a time when there was little progress on the Jammu-Udhampur stretch.        
	The Congress lost power that year, and it was H.D. Deve Gowda who, as Prime Minister in March 1997, was destined to perform the ritual of laying the foundation stone for the extension, again in Udhampur.         
	Gowda, however, lost his crown and two months later, Gujral, his successor, performed the same ceremony, only this time in Baramulla in the Valley.         
	For 19 years since Indira Gandhis visit, the link to Kashmir remained a mirage  with hardly any work on the ground  until Prime Minister Vajpayee declared it a national project, which meant resources would be made available at any cost.         
	Vajpayee visited the Valley in April 2003 to lay the foundation stone for the first railway bridge on the track.         
	Over the last four years, the foundation ceremonies have given way to inauguration of the project, in parts.         
	The first inauguration, by Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, was in 2005. This was the 54km Jammu-Udhampur stretch, which at last saw the light 22 years after work began. Initially budgeted at Rs 50 crore over five years, the cost had shot up to Rs 550 crore with a time overrun of 17 years.         
	When Vajpayee repackaged the construction of the remaining 290km Udhampur-Katra-Qazigund-Baramulla link in 2002 at a cost of Rs 6,800 crore, it was slated for inauguration in 2007.        
	You already have two high-profile inaugurations of small stretches of the track and the fact is that only a fourth of this project is complete, a government official said.         
	The remaining project was divided into three parts  Udhampur to Katra (41km), Katra to Qazigund (130) and Qazigund to Baramulla (119km), the last stretching across the plains from north to south Kashmir.         
	A 66km stretch from Anantnag to Mazhama, on the Qazigund-Baramulla section, was inaugurated by Singh in October last year. Early this year, UPA chairperson Sonia Gandhi did the honours of inaugurating the 35km stretch from Mazhama to Baramulla.         
	On Wednesday, Singh, watched by Mamata and Sonia, is scheduled to inaugurate the 18km stretch from Anantnag to Qazigund, the first major entry point in Kashmir.         
	We were promised a rail link to the country but got a toy train between Qazigund and Baramulla because of its limited reach and it is being inaugurated for a third time, said the PDP leader.        
	What now remains is a further 171km between Udhampur and Qazigund, with a tortuous 130km stretch from Katra to Qazigund.        
	The 130km Katra-Qazigund stretch is the most difficult part of this project, which passes through rough terrain. Imagine how many more Prime Ministers will have to come to inaugurate this in bits, said the PDP leader.        
	Railway officials in Srinagar said the cost estimates for the Udhampur-Qazigund line have skyrocketed to Rs 11,000 crore and will rise more in case of further delay. The deadline has already been extended to 2019 and even that seems remote now, a government official said.        
	At least one fixture has not changed all these years, though. The separatists have called a strike on Wednesday.

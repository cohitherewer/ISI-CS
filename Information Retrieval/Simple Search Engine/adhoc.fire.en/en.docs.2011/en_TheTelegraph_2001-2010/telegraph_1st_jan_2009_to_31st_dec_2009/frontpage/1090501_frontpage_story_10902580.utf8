The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | MPA stakes claim to govt
                                                                                                           MPA stakes claim to govt
  - Meghalaya alliance submits list of 27 MLAs plus Speaker          OUR CORRESPONDENT                                    
	Shillong, April 30: A delegation of the Meghalaya Progressive Alliance (MPA), led by its newly elected legislature party leader J.D. Rymbai, met Meghalaya Governor R.S. Mooshahary this evening and staked claim to form the government after submitting a list of 27 legislators, excluding the Speaker.         
	Rymbai told the governor that as the effective strength of the Assembly was 55, after the disqualification of four legislators and resignation of UDP legislator Ampareen Lyngdoh, the MPA could form the government with its 28 legislators, including the Speaker, whereas the Congress had only 27 MLAs.         
	In the case of a trial of strength, the Speakers vote would be the deciding factor for the MPAs survival as during the confidence motion on March 17.         
	However, though the MPA had won the trust vote on March 17, the governor did not accept it, leading to recommendation of Presidents rule.         
	Rymbai told reporters after the meeting with the governor that the MPA was confident of forming the government if the governor called them.                                            
	The governor did not give any commitment to the demand of the MPA legislators. He only said he would wait for the withdrawal of Presidents rule, Rymbai said.        
	The governor also told the MPA delegates that he would also wait for the outcome of the court verdict on the four disqualified legislators, as a petition against the disqualification order of the Speaker is pending in the Supreme Court.         
	The MPA leaders hoped that the governor would correct his earlier stand of not considering as legal the winning of trust vote by the alliance on March 17.        
	The situation now is no different from that of March 17, as the Speakers deciding vote would still be essential for the MPA to prove its majority.        
	The MPA legislators pointed out that the Speaker had the right to cast his vote in case of a tie and it would very much be constitutional.         
	The MPAs move to stake claim to form the government has evoked criticism from the state Congress.         
	Senior Congress legislator Charles Pyngrope told The Telegraph that with a wafer thin majority and shifting loyalties, the MPA could not form the government.        
	The MPA does not have enough numbers to form the government and we hope that after the court vacates the disqualification order against the four legislators, who are on our side, we will be able to form the government, he added.        
	According to Pyngrope, the Congress, which is the single largest party, should be invited to form the government and if it cannot form the government, mid-term poll is the ideal option.

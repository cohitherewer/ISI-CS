The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Safe indoors, Tytler plans poll ploy
                                                                                                           Safe indoors, Tytler plans poll ploy
          ANANYA SENGUPTA                            Tytler                                  
	New Delhi, April 7: Jagdish Tytler was safely ensconced at home when his party colleague, P. Chidambaram, fielded a shoe on his behalf. He stayed indoors the rest of the day.        
	Journalist Jarnail Singh flung a footwear at the Union home minister at a news conference today, angered by the CBI clean chit to 1984 riots accused Tytler, and the Congresss decision to field him this election.        
	Its not clear if Tytler, 65, had watched the incident on television. He was busy drawing up plans and working out strategies for his election campaign with supporters at his home in Friends Colony, east Delhi.        
	Later, talking to reporters, he rubbished reports that his party was reconsidering his nomination.        
	For me the case is closed. You newspaper people will have to decide what you must do with your colleague, PTI quoted him as saying.        
	Tytler, a sitting MP contesting from the North-East Delhi constituency, very probably had a hand in organising the anti-Sikh riots, the Nanavati Commission had said. The probe panel said it had found credible evidence against the Congress leader.        
	Tytler claimed innocence, saying the alleged evidence had resulted from mistaken identity. On August 10, 2005, the President accepted his resignation from the Union ministry on Prime Minister Manmohan Singhs recommendation.        
	In late 2007, the CBI asked the trial court for permission to close the case against Tytler, saying it did not have sufficient evidence against him. The court rejected the agency plea.        
	By then, a witness in the 1984 riots case, California-based truck driver Jasbir Singh, had appeared on a news channel to say the CBI had never contacted him to depose against Tytler.        
	Jasbir, in his statement to the Nanavati Commission, had alleged he had heard Tytler incite a mob to kill Sikhs on November 3, 1984, three days after the assassination of Prime Minister Indira Gandhi by two Sikh bodyguards.        
	In an interview to a newspaper last year, Jasbir said he was reluctant to come to India to testify because of threats made against him and his family in the past.        
	He alleged that Tytlers men had called him up several times, threatened him, and asked him to withdraw from the case.        
	In December 2008, a two-member CBI team, sent to Jasbirs home in Californias Bay Area, recorded his statement along with those of 10 other witnesses who were in America.        
	But it wasnt enough, the CBI said. It gave Tytler a clean chit on April 2, triggering protests by Sikhs.         
	Sources said the CBI report had dubbed the witness accounts inconsistent and contradictory.

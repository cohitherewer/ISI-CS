                                                                                                           Bahu to brothers in Bellary
  - Sonias shelter-seat now showcase of money muscle           DEVDAN MITRA AND AJAY SUKUMARAN IN BELLARY                            N.Y. Hanumanthappa, the Congresss Bellary candidate; Sonia Gandhi                                       
	If the Gandhis again look for a bailout seat, it had better not be Bellary.        
	Ten years after Sonia Gandhi chose the northern Karnataka constituency as a cover in case the going got rocky on the family turf of Amethi, the iron ore and jeans district of Bellary has not quite forgotten what is seen as a betrayal.        
	Sonia, who won a famous victory over the BJPs Sushma Swaraj and settled the swadeshi nari versus videshi bahu debate once and for all, also triumphed at Amethi. The Congress president retained the family pocketborough and never came back to Bellary, also considered a party fortress until 1999.        
	They are all the same, they come for votes when it suits them. Be it Sonia or any other leader. Now we have become smarter, we say jai to all candidates. But we will vote for who we think is the best, says Manjunath, a young villager in S. Gangalapura hamlet near the mining town of Sandur, 60km from Bellary, where the Congress won an Assembly seat in 2008.        
	The Congress won the byelection after Sonia resigned the Bellary seat in 1999, but chose to field a non-political person, Kolur Basavanagouda, president of the Veerashaiva Vidyavardhak Sangha, which runs many educational institutions in the district.        
	In 2004, the tide turned with the BJP wresting the seat, backed by the Reddy brothers, the mining magnates whose rise has been meteoric. The brothers  Karunakara, Janardhana, Somashekhara  first came into the public domain when they helped the BJP campaign against Sonia.        
	A hotel official, who requested not to be quoted, recalled in a hushed and almost reverential tone how the brothers, sons of a police constable, would even until a decade ago ride two-wheelers. Now they own several swanky cars and other vehicles, and have come to symbolise the power and might of Bellary, though most of their mines are in neighbouring Andhra Pradesh. Janardhana Reddy is also known for his proximity to the Congress chief minister in Hyderabad, Y.S.R. Reddy.                           
	This time as well, the Reddy brothers are said to have thrown their collective might behind the BJP, which has fielded J. Shantha, its only woman candidate in Karnataka.        
	The small town of Bellary, about 60km from Hampi, the erstwhile mighty capital of the Vijayanagar kingdom, is known for its political intensity and show of wealth, which went up manifold when price of iron ore soared in the run-up to the Beijing Olympics in 2008. China imported huge amounts.         
	Bellarys money power is evident from the fleet of swanky SUVs that whiz through the narrow roads and the highway leading to Sandur and Hospet, dotted by the many sponge iron plants that have come up.         
	The showpiece industry is JSW Steels 7-million-tonne steel plant in Vijaynagar  about 45km from Bellary town  which has its own integrated township, including an airport.         
	With all the cash flowing around, money muscle is on show. Around Rs 15 crore in cash allegedly meant for distribution during elections has been seized by election officials from Bellary till Monday.         
	Shanthamma, as the 35-year-old BJP nominee is known, is a homemaker with little experience in politics, but she happens to be the sister of Karnataka health minister B. Sreeramulu, the MLA from Bellary Rural who is referred to as the fourth brother in the Reddy mining clan.        
	Her candidature was also helped by the fact that Bellary has been made a reserved seat for Scheduled Tribes post delimitation.         
	Shanthamma, married to a businessman from Andhra Pradesh, belongs to the Valmiki Nayaka community, which, with over 3 lakh voters, is a strong force in the constituency with an electorate of 14 lakh.        
	The people of Bellary placed a lot of trust in Sonia Gandhi when they elected her, Shantha says. But what did she do? She did not even meet people to show her gratitude.         
	Look at Sushma Swaraj. She comes here every year for the Varamahalakshmi festival and mass marriages, even though she lost.         
	Shanthas campaign is cheer-led by Hells Angels kind of motorcycle-borne party cadre whose shrieks in their leaders support resembles a blood-curdling shout of victory, an almost smug approach to the election in which they realise the BJP has the edge, even though the constituency is one of three in the state where H.D. Deve Gowdas Janata Dal (Secular) hasnt put up a nominee in a show of solidarity with the Congress.         
	Shantha talks of development, time and again reminding voters about the BJPs achievements, and that of her brother and the Reddys as well, as she travels the dusty roads of Bellary, which, apart from its iron ore mines, is also referred to as the jeans city  several denim manufacturers have set up units here, the most visible being the Point Blank brand.         
	The Congress, which won only one of the nine Assembly segments in the constituency in the last state polls, is putting up a stiff fight, and has fielded retired Orissa High Court judge N.Y. Hanumanthappa, also from Shanthas community.         
	The candidature is smart as the Reddy brothers are said to hold the former judge in high regard and are loath to come out against him all guns blazing.         
	Also, the Congress is hoping that a straight fight with the BJP would help them consolidate the votes.         
	Since Sonias victory, when she got 51 per cent of the votes, the Congresss share plunged to 30 per cent in the five years to 2004. With the Dal (Secular), which got 26 per cent of the votes last time, not contesting this time, the Congress is looking to up its share. The BJPs Karunakara Reddy, of the mining clan, won the seat in 2004 with around 34 per cent votes.         
	The Congress has tried to make an issue, a la Singur, out of the proposed greenfield airport at Sirwar and Chaganur villages, on the outskirts of Bellary. Farmers, backed by the Congress, here fought with the administration as they refused to hand over 2,000 acres of their fertile agriculture land for the airport, which is aimed at catering to the entire industrial belt, including Bellary to Hospet and Hubli-Dharwad.         
	They have succeeded, at least for now, as the government has gone silent on the issue.         
	The Congress is our only support, says Khaji Bi of Sirwar, who cannot remember her age but says she has been in Bellary for over 50 years.         
	The BJP doesnt want to anger us ahead of the elections, but we sleep here at night, says the spunky lady, who lowers her voice as two men on motorcycles, the lotus fluttering, advance towards the woman seeing her chatting with outsiders.         
	To be sure, the BJP is everywhere in the district, and has earned some ire from the people as well for whats seen as its high-handedness. The Karnataka governments move of cracking down on digging for ore dust in revenue lands has left some 4 lakh people unemployed, and villagers say the land that was dug up cannot be tilled again.         
	The Congress fancies its chances on the anti-incumbency factor and the track record of the UPA government.         
	We expected 50 per cent of the (nine) seats in the Assembly elections, said Abdul Wahab, general secretary of Karnataka Pradesh Congress Committee and a former legislator from Bellary district.         
	In spite of this, the party feels the total margin of about 90,000 votes by which it lost to the BJP in these Assembly segments that make up the parliamentary constituency, shows the fight is still winnable. We feel we will definitely win this seat again, adds Wahab.         
	But not all are convinced. Its only one way, BJP, says auto-rickshaw driver H. Guruswamy, as he drives past the huge party office in the town, a sign perhaps of the BJPs larger than life image in the district.         
	Why? He is not sure. They have built roads...parks, the perception is that whatever has happened is because of them.         
	The BJP is also known to act fast and show the colour of money, not just when a resident needs cash for a wedding, but for digging borewells, or even a water treatment plant.         
	The Congress is hoping that this brazen power of the moolah, which also has ushered in high-handedness, will prove the BJPs undoing and then maybe Bellary would again be ready to welcome the party.         
	Yes, it (the BJP) is powerful. Any common citizen will tell you...but the people are not happy, says Wahab.               
	Bellary votes on April 23

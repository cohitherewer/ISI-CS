The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Paresh Barua calls for plebiscite
                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                Paresh Barua calls for plebiscite
          A STAFF REPORTER                                     
	Guwahati, Dec. 11: Ulfa commander-in-chief Paresh Barua today offered a Hobsons choice to the government  either include sovereignty in the talks or conduct a plebiscite among the indigenous people of the state.        
	New Assam Governor J.B. Patnaik, however, tried to keep the peace process on track by inviting Ulfa for unconditional talks.        
	Barua, in an e-mailed statement, said his option was the last word of those who were still not in the enemys clutches.         
	A source said while Baruas statement allowed the leaders in custody, including Ulfa chairman Arabinda Rajkhowa, to have their views, talks with these captive leaders are unlikely to restore peace in the state given that the Ulfas strength lies in its military, which Barua controls. He said the government could not accept either of the options.         
	Barua said Indian democracy did not practice peoples democracy. Indias claim about being the biggest democracy in the world is nothing but a propaganda. In reality there are no democratic rights. People of Assam are being suppressed by the Indian occupational forces and for the people of Assam democracy has no meaning.         
	He said since plebiscite was a part of peoples democracy, it was the duty of the occupation forces to consider a peoples referendum for Assam.         
	We will continue to fight against the Indian occupational forces unless they agree to hold discussion on sovereignty or conduct a plebiscite, the statement said.         
	The statement said Indian democracy had turned into a party democracy with political parties in power working only in their interest.         
	Within an hour of being sworn in this evening, Governor J.B. Patnaik said, The home minister has invited them (Ulfa) to come to the negotiating table. I have also invited them today. They should come for talks unconditionally. I dont believe in violent methods. There is enough scope in the Constitution to settle any problem without resorting to violence, he told reporters at the Raj Bhavan.

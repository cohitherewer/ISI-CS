                                                                                                           Lalu banks on turncoats
          SUMAN K. SHRIVASTAVA AND NALIN VERMA                              
	Ranchi/Patna, March 25: After days of suspense, Lalu Prasad today fielded turncoats in two of the four seats the RJD is contesting in Jharkhand.         
	The RJD chief named Bihar JD(U) rebel Nagmani for the Chatra Lok Sabha seat to take on former Speaker Inder Singh Namdhari, thereby denying a ticket to sitting MP Dhirendra Agrawal.         
	In Koderma, Lalu Prasad named Pranav Verma, a BJP rebel, to take on heavyweight Babulal Marandi. In Palamau, he renominated Ghuran Ram.         
	As for Rajmahal, the RJD chief has hopes on Congress rebel MLA Thomas Hansda, but refrained from formally announcing his name as Hansda was still keeping open back channels of communication with his parent party.        
	I will go the house of others only when I do not have my own, Hansda said, indicating he still believed the Congress would allow him a friendly fight in Rajmahal.         
	Understandably, Lalu Prasads decision has left many in his party bitter. At least two RJD legislators, Girinath Singh and Annapurna Devi, were hoping to contest from Chatra and Koderma respectively.        
	And Agrawal, who seemed to have guessed his fate, was lobbying with the Congress for a ticket. Now, he wants to contest as an Independent.         
	Nagmani has both naag (serpents king) and mani (precious stone), Lalu Prasad declared in his inimitable style in Patna today, accusing Nitish Kumar of cold shouldering the extremely backward classes.        
	Nagmani, agriculture minister in Nitishs cabinet, quit JD(U) after being denied a ticket from Ujiarpur in Bihar. He was even more upset after the chief minister bypassed his wife and former minister Suchitra Sinha and gave the seat to Ashwamedh Devi.         
	Son of firebrand socialist leader Jagdeo Prasad, Nagmani, who won the Chatra seat in 1999 as a powerful leader of the Kushwaha caste, has changed parties half-a-dozen times in the past one-and-a-half decades. He said he was nursing the Ujiarpur constituency for the last three years and should have been the JD(U) candidate from there.         
	Nagmani crossed over to the BJP later and became a minister in the Vajpayee Government. After the BJP denied him a ticket in the 2004 elections, he joined Ram Vilas Paswans LJP in Bihar.         
	Asserting that he wasnt an outsider in Chatra, Nagmani told The Telegraph he was launching his campaign from tomorrow and would file his nomination on March 30. My only target is to defeat the NDA, he added.

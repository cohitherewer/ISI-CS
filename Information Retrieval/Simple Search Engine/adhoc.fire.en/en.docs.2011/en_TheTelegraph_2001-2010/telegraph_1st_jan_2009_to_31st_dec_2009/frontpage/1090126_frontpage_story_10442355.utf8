  - Awards list mirrors milestone events of year gone by          OUR BUREAU                                                
	Jan. 25: If a checklist of the last year of Manmohan Singhs first government has to be made, look no further than the Padma awards list made public today.        
	Between the lines that list a galaxy of names lie the signature events of 2008  the association self-evident in many cases and not so obvious in some.        
	The big surprise on the Padma Shri roster is Aishwarya Rai Bachchan, whose in-laws share a fraternal relationship with Amar Singh, a friend the UPA government found when Prakash Karat pulled the plug.        
	The issue that made Karat go ballistic  the nuclear deal  also finds an echo in the list of names for Padma awards, given by the government for exceptional service in various fields. Anil Kakodkar, the Atomic Energy Commission chairman who played a key role in getting the nuclear deal on track, will be given Padma Vibhushan  the big daddy of the Padma family. Bhushan and Shri, in that order, follow Vibhushan.        
	The Vibhushan list features the name of Sister Nirmala of the Missionaries of Charity in a year that followed months of atrocities against Christians in Orissa.        
	None of us at Mother House expected this. I dont deserve such an honour and am humbled by it, Sister Nirmala said.        
	The 74-year-old nun, who spent a few quiet moments by Mother Teresas Tomb after learning from The Telegraph that she had been conferred the award, said: This is a recognition by the Government of India of the little that we have been able to do for the poorest of the poor and it is to them that I want to dedicate the award.        
	If the list evokes memories of events that shaped politics and diplomacy and underscored the vulnerability of minorities, it also recalls some of the proudest moments for India last year.        
	Abhinav Bindra, who ended the decades-long wait for an individual gold in the Olympics, will be given the Padma Bhushan, while Mahendra Singh Dhoni, who led the cricket team through a spectacular year in all forms of the game, has been listed for the Padma Shri.         
	Isro chief G. Madhavan Nair, who steered the Chandrayaan mission and gifted the country its finest hour in space, will be conferred the Padma Vibhushan.        
	The other standout event of 2008  the attack on Mumbai  has been reflected in the gallantry awards.        
	Other than that of Aishwarya, another name from entertainment is reminiscent of the political quake that shook India in mid-2008. Around the same time Manmohan Singh had won the trust vote, another Singh was conquering the box office. Singh is Kinng stars Akshay Kumar, who is also on the Padma Shri list.         
	After the Padma list was out, the capitals political class tried to decipher Aishwaryas nomination. The Padma Shri will be a fillip to the roller-coaster Congress-Samajwadi Party relations, declared sources in both parties.        
	The awards are finalised on the basis of recommendations made by state governments, departments and institutions of excellence. The suggestions are vetted by a committee and the names announced after approval of the home minister, the Prime Minister and the President, according to the government.        
	Other sources downplayed the significance of Aishwaryas nomination, saying that at most, it might help some Samajwadi leaders boast that the award is a testimony to their clout. The award is unlikely to change anything between the Bachchans and the Nehru-Gandhis (whose relationship has been frosty). The big question is whether the Bachchans will campaign for the UPA, the answer to which cannot be gauged from this award, a source said.        
	The source pointed out there was no political interference when Amitabh Bachchan was given the government-sponsored national award for best actor in 2006 for Black.        
	A Padma for Aishwarya leaves Abhishek alone in the household without such an honour. Amitabh has received the Padma Shri (1984) and the Padma Bhushan (2001) and Jaya the Padma Shri (1992).        
	Besides Sister Nirmala, educationist D.P. Chattopadhyaya from Bengal will be given the Padma Vibhushan. Theatre artiste Saoli Mitra and mime artiste Niranjan Goswami will get the Padma Shri.

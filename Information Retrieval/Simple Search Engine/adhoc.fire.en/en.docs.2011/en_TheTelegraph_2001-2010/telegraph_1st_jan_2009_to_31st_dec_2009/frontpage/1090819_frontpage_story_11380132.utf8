          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                               
	New Delhi, Aug. 18: The pandemic flu virus is mild and the great majority of infected people recover without anti-viral treatment or hospitalisation, senior World Health Organisation officials said today.         
	The flu appears to be spreading through the community in some parts of India and screening travellers at international airports will have only limited effect on virus movement, the WHO officials said in a briefing on H1N1 pandemic patterns so far.         
	The virus has not changed  it is still causing mild and self-limiting disease in the vast majority of patients, said Jai Narain, director, communicable diseases division at the WHO South East Asia Regional Office here. He said the hospitalisation rate in Europe has been observed to be only 1 per cent to 2 per cent. Most people do not require the anti-viral oseltamivir, he said.         
	But a small set of patients deteriorate and develop severe disease, Narain said, adding that efforts should be aimed at identifying such patients early because they would need to be treated with the anti-viral drug.         
	Patients in high-risk category with underlying disease  or those who have fast progression of disease with symptoms such as breathlessness or chest pain or low blood pressure  would need quick treatment, Narain said.         
	In a large number of people, the infection may not lead to disease at all.         
	A study in the US suggested that the actual number of people infected may be as high as 1 million at a time when the number of laboratory-confirmed cases was only about 27,000, said Salim Habayeb, WHO representative in India.         
	The US analysis indicated that the number of infected people might be about 40 times higher than those who developed symptoms, Habayeb said. The figures are based on a model, but theyre based on good assumptions, he said.         
	Exposure (to the virus) generates immunity  but most people who are infected do not get the symptoms, they will develop immunity to the virus just as they do to other viruses, Habayeb said.         
	Patterns from Mexico  where this H1N1 virus flared up earlier this year  and other parts of the world indicate that the virus infections peak in a community within about four weeks and then decline over time.         
	Infectious diseases experts believe that the virus is likely to display a similar pattern in India  showing peaks and declining in towns where local community spread is occurring before turning up in a different part of the country.         
	Among 99 new patients from 22 cities across India who were found infected with H1N1 today, more than 90 had no history of foreign travel and had thus picked up the infection in their own communities.         
	With less than 10 per cent infections involving foreign travel  it is evident that community spread is occurring in India, a senior WHO official said. In this scenario, screening international travellers who arrive in India would have little value.         
	It (airport screening) is not a wrong thing  it provides a (health) service to the travellers who are found infected on arrival, the official said. But it provides only a marginal benefit because you need to screen a large number of passengers to find only a few persons infected.         
	India has deployed 225 doctors and 172 paramedics at 22 international airports. Some community health experts have been arguing that these resources should be redeployed to manage the flu within the country.         
	Health ministry figures released tonight show that India has so far detected 2,026 laboratory-confirmed H1N1 infections, including 25 persons who have died.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Trinamul shot at job taunt 
                                                                                                           Trinamul shot at job taunt 
          CHARU SUDAN KASTURI                               
	New Delhi, May 29: From its new perch in Delhi, the Trinamul Congress is preparing to take on the CPM over the alleged neglect of the rural job scheme in Bengal.        
	The minister of state for rural development, Sisir Adhikari, today briefed his boss C.P. Joshi on the alleged ineffective implementation of the UPAs flagship programme, and wanted his complaints raised before the cabinet.         
	The minister asked me to prepare a note on the lacunae in Bengals implementation of the NREGA. I will be doing so very soon, Adhikari told The Telegraph. All party ministers, except Mamata Banerjee, returned to Calcutta this evening.        
	Adhikari placed his demand on the new rural development ministrys first day in office. The demand was confirmed by sources close to rural development minister Joshi.        
	The sources suggested Joshi, said to have been hand-picked by Rahul Gandhi, would go through the note before deciding whether the situation was grave enough to be recommended for a cabinet discussion.        
	I know the ground reality in Bengal. That is why I have raised the issue of Bengal, though I am a representative of the country as a minister and am not parochial, Adhikari said.         
	The demand comes just a month after Rahul ripped apart Bengals rural development record, calling it worse than that of Uttar Pradesh.        
	Compared to 54.19 annual workdays for every labourer under the NREGA in Uttar Pradesh, Bengal workers were employed for 25.83 days every year on an average till March 31 this year. Under the law, each person must receive 100 days of work a year.         
	In contrast with the 77.4 per cent NREGA funds that Uttar Pradesh has utilised, Bengal has used 71.3 per cent.        
	Bengal is, however, marginally better than Uttar Pradesh in terms of granting job cards to families seeking employment under the law. Ninety-nine per cent of families that applied for NREGA jobs in Bengal have received work, compared to 98 per cent in Uttar Pradesh.         
	Adhikari said he had insisted that his ministry be represented in a central team headed by the home ministry that would have to assess the damage caused by Cyclone Aila before central aid is granted.         
	Home ministry officials said they were yet to receive a memorandum from Bengal. Chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee had written to the Prime Minister seeking a Rs 1,000-crore grant.

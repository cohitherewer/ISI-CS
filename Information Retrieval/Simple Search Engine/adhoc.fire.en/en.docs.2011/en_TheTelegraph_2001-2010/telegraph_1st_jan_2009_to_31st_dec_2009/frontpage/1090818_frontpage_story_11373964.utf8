The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | A nose for Basmatis roots
                                                                                                           A nose for Basmatis roots
  - Aroma tied to non-South Asia variety but mystery lingers           G.S. MUDUR                             Biryani made with Basmati rice                                        
	New Delhi, Aug. 17: The fragrance of Basmati has its roots in an ancestral form of Japonica rice and not in Indica, a distinct group widely cultivated in South Asia, a new study of rice genes has suggested.         
	The study by plant geneticists Susan McCouch and Michael Kovach at Cornell University in the US has shown that a variant of a rice gene called BADH2 that plays a key role in producing fragrance in rice emerged in the Japonica group, which is the ancestor of the modern-day Basmati. The studys findings appear in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences today.         
	Scientists believe the earliest domestication of rice occurred around 8000 BC in China. But the origins of fragrant rice such as Basmati or Jasmine  a variety from Thailand  have remained unclear.         
	Previous studies have suggested that the Japonica variety  with short grains and sticky on cooking  was domesticated in southern China while Indica  with long grains and non-sticky  emerged in eastern India or Southeast Asia.         
	The new study has suggested that the BADH2 gene variant originated in a Japonica-like ancestor and a gene variant found in most fragrant Indica varieties, including Thai Jasmine, was inherited from a Basmati-like ancestor.         
	But we cannot say yet when or where this ancestral variety of rice first emerged or was first cultivated, said McCouch, professor at the department of plant breeding and genetics at Cornell University.         
	McCouch said the findings neither confirm nor reject the hypothesis that Basmati rice originated in the Indian subcontinent. We have no data to say where or when Basmati was first domesticated, she told The Telegraph.         
	But McCouch as well as other rice researchers point out that the new work does not in any way dilute the distinct character of Basmati or the geographical association of Basmati with South Asia.         
	Basmati rice is not defined exclusively on the basis of fragrance from the BADH2 gene. Basmati also has other important traits such as softness and a 2.5-fold grain elongation on cooking, rice geneticists in India said.         
	The BADH2 is a major factor, but there may be other genes that also contribute to fragrance in rice, said a senior Indian scientist who has been working on Basmati.         
	Five years ago, McCouch and researchers Sunita Jain and Rajinder Jain at the Haryana Agricultural University in Hisar showed that Basmati was genetically distinct and appeared to have a long, independent evolution in southern Asia. The new study substantiates that South Asia is home to both Indica and Japonica rice, with Basmati being an example of Japonica.         
	This is a thorough analysis giving us an evolutionary perspective on fragrance in rice, said Javaregowda Nagaraju, a scientist at the Centre for DNA Fingerprinting in Hyderabad. Analysing more genes in Basmati traits may throw more light on its evolution and domestication, said Nagaraju, who had helped identify genetic signatures for Basmati rice varieties five years ago.         
	The big mystery of Basmati is when it was first domesticated  no one knows yet.

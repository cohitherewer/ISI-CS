          OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Feb. 3: Credit card holders can be charged penal interest above 30 per cent a year for delayed payments or defaults till the Supreme Court disposes of a case filed by some foreign banks.        
	The rates have been freed again for the time being after the court stayed a consumer forum order that imposed the 30 per cent ceiling. Some banks used to charge between 36 per cent and 40 per cent as penal interest before the national consumer court issued the order.        
	The Supreme Court order came on a petition filed by banks such as HSBC, Standard Chartered, Citibank and American Express  the last two struggling to cope with the global financial meltdown.        
	The same bench had issued notices to the parties concerned on September 11 last year but had refrained from staying the order.        
	The National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission had ordered the interest cap in July on a petition filed by two consumer groups, Awaz and Jagrit Grahak.        
	Appearing for the banks, counsel Abhishek Manu Singhvi said a consumer forum could not interfere with the institutions power to decide their interest rates. Only the Reserve Bank can, he said.        
	The banks said in their petition that the cap was contrary to the RBI policy that stated banks were free to determine rates of interest on non-priority sector personal loans without reference to Benchmark Prime Lending Rate (BPLR) and regardless of the size of loan.        
	Singhvi pointed out that since the court had not stayed the consumer forum order, the two consumer groups have sought to enforce the 30 per cent ceiling for defaults or delayed payments. He sought an immediate stay on the forum order till the apex court decided the matter.        
	The consumer commission had issued its order on a petition filed by a Delhi resident, Pradeep Kumar Thakur. In our view, charging of interest in excess of 30 per cent shall be considered usurious rate of interest and that if such rate of interest is charged, it would amount to unfair trade practice, the forum had said.         
	Before the forum, the RBI had said market forces would determine interest rates based on demand and supply. The credit card companies said the interest rates were steep because of the high rate of default and non-availability of credit histories of consumers.         
	But the forum pointed out that the then average rate of interest on bank loans was around 15 per cent.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Vulgar? But pay yet to cross the limit
                                                                                                           Vulgar? But pay yet to cross the limit
          OUR BUREAU                                              
	Oct. 5: Business chambers and the Centre are debating the pros and cons of regulating corporate salaries but many big companies appear to be paying their top guns way below the legal limit set by the government.        
	The Companies Act of 1956 permits all business entities to pay a managerial remuneration of up to 11 per cent of its net profits. The managerial remuneration is the sum of all payments made to the chief executive and its whole-time directors.        
	Reliance Industries, the countrys largest private conglomerate, paid out just 0.35 per cent of its net profit of Rs 19,548 crore in 2007-08 as managerial remuneration to four directors holding executive responsibilities: Mukesh Ambani, the Meswani brothers Nikhil and Hital, and executive director Hardev Singh Kohli.         
	The total payout by RIL in 2007-08 was Rs 67.53 crore  with Mukesh Ambani receiving Rs 44 crore while the Meswani brothers (cousins of Mukesh) got Rs 11.12 crore each. Kohli was paid Rs 1.26 crore.        
	A CMIE analysis of 14 Nifty-listed companies that have already filed their annual reports for 2008-09 shows that 13 paid a managerial remuneration of less than 1 per cent of their net profits. Only one  Cairn India  paid 3.7 per cent of its net profit with its managerial remuneration capped at Rs 28.46 crore.        
	Among professional chief executives, engineering and construction giant L amp;Ts chairman and managing director A.M. Naik ranked high with a total remuneration of Rs 12.55 crore.        
	Theres a catch: experts at several pay and compensation consultants said it would be difficult to compute the value of stock options that companies dole out these days in the absence of adequate data for evaluation.        
	Take the case of Reliance Industries: the Meswani brothers received stock options of 7 lakh each in 2007-08. The company issued stock options on three different dates and at three different exercise prices.        
	A day after corporate affairs minister Salman Khursheed set a cat among business high-fliers,corporate chieftains in their individual capacity chose to stay mum as the government appeared to ratchet up pressure to trim the vulgar salaries.        
	Khursheed, who on Sunday asked companies to stop paying hefty salaries to their top managers, clarified today that the government had no desire to control remuneration in India Inc but there would have to be some regulation.        
	I am not for control. I am for regulationIt is impossible to say that we will shut our eyes and let anybody do what they please, he said.        
	The display of affluence is unacceptable, he added. We follow the footsteps of Mahatma Gandhi and are trying to lead our life with simplicity.        
	Planning Commission deputy chairman Montek Singh Ahluwalia joined the debate by saying that there was a global concern over what companies paid their top managers.        
	Ahluwalia said governments worldwide had spoken about the need to cap the pay packets and hefty bonuses of top managers, especially banking and financial entities, on the ground that they encourage risky behaviour.         
	While most chieftains declined to comment, Venugopal Dhoot, chairman and managing director of Videocon Industries, came up with a cryptic riposte: The Bhagvad Gita has suggested that a person should be rewarded in accordance to his deeds. Similarly, executives should be paid as per their contribution to the profits of a business entity.        
	India Inc left it to the chambers of commerce to articulate its deep misgivings about any attempt to trammel the companies rights to pay market-determined salaries to retain talent.        
	Ficci and Assocham said any move to place curbs on the remuneration package would lead to a flight of talent from Indian shores.         
	We might see flight of talent from the country. We have already seen that 15 to 20 years ago there was massive brain drain from the nation as our best and brightest got opportunities to earn many times more in foreign countries, particularly the west, said Ficci president Harshpati Singhania.        
	He added: On an average, Indian executives gets about one hundredth of the amount earned by their western counterparts. Any move to push this ratio even further down would be detrimental to the performance of our companies.        
	The Confederation of Indian Industry has always believed corporates have a social responsibility and always supported self-regulation, said chamber president Venu Srinivasan.        
	We would broadly support the idea of self-regulation. In other countries, institutional investors and the broader stock markets tend to regulate executive compensation. This is what India should be heading towards, said Watson Wyatt country manager Dhritiman Chakrabarti.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Manchester United gets Indian millions
                                                                                                           Manchester United gets Indian millions
  - Airtel seals content deal with club           AMIT ROY                                                    
	London, May 8: Manchester United may be seen in action in India before too long because of a sponsorship deal struck today between the club and mobile phone operator Bharti Airtel.        
	The five-year agreement was announced by United CEO David Gill, manager Alex Ferguson and Bharti Airtel deputy CEO Sanjay Kapoor. Reports said the deal was worth 10m but the figure was not officially confirmed.        
	To indicate they meant serious business and that this was possibly the start of an enduring relationship between United and Indias sports-crazy millions, some of the clubs big names  Wayne Rooney, Carlos Tevez and Darren Fletcher  too were present at Old Trafford.        
	This is a very exciting development because India is an area of commercial potential, Gill said. We are looking at everything. Some might work, others might not. I am sure Manchester United will play a game in India at some stage, although there is no commitment to do it just yet.        
	Airtel expects to pick up between 10 and 20 million extra subscribers purely because of its tie-up with United, with Ferguson confident that both sides would gain.        
	If you give an opportunity to young people they surprise you, he remarked. Football is accelerating fast behind cricket and one day I hope to see a young Indian boy wearing the red strip of United.        
	With recession hitting most of the developed world, this could be the ideal time for United to look for sponsorships from India.         
	Analysts, however, said United had long viewed India as ripe for commercial expansion, with Gill looking at the Airtel deal as the key that might unlock the country. The club has made it clear the deal is not a shirt sponsorship.        
	We are very proud to have Bharti Airtel as the first Indian company to partner with Manchester United Club. This major partnership will bring the action and passion of Manchester United directly to the millions of fans of Manchester United across India and other Asian countries, Gill said in a formal statement.        
	The club will now supply football content to Airtels estimated 100 million subscribers in India, Sri Lanka and the Seychelles. It will also take its highly rated soccer skills programme into India in an effort to reach a percentage of the 560 million young people in the country.        
	Indian food is the English national dish, there is no reason why English football should not become the Indian national game, commented Uniteds commercial director Richard Arnold. There is an affinity between India and the UK.        
	Indias success in running the Indian Premier League, even though it was banished this year to South Africa, may have helped persuade United to enter into football matrimony with Airtel.        
	Football is going through a metamorphosis in India, Airtels Kapoor said. Both 20-over cricket and soccer bring the instant gratification the youth of India love and the name Manchester United rings bells around the world.        
	His formal statement explained the logic of the deal  a marriage between two premier brands.        
	We are very excited to partner with Manchester United, a powerful brand with a huge following across the world and in India. Football is definitely seeing a growing interest amongst the young population in India. Therefore, we are making a pioneering effort to bring them rich football content on their mobiles, a fantastic opportunity to be part of the worlds leading football club through participation in soccer schools, and also an opportunity to watch football matches across Europe.

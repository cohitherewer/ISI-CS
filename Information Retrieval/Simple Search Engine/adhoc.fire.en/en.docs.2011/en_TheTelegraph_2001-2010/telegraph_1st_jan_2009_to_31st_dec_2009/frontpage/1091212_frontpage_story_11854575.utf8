The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | 3-time MLA on sticky wicket
                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                3-time MLA on sticky wicket
  - For once, Balmuchu running scared          JAYESH THAKER                                          
	Ghatshila, Dec. 11: Pradeep Kumar Balmuchu was not his usual self as he went from street to street on the last leg of campaigning. His signature nonchalance was missing, in its place was a touch of despondency.         
	The PCC chiefs prospects in Ghatshila did not appear good.        
	His problems are many, including poor rapport with some senior leaders in the state Congress, and he is working overtime to retain the seat for the fourth time in a row.        
	I have faith in the voters of Ghatshila. They are aware of my performance. Its for them to decide, Balmuchu said yesterday on the sidelines of his roadshow.         
	Those who know him will agree his uncharacteristically tame reply was an indication of how tough things have got for him, one of the Congresss chief ministerial aspirants.        
	Balmuchu refused to talk about the Congresss new-found friendship with the JVM  not surprising since he was opposing a tie-up initially  and instead reeled off a list of his achievements as MLA of Ghatshila for 15 long years, perhaps more to convince himself than his voters.        
	With a section of his own partymen having turned against him  a few delegations reached Delhi to demand his ouster  Balmuchu had a terrible time within the Congress in the run up to the Assembly elections.         
	Ask him about those days, and he is dismissive. Everything is fine within the party, he claimed.         
	And to those who question his contribution as a longtime MLA, his response is with anger. Pahle gaon me jaiye phir dekhiye ki vikas hua hain ki nahin. Maine char setu aur jal minar banwaye hain. Yeh sab vikas nahin to kya hain (First go the villages and see whether development has taken place or not. Four bridges and a water tower have come up during my tenure as MLA. If that is not development, what is), he asked.        
	The battle in Ghatshila has boiled down to a direct contest between Balmuchu and JMMs Ramdas Soren. If Balmuchu sounded cautiously confident, voters of his constituency didnt paint a rosy picture of his prospects  the poor response to his road show was indicative of that.        
	The problem, as few of his supporters now admit, is that in Ghatshila the Congress candidate had an image problem.        
	Balmuchus coterie takes commissions in his name while dishing out contracts in villages. This practice has been going on for quite a long time and hasnt gone down well with the electorate, said Ghanshyam Tudu, an expert who has been keeping tabs on the local political scenario for several years now.        
	And that Congress stalwarts Sonia Gandhi and Pranab Mukherjee had come here to campaign seems to have backfired on Balmuchu, highlighting his weak position instead of shoring up his chances.        
	In the end, Ghatshila could well be a photo finish.         
	Soren lost to Balmuchu by 15,000 votes the last time when he contested as an Independent. Now, he is with the JMM. It is going to make a difference, said Kalicharan Mahto, a teacher in a village school, summing up the popular mood.        
	Chief minister? No, he couldnt be thinking about that now. It is for the party high command and senior leaders to decide, he said.

          OUR CORRESPONDENT                               
	Imphal, April 12: Security forces have mounted a major offensive to neutralise militants in Loktak Lake, one of Manipurs best known tourist destinations, ahead of Lok Sabha elections.         
	Nongmaikhong, the eastern part of Loktak was virtually under siege, as three army and Assam Rifle battalions launched the operation last evening.         
	Villagers said the army was using a chopper, boats, local guides and an unmanned aerial surveillance vehicle, known as spy plane, during the operation.         
	Troops started arriving at 7pm yesterday and cordoned the Nongmaikhong area of the lake, including the floating Keibul Lamjao National Park, the only remaining home to Sangai, a threatened deer species.         
	Loktak lake is primarily located in Bishnupur district and stretches up to Thoubal district. Spread over 40 square km, the lake is about 48km from Imphal city.         
	Several fishermens families live inside the lake in huts constructed on phumdis (floating bio-mass).         
	The troops have not allowed any one to enter the area where the operation is on. We started hearing gunshots around 5am this morning and intermittent firing sounds could be heard till around noon, Sarat Singh, a fisherman, said.         
	The villagers said the troops also searched Keibul Lamjao National Park and that they could see smoke emanating from the lake.         
	Army spokesman Col Rajesh Mishra today said three camps of the Peoples Revolutionary Party of Kangleipak (Prepak) were destroyed inside the lake, adding one militant was killed and one AK series rifle recovered.         
	Details of the operation are not yet available at the army spokespersons office though.         
	As the operation is still on, information is yet to come in. There could be more casualties on the militant side. There was no injury or casualty on the forces side, the spokesman said.         
	He denied the use of helicopter by the raiding parties during the operation but added that one chopper was used to transport senior officers to oversee the operation.         
	Todays operation was part of the efforts by the security forces to sanitise the lake and surrounding areas in view of the Lok Sabha election.         
	The security forces have taken extra vigil in view of the Lok Sabha elections, particularly in the valley areas where militants are very active. The operation in the lake is a part of this drive, the spokesman said.         
	This is the second major operation inside the lake since September 9 last year. In last years operation launched jointly by the army and police, commandos had gunned down five cadres of the Peoples Revolutionary Party of Kangleipak. The then GOC 57th Mountain Division Maj. Gen. T.S. Handa had personally overseen the operation.

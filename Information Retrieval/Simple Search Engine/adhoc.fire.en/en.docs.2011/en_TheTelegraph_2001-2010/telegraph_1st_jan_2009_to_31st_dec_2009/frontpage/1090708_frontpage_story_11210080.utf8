          PIYA SINGH                               
	Mumbai, July 7: The abolition of the fringe benefit tax has sparked concerns that employees may have to shoulder the burden of the giveaway.        
	The fine print in budget documents indicates that the employees could end up paying tax on several perquisites for which the companies were paying FBT.        
	The fear stems from speculation among tax experts over a new set of rules the finance ministry could frame to change the methodology for calculating the value of perquisites and expand the list of taxable perks in the hands of the employees.        
	The confusion arises over a line in the explanatory memorandum that accompanies the Finance Bill, which reads: It is proposed to insert a new section 115WM to abolish the fringe benefit tax. Consequently, it is also proposed to restore the taxation of the fringe benefits as perquisites in the hands of the employees.        
	The explanation went on to add: Perquisites shall also include the value of any other fringe benefit or amenity as may be prescribed. This suggests that the list of taxable perquisites could grow.        
	The government earned Rs 8,500 crore last year through the fringe benefit tax and it might want to claw back a part of the revenue forgone by taxing employees.        
	Historically, the perquisites were taxed under Section 17 of the Income Tax Act and Rule 3 of the IT Rules. When the FBT came along in 2005, there were some overlaps between the two lists meant for employees and employers. If the employer paid the FBT, the employee wasnt taxed for the same perk.        
	The proposed amendment under Section 17 that states perquisites shall include the value of any other fringe benefit as may be prescribed leaves the door wide open for additional items that could be taxed as perquisites by the government, said PricewaterhouseCoopers executive director Rajiv Anand.        
	So far, items like motor cars, interest-free loans, travel and tours, free food and non-alcoholic beverages, gift vouchers, club memberships and any movable assets given by the employer to the employee, featured in Rule 3 of the IT Rules.        
	Other items that employees paid tax on included accommodation provided by the employer and cheap loans given by the employer. These were read in conjunction with Rule 3.         
	The FBT list  which applied to employers  contained 17 items. Employees did not pay tax on these 17 items even if they figured in the IT Rules.         
	So, for instance, travel, club memberships and gifts were not taxed in the hands of the employee under Rule 3 but in the hands of the employer who paid FBT on these.        
	The Finance Bill 2009 also says that employee stock options (ESOPs) and superannuation benefits over Rs 1 lakh will now be taxed in the employees hands.         
	Tax experts are confused whether in the absence of an FBT, the valuation method under Rule 3 will automatically apply or whether the amendment to taxation of perquisites in budget 2009-10 indicates that the ministry will issue a new valuation method.        
	There is a lack of clarity whether Rule 3 automatically applies once the FBT is abolished or whether a new valuation method will be prescribed, said BSR amp; Co partner (tax) Parizad Sirwalla.

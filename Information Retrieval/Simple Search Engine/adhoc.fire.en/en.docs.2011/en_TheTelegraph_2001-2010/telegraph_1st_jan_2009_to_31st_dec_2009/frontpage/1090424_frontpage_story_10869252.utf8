The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Advani courts region parties 
                                                                                                           Advani courts region parties 
  - BJP overture follows PMs frown        MANINI CHATTERJEE                                                     
	Unnao (Uttar Pradesh), April 23: L.K. Advani, the BJPs prime ministerial candidate, today sharply criticised the Congresss antipathy towards regional parties and asserted that the BJP  despite being the only other national party  viewed the growth of regional outfits as a positive phenomenon.        
	Advanis remarks, made in course of a free-wheeling conversation with The Telegraph while he chopper-stopped his way through central Uttar Pradesh today, were clearly made with an eye on the post-poll scenario when both the Congress and the BJP will be in a race to woo smaller parties to form a viable coalition.         
	In a clear reference to Prime Minister Manmohan Singhs recent comment that regional parties were holding up the countrys development, Advani said: Nowadays, the Congress has been criticising regional parties. I do not agree with that. I think just as the BJP played a role in ending the hegemony of the Congress at the national level, parties such as the Akali Dal, the DMK and the AIADMK, the TDP and others have played a very significant role, too.         
	The emergence of purely casteist parties may be worrisome, but regional parties are a positive phenomenon.         
	The Congress, he said, was critical of regional parties not from an ideological viewpoint but because it could not come to terms with changing reality that had ended single-party dominance in India.         
	The Congresss approach is that they have ruled and should continue to rule  they continue to harbour an antipathy towards smaller parties, an allergy towards coalitions, Advani said.        
	The BJPs earlier avatar, Jana Sangh, on the other hand, had formed a coalition with the Akalis back in the 1960s and the BJP continues to hold regional partners in esteem as borne out by the NDA experiment at the Centre and coalitions in the states, he said.         
	Advani denied that the BJP was making a virtue out of necessity since it did not have a presence in many states and needed coalition partners.         
	Ideally speaking, every party would like to form a government of its own. But given the size of the country, the different stages of development and democracy in the country, adjusting with regional parties is an imperative.         
	Elaborating, he said: Every national party has an ambition. But arrangements of the kind we have made with the Akali Dal or the Janata Dal (U) or that we make with some other party  if they stabilise and endure, there is nothing wrong with it. Their interest is focused on the state and ours at the Centre  there is no contradiction, it is a complementary relationship.        
	Advanis comments appeared aimed at parties which had once been part of the NDA but had now joined either the UPA or were part of the third front.         
	On the third front, Advani repeatedly asserted that no such front was possible without the support of either the Congress or the BJP. Barring V.P. Singh in 1989, all so-called third front Prime Ministers had been proteges of the Congress and were interim arrangements.        
	In other words, a non-Congress, non-BJP alternative was a chimera, and even if it was headed by a person outside these two parties, it would be dependent on one or the other.         
	The BJP leader refused to get drawn into discussions on post-poll scenarios except to assert that the BJP will emerge as the single largest party and the NDA the largest combination.        
	When it was pointed out that a 1996 scenario could be re-enacted (when the BJP was the single largest party but the United Front government was formed with outside Congress support), Advani said: There is a difference between 1996 and now. At that time, no one except the Akali Dal and the Shiv Sena were willing to support us.         
	Subsequently, however, that feeling of untouchability towards the BJP has not been there. So much so that both the regional parties of Tamil Nadu, the TDP and others have been part of the NDA.         
	He refused to attach too much importance to statements by Omar Abdullah and Ram Vilas Paswan who had since publicly regretted their decision to be in the NDA and appeared to be confident that many erstwhile allies would be back in the fold if the numbers added up.         
	Without spelling it out, he seemed to indicate that the emphasis on secularism as a guiding principle would not be a stumbling block if the BJP won more seats than the Congress.        
	The BJP, he said, did not consider any party untouchable, barring the Left, the Muslim League and the Congress, and that too because these parties have never concealed their antipathy towards us.         
	By naming only three, Advani kept the doors open for post-poll arrangements with a plethora of parties in Indias political spectrum.         
	But unlike the Congress, which might be impelled to support a secular alternative to keep the BJP out, the BJP would not prop up anyone else if it failed to head an NDA government.         
	We are not interested in keeping anyone out. If we cannot make the government, let the Congress make it or help someone else do it, Advani candidly said.

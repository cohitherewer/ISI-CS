  - Sentence to be executed after HC seal        A STAFF REPORTER                                     
	Guwahati, Dec. 21: The Kamrup district and sessions court today awarded death penalty to the rapist and murderer of a three-year-old.         
	The accused, Sujit Biswas, now 23, had forced himself on the child, Seema Khatun, after luring her away from her elder sister Sultana, 9. The duo had gone pandal-hopping during Durga Puja in Paltan Bazar here on October 18, 2007.         
	The child was found lying in a drain inside a gunny bag near Nepali Mandir but died at the Guwahati Medical College and Hospital soon after.         
	Apart from telltale signs of rape, there were injury marks on the childs head and face. The accused had clubbed her to death in the most merciless manner in a bid to cover up his crime.         
	The death order was passed by additional district and sessions judge Mazed Ali after he found evidence against the accused cogent and the crime to be a rarest of rare cases, involving extreme cruelty.         
	Shocked by the depravity of the convict, the court rejected his plea for leniency.         
	However, the death sentence will not be executed till Gauhati High Court confirms it.         
	Additional public prosecutor Bhaskar Jyoti Dutta said the death sentence was pronounced after the accused was convicted under Sections 302 (murder) and 376 (rape) of the IPC.         
	The court found that the case falls in the rarest of rare category. The circumstantial evidence established the depraved acts of the accused and he was convicted and sentenced to death, Dutta said.         
	The accused, a petty criminal from Bongaigaon district, had committed the heinous crime under influence of alcohol.         
	The incident had sent shock waves among residents who turned their ire on the accused.         
	They gave him a thrashing before handing him over to police and demanded stern action against him.         
	The victim was the daughter of Sukur Ali, a rickshawpuller, and resident of Islampur locality here. Ali had told police that Seema had gone pandal-hopping with Sultana, when she went missing from a pandal in Paltan Bazar.         
	Sultana then rushed home to inform her parents. Ali, his wife and their neighbours rushed to the spot and started a search.         
	 Ironically, it was the accused who led them to the drain where the girl was lying unconscious. When asked how he came to know about it, he sensed the gravity of the situation and tried to escape but was caught and handed over to the police.         
	The police investigated the matter and found him guilty.        
	Two days before Seema was assaulted, a seven-year-old girl was also allegedly raped by a 25-year-old youth in the city.         
	On October 25, the girls father filed an FIR at Noonmati police station, accusing his neighbours son of raping his daughter.

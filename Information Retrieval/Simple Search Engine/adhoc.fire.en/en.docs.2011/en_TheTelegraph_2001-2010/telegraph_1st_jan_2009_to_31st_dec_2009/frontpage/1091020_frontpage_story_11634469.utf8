	London, Oct. 19: A large clump of Elvis Presleys hair, believed to have been cut from his head when he joined the army, has sold for 11,300 at an auction of memorabilia collected by a devoted fan.        
	More than 150 items that had belonged to the former president of the Elvis Presley fan club went on the block at Chicagos Leslie Hindman auctioneers.        
	The most expensive items included a red ultrasuede shirt worn by Presley, which was sold for $34,000, and a monogrammed cream-coloured shirt that sold for $62,000, according to the auction houses listing of post-auction sale prices.        
	 Two concert-worn scarves sold for a combined $2,318. A set of concert-used handkerchiefs went for $732.        
	Presleys personal collection of single song mini-records, known as 45 rpms, sold for $3,904.        
	Wedding and bridal shower photos of Elvis and wife Priscilla sold for nearly $6,000. Personal letters from Presleys relatives were also among the items auctioned, including a collection of letters from his estranged grandfather J.D. Presley.              
	The auction house did not provide details about the buyers.        
	All the items had belonged to the late Gary Pepper, who ran the fan club and was a         
	friend of Presleys. Pepper, who had cerebral palsy, died in 1980.              THE DAILY TELEGRAPH

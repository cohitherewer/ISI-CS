	Ranchi, Dec. 31: Mahendra Singh Dhoni spent part of the years last day with police  discussing a Rs 50-lakh extortion threat from a man claiming to be an associate of the countrys most wanted gangster.        
	Police officers said the family of the Team India skipper had received two letters  one on Monday and another today  from a person who claimed he was a member of the Dawood Ibrahim gang.        
	Both the letters were written by hand by the same person who identified himself as Md Tasleem, SSP Sampat Meena said. We are taking all precautions and his security has been tightened.        
	Dhoni today met Meena and other officers. Police sources said the big-hitting wicket-keeper did not look worried.        
	The India captain smiled at waiting reporters as he emerged from the meeting before driving back home.        
	Jharkhand police spokesperson DIG S.N. Pradhan said the letters  sources said one threatened to blow up Dhonis house if he reported the threat  appeared to be an act of mischief by local criminals and ruled out the involvement of the Mumbai underworld.        
	The perceived threat from the underworld is for the moment ruled out, he said. There are two rival groups in the colony from where the letter originated. We believe this is some kind of mischief but would not like to underplay it.        
	Meena, too, said the letters  with names of many criminals who have been booked several times  appeared to have originated locally, not far from Shyamali Colony where Dhoni and his family live.        
	Extra commandos have been deployed around Dhonis home. An escort party will accompany the cricketer, whose security has been the subject of much speculation and comment ever since word spread that he was unhappy with the way his Z-category protection was being handled by the police here.        
	Dhonis house has been cordoned off and all visitors, including friends, are being checked.

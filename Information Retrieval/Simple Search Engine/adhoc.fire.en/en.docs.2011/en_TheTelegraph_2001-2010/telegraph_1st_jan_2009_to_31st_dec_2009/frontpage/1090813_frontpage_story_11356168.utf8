The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Effect of shutdown limited in flu fight 
                                                                                                           Effect of shutdown limited in flu fight 
          G.S. MUDUR                              
	New Delhi, Aug. 12: Mumbai has closed schools for a week and movie halls for three days to check the spread of swine flu, prompting experts to caution that such shutdowns might help temporarily slow down the rise in the number of infected people but would not stop expansion of the pandemic.        
	Public health experts said the closure might prevent testing centres and hospitals from being hobbled by burgeoning number of infections.        
	Indias count of infections rose to 1,193 today, among whom 17 patients have died.        
	The health ministry said Pune had detected 61 new patients infected with the pandemic H1N1 flu virus, all involving community transmission. In Mumbai, 24 patients tested positive for the infection today.        
	The shutdowns are mitigation measures to prevent the health system from being overwhelmed by patients, said Khanchit Limpakarnjanarat, regional adviser with the communicable diseases surveillance unit of the World Health Organisations regional office in New Delhi.        
	It is a non-pharmaceutical intervention to put a brake on the numbers, Limpakarnjanarat told The Telegraph. He said the decision of when to call for shutdowns is usually taken by local authorities, depending on the rate at which the highly infectious H1N1 virus is spreading and the strain on health resources.        
	A public health specialist said the spread of the virus depended a lot on human behaviour  something that authorities seek to control through shutdowns or advisories to avoid crowded places.        
	But we cant always influence the way people behave, the specialist said. When there is high adherence to hand hygiene and when persons with flu symptoms stay home, the chances of community spread get reduced.        
	But infectious disease experts said shutdowns only had a temporary effect on the rise in local numbers. The virus continues to spread whenever it gets a chance  it is likely to continue to enter India through people infected abroad and it is likely to continue circulating from person to person in areas where community transmission has been established.         
	The virus may re-enter communities through such routes. The shutdowns, experts point out, are more likely to be ordered in countries or communities with high population density where it is easier for the virus to spread.

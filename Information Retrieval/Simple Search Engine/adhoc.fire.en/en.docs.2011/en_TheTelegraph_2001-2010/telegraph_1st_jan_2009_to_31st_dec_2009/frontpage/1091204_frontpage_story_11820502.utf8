	London, Dec. 3: A man only has to look at a womans feet to tell if she is head over heels in love with him, according to a study.        
	While men have long assumed that a womans blushes or a bat of the eyelids were the telltale signs of attraction, experts now believe that foot movements reveal most about an admirers true feelings. It is claimed that gestures with our feet are the most powerful form of body language because we are less conscious of what we are doing with them.         
	If a woman moves her feet away from her body while giggling, to adopt a more open-legged stance, then she is attracted to you. But if her legs are crossed or tucked under her body, then the suitors advances are likely to end in disaster.         
	Women will be disappointed to learn that the rules do not apply to men, who reveal nothing about sexual attraction through their feet, the research discovered.        
	However, unfaithful men should remain on their toes  women can tell a liar by spotting a man who keeps his feet unnaturally still. The findings were made by Prof. Geoff Beattie, one of Britains leading psychologists, who examined how people move their feet in response to situations.         
	Beattie said: Whilst people might know what their facial expression or hands might be imparting, they will often have no idea whether their feet are moving or the messages their feet are sending out.        
	People can mask smiles, or mask what they are doing with their eyes, but feet are actually a bit easier to read because people dont know what they are doing with them.        
	The secret language of feet can reveal a great deal about our personality, what we think of the person were talking to and even our emotional and psychological state, they are a fascinating channel of non-verbal communication.        
	He added: If you are meeting someone for the first time, laughter is not necessarily a good thing  people can be laughing at you, or with you. If a womans feet move when she laughs, it is one of the most powerful signals that she likes you.

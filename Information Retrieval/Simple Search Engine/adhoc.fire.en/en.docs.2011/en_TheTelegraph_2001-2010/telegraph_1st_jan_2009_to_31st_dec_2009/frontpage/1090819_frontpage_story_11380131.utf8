The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | A tax meeting with eye on political dividend 
                                                                                                           A tax meeting with eye on political dividend 
          OUR BUREAU                            Dasgupta, Jaitley                          
	Aug. 18: Asim Dasgupta today called on Arun Jaitley ostensibly to discuss the sterile matter of goods and services tax but the visit re-established a point of contact that could come in handy at a time the CPM and the BJP are combating a common enemy called the Congress.        
	The Bengal finance minister met Jaitley in the official capacity as chairman of a committee tasked to oversee transition to a new sales tax regime. Jaitley is a former commerce minister but BJP sources said he met Dasgupta today because L.K. Advani and other leaders such as Sushma Swaraj had already left for Shimla for a key meeting beginning tomorrow.        
	However, sources from both sides would not say why the tax meeting was scheduled today  that too at Jaitleys home, not at his office  when the date for the BJPs chintan baithak was known in advance. The tax is scheduled to be introduced in April 2010.         
	Neither would they discuss the heretical suggestion of an undeclared thaw between the BJP and the CPM, confining themselves to the refrain that Dasgupta wanted Jaitleys help to remove misgivings of the BJP-ruled states about the new tax regime.        
	Not that Jaitley is a stranger to the CPM. Politburo member Brinda Karat had called on the lawyer-politician for legal advice on a corruption case against Pinarayi Vijayan, the Kerala CPM boss who has challenged in the Supreme Court the CBI move to prosecute him.        
	Both sides are expected to disclaim such discussions but the interaction was only one in a series since a stand-off set in between the first UPA government and the CPM over the Indo-US nuclear deal.        
	In the Lok Sabha elections, some candidates fielded by the BJP had ended up helping the CPM stem the extent of its rout in Bengal. Over and above the heavy erosion in seats, the CPM could have lost three more had the Opposition vote not been split by the presence of the BJP candidates.        
	Whispers abounded then that some of these candidates were allowed the use of the CPMs considerable resources in the state.        
	No one is speaking of an unthinkable alliance between the CPM and the BJP, a charge the Left levels against the Congress in Kerala. But little prevents the sworn enemies from cultivating contacts on either side and testing out floor-level co-ordination that can be made to look like a mere coincidence.        
	Any unpublicised rub-off effect of such understandings can only we welcomed by the CPM in Bengal as it battles the potent Trinamul-Congress assault on the Left Fronts three-decade reign.

  - Paramilitary forces to be reorganised in red zones          KUMUD JENAMANI                                     
	Jamshedpur, Oct. 8: The security top brass in Jharkhand has decided to re-deploy police and para-military forces to focus on Maoist hubs in Bundu, Tamar and Arki regions of Ranchi and Khunti districts that have seen an escalation in rebel violence, the latest being the abduction and execution of Special Branch inspector Francis Indwar.        
	According to a senior police officer, the need for reorganising the paramilitary forces was felt after a series of Maoist-sponsored incidents took place in Bundu, Arki and in Tamar where policemen and at least a dozen villagers, including women and children, have fallen to rebel bullets.        
	Though the decision to reorganize the forces had been taken earlier, the manner in which Indwar was abducted from a Khunti market, executed and his body dumped near NH-33, barely 12 km from the capital, is likely to have speeded up the implementation of the plan.        
	During the last 12 months, rebel hit-squads under the command of Maoist zonal chief Kundan Pahan have killed as many as seven policemen, including a deputy superintendent of police and an inspector.         
	S.N. Pradhan, the IG (provision) and police spokesperson, said they were now rethinking their strategy against Naxalites in view of the heightened rebel activity under Pahan. The reorganization of forces, he confirmed, was a part of the plan.        
	There are about 80 companies of paramilitary forces deployed across Naxalite infested districts. But, in view of heightened rebel activity in the Tamar-Bundu-Arki area, we will have decided to reorganise forces for optimal use, he said.         
	Pradhan said Pahans intention of perpetuating violence was designed to terrorise ordinary people and ruffle the administrative machinery.         
	That is why he was targeting ordinary villagers, too, he added.        
	He said the war against the rebels was on, and Ranchi and parts of Khunti district would be the focus areas, independent of the Centres plan of launching a massive anti-Naxalite operation across rebel hubs in various states, including Jharkhand and Chhattisgarh dubbed epicenters of Maoist terror by Union home minister P. Chidambaram.         
	According to police sources, four Maoist area commanders operated under Pahan who held sway over Gautamdhara, Dasham Falls, Chalkat and Chandil, the area known as Bundu-Chandil sub-zone.

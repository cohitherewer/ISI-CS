	Calcutta, Feb. 8: The Left Front kicked off its Lok Sabha poll campaign on the Brigade Parade Grounds today by trampling guidelines Calcutta High Court had laid down to save the patch of green.        
	Although Left Front chairman Biman Bose had given an undertaking to follow the directives, the violations started from early morning.         
	Several hundred buses and trucks were parked on Maidan and Left Front supporters got busy cooking meals after getting off the vehicles.         
	We come in the morning, cook our food and have it before the start of the meeting Thats the tradition in all Brigade rallies, said Benoy Hazra of Bolpur, a veteran of Brigade rallies, enjoying a lunch of rice, vegetables and fish and ignoring announcements over the public address system explaining the high court directives.         
	On September 28, 2007, the high court had passed an order banning chullahs within 3km of Victoria Memorial, besides disallowing parking of vehicles on Maidan.        
	Bose had said on Friday that he was obliged to follow the order and had issued a set of dos and donts for participants of the rally. In his first undertaking to the authorities as the chairman of the Left Front, Bose had also promised to restore Maidan to its original condition after the event.         
	The Telegraph found that chullahs were set up at 15-odd places. At least 30 to 40 groups cooked meals using LPG cylinders and stoves.         
	Around 300 buses are already parked here..., said a traffic sergeant.         
	Twenty-five tankers from the CMCs water supply department were parked near the podium. There is no court order on the CMC that bans supply of drinking water to Maidan, a corporation official said.         
	Some policemen tried to enforce the court directive by dousing the chullahs and seizing gas ovens, stoves and utensils but they faced stiff resistance. Over 100 people blocked the Red Road crossing for almost 15 minutes around 9.30am, demanding the return of the utensils.        
	Police said 12 people were arrested and seven gas cylinders and utensils seized from three spots for violating the court order.        
	Bose chose to be silent on the issue after the rally, but his party colleague Rabin Deb admitted to minor violations. We had received two specific complaints of cooking. They stopped cooking after we intervened, said Deb, adding that the venue would be cleaned up by tomorrow.         
	I have heard that the court directives were not followed. I will visit Maidan tomorrow and after inspection, I will inform the honourable court, said environment activist Subhas Dutta.         
	Dutta had moved the court last December after a DYFI rally damaged the grounds. A division bench of Justices Bhaskar Bhattacharya and R.N. Banerjee is scheduled to hear the case tomorrow.

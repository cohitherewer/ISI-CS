          SAMBIT SAHA                              
	Calcutta, Sept. 7: Singur or Gaffar?        
	Bengal today performed the last rites of not only the IT township but also of a vaunted alternative model: direct land purchase by private investors.        
	When the Singur model  government acquiring land and facilitating investment  ignited a political storm in Bengal, direct shopping by investors was touted as a solution.        
	But the can of worms prised open by the Vedic Village controversy and the fallout on the IT township have proved that the second option has far more pitfalls than the first.        
	If the Singur model was politically unpalatable, the Vedic model as personified by fugitives like Gaffar Mollah has thrown up unsavoury factors ranging from the illegal to the immoral.         
	There are few other alternatives, although a handful of companies have acquired land directly. But either the size of such land has been modest or it has been located in relatively less fertile areas  not a viable solution in a state here most of the land is cultivable.        
	All of which means that without some kind of a political consensus, Bengal cant bring in investment and create jobs.        
	A criticism that stuck on the Singur model was a clause in the land acquisition act that denied the aggrieved the right to legally challenge acquisition for a public purpose. The compensation could be challenged in a court but not the decision to acquire the land.        
	However, a clause that kicks in at the initial stage (Section 4-1) does allow people to take their grievances to the collector who can either reject them or accept them and inform the government. Only after this process is the non-contestable notification issued.         
	In Singur, when the acquisition process had begun, few had raised voices. In fact, several meetings called by the government were either skipped by the Opposition, or the participants emitted conciliatory tones that lulled the government into complacency.        
	Nandigram changed the wind. In fact, in Nandigram, the situation had spun out of control even before the due process had started.        
	But consensus can be self-defeating without transparency. In hindsight, the Singur process also appeared more transparent than the other model. In Rajarhat and adjoining areas, politicians from opposing camps became bedfellows to share the fruits of alleged forcible land acquisition.        
	It (direct land purchase) is not a workable solution at all. Leaving it to private buyers, you will always run the risk of misuse as was evident in the Vedic Village episode, Harsh K. Jha, Tata Metaliks MD, said. His company could not get enough land in Kharagpur to build a steel plant and decided to move to Karnataka.         
	In Singur, when the government increased the compensation by 50 per cent after protests, many were willing to accept it but the issue had become too politicised by then.        
	We must work on how to do better within the existing framework of law, Jha said.

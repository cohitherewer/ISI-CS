                                                                                                           Bitumen scam probe

	Ranchi, March 8: Continuing his war against corruption, Governor Syed Sibtey Razi today ordered a comprehensive probe by the vigilance department into the 2008 bitumen scam.        
	The governor has acted on a report from the auditor-general, who had detected misappropriation of Rs 38.46 crore in the form of fake bills to procure bitumen last year. The auditor-general had also recommended handing over of the probe to an independent agency.         
	Following the report, finance secretary Rajbala Verma and road construction secretary N.N. Sinha urged the governor to entrust the probe to the state vigilance department.         
	Sources said that the auditor-generals findings were based on a survey in 15 out of the 52 divisions of the road construction department only. So, the actual embezzlement could run up to Rs 100 crore in the entire state, sources said.        
	According to a Raj Bhavan spokesman, the governor has asked the vigilance bureau to bring into the probe ambit the accounts officers posted at various road divisions, besides the engineers, officers and staff of the road construction department. The accounts officers are supposed to be advisers to the executive engineers in the 52 divisions.        
	The probe could embarrass former chief ministers Madhu Koda and Shibu Soren who held the department as additional charge during their tenure. The auditor-general, in his report, had pointed out that Rs 38.46 crore had been paid against fake bills.        
	Ironically, the earlier probe call made by Verma and Sinha had been stalled by Soren. Sinha, transferred during his regime, was brought back after Presidents rule was imposed.

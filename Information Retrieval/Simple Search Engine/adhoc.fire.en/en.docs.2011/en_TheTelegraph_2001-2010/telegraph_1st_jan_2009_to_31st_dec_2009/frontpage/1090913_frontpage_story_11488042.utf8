          OUR BUREAU                            Bhattacharjee holds the rail as he climbs the steps to the Milon Mela stage. (Sanjoy Chattopadhyaya)                                  
	Calcutta/Siliguri, Sept. 12: Chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee, looking tired and walking slowly, returned to Calcutta today from north Bengal feeling fine and straightaway headed to a fairground for an inauguration.        
	Bhattacharjee had spent the past four days at a forest resthouse in Mongpong, about 30km from Siliguri, addressing a rally and holding a meeting but generally recovering from ill health.        
	Im now feeling fine; very good, he told reporters after inaugurating a textile fair at Milon Mela this afternoon. I spent a pleasant vacation.        
	Bhattacharjee, accompanied by wife Meera, drove to the venue from the airport after his flight from Bagdogra landed. Coughing occasionally during his brief speech, he did not mention the setbacks over Wipro and Infosys.        
	Instead, he said: Small and medium industry too employs lakhs of people; it isnt only the big ones that do so. The handicrafts and textile sectors too employ a large number of people.        
	He conveyed his good wishes, beforehand, for this festive season.        
	Earlier, the chief minister had mentioned, in an obvious reference to his breathing problems, that small-scale industries and tourism minister Manab Mukherjee had told him not to make a speech if he did not feel up to it.        
	Manab told me itll do even if I dont give a speech, Bhattacharjee said. But I have decided to do so, though I have just reached Calcutta and am not fully prepared.        
	He briefly visited a couple of stalls, preferring to travel the 50-odd yards from the podium in his car. He declined a request by Mukherjee to visit some stalls further up, saying: No, I wont go that far. He then left for home.        
	The chief minister had put off his return by two days because of breathing problems. Sources in his secretariat have said he suffers from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, a respiratory ailment common to smokers.        
	In Siliguri, urban development minister Asok Bhattacharya said: The chief minister had been feeling weak after a recent bout of fever and also had breathing problems. So he rested for a couple of days and, feeling better today, left for Calcutta.        
	A CPM state secretariat member said: Doctors had advised him (Bhattacharjee) a few days rest in the hills.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Dud-seat strife hits talks
                                                                                                           Dud-seat strife hits talks
  - Congress miffed over Trinamul offer of unwinnable slots          BARUN GHOSH AND RASHEED KIDWAI                            Mahua Moitra                                        
	Calcutta/New Delhi, March 4: Seat-sharing talks between the Congress and the Trinamul Congress have hit a roadblock over Mamata Banerjees offer of unwinnable seats to the prospective ally.        
	Although Mamatas allotment of seats is not final, the current offer makes it a bad start for the talks and has ruffled the Congresss feathers.        
	Among the seats that have been kept away from the Congress are Nadias Krishnagar from which the party is keen to field Mahua Moitra, a former vice-president of financial services firm JP Morgan and now part of Rahul Gandhis youth brigade.        
	But Trinamul is reluctant to part with the seat, said to have been earmarked for actor Tapas Pal, on the ground that Krishnagar was not discussed during the initial rounds of parleys with the Congress.        
	Mahua has joined Rahuls Aam Aadmi Ke Sipahi brigade after chucking her job with placements in London and New York. These days, she is busy showcasing the UPAs pet initiatives such as the rural employment scheme and the right to information law in Krishnagar and neighbouring areas.        
	Three state Congress leaders  Subrata Mukherjee, Pradip Bhattacharya and Manas Bhuniya  registered their protest with the general secretary in charge of Bengal, K. Keshava Rao, when they called on him in New Delhi today.        
	Bengal Congress president Pranab Mukherjee is known to have taken the state party leaders complaint to Sonia Gandhi.        
	Mamatas offer to the Congress is a far cry from the list the latter had submitted to her last Sunday. In addition to six seats the Congress had won in the 2004 Lok Sabha elections, the seven seats Mamata has offered this time are Purulia, Bankura, Burdwan-Durgapur (new seat after delimitation), Jalpaiguri, Arambagh, Malda North (new seat) and Birbhum. The six seats under the Congresss control are Raiganj, Malda, Behrampore, Jangipur, Murshidabad and Darjeeling.        
	Congress sources said the leadership had submitted to Mamata a list of 18 seats, which included Krishnagar, Serampore, Diamond Harbour, Jadavpur and Calcutta North, in addition to the six seats it had won and the seven others Trinamul had offered. At least six of the seven seats Mamata has offered to the Congress are known to be Left bastions. Moreover, none of these seats is in south Bengal  the Trinamul stronghold that Mamata obviously wants to keep out of the Congresss reach.        
	We feel let down at the way Mamata has offered us unwinnable seats. Mamata should have offered at least a few seats where we have a fair chance of victory. All seven seats she has offered are traditionally Left bastions, PCC working president Subrata Mukherjee, a zealous advocate of the alliance, said.        
	Mukherjee is reportedly eyeing the Jadavpur seat, and Pradip Bhattacharya, another working president, the Serampore seat.        
	AICC in-charge Rao told The Telegraph this evening: I do not want to comment on a specific seat or a candidate but wish to reiterate that the alliance with Mamata Banerjee is on. There may be some teething problems but everything will be sorted out amicably.        
	One factor that favours a waiting game is time. The first date of withdrawal of nomination  till when bargaining can drag on, though it will affect campaigning  is more than a month away (April 13) and, for the last phase, it is on April 27.         
	State Congress leaders feel that Mamata is trying to make it a bad bargain for two reasons: One, she wants to keep winnable seats for her own party and keep the Congresss possible gains within limits.         
	Two, they feel Mamata is betraying her sense of insecurity so far as the alliance is concerned. Mamata is still doubtful whether Congress workers would really work to help her win the polls, said a state Congress leader.        
	Trinamul state president Subrata Bakshi echoed the Congress leader. We had forged an electoral alliance with the Congress for the 2001 Assembly polls. But the Congress did not work for us then.        
	The Congress leaders are unhappy at the way Mamata has floated names of her candidates even before negotiations enter a formal stage.        
	We may put up our candidates in some of the constituencies like Krishnagar and Jadavpurwhere Trinamul has suggested its own nominees like Tapas Pal and Kabir Suman. This is not expected when talks are on to firm up the alliance, said Abdul Mannan, a state Congress functionary.

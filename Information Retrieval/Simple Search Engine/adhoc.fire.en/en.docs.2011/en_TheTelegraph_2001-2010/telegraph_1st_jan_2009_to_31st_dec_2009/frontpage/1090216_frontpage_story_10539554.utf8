          A STAFF REPORTER                            Rescue workers at the site of the derailment near Jajpur on Sunday. (PTI)                                  
	Feb. 15: Railway authorities probing Friday nights fatal crash suspect a technical glitch in the engine of the Coromandel Express may have led to the accident after an inch-by-inch inspection of tracks in the area drew a blank.        
	A dummy run with a coal-laden goods train this morning put the tracks in the clear as investigators searched for clues and repair work continued through the night.        
	Railway safety commissioner Baldev Singh visited the spot on two days but couldnt pinpoint anything specific that might have triggered the derailment.         
	Instead, he asked senior railway officials to check the engine of the Chennai-bound train, which had 28 compartments.        
	At least nine persons were killed and over 100 injured after several compartments of the train, considered a lifeline for countless patients heading south for good and affordable treatment, derailed as it approached Orissas Jajpur Road station, 120km from Bhubaneswar.        
	Singh and A.K. Goyel, general manager, East Coast Railways, had been camping at the accident site since Friday night. But after 48 hours of investigation, they found nothing to show that the fault lay with the tracks or the signalling system. We have found nothing wrong with the tracks and there was no question of signalling error which could have triggered the incident, Goyel said.         
	As it was the engine that skidded off the tracks first, there is a distinct possibility that a technical snag developed in the engine. Examining the locomotive is a must-do task for us to ascertain the exact reason, a railway official added.        
	This morning, a goods train with 16 coal-laden wagons did a dummy run on the tracks between 9.15 and 9.35. A short while later, the Howrah-bound Falaknama Express rumbled down the tracks, the first passenger train to do so since the mishap. By 11, the tracks were declared functional.        
	We had set ourselves a deadline to get the tracks ready and functional within 60 hours. We have achieved it in a span of about 30 hours, Goyel said.         
	Railway authorities had engaged some 2,000 workers to restore services on both the up and down tracks. The workers toiled through the night to the pounding throb of 120 generator sets, used to light up the area.        
	Goyel ruled out the possibility of a technical snag in the crossover, a pair of switches that connects two parallel tracks, allowing a train on one track to cross over to the other. There was no crossover near the accident site. The closest one is over 500 metres away and it was functioning normally.        
	He said the technology used to manufacture the trains coaches had helped limit the toll to nine.        
	The coaches used in the Coromandel Express were non-telescopic in nature, he said. Instead of ramming into the coach in front on impact, as would happen earlier when the technology was not in place, the compartments now jump over the compartments in front or overturn, he explained.        
	A one-member probe commission headed by Singh has been set up. It will start investigations from Tuesday.        
	Normal service         
	South-bound trains have now started running on their normal route and there would be no cancellations tomorrow, South Eastern Railway officials said. On Sunday, the Howrah-Bhubanewsar Dhouli Express was cancelled. The Howrah-Chennai mail was also cancelled but in its place, a special train was run.

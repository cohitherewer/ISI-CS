	Ranchi, Feb. 1: The governors council of advisers, in its first meeting today, cleared the third supplementary budget as well as the annual budget estimate for 2009-10.        
	With the state under Presidents rule, the two money bills will be tabled in Parliament for approval once its session begins on February 12. Sources said the third supplementary budget of around Rs 800 crore comprises the provision of paying 40 per cent of the arrears of the salary under the 6th Pay Commission to state government employees.        
	Since the commission has not yet finalised the annual plan size of the state, the state is going for vote-on-account for three months in the next fiscal. Commission members are expected to meet governor and his advisers to finalise the plan size. Sources said that the government would pitch for an increase in the annual plan outlay for the year 2009-10 and fix it at Rs 9,000 crore  Rs 985 crore more than the current outlay.

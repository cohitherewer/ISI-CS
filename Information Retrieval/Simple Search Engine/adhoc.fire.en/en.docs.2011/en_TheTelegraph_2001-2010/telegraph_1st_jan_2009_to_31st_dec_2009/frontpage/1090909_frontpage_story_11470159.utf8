The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Politicians on suspects lips
                                                                                                           Politicians on suspects lips
          OUR BUREAU                              
	Calcutta, Sept. 8: Gaffar Mollah has named several politicians from the CPM and the Trinamul Congress with whom he shared a cosy relationship, a senior police officer said today.        
	During interrogation, Gaffar has revealed names of several local politicians in Bhangar and Rajarhat with whom he shared a cosy relationship, the officer said. The politicians belong to both the CPM as well as the Trinamul Congress.        
	This is a very sensitive issue with political overtones, the officer added. We have drawn up a list and this will be forwarded to the home secretary soon.         
	Wary of the eventual destination of the trail being etched by Gaffar, politicians appeared to be preparing to distance themselves from any possible link-ups.        
	Trinamul chief Mamata Banerjee, who had rushed to the partys local MLA Arabul Islam some days ago, today kept her options open. If Arabul is found to be involved in land deals in the Vedic Village-Rajarhat area, we will not spare him, she said.        
	Mamata also expelled three party activists, including a former MLA, for their alleged involvement in land deals in the area. Arabul, who made a brief appearance at the venue of Mamatas rally in Sikharpur near Vedic Village, was not allowed to get on the dais and left after a while.        
	The police are also keeping the Opposition on tenterhooks, saying today that Arabuls brother Sirajul Islam, alias Khude, is part of Gaffars gang. Gaffar told us today that Khude is one of the key members of his gang and had participated in the shooting after the football match on August 23, the North 24-Parganas superintendent of police, Rahul Srivastava, said.        
	The CPM is trying to frame Arabul, said Mamata. We dont want to have any relations with those involved in illegal activities. That is why we have expelled three party functionaries.        
	Those expelled are Tanmoy Mondal, the former Trinamul MLA from Rajarhat, Sukhen Chakraborty, councillor of the Rajarhat-Gopalpur municipality and Shankar Narayan Dutta, a former Trinamul councillor of the same municipality.        
	The three were expelled after a prolonged investigation, said Jyotipriya Mullick, a Trinamul MLA who headed the probe. All three have been found to have been involved in illegal land deals in the Rajarhat-New Town area.        
	Not that the CPM has nothing to hide. Gaffar was arrested early this morning in Bankura from the house of a former CPM gram panchayat member, Fazila Begum. The police said that even when Gaffar was absconding, he had kept in touch with politicians.        
	One of Gaffars brothers had earlier told The Telegraph that he used to brag that he had met CPM ministers like Manab Mukherjee and Abdur Rezzak Mollah at Vedic Village. Both ministers have denied any association with the land shark.

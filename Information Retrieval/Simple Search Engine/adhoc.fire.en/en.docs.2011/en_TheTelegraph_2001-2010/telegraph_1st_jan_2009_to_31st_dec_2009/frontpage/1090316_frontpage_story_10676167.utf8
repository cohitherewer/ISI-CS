The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Guffaw of a merry mutineer
                                                                                                           Guffaw of a merry mutineer
  - Back to an officer who dared bosses and missed a star           SUJAN DUTTA                             Binod Bihari Lal                                        
	New Delhi, March 15: That guffaw and hearty laughter on the telephone is at odds with the personality of Binod Bihari Lal, the man usually seen on duty in his khaki uniform with the single star on his epaulettes, equivalent to the rank of a brigadier in the Indian Army.        
	Lal may sound like a merry mutineer  this is the season of mutineering from Bangladesh to Madagascar  and there are faint echoes not to be missed here in India.        
	Lal laughs really loud in a telephone conversation. He is dialled two years after he hit the headlines for mutineering. He was in Nagpur then as he is in Nagpur today, when he should have been in New Delhi here, at the headquarters of the organisation he serves in the Seema Sadak Bhavan, as the additional director-general sporting two stars, equivalent to a major general.        
	The more cynical he gets, the louder the decibel level of his laughter.        
	He had dared the bosses, sticking to the letter of a government order issued in 2007, in the 150th year of the Sepoy Mutiny, and had asked his colleagues of the General Reserve Emergency Force (GREF) to follow suit. The GREF and the army make up the two cadres of the Border Roads Organisation (BRO), the militarys frontier road construction and maintenance force.        
	The upshot of Lals defiance of the army: the then director-general of the BRO, Lt Gen K.S. Rao, now retired, charged him with mutiny, and threatened to sack him. So Lal is still in Nagpur, heading Project Hirak as its chief engineer, serving in an office that is two notches below his station, supervising roads through Naxalite-influenced territory.        
	I had come to build roads in Naxalite land and help in the battle against the rebels, he laughs in the telephone from his office in Nagpur and the cynical laughter splits the ears in Delhi. It is a bit of a miracle that with my frustrations I havent given up my job.                          A Bangladesh Rifles trooper inside the forces Dhaka headquarters during the mutiny in February.

	Lal will not say a word beyond that because a job in the armed forces does not permit freedom of expression and he is not about to break the rules. The former judge advocate-general of the Indian Army, Maj Gen Neelendra Kumar, explains that according to the Army Act -- which applies to the BRO, the Assam Rifles and such other outfits officered by the army  collective insubordination amounts to mutiny.        
	The mutiny charge against Lal was withdrawn after the intervention of the minister of state for defence, Pallam Raju, but Lals career was tainted and he is yet to be given his promotion and new posting despite being consistently graded as outstanding and very good in performance reports. He was also posted to Afghanistan where the BRO last month completed a major road despite the Taliban threat but he was returned to India before time on medical grounds (he is diabetic).        
	Unlike the Bangladesh Rifles and the Bangladesh Army in the neighbouring country, India, where writer V.S. Naipaul found a million mutinies, the armed forces are seen as disciplined outfits with public exhibitions of protests and anger rare.        
	Yet, this month, for the second time, ex-servicemen are set to return gallantry awards to the President to protest against what they say are unfair pension benefits.        
	In the Assam Rifles, the paramilitary counter-insurgency outfit in the Northeast officered by the army and headed by a major general, the non-army soldiers frequently complain of inadequate rations and second-class treatment in comparison to colleagues in the army.        
	The biggest mutiny post-1947 was in 1984 after the killing of Indira Gandhi and Operation Bluestar when about 1,000 soldiers at the Sikh Regimental Centre at Ramgarh in Bihar rose in revolt and the unrest spread to Pune in the Southern Command, to Faridkot in the Western Command and to places in the Central Command. All the cases were disposed of.        
	Another protest shaped up after the fifth pay commission when technical officers of the Indian Air Force were angry with the recommendations but that was not called a mutiny. In the militarys Canteen Stores Department, too, the civilian employees went on strike demanding better pay and perks, but that, too, was not called a mutiny.        
	There may not be an exact parallel (to the Bangladesh Rifles mutiny) but there have been instances when the units, formations or establishments commanded by army officers saw resentment by the subordinates though such incidents are very very few, says former JAG Maj Gen Nilendra Kumar.        
	Unlike Bangladesh, where the border guard massacred the officers, Indias security establishment and its army has been able to manage dissent to a level where it does not lead to bloodshed and massacre. But individual incidents of fraggings -- soldiers killing superiors -- rose dramatically. There were 11 incidents of fragging in 2006 in which 23 soldiers, including officers, were killed.        
	Frustration, depression, prolonged deployment on counter-insurgency duty were among the reasons cited by the Defence Instances of Psychological Research as the causes.        
	In the rare case of Binod Bihari Lal, who is no longer the mutineer he was alleged to be, the merriment is the outcome of a debilitating cynicism with the establishment.

                                            Woods and Holmberg        
	Ocoee, Florida, Dec. 8 (Agencies): Emergency crews were summoned to Tiger Woodss Orlando-area mansion for the second time in less than two weeks today, this time because his mother-in-law was having stomach pains.        
	Barbro Holmberg, the mother of Woodss wife Elin Nordegren, was taken by ambulance to Health Central Hospital after someone called 911 about 2.35am, hospital spokesperson Dan Yates said.        
	She is stable and her condition is not serious, Yates said but could not be more specific because of privacy laws.        
	The hospitalisation came amid unconfirmed reports that Elin had reportedly moved out of the familys $2.6-million home in Windermere, Florida, where the worlds No. 1 golfer is understood to remain in seclusion after revelations of his extramarital trysts.        
	According to the celebrity website RadarOnline.com, Elin has moved into a house nearby as the couple, who have two young children, try to work on their marriage.        
	Holmberg, a politician and former minister who lives in Sweden, has been in the US since the weekend to support her daughter.        
	Health Central is the same hospital where Woods was treated after he crashed his sport utility vehicle outside his home in the gated Isleworth community in Windermere last month.        
	Yates said Holmberg was in a private room and the family had hired additional security to keep the media away. He said family members have visited, but would not say which ones. Shes in a wing that helps protect her privacy, Yates said.         
	Media attention has been focused on Woods since he hit a hydrant and a tree around 2.25am on November 27.        
	A police report on the crash released on Monday showed that a Florida trooper who suspected Woods was driving under the influence sought a subpoena for the golfers blood results from the hospital but prosecutors rejected the petition for insufficient information.        
	A witness told a trooper that Woods had been drinking alcohol earlier. The same witness also said Woods had been prescribed two drugs, the sleep aid Ambien and the painkiller Vicodin.

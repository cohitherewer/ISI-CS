The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | KKR sounds out Waugh for help to salvage team 
                                                                                                           KKR sounds out Waugh for help to salvage team 
          SAMYABRATA RAY GOSWAMI                            Waugh: Will he, wont he?                                  
	Mumbai, May 14: The Kolkata Knight Riders have approached Steve Waugh to help resuscitate the bruised team, according to sources.         
	The Australian cricket legend could not be reached for comment, but KKR sources said he was mulling over the offer and was yet to make up his mind.        
	A source in the Shah Rukh Khan-owned Calcutta IPL team, languishing at the bottom of the league standings in South Africa, confirmed that Waugh had been approached to replace cricket director John Buchanan after this season.        
	We touched base with him (Waugh) during his recent India visit. He will prove to be a great asset because of his exceptional cricketing abilities and long connection with Calcutta through his charitable project. He will be a good mascot, said the Knight Riders source.        
	Others, however, said the former Aussie skipper consistently maintained during his visit to Calcutta last week that he wouldnt like to get back to cricket in any form.         
	Jeet Banerjee, who heads Calcutta-based sports management company Gameplan which syndicates Waughs columns, said the former cricketer was too busy with his commitments.         
	How can he take up a coaching job? Where does he have the time? He has his charity, his business, said Banerjee, who is also associated with the Knight Riders.        
	But, the Knight Riders source maintained, Waugh, who has been a bit cagey about the T20 format in the past, has opened up to the game. He is certainly open to the idea, but his other commitments are weighing on his mind at this stage. Our negotiations are on, said the KKR source.        
	Waugh had earlier told The Telegraph that he wouldnt like to coach, but could be a mentor to players.        
	KKR, which was dubbed the Manchester United of the big-buck T20 league because of its brand value, has been wracked by controversies this year.        
	The Knight Riders source said changes in the team management were on the cards but Shah Rukh, the principal owner, would not do anything till the team left South Africa and a review, not driven by emotions, had been done.        
	SRK will not sack anybody or blame anyone for the teams fiasco in South Africa. But John (Buchanan) and his team of coaches are unlikely to be a part of IPL Season 3 when the league is back in India and KKR gets around to playing matches at Eden Gardens, said the source.        
	Its understood that as Buchanans replacement, Shah Rukh would look at somebody with an impeccable cricket record and also one who has gelled with India. Waugh fits the bill.         
	The Knight Riders source said Waugh was quite upbeat about the present KKR team composition despite its performance. He thinks the team can easily bounce back and thinks highly of both Dada (Sourav Ganguly) and (Brendon) McCullum, the source said.         
	Waugh had fought a bitter battle of nerves with Ganguly during his playing days. But during his Calcutta visit, he had backed his former rival and said KKR still needed Gangulys services.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Singh talks tough on terror   Militants urged to lay down arms 
                                                                                                           Singh talks tough on terror
   Militants urged to lay down arms 
  -Negotiations only way to peace, rebels told          ANUPAM BORDOLOI AND E.M. JOSE                                                
	Shillong, Jan. 3: Two days after the Guwahati serial blasts, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh today gave clear indications of hitting hard at the Northeast militant groups and also made it clear that negotiations would follow only after the outfits laid down arms.         
	Singh, who arrived here from Guwahati this morning, interacted with the media after inaugurating the 96th Indian Science Congress on the North Eastern Hill University (Nehu) campus. He returned to Delhi soon after.         
	Singh told reporters that the government would not compromise on terrorism and go to any extent to root out terrorism from the country.         
	The only course to achieve peace is laying down arms. We will never compromise with those who believe in the use of gun to get a solution to their real or imaginary problems. We will also not tolerate the use of force (by militants) to consider their demands, he said hours after getting a ground view of the security scenario in Guwahati.         
	The Prime Minister also made it clear that laying down arms must precede talks with even pro-peace groups. This could mean a delay in the start of parleys with some groups like Ulfas Alpha and Charlie companies, which have insisted on keeping their arms for self-defence even after announcing a unilateral ceasefire.         
	Commenting on Bangladesh, which has been harbouring militants from the Northeast, Singh said: We had brought to the notice of successive governments in Bangladesh the need to prevent militants of the Northeast from operating from its soil.        
	He hoped that the new government to be installed under the leadership of Sheikh Hasina would take appropriate steps to contain militancy.         
	We are making a fresh appeal to Bangladesh not to allow its soil to be used by the Northeast militants to unleash terror in India, he added.        
	To a query on the initiatives to contain infiltration of militants and migrants from across the border, the Prime Minister admitted that the porous border was a cause for concern.         
	Illegal infiltration from Bangladesh is going on through the porous border and border fencing work needs to be accelerated, he said, adding that the issue would be discussed in a cabinet committee meeting in Delhi next week.         
	Going beyond militancy, the Prime Minister said his government had taken a special interest to accelerate development in the Northeast so that peace could be achieved in the region.         
	He said the DoNER ministry had taken several steps to improve social services in the region.         
	At the same time, he admitted there were regional imbalances in the Northeast that needed to be addressed.         
	The Northeast still needs special attention in terms of development of road network, improvement of other infrastructure facilities and generation of electricity since the region had great power potential, he added.         
	Replying to a query on inter-state border problems in the Northeast, Singh left it to the states to resolve the matter.         
	He said the state governments in the Northeast should mutually try to solve the problems arising out of border disputes.         
	Assam has border disputes with Meghalaya, Nagaland and Arunachal Pradesh.

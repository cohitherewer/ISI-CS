          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Ranchi, Dec. 14: A Maoist landmine killed two members of a district police escort team at Kenranga Ghati, 100km from the capital, in Lohardaga this morning.         
	Superintendent of police Subodh Prasad said havildar Gopichand Mahto (24) and constable Harakh Mahto (24) were part of a motorbike squad that was on its way to Peshrar Ghati, 35km from Lohardaga, to bring back four companies of central paramilitary forces that were on election duty. While Gopichand was a resident of Chandankiyari in Bokaro, Harakh Mahto was a native of Silli in Ranchi.         
	Sources said 18 district police personnel on nine two-wheelers set out for Peshrar, located at a height of 300ft, from Lohardaga town. They reached Kenranga, 25km from Lohardaga police headquarters and flanked by dense forests, around 8.45am. While six motorbikes crossed the mud track safely, the one Gopichand and Harakh were riding was caught in a mine trap.        
	The two were on the seventh bike. The impact of the blast was so severe that mutilated body parts littered an area of some 600 square metres, said a local resident.         
	A senior police officer said a strategic distance of 50m between the motorbikes saved the others. He said the district police jawans were part of a road opening party (ROP). Their duty is to clear the road for movement of CRPF, Jharkhand Jaguar and Jharkhand Armed Police personnel.         
	Prasad said 40 guerrillas, armed with semi-automatic weapons, launched a second attack on the policemen soon after the explosion.         
	The gun battle lasted for 45 minutes, but no casualty was reported from either side. Sources said the Maoist squad was led by zonal commander Nakul Yadav.         
	Police have detained four persons for questioning while 10 companies of security forces have started a search operation in the area, which is dotted by several remote villages like Jambarwad, Banjari, Rorad and Chandlagi.        
	In another incident in the evening, the driver of a private bus and his helper sustained injuries as Maoists triggered a second landmine, this time at Rorad, 12km from Kenranga.         
	The SP said the attack was mounted around 5pm when the bus, which had taken CRPF personnel to Peshrar Ghati, was on its way back to Lohardaga. Fortunately, all the jawans were airlifted after the morning blast.

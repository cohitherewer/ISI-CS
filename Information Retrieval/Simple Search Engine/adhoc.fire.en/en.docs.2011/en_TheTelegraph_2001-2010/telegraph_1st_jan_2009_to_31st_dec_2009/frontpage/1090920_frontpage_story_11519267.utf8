          SATISH NANDGAONKAR                            Kalawati                                  
	Mumbai, Sept. 19: The Vidarbha farmers widow whom Rahul Gandhi had brought under the national spotlight during the July 2008 trust-motion debate in Parliament will be running against the Congress in the Maharashtra polls.        
	Kalawati Bhandurkar, 48, had sent Rahul bhau (brother) a rakhi in September last year; this October she will be taking votes away from his party.        
	She is the common candidate for the Shetkari Sanghatana and the Vidarbha Jan Andolan Samiti (VJAS), who have been highlighting the plight of Vidarbhas debt-ridden farmers. Analysts said she could split the Congresss votes in its former stronghold of Wani, which it lost to the Shiv Sena in 2004 after farmer suicides turned the tide against the ruling party.        
	In Parliament, Rahul had justified the Indo-US nuclear deal by saying energy security would improve the future of women like Kalawati, who was struggling to feed her family of nine after her husband committed suicide in December 2005. The Amethi MP had visited Vidarbha just before the Lok Sabha debate.        
	After Rahul Gandhis visit, widows and farmers have been coming to me and asking me to help solve their problems. So I decided I would contest the election and highlight the regions problems, Kalawati told The Telegraph from Yavatmal.        
	The cotton crop does not fetch sufficient price. Healthcare and education of children are big problems.        
	Kalawati had gained from Rahuls Parliament speech, where he also mentioned Shashikala Ringne, a Vidarbha day labourer struggling with her husband to educate her three children.        
	Both women received help from the NGO Sulabh International, which opened fixed deposits of Rs 30 lakh in their names that bring them Rs 3 lakh in yearly interest.        
	I have built a pucca house with a proper bathroom at a cost of Rs 2 lakh, Kalawati said. My children are getting good education. I plan to get two of my daughters married in the next two years.        
	She had travelled to Delhi earlier this year to meet Rahul but he was away.         
	Political sources said Kalawatis candidature could make farmer suicides an emotive issue in the polls but doubted if she could win.

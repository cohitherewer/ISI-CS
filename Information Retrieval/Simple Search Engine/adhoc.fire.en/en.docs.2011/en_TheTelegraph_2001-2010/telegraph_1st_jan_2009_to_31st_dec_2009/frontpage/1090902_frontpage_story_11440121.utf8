	Calcutta, Sept. 1: Ratan Tata today said he was ready to return the Singur land for the sake of Bengals development, but for a price.        
	We will hand the land back, but we left behind a fair bit of investment on the land. Obviously, we would like to be compensated for (the investment), he said in the afternoon after meeting industries minister Nirupam Sen.        
	About Rs 500-crore worth of investment is now locked in Singur, from where Tata Motors relocated the Nano project to Sanand in Gujarat, but neither Tata nor Sen disclosed any amount.        
	The Tata Group chairman, who had arrived here last night to attend the Tata Tea annual general meeting (AGM) this morning, said his group did not have any investment plan on the Singur land at present.        
	Any project that helps the state and makes sense to us, we will look into. But our intention is not to stand in the way of any development that takes place in the state and that may happen to take place on our land, he said.        
	Tata added that he would be keen to help the state and extend any co-operation to the Bengal government.        
	Sen, however, clarified that there was no investment proposal before the government now. He said the cancellation of the lease agreement could be discussed when any concrete investment proposal came up.        
	We will amicably settle all issues, he said, reaffirming that industry would come up on the Singur land.        
	At a media briefing with Sen, Tata did not directly comment on Mamata Banerjees proposal for using the Singur land for a railway wagon-manufacturing factory.        
	At the AGM in the morning he had been more forthright, saying: But it is not her land.        
	Half an hour after Tata had left the city, Mamata landed at Calcutta airport. She declined comment on Tatas statement.        
	Tata said the group was not moving out of the state. Bengal continues to be in our heart, he said at the AGM, drawing applause from shareholders. He said the Tata cancer hospital at Rajarhat would be ready by March 2010, and that 50 per cent of the beds would be free.        
	Later in the day, he said: There has been allusion to the fact that Tata (moved) out of Bengal because of what happened in Singur. That various projects would be aborted. But that is not so. I want to assure it is not so. We are here.

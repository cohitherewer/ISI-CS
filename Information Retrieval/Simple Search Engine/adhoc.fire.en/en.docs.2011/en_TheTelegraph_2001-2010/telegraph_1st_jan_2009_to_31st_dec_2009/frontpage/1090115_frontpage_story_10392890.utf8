The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Maytas: one head, 23 tentacles
                                                                                                           Maytas: one head, 23 tentacles
          G.S. RADHAKRISHNA                                        
	Hyderabad, Jan. 14: Relatives of B. Ramalinga Raju had floated 23 companies under the Maytas banner which had branched out into a wide range of businesses.         
	Sources in Sebi and the state CID, which are probing the Satyam fraud, said the companies had interest in mineral resources, housing, solar power, SEZs, consulting and ferro industries, among other businesses. But the majority of them are in real estate, with names such as Maytas Orange County Pvt Ltd, Maytas Hill County Pvt Ltd, Maytas Buildtech Pvt Ltd and Maytas Developers Pvt Ltd.         
	Thus far, many people had been aware of only two Maytas companies: Infra and Properties.         
	Sources said the CID had set up special teams to investigate the 23 companies  their balance sheets, income tax returns, projects, bids and bank statements. The sources said the focus of the investigators would be on finding out if any of these companies were used to divert Satyam funds into other areas, chiefly real estate.         
	Market sources said though the Satyam promoters had floated the Maytas banner two decades ago, only the Infra and Properties companies had become active. It was only three years ago that the remaining entities were registered and made operational.         
	Company law experts said corporate swindlers intending to siphon off funds often floated several smaller companies in a bid to bypass scrutiny of legal and regulatory agencies.         
	Money is usually funnelled through a web of companies to mask the identity of the real beneficiaries, dodge taxes and make it harder for regulators to follow the cash trail.         
	Such a complex network can also be used to increase a promoters share in a company without drawing attention.         
	Concerned over the Satyam episode, the Andhra Pradesh government is reviewing its mega-projects handed to Maytas: Hyderabad Metro, Machilipatnam port and irrigation packages worth Rs 13,000 crore. Chief minister YSR Reddy has directed the chief secretary to review the status of all government projects undertaken by Maytas.         
	In his report submitted to Reddy on Monday, chief secretary Ramakant Reddy had suggested a review of whether the joint partners of Maytas could execute the projects and, if not, hand them over to the second-best bidder.         
	A spokesman said the government had more or less decided to hand over most Maytas projects to either the next majority partner in the existing consortium or to the second best consortium which bid for the Hyderabad Metro and Machilipatnam projects.        
	Sebi complaint: The Sebi has filed a complaint with the director-general of police over the delay in allowing its team to question Ramalinga Raju. Sebi counsel Pradyumna Kumar Reddy said they could not record Rajus statement because the police had already arrested the Satyam chief.

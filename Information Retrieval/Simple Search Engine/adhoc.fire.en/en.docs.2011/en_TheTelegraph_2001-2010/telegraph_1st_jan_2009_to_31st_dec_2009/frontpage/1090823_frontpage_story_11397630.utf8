	Fans wearing 3D glasses clapped as soon as James Camerons face appeared on screen. The filmmaker, shown in 3D, invited moviegoers to enjoy a 16-minute peek of his anticipated sci-fi epic Avatar, which was screened for free around the world yesterday.        
	The footage takes viewers to the planet Pandora, where an ex-Marine (actor Sam Worthington) is among a group of humans who have their brains linked to cloned versions of a native species in order to safely explore the spectacular environment. Sigourney Weaver plays a botanist overseeing the exploration. She, too, embodies an avatar based on the tall, lithe, tailed, blue humanoid species that populates the planet.        
	Together they meet an enormous hammerhead dinosaur with a plume of multicoloured spikes on its face and the snarling tiger-like creature that scares it away.        
	Another scene shows Worthingtons character befriending a native woman (Zoe Saldana). They discover a psychedelic forest of luminescent flowers and battle an army of flying dragons. Relying on 3D and performance-capture technology Cameron has helped pioneer, Avatar is an immersive blend of animation and live-action movie magic. Fans at an Imax screening in Los Angeles were overwhelmed by the 3D footage. It was almost a sensory overload, said Ryan Moore, 23, a student at Ohio State University. You have to be in the moment wearing the (3D) glasses to really appreciate it.         
	Dwayne Smith of Venice was taken with the digital effects. It looked very real, especially the aliens. It looked amazingly real, said the 45-year-old. It was one of the most amazing things Ive ever seen, actually.        
	The free preview convinced one fan to buy a ticket on the spot. I think its going to be one of the greatest movies this decade, said 21-year-old film student Derek Nunn.        
	The screenings, shown on some 440 screens in 58 countries, kept social networking sites abuzz with fan feedback.One who was disappointed with the trailer said seeing the extended footage in 3D changed his mind about the movie. It is essential that you watch it in Imax-3D, or 3D, Manoj Patel of Manchester, England, wrote on the films Facebook page. I just got back from watching the 15-minute footage, and Ive got to say, my mouth was wide open all the way through.

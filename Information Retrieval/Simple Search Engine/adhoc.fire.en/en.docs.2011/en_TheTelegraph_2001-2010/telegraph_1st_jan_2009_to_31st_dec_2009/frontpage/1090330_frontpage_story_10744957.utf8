          OUR CORRESPONDENT                                    
	Shillong, March 29: After the Meghalaya Progressive Alliance staked claim to form the government with support of 28 MLAs last night, the Congress-led Meghalaya United Alliance today said it had 31 legislators.         
	I can send the letter by fax to the governor claiming majority even today, Congress Legislator Party leader D.D. Lapang told The Telegraph over phone from New Delhi.         
	Lapang said while the MPA claims to have 28 members, excluding the Speaker, the MUA has 31, including the four legislators who had deserted the MPA.         
	Even on March 17, after the MPAs trust vote, we had met the governor and staked claim to form the government. We are ready to stake claim again, Lapang said.         
	He said till Speaker Bindo Lanong issues the final disqualification order of the four MLAs who had deserted the MPA, they are still the members of the Assembly and are supporting the MUA.         
	Lapang, however, admitted that HSPDP legislator Adviser Pariong, who was with the MUA, is now in the MPA fold.         
	On the Meghalaya Speakers decision not to accept the membership and voting rights of four legislators who had deserted the MPA, Lapang said: If the Speaker continues to maintain this stand, he may evoke contempt of court.         
	The MPA, on the other hand, is keen on proving its majority in the Assembly, now that Pariong joining back in its MPA fold and the Supreme Court allowing the Speaker to complete the disqualification process against four other legislators.         
	The House has been in suspended animation after the imposition of Presidents rule.        
	On March 17, the MPA proved the majority in the House after it secured the casting vote of the Speaker, following a tie of 27 each for both the ruling and the Opposition.         
	Last night the MPA, after a rally to protest against Presidents rule, submitted a memorandum to Governor R.S. Mooshahary saying it is staking claim to form the government since it had a majority.         
	We will also meet the governor staking claim to form the government, MPA secretary Conrad Sangma said today.         
	The MPA submitted the names of the MLAs supporting the alliance along with the memorandum sent to governor last night.        
	The memorandum included the names of 14 NCP legislators, excluding Sanbor Shullai who has deserted the MPA, nine UDP members excluding the Speaker, two HSPDP legislators, including Pariong, one BJP and two Independents.                                       
	With the Assembly Speaker ready to complete the task of final disqualification of four legislators, Paul Lyngdoh (KHNAM), Sanbor Shullai (NCP), Ismail Marak and Limison Sangma (Independents), the strength of the Assembly will stand reduced to 56 from the original 60.         
	As it stands now, the MPA has 28 members excluding the Speaker, while the MUA has 27 members, without the four suspended legislators.        
	In the memorandum submitted to the governor, the MPA said, We already had majority and in fact have proved the same on the floor of the House on March 17. However, without prejudice, we would like to prove the same again on the floor of the House.         
	The MPA also said more than reasonable opportunity had been given to the Congress-led coalition in the past to form the government in the state.         
	The memorandum said: In such circumstances, you would not be justified in calling any Congress-led coalition to form the government. Any such action will send a wrong signal to the public that the high office of your Excellency is a partial one and keen and desperate to install a Congress-led coalition in power ahead of the parliamentary elections.

  - Repeat attempt by unstable lady, Benedict unhurt                                                    Amateur video footage shows the faint image of the womans hand grabbing the Popes vestments. (AP)      
	Rome, Dec. 25: An unstable woman jumped the barriers in St Peters Basilica and knocked Pope Benedict XVI to the floor as he walked down the main aisle to begin Christmas Eve Mass.        
	The Pope quickly got back on his feet and celebrated Mass before thousands of the faithful, showing no sign of strain and urging them in his homily to become truly vigilant people.        
	But the breach in security  the same woman had tried to leap over a barricade to reach the Pope at last years Christmas Mass  again raised the question of how the pontiff can be protected while still having close contact with people.        
	Susanna Maiolo, 25, an Italian-Swiss national, shocked the Catholic world and Vatican security when she lunged at the 82-year-old Benedict, grabbed his vestments and caused him to fall to the marble floor.        
	The Pope, flanked by security men and bishops, was walking up the main aisle of the basilica to start a Christmas Eve Mass when the incident took place.        
	Members of the congregation screamed as Maiolo, wearing a red, hooded sweatshirt, jumped the barriers and lunged at him.        
	French Cardinal Roger Etchegaray, 87, who has been in frail health recently, fell to the floor in the confusion and was taken away in a wheelchair.         
	He suffered a broken femur and will have to undergo surgery but is not in serious condition.        
	The Vatican said Maiolo was psychologically unstable and unarmed and the Pope was not hurt in any way. She was taken to an Italian hospital for psychological treatment.        
	The incident at St Peters was the second high-profile security breach in Italy this month.        
	Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi spent several days in hospital after a man with mental problems struck him in the face with a statuette of the Milan cathedral, breaking his nose and two teeth, at a campaign rally in Milan.        
	During Christmas Eve Mass, the Pope celebrated the ritual without further incident. For the first time in recent memory, however, Christmas Eve Mass began at 10pm instead of midnight, in what the Vatican said was an effort to help Benedict preserve his strength for his intense schedule over the Christmas season.        
	Benedict is said to be in generally good health, but last summer he broke his wrist in a fall at the house in northern Italy where he was spending his summer vacation.        
	The Vatican acknowledged that Maiolo had also tried to jump a barricade to reach the Pope last year.        
	Its surprising that it happened inside St Peters, because the security there has changed a great deal in recent years and is much more tight than it used to be, the Archbishop of Westminster, Vincent Nichols, leader of Catholics in England and Wales, told the BBC. But there it is, Im sure those arrangements will be reviewed and greater care will be taken, he said.        
	There have been few security breaches in Benedicts pontificate, which began in 2005. In 2007, a German man jumped over a barricade in St Peters Square as the Popes jeep was passing during a general audience and tried to board the vehicle.        
	The most serious attack on a Pope in the Vatican was in 1981 when Turkish gunman Mehmet Ali Agca shot and nearly killed Pope John Paul II in St Peters Square.        
	While visitors to the basilica must pass through metal detectors and spot checks, security once they get inside is relatively light. Vatican security is shared by a police force and Swiss Guards.        
	Vatican spokesperson Father Federico Lombardi said it was impossible to provide watertight security for the Pope because being close to people was part of his mission.        
	It is impossible to prevent every possibility of something happening, even at close range, Lombardi told reporters. The Pope wants to have a direct, pastoral relationship with people where you can touch children, shake hands and do what you want to do and what the people want you to do, Lombardi said.        
	If you want watertight security, you cant do that. Being out of touch with people, being far from them, runs against the spirit of his mission so there will always be a risk, he said.        
	In his homily to more than 10,000 people inside Christendoms largest church, the Pope urged the faithful to rediscover the simplicity of the nativity message.        
	He recounted the traditional Christmas story of Christs birth in a manger in Bethlehem and urged Catholics to put aside the complexities and burdens of daily life and rediscover the path to God.        
	We live our lives by philosophies, amid worldly affairs and occupations that totally absorb us and are a great distance from the manger, he said.        
	In all kinds of ways, God has to prod us and reach out to us again and again, so that we can manage to escape from the muddle of our thoughts and activities and discover the way that leads to him, he said.        
	On Friday, in his Urbi et Orbi (to the city and the world) message, the Pope said todays world had to rediscover the simplicity of the Christmas message. People should abandon every logic of violence and vengeance and engage with renewed vigour and generosity in the process which leads to peaceful coexistence.        
	He said that while the world was currently steeped in a grave financial crisis, it was also affected even more by a moral crisis, and by the painful wounds of wars and conflicts.

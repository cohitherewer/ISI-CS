	Ranchi, Oct. 6: A Jharkhand police inspector abducted by Maoists from a bustling marketplace was found beheaded this morning, the brutality underscoring the perils of ill-equipped intelligence-gathering.        
	Official sources said special branch officer Francis Indwar, who worked in the intelligence wing of the state police, was the 339th policeman to have been killed by Maoist rebels since 2003.        
	The 50-year-old is survived by his wife Sunita, 45, and three sons, Animesh, 14, Amitesh, 12, and Abhisekh, 10, and leaves behind at least eight other dependants, including two sisters and a widowed sister-in-law.        
	The grisly murder comes at a time the Centre is preparing for an offensive against the Maoists in several states, including Jharkhand and Chhattisgarh, dubbed the epicentre of Left extremism.        
	In Delhi, Union home minister P. Chidambaram condemned the cold-blooded beheading.        
	If the Naxals have any demand they should place their demand. But cold-blooded murder is simply not acceptable. I condemn it, he said, reacting to reports that the rebels wanted to swap arrested Maoist leader Khobad Ghandy with the inspector.        
	Indwars body was found around 9.15 this morning from a bridge in Khunti, about 12km from state capital Ranchi. Police sources said a poster beside the body read: Inspector Indwar ko maut ki saja  Maovadi (death sentence for inspector Indwar  Maoists).                          Indwar      
	Jharkhand police chief V.D. Ram said the Maoists had killed Indwar to avenge the encounter deaths of two cadres last December. The poster found by our officers from the spot suggests that Maoists had taken the action to take revenge for the killing of their friends, Motiram Munda and Ghasi Ram Munda, the director-general said.        
	Ram and Ranchi SP Praveen Kumar both denied that the rebels had communicated with the police regarding the release of Indwar, who was on duty at a Khunti market when six rebels dragged him away in full view of the public nearly a week ago.        
	Indwars body was first taken to Rajendra Institute of Medical Sciences but angry colleagues didnt allow doctors to carry out an autopsy.         
	The special branch officers, who blamed their seniors for Indwars death, held a demonstration at the hospital before taking the body to the state police headquarters.        
	We are plainclothesmen scouring the Red bastion for information. Our men are not provided with arms because that leaves Maoists with a chance to loot weapons after killing them, said special branch inspector-general Bibhuti Bhushan Pradhan.        
	Sources said being a special branch officer was more a punishment than prestige. Drawn from the police force, most of these personnel are unarmed. Only those assigned to protect VIPs carry arms.        
	IG Pradhan said manual gathering of information in rural pockets  most of them dominated by Maoists  should be stopped and sleuths must be allowed to depend on intercepted calls.         
	The Special Branch Police Association demanded security in remote pockets. We want escorts from local police stations, ideally the officer-in-charge himself. Else, we will return to the headquarters en masse, said Ramsarek Rai, an inspector and the associations president.        
	At the police headquarters, Indwars sister Biromika blamed the police for his death. You people are responsible for my brothers death. You gave us false assurances and did nothing to rescue my brother, she sobbed.        
	Governor K. Sankaranarayanan announced a compensation package for Indwars family, including an ex-gratia of Rs 10 lakh, Rs 11.50 lakh as insurance cover and the officers basic salary and allowances for the remaining years of his service. Education will be free for his three sons till they graduate.

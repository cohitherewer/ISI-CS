  - Oath once more, minus Bible amp; multitude           MICHAEL D. SHEAR                              Obama retakes the oath from Chief Justice Roberts on Wednesday; (below) Obama grins during the stumble on Tuesday as wife Michelle looks on				                                       
	Washington, Jan. 22: In golf, they call it a mulligan. A do-over.        
	Theres no formal name for what President Barack Obama and Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr did on Wednesday evening.        
	The chief justice re-administered the oath to Obama, one day after the two men stumbled over each others words during the inauguration ceremony.        
	After flubbing his one role on Inauguration Day  administering the oath of office to Obama  Roberts travelled to the White House to re-administer the oath.        
	Just to make sure.        
	We decided it was so much fun Obama joked while sitting on a couch in the Map Room of the White House.        
	Obama stood and walked over to make small talk with pool reporters as Roberts donned his black robe.        
	Are you ready to take the oath? Roberts asked.        
	I am, and were going to do it very slowly, Obama replied.        
	After a flawless recitation that included no Bible and took 25 seconds, Roberts smiled and said, Congratulations, again.        
	Obama said: Thank you, sir. Then added: All right. The bad news for the (reporters) is theres 12 more balls.        
	A President is required by the Constitution to say I do solemnly swear that I will faithfully execute the office of President of the United States, and will to the best of my ability, preserve, protect and defend the Constitution of the United States.        
	At the inauguration, Roberts instead said that I will execute the office of President to the United States faithfully.        
	Only hours after aides told reporters there was no reason to administer the oath again, they concluded it was easier to do it on the first day, rather than have someone challenge the legitimacy of his presidency.         
	In a statement, White House counsel Greg Craig said the oath was re-administered out of an abundance of caution.         
	We believe that the oath of office was administered effectively and that the President was sworn in appropriately yesterday. But the oath appears in the Constitution itself, Craigs statement said.        
	Two Presidents -- Calvin Coolidge and Chester A. Arthur -- have retaken the oath because of unusual circumstances the first time round.        
	While about two million people were on hand to watch Obamas first swearing-in -- a figure that does not include the hundreds of millions who watched it on television in the US and around the world -- only nine people witnessed the do-over. Four aides, four reporters and a White House photographer were present on Wednesday evening.        
	The event was not announced until it was completed successfully.        
	The Map Room ceremony was less grand than the original one in front of the throng on the Mall.        
	But it was certainly warmer.                    LAT-WP AND NYTNS

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Buddha offers to step down   Wary of domino effect, Karat tries to dissuade CM; debacle blows lid off party rift
                                                                                                           Buddha offers to step down     -  Wary of domino effect, Karat tries to dissuade CM; debacle blows lid off party rift
          ASHIS CHAKRABARTI                                                      Bhattacharjee		    
	Calcutta, May 17: Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee is believed to have offered to quit, triggering a crisis for the CPM leadership both in Bengal and New Delhi and laying bare the rift in two major camps in the party.         
	Till late on Sunday evening, the chief minister stuck to his position, despite requests from the party chief, Prakash Karat, to reconsider it, according to sources close to both. No official confirmation was, however, immediately available either from the two or from any other senior party leader.        
	Karat cannot let Bhattacharjee go, it was said, because that would mean the party boss, too, would have to go.         
	Bhattacharjees offer to resign capped a series of dramatic developments within the party following its humiliating defeat in the Lok Sabha polls in Bengal. He had offered to quit earlier, admitting responsibility for the police firing in Nandigram and was persuaded to stay on as chief minister.        
	But it is a different story this time  primarily about the battle within.         
	The first sign came yesterday evening when CPM sources in Bengal disclosed that the chief minister would not attend Mondays politburo meeting in New Delhi. The official reason given to the media said Bhattacharjee decided to stay back in Calcutta in view of post-poll clashes between political parties in different parts of the state.         
	Soon afterwards, however, other reasons came to be assigned to his decision to stay away from the politburo meeting. It was suggested that his decision to skip it was aimed at avoiding the heat from his detractors.         
	Party insiders suggested a third reason that was directly related to the battles within the party  his absence from the politburo meeting was seen as a protest against Karat raj.         
	But the cloud over the party tussle had started gathering in Calcutta within hours of the declaration of the final election results for Bengal. Knives were said to have been out with the two camps within the party blaming each other for the partys debacle in Bengal and Kerala.                   Karat       
	It was not immediately known who fired the first shot. But the script goes like this. Nirupam Sen, commerce and industries minister and politburo member, blamed primarily the state party leadership for the poll debacle.         
	Since Sen is known to be a Karat acolyte, his charge prompted Biman Bose, state CPM chief, to mount a counter-charge. It is not the state party, but Karat who is responsible. Nobody said that openly, but Boses comment to the media on Sunday on the failure of the call for a third front was enough indication of the blame game.         
	Boses comment inspired references to Somnath Chatterjees call for Karats resignation yesterday. It is no secret that Chatterjee enjoys the confidence of Jyoti Basu and the two have similar views on Karats stand on many issues, including that on the partys relationship with the Congress.         
	It is also no coincidence that Bhattacharjee had made it known, in a poll-eve interview with STAR Ananda, that he was trying in his own way to have Chatterjee readmitted into the party. Karat and his loyalists in the politburo are known to have a tougher position on the issue.         
	But the post-poll blame game within the party is actually the continuation of an episode that unfolded weeks before the CPM decided to withdraw its support from the UPA government over the civilian nuclear deal between India and the US.         
	The so-called Delhi line, led by Karat, insisted that the withdrawal of its support to the Manmohan Singh government was an ideological compulsion for the CPM. It hoped that the Congress would be weaker in the next polls, thereby making the third front a reality. The line had all the trappings of approvals by the central committee, the politburo and the last party congress, but it was essentially a Karat script.         
	Karat and his group argue that imperialism is a greater threat to the country and hence their opposition to the nuclear deal and the Congress.        
	The other group in the party thinks the threat to secularism is greater than that of imperialism. It is in favour of a pro-Congress line since the Congress is the biggest secular force in the country.         
	Leaders of the Bengal line were always suspicious of the wisdom of Karats ideological brinkmanship. The party had little option but to object to the nuclear deal, they said, but they were opposed to the party taking the extreme step of withdrawing support to the government.         
	The poll debacle has proved that their worries were not off the mark. The anti-Karat leaders in Bengal now argue that the partys withdrawal of support to the government made it easy for the Congress and Mamata Banerjee to strike the alliance in Bengal.        
	Had the CPM continued its support to the UPA government, Mamata would have found it impossible to tie up with the Congress and would probably have been pushed back to her old alliance with the BJP, thereby helping the anti-Left vote to split.         
	With the Congress no longer needing the Left in New Delhi and the Congress-Trinamul Congress alliance set to last at least until the next Assembly polls in Bengal, the CPMs old debate on relations with the Congress makes little sense to others.         
	To defeated and humiliated party leaders and groups, though, it is time to reopen old wounds and settle scores.

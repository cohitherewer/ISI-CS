	New Delhi, Dec. 8: Indias lead negotiator Shyam Saran is returning to New Delhi to update Prime Minister Manmohan Singh about the deliberations in Copenhagen.        
	Saran, the Prime Ministers special envoy on climate change, will return to Delhi on Thursday to brief Singh about the flavour of the negotiations. He will travel back to Copenhagen along with the Prime Minister. Singh is scheduled to attend the final leg of the climate change conference.        
	A former member of Indias climate change negotiating team said he could not explain Sarans return to New Delhi. I would consider this extraordinary  I dont recall such a thing in the recent past, the former negotiator told The Telegraph. But I wouldnt want to speculate on the reasons, he said.         
	Differences between some negotiators and the government had spilled out into the open after environment minister Jairam Rameshs statement in Parliament last week. Ramesh, who will be in Copenhagen on Friday, would lead the Indian delegation at the high-level segment that starts next Monday.

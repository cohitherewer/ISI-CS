The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | State power pangs: MoUs 31, MW zero
                                                                                                           State power pangs: MoUs 31, MW zero

	Ranchi, July 13: Thirty-one MoUs for power plants have been inked between the state and investors in the past six years, but not a single megawatt (MW) of electricity could be added to this power-crunch state.        
	For, in most of the cases a little development has taken place on ground for these MoUs aimed to make Jharkhand a power-surplus state exporting electricity to other states. The proposed capacity for these plants would be anywhere around 40,000MW, 25 per cent of which would be for use of state enough to end existing power woes and also to meet manifold increase in consumption by rural Jharkhand if all 32,000 villages got electrified by 2010-11 under the Rajiv Gandhi Gramin Vidyutikaran Yojana.        
	Out of 31 prospective investors, six of them  Calcutta Electric Supply Company (CESC), Adhunik Energy, Jindal Steel and Power Ltd (JSPL), Essar Ltd, Gagan Sponge Iron, Corporate Power Limited (CPL)  have already been allotted coal blocks and the companies are either through or are in different stages of getting mandatory clearances like that of environmental, pollution among others.        
	We could not start ground execution of our 1,000MW capacity project in Santhal Pargana. We require only about 328 acres of raiyati land and villagers have agreed to part with their plots, said Sanjeev Sengupta, a senior CESC official looking after the Jharkhand project.        
	CESC was allotted Mahuagiri coal block in Dumka and the proposed site at Aamgachia-Kathikund villages would not displace a single family.         
	Same is the fate with JSPL, which has been allotted coal blocks at Jitpur (Godda) and Amarkonda (Dumka) for its proposed power plant sites at Sundarpahari and Shikaripara villages, respectively. JSPL assistant vice-president Avijit Ghosh could say that they had applied for the land depositing over Rs 10 crore.        
	State energy department sources said that if all the MoUs were turned into reality, Jharkhand would produce 40,690MW.        
	The government has also apparently thrown up its hands on land acquisition as a Union government communiqu suggested direct purchase of about 70 per cent of the land by investors. Moreover, notification of a rehabilitation and resettlement policy is awaited from the Centre so that the state can imitate the same so as to avoid any controversy.        
	Only CPL has been able to make headway in its proposed 1,200MW power plant with an expected investment of about Rs 5,000 crore. The company has been allotted Chittarpur coal block with 100MT expected deposit. We are in a position to start producing electricity by 2011, said Rajnish Paroha, general manager (administration) of CPL.         
	R.C. Prasad, the technical adviser to energy secretary N.N. Pandey said that land was the only problem for companies who want bigger stretches. However, he maintained the state was serious to implement power MoUs.        
	Many a company has also approached the governors office to expedite land acquisition process, but so far nothing has been done. In the wake of the villagers protest in certain places against the projects that may displace them, deputy commissioners concerned do not want to burn their hand by taking bold steps.

                                                                                                           Delhi rider in bail for Shiney 
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Mumbai, Oct. 1: Actor Shiney Ahuja, accused of raping his maid, managed to get bail from Bombay High Court today but will have to go back to his hometown Delhi and stay there for the next three months.        
	Shiney, 36, has been in Mumbais Arthur Road Jail since June 15, his bail plea denied twice by the sessions court.        
	A bad back and a guarantee of Rs 50,000 got the actor his temporary freedom.        
	Justice A.P. Deshpande, who granted the bail in five minutes after the court convened, today has barred Shiney from staying in Mumbai.        
	He will also have to deposit his passport at the police station nearest to his residence and report there regularly, said his lawyer Shrikant Shivade.        
	Shiney may want to catch the Betaab Dil Ki Tamanna Hai, which begins with a reconstruction of the rape case. It goes on air next week.         
	Shineys lawyers, who had been trying for bail for the last couple of days, said: We pointed out to the judge that while the maid said in the FIR that she had been raped by Ahuja, she did not say so during interrogation before the magistrate. She used the word atyachar instead, which means torture and not rape.         
	The lack of medical proof of use of force helped Shiney.         
	Cellphone records have shown the maid, who claimed to have been locked up by Shiney in his bedroom between 3pm and 5pm on June 14, had been talking to her boyfriend.

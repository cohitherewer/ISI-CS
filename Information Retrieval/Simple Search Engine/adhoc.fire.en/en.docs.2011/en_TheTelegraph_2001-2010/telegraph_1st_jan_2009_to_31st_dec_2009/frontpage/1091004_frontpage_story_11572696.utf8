The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | This is your pilot scuffling with crew
                                                                                                           This is your pilot scuffling with crew

	New Delhi, Oct. 3: Air Indias international flight IC-884 was thousands of metres above Pakistan when, in the sleepy hours before dawn, a man strode into the cockpit and a scuffle broke out.        
	No, it wasnt a Pakistani hijacker. It was a steward jousting with the co-pilot for allegedly being rude to an airhostess.        
	Some sources claimed the co-pilot of the Sharjah-Delhi-Lucknow flight, Capt Ranbir Singh, had made disparaging comments about the young woman, and that steward Amit Khanna, apparently close to her, had decided to beat an apology out of him.        
	An Air India media release acknowledged a scuffle between a pilot and two cabin crew members, adding that both the pilots and the two cabin crew members involved had been de-rostered.        
	As there have been claims and counter claims (Air India) has ordered an enquiry, it said. The two young combatants were not available for comment.        
	Former Air India director R. Pathak said: We have never had such things in the past. This is shameful for all of us.        
	The mid-air fisticuffs, which began around 4.30am, continued for several minutes while the commander of the flight, Capt Aditya Chopra, tried to bring the duellers to their senses and manage the aircraft at the same time. Both young men reported minor injuries at the end of it all.        
	Airline pilots said a cockpit incident can easily lead to an accident and, therefore, even cabin crew need the pilots permission to enter the cockpit. A fight is a horror story in an aircraft carrying hundreds of passengers, a source said.        
	The duel in the air comes just after Indias national carrier had been involved in a battle on the ground with its executive pilots. Luckily for the Maharaja, IC-884 made it to Lucknow without further turbulence, after a brief halt in Delhi.        
	Jet snag        
	A technical snag caused by a hydraulic leak forced a Jet Airways Brussels-Mumbai flight to land in Budapest today. Flight 9W227, carrying 220 passengers, was an Airbus 330. All passengers are safe. The flight will take off tomorrow, a Jet source said.

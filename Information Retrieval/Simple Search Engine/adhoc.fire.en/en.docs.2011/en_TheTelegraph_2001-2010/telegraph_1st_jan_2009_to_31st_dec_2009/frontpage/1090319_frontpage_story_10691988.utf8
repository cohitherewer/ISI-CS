The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Colour of cold fear
                                                                                                           Colour of cold fear
                                            
	Another two-storeyed house on Pratapaditya Road bears testimony to the fear under which some residents live in what the chief minister occasionally prefers to call oasis of peace.        
	The 7ftx7ft wall is emblazoned with entreaties  in blue, yellow and red  seeking votes for Rabin Deb.         
	Behind the defaced fall lurks raw fear. So much so that a tenant who summoned courage to speak to The Telegraph chose to do so behind the cover of collapsible gates.        
	The lady said she did not know when the wall was painted over for the campaign exhortations. She is also not sure if the landlord, who does not live there, has given permission.        
	Even if such permission has been given, it has not been submitted to the police station  the rule requires filing the consent three days before the paint job.        
	I do not know when they came and wrote on the wall. I saw it while going to the market on Friday, said the lady.        
	How can you expect that permission will be sought to write graffiti? I dont want to say anything else. You come back later and speak to my husband, she said, adding that the owner of the house lived elsewhere.         
	She was angry at those who had defaced the wall but, more than that, she was scared.         
	We cannot go against the might of a political party, she said, explaining why the anger did not translate into a complaint with the Election Commission or the police.         
	But she has not lost faith in the poll watchdog. Although the lady did not wish to elaborate what she or the other tenants at the building had to say when a team from Tollygunge police station visited them a few days ago, she did not hide her expectation of action against the violators.         
	Something like this has happened for the first time and we are sure that the Election Commission will take action against the violators, she said.

	Jamshedpur, March 6: Turning its sights on the young minds of India, the BJP today vowed to change the face of the country through the use of Internet technology.        
	Kicking off the partys poll campaign in Jharkhand, the BJPs prime ministerial candidate, L.K. Advani, advised young voters to come forward and make the best use of their voting rights in the coming Lok Sabha elections.        
	Introducing the partys candidates from Jharkhand, the senior BJP leader pointed out that almost all of them were young and would fulfil the aspirations of the new generation.         
	Among those who were present with him at todays rally at Aam Bagan Ground in Sakchi were Arjun Munda (Jamshedpur), Bal Kunwar Gagrai (Chaibasa), P.N. Singh (Dhanbad), Ram Tahal Chowdhary (Ranchi), Sunil Soren (Dumka) and Sudarshan Bhagat (Lohardaga).        
	The younger generation should weigh all options before voting for a particular candidate. It is important to look into the records of a party before taking a decision, said Advani. He said that BJP would stress on the three issues of sushashan (good governance), vikas (development) and suraksha (security) and promised to change the face of the country using latest technological innovations, particularly the Internet.        
	Stressing on IT, Advani maintained that it had the power to end all development, corruption and communication related glitches. I can clearly see that the use of IT would change the face of country and we are ready to do it.        
	Claiming the UPA government had failed to provide security to the people, he said: Security of life, safeguarding the countrys borders and employment are the biggest challenges confronting us.         
	In a direct attack on the UPA government at the Centre, Advani claimed that inflation was the biggest issue till 2007. However, in 2008 unemployment emerged as the biggest challenge.         
	When the UPA government came to power in 2004, it claimed that the government is for the aam aadmi (common people). However, the same common people were neglected during that governments tenure, he pointed out.         
	Criticising the decision-making capabilities of the UPA, Advani called upon voters to elect a government that was capable of taking just decisions. The UPA government had failed to take a decision to hang Afzal Guru, who has been convicted for the attack on Parliament. This was because of its inability to take prompt decisions.

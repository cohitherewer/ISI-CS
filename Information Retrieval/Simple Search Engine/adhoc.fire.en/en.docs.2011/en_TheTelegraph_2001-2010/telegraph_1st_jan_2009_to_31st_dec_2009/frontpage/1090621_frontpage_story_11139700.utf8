  - Dheeraj, Hemant elevation to upper House boosts govt formation moves          SUDHIR KUMAR MISHRA                                           
	Ranchi, June 20: UPA partners Congress and the JMM today wrested two Rajya Sabha seats from the NDA, thereby giving fresh impetus to their moves to form an alternative government in Jharkhand now under presidents rule for exactly six months.        
	While the Congresss Dheeraj Sahu defeated the BJPs Anup Agrawal by 18 votes, the JMMs Hemant Soren beat former BJP MP Ajay Maroo by eight votes.        
	In Sahus election, necessitated after BJPs Yashwant Sinha vacated his Rajya Sabha seat on becoming Hazaribagh Lok Sabha MP, one vote  apparently that of JD(U) MLA Kheeru Mahtos  was declared invalid. While Sahu got 44 votes, Agrawal bagged 26 votes.         
	Hemant got 38 votes against Maroos 30. Three votes were declared invalid sources said apart from Mahtos, two RJD votes were treated as null and void. Hemant, who won the upper House seat vacated by Digvijay Singh of JD(U) after he became Lok Sabha MP from Banka, did, however, face a revolt by RJD members.         
	But RJD chief Lalu Prasad intervened in time and saved the day for Shibu Sorens son and the UPA.        
	We had decided that our legislators would reveal their papers before putting them in the ballot boxes. But, Sarath MLA Uday Shankar Singh and Manika MLA Ram Chandra Singh didnt do so in Hemants case. I informed my party president, who advised me to lodge a complaint with the returning officer, said state RJD chief Gautam Sagar Rana.         
	He added that disciplinary action would be taken against those who defied the party.         
	State JD(U) chief Jaleshwar Mahto said they had decided to vote for the BJP candidates. But, how one of our votes was declared invalid needs to be examined, he added.         
	CPI-ML (Liberation) MLA Vinod Kumar Singh and Forward Bloc MLA Aparna Sengupta did not cast their votes, but their abstentions did not affect the UPAs prospects.        
	Emboldened by the smooth victory of UPA nominees, Congress and JMM MLAs were planning to leave for New Delhi to impress upon central leaders to help them form an alternative government in the state.        
	Our aim will be to ensure that all legislators reach Delhi latest by Monday evening. The central leaders are ready to talk to us, said former deputy chief minister and senior JMM leader Sudhir Mahto.

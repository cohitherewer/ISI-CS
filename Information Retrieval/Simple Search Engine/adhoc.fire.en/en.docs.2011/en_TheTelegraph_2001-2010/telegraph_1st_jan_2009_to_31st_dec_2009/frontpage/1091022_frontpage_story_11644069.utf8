          OUR BUREAU                              
	Calcutta, Oct. 21: The Bengal government today tiptoed into the uncharted territory of handling a hostage situation, signalling willingness to talk with Maoists for the release of the young police officer kidnapped yesterday but remaining non-committal on the rebels demands.        
	Chief secretary Asok Mohan Chakrabarti said the government might go in for a dialogue with the Maoists to get Atindranath Dutta, the abducted Sankrail officer-in-charge, freed.         
	Late tonight, PTI quoted a West Midnapore official as saying the government would not oppose the bail plea of elderly tribal women in court tomorrow. The claim, which could help meet the Maoists key condition that arrested women be freed, could not be confirmed independently.        
	Earlier, the chief secretary said: If theres a definite proposal for talks, we have no problems having discussions with them (the Maoists). But it has to be understood that there are some demands in life which cannot be met. Any talks with them can be done by keeping this perspective in mind. But I must say that getting the OC released from Maoist hands is the governments top-most priority.        
	Maoist leader Kishanji tonight told STAR Ananda that he was ready to negotiate with the chief secretary. I am ready to speak to Asokbabu tomorrow. If the government agrees to our demand, we will release OC babu.        
	The Maoist leader said representatives of the administration were welcome to hold discussions at Dalilpur Chowk in Lalgarh with members of the Peoples Committee Against Police Atrocities. He added that the captured officer had written a letter which he would send to the TV channel tomorrow.        
	Earlier in the day, Kishanji had told Atindranaths father that his son was safe. His wife or father can meet him and even stay with him, he said.        
	Asked about the main condition of freeing the women, the chief secretary said: We must consider the greater interest of our people while considering whether to meet such a demand.        
	Chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee, too, conveyed as much to his party colleagues at a meeting at the CPM headquarters. He informed them that the government would not reject the Maoist demands right now as it would risk the life of the hostage.        
	Policemen have been abducted before but this is the first time an OC was snatched in the state and demands are being aired over television, evoking some parallels with the hijack crisis in Kandahar.        
	In view of the delicate situation, both the government and the party publicly pledged to give priority to the release of Dutta and two constables, Sabir Mollah and Kanchan Gorai, abducted earlier.        
	But state CPM secretary Biman Bose added that the government would have to take proper legal action against those charged with creating anarchy.        
	According to a home department official, three options are on the table.         
	One is to soft-pedal the operation of the joint forces in Lalgarh and adjoining areas. At the ground level, intelligence agencies will try to get in touch with people close to the kidnappers. As an unofficial concession, the government can go slow on the operation of joint forces, the official said, suggesting that the Maoists should not expect direct talks with the chief secretary.        
	The second strategy being discussed is to identify certain Maoist pockets in West Midnapore and Bankura and mount raids. The idea is to step up pressure through such raids. That could lead to the arrest of some second-rung Maoists, which in turn could force them to release the OC, the official added.        
	The third option is to send conflicting signals to the Maoists by blowing hot and cold. If the Maoists are confused, the may hesitate to take any drastic action against the OC, the official said.        
	According to this official, DGP Bhupinder Singhs assertion that there wouldnt be any let-up in the operation was proof of the government blowing hot.

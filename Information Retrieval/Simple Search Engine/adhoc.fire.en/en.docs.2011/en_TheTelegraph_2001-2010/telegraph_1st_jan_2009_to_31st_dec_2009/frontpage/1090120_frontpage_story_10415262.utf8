  - From towels to soaps to dustbins, ministry is brand-conscious          JAYANTH JACOB                                                    
	New Delhi, Jan. 19: Indian foreign policy lies messily entangled on many fronts, most worryingly in relations with Pakistan following the Mumbai terror attack, but our mandarins are not letting any of that affect punctilious housekeeping at home.        
	The external affairs ministry has floated tenders for miscellaneous items  115 in all  it requires to keep its precincts spick and span.        
	The list is a floor-to-ceiling furnishing and upkeep catalogue and includes everything from a variety of toiletry to dustbins to various kinds of bulbs, liquid insect repellents (Baygon) and acrylic and crystal glass ashtrays. Too bad, Mr Ramadoss, cant be impolite to foreign guests wishing a puff. Neither should we be inflicting on them our mosquitoes, thats bad manners.        
	Towels must be all Bombay Dyeing, nothing lesser will do, and they should come in three sizes  small, medium, large. And to complete the clean toilet experience, there must be plentiful stocks of Bengal Chemicals Phenyl, Wintex face tissues and toilet rolls of the same brand, white Lux soap and Dettol in liquid dispensers. Room fresheners should be Yardley, the agarbattis all Haridarshan.        
	Asked why the ministry was being such a stickler for brands, one official said: If you actually compare them with what else is available, these are not very expensive brands. And then, we are the foreign office, we should ensure that we maintain some standards for our guests.        
	The ministry has been careful enough to specify the brands even of spoons and forks (Venus) and door closers (Amar or Prabhat).         
	The bulbs the MEA prefers are Philips  CFL tubes, halogen bulb starlights, emergency lights and torches for those who work way beyond office hours in the service of the motherland.        
	Should they require to eat at work, doing extended duty, orders have been placed for electric kettles (Usha Lexus), hot-cases and food warmers, tea sets (bone china), service trays, Eagle thermos flasks, serving bowls, water jugs and glass tumblers.        
	There are also wall clocks (Ajanta), plastic glasses, two kinds of Surf detergent, brooms, dusters (white and yellow), liquid polish, table lamps, all manner and sizes of cells (Duracell), umbrellas, scrubbing brushes, insecticide, pumps et al.        
	When they step out of the workstations, our people in the foreign office know just how to keep the nations big secrets safe.         
	A slew of portable luggage has been put on the wanted list  Aristocrat Regency briefcases (LG CBL) VIP briefcases (BM BC XL), VIP Director expandable leather bags (with belt), lest anything slips out and puts national interests at risk.

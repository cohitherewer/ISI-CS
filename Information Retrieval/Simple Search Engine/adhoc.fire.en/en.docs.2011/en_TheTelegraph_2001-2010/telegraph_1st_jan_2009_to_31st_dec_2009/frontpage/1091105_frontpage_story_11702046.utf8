	London, Nov. 4: American actors Steve Martin and Alec Baldwin will co-host the 2010 Oscars, organisers have announced.        
	The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences said the two Hollywood veterans would share hosting duties at the 82nd Academy Awards ceremony.        
	Bill Mechanic and Adam Shankman, producers of the Oscars telecast, said the two actors were the perfect pair of hosts for the Oscars. Martin has hosted twice before, in 2001 and 2003, and has appeared as a presenter several times. Baldwin is a first-timer.

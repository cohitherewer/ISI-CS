  -Twin blows to militant outfit										      OUR BUREAU                                                          File picture of Jewel Gorlosa (left, in white) at one of his camps       
	June 4: Coordinated strikes by Assam police within and outside the state dealt twin blows to the rampaging Dima Halam Daogah (Jewel) with its chairman being arrested in Bangalore and its foreign secretary gunned down in Guwahati.        
	Assam director-general of police G.M. Srivastava today said DHD (J) chairman Jewel Gorlosa was arrested from Bangalore last night in a joint operation with the Karnataka police. Two others, including the outfits deputy commander-in-chief Partha Warisa, were also arrested.        
	Srivastava said the police had received information that Gorlosa had travelled from Kathmandu to Bangalore where he was trying to get a passport made in his name.         
	Deputy inspector-general of police, central western range, G.P. Singh, and some other officers were sent to the Karnataka capital where they have been camping for the last few days.         
	The three were arrested from different places they had rented, the DGP added.        
	Gorlosa and the other two are likely to be brought to Guwahati tomorrow after procuring transit remand from the court there.        
	In another incident in the wee hours today, the police gunned down the outfits foreign secretary Frankie Dimasa at Bishnu Nagar Hill behind Pratiksha Hospital in Guwahati.         
	The police said they cordoned off the entire area and launched a search operation after receiving information about the suspicious movement of an armed group of about four persons.         
	It was around 3am when the police team spotted some youths moving about in the area and asked them to stop for frisking. However, the militants did not pay heed and instead opened fire, forcing the policemen to retaliate, a police officer said.         
	One of the militants, who was wearing a red T-shirt and denim trousers, was killed in the brief encounter. A .32 bore pistol of Italian make was found on him. He was later identified as Frankie Dimasa.         
	The police said Dimasas associates managed to flee the spot and operations were on to apprehend them.         
	Search raids are being carried out in suspected militant hideouts but we have not been able to track them down so far, the officer said.         
	The encounter sparked panic in and around the area. I heard a few gunshots but did not venture out of my house for fear of being caught in the crossfire. Then I saw some policemen carrying a body but I had absolutely no idea about what was happening, Nayan Jyoti Sarma, a resident, said.         
	The twin developments come close on the heels of the arrival of a team of National Investigation Agency in Guwahati yesterday to probe the nexus between North Cachar Hills Autonomous District Council chief executive member Mohit Hojai and the DHD (J).         
	Continuing the success story, the police arrested two militants and a linkman from a house at Dakhin Gaon in Guwahati late on Wednesday night.         
	The police said they were in the city to attend a meeting convened by different insurgent groups of the region, including the Kuki Revolutionary Army (KRA), the United National Liberation Front (UNLF), the DHD (J) and Ulfa, to discuss joint procurement of arms and ammunition.        
	Those arrested have been identified as the KRAs self-styled defence secretary, Pao Mong, 40, a UNLF cadre, Wangkhai Manjom Samir alias Samir Singh, 28, and a KRA linkman, Thanglienzom alias John Kuki Gangte, 24.         
	Two of their colleagues managed to flee. Incriminating documents were recovered from the rebel hideout.        
	Even as the police turned up the heat on insurgents, the hill district continued to burn in ethnic conflict. Three houses were set on fire at Longmang village under Haflong police station around 1.30am today.

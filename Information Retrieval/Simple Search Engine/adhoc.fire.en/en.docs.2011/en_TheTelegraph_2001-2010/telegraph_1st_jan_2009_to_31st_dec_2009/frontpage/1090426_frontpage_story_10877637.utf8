          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Kokrajhar, April 25: The Bodo belt remained on the edge after yesterdays ambush by suspected NDFB rebels on a convoy of Bodoland Peoples Front leaders. The district administration has sought the armys help to maintain order in the volatile areas following clashes between BPF and Bodoland Peoples Progressive Front (BPPF) workers.        
	The clashes took place after the BPF leaders accused their rivals of masterminding the ambush.         
	Sources said army personnel were engaged to assist the police in the hunt for those involved in the ambush as well as in maintaining order in the vulnerable areas.         
	The army has been asked to carry out operations and maintain order. Search operation is on in the Tipkai area, the BTC inspector-general of police, A.K. Singh Casshyap, said.         
	Despite stepped-up security, a relative of a BPPF leader was killed last night and an All Bodo Students Union (Absu) leader injured in a face-off between BPF and BPPF workers at the Simbargaon weekly market here today, sparking off another round of tension and fear.         
	The sources said the attackers, after failing to find Bidhan Narzary, the organising secretary of Gossaigaon BPPF, at his Joynagar residence, killed his 18-year-old relative, Diju Brahma, instead.         
	In a separate incident, an Absu worker was assaulted by some unidentified youths at the Simbargaon weekly market. The market downed shutters after the incident, as the people present there panicked and ran helter-skelter. As tension mounted, most preferred to remain indoors and the town wore a deserted look.         
	The BPF took out a peace rally today in Kokrajhar and Chirang districts. The party later submitted a memorandum to the Kokrajhar deputy commissioner and returning officer Carol Narzary, demanding a high-level CBI inquiry into the incident and arrest of the NDFB men involved in the incident.         
	It also demanded arrests of the former Rajya Sabha MP and BPPF candidate from Kokrajhar, U.G. Brahma, and BPPF president Rabiram Narzary.                                 
	The sitting MP, Bwiswmuthiary and BTC chief, Hagrama Mohilary have accused Brahma and Narzary of instigating the NDFB to carry out the ambush.         
	However, both Brahma and Narzary condemned the incident and termed the allegation as baseless and an attempt to earn political mileage.

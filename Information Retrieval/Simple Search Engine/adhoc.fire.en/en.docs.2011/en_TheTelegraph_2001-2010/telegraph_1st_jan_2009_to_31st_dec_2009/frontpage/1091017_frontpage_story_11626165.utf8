          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                                    
	Calcutta, Oct. 16: Partha Chatterjee and three other Trinamul legislators today laid siege to chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjees office for nearly three hours, demanding his arrest.        
	On Mamata Banerjees orders, Chatterjee, the leader of the Opposition in the Assembly, Jyotipriya Mullick, Swarnakamal Saha and Ashok Deb stepped into Writers shortly after the chief minister left for lunch and started shouting slogans in the protected area.        
	The killer chief minister should be arrested. Trinamul men are being killed or arrested. Since he holds the home portfolio, he is the root of all trouble, Chatterjee said.        
	The immediate provocation, a repeat of Mamatas siege of Jyoti Basus office in 1992, was the arrest of two Trinamul supporters at Khanakul in Hooghly district after Anil Basu, a former MP of the CPM, threatened the police.         
	All four were later forced out of Writers by security personnel on the instructions of Bhattacharjee who returned to Writers at 4pm.         
	I cannot allow the corridors of Writers Buildings to be converted into the circus ground of an opposition party, Bhattacharjee said.        
	Mamata said Chatterjees protest against the partisan administration was justified as he was the leader of the Opposition and, therefore, the shadow chief minister.        
	Policemen on duty were taken by surprise at 1.30pm when the Trinamul MLAs pulled up chairs and sat down almost in front of the chief ministers office.         
	Shortly after 2, chief secretary Asok Mohan Chakrabarti walked up to the MLAs to greet them with a namaskar and invite them into his office. Chatterjee, who returned the greeting, said he would discuss with the other MLAs and get back to him.        
	After some time, Chatterjee thundered that there was nothing to discuss and that they would not end the sit-in unless the killer chief minister is put behind bars.        
	The chief secretary held a meeting with home secretary Ardhendu Sen who then asked the police to lock all the gates of Writers save the VIP entrance that is used by the chief minister and other dignitaries.        
	As this was being done, the crowd in front of the chief ministers office started swelling with more policemen assembling there. Questions about whether Bhattacharjee would return to the secretariat around four, as was his schedule, began doing the rounds.        
	By this time, crowds had gathered outside Writers as well as on its first and second floors.        
	Special additional commissioner of police (special task force) Rajeev Kumar, special commissioner R.K. Pachhnanda and deputy commissioner of police (detective department) Damayanti Sen reached Writers to oversee arrangements for ushering the chief minister safely into his office as the time for his return approached.        
	Policemen formed a human chain lining the corridor leading to the office. At the VIP entrance, around 50 policemen and officers stood guard as Bhattacharjees convoy entered at 4.        
	Bhattacharjee strode through the corridor, a strained smile on his face, and walked into his office as the Trinamul MLAs shouted, Arrest the killer chief minister.        
	On his instruction, security personnel asked the Trinamul MLAs to leave but, meeting with resistance, forced them out, bundled them into a jeep, arrested them and took them to the Presidency Correctional Home.         
	They were released after about an hour, by when Trinamul supporters had hit the citys streets.

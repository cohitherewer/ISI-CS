The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Blueprint ready for ATS debut in Bihar 
                                                                                                           Blueprint ready for ATS debut in Bihar 
  - Maharashtra model to overpower Maoists          NALIN VERMA                                    
	Patna, Sept. 2: Bihar is likely to become the fourth state to have its own anti-terrorist squad (ATS), the blueprint for which has already been prepared.        
	According to authoritative sources, inspector-general (operations) S.K. Bhardwajs office has prepared the blueprint and submitted it to the home department for approval and follow-up action.        
	Currently, only Maharashtra, Uttar Pradesh and Andhra Pradesh have anti-terrorist squads.        
	Sources said that the Bihar version of ATS had been modelled on the lines of the Maharashtra squad that played a vital role in the November 26 terror attack in Mumbai. The Bihar ATS will be armed with modern and latest weapon system after the home department approves it, said a senior official dealing with the new force.        
	The Bihar ATS  to be headed by an officer of inspector-general rank  will have two deputy inspectors-general and four superintendents of police, says the blueprint.         
	The ATS will have more than two dozen operational units within itself to deal with emergency situations. The squad will be raised from the existing personnel of Bihar Military Police and be specially trained to deal with sudden strikes.         
	The Bihar ATS will treat the outlawed Maoist guerrillas on a par with other terrorists.        
	There is a striking similarity between the operations and the motive of Maoist insurgents and terrorists. Security forces across the country have evidence to suggest that they co-ordinate among themselves in launching attack on the symbols of the state, a senior official, involved in preparing the blueprint process, said.        
	As of now, Bihar has a special task force (STF), which deals with cases of organised crime and Maoist-sponsored rebellion.        
	Additional director-general (police headquarters) Neelmani said that after the squad was set up, the STF would be left with the time and resources to exclusively deal with organised crime.         
	Of late, the state has been witnessing a string of Maoists attacks. The rebels, who in the 80s and 90s only targeted landlords, have also changed strategies. They are now striking at government establishments, including railway stations, community halls and police stations.        
	At present, Maoists are hyper-active in Jamui, Munger and Nawada in south Bihar and Sitamarhi, East and West Champaran and Sheohar districts in north Bihar.         
	Earlier, they had their operations limited in Jehanabad, Gaya, Aurangabad and Rohtas districts of central Bihar.         
	In response to escalated attacks on the railways, the government has already embarked onto the exercise to increase the number of security forces on long-distance trains on Patna-Mughalsarai, Patna-Gaya, Mughalsarai-Gaya and Jhajha-Jamalpur sections dotted with rebel presence in East Central Railway.

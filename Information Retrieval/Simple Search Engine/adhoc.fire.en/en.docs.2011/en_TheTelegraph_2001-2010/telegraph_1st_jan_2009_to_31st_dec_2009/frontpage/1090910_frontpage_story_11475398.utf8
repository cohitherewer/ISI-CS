The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Jet strike economics: lose some, save some
                                                                                                           Jet strike economics: lose some, save some
          JAYANTA ROY CHOWDHURY AND OUR BUREAU                      A woman shows her ticket for a Jet Airways flight at Chennai airport. (PTI)                          
	Sept. 9: Thousands of passengers are reeling from the Jet pilot strike but the airline could be bleeding less than on normal days because of the reduction in number of flights, analysts said.        
	Jet Airways made a loss of Rs 225 crore in the first quarter of 2009-2010 or about Rs 2.5 crore a day.         
	This does not mean that each day the airline does not operate, it cuts its loss by Rs 2.5 crore. When flights dont take off, revenue also goes down. Besides, the airline is operating more than half of its flights. On Wednesday, Jet flew 55 per cent of its planes.        
	However, when a plane is grounded, it leads to savings in fuel costs which account for 35 to 40 per cent of the daily expenses of an airline. The utility can also save on the salary of the cockpit crew staying away from work  another area of considerable expenditure.        
	Jet had spent Rs 637 crore on fuel in the first quarter (April-June) of this financial year. The figure is far lower than the Rs 1,539 crore the airline spent on fuel a year ago during the corresponding period largely because of the fall in global prices during the intervening months.        
	However, even at Rs 637 crore, the airline is spending on average Rs 7 crore a day on fuel  a part of which it can save when it is not operating all planes, as is the situation now.         
	Nobody wants a strike as it eats into an airlines brand equity. But sometimes, it can be a boon for a CFO (chief financial officer), said Sudipto Bose, a merchant banker.        
	But a Jet official said the loss as a result of pilots not turning up for work would be around Rs 14.7 crore a day. Bookings have fallen around 40 per cent, he added.        
	Today, over 170 flights, both domestic and overseas, were cancelled as 432 pilots, more than yesterdays number of 360, reported sick over sackings that followed the birth of the association National Aviators Guild. In Calcutta, seven out of 19 Jet flights were cancelled.        
	Bombay High Court has issued a contempt notice to the Jet pilots guild for continuing the agitation despite its restraining order yesterday.         
	Jet chairman Naresh Goyal said: The (the pilots) are behaving like terrorists.        
	The fire was returned in the same language. Sam Thomas, one of the Jet pilots sacked for allegedly joining the guild, told a TV channel: I think I have joined one of the best airlines in the world, Jet Airways, not the Taliban.        
	Unconfirmed reports said Goyal held talks with the pilots late this evening.

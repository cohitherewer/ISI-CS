The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | See no evil, smell no stink: Let the kids breathe poison, its poll time 
                                                                                                           See no evil, smell no stink: Let the kids breathe poison, its poll time 
          OUR BUREAU                                              
	Calcutta, March 17: Elections, the pride of India, have offered a fig leaf to cover Calcuttas shame: toxic air that millions breathe.        
	The Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee government today told the high court that police cant run after polluting auto-rickshaws because the force was needed for the smooth conduct of the election process.        
	Now that the elections have been declared and campaigns by political parties have started, the police are busy with the election process. So, they cant run after two-stroke autos and seize them. Similar is the case with phasing out old vehicles. This can only be done after the elections are over, advocate-general Balai Ray told the court on behalf of the government.                
	Ironically, within a few hours, the Bengal home secretary said the government could spare forces to protect the Indian Premier League, provided the cricket matches were held between April 11 and April 26 which means everything would be over before the Lok Sabha election starts in Bengal.        
	If the government eventually agrees to guard the IPL, it will mean it can find forces to facilitate a high-profile event but not to uphold a court order that had been issued last year.        
	An exasperated court then extended to July 31 the deadline for phasing out 15-year-old commercial vehicles from the Calcutta Metropolitan Area (CMA) and converting two-stroke auto-rickshaws within the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC) area to four-stroke vehicles.        
	In July last year, the court had directed the government to phase out the old vehicles from April 1, 2009, and to ban two-stroke autos from January 1.        
	The court virtually expressed its lack of confidence in the administrations ability to stick to orders  observations that would have made a law-abiding government squirm in shame.        
	It is unfortunate that the state government is not in a position to carry out the court orders in time. We still doubt whether the order will be carried out at all. But still we are providing them time, Chief Justice S.S. Nijjar said.        
	The two-judge bench of Justices Nijjar and Pinaki Chandra Ghosh asked a damning question. If Delhi, Bangalore and other cities can phase out the old vehicles, why cant Bengal?        
	Dont look for an answer to that question in the manifestos for the election the government and the political parties so revere.        
	The CPM manifesto has sought the removal of US nuclear weapons from Diego Garcia and  hold your breath  promised to undertake steps to control emission of greenhouse gases through energy-efficient technologies and effective regulation. But the government ruled by the party would not lift a finger to seize illegal autos.        
	Not that the party at the other end of the spectrum has clean hands. Mamata Banerjee, representing Calcutta South in the Lok Sabha and now running for re-election, was instrumental in derailing the half-hearted government attempt in January to implement the order.                
	Today, her partys Sovandeb Chattopadhyay, also the president of an auto operators union, said: If the new four-stroke auto stops functioning after two years, what will the poor auto operator do? Some other scheme has to be worked out for them.         
	The government has worked out a scheme for conversion but 17,000 auto-owners had filed incomplete applications  a possible ploy to avoid seizure during the initial days of the aborted crackdown.         
	Of the 17,000 applicants, only 102 owners had approached the transport department for rectifying the errors, Ray told the court today, adding that the rest should be made parties to the case. But the court refused, saying: It is the governments duty to deal with them.        
	Minutes after the hearing, environment activist and petitioner Subhas Dutta rushed back to the court and said some bus owners had heckled him. They have been threatening me with dire consequences for moving the case, Dutta said. The court asked Dutta to lodge a complaint with the ACP of the high court police station. Dutta was later escorted to his car by the police.

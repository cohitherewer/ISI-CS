The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | WAR-LIKE HUNT FOR YSR   Forces sweep forest tied to Maoists
                                                                                                           WAR-LIKE HUNT FOR YSR     Forces sweep forest tied to Maoists
          G.S. RADHAKRISHNA                                                    
	Hyderabad, Sept. 2: A helicopter carrying Andhra Pradesh chief minister Y.S. Rajasekhar Reddy disappeared over the Naxalite-dominated jungles of Nallamala an hour after lifting off around 8.35 this morning, prompting a search effort that resembled a military operation as the hours wore on.         
	The 60-year-old Congress leader, a devout Catholic considered close to 10 Janpath and known for his administrative and financial acumen, had left for Chittoor, around 600km from here, in a 10-year-old government Bell 430 helicopter. With him were principal secretary S. Subramanyam, chief security officer A.S.C. Wesley and two pilots, captains S.K. Bhatia and M.S. Reddy.         
	YSR, as the chief minister was known, was to have launched his ambitious rural programme called Rachha Banda (taking administration to the villages) in Chittoor.         
	The helicopter lost contact with the air traffic control at Begumpet  from where it had lifted off  and Shamshabad airports in Hyderabad around 9am and was in touch with Chennai radio control till 9.02am. At that time it was flying over Mahboobnagar and Kurnool, around 270km southwest of the state capital.         
	A copter ride from Hyderabad to Chittoor usually takes around two hours.         
	A statement issued by the Andhra Pradesh Aviation Corporation Limited, which operates the Bell, said the chopper was equipped with an Emergency Locator Transmitter (ELT) which would have activated in case of any crash landing. A Dornier 228 air force aircraft, which can pick up ELT frequency transmission, did not get any, sparking hope that the Bell may have landed at an inaccessible location.         
	Chief secretary P. Ramakanth Reddy said as much. So far we have not been able to make any contact. It is possible, because of strong winds and inclement weather, it may have landed in an unfamiliar area from where getting out can be difficult, he said.        
	What he did not mention is the danger from Naxalites who have made the Nallamala jungles their den. Even after the Andhra police flushed out Maoists from Nallamala in 2006, the forests have continued to be the centre of Naxalite activities.         
	Through the morning, the government, which had been sending out conflicting information since news broke about the missing copter, fumbled to explain why Reddy was allowed to fly in spite of reports of bad weather. Heavy rain lashed the Nallamala region from 11am and was preceded by dense clouds and severe wind.         
	The government was also at a loss to say why Reddy went on the Bell 430, an ageing machine that had been taken out of the chief ministers service. As replacement, the government had purchased a spanking new Augusta 139, which was grounded today for servicing.        
	By mid-afternoon, the war-room shifted from Hyderabad to North Block in Delhi with Union home minister P. Chidambaram taking charge and mounting the biggest search operation in recent times. Sources in North Block wondered why the Centre was informed three hours after the copter vanished from radar screens.        
	Eleven helicopters were pressed into service through the day, some of which had to return in the evening because of poor weather. By evening, the army had pushed in three columns into Nallamala. A Sukhoi-30 fighter was conducting sorties over the area, apparently for thermal imaging. It will be aided by two refuelling aircraft.         
	Commandos from the army and the CRPF as well as the elite anti-Naxalite force of Greyhounds were sent into the forests to conduct searches that will continue through the night. We have nothing to indicate that he is held by the Naxalites, but we are keeping our fingers crossed, said a home ministry official.        
	The search has narrowed to a 10km by 20km forest area spread over Guntur, Kurnool and Mahboobnagar districts.        
	Isro satellites were sending images of the area, but it was the agencys helicopter from Bangalore that is expected to give a realistic picture. The chopper with remote-sensing capability flew low over the forests and took 41 images that will give a better idea to security forces. Results would be available by tomorrow morning, national security adviser M.K. Narayanan told a TV channel.        
	At first light tomorrow, the armys special forces from north India will drop commandos at an area demarcated through the analysis of the Isro pictures.         
	State finance minister K. Rosaiah asked forest officials and residents of hamlets around the Nallamala forest to help in the search. Some ministers from Kurnool and Mahboobnagar set out with supporters into the forest zone.        
	A search in Nallamala, the largest stretch of undisturbed forest in south India apart from the Western Ghats, could be long and arduous. The last time a chopper disappeared over the thick forests of Andhra, it took three months to trace the machine and bring back the bodies.                           
	On August 8 last year, a Bell 430 Ran Air chopper, which took off from Raipur carrying four crew members, went missing. The wreckage was found three months later in the forest area of Andhras Khammam district, about 400km from Hyderabad, and similar to the Nallamala terrain.                           With inputs from Nishit Dholabhai and Ananya Sengupta

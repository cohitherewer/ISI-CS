The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Villagers bury 6-yr-old midday meal victim
                                                                                                           Villagers bury 6-yr-old midday meal victim

	Ranchi, July 22: A six-year-old succumbed to burns sustained after she allegedly fell into a vessel being used to cook a midday meal at a village school 20km from here on Monday, but residents are refusing to allow police to exhume her body for a post-mortem.        
	Angry villagers of Kolya Kandu near Pithoria blame teachers of the Utkramit Madhya Vidyalaya near Pithoria for Afsari Parveens death and have locked up the school.         
	Md Shamim, leading a group of vocal villagers, told The Telegraph that Afsari was in queue with other children to take her meal on Monday. The vessel in which the meal was being cooked was in front of them and there was no teacher present.        
	While children were jostling with each other to get their share, Afsari, who was in front, fell inside the vessel which was still very hot, he alleged. We rushed her to Kanke Nursing Home but she died of burns later in the evening.        
	Soon after the incident, the villagers decided to bury the child. Her parents agreed and Afsari was laid to rest without informing the police or the school principal, Shila Khess.         
	I have lost my child and do not want more controversy. I do not want to blame anybody, neither teachers nor anyone else, said Afsaris father, Md. Manjur.        
	The police came to know of the incident on Tuesday and went there today to investigate. But hundreds of villagers, armed with traditional weapons, prevented them from venturing near the spot where she had been buried.        
	Throughout the day, villagers stood guard on the road leading to Pithoria and did not allow anyone to reach Kolya Kandu. They prevented the police from exhuming the body, forcing them to turn back.        
	Weve registered a case of unnatural death. If the villagers jointly give us a letter saying that they do not want a post-mortem, we will give up the idea of exhuming the body, said Pithoria police station officer-in-charge Anil Kumar.         
	But, local opposition cannot be a reason for the police not to pursue a probe. Former advocate-general A.K. Sinha said the police could not say no to investigations. The police are mandated to collect evidence to investigate the case under section 154 of CrPC after an FIR is lodged. And exhuming the body is part of collecting evidence.        
	Director of primary education D.K. Saxena, said the incident appeared to be a case of gross negligence on the part of teachers. I have been told that nobody was attending to the students while the meal was to be distributed, he said.        
	Saxena has ordered the district education officer, P. Choubey, to conduct an inquiry and send a report so that action can be taken against those responsible. Choubey did visit the school today, but refused to comment.

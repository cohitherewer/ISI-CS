  - Ousted from CPM, Speaker finds place at Bengal events          OUR BUREAU                            Somnath Chatterjee addresses the fair as Joykrishna Ghosh, the confidential assistant of Jyoti Basu, and minister Pratim Chatterjee (left) look on. Telegraph picture                                        
	Calcutta, Jan. 16: Prakash Karat may have no room for Somnath Chatterjee but platforms blessed by the CPM are offering the nirdol veteran pride of place in Bengal.        
	Chatterjee was the chief guest today at the launch of Bidhannagar Mela  Salt Lakes biggest event of its kind usually inaugurated by the townships most famous resident, Jyoti Basu.        
	This year, the VIP vacancy arose because of Basus poor health. Opinion varies on why Chatterjee was chosen in the patriarchs place  the organisers say Basu himself suggested the replacement but a close aide credited the fair committee with the decision.        
	Whoever was the driving force behind inviting the Speaker, the occasion came a few days after transport minister Subhas Chakraborty made it public that he had written to the party requesting that Chatterjee be reinstated. Karat had then downplayed the possibility of a rethink.        
	Undeterred, Chakraborty today shared the Salt Lake dais with Chatterjee  both are close to Basu. So did Basus confidential assistant Joykrishna Ghosh and fire services minister Pratim Chatterjee.        
	Asked about their choice of chief guest, Swapan Mitra, the fairs convenor, press and publicity sub-committee, said: Chatterjee had come for the closing ceremony of Harekrishna Ghosh Memorial Football Tournament on December 7 (named after Joykrishna Ghoshs brother). Thereafter, he went to visit the ailing Basu at his residence. There, Basu asked Chatterjee to inaugurate the fair this year as he could not do so himself.         
	Joykrishna Ghosh is the working president of the Bidhannagar Mela. At first, he refused to comment but later said the fair committee, not Basu, had requested the Speaker to do the honours.         
	Chatterjee -- who said ami nirdol (I am independent) on his way in, asked about his political status  stuck to the theme at his speech, too.         
	We are not able to develop our country the way we want to. There may be a difference of opinions among political parties but when it comes to developing the nation we need to forget our differences and work towards achieving our goals. Jealousy, bickering and negative criticism have become a norm among members of political parties. If such things happen in a party how can a party function in harmony? Chatterjee asked after inaugurating the 19th edition of the fair.        
	Asked whether he had received any call from the CPM, Chatterjee said: No. I am independent and I dont belong to any party now. I have become old that is why everybody calls me.         
	But Chatterjee did make utterances with which the CPM would not be able to disagree. He spoke highly of the states industrialisation effort and echoed chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee. Agriculture cannot alone improve the lot of people. Industrialisation is also necessary. But some people are politicising the issue of development. All political parties should work together for the development of the state.         
	He added: At a time, the state is undergoing industrial rejuvenation, a movement by some political parties has stalled it.        
	Less than a week ago, Chatterjee had shared another platform with CPM leaders  perhaps an indication of the support he enjoys in Bengal and a handy avenue to let the central leadership read that pulse.        
	On Sunday, Chatterjee was the chief guest at the closing ceremony of the industrial fair at Baruipur in South 24-Parganas. He was flanked by CPMs Jadavpur MP Sujan Chakraborty and Baruipur MLA Rahul Ghosh.        
	 Chatterjee had then said: Though the party has expelled me, I am still CPM at heart.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | CM tamasha thunder stirs anger in icon fans
                                                                                                           CM tamasha thunder stirs anger in icon fans
          OUR BUREAU                              
	Calcutta, Aug. 23: Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee today suggested Mamata Banerjee had made fun (tamasha) of Bengals icons in relation to a Metro Rail programme, provoking repartees from sections of the film fraternity that used to be his undisputed constituency.        
	The chief ministers outburst also prompted the Opposition to claim that the railway ministers promise-a-day regimen had begun to unnerve the Left.        
	What is the railway authority doing? We know the pathetic state of railways and there is no change in it. Pratidin ekta korey train chharche bajaarey (Everyday, a new train is being announced), Bhattacharjee told a CPM rally held to mourn the death of Subhas Chakraborty.        
	Bhattacharjee did not name Mamata but referred to her trophy meeting at Tollygunge yesterday to inaugurate the Metros extended line.        
	What happened yesterday at the Metro Rail function? Comrade Ranjit (Kundu, the new transport minister) didnt attend. Kar rail ke chalachchhe (whose railway is being run by whom)? Bhattacharjee asked, alluding to the 33 per cent expenses borne by the state government in the Metro Rail extension.         
	The transport minister had stayed away yesterday, saying the invitation was given to him in a shabby manner. The minister said a Railway Protection Force officer had left the invitation at his office and later a fax was sent by a railway general manager.        
	The chief minister, whose invitation was given to his secretariat by Metro Rail officials in exchange for an acknowledgement, did not attend either but did not cite any reason yesterday.        
	But today, the chief minister ripped the veneer. They published photographs of Bengals great sons (manishi) Masterda (Surya Sen, revolutionary freedom fighter), Nazrul (Islam, poet) and Netaji. Banglar manishider niye tamasha korey tader apaman kara hoyechhe (the great sons of Bengal were made fun of and insulted). Will Bengals people remain spectators to this defiling (byavichar) of our cultural tradition and freedom struggle? Bhattacharjee said.        
	The chief minister did not clarify how the icons were insulted or whether he was specifically objecting to the stations being named after them  an undeclared usurpation card played by most political parties. The CPM itself is no stranger to renaming roads after Marx, Lenin and Ho Chi Minh.        
	The word tamasha touched a raw nerve in some of those who attended yesterdays meeting that had a high representation from Tollywood, the turnout attributed mainly to the tribute to Uttam Kumar and to some extent to the change in political fortunes in the state.        
	Stations have been named after legends, including Uttam Kumar. I dont think that it is a tamasha, Supriya Devi, who had acted in several films with the icon, said. I will have to rethink the meaning of tamasha after the comments made by the chief minister.        
	Actor Chiranjeet, who also attended the Metro Rail event, said: I dont understand how naming a Metro station after legends or using their pictures can be a tamasha. These names are used for so many things  houses, roads, museums. At the event, so many people were present, starting from the governor, central ministers, artistes and the general public. No one felt it was a tamasha. I dont belong to any party.        
	A part of the chief ministers statement suggests he may have been referring to a railway advertisement in Saturdays newspapers announcing the programme.        
	The advertisement features the photographs of icons ranging from Uttam Kumar to Kazi Nazrul, their names and then the location of the station in brackets. Among other personalities in the advertisement is state transport minister Kundu.        
	The ad did not mention the chief minister  there is no laid-down rule requiring such an inclusion, railway sources said. The names of dignitaries to feature on the ad were sent by the railway ministers office, they said.         
	The sources said that according to the railways public relations manual, a chief minister has to be invited, but not necessarily as a guest of honour. A place on the dais is guaranteed to a guest of honour, according to the rituals that bind government events, although little prevents the organisers from accommodating an ordinary guest, too, if they choose so.        
	Trinamul responded with glee to the chief ministers criticism, terming it an outburst of his frustration after repeated setbacks at the hustings. The chief ministers description of naming Metro stations after manishis as tamasha is an outburst of his frustration after losing the elections. Now the time has come for him to bid goodbye to Writers Buildings, said Trinamul state president Subrata Bakshi.        
	Mamata has been announcing project after project ever since she took over the central ministry. Opposition leaders saw in the chief ministers statement today  the harshest since Mamata started promising the projects  a reflection of the concern within the CPM on the impact of the announcements on the electorate even if details of implementation have not been thrashed out.

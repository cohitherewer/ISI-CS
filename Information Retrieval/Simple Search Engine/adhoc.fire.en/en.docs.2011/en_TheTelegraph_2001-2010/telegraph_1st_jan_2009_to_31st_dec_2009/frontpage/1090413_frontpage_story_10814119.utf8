The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Braving bandh, but cautiously
                                                                                                           Braving bandh, but cautiously
          AMIT GUPTA                            Babulal Marandi: Unfazed                                  
	Ranchi, April 12: The 24-hour statewide bandh called by Maoists today failed to keep our candidates indoors, albeit prompting many to tread with extra caution.         
	Most leaders grabbed the opportunity to woo voters in rural pockets with barely 48 hours remaining before campaigning for the first phase of Lok Sabha election drew to an end. They selected safe campaign spots such as block headquarters and not-so-remote villages. Some, however, thought it wiser to cancel a programme or two.        
	JVM(P) president and former chief minister Babulal Marandi was perhaps the only leader who ventured into some remote areas of Lohardaga to campaign for party candidate Bahura Ekka.         
	Ekka, former vice-chancellor of Vinoba Bhave University and now director of Academic Staff College of Ranchi University, said that the environment in rural areas was not conducive to electioneering during a rebel bandh. Marandi, however, addressed two meetings in Ghaghra and Kairo villages  both Naxalite strongholds.         
	Jharkhand Janadhikar Manch candidate from Lohardaga Rama Khalkho falls in the second category. She candidly admitted that her party had cancelled a meeting at Bishunpur in Gumla district in the wake of the bandh.         
	Khalkho, however, held rallies in villages such as Gamharia and Ghaghra that are not tucked away in some rebel stronghold. The Ranchi mayor sure has her reasons. A couple of days ago, her campaign vehicle was torched by rebels.         
	Similar attacks were also reported from Palamau and Chatra parliamentary constituencies. In Palamau, the rebels torched a JVM(P) vehicle campaigning for party candidate Prabhat Kumar Bhuiyan in Hariharganj area this morning.        
	Not willing to risk a road journey, Ajsus Sudesh Mahto reached his pre-scheduled destinations in Palamau by air. Only a few rallies happened. No campaigning took place in remote villages, a JVM(P) worker confirmed.        
	Sitting MP and Congress nominee from Lohardaga Rameshwar Oraon also hopped on to a helicopter to reach Sisai, Senha, Kuru and Mandar. along with some of the senior Congress leaders.         
	In Palamau, a local villager said: The usual hustle-bustle of village crowd was missing, as people did not come out in droves to listen to political speeches on a bandh day. The next two days of campaigning will be hectic.         
	Todays bandh was called in protest against the killings of two CPI(Maoist) rebels in Chatras Simaria a few days ago.

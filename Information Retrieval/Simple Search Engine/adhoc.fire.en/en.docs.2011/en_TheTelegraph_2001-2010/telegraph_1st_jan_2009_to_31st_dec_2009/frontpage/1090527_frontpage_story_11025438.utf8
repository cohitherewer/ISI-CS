          OUR CORRESPONDENT                                     
	New Delhi, May 26: A 25-year-old Manipuri youth, Gaijaomei George, was arrested here yesterday for murdering his pregnant girlfriend.        
	The body of 25-year-old Lily Kamei (name changed), also from Manipur, was recovered from the thick jungles of Banta Hills in North Delhi on May 14 by local police. Three cans of beer lay near the body.         
	A post-mortem revealed that Lily was four months pregnant. However, since no identification was found on the person or at the site of the murder, the body was kept at the mortuary.         
	What baffled the police was that no one filed a missing persons report even days after the murder. They circulated a picture of the body to surrounding police stations.         
	It was at one of these that Lilys sister, Easter, with whom she lived, identified the body from the maroon top and black jeans.        
	Though reports of the murder and a description of the clothes worn by the murdered person had been published in the media the day after the body was found, Easter said she did not suspect foul play as Lily had gone out with Roshan, Georges friend, whom the family knew well.         
	She started getting worried when Lily did not come home even after five days and neither Roshan nor George answered calls. She then went to the police stations, where she was shown the photo and identified Lily. After interrogating Easter, we found that Lily had gone out with Roshan and George that day. George, who was arrested, initially tried to wriggle out of it but finally confessed to the crime.        
	George told the police that Lily was having affairs with other men and that made him angry. He took her to the park on the pretext of having a drink and they had a heated argument over her dalliances. He claimed that when she denied his allegations, he slit her throat while Roshan covered her mouth and held her by the hair, investigating officer Suraj Bhan said.         
	The duo left the body in the park and Roshan left Delhi.         
	The police recovered the murder weapon, a knife, and the blood-stained clothes of George from his house.         
	George, the son of a lower-level government official in Manipur, had come to Delhi in 2007 and was preparing for the UPSC exam. Lily was a nurse in a private hospital at Model Town in North Delhi and had quit her job recently.

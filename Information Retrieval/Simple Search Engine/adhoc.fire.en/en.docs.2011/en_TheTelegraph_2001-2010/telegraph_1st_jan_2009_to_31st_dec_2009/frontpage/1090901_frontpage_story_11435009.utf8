The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Centre to take hands off VC list
                                                                                                           Centre to take hands off VC list
          CHARU SUDAN KASTURI                               
	New Delhi, Aug. 31: The Centre is withdrawing from the role of selecting university vice-chancellors under a radical mechanism aimed at freeing such appointments from political influence.        
	A collegium of experts will be given charge of shortlisting candidates for VCs at Indias central universities, replacing a decades-old system of a government panel picking nominees, education minister Kapil Sibal said today.        
	The move follows years of criticism of the governments perceived duplicity in claiming that it encourages autonomy of higher educational institutions while hand-picking favourites to run these institutes.        
	It also comes close on the heels of one of the most long-drawn and fiercely contested vice-chancellor selections in recent times  at the Jamia Millia Islamia university.        
	The collegium will have powers to nominate VCs of only central universities. Universities run by state governments, such as the one in Bengal which has often been accused of interference in educational institutions, will not fall under the ambit of the collegium.        
	But Sibal today asked state governments to follow suit and either set up state mechanisms to guarantee independent selections to the posts of VCs or amend laws to allow the Centre to perform the task.        
	The collegium will be created through an act of Parliament and will also nominate members to the National Council for Higher Education and Research, a new overarching higher education regulator the government is creating.        
	The collegium will have a self-selecting structure so that successive governments at the Centre are unable to pick their favourites as members, Sibal said. He was speaking at the 56th meeting of the Central Advisory Board of Education, the apex education advisory body.        
	For instance, he said, the collegium could have as its member a Nobel laureate like Amartya Sen, and heads of prestigious scientific and humanities-based institutions.        
	It could include the president of the Indian National Science Academy (Insa), one of the countrys three major collectives of scientists. The membership to the collegium will automatically get transferred to the person holding the post of Insa president. No salaried government official shall be a member of the collegium.        
	At present, the human resource development ministry sets up a search-cum-selection committee each time the post of a VC falls vacant at a central university.         
	Often, however, ministry insiders admit, the minister himself indicates a favourite among candidates who have applied for the vacant post. The search panel is then selected with nominees who invariably rubberstamp the ministers choice.        
	Members of the panel are salaried government officials  VCs of other universities, chairpersons of regulatory bodies or directors of institutes like IITs  who need the ministers support to stay in office.        
	Under the proposed mechanism, the collegium, in consultation with subject-specific experts, will pick a set of nominees for VCs. The list will be handed over to the HRD ministry which will pick one of the nominees.        
	If the ministry is dissatisfied with all the names, it can send the list back to the collegium to reconsider. This process can repeat itself as many times as is necessary for the collegium and the government to arrive at a common name.        
	But the government cannot insist that the collegium nominate a particular person.

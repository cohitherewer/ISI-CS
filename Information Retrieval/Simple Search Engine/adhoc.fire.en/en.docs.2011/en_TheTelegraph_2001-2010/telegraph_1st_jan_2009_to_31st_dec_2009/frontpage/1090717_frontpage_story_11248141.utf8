                                                                                                           Cong smells chance after street rampage
          OUR BUREAU                              
	Calcutta, July 16: A buoyant Congress has called a 12-hour bandh on Friday from 6am, hoping to come out of the shadow of the Trinamul Congress, after using an opportunity gifted by the CPM to display long-forgotten street muscle.        
	Congress supporters today burnt buses and blocked roads in the city and adjoining districts to protest the attack on its MLAs in Burdwan yesterday, giving party a feeling of potency it had forgotten a long time ago and the scent of a chance to reassert itself.        
	Trinamul has extended moral support to tomorrows bandh  the first potent call for shutdown since a Citu strike almost a year ago in last August.                
	The attack on the MLAs has posed a test for chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee  whether he will be able to proceed against the accused, some of whom could be linked to the powerful Burdwan unit of the CPM.         
	In the Assembly, the chief minister condemned the attack and admitted the administrations lapses in letting the situation slip out of control. The police failed to assess the situation beforehand and did not realise it would flare up so dangerously, Bhattacharjee said. I would be failing in my responsibility if I merely condemned the attack.        
	Yesterday afternoon, armed CPM activists chased Congress MLAs across slushy paddy fields in Dhanyarukhi, Mangalkot, and attacked them with stones, injuring one of them badly enough to need eight stitches and another to be admitted to hospital.        
	Trinamul leader Mamata said the Centre should intervene immediately. I have spoken to home minister P. Chidambaram and finance minister Pranab Mukherjee. They have promised to look into the matter, she said.        
	Bengal chief secretary Asok Mohan Chakrabarti said: The administration will ensure that ministers and political leaders can go to Mangalkot. But why should they only want to go to Mangalkot, Khejuri and Darjeeling? There are so many other places they can go to.        
	If the senior-most official was trying his hand at humour, few who went through a harrowing day in the state would have been amused.        
	Congress supporters descended on the streets in Calcutta, North 24-Parganas, Howrah and Nadia, joined by Trinamul workers at some places. The mayhem seemed to gladden the Congress, eager for a resurgence.        
	Congress supporters coming out on the roads, deflating bus tyres and setting them ablaze are things we had forgotten a long time ago, particularly after Mamata took centre-stage, said Congress working president Subrata Mukherjee.        
	Police stood by as mobs besieged thoroughfares from Esplanade to Gariahat and Sealdah to Howrah at the 9am rush hour, blocking traffic and targeting state buses. Six government buses burnt, one of them in Murshidabad, and many more had their windscreens and windows smashed.        
	Traffic across south Calcutta went haywire as Congress supporters put up roadblocks at Hazra, the Rashbehari crossing, Jadubabur Bazar and Jadavpur. From 11am till noon, the Youth Congress blocked both Howrah bridge lanes, forcing thousands to get off buses and cars and walk across.        
	Trains in Eastern Railways Howrah division were disrupted for hours.

                                                                                                           Cabinet clears road for 16 new varsities
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                             more options                                   
	New Delhi, Jan. 9: The cabinet today approved a human resource development ministry plan to introduce an ordinance that will enable the government to create 16 new central universities before the Lok Sabha elections.         
	It also cleared proposed amendments to the definition of minority educational institutions, which may assist the UPA to resolve a long-pending dispute over the Aligarh Muslim University in its favour.         
	The HRD ministry had listed a bill to legalise the 16 central universities in the December session of Parliament. But the bill, which proposes starting 12 universities afresh and converting four state ones, could not be tabled.         
	The Goa University was among the state universities which were to be upgraded, but the state government asked the ministry to withdraw it from the list.         
	As reported by The Telegraph on January 2, the HRD ministry then started fresh attempts to launch the central universities amid fears of the declaration of a model code of conduct. Once the election code is announced, new government sops can be challenged before the Election Commission. The UPA government completes its term in May.        
	On January 2, the ministry worked overtime to prepare plans on the new universities to be presented to the cabinet.         
	A draft ordinance is ready and will be sent early next week to the President for her approval, a senior HRD ministry official said.         
	The new set of universities will come up in 16 states that at present do not have a central university.         
	The cabinet also approved amendments to the National Commission for Minority Educational Institutions Act, 2004.         
	The law  which came into force in 2005  at present does not cover universities as minority educational institutions, though the Aligarh university, through an amendment to its law in 1981, was declared a minority institution.         
	Allahabad High Court, in 2006, struck down the minority status of the university while hearing a PIL that cited the minority institutions act.         
	Under the proposed amendments, first reported by The Telegraph on March 8, 2008, the definition of minority educational institutions is expanded to cover universities, too.         
	Minority educational institutions are protected under the Constitution from any infringement on their autonomy. Such institutions are not required to follow reservations for students from scheduled castes, scheduled tribes or other backward classes. They can, instead, favour students from their community.         
	They also dont need to stick to a number of other government regulations  related to fees, admissions etc.  that are binding on other higher educational institutions.         
	The idea behind the constitutional exemption is to allow communities traditionally backward in education standards an opportunity to build institutions that can cater to their specific needs, allowing them to catch up with others.

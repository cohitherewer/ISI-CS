The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | India damper and breather   Delhi hole in Obama first agenda; silence on N-test 
                                                                                                           India damper and breather 
  Delhi hole in Obama first agenda; silence on N-test           K.P. NAYAR                                    
	Washington, Jan. 21: The very first foreign policy document issued by President Barack Obamas White House completely and comprehensively ignores India.        
	In Asia, the new administration has unveiled its vision for bilateral relationships with Japan, South Korea and Australia. But not India.        
	Obama and (Vice-President Joe) Biden will forge a more effective framework in Asia that goes beyond bilateral agreements, occasional summits, and ad hoc arrangements, says The Agenda  Foreign Policy, a document that deals with what the administration plans to do with the entire globe.        
	In the section devoted to Asia, it says they will maintain strong ties with allies like Japan, South Korea and Australia.        
	The new President and Vice-President will work to ensure that China plays by international rules.        
	Even the Asean region is mentioned with the promise to build an infrastructure with countries in East Asia that can promote stability and prosperity. But not India.        
	Previously, South Block has taken the view that incoming Presidents and administrations in foreign countries tend to dwell on problem areas in the globe and immediate challenges in their early foreign policy initiatives. It has argued that India is better off when it is not clubbed with crisis locations and stressed that bilateral relations with the US are smooth.        
	However, the Obama document is not a list of problems. It is the new administrations vision of the world.        
	But there are two pieces of good news. First, the US consulate in Calcutta will continue to function. The Calcutta post has been repeatedly put on the chopping block by cost-cutting committees and the state departments review panels in previous years. That threat is now over.        
	To make diplomacy a priority, Obama and Biden will stop shuttering consulates and start opening them in difficult corners of the world, the document adds. The priority for new diplomatic posts will, however, be in Africa.        
	The second cause for comfort in New Delhi is that the document makes no mention of the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT), which is a red rag for Indians.        
	In his last written communication to Manmohan Singh, Obama had told the Prime Minister that I will work with the US Senate to secure ratification of the international treaty banning nuclear weapons testing at the earliest practical day, and then launch a major diplomatic initiative to ensure its entry into force.        
	For now it appears that this is not to be, but much will depend on the team that will take charge of the non-proliferation bureau in the state department soon.        
	The White House document expresses strong support for the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT), but only in the context of Iran and North Korea. All the same, New Delhi will have to be on its guard about what the administration does in this regard.        
	Obama and Biden will crack down on nuclear proliferation by strengthening the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty so that countries like North Korea and Iran that break the rules will automatically face strong international sanctions.        
	There is, however, broad agreement with India on a common goal of universal disarmament. Obama and Biden will set a goal of a world without nuclear weapons, and pursue it. They will stop the development of new nuclear weapons.        
	On Pakistan, the document says the new administration will increase non-military aid to Pakistan and hold them accountable for security in the border region with Afghanistan.        
	It lists the resurgence of al Qaida and the Taliban in Afghanistan and Pakistan as the greatest threat to our security and promises an increase in US troops in Afghanistan.        
	It is not yet clear to what extent the delay in swearing in secretary of state Hillary Clinton influenced this document, which had no inputs from the new state department.        
	The delay cast a shadow on Obamas planned foreign policy meetings today in the White House, where Clinton was to have been sworn in.        
	There was some unfavourable publicity for India today in the new Senate when a certain Amar Singhs contributions to the William J. Clinton Foundation came up during a full Senate discussion on Clintons confirmation.        
	Republican Senator John Cornyn, a friend of India who heads the Senate India Caucus, raised the contribution issue. He has put a hold on the new secretary of state, whose nomination is, however, expected to be voted on by a roll call later in the day.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Slumdog: hit today, almost killed off yesterday
                                                                                                           Slumdog: hit today, almost killed off yesterday
  - Bafta-winning screenplay writer keen to make musical, director sets sights on thriller in Mumbai           AMIT ROY                            AR Rahman and Danny Boyle at the Bafta awards. Rahman won a Bafta for best music score. (AFP)                                         
	London, Feb. 9: Slumdog Millionaire, the hit movie gathering armfuls of awards by the day, including seven Baftas in London last night, was very nearly killed off by those who did not believe the project would work, the films screenplay writer, Simon Beaufoy, has revealed.        
	But the film has proved to be such a success that it could be turned into a musical, added Beaufoy, whose screenplay, adapted from Vikas Swarups novel, Q amp;A, won him a Bafta.        
	Danny Boyle, who won a Bafta for Best Director, disclosed that he was so taken with Mumbais Manhattan-like quality that he was keen to return to set a thriller in the city.        
	 What I would really love is to do a musical, enthused Beaufoy. People are wondering, everyone in India is going out of the cinema saying, Wait a minute, (only) one dance? They go to Bollywood and you get standard five dance numbers. I think we could put this onstage and do 10 dance numbers and that would be wonderful.        
	Since in Britain alone, the film has taken twice its 7 million budget at the box office, not to mention over $67 million in the US, Beaufoys wishes may yet be granted.        
	In A.R. Rahman, who has already done the music for two West End musicals, Bombay Dreams in 2002 and The Lord of the Rings in 2007, he will have an experienced collaborator.                  
	Beaufoy said he was initially reluctant to take on the job of adapting Swarups novel. It seemed such a difficult book to adapt, he had felt. It is really a series of short stories and I was not sure how I was going to do it really, but Tessa (Ross, the controller of Film 4) just forced a plane ticket into my hands and said, Go, see what you think. When you go to India, things become very clear very quickly and you know what to do then.        
	Asked why so much from Swarups novel had been left out, Beaufoy responded: It was not so much a case of leaving things out. Once I decided that it had to be foremost a love story, I had to work backwards from that and reinvent the stories. So I tried to tie as much of the book from the new narrative, but inevitably things get left out. Because of what happened with the film and how it nearly never saw the light of day, there was no sense of entitlement. This was a very small film with a very small budget. Each step of the way was a delight.        
	At one time, there was apprehension the film would not get made. We are still really, really excited, by the way the film is being received by people but actually a few months ago we were looking at a film that was not even coming out in the States in cinemas. Every step has been a delight because we thought at every stage we were going straight to DVD. So that is an added excitement to every award ceremony.        
	As for Boyle, asked if had been bitten by the India bug, he replied: I would love to make a thriller there.        
	He said that all the time he was shooting Slumdog, you could see the film the city was crying out for  a thriller. It is Manhattan in the 70s. You think of the thrillers in Manhattan, the 70s. It has got that vibe about it which is, anything is possible. We owe everything to that city and its spirit.

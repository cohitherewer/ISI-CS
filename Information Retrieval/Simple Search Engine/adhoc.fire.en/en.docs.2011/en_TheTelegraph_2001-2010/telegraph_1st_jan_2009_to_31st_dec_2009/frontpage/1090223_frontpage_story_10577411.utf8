          JOBY WARRICK                             Musharraf, Singh                                 
	Washington, Feb. 22: India and Pakistan engaged in nearly three years of secret, high-level talks that narrowly missed achieving a historic breakthrough in the conflict over Kashmir, according to an account set for publication this week.        
	The negotiations, which began in 2004, produced the outlines of an accord that would have allowed a gradual demilitarisation of the disputed area.        
	The effort stalled in 2007, and the prospects for a settlement were further undermined by the terrorist attacks on Mumbai in November, the report said.        
	The peace initiative is described in an article by investigative journalist Steve Coll, who writes in New Yorker magazine that the two sides had come to semicolons in their negotiations when the effort lost steam.        
	The attempt ultimately failed, not because of substantive differences, Coll writes, but because declining political fortunes left Pakistans then President, Pervez Musharraf, without the clout he needed to sell the agreement at home. Although Musharraf fought for the deal  as did Prime Minister Manmohan Singh  the President became so weakened politically that he couldnt sell himself, let alone a surprise peace deal, Coll says, quoting Pakistani and Indian officials. Musharraf resigned as President in August.        
	Coll, a former Washington Post managing editor who won a Pulitzer Prize in 2005 for his book Ghost Wars, writes that the resolution of the Kashmir dispute was the cornerstone of a broad agreement that would have represented a paradigm shift.        
	Under the plan, the Kashmir conflict would have been resolved through the creation of an autonomous region in which residents could move freely and conduct trade on both sides. Over time, the border would become irrelevant, and declining violence would allow a gradual withdrawal of tens of thousands of troops.        
	It was huge  I think it would have changed the basic nature of the problem, an Indian official was quoted as saying. You would have then had the freedom to remake Indo-Pakistani relations.        
	The secret negotiations consisted of about two dozen meetings in hotel rooms in various overseas locations. The sessions revolved around developing a document known as a non-paper  text that bears no names or signatures and can serve as a deniable but detailed basis for a deal.         
	The US and the UK were aware of the talks and offered low-key support and advice but otherwise elected to let India and Pakistan settle their disputes unaided.        
	Musharraf is portrayed as an enthusiastic supporter of the deal who succeeded in winning converts among the sceptical military leadership.        
	But in March 2007, as the two capitals were discussing plans for a historic summit, Musharraf became embroiled in a public feud with his countrys highest court that culminated in his resignation. Bilateral relations began a downward slide thereafter.

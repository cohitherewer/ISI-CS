The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Mission tourism: I-Day cricket in Swiss Alps
                                                                                                           Mission tourism: I-Day cricket in Swiss Alps
  - A six in the mountains          AMIT ROY                            Kapil Dev at the match in Switzerland                                        
	London, Aug. 16: Indians appear to be moving up in the world, both literally and metaphorically, judging by an India versus England cricket match held yesterday on Independence Day on Jungfrau, 3,454m high up in the Swiss mountains.        
	Kapil Dev, who led India to another historic win, called the match a historical event and an outstanding experience.        
	The idea is to promote Indian tourism in Switzerland, especially hot love in a cold climate.        
	A lot of young couples on honeymoon come here already, Daniela Fuchs, a spokesperson for the promoters, told The Telegraph today.        
	The Swiss would like to see many more and there are a number of ways in which Indian couples can get cosy.         
	Some special offers will be heavily advertised in India to mark the centenary of Jungfrau Railways  this sweeps holidaymakers into the scary but spectacular mountain peaks  with two-for-one discounts.        
	A typical offer states: Two people can stay overnight in a hotel and receive a ski pass for the price normally paid by one person. The offer is valid for two nights, from 5 to 24 December 2009 and 15 March to 18 April 2010. With this promotion, Jungfrau Railways intends to strengthen its presence in the Indian market.        
	Those hankering for desi food can always pop into the Bollywood Restaurant which has mysteriously materialised, complete with an Indian chef, on top of the Jungfrau. But those couples who would rather not be recognised may find it prudent to give it a miss for there is never any shortage of Indians  even on top of a Swiss mountain.        
	For example, for yesterdays game, Indian tourists and autograph hunters were out in force and went crazy when the ball cleared the boundary snow.        
	The 45-minute, six-a-side fun cricket match was held on a 100m x 70m wide field of ice using a special ball, heavier than a tennis ball but not the usual 5.5oz ball that might have sunk into soft snow.        
	While Mansur Ali Khan, the erstwhile Nawab of Pataudi, and Farokh Engineer, officiated as umpires, the Indian team consisted of stars of yesteryear  Kapil (who did need his dark glasses so he could see the ball as the sun bounced off the slabs of ice), Ajay Jadeja, Sandip Patil, Roger Binny, Anshuman Gaekwad and Syed Kirmani.        
	The England team, made up of players who now live mostly in Britain, included Alvin Kallicharan, Geoff Howarth, Chris Broad, Neal Radford, John Emburey and Collis King.        
	Since Indians love cricket, we thought we would hold a cricket match, said Daniela. We flew in the Indian cricketers from Delhi and Mumbai. They played hard and, luckily, the Indian team won by 4 runs.        
	It was left to Pataudis actress wife and Indias censor board chairman Sharmila Tagore, to provide the glamour.        
	She told me that she has come to Switzerland in the past for several of her films, said Daniela.        
	Indeed, once upon a time Switzerland used to be almost the only place abroad where Hindi film song-and-dance routines were shot before the UK, Malaysia, Thailand, Australia, Singapore and America got in on the act.        
	The match was sponsored by Swiss International Air Lines, with help from Beyond Boundaries, Switzerland Tourism, Interlaken Tourism and Longines.        
	The Jungfrau Region, home of the awe-inspiring Eiger, Mnch amp; Jungfrau peaks in the Alps, is popular with holidaymakers who have traditionally based themselves in Interlaken, Grindelwald, Wengen and Mrren.         
	The sixth James Bond movie, On Her Majestys Secret Service (1969), starring George Lazenby as British agent 007, was filmed in Schiltorn in the Jungfrau region of central Switzerland.

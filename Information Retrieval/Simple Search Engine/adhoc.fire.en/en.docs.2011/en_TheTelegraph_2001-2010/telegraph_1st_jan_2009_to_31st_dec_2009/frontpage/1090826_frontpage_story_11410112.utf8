The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Vedics fair-weather friend   Outraged now, govt had bailed out group
                                                                                                           Vedics fair-weather friend 
   Outraged now, govt had bailed out group          ANINDYA SENGUPTA                                                    
	Calcutta, Aug. 25: If investors cant do without fair-weather friends, look no farther than the Bengal government.        
	The state home secretary had yesterday spoken of a land mafia and acquisition at gunpoint in relation to the Vedic Village flare-up.         
	But what was left unspoken was the cosy relationship between the Vedic Village group and the state government, land and land reforms department officials said today.        
	So warm was the relationship that the state government had agreed to an out-of-court settlement that helped the group avert what could have been a potentially troublesome legal battle.        
	Seven years ago, three partners of Vedic Village bought 44 acres in Rajarhat but applied for mutation in 12 names. The reason: the more the owners, the less the mutation cost. But, officials said, the state government stumbled onto this and objected on the ground that the information was false.        
	Vedic Village moved court against the governments objections but lost the case. However, the government soon agreed to an out-of-court settlement.        
	The out-of-court agreement, officials said, was that the state government would transfer the 44 acres to itself and then give the land on a 99-year-old lease to Vedic Village. In return, Vedic Village would pay the state government 95 per cent of the land cost.        
	But a bigger, undeclared dividend for the group was that the deal averted further legal proceedings on the alleged submission of false information.        
	For the government, the agreement offered a chance to realise its deep interest in setting up an information technology park in Rajarhat.        
	As the first step, Vedic Village, headed by Raj Modi, in collaboration with the Diamond Group of Amarnath Shroff, would float Akash Nirman to venture into land purchase. In the next step, Webel, the IT arm of the government, would tie up with Akash Nirman to form Webel Akash IT Link. The tie-up came through in May-June last year.        
	Land department officials said it was decided that Akash Nirman would acquire 1,200 acres in Rajarhat. Of this, 600 acres would be given free to the government. The government, in turn, could sell this land to IT majors like Wipro, Infosys and TCS.        
	But the state government would have to do its bit, too. Webels role was to attract IT companies on the 600 acres it would get, an official said. As a reciprocal gesture, Webel would create basic infrastructure like roads, sewerage and water supply, not only for its own 600 acres but also for the remaining 600 acres that Akash Nirman would keep.        
	The official said the idea was to allow the private partner to set up small and medium IT centres, townships, entertainment centres, malls and plexes on its 600 acres by charging high rates for land. The presence of IT majors in the neighbourhood would have ensured the high rates, the official said.        
	But a senior finance department official felt that the deal was tilted against the government as it would have to spend Rs 760 crore on developing infrastructure. The officials views were overruled, following which he sought a transfer that was granted.        
	So far, we have benefited to the extent of 200 acres through this arrangement, said IT minister Debesh Das.         
	The underlying principle behind the quid pro quo is not illegal and the government could have agreed to the deal to keep its hands off messy land acquisition.        
	But the alacrity with which one arm of the government spoke of the land mafia masked the extent of the association of another with the group.        
	Asked why the government had not taken any action against Vedic Village if a land mafia was involved, home secretary Ardhendu Sen said: We know whats happening there. But if theres no specific complaint against them (the owners), what can we do?

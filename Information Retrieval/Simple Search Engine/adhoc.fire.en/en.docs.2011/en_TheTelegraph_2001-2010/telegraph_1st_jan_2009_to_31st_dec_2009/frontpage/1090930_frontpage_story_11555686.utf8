The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | KLNLF suspends ethnic cleansing
                                                                                                           KLNLF suspends ethnic cleansing
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Nagaon, Sept. 29: The Karbi militant outfit, Karbi Longri NC Hills Liberation Front (KLNLF), today announced the suspension of its operations against Hindi-speaking people in the greater interest of peace and development.        
	The declaration will come as a great relief for the large number of Hindi-speaking people based in Karbi Anglong. The outfit has killed as many as 30 Hindi-speaking people and torched hundreds of houses in a series of attacks in 2007.         
	KLNLF publicity secretary Rezek Dera said the outfit was committed to peace and therefore will wait for a positive response from the government to its offer for talks.        
	Dera, who spoke to The Telegraph over telephone from an undisclosed location, said as the outfit was moving towards democratic negotiations of our demands its leadership felt that all types of operations, either on Hindi-speaking people or attacks on government property, should be stopped.        
	Our two-month deadline for the government to respond to our ceasefire offer will end on Wednesday. We would like to wait and watch for some more time as we resolve to refrain from bloodshed.         
	Earlier, the militant group had said it would launch massive operations against the Hindi-speaking people living in the Karbi areas from October if the government did not show sincerity to its offer of political dialogue.        
	The outfit had also ruled out surrender of arms in the name of ceasefire.        
	Dera today said the condition of arms surrender could be negotiated if and only if both Delhi and Dispur gave serious, sincere and fait-hful assurance to discuss the outfits main demand of a separate homeland for Karbis.        
	We will surrender arms but for that the Centre and state will have to give us assurance that our self-ruled homeland (Hemprek Kanthim) issue will be seriously considered, Dera said.        
	A leader of an organisation representing Hindi-speaking people in the district said, Nobody wants a revival of the 2007 bloodbath.        
	With a population of more than 50,000, the Hindi-speaking people play a big role in the socio-economic as well as the political sphere of Karbi Anglong. These migrants usually work in sugarcane fields in the western part of the district.        
	The KLNLF emerged in 2001 as a faction of the United Peoples Democratic Solidarity, led jointly by Harsing Timung and Wilingson Timung who refused to accept the ceasefire.                    
	The faction, which was initially called the UPDS (anti-talks), later took on the name of KLNLF.        
	The organisation established a working relationship with the 27 battalion of Ulfa and carried out a series of attacks in the district.        
	The KLNLF had called a unilateral ceasefire for 75 days from January this year and also sought a political solution to their demands.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Mamata on board 
                                                                                                           Mamata on board

	May 20: Mamata Banerjee put the Congress leadership at ease today, initially expressing reluctance to join the cabinet but agreeing later and reassuring the ally that she would not like to play spoiler in ministry formation.        
	The Trinamul Congress leader, who met Sonia Gandhi separately after a UPA co-ordination committee meeting, conveyed to the Congress chief she would not up the portfolio ante but would not like to be seen as playing in a league below the DMK.        
	Mamata at one point suggested that she would personally like to continue her fight against the Left in Bengal but Ahmed Patel, Sonias political secretary, persuaded her to change her mind, sources said.        
	Patel told Mamata that her presence in the cabinet would add to the stability of the government. The Trinamul leader agreed but she continued to say she wanted to fight the Left, the sources added.        
	Other sources said there were six names on the tentative list of Trinamul ministers at the moment, including Mamata, Dinesh Trivedi, Kakoli Ghosh Dastidar, Sultan Ahmed, C.M. Jatua and Mukul Rai.        
	Of the six, Mamata was likely to be given railways and Trivedi an economic or infrastructure portfolio, they said. The others could be in line for minister of state berths in the human resource development, home and other ministries.        
	A Trinamul MLA in Calcutta said Mamata had told Sonia over phone yesterday that she expected at least six berths.        
	Today also she told Sonia the same thing. Our leaders contention is a reasonable number of ministerial berths will add weight to the party and enthuse its rank and file before next years civic elections and the 2011 Assembly polls, the MLA said.        
	According to Trinamul sources, the party is eyeing the railways, health, rural development, surface transport, steel and civil aviation portfolios. Mamata has apparently hinted she is not averse to a home MoS berth as it would help keep the ruling CPM government on a tight leash.        
	At the UPA meeting, Mamata made a strong case for a special package for minorities. She said they had reposed special faith in the UPA, so there was a greater need to protect them and try to weed out poverty and unemployment.        
	She trained guns on the Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee regime and said she wanted the 2011 Bengal Assembly elections brought forward.                     
	The sooner the Left Front goes, the better it will be for West Bengal. Nothing is moving in the state. Everything is at a standstill.        
	Mamata also met other UPA allies. She reportedly told Patel she wished to cooperate with the Congress and the UPA at every level.        
	On the talks Mamata held with Sonia, a Trinamul general secretary said they had been useful and smooth.        
	Didi had a one-on-one with Soniaji for about 10 minutes on possible portfolios. Our leader said Trinamul should get due recognition as the UPAs second largest constituent and that ministries should be allocated on the basis of strength. Soniaji told Didi that considering Trinamuls wishes should not be a problem.        
	Mamata earned a compliment of sorts from Pranab Mukherjee. In a TV interview, he said Bhattacharjee was a great man but the Congress would win the next Assembly elections and Mamata would be chief minister.

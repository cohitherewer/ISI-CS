          OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT                            Varun: In SC                                   
	New Delhi, April 2: The Supreme Court today sent notices to the Uttar Pradesh authorities asking them to justify Varun Gandhis detention under the draconian National Security Act (NSA).         
	Acting on a petition by Varun, a bench headed by Chief Justice K.G. Balakrishnan sought an explanation for the detention since March 29. The 29-year-old has been booked for alleged breach of peace and public order.        
	The bench also sent notices on Varuns plea for interim relief  release to file nomination and campaign as the BJP candidate in Pilibhit. The next hearing is on April 13, three days before the last date for filing nominations. Voting will take place on May 13.         
	Varuns counsel Mukul Rohtagi contended that the detention order, passed by the district magistrate, was bad in law.         
	The state government must under the law first record in writing the reasons for such an order and then delegate authority to the district magistrate to execute it, Rohtagi said. No such written order was passed, he claimed. The district magistrate has no independent power to pass such a detention order, Rohtagi said        
	Varun had gone to Pilibhit only to surrender last Saturday, Rohtagi said, and suggested he wasnt to blame for the arson that followed.         
	The poor boy just went to surrender. Five hundred people were already there. Hows the poor boy responsible (for all that followed)? Rohatgi said, pressing for his release.

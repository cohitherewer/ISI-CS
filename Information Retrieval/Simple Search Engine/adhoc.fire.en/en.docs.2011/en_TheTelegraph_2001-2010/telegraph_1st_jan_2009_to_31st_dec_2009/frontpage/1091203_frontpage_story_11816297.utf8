                                Lakshmi: Better naked                            
	Los Angeles, Dec. 2 (PTI): Celebrity chef and model Padma Lakshmi, who is six-months pregnant, bared it all for a New York magazine called Page Six.        
	On the cover of the magazine, the Top Chef hostess hugs her knees while looking at the camera over her right shoulder, reports celebrity gossip site www.Aceshowbiz.com.        
	In a photo spread inside the magazine, Padma copies a pose made famous by the Hannah Montana star, Miley Cyrus, for Vanity Fair.        
	I like me better naked. I dont mean that in a vain way ... When you put clothes on, you immediately put a character on. Clothes are adjectives, they are indicators. When you dont have any clothes on, its just you, raw, and you cant hide, the 39-year-old Lakshmi says in the magazine.        
	The star, who once was married to author Salman Rushdie, says that she is still re-assembling her life after their split in 2007.         
	I [have been] reconstructing my life and putting it back together in a way that looked more appropriate to who I was. At this point in my career, Im still growing. Jewels, spices and teas  I sound like Magellan, she says.

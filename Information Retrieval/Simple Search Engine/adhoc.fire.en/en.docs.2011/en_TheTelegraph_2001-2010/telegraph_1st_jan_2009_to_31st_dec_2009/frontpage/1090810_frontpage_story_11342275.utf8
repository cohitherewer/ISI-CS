The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Tree headache for Mamata
                                                                                                           Tree headache for Mamata
          SANJAY MANDAL                              
	Calcutta, Aug. 9: Mamata Banerjee will soon have to choose between a power project and trees.        
	The railways have found land for a thermal power plant, promised by Mamata in the budget, to help Purulias Adra but lakhs of trees have struck root in the 1,032 acres because of an afforestation programme.        
	A clause does exist that allows the railways to reclaim the forest land but two ticklish matters lie ahead. One, the railways will then need the acquiescence of the forest department of the Left Front government.        
	Two  and more important  2.5 lakh to 3 lakh trees will have to be felled if the land is chosen for the 1,000MW project. Chopping lakhs of trees will amount to an ecological genocide, more so for a leader who swears by Mother Earth and counts among her supporters several environment crusaders.        
	The Trinamul Congresss environmental opposition to the Nayachar chemical hub will also be called into question if the trees are sacrificed for an industrial project.        
	If all these moral issues are somehow reconciled, there still lurks a practical problem. The state has the capacity to clear trees on only 50 acres a year but the railways need between 800 and 1,000 acres.        
	The land, lying adjacent to a Territorial Army camp, was a barren stretch about 15 years ago but was converted into a forest after it was leased out to the state-run department as part of an environment drive. In 2008, the lease was extended by another 10 years.         
	A survey by the railways and the National Thermal Power Corporation (NTPC) found the land ideal for the project because of its proximity to water sources. The Darakeswar river flows nearby, and the Damodar Valley Corporations dams at Mython and Panchet are around 25km away.         
	There is no other big stretch in the vicinity and if this land cannot be retrieved, we will have to look up to the state government, a railway official said.        
	But railway officials in Delhi said the procedure of identifying the land would be completed soon.         
	Once the land is identified, an environment impact assessment will be carried out by the railways and the NTPC. The railways will also have to sign an agreement with Coal India for supplying fuel to the plant. A plant usually takes around three years to complete after getting the final clearance.        
	Mamata, however, told a meeting in East Midnapore today that the railways had a land bank of 1.12 lakh acres across the country. We have a lot of land in our bank to implement projects in Bengal. In Adra, we have 800 acres for the power plant. We dont need to acquire land, she said.

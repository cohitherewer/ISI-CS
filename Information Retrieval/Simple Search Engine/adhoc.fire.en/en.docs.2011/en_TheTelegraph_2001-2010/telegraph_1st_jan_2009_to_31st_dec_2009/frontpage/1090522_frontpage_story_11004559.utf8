          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                               Yechury, Karat: War of articles				                                 
	New Delhi, May 21: Simmering differences in the CPM on pushing the third front as an alternative secular formation at the Centre appear to be boiling over into the open.        
	They come reflected in two pieces to appear in the forthcoming issue of the party mouthpiece, Peoples Democracy  one an editorial, which Sitaram Yechury usually writes as editor, and the other a longer, signed piece by party general secretary Prakash Karat.        
	The divergences are subtle and essentially located in their respective emphases, but they may well represent the basis on which internal debate over future political strategy will develop.         
	Neither leader disagrees with the third front formulation as political strategy. But whereas Karat has made an elaborate defence of the third fronts prospects even though the idea has been drubbed, Yechury delivered it an editorial snub.        
	The CPI(M) had all along, in the Political Resolutions of successive Party Congresses, articulated the need for the creation of a third political alternative that can effect a progressive shift in the policy trajectory of the country. Such an alternative cannot, obviously, be a cut-and-paste arrangement on the eve of elections. This can only emerge through sustained popular struggles. There are no short-cuts, the editorial said.              
	Karat, on the other hand, underlined the unanimous decision of the party central committee in Kochi to strive for a third front and struck a far more optimistic note on the future of the line.         
	There have been two consequences of the projection of a third front. Firstly, the BJP-led NDA was adversely affected by the formation of a non-Congress secular combination. The BJP and the NDAs tally has come down since they were denied any significant ally in the states of Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh and Orissa. The second point to be noted is that the secular non-Congress combination has got 21 per cent of the vote and this shows the potential for building up a third alternative on the lines suggested by the CPI(M) in its Party Congress. That is, an alternative which is not merely an electoral alliance but a coming together of the parties and forces on a common platform through movements and struggles for alternative policies distinct from that of the Congress and the BJP.        
	The CPM general secretary, under attack from various quarters within the party for breaking with the UPA, also iterated that the Congress and the BJP had together secured less than 50 per cent (47.39 per cent) of the vote share --- his way of saying that if worked on, there is space for a credible and viable third front in the polity.        
	Yechury, on the other hand, clearly seemed to pull the other way, putting a question mark on the reliability of third front partners outside the Left fold.        
	Both the BSP, which declared pre-elections that it would be with a non-Congress, non-BJP combination, and the JD(S), which hosted the first public rally announcing the non-Congress, non-BJP combination in Karnataka, have decided to support the UPA. Even before the results were announced, the TRS which was part of a non-Congress, non-BJP front in Andhra Pradesh, had joined the NDA. These developments have only confirmed the assessment made by the CPI(M) politburo in its statement on May 19, 2009, that these alliances forged in some states on the eve of the elections were not seen by the people as a credible and viable alternative at the national level. quot;         
	Karats piece agreed with the failure to project a cohesive third front, but only in part --- his take on why it lacked credibility was different.        
	While Yechury hinted (without putting it in as many words) that taking ideological cohesion beyond the Left is a tough proposition because of the nature of parties and personalities that populated the third front, Karat located the problem in issues of relevance and projection. The electoral combination, Karat said of the third front, which were forged state-wise, precluded any national policy programme being projected.        
	Both CPM spearheads stressed the need to introspect the worst electoral debacle the party has suffered in four decades.        
	But Yechury sounded the more urgent: In the first elections that the CPI(M) contested, in 1967, after the battle against revisionism in the Indian communist movement and the formation of the Party in 1964, it had won 19 seats. In these elections, we have won only 16. All the four Left parties together have won only 24 seats. This requires a serious self-critical introspection and review in order to identify the mistakes and shortcomings and to draw proper lessons. This is absolutely necessary to regain the support and confidence of those sections of the people who have been alienated from the Left and to further consolidate and expand its influence in the future. This process has begun, Yechury wrote.

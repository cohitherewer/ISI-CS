          OUR BUREAU                              
	Calcutta, Jan. 30: Guess whos teaching Manmohan Singh a thing or two about how to run the economy?         
	The Bengal CPM, which has discovered overnight that populism is a dirty word and has refused to pass on the full price relief on motor oil the Centre announced on Wednesday night.        
	The state government did buckle a bit under pressure today, nipping the tax on diesel so that Calcutta gets a relief of Re 1 on the fuel and announcing lower taxi and bus fares.         
	But Calcutta still has to be content with half of the relief (Rs 2) the rest of India enjoys on diesel, and petrol has been left unattended by the state governments benevolence.        
	Such a stern financial visage showed an unfamiliar face of the Left Front government that has grown up on a regular diet of populism and mouthfuls of criticism of the Centre for daring to raise prices.        
	Finance minister Asim Dasgupta, whose department was so eager to nip populism in its bud that it issued an order to raise taxes a fortnight before the Centre granted the relief, cited economic compulsions  something his government and party did not show much regard for as long as it was Delhis problem.        
	Today, Dasgupta was at pains to explain how the state exchequer had to bear the burden of nearly Rs 400 crore because of a tax rebate unveiled in June last year and the latest diesel relief announced today.        
	We are at the end of the current financial year and a lot of development work is left to be done. We are also concerned over the financial burden the state government will have to bear because of implementation of the fifth pay commission for 10 lakh employees. To tide over a resource crunch, we had to revert to the sales tax structure, Dasgupta said.        
	If anyone had any doubt, the wizard of many a puzzling budget added in good measure: All this had been done in consultation with the chief minister.        
	Chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjees valiant efforts at economic prudence have not been lost on his party either. We have to think of the states economy also as sales tax is the main source of its revenue, Benoy Konar, CPM state secretariat member, said.        
	What does Konar think of the Centres decision to reduce domestic oil prices when global prices crashed? People are not fools. They understand well that the Centres move was aimed at the coming polls.        
	But Dasgupta wont mind some more of such foolishness if it comes at the cost of the Centre.        
	The Union government should reduce the prices further. That will offset to some extent our move to raise sales tax. It has to be kept in mind that the price per barrel of oil is about a fourth of what it used to be in June last year. Has there been a commensurate decline in prices? For that, I am prepared to incur a revenue loss, Dasgupta said.        
	Are you prepared, Prime Minister?

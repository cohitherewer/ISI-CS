The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | VC comes looking for campus
                                                                                                           VC comes looking for campus
          AMIT GUPTA                               
	Ranchi, March 7: The site for the new Central University in Jharkhand is yet to be finalised, but its newly-appointed vice-chancellor wants to start classes from July.        
	D.T. Khathing, the former registrar of North Eastern Hill University (NEHU) and a professor in physics, arrived here on Thursday to scout for a temporary campus and set in motion the appointment of faculty (six in each subject) and other administrative heads like a registrar, dean of students welfare and proctor, among others.        
	Khathing, whose name was announced along with other vice-chancellors of the 12 proposed central universities before the Election Commission came out with the Lok Sabha election schedule, said: I want classes to begin for the 2009-10 academic session.        
	In Ranchi, the vice-chancellor (VC) has been holding talks with several academics, including Ranchi University (RU) VC A.A. Khan, to find out the nature of courses (both undergraduate and postgraduate) that would be relevant here. Sources said Khathing had been advised to start a five-year integrated law course and several vocational courses at undergraduate and postgraduate levels.         
	We would normally admit 60 and 30 students in each undergraduate and postgraduate subject, respectively. But we will begin by setting up a few departments only, he said.         
	The Central University in Jharkhand, among the 15 proposed to be set up by the UPA government (12 new and three existing varsities are to be upgraded) has also been authorised to grant affiliations to colleges/institutions on the proposal of respective state governments.         
	The move to have the Central University housed at a permanent campus would hopefully gain ground after classes begin in July. A team of the Union human resources ministry visited Jharkhand in February to inspect the proposed sites for the varsity.        
	Over 200 acre would be required and the choice had now narrowed down to three places  Khunti, Piska Nagar (attached to the Birsa Agriculture University) and Bokaro district.        
	A central team is scheduled to visit the state again this month to freeze on one.

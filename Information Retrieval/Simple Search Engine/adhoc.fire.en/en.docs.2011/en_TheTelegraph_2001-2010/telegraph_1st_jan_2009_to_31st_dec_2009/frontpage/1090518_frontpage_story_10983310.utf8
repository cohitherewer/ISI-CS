The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Left culprits: front failure amp; disconnect
                                                                                                           Left culprits: front failure amp; disconnect
          JAYANTH JACOB                            Prakash Karat (top) , AB Bardhan: soul searching                                 
	New Delhi, May 17: The Left parties today began a soul-search into their electoral rout, with general secretary Prakash Karat cajoling all to speak up freely and frankly.        
	Still stunned by the unprecedented drubbing, the parties zeroed in on two main factors that may have done them in: the failure of the third front and the disconnect between local leaders and the electorate, especially in Bengal.        
	Sources said Forward Bloc leader G. Devarajan was categorical that the Lefts failure to project the third front as a credible secular alternative to the Congress and the BJP was one of the main reasons for the defeat.        
	Neither did the alternative have a common vision nor had it put up enough shows of strength together, he is believed to have said. According to sources, many leaders, including a representative from the CPM, seconded him.        
	Another thing that came in for flak was the way the CPM behaved with smaller partners, especially in Kerala. RSP general secretary T.J. Chandrachoodan reportedly said the CPM had the tendency to unfairly snatch seats as though it were the only party capable of winning elections.        
	There was also criticism about the decision to allow PDP chief Abdul Naser Madani to share the dais with Left leaders during electioneering. Some felt it had caused Muslim votes to shift to the Congress and its partner, the Indian Union Muslim League.        
	When the discussion moved to Bengal, sources said the glare was on the party-voter disconnect and the fact that Muslim votes had returned to the Congress fold despite the Left playing up the anti-US card.        
	We all know there is a huge gap between the local leaders and the electorate. Many Left and CPM workers seem to have voted for the Opposition. And it doesnt help the Left cause if the CPM leadership in Bengal thinks that allies dont matter, a general secretary of one of the parties said later.        
	Asked if he had said as much at the meeting, he replied: We conveyed the message loud and clear.        
	Some central leaders questioned whether the Lefts split with the UPA had indirectly helped the Congress and the Trinamul Congress to come together and trigger the debacle in Bengal.        
	I dont think so. They were in alliance earlier too. But this time there was a context (Nandigram and Singur), and our machinery failed to counter it. We need to get our act together ahead of the Assembly elections, Debabrata Biswas, the general secretary of the All India Forward Bloc, said.        
	Another leader said: The basic arithmetic is that if the Trinamul and the Congress come together, they have the numbers advantage.        
	But in hindsight we also failed in tactics. We couldnt convince people that we are the secular alternative to the Congress. Then, the CPM refused to read the writing on the wall after the panchayat poll setback in Bengal. Now they will.

                                                                                                           Coke and Knights seal deal 
          SAMYABRATA RAY GOSWAMI                              
	Mumbai, Feb. 18: Shah Rukhs sprightly knights have a new deal to sip from.        
	Coca-Cola today announced it would be an associate sponsor of Kolkata Knight Riders, the Indian Premier League team owned by the actor and his friends, for three years, starting this season.         
	The deal came after KKRs talks with Coke rival PepsiCo fizzled out.         
	We had a meeting with PepsiCo yesterday evening after which we decided that there was no point expecting much from them. Coke was making a much better offer as per their letter of intent. It was a multi-year deal  so we picked Coke, said a KKR source.         
	Pepsi was the associate sponsor and beverage partner of KKR last year.         
	PepsiCo, which did not renew its endorsement contract with Shah Rukh after a decade-long association, had been willing to offer a golden handshake to the superstar in the form of a sponsorship for his IPL team.         
	Sources said the three-year deal with Coca-Cola  which would promote Sprite (the clear lemon drink)  would fetch KKR around Rs 5 crore annually.        
	From the time of its inception last year, Kolkata Knight Riders has far exceeded the expectation of competitors and compatriots in terms of our fan following and the success of our brand and business. With Sprite now on board as associate sponsor and official pouring partner, I am confident we will together provide more enhanced experiences to our fans and consumers, making IPL 2009 all the more action-packed and exciting, said Jai Mehta, co-owner of the Knight Riders.        
	PepsiCo did not comment on the development. But sources said it wasnt ready to offer more than a one-year contract, worth around Rs 4 crore.        
	As part of the new deal, Sprite will be the official beverage of the Calcutta team.        
	Twenty20 cricket is clearly a growing passion with todays youth. The success of IPL 2008 has taken the game to a new high. It provides Coca-Cola India with a very exciting platform to connect with all its consumers. We are happy to bat with Kolkata Knight Riders as an associate sponsor and pouring partner, said Venkatesh Kini, vice-president (marketing), Coca-Cola India.        
	Coke will get branding rights for Sprite on players apparel (leading arm) as well as on the helmet.        
	The KKR partnership will further help entrench the brand among consumers not only in Bengal but across India. As part of the association, Sprite will have in-stadia presence and activation rights for all seven home matches at Eden Gardens, Indias most loved cricketing venue, said Coke spokesperson Viraj Chauhan.

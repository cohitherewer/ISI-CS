The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Auto rioters have free run
                                                                                                           Auto rioters have free run
          OUR BUREAU                                        
	Calcutta, Jan. 3: Auto drivers rampaged in the city for the second day running, torching three state buses, stoning vehicles and forcing passengers out of taxis.        
	The police officially said the violence occurred during an agitation by Trinamul Congress members and supporters. But off the record, officers would not rule out participation by a section of Citu supporters since the majority of auto drivers owe allegiance to the CPM labour wing.        
	No autos were seized today since there was an auto and taxi strike and the law-keepers stayed away from trouble spots.        
	The hub of the violence was Park Circus, from where 11 people were arrested on non-bailable charges, said joint commissioner of police Pradip Chatterjee.        
	This came hours after Trinamul chief Mamata Banerjee squatted through the night at the Broad Street-Bondel Road crossing, 1km from chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjees residence, demanding release of the 16 arrested during yesterdays violence. She left at 4am.        
	The 16 were, however, produced in court, which vindicated the police action by remanding them in judicial custody till January 12. They have been booked for rioting with deadly weapons, deterring a public servant from his duty, damaging government property, etc, Chatterjee said.        
	This morning, the protesters turned violent around 9.30am at the Park Circus crossing. Some of them rushed towards a taxi coming from the direction of Bridge No. 4 and dragged the driver out. Two stick-wielding men climbed on the bonnet and the others threatened the two passengers and ordered them out, said resident Mansur Akhtar.         
	A group of 15 youths emerged from the stairs on the bridges side and stopped a state bus. Panicky passengers jumped off as the protesters stoned and then torched it. They were hurling abuses. Suddenly, a window was smashed. The children in the bus were crying in fear, said passenger Subhojit Das. Buses were set on fire also near the AJC Bose Road flyover.

                                                                                                           Democracys right to disfigure at your door
          A STAFF REPORTER                                              
	Calcutta, Feb. 25: If you believe in democracy, better take a degree in chemistry.        
	Paint that can be washed off easily with water and soap can be dabbed on the wall of your house for poll graffiti so that the worlds largest democracy cuts a pretty picture when it holds general elections in two months.        
	The state election commission today formally announced a relaxation of the blanket graffiti ban on private houses it had bravely championed in October last year.        
	The ritual checks and balances are in place, including a rule that parties should seek house owners written permission . But in a state and country where little protection is available to the individual against the collective muscle power of political parties, it is anybodys guess how many people will dare refuse permission to disfigure their walls.        
	The poll panel had announced the blanket ban in October precisely because of this realisation  it is better to root out the threat to individual freedom rather than attach conditions that could be arm-twisted to irrelevance.        
	However, it forgot to take into account political parties which unanimously lobbied against the ban. The concession was communicated to the parties at an all-party meeting at chief electoral officer Debashis Sens office today afternoon.        
	Asked whether the decision was a big shift from the October assertion, Sen said: One can interpret it that way, but the decision came from the Centre.        
	So, next time the para painter knocks on your door, be prepared to sample the paint and determine for yourself whether soap, water or any other cleansing agent will be required to remove it later.        
	Officials in the poll panel, who should know a thing or two about indelibility, have offered a helping hand: lime-based paint or water colours can apparently be scrubbed without much toil.        
	Many Calcuttans felt deceived and voiced their discontent. We are very disappointed. The clause of taking approval from house owners is a farce because almost everyone is forced to comply for fear of earning the wrath of local political goons. The commission has let us down, said Amar Mitra, the president of the All Calcutta Houseowners Association.        
	The walls of my house are going to get soiled yet again. The commission was not expected to cower before political pressure, said Dipankar Ghosh, 58, who lives in north Calcutta.        
	Its very discouraging for the environmental health of the city. Its an unhealthy decision that would lead to more visual pollution, said environment activist Subhash Dutta.        
	Politicians, however, welcomed the decision. In a democratic system, rights and privileges of candidates shouldnt be curbed. If curbs introduced by the commission obstruct communication, it will be detrimental to parliamentary democracy, said Manas Bhunia of the Congress.        
	On graffiti, political rivals are bedfellows. CPMs Rabin Deb said: The poll panel should not have problems if house owners allow graffiti. We find nothing wrong with that.         
	The panel has also assured parties that a sympathetic view would be taken in implementing the ban on using premises of educational institutions for campaign.        
	But the commission has offered protection to clothes. Caps or scarves with symbols or captions may be used but not on apparel. The parties have agreed to abide by the order, Sen said.

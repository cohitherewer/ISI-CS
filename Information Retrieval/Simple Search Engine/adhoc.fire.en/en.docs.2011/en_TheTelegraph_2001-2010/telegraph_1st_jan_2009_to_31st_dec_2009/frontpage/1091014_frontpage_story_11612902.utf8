                                                                                                           Arunachal vote high, China salvo at PM
          OUR BUREAU                                              
	Oct. 13: China has used unusually harsh language to condemn Prime Minister Manmohan Singhs 10-day-old visit to Arunachal Pradesh without naming him on a day the state clocked the highest-ever turnout in its Assembly polls.        
	China expresses its strong dissatisfaction on the visit by the Indian leader to the disputed area in disregard of Chinas grave concerns, Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Ma Zhaoxu said.        
	Beijing did not name the Prime Minister  both Manmohan Singh and finance minister Pranab Mukherjee had visited Arunachal to campaign for the elections  but the reference to the leader leaves little doubt on the target of Chinas ire.        
	We urge the Indian side to take Chinas solemn concerns seriously and do not stir up trouble at the disputed area with a view to ensuring the sound development of China-India relations, the Chinese statement said.         
	The spokesperson noted China and India had never officially settled the demarcation of their border, and that Beijings stand on the eastern section of the border was consistent and clear-cut.        
	China has staked claim to Arunachals entire 90,000sqkm of land. India maintains that China is illegally occupying 43,180sqkm of Jammu and Kashmir.        
	In response to the Chinese statement that was issued a few hours after polling commenced in Arunachal, New Delhi asserted that the state was an integral part of India, period.        
	External affairs minister S.M. Krishna said: Arunachal Pradesh is an integral part of India. We rest at that. Regardless of what others have to say, it is the Government of Indias position that Arunachal Pradesh is an integral part of India. Period, Krishna said.        
	The Chinese statement does not help the process of ongoing negotiations between the two governments on the boundary question, the external affairs ministry said in a statement.        
	Ambassador Zhang Yan drove to South Block today and met the joint secretary in charge of China, Vijay Gokhale. Sources said though the Arunachal issue came up, the meeting had been scheduled earlier and the envoy was not summoned in response to the statement.        
	The latest Chinese statement is stronger than the one it had issued when the Prime Minister had visited Arunachal in February.        
	China had then said: Regarding Mr Singhs visit to that area (Arunachal Pradesh), we have expressed our concern. Our position (on the issue) is clear. We hope that China and India will continue with consultations and negotiations which is good for peace and stability of the region. I believe both China and India are aware of this.        
	The statement then had expressed concern, not strong dissatisfaction as was the case today.         
	Recent debates in India over border incursions, the Dalai Lamas proposed visit to Arunachal and Indias refusal to allow a Chinese language programme are said to be the reasons behind the sudden high pitch.        
	The timing of the Chinese statement  it came 10 days after the Prime Minister visited the state  also raised eyebrows in Delhi.        
	India had also strongly protested Chinas move to issue special visas to Kashmiris, which gave the impression that Beijing was keeping ally Pakistans concerns in mind while dealing with India.        
	Sources said the fear of high turnout in Arunachal  the day ended with 74 per cent, higher than that during the Lok Sabha polls and highest in state polls  also might have prompted China to raise its voice.        
	The turnout could be interpreted as an acceptance among a wide swathe of the voters that they are part of India. However, there have been allegations that several voters were lured to booths by cash payments by some political parties.

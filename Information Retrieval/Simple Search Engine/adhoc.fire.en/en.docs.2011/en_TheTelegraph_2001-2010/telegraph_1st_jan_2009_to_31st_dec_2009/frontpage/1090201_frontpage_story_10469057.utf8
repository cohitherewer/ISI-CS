The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | PC wants state to act on red threat
                                                                                                           PC wants state to act on red threat
          SUDHIR KUMAR MISHRA                              
	Ranchi, Jan. 31: Union home minister P. Chidambaram today clarified that states should formulate a surrender policy for Maoists, who would, however, be rehabilitated by the Centre once they want to join social mainstream.        
	Chidambaram admitted that the Naxalites had spread their tentacles in different states and their modus operandi too was very complicated. But in the same vein, he also argued that in the federal structure, the states should work out their own surrender policies.         
	A national policy is not the need of the hour. A policy evolved by the state, keeping the requirements of its own geographical area in mind, often proves more effective as it is in the case of Andhra Pradesh, he said.        
	Chidambaram was here to get first-hand accounts of the steps being taken by the state government to curb Left-wing extremism and the problems being faced by officials posted in the fields.         
	He held a review meeting with Governor Syed Sibtey Razi, his advisers G. Krishnan, Sunila Basant and T.P. Sinha, among other senior government officials.        
	Maintaining that Jharkhands surrender policy too was ready and it would be executed soon, he said it was attractive and would motivate even the hardcore rebels to shun violence and return to the social mainstream.        
	During his first visit to the state since he became the home minister late last year, Chidambaram said that 145 police stations in Jharkhand were Naxalite affected and over 25 blocks did not have police stations.         
	Incidents of Maoist violence rose up during 2007-08, which took a toll on several police personnel and common civilians. However, during the current financial year, the men in uniform engaged in fighting out Naxalism seem to have gained an upper hand, he added.        
	On January 7, we had a meeting with chief ministers of all the Maoist-hit states. The meeting was also attended by the chief secretaries and directors-general of police of the states. The minutes of this meeting have already been circulated. I cannot discuss everything in public, but let me assure that inter-state joint operations against the Naxalites would be taken care of. I will also talk to the Bengal government and redress Jharkhands complaints about joint operations, he added.        
	On the current political impasse in the state, Chidambaram said that it was for the political parties to decide in which direction they wanted to go. If no one is able to form a government soon, the Centre would be forced to dissolve the Assembly, he said.         
	The advisers to the governor are well known and seasoned administrators. Naxalism cannot be wiped out overnight. But these wise people have long experience of working in Jharkhand and they would work out viable solutions under the governors supervision, he said.        
	A Congress delegation, led by state Congress general secretary Sailesh Sinha and senior leader Madan Mohan Sharma, met the Union home minister at the airport and asked him to continue the central rule for the benefit of the state people.        
	We told him that the people of Jharkhand are happy under Presidents rule, Sinha said.

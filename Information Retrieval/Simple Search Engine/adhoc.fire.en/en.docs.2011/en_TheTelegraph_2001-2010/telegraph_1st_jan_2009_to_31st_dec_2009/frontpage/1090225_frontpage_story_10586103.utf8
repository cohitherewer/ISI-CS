          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                            KP Singhdeo                                  
	Bhubaneswar, Feb. 24: Indira Gandhi zindabad (Long live Indira Gandhi) is fine, but not KP Singhdeo zindabad.        
	This weird rule to  or not to  raise slogans was put into force by none other than Singhdeo himself, as the state Congress chief felt this would instil discipline among party workers in the faction-ridden Orissa unit in the run-up to the coming general elections.        
	According to the partys code of conduct finalised weeks before the Election Commission announces dates of the Lok Sabha polls, organising lavish rallies or meetings has also been banned.        
	Except Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, the lone non-Gandhi leader to feature on Singhdeos tight list, a partyman could not raise slogans in praise of any other leader during poll rallies, said Pradesh Congress Committee spokesperson Arya Gyanendra.         
	This will ensure discipline and avoid chaos at any meeting or rally, he said, adding the set of directives had been issued to all district units.        
	No name of any state leader, including Singhdeo, was included in the list of persons for whom zindabad slogans were allowed, another party leader told PTI. The coveted list included former prime ministers Indira Gandhi and Rajiv Gandhi, Sonia Gandhi, Rahul Gandhi and of course the prime ministerial nominee, Manmohan Singh.        
	A senior party leader confided that the new leadership was prompted to restrict sloganeering to stop promotion of factional leaders in the state unit. At a rally in Deogarh on February 19, Singhdeo was visibly irritated when some party workers raised slogans only in favour of Youth Congress state president Rohit Pujari. He even asked Pujari publicly to ask his followers to stop shouting.         
	However, several party leaders questioned the curbs on raising slogans. In a democracy, its quite natural that a leader will have his followers. How can you check their emotional urge? asked a senior leader.        
	At places like Badchana in Jajpur district, followers of two rival factions clashed with each other during a visit by Singhdeo. Both groups ended up lodging complaints against each other at the local police station, prompting the PCC chief to leave without addressing the gathering.        
	Our state president has also advised partymen not to waste energy and money in organising extravagant rallies. Instead, he favours reaching out to people with the partys message, said Gyanendra.

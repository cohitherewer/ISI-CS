          OUR BUREAU                              
	Shillong/ New Delhi, Jan. 3: The Prime Minister today said he hoped Pakistan would have the sense to hand over those behind the Mumbai carnage amid reports that the US was mounting pressure on Islamabad to act.         
	I reiterate that Pakistan should hand over the masterminds of the Mumbai attacks at the earliest so that they can face trial in India, Manmohan Singh said after inaugurating the Indian Science Congress in Shillong.        
	In the past week, media reports have said Washington has handed Islamabad tapes proving Lashkar-e-Toiba leader Zakiur Rehman Lakhvis involvement in the Mumbai attacks. The Wall Street Journal reported that another Pakistan-based Lashkar leader, Zarar Shah, has confessed to his outfits role in the attacks.        
	Islamabad, however, had yesterday refused to extradite any suspects and said that if India gave concrete proof, it would try them in Pakistan.        
	India has not given up hope (of the suspects extradition) and we think that better sense will prevail as Pakistan also recognises that terrorism is a menace, Singh said.        
	There is demand from all civilised countries that the culprits should be brought to book and Pakistan should co-operate.        
	Singh, however, ruled out declaring war to achieve Indias demand, saying: War is not a solution.        
	In Delhi, US ambassador David Mulford met home minister P. Chidambaram for a 40-minute discussion on the Mumbai investigations which, India claims, clearly show the hand of Pakistan-based terrorists.        
	Chidambaram told a TV channel he would soon be flying to the US and sources said the trip was part of Indias plans to share inf- ormation from the probe with countries  including China  that have some purchase over Pakistan.        
	Chinese vice-foreign minister He Yafei, who recently visited Pakistan and met its army chief, is to arrive in Delhi soon.        
	Singh, visiting the Northeast two days after suspected Ulfa bombings killed five in Guwahati, said home-grown terrorists and the Maoists were a growing menace.        
	We will take up the issue of (Northeast) insurgents taking refuge in Bangladesh with the new government.        
	Prime Minister-elect Sheikh Hasina Wajed has said she would not allow Bangladeshi soil to be used to launch militant attacks in neighbouring countries.

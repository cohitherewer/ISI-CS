          OUR CORRESPONDENT                               
	Ranchi, Aug. 29: When rebels struck yesterday at Digambar Mahtos house in Bundu and killed his daughter and three others, they were actually looking for Dhananjay Singh Munda, a Maoist who they believed had turned police informer.        
	Mundas wife, Budhni Devi, was among those killed when at least 25 armed rebels opened fire on the house in the dead of night before daybreak on Friday, barely 500 metres away from the Bundu police station.        
	Munda, who neighbours say was missing since the last two days from the village, deserted the Maoists two years ago. After leaving the fold, he had continued to collect levy from various people in the area in the name of Maoists. This infuriated rebels and they came looking for him in the house where he was living with his family as tenants, said a terrified Bundu villager among the many who were yet to recover from the shock and trauma of the attack.        
	Sources in the police also confirmed that Munda had become a most wanted for the Maoists who suspected he had also turned police informer, just as they believed that all those living in Mahtos house were friends of the police.        
	Mahtos statement, on the basis of which the police lodged an FIR, also said he and his family were targeted as the Maoists believed he was close to police informers.        
	Apart from Mundas wife Budhni Devi, the rebels also killed Mahtos 12-year-old daughter Reeta Kumari  his younger daughter, nine-year-old beauty Kumari has been admitted to Rajendra Institute of Medical Sciences (RIMS) in Ranchi with serious injuries  and two 20-year-old students of Panch Pargania Kisan College, Vijay Pramanik and Pradeep Kumar Mahto also living there as tenants.        
	The police, who were finding it difficult to field criticism of their ineffectiveness even though jawans were only 500 metres away at the local police station at the time of the attack, have so far drawn a blank in their investigations.        
	While a fear psychosis seemed to have gripped the entire Bundu-Tamar region, the police suspect rebels may repeat such attacks in the region in the coming days as they have become aggressive after the arrests of several Maoists.        
	Recent arrests of rebels including some top leaders have made them very aggressive. Through these killings, they are showing their prowess and in all likelihood, they would repeat such attacks, said Anup T. Mathew, the rural SP of Ranchi.

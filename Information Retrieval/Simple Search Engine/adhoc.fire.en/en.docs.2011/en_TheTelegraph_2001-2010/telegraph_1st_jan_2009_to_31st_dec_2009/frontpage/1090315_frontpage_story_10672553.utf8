  - BJP ELECTION BOSS STICKS TO GUNS IN ROW          SANJAY K. JHA                            (From left) Arun Jaitley, Sushma Swaraj, Jaswant Singh, LK Advani and Rajnath Singh at the release of the BJPs IT vision document in Delhi on Saturday.

	New Delhi, March 14: Arun Jaitley appeared to be standing firm today, Sudhanshu Mittal seemed to be relishing his sudden rise to fame, and the BJP brass stayed silent.        
	The atmosphere remained tense a day after Jaitley exposed party fault-lines by staying away from the election committee over businessman Mittals appointment by party chief Rajnath Singh as co-in-charge of Assam affairs.        
	There were enough signals, though, that both sides were sticking to their guns.        
	Sources said Rajnath was in no mood to reverse his decision; Jaitley aides asserted he would not attend the BJP central election committees meetings. Jaitley, however, has said he would continue to function as chief campaign manager.        
	He created a flutter today by walking into a function where L.K. Advani and Rajnath were to release the partys IT vision document.        
	Jaitley, who arrived late, quietly sat beside the dais. Cameramen spotted him after some time and, when the document was being formally released, raised a chorus of: Jaitleyji ko upar bulao, Jaitleyji ko upar bulao (call Jaitley on stage).        
	The leader looked grim and declined to climb onto the dais. Spokesperson Ravi Shankar Prasad, however, promptly vacated his seat on the dais and requested him to come up.        
	Aware that refusal would fuel controversy, Jaitley came up and sat quietly. Sushma Swaraj exchanged a few words with him but Rajnath did not. Jaitley was the first to walk out when the programme ended.        
	Advani, Rajnath, Sushma and Jaswant Singh chose not to speak to the media about the controversy but their aides, speaking on condition of anonymity, were not so shy.        
	The Jaitley camp insisted he would continue to oppose wrong decisions and that his stand did not arise out of personal whims. Others raised questions about the timing of his protest and the damage it had done to the partys image.        
	Some spoke of discrepancies in the selection of candidates in Uttar Pradesh. Jaitley apparently felt Rajnath was pushing the wrong people for extraneous reasons. Rajnath aides denied this, claiming Jaitley was fighting a personal battle to establish his supremacy in the party.        
	Sources said the bickerings had left Advani dismayed.        
	Mittal, however, seemed to be lapping up the media attention. He protested his innocence and asked Jaitley to clarify what the issue was between them.        
	Kahan Raja Bhoj, kahan Gangu Teli, he said, implying Jaitley was too big a figure to have any problems with a minor official like him.        
	He said: I have been in the party for 30 years. I began as a youth activist, became a national council member in 1984, and have been directly involved in every election the party has fought since then. Suddenly, what is the problem with my image?        
	Mittal said he and Jaitley had gone to the same school and college, and that he had never had any personal issues with the lawyer.        
	I got the chance to become Delhi University Students Union president with Jaitleys blessings, Mittal said. I am a full-time politician. I have expertise in election management; I am not an outsider businessman who is bribing his way into the party.

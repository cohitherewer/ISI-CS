The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Polanski urges Swiss court to release him
                                                                                                           Polanski urges Swiss court to release him
                                Polanski: Hard time                            
	Zurich, Sept. 29 (AP): Lawyers for Roman Polanski filed a motion in court today asking that the director be released from Swiss custody  the first step in his legal battle to avoid extradition to the US for a 1977 statutory rape case.        
	The Swiss Federal Criminal Court announced the filing and said the decision will be made within the next few weeks. That statement meant Polanski was not expected to be freed anytime soon from prison, as he would stay incarcerated through the verdict and through any appeal from either side. That criminal court will decide on the legality of the American request for Polanskis apprehension, Swiss justice ministry spokesman Guido Balmer told The Associated Press today. He noted that the ministry and Polanski could later seek to overturn any decision at the Federal Tribunal, Switzerlands highest court.         
	We will examine the ruling and then decide what we will do, Balmer said, declining to speculate on if or when Polanski could get out of jail.        
	Polanskis French lawyer Herve Temime said the motion was filed by Swiss lawyers just hired by the director.        
	In most cases the imprisoned person has to remain in detention for the whole process, said Peter Cosandey, a former Zurich prosecutor specialising in international criminal cooperation.         
	The chances that he will be exempted from prison are rather small, he added, because Polanski is not a Swiss citizen or a permanent resident and is considered at high risk of fleeing justice.        
	Polanski, director of Chinatown, Rosemarys Baby and the Oscar-winning The Pianist was arrested on Saturday as he arrived in Zurich to receive a lifetime achievement award from a film festival.        
	Authorities in Los Angeles consider Polanski a convicted felon and fugitive, and a Swiss justice official said there has been an international arrest warrant out on him since 2005.        
	The director had pleaded guilty to unlawful sexual intercourse in 1977 with a 13-year-old girl. He was sent to prison for 42 days, but the judge tried to renege on the plea bargain. On the day of his sentencing in 1978, aware the judge would sentence him to more prison time, Polanski fled to France.        
	The Swiss justice ministry did not rule out the possibility that Polanski could be released on bail under very strict conditions that he doesnt flee Switzerland. Balmer said the court theoretically could confine Polanski to his chalet in the wealthy Swiss town of Gstaad, but noted that up to now there has never been a case of house arrest in such a situation.

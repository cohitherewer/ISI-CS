  - Satabdi tops apolitical Trinamul list          ANINDYA SENGUPTA                                                     
	Calcutta, Nov. 18: Kabir Sumans guitar is weeping tears of frustration but three fellow apolitical MPs have managed to loosen their purse strings.        
	Satabdi Roy, generally seen in the back rows of Parliament, takes the front bench in allocating money meant for local area development.        
	According to figures provided by the three apolitical representatives of the Trinamul Congress in the House, Satabdi has allocated or drawn up plans to spend Rs 1 crore in five months since the new House came into being  which works out to 50 per cent of the Rs 2 crore she is eligible in a year. (See chart)         
	The actress has some more months to spend another crore. The money left unspent, if any, after a year will go back to the Centre and cannot be rolled over along with the fresh allocation of Rs 2 crore for the next year.        
	Interference in spending the cash is the stated reason for Sumans outburst against some Trinamul Congress leaders. The singer today indicated that it was possible to sort out the differences.         
	Satabdi and the two others  actor Tapas Pal and doctor Kakoli Ghosh Dastidar  said they faced no problems in drawing up plans to spend the money. Let alone Mamatadi, no Trinamul leader interfered with the manner in which I am spending MPLAD funds, Satabdi said.        
	Local leaders of all political parties are known to pull strings or lobby for what they feel are important issues that need money urgently, and apolitical leaders are sometimes more vulnerable to such pressures than battle-hardened professional politicians.        
	Some MPs approve projects shortlisted by local advisers and send them to the executing agencies  the district magistrate, block development officer or the municipality concerned. After that, the MPLAD (local area development) money is disbursed.        
	The execution of Satabdis development fund is being looked after by Asis Banerjee, Trinamuls Rampurhat MLA. Satabdi has held several meetings with local people, clubs, social organisations and party leaders to assess their requirements. After that, she began earmarking funds, Banerjee said.        
	His statement suggests Satabdi is more active in her constituency than in Parliament. In the House, she has kept to herself and has not been noticed asking questions, though she was an eager participant in the budget debate. One of the issues she raised: an increase in MPLAD funding.        
	The areas in Birbhum, Satabdis constituency, that have till now benefited in terms of renovation of schools and deployment of ambulances include Rampurhat, Rajnagar, Bhabanandapur, Bautia and Suri, according to Banerjee.        
	After submitting the utilisation certificate of Rs 1 crore, she will be entitled to the remaining Rs 1 crore for this year, Banerjee added.        
	Satabdis fellow actor Pal, who makes himself heard in Parliament during protests staged by Trinamul, has so far spent Rs 41 lakh and lined up plans to use Rs 22 lakh more in Krishnagar. Barasat MP Kakoli said she had spent about Rs 30 lakh on ambulances and mobile dispensaries and finalised plans for another Rs 65 lakh.        
	Jadavpur MP Suman said till now, he had got half of the Rs 2 crore but did not specify the amount he has spent or earmarked so far. In my constituency, the main problems are bijli, sadak and pani (electricity, road and water). I have started addressing the water problem by boring deep tube-wells. Till now, boring of 44 deep tube-wells are in various stages of completion.         
	Barasat MP Kakoli said she intended to use the remaining Rs 65 lakh of the Rs 1 crore she has been sanctioned on infrastructure.        
	I came to know in September that Rs 1 crore of MPLAD fund had been deposited with the district administration. I had very little time to approve projects. Till then, Rs 30 lakh of work has been done in these two-and-a-half months, she added.        
	CPI veteran Gurudas Dasgupta, however, admitted that he was yet to start spending from his development fund. I have been told that Rs 1 crore has already arrived under (the) MPLAD (fund), the MP from Ghatal, West Midnapore, said. I will submit my plan of action and the projects by the end of this month. I hope to begin execution of the projects by December.        
	Dasgupta said that during his last stint as MP, he didnt keep any MPLAD money unspent.        
	With inputs from Charu Sudan Kasturi in New Delhi

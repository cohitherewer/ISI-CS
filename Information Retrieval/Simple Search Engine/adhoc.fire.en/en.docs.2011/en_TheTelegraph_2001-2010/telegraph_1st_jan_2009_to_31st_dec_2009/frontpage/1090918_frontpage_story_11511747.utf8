The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Class of wise guys? Brainwash them
                                                                                                           Class of wise guys? Brainwash them
          RASHEED KIDWAI                      Shashi Tharoor at home in the economy class on August 8. (Jay Mandal/On Assignment)                          
	Sept. 17: Oh Stephanians, forgive Shashi for he knows not what he has inflicted upon himself and you.        
	A senior  and stentorian  minister has volunteered to take classes for public school products and Ivy League-like alumni who also happen to be his colleagues in the Manmohan Singh government so that they do not fall prey to indiscretions like cracking a joke on Twitter.        
	Thought-provoking subjects are in the syllabus the minister has been drawing up since last night when the Congress decided it could not afford to be amused by junior foreign minister Shashi Tharoors tweet on cattle class and holy cows. A sample: parliamentary etiquette, a brief history of the long life of the Congress, role models and probity in public life.        
	The minister did not want to be named, perhaps worried that the humour police in the party may think it was a joke and do not take him seriously.         
	They (those prone to crack jokes) should be given a crash course in parliamentary etiquette, a brief history of the party, role models and probity in public life, the veteran minister told The Telegraph in all earnestness, adding that he would only be happy to take the responsibility of imparting the lessons upon himself.        
	If the stern stalwarts of the Congress do pursue the offer with tenacity, the minister can be assured of a full house waiting to be exorcised of that cancerous influence called humour.        
	Besides Tharoor, several Stephanians are now part of the central ministry. Age may have withered the wit of some of these Stephanians and custom may have staled the variety of a few others but there is a feeling in the Congress that an educated elite is responsible for striking at the root of the political correctness the party has been trying to affect for some time.        
	The Stephanians and public school products bring an element of gentle backslapping, wisecracks and cafe culture to the hard-nosed politics of Delhi. Besides Tharoor, the league includes Vir Bhadra Singh, Salman Khursheed, Kapil Sibal, Jitin Prasada, R.P.N. Singh, Sachin Pilot and Jyotiraditya Scindia.        
	The jokes that fly are always not meant to cut others to size. Sometimes it is deployed for self-deprecation, too. Khursheed, who has had a long history of getting defeated at the hustings, is known for saying it was in Stephens that he learnt how to lose elections. I lost my first election in Stephens and after that I have lost many.        
	Mani Shankar Aiyar, another alumnus who has lost a recent election, has such a reputation for demolishing egos that few tangle with him. Sample the repartee that must have struck Natwar Singh like a thunderbolt. (See chart above)        
	Aiyars acid is not reserved for politicians alone. When a fellow IFS officer from Tamil Nadu whom Aiyar couldnt stand got posted as Indias ambassador to Cyprus, the response: Oh him? Half a man posted to half a country.        
	However, is such ribbing and repartee becoming an endangered species in the Congress as it worries itself sick about what the so-called aam aadmi would think?        
	It appears so, judging by the reluctance to discuss such a harmless subject on record and the tendency to slip into grave matters such as public policy when asked about the need to pause once in a while and laugh at oneself.        
	Nobody has anything against humour itself but the party of the common man feels that sharing jokes with the masses is a no-no.        
	Many of Tharoors political peers agree he was well within his rights to say what he did in the manner he did, but most of them stress equally firmly that he should not have gone public with it.         
	As one Tharoor sympathiser - public school, suave, known for his wit and his yen for political gossip - put it: quot;As politicians, we all must realise the weight and the impact our public words have. We are all human and we all have our likes and dislikes and our ways of expressing them. The point is that the fact of being in the public space pl-a-c-es due restrictions on you. It is not merely about abiding by the disciplines of an organisation, it is also about how you are perceived in the public eye. To that extent, Tharoor appe-ars to have exceeded himself. quot;        
	Arun Jaitley of the BJP crisply agreed, without going into the rights and wrongs of Tharoors tweet: quot;His inexperience of dealing with India is probably showing. quot; Maybe, the minister preparing the course material should consult Jaitely, too.        
	Is the quot;deepening democr-a-cy quot; in the Congress erecting a culture ceiling between the public school products and the others?         
	Few will give a direct reply, preferring to replay the record of restraint in public. quot;We all love a good joke, and often you see flashes of it in Parliament or on the public stage, but there will always be lines people must respect, there is something called lok-laaj and you must have the sense and talent to recognise what you can say privately or for private consumption and what you want to put out in public with your name attached to it, quot; said a politician who proclaimed himself as the quot;very bright quot; Tharoors friend.        
	Others smelt conspiracies from which good old parties are never far off. quot;It (the campaign against Tharoor) is actually about UPA-IIs failure to come up with great ideas in its first 100 days, quot; said a minister. quot;It is just that 24 Akbar Road (the Congress party headquarters) is barren of ideas. The party is unable to provide any direction or inputs to the government. The party headquarters has earned a reputation as a breeding gr-ound for warring factions, intrigue and whispers, quot; he said.        
	In Britain, the land of iconoclastic humour where politicians are facing rough weather in the wake of an expenditure scandal, Tharoor will probably find some sympathy.        
	Gary Flather, a Queens Counsel well known in Indian circles since he is married to Shreela Flather, the first Asian woman to be elevated to the peerage, said: quot;People should not get too fussed about what Tharoor said. A sense of humour is extremely valuable. quot;        
	Perhaps in the highest traditions of Yes Minister, the epitome of poker-faced wit, the last word should be that of an official.        
	Tharoors officer on special duty, Jacob Joseph (not a bureaucrat, unlike Yes Ministers permanent secretary Sir Humphrey Appleby) tweeted today: quot;We are not a funny country. May be they should invite a cow to join the panel discussion on TV. quot;        
	WITH INPUTS FROM AMIT ROY IN LONDON, RADHIKA RAMASESHAN AND JAYANTH JACOB IN NEW DELHI

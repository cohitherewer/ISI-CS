The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | World Naga meet to evolve consensus
                                                                                                           World Naga meet to evolve consensus
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                               
	Kohima, Feb. 20: Nagas from across the world will converge in Kohima for a three-day consultative meeting in March to evolve a consensus on the political issue that has dogged the community for more than six decades.        
	The meeting, which is likely to be the largest peace drive initiated by the Nagaland government, comes after almost 12 years of the Centres ceasefire with the National Socialist Council of Nagalim (Isak-Muivah).        
	Organised under the political affairs committee of the state government, the meeting is slated for March 5 to 7.         
	The political affairs committee chairman, T.M. Lotha, said representatives from various political parties, apex Naga tribal organisations, NGOs, the Church and representatives from Naga militant groups will deliberate on the Naga conflict to find a way forward.        
	Nagas from the US, Japan, the UK, Canada and other countries will participate in the meeting, along with representatives of the various Naga organisations in the state and elsewhere in the country, he said.        
	Naga support groups like the Amsterdam-based Naga International Support Centre and people at the Washington DC office of the NSCN (I-M) have also expressed their desire to be part of the meeting.         
	Though the Centre is yet to give permission to these groups to visit Nagaland, the state government has already sent them invitations for the meeting.         
	With one dream, one future as the theme, the meeting aims at bringing Naga people from across diverse political and ideological backgrounds on a single platform.         
	But before the meet, a peace forum led by the church of the Forum for Naga Reconciliation has called a two-day convention of the Naga people from Myanmar, Nagaland, Assam, Manipur and Arunachal Pradesh, beginning tomorrow.        
	This convention, with Let my people go as the theme, will work towards brokering peace between the warring Naga factions.        
	The forum, supported by American Baptist church and Quakers from the UK, has already organised a few reconciliation meetings between the Naga militant groups, both in the state and abroad.         
	The two gatherings come at a time when the Naga peace process has reached a deadlock, with the people urging both the Centre and the NSCN (I-M) to be flexible in their stance.        
	The NSCN (I-M) had recently warned the Centre of resuming conflict in Nagalim (Nagaland) if the latter continued to be rigid in its approach.         
	The Naga outfit has already submitted its charter of proposals to the Centre. Among others, one of the demands is a special federal relation with Delhi.

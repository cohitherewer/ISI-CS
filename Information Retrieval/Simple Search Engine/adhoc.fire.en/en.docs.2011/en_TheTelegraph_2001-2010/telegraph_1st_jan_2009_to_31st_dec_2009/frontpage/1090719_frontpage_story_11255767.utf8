	Washington, July 18: The Obama administration is linking the implementation of the nuclear deal to an end-use monitoring agreement for military supplies from America in a determined effort to arm-twist India into signing the controversial defence pact on Monday.        
	Philip J. Crowley, an assistant secretary of state who was specially designated by the administration to brief foreign correspondents here yesterday shortly before Hillary Clinton landed in Mumbai, said the end-use monitoring agreement is part of the fulfilment of an important initiative that India and the US have signed in the area of nuclear co-operation.        
	Crowley added: I am sure that this will be (a) substantial area of discussion (between Clinton and the Indians) and the various leaders will reflect on the progress that is made in terms of both fulfilling the initiative and its various components.        
	Crowleys forthright assertion  that the defence agreement is a component of the nuclear deal  even as Indian and US officials are burning the midnight oil in New Delhi to ensure that there are no glitches in the American secretary of states highly choreographed trip to India is revealing on two counts.        
	One, this is the first time that any US official, either from the Bush era or an incumbent in the Obama team, has indicated that there was any understanding  such as buying American defence equipment  which facilitated the nuclear deal.         
	The US will not sell advanced military equipment unless India signs the end-use monitoring agreement that will allow Washington to inspect such equipment long after it has been bought.        
	Second, Crowleys hope that various (Indian) leaders will reflect on the progress that is made in terms of both fulfilling the (nuclear) initiative and its various components is tantamount to a threat that progress on the nuclear deal will only go hand in hand with progress on other unpublicised understandings such as defence purchases from the US.        
	Crowley also left the onus of showing progress on these counts on India. I will allow the officials in India to indicate that we have reached an agreement on end-use monitoring.        
	It is clear from the assistant secretarys statement that Clinton will expect New Delhi not to renege on what Washington sees as prior Indian commitments that allowed the passage of the nuclear deal here.        
	According to high-level sources in New Delhi, opinion has hardened among more sections of the political leadership against chipping away at the operational freedom of the defence forces by agreeing to future US inspections of military hardware bought by India.        
	As a result, top Indian officials who are continuing to discuss the end-use monitoring agreement with the Americans are now proposing that instead of signing the pact, Clinton and external affairs minister S.M. Krishna should merely announce that agreement has been reached on the issue between negotiators on both sides.        
	In the light of strong reservations among senior members of the cabinet on the agreement, the Prime Ministers Office is now understood to have taken the view that the agreement should be formally approved by the cabinet committee on security, although such a step is not mandatory.        
	Similar stand-alone agreements that enabled India to buy the US naval ship Trenton and Boeing planes for VVIP transport did not go to the committee, although those agreements are identical to the one that the US wants to be signed on Monday.        
	US officials here are insisting that they have bent over backwards to accommodate Indian concerns on end-use inspections.        
	They said that in a significant departure from the standard US text, the Obama administration had encouraged India to choose the venues for American inspections, even agreeing to checks in third countries.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Unfamiliar feeling of voting against CPM
                                                                                                           Unfamiliar feeling of voting against CPM
          IMRAN AHMED SIDDIQUI IN NANDIGRAM                              
	For three decades, land had bonded the likes of Subhasini Mali, Sudhir Pradhan and Arup Samanta to the CPM, a party that had taught them to hold our heads high.        
	Today, the issue of land prompted them all to vote against the party, for the first time in a Lok Sabha election in 32 years.        
	I voted for the Trinamul Congress not because I have developed a fondness for the party but because I have developed a hatred for the CPM, which once used to be pro-land, said Samanta, 55, a farmer from Sonachura.        
	Subhasini, 60, confessed to a strange feeling, having just cast her vote for Trinamul. She had not voted in the last rural polls, which Trinamul had swept in Nandigram.        
	Today is the first time in so many years that I have not voted for the CPM. But I have no regrets. Nobody should take loyalty for granted, she said standing before her hut in Sonachura.        
	Subhasini said that before the Left Front came to power in 1977, uncertainty ruled the lives of bargadars (sharecroppers), who were at the mercy of rich farmers and landlords.        
	All that changed with Operation Barga, launched in the initial years of Left Front rule. Sharecroppers right to work and their share of the produce became enshrined in law. Some, like Subhasinis family, rose to become land owners themselves.        
	We are land owners now, but in those days many in Nandigram were sharecroppers. The communist government taught us to hold our heads high, she said. But the same party and the same government have now become land grabbers. How can we forgive this, though they may have once come to the aid of many of us here?        
	Subhasini said she had been among the protesters who blocked the entry of police on March 14, 2007, which led to firing and the death of 14 people. I was lucky not to take a bullet hit, she said. But I fell down in the melee and broke my arm. That was the first time I was exposed to the brutality of this government.        
	Her story is repeated by many in Nandigram, an Assembly segment that had given the CPM a lead of nearly 6,000 votes in the 2004 Lok Sabha elections. The CPM had polled 68,122 votes then, compared with Trinamuls 62,439.        
	It will be a different story this time, said farmer Sudhir Pradhan, 65, a resident of Gangra village. This is because many people like me who have been die-hard CPM supporters today voted Trinamul.        
	Pradhan does not have anything against industrialisation but says a balance has to be struck between agriculture and industry.        
	The question that needs to be asked today is why people who have traditionally voted for the CPM have suddenly, and so vehemently, turned against the party, Pradhan said, his voice rising in anger. The CPM should have developed a consensus instead of bulldozing its way and turning land grabber.        
	The other word that has become a favourite to describe the ruling party in Nandigram is arrogant. Its this that turned Samanta, 55, from a staunch CPM supporter to a Trinamul voter.        
	The March 14 firing showed the cruelty and arrogance of the party and the government. I voted Trinamul because I want change, Samanta said.        
	Ashok Guria, the CPMs East Midnapore district secretary, admitted that many traditional party supporters had voted for the Opposition today.        
	Yes, its true, Guria said. But this is because of a misinformation campaign against the party. We are definitely not land-grabbers. Its because of our land reforms that many sharecroppers are land owners today.

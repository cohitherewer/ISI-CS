  - Mamata issues ultimatum after nexus barb from CM          OUR BUREAU                                  (From top) Bhattacharjee in Delhi, Mahato, Mamata in Calcutta. (Ramakant Kushwaha, file picture, Pradip Sanyal)                                       
	Calcutta, June 20: Ratan Tatas parting riddle for Bengal  the identities of the Good M and the Bad M  has never been conclusively settled. But if anyone were to ask whos the Pariah M in Bengal now, its a no-brainer: the Maoist.        
	Far from the forests of Lalgarh, Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee and Mamata Banerjee are now locked in a skirmish to decide who has supped with Maoists.        
	The chief minister himself told the Assembly that he studied Maoist literature. I think he is the biggest Maoist. Maoist literature could be found in his residence if a search is conducted. I want the Maoist chief minister to be sacked and arrested, Mamata said in Calcutta this evening.        
	Her immediate provocation was a claim by the chief minister in Delhi that her party has strong links with the public face of the rebellion in Lalgarh.        
	Mamata has served a 48-hour ultimatum on the chief minister to withdraw a statement that her party was in cahoots with those spearheading the rebellion in Lalgarh. I want the chief minister to withdraw his statement within the next 48 hours and if it is not done, I shall hit the streets demanding the dismissal of the government, she said.        
	Bhattacharjee did not specifically mention the word Maoist while alleging the nexus but referred to the Peoples Committee Against Police Atrocities, which had been spearheading the protest. The Trinamul Congress has strong links with the so-called Peoples Committee Against Police Atrocities active in Lalgarh. The leader of the group, Chhatradhar Mahato, is very much a member of the Trinamul Congress, the chief minister said.        
	Although the committee has been denying any contact with the Maoists, the state government believes that the Lalgarh rebellion could not have been sustained for so long without help from the guerrilla group.        
	Mamata, caught between the compulsion to stand by the tribals of Lalgarh and the ne-ed to steer clear of the Maoists who claimed they had quot;fou-ght quot; alongside her party in Nandigram, said Mahato used to be a member of Trinamul but was thrown out two years ago because of his Maoist links.         
	 quot;Chhatradhar Mahato was our party member but we expelled him two years ago after coming to know of his Maoist connections. We have no links with the Maoists in Lalgarh, quot; Mamata said.         
	In the rush to disown the Maoists - by all parties - lies an irony. The CPI (Maoist), outlawed in many states, is not an illegal outfit in Bengal yet.         
	On his part, Mahato claimed he quot;left Trinamul on my own, I was not expelled quot;.        
	Officially just a member of the committee, Mahato is considered the de facto leader. Many trace his disproportionate clout to his brother who is a Maoist. quot;The Maoists are controlling the movement th-rough Mahato, quot; said a villager.        
	But Mahato said: quot;The government will be unable to prove any charge. We have done nothing wrong. quot;        
	Born in 1964 in Amlia village in Lalgarh, Mahato co-m-es from a comparatively well-off family. After clearing the higher secondary examination from Kantapahari Hi-gh School, he went to Midnapore College but dropped out soon.        
	Mahato had started a business to supply plates made of sal leaves, which till date he claims to be his profession. Five years ago, he joined Trinamul. However, his brother Sashadhar had become a Ma-oist at the age of 16. quot;Naxalites used to come to our village, enacting street plays. My brother went away with them as a teenager, quot; said Mahato.         
	Two years ago, he and his younger brother Anil were arrested when police came looking for Sashadhar, now wanted in a number of cases, including the blast targeting the chief ministers convoy that led to the current crisis.

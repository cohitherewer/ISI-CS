   Enter Salman, wait for SRK
          OUR BUREAU                            Salman Khan with Congress candidate Anu Tandon in Unnao. Picture by Naeem Ansari                                        
	March 29: Salman Khan today made a surprise appearance as Congress campaigner in Uttar Pradesh, gyrating to film numbers such as Ishq di gali vich no entry.        
	To many, reading siyasat (politics) for ishq (love), it seemed as though Salman was sending a message to rival Shah Rukh Khan.        
	Shah Rukh and Preity Zinta, not Salman, had been expected to campaign for the Congress, but the political grapevine today buzzed with the question if Indias Grand Old Party was big enough any more to have room for two fighting Bollywood Khans.        
	Speculation is rife about an element of chill in SRKs relations with the Congress following an alleged break-up with a party MP who had introduced him to Delhis power circles.        
	If this is true, King Khan would be joining several other stars in realising that the gali (lane) from Bollywood to politics can sometimes offer a bumpy ride.        
	One of them is the Congresss Mumbai North MP, Govinda, out in the cold after five years of truancy from Parliament and constituency.        
	Another is Sanjay Dutt, the Samajwadi Partys man for the Lucknow seat, whose convoy was stoned by star-struck students who shouted Sanju Baba, bahar aao (step out). His party later said the hecklers belonged to a rival party.        
	But Salman, who shares a good rapport with Govinda and Sanjay in Bollywoods internal politics, enjoyed a smoother ride in the heartland today.        
	Salman appeared at a series of Holi Milan programmes  a euphemism for poll rallies  for the Congress candidate from crime-ridden Unnao, where daily life can rival any Bollywood thriller in blood and gore. Anu Tandon is up against the Bahujan Samaj Partys Arun Shankar Shukla, an alleged mafia don, in this dustbowl 50km from Lucknow.        
	Salman went stage-hopping from village to village. At 11am, he was at Bighapur, at 12 at Hasanganj, then at Bagharmou.        
	He stepped on the stage at Purwa escorted by four muscular securitymen. He shook hands with Tandon and broke into a jig as loudspeakers blared a film number. Tandon said the actor would campaign for her and a few other candidates over the next few days.        
	Party sources insisted that Shah Rukh and Preity were scheduled to campaign in April. Even if they do, the appearances are likely to be token affairs as the Indian Premier League is expected to keep them busy abroad.                  Shah Rukh Khan      
	Shah Rukh Khan is expected to campaign in Uttar Pradesh and Delhi but has not confirmed dates. Preity is expected in UP and Punjab but her dates have also not been finalised, state Congress spokesperson Akhilesh Pratap Singh said.        
	Other sources, however, said that though SRK continued to have a good personal rapport with Priyanka Vadra, he might be disinclined to campaign for the Congress.        
	The Khans have not been on talking terms since a spat at the birthday party of Salmans actress girlfriend, Katrina Kaif, a few months ago.        
	Salmans father Salim, the celebrated scriptwriter, is a Congress sympathiser, and at a news conference in Lucknow, the actor today confessed to political ambitions.        
	I can join politics but only if Rahul Gandhi invites me, Salman said. Congress sources said an MP from Mumbai had played a role in bringing Salman closer to Rahul. In the past few weeks, each time Salman visited Delhi, he is said to have met Rahul.        
	But Salmans friend Govinda may advise him to think twice before taking the political plunge.        
	Govinda grouse                  Govinda      
	Govinda would not have been amused today to hear Maharashtras Congress chief minister say the actor did not want to be a candidate this time.        
	Govinda, like other sitting MPs, was asked if he was willing to contest but declined the offer, Ashok Chavan told reporters.        
	But sources close to the actor said he wanted to contest very much  but not from his Mumbai North constituency. He wanted Mumbai Northwest.         
	Vasai and Palghar, where Govindaji scored leads in the last election, have (gone) to Mumbai Northwest after delimitation, so he wanted that seat, Govindas brother and spokesperson Kirti Ahuja said.        
	But the party did not want that (and) he decided to pull out. He is keen to focus on his films now.        
	The state Congress had forwarded Govindas name for Mumbai North in keeping with the party norm on sitting MPs. But the actor, unpopular among state leaders and workers, tried to bypass them and approached the high command for Mumbai Northwest, a source said.        
	The move backfired and Govinda lost the bird in hand too. His performance in the last five years was very poor. He failed to connect or deliver the goods in the constituency. He was hardly seen there, Congress spokesperson Sanjay Nirupam said.        
	Govinda attended just 12 per cent of the Lok Sabhas sessions  the lowest among all MPs.        
	Chavan told agencies that actress Nagma was willing to contest from Mumbai North. She is one of the applicants.        
	Sources said Nagma, originally short-listed for Mumbai Northwest, was not on top of the list for Mumbai North yet. Nirupam is a possible candidate, too.  
	Poll stars            
	Sanjay Dutt  
	Tastes the rough and tumble of politics, with stones flying at his convoy in Lucknow. The Supreme Court is scheduled to take up on Monday the question whether the convicted 
  actor can contest            
	Shekhar Suman  
	The Congress is said to be wooing TV star Shekhar Suman to field him against the BJP rsquo;s Shatrughan Sinha in the Patna Saheb seat. Shekhar is a Kayastha mdash; the same caste as Shatru that prompted a reluctant BJP to offer the veteran actor the seat. After delimitation, Patna Saheb has a considerable number 
  of Kayasthas  
	With inputs from Tapas Chakraborty, Rasheed Kidwai and Samyabrata Ray Goswami

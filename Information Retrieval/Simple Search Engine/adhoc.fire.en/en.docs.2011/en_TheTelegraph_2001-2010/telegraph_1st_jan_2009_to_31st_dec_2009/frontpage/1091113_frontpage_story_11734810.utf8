	Ranchi, Nov. 12: On a joint drive with the Enforcement Directorate to unearth embezzled crores, the income tax department has so far recovered only Rs 23.65 lakh and $ 3,430 (Rs 1.6 lakh) from former chief minister Madhu Koda and his two key associates, Vinod Sinha and Sanjay Choudhary.        
	Tax officer Ranjit Kumar Lal today filed an affidavit before a division bench of Jharkhand High Court saying raids were conducted on 69 premises owned by Koda and his aides. He said that the department was in touch with various banks to find out about fixed deposits made in the former chief ministers name.         
	Sleuths raided Kodas home on October 31 and are still interrogating him there. Sinha and Choudhary have been evading interrogation despite repeated summons.         
	Jharkhand police today sounded an alert to all states and district police chiefs to arrest Sinha and Choudhary, coaccused with Koda in an assets case. Additional director-general of police (CID) G.S. Rath said the alert had been sounded following the tax departments arrest warrants against the duo yesterday.        
	ED summon        
	The Enforcement Directorate (ED) has issued fresh summons to Mumbai-based bullion traders and hawala agents Manoj Punamia, Arvind Vyas and Lalit Jain  believed to be close associates of Madhu Koda and company  to appear before it on November 16.        
	Koda is expected to go to Delhi a day before. Interrogation by tax officials, however, continued at Kodas residence even today.        
	After Mumbai, Delhi will be the centre stage of interrogation by ED and tax sleuths. Tax director (investigation) Ujjwal Chaudhary and ED deputy director Prabha Kant today returned to Delhi. Two tax officials from Ranchi have also left for Delhi.        
	Sources revealed that they had zeroed in on Punamia as the main hawala and bullion agent managing the foreign illegal transactions made by Koda and his associates.        
	The officials are also assessing whether bullion trades were actually made or the seized invoices were counterfeit. Vikas Sinha, brother of Vinod Sinha, is in ED custody. He is a partner of Balaji Bullion amp; Commodities. The ED authorities are said to be cross-checking facts with Vikas.        
	Both ED and tax sleuths have found that maximum amounts illegally amassed by Koda and his henchmen are from allotment of mines to prospective investors, transfer and posting of technocrats and bureaucrats and from a Rs 1,480-crore rural electrification project.         
	The ED has approached Switzerland for information on investment and transactions made by the former chief minister and his associates. Earlier, authorities in Indonesia, the UAE, Liberia, Thailand Singapore were also approached.

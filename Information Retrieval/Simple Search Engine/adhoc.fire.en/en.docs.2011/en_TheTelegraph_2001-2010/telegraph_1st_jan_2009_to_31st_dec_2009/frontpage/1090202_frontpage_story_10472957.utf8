	New Delhi, Feb. 1: An apparent instance of drink-fuelled air rage activated a hijack alert in Delhi this afternoon, forcing an IndiGo flight to make an emergency landing and touching off a three-hour drill that held up passengers and several flights.        
	All 163 passengers and six crew members aboard Flight 6E 334 from Goa were safe, officials said tonight.        
	Sources said three passengers, one of them allegedly drunk, wanted to switch seats and picked a fight with the crew. During the altercation, one of the three  two men and a woman  apparently said he was carrying a knife and threatened to hijack the plane, the sources added. Other sources claimed the enraged passenger said the plane would be blown up        
	One passenger said one person flew into a rage when he was not allowed to sleep on a three-seat row in the rear. Everybody was confused, another passenger, Ramnik Singh, said.        
	The pilot sent a request to Delhi airport for emergency landing. The plane, on way to Delhi in any case and 15 minutes away from its destination, was then hovering over Jaipur.        
	The plane was taken by the pilot to an isolated bay at Indira Gandhi International Airport at 5.29pm, where National Security Guard commandos surrounded it.        
	The passengers were made to sit inside till around 8.30 before an all-clear was given.        
	Aircraft operations were suspended for an hour and several planes that had landed delayed the disembarking process. Some incoming flights were asked to hover over the Delhi airspace for some time.        
	The committee of secretaries on anti-hijacking, chaired by cabinet secretary K.M. Chandrashekar, also met. The steps were in line with the procedures drawn up after the 1999 hijack of a plane to Kandahar.        
	Hijack warnings had been issued to several airports last week following an intelligence tip-off.        
	Home minister P. Chidambaram tonight said the three passengers had been detained. He said that at one stage, it appeared to be a potential hijack situation.        
	Three persons have been detained. We have names but unless they are interrogated and (their) identity established, we cant release the names, he said. All actions were taken according to the book and I am relieved and happy that the situation has been resolved and all the passengers are safe.        
	Chidambaram said the pilot of the Airbus A320 had correctly assessed the situation as a potential hijack threat.        
	The minister said he could not rule out anything. By tomorrow, we will be able to tell you more about whether it was indeed a hijack or anything else and what was the role of the persons detained.        
	The minister said no arms were found on the detained persons.

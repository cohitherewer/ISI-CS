The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Bar on new shrines of all religions on roads
                                                                                                           Bar on new shrines of all religions on roads
          OUR BUREAU AND PTI                              
	Sept. 29: The Supreme Court has barred for the time being fresh construction of places of worship of all religions on public roads and left it to states to decide on the removal of existing shrines that affect traffic.        
	In one of the most secular orders in recent memory that treats all religions on an even keel, the court said the order would apply to all places of worship like temples, mosques, churches and gurdwaras.        
	The court said the interim directive would be in force till the case relating to construction of places of worship at public places was resolved.        
	Looking to the gravity and far-reaching consequences of the issues, we have decided to implead all states and Union territories in the matter, a bench of Justices Dalveer Bhandari and Mukundakam Sharma said. The apex court has sought the response of the states and Union territories.        
	The bench, however, said it was for the states and Union territories to decide on a case-to-case basis the removal or otherwise of existing places of worship which have encroached on public roads/lanes throughout the country.        
	Encroachment of public places by religious structures is cited as one of the causes of traffic snarls in several cities in the country. Calcutta High Court had recently ratified guidelines set for Puja pandals that required them to leave vacant prescribed space on all sides, though the rules were not enforced by the state government this year.        
	Some shrines also stand in the way of plans to build infrastructure, such as a project to expand a Calcutta airport runway. It is not clear if the ruling will have any bearing on such places of worship.        
	Todays Supreme Court directive has also addressed a perception among a section of the people that some religions are treated more leniently when such issues are taken up by governments and the judiciary.        
	The apex court issued the directive after solicitor-general Gopal Subramanium made a plea for such an order as all states and Union territories had in principle agreed on September 17 that they would not permit fresh construction of places of worship.        
	In order to ensure compliance with its order, the apex court said district collectors would act as nodal officers and send their reports to the chief secretary of the state concerned.        
	The chief secretaries in turn would file their reports to the apex court within eight weeks.        
	In Calcutta, chief secretary Asok Mohan Chakrabarti said tonight that the state government would comply with the Supreme Court order. The apex courts order has to be complied with. But I have not yet received a copy of the order. Let me first have a copy of the order and then we shall decide on removal of existing shrines, he said.        
	The apex court issued the interim directive while hearing a petition challenging a Gujarat High Court order of May 2006. The Gujarat court had asked municipal corporations in the state to demolish all illegal structures, including places of worship, on public roads.        
	The high court order was later stayed by the apex court on the Centres appeal that had referred to likely consequences related to law and order.         
	The Centre, which was not a party before the high court, had filed the petition after communal violence had broken out in Vadodara and the army had to stage a flag march.

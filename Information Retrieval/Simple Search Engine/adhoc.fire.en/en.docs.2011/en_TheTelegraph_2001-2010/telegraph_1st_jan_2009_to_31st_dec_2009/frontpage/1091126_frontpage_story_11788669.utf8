                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                WOUNDED WALKWAY
          PING, PING, PING SHRIEKS THE METAL DETECTOR BUT FEW LISTEN. SANKARSHAN THAKUR RETRACES THE STEPS OF KASAB AT CST                            A sign saying Mumbai, a vantage point from where tourists usually take pictures of the Gateway of India. (AFP picture)                                  
	Mumbai, Nov 25: Call it hall of fame, call it hall of infamy, but Ajmal Amir Kasab has shot his way into it and found a place for himself.         
	Kasab Bridge, thats how south Mumbai folk have begun to refer to the overhead exit from the north gate of Chhatrapati Shivaji Terminus (CST), if only as a reminder of what they dont want repeated, as a memorial to the monumental lapses of the night of 26/11.        
	That night, Kasab and Ismail Khan left 56 dead in a 15-minute firing spree on the CST concourse, and walked out the footbridge, blithe and quite unchallenged, on their way to putting many more to death, three top Mumbai policemen included.        
	They could have re-run their raid this afternoon, and probably exacted a higher toll because at two, CST was a honeycomb of humanity, unguarded save for closed-circuit television, which is at best an instrument of hindsight. And who has any use for hindsight anyhow? Do a walkabout at the CST, and youll know. Littles changed.                  Kasab Bridge        
	You walk into CSTs busy belly from the back, as Kasab and Ismail probably did, and you have a choice of going straight in or passing through a metal detector that proclaims in bold print that it is to be manned by the RPF  Railway Protection Force. But thats where the manning begins and ends, on a piece of paper cello-taped to the detectors crossbar. Its pinging incessantly to the human torrent passing through, but nobodys bothered  long pings, small pings, staccato pings, ping, ping, ping, ping, ping. It doesnt ring a bell, much less alarm.        
	So Kasab and Ismail have arrived, lets take it, in this target-rich theatre sans checks, sans trouble. Whats to stop them now? Whats to stop anyone with an automatic weapon?        
	Just imagine it a moment: a mid-afternoon terror raid at CST, a bloody bedlam of the dead and the injured, panic, pandemonium. The fancied Force One of the Maharashtra police is in barracks 20km away in Goregaon.        
	NSG ranks from the newly created hub are quite as far away, drilling about in makeshift quarters in north Mumbais Kalina. First response, the NSG has promised, will come within 30 minutes. It will take more coming in from Kalina to CST, and should they meet their markers, it will still be too late.        
	Resistance at the CST, meantime, is made up of no more than a handful of policemen nearing superannuation with weapons well past being effective  single-loading 303s, no match for the automatic bursts issuing from the raiders.        
	Imagine whats to stop them? Imagine whats to stop them escaping this anarchy? No more than another set of those derelict investments prompted by terror, metal detectors that can do no more than harmlessly ping for truant ears.        
	At an easy canter, the footbridge out  Kasab Bridge takes barely a minute to cross, and quite suddenly youve dropped into the cavernous safety of Badruddin Tyabji Lane, a bereft alley that will deliver you bang behind the Cama Hospital, or should you so choose, the rear gates of the headquarters of the Mumbai police.        
	Its been seven minutes now since you exited CST, too much time to make yourself scarce in the warrens behind the magnificent facades of south Mumbai. Theres no guard posted en route, no signs of surveillance, nothing that would prevent you melting away into anonymous protections from the chaos you just left behind.        
	Kasab and company were too audacious of intent, they hopped from mayhem to mayhem like it was their last night of party and they had to have a blast. They could well have ducked into the darkness of Badruddin Tyabji Lane and vanished.        
	Rewind your path to the south gate of CST, where the station disgorges its arrivals and gathers its departees  the main fairway in and out of this workhorse terminus  and the ironies of the fancy first anniversary memorials being mounted across Mumbai turn terse.        
	Strung along the walls is a pictorial montage of the three days that garlanded the prided end of this showpiece metropolis in spectacular horror. These are images with a NEVER AGAIN superscript tagged atop, each a testimonial to what should not have happened.        
	But cast a glance across the fairway at the unmanned turnstiles of the CST and youre bound to think it could well happen again.        
	Hoga to hoga (if it happens again, it will happen again), says a commuter nonchalantly as he leaves the photo gallery, sarkar ka kaam sarkar dekhe, apun ko to life chalaneka jaise taise (thats the governments concern, I have to somehow just run my life).        
	The Mumbaikar has not been short on promises made and hell be handed fulsome bouquets of vows renewed tomorrow as Mumbai stages its commemorations, chief among which will be an open-air all-faith affair on the Gateway of India deck.        
	Among the VVIPs attending will be the living irony of home minister R.R. Patil, who a year ago lost the same job owing to the failures that brought on 26/11. The Mumbaikar would feel safer attending the private prayer meetings at the Taj across the street. But thatll be a strictly private affair, the rights of admission even more strictly reserved by the hosts.        
	Entering the new Taj is a far cry from the loose arrangements at the CST  state-of-the-art scanners, private security men tuned to the sounds of every ping their detectors make, polite but steely ushers armed with the authority to turn you away should you not suit their gaze.        
	The Taj lobby makes for an assured sense of safety, air-conditioned to boot. But then theres an extraordinary price to pay for the high value the Taj puts on life; the ordinary who must daily mill in and out of the CST carry mean tags to them, and they go cheap.

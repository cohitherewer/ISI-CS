          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                            Sonia in Delhi on Wednesday. (PTI)                                  
	New Delhi, Sept. 30: The Congress has turned down a request by President Pratibha Patils son that Sonia Gandhi campaign for him in Amravati, the Maharashtra seat for which the family lobbied hard.        
	Having reluctantly accommodated Rajendra Shekhawat as the partys candidate in the seat and triggering rebellion by a minister, the Congress now appears keen to shield the leadership from a possible backlash if the first son loses or the contest creates more dissidence.        
	Congress leaders in Delhi said requests for rallies by Sonia and Rahul Gandhi had come from every candidate but it was not possible to oblige all. But Shekhawats case is different  a defeat will acutely embarrass both the President and the party.         
	Shekhawat is facing stiff opposition from the rebel Sunil Deshmukh, who enjoys the support of a vast section of the local unit. Shekhawat is dependent largely on his Rashtrapati Bhavan links and Sonias campaign would have come as a boon.        
	Party leaders said a visit by Sonia could also have quelled the anger of Congress workers to a great extent.        
	But even senior Maharashtra leaders are cynical about Shekhawats prospects, forcing Sonia to stay away from the constituency. So far, the seat does not fall on her itinerary.        
	Deshmukhs supporters, who have moved the Election Commission against the use of Patils photographs in the constituency, are already talking of his return to the party after his impending victory.        
	Sources revealed that the central leadership tried its best till yesterday, the last day of withdrawing nomination, to compel Deshmukh to pull out of the race.        
	While an AICC secretary, Avinash Pandey, was sent on a special chopper to Amravati with a compromise formula, general secretaries Digvijay Singh and Janardan Dwivedi spoke to him over the phone. Deshmukh was assured adequate rehabilitation but he refused to withdraw.        
	Sonia is scheduled to address six rallies in Maharashtra during her visits to the state on October 5, 6 and 10. The likely venues are Buldhana, Nanded, Kolha- pur, Mumbai, Nashik and Nagpur.         
	Rahul is expected to spend two days in the state on October 7 and 8 and will address eight rallies. He, too, will skip Amravati. Prime Minister Manmohan Singh will make only one visit to Mumbai.        
	The Congress, which faces strong rebels in many constituencies in the state, is however delighted by the fresh bout between the Thackerays.

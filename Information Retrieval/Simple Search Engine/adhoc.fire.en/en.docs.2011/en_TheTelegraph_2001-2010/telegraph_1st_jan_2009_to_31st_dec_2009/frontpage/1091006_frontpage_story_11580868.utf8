          SANJAY K. JHA                            Rahul Gandhi                                  
	New Delhi, Oct. 5: Rahul Gandhi, who has been trying to energise the party machinery, may do well to start at the All India Congress Committee headquarters.        
	Most AICC departments and cells, whose job is to strengthen the organisation and mobilise support for the party, are lying defunct.        
	These cells have by and large become additional rooms for accommodating favoured individuals in the partys higher rungs. Few of their office-bearers take their jobs seriously because their aim is to enter the main secretariat as general secretary or secretary.        
	These departments are all white elephants doing nothing at all, an official from one of the cells told The Telegraph.        
	Some of the department heads make appointments at district and block levels and remain happy. Others are happy seeing their nameplates in the AICC office. Some secretaries use the offices here to meet their friends.        
	The AICC now has 16 such departments relating to foreign affairs, minority affairs, media, Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes, Other Backward Classes, research and reference, grievances, policy planning and co-ordination, training, panchayati raj, farmers and labour, and ex-servicemen apart from the computer, legal and intellectual cells.        
	Except the media department, which has to co-ordinate with the media and hold regular briefings, most of these departments have little to show in terms of achievements.        
	Their offices at the party headquarters, 24 Akbar Road, remain locked and the officials rarely make an appearance. While some department heads are tied elsewhere because of multiple responsibilities, a few have abandoned their offices after becoming Union ministers.        
	Two ambitious departments launched by Sonia Gandhi  those relating to policy planning and co-ordination, and to research and reference  were headed by M. Veerappa Moily and Jairam Ramesh. Both are now ministers.        
	Janardan Dwivedi, who heads the training department, another important project in Sonias scheme of things, is also in charge of the media department and party organisation.         
	The foreign affairs department is headed by Karan Singh, who never visits his office. He occasionally makes his presence felt when foreign dignitaries call on Sonia.        
	ST department chief Ajit Jogi has left Delhi to settle down in Raipur and the SC department chief, Yogendra Makwana, has quit the Congress. The OBC department chairman, K.C. Lenka, too, rarely comes to the party office. Kisan and Khet Mazdoor Congress chief Shamsher Singh Surjewala is permanently based in Haryana.        
	These cells are expected to periodically organise programmes and mobilise support for the party among tribals, Dalits, OBCs, farmers and farm workers, but they rarely work.        
	The computer department is headed by Vishvjit Prithvi Singh. Its performance is reflected in the gulf between the BJPs thriving, regularly updated website and the Congresss dysfunctional one.        
	The minority affairs department is more active than most other cells but has not been able to deliver anything significant despite its huge potential. It has created a network of minority cells in the state units but done little to mobilise support in states where Muslims have drifted towards regional parties.

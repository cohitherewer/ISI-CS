  - A moment to pause before a milestone          RADHIKA RAMASESHAN                            Priyanka Gandhi being greeted by Manmohan Singh at Veer Bhoomi on the late Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhis death anniversary. Picture by Rajesh Kumar                                              
	New Delhi, May 21: The DMK this evening threatened to sit outside the government, unable to turn around Manmohan Singh who insisted his council of ministers should have a clean reputation and prompting Sonia Gandhi to call on the Prime Minister late tonight.        
	Singh, who is said to have reservations about at least two DMK nominees who were ministers in his erstwhile council, reportedly put his foot down and refused to accommodate them.        
	The dramatic turn of events came less than 24 hours before Singh was to be sworn in Prime Minister for a second term.         
	Sonia was in the Prime Ministers house well past midnight. If a solution is not found before 6.30pm  the swearing-in has been pushed back by an hour for procedural reasons  Singh is likely to keep the disputed ministries with him for the time being, sources said.        
	The DMKs vocal display of discontent, suitably aired before television cameras, came in the evening. My leader Karunanidhi has advised me to inform that the DMK will support the government from outside, said T.R. Baalu, one of the nominees reportedly disfavoured by Singh.        
	The purported reason for the DMKs disenchantment is the Congresss failure to set aside the berths  both in quantity and quality  sought by the southern ally which, with 18 MPs, is the second largest partner after the Trinamul Congress.        
	However, sources said the biggest sticking point was the inclusion of the names of Baalu and A. Raja  both ministers in the first UPA government  in a list Karunanidhi sent across to Pranab Mukherjee. The list, handed over by Baalu himself to the Congresss chief interlocutor, was the political equivalent of a red rag as the bigger party had conveyed to the DMK the Prime Ministers misgivings about certain nominees.        
	No specific charges were raised against any individual. But a whiff of controversy had hung around some ministries handled by Baalu and Raja last time. Baalu had looked after shipping, road transport and highways, while communications and information technology were run by Raja. Some of these ministries handle contracts that deal with crores of rupees.        
	His hands no longer tied by mercurial allies  the UPA now has the pledged support of 304 MPs even without the DMK which in any case has offered backing from outside  the Prime Minister is learnt to have told his party that he might be willing to let political nominees fill economic portfolios but he should be allowed to pick a clean team.        
	During the day, Singh phoned Karunanidhi, camping at the capitals Tamil Nadu Bhavan with his family, who said the Congresss stand was unacceptable. As part of the brinkmanship, the DMK claimed that Karunanidhi had blocked seats in three airlines to leave Delhi tomorrow morning if the talks collapse.        
	Officially, the DMK found fault with the Congress formula of one berth for every seven MPs, saying such an arrangement was not in existence in 2004 when the southern ally had two MPs less but three cabinet berths and five ministers of state. The DMK now wants nine berths, but the Congress is not willing to offer more than five or, at the most, six.        
	But the intractable issues are the two ministers and Karunanidhis demand that three relatives be accommodated. Allies such as Mamata Banerjee are also wary of giving too many berths to the DMK and opening the government to the risk of corruption charges.        
	Some allies like the NCP, however, are said to be pushing the line that allies should be allowed to retain the portfolios they held.        
	The NCP was sulking after word was out that the Congress wanted to bifurcate the agriculture and food supplies ministry held by Sharad Pawar. The Congress saw a conflict of interest in coupling the two departments because the pricing mechanism for agricultural produce had allegedly been devised to help the NCPs core constituency of the kulaks of west Maharashtra.        
	The National Conference is also unhappy  Farooq Abdullah is apparently going ahead with plans to proceed to South Africa tomorrow to watch the IPL.

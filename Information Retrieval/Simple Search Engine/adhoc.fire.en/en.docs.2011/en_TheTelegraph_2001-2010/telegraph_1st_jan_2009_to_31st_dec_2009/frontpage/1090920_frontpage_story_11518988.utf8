          OUR CORRESPONDENT                               
	Imphal, Sept. 19: Militants fired three lethod bombs at the private residence of Manipur food and civil supplies minister Yumkham Erabot Singh late last night.         
	However, no one was injured in the attack.         
	The minister said the militants attacked the southern portion of his house at Khurai Ahongei in Imphal East at 11.20pm.         
	They fired three lethod bombs. One hit a pillar of the unfinished upper portion of the house and exploded. The other two bombs landed in a pond beyond my house and failed to explode, the minister said today.         
	This is the fifth time militants have targeted my house. They fired shots and sometimes hurled hand grenades, he added.        
	Though no one was injured in the attacks, his family members were traumatised, he said. I do not know which group is behind the attack. I do not know what do they want from me, he added.         
	The attackers defied the presence of 10 Manipur Rifle guards at the ministers residence. Earlier this month, the minister forced open a locked rice godown at Sangaiprou in Imphal West and let the transporters lift rice for distribution to other districts.

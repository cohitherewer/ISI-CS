The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | India flexible, US dangles dollars   75% deal on norms to verify emission cuts
                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                India flexible, US dangles dollars     75% deal on norms to verify emission cuts
          JAYANTA BASU                                                    
	Copenhagen, Dec. 17: India has shown a sign of accommodation at the climate change summit here, indicating it is ready to discuss international scrutiny of its domestic actions to curb greenhouse emissions.         
	Delhis negotiating manoeuvre may have helped secure a gift from America to developing countries  an announcement this morning by secretary of state Hillary Clinton that the US would work with other nations to create by 2020 a $100-billion-a-year fund to help the developing countries deal with climate change.         
	India has consistently asserted that it would open only emission-curbing actions supported by foreign finance to international scrutiny  a process known as monitoring review and verification (MRV). Both India and China have been under pressure from the European Union and the US to allow MRV on all emission-curbing actions.         
	Environment minister Jairam Ramesh, who had indicated the need for the country to be flexible, today said India had agreed to three-fourths of the issues involving verification. We had a meeting with the Americans this morning and had 75 per cent agreement on verification  25 per cent remain, Ramesh said.        
	The modus operandi of reporting of domestic actions to international agencies such as a UN climate change agency remains a sore point, a source said. While India is prepared to give some information, Americans want more.         
	We dont want MRV to become a make-or-break issue  there are other important issues like Kyoto (Protocol) and the long-term co-operation that need to be sorted out, the minister said. I said in Parliament we need to be flexible. Anyway, India is one of the most transparent countries in the world and we have nothing to hide.        
	CPM leader Sitaram Yechury, who is part of the Indian delegation at the climate summit, said if India agreed to the provisions of MRV for domestic action, the issue would be raised in Parliament.        
	Rameshs announcement came after Clinton made a veiled threat in Copenhagen that unless China and India took on emission curbs and opened themselves to international monitoring of their emission curbs, no US financial deal would be possible.        
	Clinton said the US would help raise funds as long as China and India accepted binding commitments that they were open to international inspection and verification.         
	In the absence of an operational agreement that meets the requirements that I outlined, there will not be that financial agreement, at least from the US, Clinton said, reflecting the Obama administrations domestic compulsions. Unless the Obama administration can convince politicians back home that China and India have made some concessions, emission controls in the US would be impossible to push through.        
	Clinton said the US expected transparency in actions aimed at curbing emissions.        
	Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, who reached Copenhagen today, said in a statement before leaving Delhi: We are willing to do more (to reduce emissions) provided there are credible arrangements to provide additional financial support (and) technological transfers from the developed to the developing countries.         
	Ramesh said two draft texts released by two groups of negotiators at the climate summit would form the core of the political draft that is expected to emerge from the summit. A key contentious issue in the talks has been whether to continue with the 12-year old Kyoto Protocol which imposes legally binding emissions reductions on the rich countries.        
	Developing countries want industrialised countries to take on deep emissions reductions in the second phase of the Kyoto Protocol -- 2013 onwards.        
	But several industrialised countries are unhappy that the US and China which make up 50 per cent of the worlds emissions are not part of the Kyoto Protocol. They want a new pact with both US and China onboard.         
	Clinton, while announcing the $100 billion pledge, said the US expected transparency in actions aimed at curbing emissions.         
	If there is not even a commitment to pursue transparency, thats kind of a dealbreaker for us, Clinton said. All the major economies have committed to transparency. Now that were trying to define what transparency means and how we would both implement it and observe it, there is a backing away from transparency, she said.        
	Non-government conference observers have welcomed the US pledge, but said the source of the funding and the contribution from the US itself still remains unclear.         
	Financing was one of the missing pieces in Copenhagen, said Jennifer Morgan, a senior analyst with the World Resources Institute in the US. This is a solid first step. But the world will need further clarification on the specifics, particularly whether this money will be additional to current funding, Morgan said.

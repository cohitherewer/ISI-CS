The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Land Heralds paper rebirth
                                                                                                           Land Heralds paper rebirth
          RASHEED KIDWAI                            The National Herald office in Indore                                  
	Sept. 10: When land is precious, what is the best way to preserve it? Revive a newspaper, better still if it has a nationalistic past.        
	National Herald, Jawaharlal Nehrus dream project founded in 1938 and the Congresss voice for many years, has resumed publication from Indore, but nobody in the party seems to be aware of it.        
	The newspaper, which had suffered massive losses for years, had shut down in March 2008 when the employees union and Congress treasurer Motilal Vora signed an agreement to declare its death. The employees of the Delhi-based newspaper were paid a total compensation of over Rs 40 crore.        
	But suddenly this month, the paper has resurfaced from Indore, where it never had an edition but owned a sprawling plot of prime land on lease, with its trademark masthead saying Founded by Jawaharlal Nehru.         
	Behind the revival is Vishnu Goyal, a one-time stockbroker and chit fund operator who has assumed the role of chief editor.        
	Speaking to The Telegraph, Vora, a former Madhya Pradesh chief minister, sounded a tad perplexed. I have to examine the records of the ownership of the Indore land, he said.         
	Asked if he had assigned any franchisee or authorised its publication, the Congress treasurer said: You are well aware that we announced suspension of the publication last year.        
	Documents with the office of Indore additional district magistrate Narayan Patidar, who is empowered to sanction publications from the city, include a letter from The Associated Journals Ltd, New Delhi, National Heralds parent company, authorising the newspapers publication and use of the National Herald title.         
	What is intriguing is that the letter is dated June 5, 2008, two months after Vora asked all National Herald employees to opt for a compulsory retirement scheme.         
	Saud Akhtar, former president of the National Herald Employees Union, said he would not like to believe such details. It is baffling how the management could even think of starting the paper when it was giving a burial to the existing one, he said.        
	Akhtar said the union had no idea the paper had resumed publication. This was never discussed or told to us. Is Soniaji aware of it? he asked. We were always told that whenever the paper is revived, it will be in Delhi and that we will be taken into confidence.        
	Sunil Salve, the editor of the paper, said they were utilising the land allotted to the organisation. Land had been allotted to the paper and so we have revived it. A copy of the paper was given to Voraji and to Madhya Pradesh governor Rameshwar Thakur.        
	Thakur had served as chairman of the publication during the early 1990s. He, however, refused to say anything on the Heralds revival. I do not wish to comment as I am no longer part of it. As governor, I meet many persons and receive books, magazines, papers, etc., he said.        
	The paper is being published from a tract at Indores Press Complex, surrounded by several newspaper offices. Local authorities said the 22,000sqft plot in the prime Palasia area was obtained by Associated Journals at a concessional rate from the Indore Development Authority in the early nineties when P.V. Narasimha Rao was Prime Minister.        
	At present, the makeshift office occupies barely 5 per cent of the total plot. According to city property agents, the commercial value of the land will be between Rs 3 crore and Rs 5 crore if one goes by a conservative estimate.        
	Patidar, the additional district magistrate, said the land was under some kind of dispute. We will look into the matter if any complaint is filed, he said.

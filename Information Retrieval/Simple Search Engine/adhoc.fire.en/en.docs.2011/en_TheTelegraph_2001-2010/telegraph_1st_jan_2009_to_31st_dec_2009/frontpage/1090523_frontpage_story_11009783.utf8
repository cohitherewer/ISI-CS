The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Congress works on DMK deal
                                                                                                           Congress works on DMK deal
          RADHIKA RAMASESHAN                              
	New Delhi, May 22: The Congress and the DMK are trying to reach a compromise that could reinstate two ministers whose tenure had generated controversy but without access to two ministries prone to corruption charges.        
	Sources said the Congress had told the DMK it was willing to accommodate T.R. Baalu, A. Raja, M. Karunanidhis son M. Azhagiri, daughter Kanimozhi and great-nephew Dayanidhi Maran in the new UPA team, but that the southern ally would get neither the surface transport ministry nor communications.         
	Baalu and Raja had earlier held these ministries, which handle contracts worth crores of rupees.         
	The Prime Minister, believed to have initially had reservations about the duo, today said Baalu and Raja were honoured colleagues and there was no controversy surrounding their induction.        
	We hope they will see reason, Singh told reporters after being sworn in.         
	Whatever UPA offered (to the DMK) is reasonable. They (the DMK) are our respected colleagues. We still hope in the next few days they will reconsider their decision, he added.        
	Sources said that if the DMK accepted the deal, it would be offered three cabinet berths  information technology, heavy industries and chemicals and fertilisers  and some ministers of state. In return, it may be asked to consider making the Congress a part of the Tamil Nadu government.        
	Unless things unravel again, DMK nominees of the partys choice are expected to take oath at the second swearing-in early next week.         
	When DMK boss Karunanidhi signalled he would fly back to Chennai this morning  which he did  the Congresss initial reflex had been to hold out. Singh, sources said, had been absolutely clear that Baalu and Raja would not be in his cabinet.        
	But overnight, realpolitik appears to have prevailed. Sources said the Congress chose to go along with the DMK despite the UPAs numbers cushion as the political implications of alienating a major regional party could not be overlooked.        
	After the DMK had threatened to stay out of the government, Sonia Gandhi had held talks with the Prime Minister well past midnight on Thursday.         
	Ghulam Nabi Azad spoke to Baalu and Raja and clarified the issue was not about individuals.        
	Restive signals from allies like Sharad Pawar and Farooq Abdullah also convinced the Congress that it should not let the issue linger and risk a wider round of bargaining.

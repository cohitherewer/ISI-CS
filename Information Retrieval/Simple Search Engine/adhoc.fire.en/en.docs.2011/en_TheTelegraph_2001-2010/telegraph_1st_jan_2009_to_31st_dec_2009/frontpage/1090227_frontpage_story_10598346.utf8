The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Court warns income tax dept
                                                                                                           Court warns income tax dept
          CHANDRAJIT MUKHERJEE                              
	Ranchi, Feb. 26: Jharkhand High Court today asked the income tax department not to shield politicians facing an assets probe by filing voluminous reports in sealed covers, and threatened to bring in the CBI if it was unable to provide details sought by the court.        
	A division bench of Chief Justice Gyan Sudha Mishra and Justice D.K. Sinha rapped the income tax department and the state for filing detailed affidavits and reports when all that the court wanted to know was whether prima facie there was a case of disproportionate assets against former ministers Bandhu Tirkey, Bhanu Pratap Sahi, Dulal Bhuiyan, Kamlesh Kumar Singh and Chandra Prakash Choudhary.        
	The bench observed that the matter had been referred to the income tax department because of its expertise in the matter and threatened to call in a delegation of income tax officers from Delhi to conduct an inquiry against the politicians.        
	The department conducts raids on (the) premises of engineers, businessmen, doctors and advocates, but leaves the big fish (ministers) aside. The department should not have two yardsticks for people in power, the court observed.        
	Pulling up the state government for not following up on the vigilance case instituted against former ministers Harinarayan Rai and Anosh Ekka, the bench asked the advocate-general to report on the findings of the vigilance commission and action taken thereof.         
	The bench took exception to the vigilance and income tax departments filing reports in sealed covers. There is no point in histrionics and filing reports in sealed covers. All that the court wants to know is whether the ministers named in the PIL are guilty of amassing huge wealth as has been stated in the petition. If the answer is not affirmative, then the ministers should not be allowed to be harassed unnecessarily in court, the bench observed.         
	The court fixed March 4 as the next date of hearing and asked the departments to ensure that information on whether the ministers were guilty or not was furnished positively.

                                Merckle                             
	Blaubeuren (Germany), Jan. 7 (Reuters): German billionaire Adolf Merckle has committed suicide, in despair over the huge losses suffered by his business empire during the financial crisis, his family said yesterday.        
	The media-shy billionaire, whose family controls some of Germanys best-known companies, was hit by a train on Monday evening, local officials said. State prosecutors from the city of Ulm said Merckle, 74, left work on Monday and died after being hit by a train near the town of Blaubeuren. He left behind a suicide note to his family.

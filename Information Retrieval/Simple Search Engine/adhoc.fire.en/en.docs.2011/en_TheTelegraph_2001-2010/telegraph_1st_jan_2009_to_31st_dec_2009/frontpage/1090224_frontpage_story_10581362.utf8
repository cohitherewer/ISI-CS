The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | The ninth, this one for resilience
                                                                                                           The ninth, this one for resilience
          AMIT ROY                            Pinki at the Oscars. (AP)                                  
	London, Feb. 23: The number of Oscars won by India-related stories is not eight but nine because to the eight that have gone to Slumdog Millionaire has to be added another awarded to the director/producer of Smile Pinki, an inspiring tale of a girl in rural India born with a cleft lip.        
	Megan Mylan, an American director and producer, won the Oscar for the best documentary short subject which tells how Pinki Kumari has been able to battle not only her physical defect, a common enough condition in India, but also social exclusion.         
	Some might wonder at the coincidence of Oscars going to Indian stories set against the backdrop of unprivileged children but Mylan considers Pinki her heroine for not giving in and persisting with treatment. It is also probably the case that without media attention she would have withered away.         
	The same magic that happens in our film happens every day for children with clefts all around the world because of a terrific organisation called the Smile Train, Mylan said.         
	Its a journey story; in some ways its a very simple story, Mylan added. Its a little girl who is born with a birth defect thats very easy to cure, and we follow her on the journey to have that new beginning. Her inner beauty gets to be matched with her outer beauty.         
	She went on: Our film is about a little girl and a little boy, whose name didnt make it into the title, who are both from very, very poor, simple rural villages. They dont have running water, they dont have electricity, and now Pinki is sitting out here at the Oscars. And I was trying to explain to her that not every day of my life is like this. I think she just thinks this is what America is like. We all get dressed up, and she met me in jeans and a T-shirt the first time I met her.        
	Her gratitude was directed towards the girls medical team but mainly to Pinki: Thank you, thank you, thank you for letting me tell your inspiring story.         
	Mylan said: What was wonderful about the social workers and the team at the hospital, they dont blame the parents (for collaborating with the girls social exclusion).         
	You know, society has blamed these parents; they tell them that the daughter was born during an eclipse and the mother was cutting vegetables. And there are all sorts of superstition all around the world that black children are born with a split lip as if the parents have done something wrong to deserve it.         
	Change occurs in Pinkis life, Mylan pointed out: Then the families become educators and they tell the rest of the communities that (treatment is possible). And I hope its not just cleft lips, its just children sometimes arent born in our definition of perfection, and if you can seek out a way to help your child, you should try every resource thats out there.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Priyanka in politics? Never say never
                                                                                                           Priyanka in politics? Never say never

	New Delhi, April 12: Priyanka Gandhi said today she had learnt never to say never, and the Congress heard what it had always wanted to  a yes.         
	In Amethi to campaign for brother Rahul, Priyanka was asked again if she would join politics.         
	As I am growing older, Im realising that never is a bad thing to say. So Im not going to say never, the 37-year-old said. But I certainly dont see it. I dont feel that (joining politics) is what I would do.        
	The party latched on to the first part of the statement, ignoring the rest, even after spokesperson Abhishek Manu Singhvi tried to underplay it.        
	Singhvi said: Priyankaji has spoken clearly and unequivocally. For the present and foreseeable future, No. But she has never said never. Never has a negative element. In any event, she is already part of the Congress.        
	But the mood at the Congresss 24 Akbar Road headquarters was upbeat, as party leaders linked her comment today with her retort to Narendra Modi yesterday.         
	Do I look old? she had responded, asked to comment on the Gujarat chief ministers description of the Congress as a budhiya (old woman).        
	A party functionary said: By pitching herself as the face of the Congress, she has showcased the youthful face and future of the Congress.         
	There is a view in the party that Priyanka made the comment in recognition of her mothers destiny. Sonia Gandhi had repeatedly ruled herself out of politics through 1991-97 but gave in after many leaders, including Mani Shankar Aiyar, Suresh Kalmadi and Aslam Sher Khan, quit in 1997.         
	In a jibe at Priyanka, Modi today called the Congress a gudiya (doll) party.         
	But she was dismissive: I think it is ridiculous. I dont know why we are discussing budhiya and gudiya. We should be discussing economic development. We should discuss things that count in politics.         
	In Priyankas charisma, the Congress sees an answer to its problems in states like Uttar Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh where the party organisation is in disarray and it desperately needs a leader to enthuse workers and polling booth managers.         
	During the 2007 Assembly polls, Priyanka was in Amethi with her children when a local party leader walked up to her with a packet of jalebis. The septuagenarian had said: Bitiya, main jalebi bachchon ke liye laya hoon (I have brought jalebis for your children).        
	Priyanka grabbed the sweets and savouring one, replied: Wah chacha, hamare liye kyon nahin? The man was in tears  a bond had been cemented.        
	But the Gandhi daughter, who called herself a half-politician today, has said again and again that she is not looking for a career in politics. Even yesterday, she said: I will not join politics. You have been asking this question for 20 years.        
	Priyanka stressed she was only fulfilling her duty towards her mother and brother by campaigning in Rae Bareli and Amethi while they toured the country.         
	So who did she want to win with a bigger margin, Sonia or Rahul? I am the younger sister of Rahul, so I want that he should win with a little more votes, she quipped.        
	The sister also rooted for her brother becoming Prime Minister one day while making it clear that Manmohan Singh was the partys candidate for the post for this election. I have full faith in my brother. He is hardworking. He means well. He is, according to me, qualified.... So, one day he will. He will do a good job of it.        
	But before that, she would like to see him in another role. Asked if she would rather that Rahul became a groom first or a Prime Minister, pat came the reply: Dulha.

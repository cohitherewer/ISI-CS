The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Guru takes on Guruji
                                                                                                           Guru takes on Guruji
          GAUTAM SARKAR                              
	Dumka, March 24: Guruji Shibu Soren will come face to face with his guru if he contests the Dumka Lok Sabha seat.        
	For, former deputy chief minister Stephen Marandi has decided to field veteran JMM leader and Shibu Sorens mentor Nanda Lal Soren as a Jharkhand Jan Morcha (JJM) candidate from there.        
	Dont underestimate my candidate. He is heavier than Shibu, said Marandi, who continued to be the thorn in the flesh for Shibu ever since he lost the Tamar by-election and gave up the chief ministers chair.        
	Marandi, who was the first to resign his Assembly seat and meet the governor to pressure Shibu into resigning as chief minister, is himself contesting the Rajmahal Lok Sabha seat.        
	But he seemed more excited about his Dumka coup. My candidate will certainly cut into the JMMs support base in Dumka, he declared.        
	Apart from Dumka, Shibu is keeping options open by also contesting the Jamtara Assembly byelections to be held on April 23, the day Dumka too goes to the polls.        
	Nanda Lal, the man who is said to have introduced a young Shibu to Santhal Pargana in the early 70s, left the JMM in 2005 and joined hands with Marandi who was then nursing a bruised ego at being denied a Dumka ticket.        
	A resident of Jamtara, the retired school teacher recalled his first meeting with Shibu , then a young man with long hair and flowing beard, in 1968 at Maraphari police station in Bokaro.        
	I was impressed with the way he dealt with the police stations officer-in-charge who was apparently being unfair to a tribal boy. The boy wasnt at fault but the policeman wanted to punish him. But, Shibu saved the boy, Nanda Lal said.

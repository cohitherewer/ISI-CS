	Sept. 21: At least three persons from Assam, two of them women, were reported to have died in the earthquake that struck Mongar district of Bhutan along with some parts of the Northeast this afternoon.         
	Journalists from Bhutan attending a seminar in Kokrajhar in Assam called up their country and confirmed the deaths.         
	The three have been identified as Mira Boro, Pushpamani Barman and Mohan Praja all of whom were working as daily labourers there.        
	The Regional Seismological Centre in Shillong measured the intensity of the earthquake to be 6.2 on the Richter scale and the epicentre in Bhutan, around 125km northwest of Guwahati.        
	The tremor was also felt in the four Bodoland districts of Kokrajhar, Chirang, Baksa and Udalguri, along the border with Bhutan. The quake rocked parts of north Bengal and Sikkim as well.         
	Another aftershock was felt a few minutes after the first big earthquake, which hit the region around 2.23pm. As windowpanes rattled, tumblers fell from tabletops and highrises shook alarmingly, panic-stricken people ran down several floors to reach the safety of open spaces.         
	The impact of the earthquake was felt most in Guwahati and Shillong but there was no report of any loss of life or destruction of property in Assam or Meghalaya.        
	People in other parts of Assam as far as Jorhat in Upper Assam and Dhubri in lower Assam too felt the tremors though the intensity was much less.         
	Todays was the fifth earthquake to have hit the region, but what worried the people more was the largely upward progression in the intensity of the tremors.         
	An earthquake measuring 4.9 on the Richter scale shook the region on August 19 while another measuring 5.6 struck on August 11.         
	Another earthquake was felt on the night of August 31 and measured 5.3 on the Richter scale. Then another earthquake hit parts of Assam and Meghalaya past midnight on September 4 measuring 5.9 on the Richter scale.         
	In Shillong, the morning began with heavy rain, accompanied by thunder that lasted for almost an hour.         
	Meghalaya chief secretary Ranjan Chatterjee said the government had not received reports of any quake-related damage.

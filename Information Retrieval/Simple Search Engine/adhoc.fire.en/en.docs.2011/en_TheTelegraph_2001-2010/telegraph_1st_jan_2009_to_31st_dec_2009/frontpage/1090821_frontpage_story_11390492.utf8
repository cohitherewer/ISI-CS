The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Extra time for VIP quota 
                                                                                                           Extra time for VIP quota 
          CHARU SUDAN KASTURI                               
	New Delhi, Aug. 20: Admissions to Kendriya Vidyalayas have been extended by a month  only for students applying through the discretionary quota of human resource development minister Kapil Sibal.         
	The Kendriya Vidyalaya Sangathan (KVS) has directed all its schools to admit the ministers nominees till August 31  the last date was July 31  after Sibal was unable to nominate enough candidates to fill his quota on time, top officials told The Telegraph.         
	Other students who may have missed the admission deadline, however, have not been provided any succour in the directive issued on August 13.         
	Strict instructions be given to all principals of your region not to refuse admission under special dispensation scheme of HRM (human resource minister) on the ground that the last date (31st July) for admission is over, the directive said.         
	The HRD minister, under rules upheld by the Supreme Court, is allowed a quota of 1,200 seats at the KVs every year. The country has over 1,000 KVs with close to 1.2 million students.         
	Ministry sources independently confirmed the KVS directive but clarified that Sibal had personally made no such request. The move appears to be a departure from the propriety-conscious approach of the HRD ministry under Sibal.         
	The directive effectively widens the gap in admission opportunities for ordinary students and the ministers nominees. Now, a student nominated by the minister need not even meet the deadline, a source complained.         
	The ministry sources said the minister had been busy trying to meet 100-day targets, allowing him little time to shortlist nominees.        
	Sibal is learnt to be opposed to the concept of a quota for the minister. But the minister is known to be burdened with hundreds of applications for admissions to the KVs  from aides, party workers and acquaintances.         
	Requests for admissions through the ministers quota, however, start several months in advance.        
	Sibals predecessor in the ministry, Arjun Singh, had nominated close to 1,000 of the 1,200 students in the ministers quota for the 2009-10 academic session before he quit office.

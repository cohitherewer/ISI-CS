          SANJAY K. JHA                                                   
	New Delhi, Dec. 11: A flustered Congress leadership tonight began mulling a second states reorganisation commission (SRC) to put a lid on the cascading demand for new states triggered by Telangana.         
	The party hopes a new SRC  mandated to consider all demands  will become an instrument to defuse Telanganas domino effect which has begun to echo loud from many parts of the country, including Darjeeling, Assam, Uttar Pradesh and Bihar.         
	Uttar Pradesh chief minister Mayavati dropped an opportunist tackle in the troubled waters today with a suo motu announcement she was ready to carve out Bundelkhand and a Harit Pradesh out of her state.        
	RJD leader Lalu Prasad revived the demand for a new Poorvanchal comprising the Bhojpuri-speaking districts of Uttar Pradesh and Bihar. There is a palpable fear that older small-state demands like Vidarbha and Bodoland may resurface and force a drastic redrawing of the Indian map.         
	In Andhra Pradesh, the eye of the current storm, the Centres announcement on Telangana has unleashed a huge counter-tide. More than 135 members of the Assembly have resigned in protest and chief minister K. Rosaiah has been left to field an anti-Telangana surge many in the Congress had not expected.         
	I have not been asked either orally or in writing to move a resolution for Telangana in the state Assembly, Rosaiah said today in an effort to placate anti-division anger. Congress MPs from Andhra Pradesh have been tasked by the central leadership to persuade party MLAs not to resign and instead to defeat the Telangana resolution on the Assembly floor should it come about.         
	Congress leaders privately conceded that they had not foreseen the violent repercussions of the announcement on Telangana and argued that the Centre had moved only to prevent an ugly turn in the face of fasting TRS leader K. Chandrasekhar Raos deteriorating health.         
	The ruling party has suddenly realised its defensive move has unleashed offensive posturing from the protagonists of smaller states, like the sudden eruption of Gorkhaland agitators in Darjeeling. Mayavatis political adventurism too has pushed the Centre into thinking of instituting a second SRC.         
	Some leaders, however, said no formal decision had been taken on the second SRC and the posturing by Mayavati was little else than a political joke. But they conceded that the government would have to create an institutional mechanism to study the demands instead of taking arbitrary decisions.         
	The Telangana announcement was made under an extraordinary situation. Every decision cannot be taken by the Congress core committee. A second SRC is very much an option being considered, a minister said.         
	On Telangana, too, there were very tangible signs of a slowdown. Congress leaders said the premise on which the government had suggested a resolution in the Assembly was apparent consensus among the key political players, which seems to have broken.        
	In the circumstances, passing a resolution appears impossible and that will make it incumbent on the government to take a fresh look at the entire situation and try to evolve a consensus first.         
	There is definitely some unease among a section of leaders who feel the door is being closed after the horse has bolted. Somebody obviously was misleading the leadership. We could have shown similar caution before committing that midnight blunder. The party could have announced a second SRC at that time instead of making Rao the father of Telangana and injecting life into other such demands, an AICC functionary said.        
	Many leaders believe the midnight declaration was political sacrilege.         
	Agitated Congress MPs from non-Telangana regions met Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, home minister P. Chidambaram and the partys main troubleshooter Pranab Mukherjee to lodge their protest.         
	After these meetings, the MPs appeared pacified to some extent and expressed the hope that Telangana hadnt become a reality yet.

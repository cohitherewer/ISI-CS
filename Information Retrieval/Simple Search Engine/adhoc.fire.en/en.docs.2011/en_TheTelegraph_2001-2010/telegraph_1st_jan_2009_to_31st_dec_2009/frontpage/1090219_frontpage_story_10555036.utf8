The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | IT dreams crash with fraud
                                                                                                           IT dreams crash with fraud
  - 31 final-year Rourkela students duped of Rs 50000 each          PRIYA ABRAHAM                            Sector V, Salt Lake, in Calcutta                                         
	Bhubaneswar, Feb. 18: Thirty-one budding software engineers of an engineering college in Rourkela were cheated of Rs 50,000 each by a dud IT firm in Calcutta that had promised them jobs.        
	The money had been deposited by the students of Padmanava College of Engineering as surety during campus recruitment a couple of months ago.        
	Infogen Global, the Calcutta-based firm, conducted a recruitment drive for a batch of students graduating this year in September 2008. Company executives also made a pre-placement presentation to the students.        
	On February 10, trainees of the IT firm  operating out of Salt Lakes Sector V for three years  filed cases against chief visionary Anirban Ghosh and his management team for duping them with cheques that bounced. Soon after, the company was found locked with 400 on its rolls rendered jobless overnight.        
	None of the office staff or the directors is at the office, nor is anybody receiving calls, confirming the company had motives of fraud, said college principal A.L. Kundu. Earlier this week, the college convened a meeting of affected students. Venting their ire against the college, the students boycotted classes on February 13 with the first and second-year students joining them this week.        
	We are all equally pained at this unethical treatment, Kundu said.        
	Till now, only one of the directors, Jharna Chandra, has been arrested.        
	Padmanava College of Engineering also lodged an FIR at the Bidhannagar East police station at Salt Lake on Monday.         
	Rahul Barua, a final-year computer science student, said: The company promised us Rs 7,000 for the first three months during the training period.

                                                                                                           ONLY WAVE IS HEAT WAVE
  - Summer sadism on those willing to vote 
										      Cithara Paul and G.S. Mudur                                            Amit Ukil of The Telegraph tracked booth number 242/143 at Purulia Zilla School in Purulia, one of the hottest districts in Bengal, from the start of polling to the end to record how some voters braved the heat and what made them do so      
	New Delhi, April 30: Voting today was about one per cent inspiration  needed to brave the scorching summer sun and make it to the booth  and 99 per cent perspiration.              
	Citizens keen on exercising a democratic right oozed buckets of sweat with the maximum temperatures five to six degrees above normal at many places in northern, central and eastern India that voted in the third phase.        
	The heat was one possible reason for low turnouts at many places  early estimates put the countrywide figure at 50 per cent. Bengals western parts, where the mercury rose three to seven degrees above normal, saw 60 to 76 per cent polling but this was lower than the 2004 turnout.         
	Summer Lok Sabha polls are a recent practice, the first April-May elections having been held in 1991. There have been two more since, in 1996 and 2004.        
	A weather scientist said April and May were widely seen as months of discomfort, while February or November would be more comfortable. The difference in mid-February and mid-April temperatures at some places in India could be 12 degrees Celsius, an India Meteorological Department scientist said.        
	Earlier, organising elections in summer was unthinkable, an Election Commission official said. But with political instability setting in, the election schedule went haywire. Now we have no option but to hold them as and when they come up.        
	But the government of the day has the power to recommend advancing the elections by a few months.         
	Earlier, Lok Sabha elections were held in February, but now elections are held in summers when the temperature is almost 43 degrees. I feel that if the Lok Sabha and Vidhan Sabha elections are held at one time it will enhance the participation of people, L.K. Advani said after casting his vote in Ahmedabad.        
	The February or March elections in 1957, 1967, 1977 and 1998  and the November or December polls in 1984 and 1989  witnessed more than 60 per cent polling. Ditto for the first elections, stretched from October 1951 to February 1952. In contrast, the three summer elections saw a highest of 58.07 per cent polling, in 2004.        
	Nor are summer elections ideal for Indias vast farming community. April and May are busy months for farmers in most parts of the country, said Ujagar Singh Walia, head of agronomy at the Punjab Agricultural University, Ludhiana. In northern India, wheat harvesting and threshing occurs during April, and farmers sow cotton during May.        
	Rice farmers sow the seeds in nursery in May, another agriculture expert said.        
	In February, Walia said, farmers are relatively less burdened. It depends on what they are cultivating, but they have more time on their hands in February.                  
	Poll panel officials, however, say that matters arent so simple. The countrys size and varied climate, the possibility of floods or drought  all influence the timing of elections.        
	During winter, some constituencies may be snowbound and during the rains, some areas may be cut off, an official said. Besides, election dates have to take account of exam schedules, religious festivals and public holidays too.        
	For voting to be shifted out of summer, there has to be a mid-term poll or the government has to call elections a few months early.        
	Whatever this elections results, here may be something for politicians to ponder: the voter wasnt the only one to suffer in the past three summer polls, the government of the day too failed to make a comeback.

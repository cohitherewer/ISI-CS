The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | President plays, Cong sweats
                                                                                                           President plays, Cong sweats
          SANJAY K. JHA                              
	New Delhi, Sept. 22: The Congress and the NCP announced a 174-114 seat-sharing arrangement for the Maharashtra polls late tonight after President Pratibha Patils hard lobbying for son Rajendra Shekhawat and a few other candidates caused an embarrassing hold-up in the announcement.        
	With three days left for filing nominations, the Congress high command was faced with a bizarre impasse created by Indias First Lady who, as constitutional head of the nation, is not expected to indulge in politicking of any sort, least of all for family.        
	Highly placed Congress sources told The Telegraph that at one stage, Patil herself called defence minister A.K. Antony, who is also in charge of Maharashtra affairs, to ensure her son got the nod.        
	In what might indicate that Rashtrapati Bhavan was getting its way, Maharashtra chief minister Ashok Chavan said Shekhawat had every right to enter the electoral fray.        
	The debate among Congress leaders from Maharashtra centred mostly around Rajendra Shekhawat, whose ticket has become a prestige issue.        
	The sitting Amravati MLA, Sunil Deshmukh, a highly rated young minister who enjoys the backing of a majority of his cabinet colleagues, refused to oblige the high command and threatened to contest as a rebel candidate. A proposal to accommodate him elsewhere failed to break the impasse.        
	The Congress leadership admits the wrangling over Shekhawats candidacy has been extremely damaging both for the party and Rashtrapati Bhavan. Sources said that the President was believed to be pushing for a few more of her acolytes in the Maharashtra Congress, most of them belonging to her Rajput caste.        
	Sources said the party tried its best to persuade Sunil to opt out as ignoring the Presidents wish would be difficult.         
	Sunil, who has been in Delhi to argue his case against the overpowering influence from Rashtrapati Bhavan, was told by chief minister Ashok Chavan and a few central leaders that the party could not be seen as rebuffing the President at a time other veterans had managed tickets for their relatives.        
	Sunil refused to buy this logic and expressed his determination to contest from the same constituency. The Presidents son, known as Raosaheb, Sunil contended, would prove a weak candidate in comparison.        
	Sunil apparently warned the leadership that his rebel candidacy would adversely affect the prospects of the Congress in the entire Vidarbha region. Sources said former chief minister Vilasrao Deshmukh saw merit in this argument and opposed the case of the Presidents son.        
	Although most senior leaders feel the prospects of the Presidents son are not very bright, the high command appears unwilling to ignore his case as some of Patils other recommendations were not given much importance.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Chicago in clear on Headley
                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                Chicago in clear on Headley
          K.P.NAYAR                               
	Washington, Dec. 28: The government of India has absolved its consulate in Chicago of any wrongdoing in issuing a visa to half-Pakistani David Coleman Headley, now in jail in the US accused of terrorism.        
	The episode may, however, have driven yet another nail into the Sharm-el-Sheikh spirit in India-Pakistan relations, which have already been in an intensive care unit following a change of guard in the countrys diplomatic service.        
	The original visa papers of Headley were traced and communicated to New Delhi just before the Christmas holidays. They reveal that false information in the Washington-born mans application led consular officials in Chicago to believe that he had no links with Pakistan and that he was a regular sort of WASP or American of White Anglo-Saxon Protestant origin.        
	In the column of the visa application on page one where Headley was to have filled his name at birth  Daood Gilani  he misled Indian officials in Chicago into believing he was born with his assumed American Christian name.        
	Similarly, on the second page of the application form, where an applicant is required to fill in his fathers name and nationality, Headley deliberately gave the false information that his fathers name was William Headley and that the father was a natural American.        
	The correct information would be Syed Saleem Gilani, father, and Pakistan, his nationality.        
	A terrorist applying for a visa with intent to plan violence cannot be counted on to state the truth, which might have thrown up red flags among consular officials.        
	For officials in South Block, might is the key word because they are now using the Headley episode to mount a campaign against efforts in other sections of the government that are being held responsible for an overall laxity in issuing visas to Pakistanis.        
	External affairs ministry officials are no longer hiding their irritation over policies which actively encouraged the so-called people-to-people contacts with Pakistan. Indian diplomats blame those policies for a progressively lax approach in allowing Pakistanis to visit India.        
	Part of this approach may, however, be defensive on the part of South Block.        
	While the consulate in Chicago has emerged unscathed from the Headley visa handling, that may not yet be so in the case of his accomplice, Tahawwur Hussain Rana.        
	Although Rana is a Canadian citizen, his name is a clear red flag. Besides, his passport, which was in the possession of Indian officials in Chicago for stamping the visa, clearly shows that Rana was born in Chichawatni in Pakistan.        
	Headley, on the other hand, was born in Washington.         
	A circular issued by the Union home ministry four-and-a-half years ago, which was challenged then by South Block before Indian missions abroad were firmly told to implement it, has now become a serious bone of contention between North Block and the MEA in the context of Ranas visa.        
	The circular exempts Canadians and US citizens of Pakistani origin from being mandatorily referred to New Delhi when they apply for Indian visas.         
	When the issue of Ranas Pakistani origin was brought up for this story, an Indian diplomat flaunted with ill-concealed contempt a revised version of this circular, issued in 2007, which reiterated that Americans, Canadians and several other nationals of Pakistani origin were not required to be subject to secondary scrutiny in New Delhi for visa purposes.        
	The diplomat insisted, therefore, that the consulate in Chicago would be exonerated fully in the Rana episode as well.        
	In addition to the exemption from secondary scrutiny for Americans and Canadians of Pakistani origin, South Block said such people were to be particularly encouraged if they were going to India on business visas as part of a deliberate policy in New Delhi to encourage third-country trade between India and Pakistan as part of an attempt to thaw India-Pakistan relations all round.        
	Rana was issued a business visa which is said to have been backed by comprehensive documentation that overrode any case in favour of referring his application to New Delhi in terms of the home ministry circular.

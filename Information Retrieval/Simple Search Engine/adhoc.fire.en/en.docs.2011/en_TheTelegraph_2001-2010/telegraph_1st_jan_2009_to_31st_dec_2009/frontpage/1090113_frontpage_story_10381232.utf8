          MUZAFFAR RAINA                             Mallya                                  
	Srinagar, Jan. 12: Liquor baron Vijay Mallya today promised to bring the good times back to Kashmir, but sowed the seeds of a controversy by saying he would revive the cultivation of hops used in manufacturing beer.        
	The cultivation of hop  the female flower cones are used as an ingredient  has been opposed by separatists who are against the sale and consumption of liquor in Kashmir.        
	Mallya, a friend of National Conference patron Farooq Abdullah, said investment opportunities in the state topped his agenda.         
	We need hops for beer and are keen to restart its cultivation and processing in the state. We will look at potential opportunities. I will look at the Optrex plant at Zainakote industrial estate and find out whether I need to re-acquire it in this new regime which is full of promise and hope, Mallya, whose United Breweries owns the Kingfisher brand, said.        
	Mallya owned the Optrex plant  which manufactured eye drops  in Zainakote on Srinagars outskirts before militancy erupted in the Valley. He said the crop facility for hops, used to balance the sweetness of the malt with bitterness, and the processing plant was destroyed by militants.        
	Cultivation of hops started in Shilvat (in Kashmir) in 1973. It was a successful project based on import substitution. The cultivation of hops was highly appreciated. Our facility was inaugurated by the Sher-e-Kashmir (Sheikh Abdullah). But in 1989-90, the entire crop facility processing plant was destroyed by terrorists or insurgents. That was the end of the project, he said.         
	Sources said indigenous yield of hops would benefit beer manufacturers in India, most of whom depend on imports from countries like Germany and the Czech Republic, one of the largest producers in the world.         
	Separatist groups said they would oppose the revival of hop cultivation. We do not know if the National Conference is behind this. But if there is any such move, we will oppose it with our full might, said Hurriyat leader Maulvi Abbas Ansari.        
	The government was cautious in reacting to Mallyas desire. Let him first approach us with a proposal. We will have to consider it then. It is too early to say whether we will allow or reject it, said finance minister Abdul Rahim Rather.         
	Mallya also announced he would promote Kashmir tourism in foreign countries through his Kingfisher Airlines.         
	Kingfisher will go beyond flying and offer tourism-specific packages to sell Jammu and Kashmir in different parts of India and overseas. Our staff in Europe will sell tourism as a complete package. We will bring tourists here, arrange their hotels, sight-seeing, surface transport and golf, he said.        
	The Kingfisher boss said he was also toying with the idea of operating an international flight from Srinagar to Dubai via Delhi. It is a little early to say when and where to fly. What immediately comes to mind is to have a flight from Srinagar to Dubai via Delhi. We will have customs and immigration in Srinagar, he said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Now, BJP working on Soren
                                                                                                           Now, BJP working on Soren
  - NDA sends feelers to JMM chief, pitches for Arjun Munda          SUDHIR KUMAR MISHRA                                    
	Ranchi, Jan. 24: JMM chief Shibu Soren returned to the state capital today from his ancestral village of Nimra amid speculation that he was considering an offer from the BJP to try and set up an alternative government with the support of the NDA.         
	Soren, who was in Nimra to mourn the death of his younger brother Shankar, held a closed door meeting with Girinath Singh, a special emissary of RJD chief Lalu Prasad yesterday. And according to party sources, he was, in fact, keeping his options open.        
	BJP mediators were trying to convince Sorens elder son Durga that the JMM was free to explore the possibility of forming an alternative government in the state with their support. The tie-up, they said, would help the JMM in the coming Lok Sabha polls, too.         
	A BJP MP is said to be at the centre of negotiations and Soren was apparently being asked to consider Arjun Munda as the chief ministerial candidate if he apprehended opposition within his own party on the question of the top job.        
	Munda, the sources said, had his roots in JMM and was a widely accepted tribal leader. Also, during the next Lok Sabha elections, the NDA was apparently ready to cede the four seats currently being held by the JMM. And doors were open for talks if Soren wanted more seats, said the sources.        
	Senior JMM leader Dulal Bhuiyan, a former minister, did not deny there was such a move, but maintained it was being discussed by Durga and BJP leaders in their personal capacities. The issue, he said, had to be discussed by the partys central executive committee.        
	The central executive committee is the supreme body in our party. We will sit together and identify our friends and foes. Only then can we decide whether we should severe ties with the UPA and join hands with the NDA, he argued.        
	State unit BJP chief Raghubar Das said nothing was impossible in politics. The BJPs national council meeting would be held in Nagpur in February when a number of issues  including Jharkhand  would be discussed.        
	Earlier, Governor Syed Sibtey Razi held a meeting with senior officials, including chief secretary A.K. Basu, before leaving for Lucknow.         
	He is scheduled to return tomorrow to take part in the Republic Day functions.

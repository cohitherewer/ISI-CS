                                                                                                           Lalgarh jawan hit by bullet
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Midnapore, Aug. 17: For the first time since the Lalgarh operation began on June 18, a policeman has taken a direct hit at the fag-end of an encounter with Maoists.        
	CRPF jawan Chalant Kumar Rai took a bullet in his waist today just as a team of state and central forces was preparing to leave the Madhupur jungles in Salboni around noon after a two-hour gun battle.        
	The middle-aged man was brought to Midnapore Medical College Hospital and was being driven to Calcutta late tonight to be admitted to SSKM Hospital for treatment to a damaged nerve. His condition is stable.        
	The Lalgarh operation had so far had two casualties among the security forces, but none from encounters. A BSF jawan died of sunstroke on the Bhimpur-Lalgarh road on June 20 and the same day, a policeman suffered a minor splinter injury after an IED planted by the Maoists exploded in Kadashole village.        
	District police chief Manoj Verma said 100 rounds were fired during todays encounter, which took place about 12km from Lalgarh town. The encounter had just stopped and the jawans were returning to their camp. Suddenly a bullet came from the jungles and hit the jawan.        
	A police officer said about 100 personnel from the Pirakata camp had left for the Madhupur jungles, 7km away, on a tip-off about a Maoist gathering. As soon as the jawans entered the jungles, bullets came flying from behind trees.

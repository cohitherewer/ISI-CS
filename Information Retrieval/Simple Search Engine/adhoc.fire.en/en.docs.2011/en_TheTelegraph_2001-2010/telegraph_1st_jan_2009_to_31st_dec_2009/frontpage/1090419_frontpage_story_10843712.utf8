	Port of Spain, April 18 (Reuters): President Barack Obama yesterday greeted and shook hands with Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez in an impromptu meeting where the anti-US leader told him: I want to be your friend.        
	Photographs released by the Venezuelan government showed Chavez, a fierce foe of former President George W. Bush, smiling warmly and clasping hands with Obama at the start of the Fifth Summit of the Americas in Trinidad.        
	We shook hands like gentlemen. It was obvious it was going to happen, Chavez told reporters after the opening of the summit in Port of Spain. President Obama is an intelligent man, different from the previous one.        
	Relations between Opec member Venezuela and its key oil client the US have been frayed since Chavez came to power and positioned himself as Cubas closest ally and a standard-bearer for anti-US sentiment in Latin America.        
	Obama met the Venezuelan firebrand at the start of his first encounter with Latin American and Caribbean leaders, where he reached out to the Americas by offering a possible new beginning with former Cold War foe Cuba.        
	A senior US official said Obama initiated the encounter, walking across a room where leaders were lining up ahead of a welcoming ceremony to introduce himself to Chavez.         
	Chavez presented the US leader with a book, The Open Veins of Latin America, by Left-wing Uruguayan writer Eduardo Galeano. Obama accepted the gift with a smile.        
	New start with Cuba        
	Obama sat down with South American leaders today, saying he was ready to listen and learn after promising a new start with Cuba.        
	Obama told leaders his administration wanted a new beginning with Cuba to try to end an ideological conflict. Obama said he also was open to discuss with Havana issues ranging from human rights to the economy but he has demanded political reforms from the island.

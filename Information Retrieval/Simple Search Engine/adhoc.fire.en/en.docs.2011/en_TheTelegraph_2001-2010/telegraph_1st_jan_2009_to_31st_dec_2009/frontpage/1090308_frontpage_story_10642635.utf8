The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Howrah plus 1 on Mamata table
                                                                                                           Howrah plus 1 on Mamata table
          OUR BUREAU                              
	Calcutta/Siliguri, March 7: Mamata Banerjee is believed to be considering a Congress proposal to offer Howrah and another south Bengal seat to the latter.         
	Congress sources indicated that the other seat could be Dum Dum, which Mamatas former ally BJP had contested in 2004. Since Mamata had given the seat to the BJP the last time, it is easier for her to allot it to the Congress, they said.        
	The Congress general secretary in charge of Bengal, K. Keshava Rao, told The Telegraph from Delhi: The alliance with Mamata Banerjee is through. We shall announce the list of candidates jointly with Mamataji tomorrow or the day after. Rao said he had discussed the alliance with Sonia Gandhi during the day.        
	The Congress is desperate to mark its presence in south Bengal. As of now, south Bengal is Mamatas territory with little Congress presence.        
	Earlier, Mamata had indicated that she was prepared to leave Krishnagar in Nadia for the Congress in addition to the eight seats she had already offered in the first round of talks with state Congress chief Pranab Mukherjee and Rao.        
	State Congress leaders, however, had complained that all the eight seats were unwinnable. If Mamata offers us Howrah and another south Bengal seat in addition to Krishnagar, it could compensate for the unwinnable seats, one of them said today.        
	Mamata said there was no uncertainty over the alliance. I am still waiting for the Congress to make its stand on the alliance public. But I dont think there is any uncertainty over the alliance.        
	If Mamata agrees to spare three more for the Congress, the number of seats with its candidates will rise to 17, including the six already represented by the party. Observers said that 17 seats, irrespective of the constituencies, would go a long way in meeting the Congresss aspirations. In 2004, Mamata had offered the BJP 13 seats. The Congress, a much larger party in Bengal, expects its share of seats to reflect its size.        
	In Siliguri, Mukherjee said: I told the Trinamul leadership that the alliance should be formed in a way so that both the parties can increase their seats equally. If that does not happen, a wrong message will go out to the rank and file.

          SAMANWAYA RAUTRAY                              
	New Delhi, Aug. 8: Doctors must tell patients about the risks involved in any line of treatment they are following, the Supreme Court said yesterday while ruling on the Anuradha Saha medical negligence case.        
	It added that the doctors who treated Anuradha, who died in 1998 in Calcuttas AMRI hospital allegedly after a steroid overdose, had not done this.        
	Patients by and large are ignorant about the adverse effects of a medicine, the court said. If some medicine has some adverse effect or some reaction is anticipated, he should be informed. It was not done in the instant case.        
	The court said doing this was especially important when the line of treatment is a contested one and hazards are involved, and added that in such cases, doctors must inform their patients about alternative treatments.        
	Whether or not a doctor kept a patient informed about the pros and cons of a line of treatment would be considered in every medical negligence case, the court said.        
	It upheld the acquittal of three doctors from the charge of criminal negligence but accepted the right of Anuradhas husband, NRI doctor Kunal Saha, to seek compensation and awarded him legal costs to be paid by the hospital and one of the doctors.        
	The court observed that the treatment protocol for patients suffering from toxic epidermal necrolysis (as Anuradha was), such as limited steroid use and other supportive care, had not been followed.        
	The court went by medical opinion that the mortality rate was high in cases of steroid use. If that be so, we feel the doctors should have treated the patient (with) more care and caution. We are, therefore, of the opinion that the universally accepted medicated treatment protocol had not been followed, it said.        
	The apex court rapped Calcutta High Court for making a spate of accusations against Saha instead of being sympathetic to him. The high court had said Sahas interference in the treatment had contributed to Anuradhas death.        
	In spite of a possibility of him playing an over-anxious role the breach of duty to take basic standard of medical care on the part of (the) defendants is not diluted, the apex court said.        
	One of the acquitted doctors, Sukumar Mukherjee, had prescribed steroids twice a day without even being sure of the disease Anuradha was suffering from, the court said.        
	Another, Dr Baidyanath Halder, failed to monitor her vital signs, and the third, Dr Abani Roy Choudhury, had not offered any supportive care, the court observed.        
	Of the two other doctors who had treated Anuradha, the court said Dr Balaram Das had stood by without applying his mind, but clarified that Dr Kaushik Nandy, a plastic surgeon, had followed the standard protocol.        
	The court said the hospital had failed to keep proper records of the treatment regimen or to carry out routine follow-up examinations, and noted that it did not have a burns ward, necessary for dealing with such patients.        
	It was brought on record that no nursing home in Calcutta has a separate burns ward. Absence of burns ward by itself, thus, might not be a contributory factor although existence thereof was highly desirable keeping in view the treatment protocol.

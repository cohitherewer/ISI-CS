The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Govt emits leniency gas
                                                                                                           Govt emits leniency gas
  - LPG plan activated to let more autos run as real test begins        OUR BUREAU                                                
	Calcutta, Aug. 2: As the city braces for its first weekday tomorrow since the vehicle pollution ban hit its streets, the government has worked out a plan of leniency that will allow some of the banned auto-rickshaws to operate.        
	Under the plan that the government believes will not invite the high courts wrath, the number of autos on the streets may rise to 13,000 over the next few days. Only 2,800-odd were left plying after the ban on polluting commercial vehicles came into force on Saturday.        
	We have decided that all the two-stroke autos registered after August 2000 can apply to the public vehicles department (PVD) for conversion to LPG. If they can produce the departments acknowledgement of their application, they can ply freely on city roads, state transport secretary Sumantra Chowdhury said.        
	Despite it being a Sunday, the department began accepting such applications with a sense of urgency today.        
	Of the citys 70,000 two-stroke autos, banned under a high court order, an estimated 10,000-plus were registered after the year 2000. With the three-wheelers the hardest hit by the ban, even this figure could substantially ease commuters hassles. The move may also help the government buy peace with the powerful auto unions.        
	The Telegraph had reported on July 10 that the government had drawn up the LPG strategy to interpret the high court order in favour of a section of auto operators. According to a senior state pollution control board official, the 2000 cutoff date had been decided in the light of an Automotive Research Association of India (ARAI) certification issued in November 2007.        
	The ARAI certificate states that if two-stroke autos manufactured after August 2000 convert to LPG, their emission quality will satisfy the prevailing Bharat Stage II norms, the official said. Such an improvement will not be seen with autos manufactured earlier.        
	However, green activists said the government should have taken court permission before coming out with the leniency plan.        
	The decision to allow conversion after the expiry of the July 31 deadline amounts to contempt of court, emission expert S.M. Ghosh said.        
	Government counsel Shovanlal Hazra, however, claimed the court had only banned petrol-driven two-stroke autos. There is no problem in allowing two-stroke LPG autos to ply. We dont even need any permission from the court to allow the conversion, he said.        
	If necessary, the government may draw parallels in court between what its doing and a 1998 Supreme Court order that directed all pre-1990 autos  that is, those more than eight years old  to be replaced with CNG vehicles.        
	Jawed Shamim, acting deputy commissioner of police (headquarters), confirmed that the police would not crack down on autos whose drivers can show the original copy of the PVD acknowledgement.        
	The auto drivers can buy LPG kits, priced Rs 10,000-12,000, from any ARAI-approved company. The kits can be fitted into the autos, which will be converted into single-mode LPG vehicles in a single day, said Sovandeb Chattopadhyay, leader of the Trinamul Congress-backed Auto Bachao Committee.        
	But if an operator wants to replace his two-stroke auto with a four-stroke LPG auto (priced at Rs 1.26 lakh), he will need a bank loan of Rs 95,000 and will have to wait at least two to three months.        
	The Auto Bachao Committee has now demanded the scheme be extended to all two-stroke autos and will hold a rally tomorrow to press the demand.        
	CPM labour arm Citu, too, will organise a rally tomorrow in protest against the government sloth that had slowed the LPG conversion process earlier, and the absence of adequate LPG stations in and around the city.

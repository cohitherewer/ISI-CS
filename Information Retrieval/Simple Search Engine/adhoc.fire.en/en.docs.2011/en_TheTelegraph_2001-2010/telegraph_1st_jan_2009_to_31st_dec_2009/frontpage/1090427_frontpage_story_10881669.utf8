The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Poll-high Lanka vetoes truce 
                                                                                                           Poll-high Lanka vetoes truce 
          OUR BUREAU AND AGENCIES                              
	April 26: Sri Lanka has dismissed as a joke a unilateral ceasefire declared by the Tamil Tigers, ignoring an Indian appeal and vowing to press ahead with an offensive that appears to have paid rich electoral dividends to the government in the island nation.        
	Guns opened up elsewhere in the Indian neighbourhood, too. Pakistan has launched an offensive against the Taliban in the Dir region, which neighbours Afghanistan and the beleaguered Swat Valley. ( )        
	In Lanka, the Tamil Tigers, confined this evening to a 5sqkm strip in Wanni in the north, asked the international community to pressure the government into halting its campaign, saying the humanitarian crisis can only be overcome by the declaration of an immediate ceasefire.        
	 The rebels said in a statement e-mailed to the Associated Press that they would immediately stop fighting. The UN and others, including India, have been pushing for a truce to allow civilians to escape as reports have grown of starvation and casualties among those trapped by the fighting.        
	The Tigers truce declaration came as the UNs humanitarian chief reached Lanka to press for the protection of civilians.        
	But Lanka defence secretary Gotabhaya Rajapaksa said: It is an attempt by the LTTE to deceive the world and get time for them to regroup. There is no meaning for a ceasefire at this time with a losing force like the LTTE. It is a joke.        
	The UPA government, eager to inoculate itself against any backlash in Tamil Nadu if Tiger chief Prabhakaran is captured or killed, sent two emissaries to Lanka last week. The envoys claimed the response was positive and they expected a cessation of hostilities but todays statement suggests any halt will be on the island nations terms or will be dictated by the decimation of the LTTE.        
	If the Congress-led UPA was hoping to address its electoral compulsions  Tamil Nadu accounts for 39 seats that have a habit of tilting en masse in one direction during each poll  the Lankan government is already cashing in on local sentiments there.        
	Lankan President Mahinda Rajapaksas coalition has won a resounding victory in Western Province in an election, seen as a referendum on the fight against the Tigers. The coalition also won in Colombo, long a stronghold of the Opposition that wants talks with the LTTE.        
	In a sign the rebels are feeling the pressure, 23 insurgents surrendered.

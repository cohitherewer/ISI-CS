The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | JMM flexes muscles, tests UPA nerves
                                                                                                           JMM flexes muscles, tests UPA nerves
          JAYESH THAKER AND SUDHIR KUMAR MISHRA                            Durga Soren                                  
	Jamshedpur/Ranchi, March 17: The Congress may have flaunted a pre-election seat sharing arrangement with the JMM in New Delhi, but back home in Jharkhand, the rank and file of the JMM are doubtful whether the deal will last.        
	For, led by party chief Shibu Sorens son, Durga, a section of the JMM feel it is quite pointless to continue an understanding with the Congress which did not stand by the party in the time of crisis and help it form an alternative government in the state.         
	Though senior leaders like JMM Rajmahal MP Hemal Murmu, the man who spearheaded negotiations in New Delhi, and MLA Dulal Bhuiyan  he met Soren in New Delhi last night  are hopeful, various sections of the party continue to remain sceptical of their claims that the alliance was intact.         
	More so after Durga declared in Dumka yesterday that the JMM would contest all 14 seats in the state and enter into an alliance with UPA partners only after his father, Shibu Soren, was reinstated as chief minister.        
	How funny, Baba is yet to recover and is not in a position to speak properly. How come seat adjustments with the Congress and RJD has been completed? he asked, referring to Shibu Sorens ongoing treatment at AIIMS in Delhi.        
	Back from Delhi, senior JMM leader Mathura Prasad Mahto said late tonight the party would be staking claim to the Hazaribagh and Koderma Lok Sabha seats as well. A final list of candidates would emerge after a rally in Ranchi on March 23 followed by a meeting of the partys central executive the next day.        
	The JMMs statements have rattled the state Congress. In Jharkhand, UPA unity does not look good, state Congress president Pradip Balmuchu told The Telegraph.         
	He said if the alliance collapsed, the Congress would field candidates in all 14 Lok Sabha seats in the state.         
	According to the understanding with the JMM, Congress will contest six seats with sitting party MPs  Ranchi, Lohardaga, Khunti, Dhanbad, Godda and Singhbhum.        
	The JMM will contest Jamshedpur, Dumka, Rajmahal and Giridih.         
	Senior JMM leader Champai Soren admitted to the rift in his party. Their grievances arent unjustified, but the BJP might sweep the polls in Jharkhand, if the UPA partners arent united, warned the man projected by Shibu Soren as the chief minister after he lost the Tamar by-election.                    WITH INPUTS FROM GAUTAM SARKAR IN DUMKA

                                                                                                           CID seeks warrant in nun rape case
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Bhubaneswar, Feb. 3: The CID has moved the court to issue non-bailable warrants against 20 accused who were allegedly involved in the nun rape case at K. Nuagaon in Kandhamal and other associated crimes on August 25.        
	On January 29, the investigating agency had filed a chargesheet in the court of Baliguda sub-divisional judicial magistrate, Dolagovind Barik, against 10 persons, who were arrested earlier in connection with the nun rape case.        
	Home secretary A.P. Padhi told reporters today that 20 persons had been identified as a part of the mob who were apparently involved in the nun rape case and associated crimes at K. Nuagaon on August 25 during communal riots.         
	Since those persons were at large, the court was moved to issue non-bailable warrant against them, he said.        
	The investigating team, led by Dillip Kumar Mohanty, filed a petition for this at the Baliguda court, said CID sources.         
	If the persons are arrested and evidences are available against them, an additional chargesheet would be filed in the court, the sources added.        
	So far, the 29-year-old nun has identified main accused Santosh Patnaik, alias Mitu, and his accomplice, Kartik Pradhan, during the test identification parade held at Choudwar circle jail on January 5.         
	The other eight accused persons charged by the CID were Jhuria Pradhan, Saroj Bhadei and his son Muna, Tapas Patnaik, Biren Sahu, Somnath Pradhan, Gajendra Digal and Jharalal Behera.        
	In a related move, the CID has also filed chargesheet in the same court the next day against seven accused persons in the murder of VHP leader Swami Laxmananda Saraswati on August 23.         
	Duryodhan Sunamajhi, Munda Badamajhi, Sanatana Badamajhi, Bijay Sanseth, Gananath Chalanseth, Bhaskar Sunamajhi and Buddhadev Naik have been charged under Sections 302, 449, 380, 120(B) and 34 of the IPC and Sections 25 and 27 of the Arms Act.        
	Since the accused have denied their involvement in the monks murder, the CID has decided to conduct brain-mapping and narco-analysis test at the State Forensic Laboratory in Bangalore.         
	The tests are expected to be complete within a month, said the home secretary.        
	He added that the SFL, Bangalore, would be requested for expeditious conduct of these tests in case of delay.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | JMM: Lamb for slaughter by choice
                                                                                                           JMM: Lamb for slaughter by choice
  - Sorens illness leaves partys national candidates in the lurch           SUDHIR KUMAR MISHRA                                    
	Ranchi, May 9: Faced with an uncertain future at home, the Jharkhand Mukti Morcha used these elections to test the waters in national politics, having fielded candidates in as many as nine states and one Union Territory outside Jharkhand, including Tamil Nadu and Pondicherry where voting is due on May 13.         
	The JMM is putting up candidates in Kancheepuram, Chennai Central, Ramanathpuram, Villupuram, Kallakurichi and Pondicherry Lok Sabha seats. But just as in the other states its contesting, the prospects of party candidates dont look too bright, what with party chief Shibu Soren unable to campaign as he is confined to a hospital bed, ironically in Chennai.        
	Its a desperate, last minute scramble for funds for the candidates who feel let down by the party machinery after being pushed to fight elections in what is an unfamiliar territory for the JMM.        
	I spoke to Sorens private secretary M.L. Pal and senior leader Sudhir Mahto and others, requesting them to lend necessary support. But no one helped, said the JMMs south India co-ordinator, T.P. Ambedakar, over telephone.        
	Early this week all the candidates came to me and pleaded helplessness. Then I ultimately spoke to Sorens son, Hemant. This too proved futile.        
	The party has fielded real estate dealer Pakkiri Ambedakar in Kancheepuram; social activist K. Nagmani is contesting the Central Chennai seat; another petty contractor, R. Panjanabhan, is contesting the Villupuram seat; while A. Kesavan, a village headman who runs a small retail business, will be trying his luck in Kallakurichi.

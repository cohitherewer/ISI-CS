The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Rebels vacate Siroy after 14-day siege
                                                                                                           Rebels vacate Siroy after 14-day siege
          OUR BUREAU                               
	Feb. 2: The 14-day Siroy siege ended today with the 30-odd Naga militants holed up in the Ukhrul village finally moving out.        
	 On Saturday, Union home minister P. Chidambaram had said the Centre would consider further talks with the National Socialist Council of Nagalim (Isak-Muivah) only after the camp was vacated.        
	The militants vacated the camp this morning. We ensured that they did not go to any place other than a designated camp. The cadres were allowed to move with their weapons, Assam Rifles spokesman Maj. Samsher Jung said.         
	The troops surrounded the camp in Siroy on January 19 after the militants who are not allowed to camp outside Nagaland according to ceasefire ground rules, refused to give up their arms or move to a designated camp.        
	A senior government official in Ukhrul told The Telegraph over phone that the troops escorted the cadres out of the camp.         
	Barring the report that the cadres vacated the camp, the Assam Rifles did not disclose the destination of the cadres, the official said.         
	For the past fortnight, the Assam Rifles has tried a number of tactics to force the Naga militants to leave the camp.        
	They first offered safe passage to the rebels, provided they moved to a designated camp  an offer the militants declined. Next, the troops cut off food, water and electricity supplies to the camp, hoping that the rebels would surrender once they ran out of ration.        
	Two days ago, however, the troops provided food and drinking water to the cadres after they heard that the rebels were on the brink of starvation. But the push that seems to have worked is the Centres condition that any negotiation with the NSCN (I-M) would depend on the Naga rebels adhering to the ceasefire ground rules.         
	The NSCN (I-M) chairman, Isak Chishi Swu, said at the outfits 29th raising day celebrations yesterday that the outfit was committed to resolving the protracted Naga imbroglio through peaceful means and was against any attempt to settle issues through military might.         
	In Siroy, Assam Rifles troops dismantled the bunkers and other structures put up by the cadres at the camp.         
	Neither the Assam Rifles nor the district administration disclosed the strength of the cadres but sources said there were 30 of them.        
	The villagers, who had been mounting pressure on the troops to pull out first, today thanked both the Assam Rifles and the NSCN (I-M) cadres for reaching an amicable solution.         
	The district administration provided Rs 50 lakh for villagers relief.

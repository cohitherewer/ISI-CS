                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                Dumka panic after fresh posters
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Dumka, Nov. 22: Hand-written posters, purportedly put up by Maoist rebels, urging people to boycott the poll process, have created panic in the tribal heartland of Santhal Pargana in the last 24 hours.         
	No development, no vote. No vote for capitalists. No vote for a government that allows police to open fire on innocent tribals at places like Kathikund, read the posters that appeared in different areas of Jama-Massaliya block in Dumka district and also in parts of Kundohit and Nala blocks of Jamtara. The posters, reportedly put up by the outlawed CPI(Maoist), have not only spread panic among voters but have left the police confused.        
	They have also triggered a blame game among politicians who claimed that the posters were not the handiwork of Maoists but of their political rivals. Congress candidate from Dumka, Stephen Marandi, alleged that his rivals were trying to divert his votes in places like Massaliya where he enjoys a solid support base. JMM leader Sharmila Soren, who today visited Massaliya and Jama, also alleged that the posters were a conspiracy by her rivals. The local BJP camp echoed similar sentiments.        
	The Maoists  who have made inroads in Santhal Pargana recently  allegedly issued the posters last night.                           
	The posters appealed to voters to boycott the polls and establish a true democracy by adopting revolution and long-term struggle.        
	Sources in Dumka said since the polls in the district are in the third phase on December 8, most policemen from the district are on deputation in other parts of the state. We are busy providing security and other arrangements for VIPs who are campaigning here, said a top police official in Jamtara. He refused to elaborate on the central forces deployed in the area.        
	A.S. Natarajan, the Santhal Pargana inspector-general of police, however, said the district police was on high alert and the police chiefs had been asked to beef up security measures. We have more than adequate forces and are conducting raids to ensure free and fair polls, he said.        
	Reports from Jamtara said the Maoists had their support base at Kundohit, Narayanpur and Nala  the poverty-ravaged pockets of the district.

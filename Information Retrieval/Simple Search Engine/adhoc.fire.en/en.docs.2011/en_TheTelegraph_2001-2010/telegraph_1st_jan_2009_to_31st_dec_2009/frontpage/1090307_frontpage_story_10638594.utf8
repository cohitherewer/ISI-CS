The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | IPL hope with home price
                                                                                                           IPL hope with home price
          SAMYABRATA RAY GOSWAMI                              
	Mumbai, March 6: The Indian Premier League will not be postponed, but franchisees may have to sacrifice their home grounds on certain days in the interest of security.        
	As of now, the tournament will be played as scheduled between April 10 and May 24, but with some changes in match dates to fit in with the five-phase elections. The inauguration venue has been shifted to Mumbai from Jaipur for security reasons.         
	We want to assure cricket fans and everyone involved with the event that the IPL is on, IPL commissioner Lalit Modi said here today.         
	Modi said a revised schedule would be released soon, ensuring there was no clash with polling in any city or state. Its a cumbersome process, because there are blackout dates in several cities because of elections, he said.         
	There will be no match anywhere on May 16, the day of counting.        
	Modis comments came shortly after home minister P. Chidambaram, who had earlier suggested a rethink on the dates following the Lahore attack, assured IPL organisers of adequate security.         
	We will extend all support to the IPL to conduct the matches smoothly but some changes are unavoidable, the minister said in Hyderabad.         
	IPL sources said they were looking at neutral venues to avoid any date clash. The plan is to shortlist some neutral venues where franchisees can play matches on days when they cannot play on their home ground for security reasons, said an IPL source.        
	IPL has drawn up a list of 14 venues, including the current match centres: the home grounds of each of the eight franchisees. Under the existing schedule, Visakhapatnam was the only addition to the list as a catchment centre of the Hyderabad Deccan Chargers.         
	IPL sources said besides the Andhra port town, the other neutral venues being considered were Nagpur, Vadodara and Ahmedabad.        
	Some franchisees, however, said they were wary about playing at neutral venues.        
	Gate revenues are an important source of income for us. But collections at neutral venues may not match that of a home ground. Also, the logistics of sharing gate receipts needs to be worked out. In case matches are played at neutral venues, we will demand that all teams play an equal number of games at these centres, said an IPL team source.        
	But Kolkata Knight Riders officials were not too worried.        
	With (superstar-team owner) Shah Rukh (Khan) and (captain) Sourav (Ganguly) on our side, our star and glamour quotient is high and unlike others, our fan following is not region specific, said a KKR source.        
	IPL officials said rescheduling dates and venues was a tough call, but were confident of finding a solution.        
	The plan is to have one match a day, instead of two as in the last IPL season. Weekends will see four matches played over Saturday and Sunday, instead of three like last year, said an IPL source.

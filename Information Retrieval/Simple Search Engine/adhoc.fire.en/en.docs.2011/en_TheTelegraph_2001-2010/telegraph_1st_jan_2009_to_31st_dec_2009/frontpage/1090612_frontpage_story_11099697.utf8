The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Karat flies into blunder chorus
                                                                                                           Karat flies into blunder chorus

	Calcutta, June 11: Prakash Karat watching, most delegates to a CPM post-mortem have termed a huge blunder the withdrawal of support to the UPA government and the drive for a third front.        
	The CPM state committee today began a two-day session to examine the factors responsible for the worst-ever debacle for the Left. The exercise was carried out in the presence of Karat and politburo colleagues Sitaram Yechury and S.R. Pillai.        
	Although the politburo had earlier admitted that the third front experiment was a failure, its members close to Karat, like M.K. Pandhe, had refused to call the withdrawal a blunder and insisted that both the highest party fora had ratified it unanimously.        
	Several speakers today held both central and state factors responsible, but most, including some defeated party MPs, described the withdrawal of support as a godsend to the Opposition here.         
	The withdrawal was a most ill-timed and ill-conceived political blunder. It only helped the Trinamul Congress and the Congress to unite against us when we were on a sticky wicket over Singur and Nandigram and became politically most vulnerable in 32 years of Left rule, a speaker said later.         
	We gained nothing politically from the withdrawal since the common people hardly understood or bothered about the nuances of our opposition to the nuclear deal. The voting along with the BJP against the trust motion of the Manmohan Singh government and the subsequent third front experiment proved equally disastrous, said another delegate.        
	It was pointed out that, in the process, the party lost a sizeable portion of not only minority votes but also that of the middle class, which opted for the Congress-Trinamul alliances plank of stability and secularism.         
	None of the central leaders spoke today but Karat is likely to address the meeting tomorrow. Most delegates spoke in Bengali but the gist was translated for the central leaders. Yechury understands Bengali well and speaks the language a little but it is not clear whether Karat and Pillai, both with roots in Kerala, caught the nuances in the arguments.        
	Several delegates said free and frank discussions at a level rarely seen before were held on the first day.        
	Among the former MPs who spoke were Howrahs Swadesh Chakraborty, Dum Dums Amitava Nandi and Diamond Harbours Shamik Lahiri. One defeated MP likened the withdrawal of support to the historic blunder of not allowing Jyoti Basu to become Prime Minister.        
	But one of them defended Karat and another added that the state governments failures were also responsible. Chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee did not speak.        
	The tide of opinion in the first round suggests Bengal leaders would like to reopen the withdrawal issue and the subsequent tactical moves at the politburo and central committee meetings in Delhi from June 19 to June 21.        
	Officially, the party sought to strike a balance. State secretary Biman Boses preliminary report today was well-balanced between the central and state factors, some participants said.         
	Bose didnt question the withdrawal but attributed the debacle to both the voters rejection of the third front as well as the anti-incumbency factor in the state.        
	The local factors that came up included the land unrest in Nandigram and Singur, the governments poor performance in rural areas and the failure of delivery mechanism at all levels. Corruption and nepotism were also referred to.         
	Post-poll violence in some parts of the state also crept in. Many members spoke of the growing sense of insecurity among the rank and file in the wake of a post-poll terror campaign by Trinamul and the changed attitude of police.        
	Earlier, we were criticised for police excesses in Singur and Nandigram and we held the force in check in Lalgarh. Now they are turning their back on our workers and supporters who are at the receiving end of the Opposition terror, a delegate said.

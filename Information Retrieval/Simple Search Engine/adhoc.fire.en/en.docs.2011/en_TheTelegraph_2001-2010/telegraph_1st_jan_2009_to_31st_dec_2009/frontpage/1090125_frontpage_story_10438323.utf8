The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Model who lost hands, feet dies
                                                                                                           Model who lost hands, feet dies
                                Mariana Bridi                            
	Rio de Janeiro, Jan. 24 (AP): A Brazilian model whose feet and hands were amputated following a drug-resistant infection died early today, health officials said.        
	Mariana Bridi, 20, died at 2:30am from complications related to a generalised infection caused by the bacteria Pseudomonas aeruginosa, the Espirito Santo State Health Secretariat said. The bacteria is known to be resistant to multiple kinds of antibiotics.        
	Bridi had been in the hospital in the city of Serra in Espirito Santo state since January 3. Doctors originally diagnosed her with kidney stones in December, local media said. But as her condition worsened, she was diagnosed with a urinary tract infection that spread.         
	It reduced the flow of oxygen to her limbs, causing her feet to be amputated last week and her hands this week. Part of Bridis stomach was also removed as doctors tried to contain internal bleeding, local media said.         
	Health officials yesterday said Bridi was not breathing on her own and was undergoing hemodialysis at a hospital in the city of Serra.

( The Telegraph pictures)                                Calcutta, July 22 (PTI): The city observed 91 per cent of the total solar eclipse despite a cloudy sky early this morning.  The sun looked like a crescent as the moon's shadow passed between the sun and the earth for a few minutes from 6:20 AM.  People gathered on rooftops and at vantage points to have a glimpse of the celestial event, though the eclipse was partially visible here.  Hundreds of people descended on the Hooghly river ghats to have a dip during the eclipse.  Several NGOs, and scientific organisations organised viewing of the event besides the Birla Museum which organised a projection of the eclipse on screen for viewers

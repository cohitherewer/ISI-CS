The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | CPM takes the wheel of Nano politics
                                                                                                           CPM takes the wheel of Nano politics
				       OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                          
	Calcutta, March 23: The Nano may not have rolled out of Bengal but the CPM cant let Nano politics go, particularly when the party thinks it will pay dividend in the polls.         
	As Ratan Tata greeted Mamata Banerjee with a terse good afternoon at the Mumbai launch, Bengal industries minister Nirupam Sen rapped the Trinamul chief for her destructive politics, which robbed Bengal of the chance to cradle the Nano.        
	The people will definitely respond to this destructive politics, he said in a reference to the coming polls.         
	This is an unfortunate day for Bengal. The car that has drawn admiration across the world was scheduled to roll out from our state, Sen said.        
	The most destructive and irresponsible politics of the states main Opposition party has not only shattered the dream of Bengals younger generation but also tarnished the states image. I dont know what the party and its leader have achieved by driving out the project. Their brand of politics (is) dangerous for the state.         
	Referring to Mamatas poll promise  food for everybody, job for all  Sen said: If the exit of a project like the Nano doesnt bother her, the mismatch between her slogans and deeds becomes clear.         
	He slammed Mamatas new ally, the Congress, for its bid to weaken the Left. The Left Fronts appeal to voters, drafted by the CPM, had mentioned Singur but not Tata Motors aborted project or the Oppositions role in it, apparently to avoid reopening the fissures within the front.        
	But chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjees and Sens aggressive campaign blaming Mamata for derailing Bengals industrialisation has made it clear that the party hopes to harvest the misgivings of the young and urban voters to offset the erosion in its rural support base.         
	Asked about the CPM setbacks in the panchayat polls, even in Singur, Sen said some people were confused for some time.         
	I feel particularly sorry for the people of Singur who had cherished a dream that the Oppositions politics shattered, he added.        
	Many in the CPM may have accused the Tatas of taking a hasty decision on the pullout, but Sen praised the group. The Tata group always had a positive attitude towards investment in Bengal and we hope they would come up with bigger investments.        
	However, he ruled out the return of the Nano to Bengal, at least in the near future. There was no discussion on (the return of) Nano with them.        
	Asked whether the state would urge the Tatas to come back with the Nano or some other automobile project in Singur, Sen sounded sceptical.        
	The investment and market scenario have changed in the automobile and other industries because of the slowdown. If there are opportunities, the state will try to exploit them.         
	Sen iterated the governments resolve to set up new industries on the acquired land in Singur but remained non-committal on their nature.

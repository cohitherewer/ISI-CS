The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | 3000 illegal aliens struck off poll rolls in Orissa
                                                                                                           3000 illegal aliens struck off poll rolls in Orissa
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Cuttack, March 13: Orissa government has deleted the names of 3,000 Bengali-speaking residents from the general election voters list after finding out that they are illegal migrants from Bangladesh.        
	Most of the names are of residents living in villages under Mahakalpada and Rajnagar blocks of Kendrapada, some 120km from here.         
	The Kendrapada district administration recently entrusted enumerators and government officials to inquire and add names of Indian citizens left out of the voters list and asked the administration to delete names of foreign nationals.        
	During an inquiry, officials found that at least 3,000 people were not citizens of India, but illegal immigrants from Bangladesh. Hence, their names were deleted from the list, said Kendrapada collector Sisirkanta Panda.         
	Among those whose names were struck off were a sarpanch, members of Kharinashi and Batighar gram panchayat samitis and several ration cardholders and home owners under the Indira Awas Yojna.         
	They have now urged the district administration for a roll back of the decision. They have also sought the intervention of the chief minister, the Prime Minister, the chief election commissioner and the Chief Justice.         
	In a similar exercise, the Kendrapada administration deleted names of at least 4,000 Bengali-speaking people living in seaside villages from the list in December of 2007.         
	Nearly a year ago, the administration had imposed a 20-year domicile embargo on Bengalis to make them eligible for social security schemes. The settlers in Mahakalapada and Rajnagar blocks have to produce proof stating that they have been staying in the area for 20 years.         
	Unless they corroborated their nativity status, applications of these linguistic groups would not be considered for government-aided social security schemes.         
	Incidentally, the state has little mechanism to help officials differentiate between migrant Bengalis and Bangla immigrants and the language spoken in both the groups make identification even more difficult. The nativity proof measure was part of the exercise to curb illegal immigration from across Bangladesh, official sources said.

	Vienna, May 24 (Agencies): At least nine persons were wounded when armed men attacked a preacher and worshippers in a gurdwara in Vienna today, police said.        
	Local authorities initially reported a shootout between two feuding families but later said the violence involved members of many gurdwaras in Vienna who had been at odds for several years.        
	A police spokeswoman said six suspects had been arrested and that the casualty toll could rise. Austrian news agency APA said 30 people were hurt.        
	Police said the violence began when six men abruptly stood up during a service in the gurdwara in Viennas heavily immigrant Rudolfsheim district and attacked the preacher and other worshippers with a gun and knives.         
	Witnesses said the preacher had travelled from India to Vienna to conduct the service despite members of rival gurdwaras threatening violence if he appeared.         
	Curfew was clamped in Jalandhar tonight and the army alerted as tension gripped the district after the gurdwara attack in Vienna.

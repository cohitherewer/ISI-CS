										                              Jaipur, July 29 (PTI): Charismatic former royal Rajmata Gayatri Devi, who had an eventful stint in politics and was jailed during Emergency, died at a hospital here today following prolonged illness. 	She was 90. 	  Once listed among the 'World's Ten Most Beautiful Women' by Vogue magazine and a style icon during her time, Devi was the founder of the Swatantra Party and was elected thrice to Lok Sabha. 	  She was admitted to Satokben Durlabh Memorial Hospital early this month and was discharged a few days ago but was readmitted yesterday for chest infestion. 	 rdquo;She recovered from her gastrointestinal problems but yesterday she was detected with a lung infection. Her condition deteriorated this morning and she breathed her last at around 1600 hrs, rdquo; Dr Subhash Kala, who was attending on her, said.    The London-born princess of Cooch Behar was the third Maharani of Jaipur from 1939 to 1970 after her marriage to Maharaja Sawai Man Singh II and was later known as Rajmata or Queen Mother. 	  She entered active politics on an anti-Congress plank in 1962 when she founded the Swatantra Party in Rajasthan. She won a landslide victory from Jaipur Lok Sabha seat in 1962 and again emerged victorious in 1967 and 1971. She was lodged in Tihar Jail in Delhi during Emergency.

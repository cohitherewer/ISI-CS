  - Govt stalls Air India shutdown plan, issues ultimatum to pilots         OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                             An Air India passenger headed to Shimla waiting at Calcutta airport on Tuesday. After her 5am flight was cancelled, she had to spend over 12 hours at the airport to board another flight at 5.45pm. Picture by Pradip Sanyal                                         
	New Delhi, Sept. 29: Prime Minister Manmohan Singh intervened tonight to stop the Maharaja from declaring an unprecedented shutdown at the state-owned, loss-laden airline but the government still talked tough by ordering the striking executive pilots to return to work after a four-day agitation or face unspecified action.        
	Air India was forced to cancel all its flights in the morning and suspend ticket bookings for the next 15 days as 200 of its 1,200 pilots called in sick in protest against deep pay cuts. In Calcutta, 10 flights were cancelled, affecting passengers travelling after the Puja holidays.        
	Official sources said the airline had readied plans to declare a shutdown after executive pilots reported sick four days in a row in protest against the 70 per cent cut in productivity-linked incentives (PLI) that make up the bulk of their pay packets.        
	However, Singh stopped the airline from activating the drastic plan.        
	The Prime Minister and civil aviation minister Praful Patel directed the top brass to make all efforts to keep the state-owned airline operational.        
	Earlier in the day, Singh had reviewed the situation with civil aviation secretary Madhavan Nambiar and cabinet secretary K.M. Chandrasekhar. Air Indias chairman-cum-managing director Arvind Jadhav was also present.        
	Patel held out an olive branch to the striking pilots, adding that the pay cuts had not been implemented and could be discussed after they returned to work.        
	There is no pay cut as of now for the executive pilots. The decision will not be implemented without consulting the pilots, Patel said. Please co-operate and join your duties.        
	The executive pilots spurned the ministers appeal and said they would return to work only after an unambiguous assurance from the authorities that there would be no pay cuts.        
	However, more trouble loomed as check engineers  the highest-paid engineers at the airline who face a similar prospect of a 70 per cent cut in their allowances  also struck work.        
	Patel warned: I hope the entire airline will come back to full operation from tomorrow, failing which the management will be free to take any decision that it feels is necessary.         
	Sources said the airline had set a midnight deadline for the resumption of work and would crack down on the striking pilots after that.        
	We are not resuming work tomorrow, said a defiant Captain V.K. Bhalla, who is spearheading the agitation.                     
	The pilot protest has led to the cancellation of over 230 flights over the past four days, with 80 being called off today.        
	Bhalla accused the Air India brass of trying to prolong the stand-off to try and help rival private airlines that have also been badly roiled by the effects of a sharp economic slowdown over the past year. The airline rubbished the charge.        
	Civil aviation secretary Nambiar met officials of private airlines and asked them to accommodate Air Indias stranded passengers. He also asked them not to take advantage of the situation and raise fares  a situation that arose last month when pilots at Jet Airways launched a strike.        
	Jadhav said Air Indias PLI expenditure had ballooned to an unsustainable level of Rs 1,500 crore in the past two years. Half of this amount goes to cockpit and cabin crew and the other half is paid out to the other 26,000 employees.        
	The agitation was sparked off as the airline, which has racked up accumulated losses of Rs 7,200 crore, devised a restructuring plan designed to pare costs in order to qualify for government-backed loan guarantees and a fresh infusion of capital.        
	We understand that no one wants to see a cut in take-home emoluments, said Patel. But at the same time, it is imperative to understand that Air India in its current form cannot absorb the high cost structure.        
	The restructuring plan involves a mix of pay cuts, route rationalisation and fleet optimisation strategies.

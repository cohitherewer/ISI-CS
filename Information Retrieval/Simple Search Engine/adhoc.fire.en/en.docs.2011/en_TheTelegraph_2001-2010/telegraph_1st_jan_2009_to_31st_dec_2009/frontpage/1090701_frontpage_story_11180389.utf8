	Bokaro/Jamshedpur, June 30: The Centre has warned Jharkhand, Bihar, Orissa and Chhattisgarh that more than 7,000 Maoists, many of them armed, have fled Lalgarh in Bengal to sneak into the neighbouring states, forcing the East Singhbhum administration to step up patrolling in the Ghatshila sub-division bordering the troubled spot of West Midnapore.        
	Based on intelligence inputs from the Union home ministry, the inspector-general of the special branch of Jharkhand, Bibhuti Bhushan Pradhan, sent out a letter to all 24 district superintendents of police (SPs), asking them to keep an eye on bus stands, railway stations, hotels, dharamshalas and nursing homes where the fleeing rebels might try and take shelter.        
	High-level sources said Bihars inspector-general of police (operations), S.K Bharadwaj, as well as the additional director-general of police (headquarters), Neelmani, were in touch with senior police officers of Jharkhand, including the inspector-general, D.K Pandey, and the additional director-general, Rajiv Kumar.        
	Pradhan confirmed having alerted all SPs. The SPs have been directed to be extra vigilant around public places, he told The Telegraph from Ranchi.                                
	The warning seemed to have an immediate effect at Chakulia on the Jharkhand-Bengal border, where the police had been put on high alert with jawans of Indian Reserved Battalion (IRB), Jharkhand Armed Police (JAP) and district police dispatched on long-range patrolling.        
	The Bengal police have identified some CPI(Maoist) leaders who had apparently crossed over into Ghatshila from Lalgarh. They include Vikasji, the secretary of the Purulia-Bankura-West Midnapore zonal committee, Kishanji, the politburo member, Kanchan, the Bengal state committee secretary, and Rakeshji, a member of the Bengal-Jharkhand-Orissa border regional committee.        
	Keeping this in mind, the police and paramilitary forces have been directed to scan the jungles and conduct search operations in Chakulia.        
	We are in touch with our counterparts of West Midnapore district to know the latest from Lalgarh, said the East Singhbhum SP, Naveen Kumar Singh. Our forces are on maximum alert.        
	The East Singhbhum district police had on June 19 sealed the states borders with Bengal along Chakulia, Dhalbhumgarh and Ghatshila after security forces launched an offensive against the rebels in Lalgarh.        
	But, due to a slowing down in operations, the forces were withdrawn from the border on June 25. But, the paramilitary forces, including the CRPF, IRB and JAP, were kept on standby at camps in and around Chakulia.        
	The deputy inspector general of police (Kolhan), M.K. Mishra, said the police in Jharkhand were vigilant. We are working in tandem with the Bengal police, he said.

          TAPAS CHAKRABORTY IN LUCKNOW                              
	Ajijur Rahaman Sardar, son of Jamaluddin of Biramnagar, Majherpara, Police Station Basirhat, District North 24-Parganas, shown arrested on June 22, 2007. For: Attempted armed dacoity in Tiljala, Calcutta. Status: Acquitted by court for want of evidence in 2008              
	Ajijur Rahaman Sardar, son of Jamaluddin of Biramnagar, Majherpara, Police Station Basirhat, District North 24-Parganas, shown arrested on June 29, 2007. For: Alleged smuggling of RDX into Lucknow on June 22-23, 2007. Status: Lodged in Lucknow jail awaiting trial              
	A farm labourer from Basirhat in Bengal, arrested on June 29, 2007, for alleged smuggling of RDX into Uttar Pradesh on June 23 that year, was in the custody of the eastern states police from June 22 in connection with another case, reveal charge-sheets filed in the two states.        
	The special task force (STF) of the UP police says Ajijur Rahaman Sardar, 22, is a suspected member of Bangladeshi extremist group Harkat-ul-Jihad-al-Islami (HuJI) and that he and two accomplices had stashed away 2kg of RDX in a field on Lucknows outskirts on the morning of June 23, 2007.        
	The STF charge-sheet claims Sardar and his friends had smuggled the explosives from the Bengal-Bangladesh border into Uttar Pradesh.        
	The chargesheet, filed in the Lucknow additional sessions court on October 8, 2007, says the three men had spent the night of June 22-23, 2007, at Lucknow railway station. On June 23, they hid the RDX in a paddy field at Mohunlalgunj, 30km from Lucknow. They then left for Rae Bareli station to board a train for Calcutta, from where they were arrested by the UP police six days later and produced before the Lucknow chief judicial magistrate on June 30, 2007.        
	The trio are now in high-security terrorist cells at Lucknow central jail. The trial is scheduled to start on July 9 in a special court in Lucknow.        
	However, documents available with The Telegraph reveal that the same Ajijur Rahaman Sardar was shown arrested on June 22, 2007 by the Bengal CID in a case of attempted armed robbery at Tiljala on Calcuttas fringes. The Bengal charge-sheet says Sardar was produced in court from Alipore central jail, where he was lodged.        
	The Bengal CID dropped Sardars name from the charge-sheet for want of evidence in its final report, dated June 30, 2008 (No. 125/08), submitted to the additional chief judicial magistrate, Alipore.        
	If the accused was already under arrest on June 22, 2007, by CID, West Bengal, how could he have stayed that night at Lucknow station with a consignment of RDX? said Mohammad Shoaib, a court-appointed amicus curiae, or legal facilitator, for Sardar.        
	He was arrested in Calcutta on June 22 and there was no way he could have been granted bail the same day. He was booked under sections that required him to be produced before a sessions judge, which is not possible on the day of the arrest.        
	Calcutta and Lucknow are around 1,000km apart. A train journey takes between 20 and 22 hours; flight connections are mostly via Delhi and take between six and eight hours.        
	Shoaib wants to file a bail petition and later an acquittal appeal for Sardar.        
	Sardars alleged accomplices are Mohammad Ali Akbar Hussain and Sheikh Mukhtar Hussain, also residents of Bengal. All three are accused of being HuJI activists involved in smuggling RDX to carry out blasts in UP. Conviction could even bring a life term.        
	A senior UP police officer said the Bengal CID may have handed Sardar over to the UP police. The STF may have tagged him with other accused without checking the history of his arrest in Bengal.        
	In Lucknow, additional director-general of police Brij Lal refused to comment, saying the case was sub judice.        
	Sardars relatives from Basirhat are in Lucknow to consult lawyers. The defence may ask the court to summon the Bengal CID as witness.        
	Sardar is a farm labourer and occasional brick kiln worker. He is married and has a daughter and a son, who was born three months after his arrest by the UP police.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Bruised BJP under siege

  - Vasundhara defies leadership with parade of MLAs in Delhi         SANJAY K. JHA                                                     
	New Delhi, Aug. 14: Vasundhara Raje Scindia, leader of the Opposition in the Rajasthan Assembly, looks set to become the first victim of the intensifying power struggle in the Sangh parivar which, at a higher level, has pitted L.K. Advani against RSS boss Mohan Bhagwat.         
	Scindia brought drama to her defiance today, parading 62 MLAs before party president Rajnath Singh, but top party sources said her move had only served to strengthen the case against her.        
	The party cannot afford to promote the culture of blackmail, the sources added, indicating it was only a matter of time before the high-profile former Rajasthan chief minister was forced to step down. The RSS and many state unit chiefs, they said, had been disenchanted with Vasundharas reaction which oozed arrogance and defiance.         
	Although the party refused to formally respond to Vasundharas act of sending 62 MLAs to Delhi to argue her case, the dominant view was that she would be ousted come what may. There is also no plan to accommodate her at the central level, as the RSS is said to be extremely annoyed with her. Sources said the party president believed yielding to such pressure tactics in one state would open the floodgates and controlling factionalism would become impossible.         
	The unfolding showdown over Vasundhara Raje could, however, just be the first act of an internal crisis that is beginning to unfold. Despite Advanis rebuttal of speculation that he had been asked to step down as leader of the Opposition in the Lok Sabha and choose a successor before the end of the year, Sangh sources affirm that RSS bosses are bent on a leadership change.        
	Advani has been given enough time and opportunity, one of them said, unwilling to be quoted. He had a full term as shadow Prime Minister despite having to quit the party presidentship over his Jinnah remarks, the RSS and the Sangh fully backed his prime ministerial ambitions during the election campaign, now it is time for him to make way, he said.                    
	It is no secret that Rajnath Singh himself is not backing Advanis claim to another five-year term as shadow Prime Minister; on the contrary, the BJP president may be secretly pleased at his current discomfiture, courtesy the RSS. For the time, though, Advani has been able to lobby support among several top second-rung leaders including his Lok Sabha deputy, Sushma Swaraj, and the leader of the Opposition in the Rajya Sabha, Arun Jaitley.         
	Currently, the row over Vasundhara holds centre stage in the party, giving breathing room to Advani. Rajnath Singh met the Rajasthan MLAs who had come to protest at his residence this morning, but expressed annoyance. They should not have come in a group. Two or three could have come, he said, adding bluntly that change in responsibility is a natural process in any political party.... Policy decisions are taken by the central leadership.         
	What further disheartened the MLAs was Advanis refusal to entertain them. The MLAs staged a sit-in for some time at his residence after Advani refused to meet them. Advani and Rajnath had agreed in principle on a change of guard in Rajasthan. That the RSS is in tune with this appears to have sealed Vasundharas fate.         
	Vasundharas supporters submitted a memorandum to Rajnath and Advani, explaining that the partys position under her leadership was better than ever before and she was the only leader with a mass base.

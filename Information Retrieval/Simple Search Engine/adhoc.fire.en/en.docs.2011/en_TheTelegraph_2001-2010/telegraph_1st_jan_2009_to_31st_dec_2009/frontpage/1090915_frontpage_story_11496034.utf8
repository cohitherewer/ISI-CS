The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Boy Rani discovers a world apart
                                                                                                           Boy Rani discovers a world apart
  - Roles juggled without jiggling          AMIT ROY                             Rani Mukerji in London                                        
	London, Sept. 14: Rani Mukerji today listed before London media the hurdles she had to cross to dress up as a young man in order to be accepted into a mens cricket team in her new film, Dil Bole Hadippa.        
	She had to train hard for six months, lose weight and tone her body because I did not want anything jiggling about on the field, the actress said after steeling herself to answer even vulgar questions about anatomy as this was a light-hearted media conference to promote the film.         
	I said jiggling, not jingling, she clarified to one journalist who did not quite grasp the challenge Rani faced. I did not want anything jiggling from the back as well, she added.        
	Sportspeople have to be very fit, she further explained, throwing in a detail that I like cross-dressing.        
	Shakespeare had the same idea when Viola in Twelfth Night had to disguise herself as Cesario. But this time, Ranis character, Veera Kaur, has to put on a moustache and male clothes to pass herself off as Veer Pratap Singh to get into a team skippered by Rohan, played by the very handsome Shahid Kapoor.         
	The main difference between a man and a woman, Rani said in response to one question, was I had to stand with my legs apart thats the difference.         
	Before she started preparing for her role, her interest in cricket was strictly limited, Rani said. I found it boring. I did not even know how to hold a bat.         
	After six months coaching, though not from a famous cricketer, her interest in the game has grown  I can even watch a cricket match  but not to the extent that she would invest Preity Zina-style in an IPL team.         
	Im not that rich, you need lots and lots of money for that, she pointed out. I dont have any money in the bank.

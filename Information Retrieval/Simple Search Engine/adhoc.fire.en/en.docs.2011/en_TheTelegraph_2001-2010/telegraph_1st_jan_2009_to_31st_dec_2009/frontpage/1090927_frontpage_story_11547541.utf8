The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Rat loyal to AI, pilots desert
                                                                                                           Rat loyal to AI, pilots desert
          OUR BUREAU                              
	Sept. 26: Guess who checked in when some pilots ditched Air India? A rat, apparently.        
	A mysterious rodent on an Air India plane today held up a Chandigarh-Toronto flight by nearly half a day before the airline finally replaced the aircraft.        
	The Chandigarh hunt for the elusive intruder nobody wanted to own up to having seen first coincided with a strike by some pilots of the cash-strapped Air India that grounded nearly a dozen flights across the country.         
	Whoever said rats desert a sinking ship must have got it wrong.        
	The strike, over a move to cut productivity-linked incentives by up to half, has forced the state-run carrier to cancel 11 flights. In Calcutta, a flight to Aizawl was cancelled as the pilot reported sick.        
	Air India spokesperson Jitendra Bhargava claimed that flight operations were largely unaffected. Only 11 flights have been cancelled whereas all other flights have taken off since morning, he said.        
	The two main pilot unions, the Indian Pilots Guild and Indian Commercial Pilots Association, have not joined the strike. Air India is scheduled to hold talks with pilots on incentives tomorrow.        
	The protest comes a fortnight after Jet Airways was crippled by a pilot strike. Air India had earned some goodwill then by flying stranded Jet passengers.        
	An Air India insider said the executive pilots who called the strike accounted for 319 of the airlines 1,200 pilots, while a pilot source claimed Capt V.K. Bhalla, who called the strike, enjoyed a following only among about 150 of them.        
	As India and Bhalla wrestle over that number, a hunt is on in Chandigarh to ferret out the lone rodent, if at all it is still the lone passenger on the grounded flight.        
	An airport officer in Chandigarh said every nook and corner of the plane would have to be checked before the aircraft was re-issued an airworthy certificate.        
	Rats on an aircraft are considered dangerous as they can chew through wires and circuits and cause accidents.        
	The 255 passengers and crew finally took off in another plane at 5.26 in the evening, 11 hours after the scheduled 6.30am departure.        
	But nobody would say who saw the rat first. We have asked the Air India staff to give a statement on who saw the rat on the aircraft but we have still not received any word from them, airport director Chinson Panakkal said.        
	Maybe they are too rattled.

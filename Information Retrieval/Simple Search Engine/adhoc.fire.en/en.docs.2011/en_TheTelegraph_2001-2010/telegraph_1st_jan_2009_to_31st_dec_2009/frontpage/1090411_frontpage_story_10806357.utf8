	Los Angeles, April 10 (Agencies): The Obamas are yet to bring home a new puppy, but the Presidents youngest daughter Sasha has already chosen a name for the canine member of the first family  April 1st.        
	The American President and his family had moved into the White House earlier this year and his young daughters chose a Portugese Water dog as a pet, according to Giant magazine. After a long search for a pet, the Obamas finally settled for the particular breed. Michelle Obama said she picked that particular breed because temperamentally theyre supposed to be pretty good.        
	 Malia and Sasha had earlier come up with names like Moose and Frank, but they were rejected by Michelle as boring and common. Sasha then came up with April 1st which was unanimously accepted.         
	Seedlings planted        
	Michelle Obama planted the first fruit and vegetable seedlings in the new White House garden yesterday, assisted by a group of eager school children who tend to a similar garden at their school.        
	An advocate of eating fresh and healthy food, she could be enjoying salads made with lettuce from the garden in about two weeks.        
	Spinach, assorted types of lettuce, herbs, onions, shallots, cucumbers and peas are among the crops planted yesterday. Tomatoes are to follow in about three weeks.         
	Before they got their hands dirty, Obama encouraged the Bancroft Elementary School students to eat more fruits and vegetables and to eat them regularly.

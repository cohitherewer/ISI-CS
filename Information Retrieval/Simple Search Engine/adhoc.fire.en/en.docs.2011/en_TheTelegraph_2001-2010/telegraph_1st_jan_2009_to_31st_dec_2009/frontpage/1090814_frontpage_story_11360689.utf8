                                Paul                            
	Los Angeles, Aug. 13 (Reuters): Legendary guitarist and inventor Les Paul, who pioneered designs of electric guitars, has died of complications from pneumonia at a New York hospital, his lawyer said today. He was 94.        
	 Paul had been a dominant force in the music business since World War II. He and wife Mary Ford enjoyed a string of hits in the 1940s and 1950s.        
	A passionate tinkerer, he created one of the first solid-body electric guitars in 1941. Paul played a key role in the birth of rock roll in the early 1950s.

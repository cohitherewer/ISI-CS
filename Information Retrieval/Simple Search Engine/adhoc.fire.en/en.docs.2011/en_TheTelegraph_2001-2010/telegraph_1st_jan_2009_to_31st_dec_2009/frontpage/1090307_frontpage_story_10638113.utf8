The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | PC hits back after serial slights
                                                                                                           PC hits back after serial slights
          OUR BUREAU                                         Chidambaram, Yeddyurappa: Getting even?                                   
	New Delhi/Bangalore, March 6: The home ministry today issued a release alleging P. Chidambaram had been repeatedly forced to put off a Bangalore visit for a security review because of serial cancellations by Karnataka chief minister B.S. Yeddyurappa.        
	A central ministry issuing a release to publicly blame a state government is unusual, but a ministry official said Chidambaram had been left seething today by the third cancellation of the meeting in four days by the BJP chief minister.        
	Cancellations of security meetings in the run-up to the polls is unusual, and the Centre apparently did not want to miss this opportunity of getting back at the BJP, which has made security a poll plank.        
	Chidambaram has been reviewing the security situation and preparedness in every state before the polls. He was about to leave Mumbai for Bangalore this evening when a message arrived from Karnataka, the official said. It said Yeddyurappa would not be able to attend the March 7 meeting because he wanted to go to his constituency.        
	In the release, issued for the information of the public, especially the people of Karnataka, the home ministry gave the sequence of events.        
	It said the Karnataka government had been requested to organise a meeting on March 4. Karnataka replied the date was not convenient for the chief minister, and was asked to suggest an alternative date. On February 28, Karnataka suggested March 5.        
	However, on March 3, the state said that March 5 was not convenient for Yeddyurappa either. (The) home minister accepted this and requested Karnataka once again to suggest another date, the release said.        
	On March 4, the state suggested a meeting on March 7, to be held between 8.15am and 10.15am. Chidambarams tour programme was sent to the state government but just as he was about to leave, Bangalore sent in the last cancellation.        
	Karnataka home minister V.S. Acharya said: We were ready on March 4 to receive them. Then it was postponed to the 5th and 7th. I cancelled all my engagements and by 7pm I get the message that the (Union) home minister has gone to Delhi from Mumbai. Its not fair to politicise these things.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                            Mamata on Tuesday. (Bishwarup Dutta)                                        
	Calcutta, March 10: Mamata Banerjee today gave an ultimatum to the Congress leadership, saying that she would wait for a maximum of one or two days for the alliance to be worked out and then announce her decision to go it alone in the Lok Sabha elections in Bengal.        
	Mamata said her patience was running out and saw a CPM hand in slow-poisoning the alliance.        
	Congress leaders told me that they would take only 48 hours to get the stamp of approval from Delhi when they had called on me here on March 1. Instead of two, 10 days have passed and I am still waiting. This is too long and too much of a wait and we are losing our patience, she said this afternoon. We are waiting while the CPM is busy capturing walls for its campaign. I feel the CPM is trying to slow-poison our alliance.        
	Mamatas ultimatum need not mean an end to the alliance. But it unmistakably showed that all was not well with the process. It also took the wind out of the speculation that the seat-sharing deal was almost through.        
	On the contrary, Mamata confirmed that the talks had not really advanced beyond the first round when she had offered 14 seats to the Congress, including the six that the latter had won in the 2004 polls. Only one change has since taken place in the list  Mamata agreeing to interchange Bankura and Bishnupur between the two parties.        
	Revealing some details of the talks she had with Bengal Congress president Pranab Mukherjee and the partys Bengal handler, K. Keshava Rao, on March 1, Mamata said she had offered nine seats in north Bengal and five in south Bengal to the Congress.        
	Mamata thus suggested that she had not conceded the Congresss request for winnable seats in south Bengal such as Krishnagar, Howrah, Barasat, Basirhat and Dum Dum. Congress leaders had been given to understand by Mamatas camp that she was willing to part with Howrah but she later said she had made no such commitment.        
	Shall we give away south Bengal seats that we won? For 365 days in a year, we stand by the people, fight (against the CPM) and take bullets, Mamata said.        
	The Trinamul leader pointed out that in the last Lok Sabha polls, the Congress may have won six seats, but it had forfeited its deposit in 31 constituencies.         
	Mamata said she was pained at the way in which some Congress leaders were criticising her party at a time alliance talks were on.        
	But the Congress feels that Mamata has not addressed the core issue. The party believes the seats offered to it are bad ones, where the Marxists have a huge advantage.         
	First, from the Congress point of view, the alliance will make sense only if the party can increase its tally from the six seats it had won in 2004. In the present scheme of seat-sharing, the party feels that possibility seems remote.        
	Second, the Congress thinks its position in national politics is vastly different from what it was in 2001 when it had an alliance with Mamata for Assembly polls. The alliance this time must take this change into account.        
	Third, the Congress is no longer worried about Mamata going back to the BJP. That chapter, according to Congress sources, is closed. Going back to the BJP is no longer an option for Mamata, both because of the 27 per cent Muslim votes in Bengal and the problems within the NDA.        
	Fourth, the Congress leadership is unsure of Mamatas role in the post-poll scenario. In case the Congress has to take the help of the Left at the Centre, a break with Mamata is inevitable.        
	So, unless the Congresss own score in Bengal improves substantially, a big rise in Trinamuls numbers in the Lok Sabha is no incentive for the Congress to go for an unfair alliance.        
	Against all these arguments, some Congress sources claimed that the alliance could be a win-win deal. Since Mamata cannot go back to the BJP or go with the Left-sponsored third front, she has little option but to align with the Congress in national politics. Her gains in Bengal will thus be the Congresss gain in Delhi. And, the alliance, too, can help the Congress win more seats in Bengal.        
	But even these sources argue that it has to be an alliance of mutual gains.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Pitt agency picks Pinto
                                                                                                           Pitt agency picks Pinto
          PRATIM D. GUPTA                                              
	Calcutta, Jan. 13: Freida Pinto, the lead actress of Slumdog Millionaire that won four Golden Globe awards on Sunday, has been signed up by Creative Artists Agency (CAA), which also represents Brad Pitt and Tom Cruise.        
	A month ago, Freida had said: Hopefully, I will do projects in India. I would love to work with Imran Khan. That may have to wait now.         
	With the worlds most powerful talent agency now representing her, a Pitt or a Cruise is a more likely co- star for the middle-class Mumbai girl than Aamir Khans nephew.        
	CAA also represents George Clooney, Julia Roberts, Daniel Craig, Kate Winslet, Nicole Kidman, Penelope Cruz, David Beckham and Cristiano Ronaldo.        
	To be signed up by CAA right after your first film is a huge achievement in itself its like she has arrived, said director Anurag Kashyap. She will surely land plum projects in Hollywood very soon, even if they are the clichd Asian roles.        
	In an interview to The Telegraph last month, the 24-year-old had said of walking down red carpets around the world: Its not every day that a middle-class Mumbai girl gets an opportunity like this and I feel truly blessed.         
	Since then, the CAA dinner, the Palm Springs International Film Festival, the Critics Choice Awards, the Bafta tea party and, of course, the Golden Globe evening have had Freida rubbing shoulders with everyone from Clint Eastwood to Angelina Jolie.        
	Shes also got herself a date with Ellen DeGeneres on her chat show.        
	But Freida, who was just another model till a year back, is not the only one going places because of Danny Boyles Slumdog.         
	The other big beneficiary has been Mira Nairs stalled project Shantaram.         
	Produced by and starring Johnny Depp, the film had got stuck  just 10 days before shooting was to begin  because of the writers strike.         
	With a film featuring Indian actors adapted from a book set in India winning four Globes, getting the cellu- loid adaptation of the Gregory David Roberts book back on track has become a priority.        
	Shantaram, too, is set in Mumbai and has Amitabh Bachchan in one of the major roles.        
	A Los Angeles-based film technician involved with the project said: Even though Depps diary is full till 2011 and even Mira Nairs moved on to her next project about Amelia Earhart (first woman to fly solo across the Atlan- tic Ocean), they will now accommodate the Shantaram shoot. After all, the entire pre- production work has been done.        
	Will Slumdog Millionaire also spell millions for A.R. Rahman and Anil Kapoor in the West? We will find out soon.

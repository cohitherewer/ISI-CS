The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | China executes Briton over drug charges
                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                China executes Briton over drug charges
          AMIT ROY                            Akmal Shaikh: Medically unstable                                  
	London, Dec. 29: China was accused by human rights campaigners today of being still stuck in the dark ages after it went ahead in the early hours of this morning with the execution by lethal injection of a 53-year-old British Muslim for drug offences.        
	The Chinese ignored repeated pleas for clemency from the British government, human rights groups and the family of Akmal Shaikh, from north London, that he should be spared because he suffered from severe mental illness.        
	 In some ways, the campaign on Shaikhs behalf is a dress rehearsal for the drama that is likely to unfold if Ajmal Kasab, the lone surviving terrorist, now aged 22, from the Mumbai massacre, is awarded the death penalty in India.        
	 The two cases are very different  one is a convicted drug smuggler but with an alleged history of mental illness and the other a Pakistani accused of slaughtering innocent bystanders. But as the possible hour of Kasabs execution approached, should he be found guilty, India, too, will come under enormous international pressure to spare his life.        
	Economically dominant China today indicated it does not care for international opinion but how India will react remains to be seen. In Kasabs case, human rights groups will seek to argue that while what he did was horrific, he was probably a vulnerable young man brainwashed by his controllers in Pakistan. They will also add that they expect India to act as a beacon to the world.        
	 The British Foreign Secretary David Miliband declared today: The UK is completely opposed to the use of the death penalty in all circumstances.        
	On his blog, Miliband explained why Britain still wanted to do business with China: Along with every EU country it (the death penalty) is banned in Britain. But not every country agrees. Thats their prerogative. We have said many times we welcome the economic rise of China, and believe its integration into the world system is one of the great opportunities of the 21st century not just one of the challenges.         
	Events like those of today will only fuel the argument of those who say this is an impossible dream, and that the value systems are just too different. I dont believe that. But it is a reminder of how different can be our perspective. We need to understand China (and the massive public support for the execution). They need to understand us.        
	 Gordon Brown, who had personally taken up Shaikhs case in his dealings with Chinese leaders, also issued a strong statement.        
	 I condemn the execution of Akmal Shaikh in the strongest terms, and am appalled and disappointed that our persistent requests for clemency have not been granted, the prime minister said. I am particularly concerned that no mental health assessment was undertaken.        
	 The Foreign Office minister Ivan Lewis, who again summoned the Chinese ambassador for a dressing down, admitted the execution made him sick to the stomach and emphasised China had a responsibility to adhere to the most basic standards of human rights.        
	Shaikhs body will not be repatriated to the UK, and he had been buried quickly in accordance with the Muslim faith. There were expressions of outrage from across the political spectrum and from human rights groups.        
	Conservative leader David Cameron, who might be prime minister after the May general election, said he deplored and deeply regretted the execution.        
	 Shaikhs life has certainly been strange. From Britain he drifted to Poland and then to Urumqi, north-west China, where he was caught with 4kg of heroin in September 2007.        
	According to his daughter, Leilla Horsnell, drug smugglers in Poland had duped her father to act as a courier by promising to make him into a pop star.        
	I am shocked and disappointed that the execution went ahead with no regards to my dads mental health problems, and I struggle to understand how this is justice, Lisa said today.        
	Shaikhs cousins, Soohail and Nasir Shaikh, were given visas by the Chinese embassy in London to travel to China and meet their relative. They were at Beijing airport on their way and said they were deeply saddened, stunned and disappointed by news of the execution.        
	 The group that has taken the lead in campaigning for clemency has been Reprieve, whose director, Clive Stafford Smith, disclosed: Sad to say, I have watched six people die in execution chambers, and it is as ghastly as it is pointless. Is the world somehow a better place today because China refused to show compassion for an obviously ill man? Of course not. Chinas refusal to even allow a proper medical evaluation is simply disgusting.        
	Robert Westhead, spokesman for a charity, MDF, the Bipolar Organisation, which deals with mental health problems, argued: How a society treats people affected by mental illness is always a good indicator of how civilised it is. The way the Chinese authorities have stubbornly failed to take account of this poor mans severe mental illness shows that China is still stuck in the dark ages. This execution is medieval rough justice gone badly wrong.        
	 Figures from Amnesty International show a minimum of 7,000 death sentences were handed down in China in 2008, with 1,700 executions taking place.        
	 Steve Ballinger, a spokesman for Amnesty International, said: China accounts for 72 per cent of the worlds executions and China executes far more than any other country by an awfully long way.        
	 The attitude of the Chinese embassy in London is that Shaikhs rights were respected but no documentation was provided to show he had a history of mental illness.        
	Jiang Yu, the Chinese foreign ministry, spokeswoman, said: We urge Britain to correct their mistake to avoid damaging bilateral relations.        
	According to Philip Alston, a UN special rapporteur, Shaikhs execution amounted to a violation of Chinese and international law.        
	International law points very strongly in the direction of the principle that the death penalty should only be used for crimes which result directly in the death of others, he said. It is time for the international community to mount a much more concerted effort to put an end to these sorts of executions, he added.        
	In the case of Saddam Hussein, the British government, which clearly wanted him hanged, said it was against the death penalty but the decision was one for the sovereign regime in Iraq.

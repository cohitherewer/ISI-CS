The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Ladies fight for Bangla boy   Preity vs Juhi: Knights bring home Mortaza, price no bar
                                                                                                           Ladies fight for Bangla boy     -  Preity vs Juhi: Knights bring home Mortaza, price no bar

	Sinquerim (Goa), Feb. 6: Two Bollywood beauties fought over a baby-faced boy next door at the Indian Premier League auction today, with Juhi Chawla finally bagging Bangladesh pacer Mashrafe Mortaza for the Kolkata Knight Riders.        
	Juhi and Kings XI Punjab franchisee Preity Zinta  leading ladies in many a film opposite the Knights co-owner Shah Rukh Khan  went for the unassuming Mortaza as if Kal Ho Naa Ho, with 83 bids needed to settle the issue.        
	An electric half-hour had passed by then and the 25-year-olds price had shot to $600,000 from the listed base of $50,000. It was the longest bidding in IPL history, and the 12-fold improvement on the base price the steepest ever.        
	The Season II auction saw other peaks too: Englishmen Andrew Flintoff and Kevin Pietersen were bought for a record $1.55 million each by Chennai Super Kings and Bangalore Royal Challengers.        
	But the Bangla fast-medium bowler, whose powerful lower-order hitting is a bonus, was the clear show-stealer.         
	The beginning, however, had as much action as a dot ball.        
	Knight Riders sources had hinted that Mortaza was on their wish list apart from South African batsman J.P. Duminy and Australian quick Shaun Tait. Yet when auctioneer Richard Medley announced the Bangladeshis name, the ladies, in true Bollywood heroine fashion, feigned initial indifference.        
	There was utter silence; no one raised (the electric sabre used for bidding). Then, just before the hammer went down, KKR made a bid. Till then, it had seemed like Mortaza might go unsold, a source from an IPL franchise said.        
	Preitys Kings XI immediately joined the fray. The bids went up by $5,000. When KKR touched $400,000 (on the 71st bid), Medley asked Preity if she was game for $410,000. She was quiet for a while and then nodded, the source said.        
	The bids rose by $10,000 till the Knights touched $500,000 on the 81st. The next bid, from Kings XI, was for $550,000.        
	(Then) KKR hit the match-winning sixer: a $50,000 jump over Punjabs last offer, the source said. The whole thing was very dramatic  there was pin-drop silence in the room and Medley made it even more frenzied by quickening the pace of bidding. It was like speed chess.        
	As Juhi and Preity fought, Kings XI co-owner Ness Wadia, unable to contain his excitement, chipped in towards the end by raising the bids a couple of times. Our budget for Mortaza was $550,000 and we decided to stop after that, Wadia said.        
	Many franchise officials said they felt Kings XI had a strategy to hike the prices by bidding aggressively and then stepping back at the last moment. Their whole intent, it seemed, was to make others finish their money, an IPL franchise source said.        
	It will be very unfair to say that, Wadia countered. We had a wish list and a budget list  we bid accordingly.        
	Buying Mortaza made great sense for the Knights, an agency report quoted IPL boss Lalit Modi as saying. Bangladesh falls under Kolkatas catchment area (under) a proposal we are discussing on letting franchises stage matches overseas. This could work well for KKR later.        
	Mortazas four for 44 set up his countrys maiden ODI win against New Zealand last year. His career, however, has been marred by fitness problems.        
	Im thrilled, the young man said at his three-room rented flat in Dhaka. Only a couple of days ago, the Knight Riders had offered me $150,000 to play for them but I took a chance and waited for the auction. Now Ive been taken for $600,000. Wow!         
	His team will be hoping he shows the same knack for a calculated risk on the pitch.        
	Mortaza was not surprised by the bidding war over him: he told PTI that Kings XI captain Yuvraj Singh had promised to take him into his side.         
	Im awaiting (Knights captain) Sourav Gangulys call, said the youth from Narail in Jessore, which borders Bengal. The team is run by my favourite actor, Shah Rukh Khan.        
	But even SRK  who has starred with Juhi in films like Darr and Yes Boss and with Preity in Veer-Zaara and Kabhi Alsvida Na Kehna  has never been the object of a screen tug-of-war between the two actresses from different generations.             WITH INPUTS FROM FARID HOSSAIN IN DHAKA

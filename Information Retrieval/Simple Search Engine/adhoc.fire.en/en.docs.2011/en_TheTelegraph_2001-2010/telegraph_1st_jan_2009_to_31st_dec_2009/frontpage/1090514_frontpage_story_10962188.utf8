The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | 1952 to 2009, all in family
                                                                                                           1952 to 2009, all in family
          RITH BASU                                              
	Nripa Mishra made her voting debut in 1952, Sayani De cast her first vote this election. But as grandmother and grandchild stepped out of home together to vote on Wednesday, there was little to separate the first and third generations of this Girish Park family in terms of enthusiasm.        
	The presiding officer took a while to find my name on the voters list. That is when I became a little nervous. But the talk I had had with my grandmother about voting helped calm my nerves. On receiving the voter slip, I went to the EVM and pressed the button next to the symbol I had decided on, 20-year-old Sayani, a second-year English honours student at Jaipuria College, told The Telegraph.        
	The only one in the family to feel left out was Sayanis kid sister Saheli, 12. Seeing everyone else in my family go in, I am ruing the fact that I am not old enough (to vote), said the Class VI student of Welland Gouldsmith School, standing outside the booth in a printed top and knee-length tights.        
	For Sayanis parents  Somnath, a Bank of India officer, and Ira De, a Prasar Bharti employee  their elder daughters first visit to a polling booth was a moment to celebrate.        
	We felt great as a family going to the booth together. I personally felt a gush of emotion I just realised that my elder daughter has grown up, Somnath said.        
	Maternal grandmother Nripa, who is in her late seventies, said Sayanis excitement reminded her of how she had felt during the countrys first general elections in 1952. That was the true birth of our democracy, and it was my first experience of voting as well.         
	What did she tell her granddaughter before they went out to vote on Wednesday?        
	I have been telling my elder granddaughter to cast her vote wisely. A vote is a powerful weapon and has to be wielded with caution, Nripa said.        
	The day began early for the family as they prepared to head for the booths they were registered with  Kamala High School for Nripa and Bethune College for Somnath, Ira and Sayani.         
	We hurriedly had tea and butter toast for breakfast before leaving around 11am. We wanted to get to the polling booths before the queues got too long, Ira said.         
	Neither booth, however, had a long queue when the family reached to vote. We were done with it in around half an hour, Sayani said.        
	Back home, Sayani wondered whether she would retain the same excitement for the next election. Maybe I will be enthusiastic to vote again if the candidate I voted for today wins and does good work for the constituency, she said.        
	What if the candidate lost?        
	If the party the person belongs to can be a responsible Opposition, I would not mind it, the 20-year-old quipped in between helping her mother rustle up a meal.        
	Somnath, who has voted in every election since turning 21, said he wanted the new government at the Centre to ensure parity in salaries offered by different private companies to fresh graduates. That way, they would not have to retrench so many people. Losing jobs or the fear of losing jobs drives so many young people to suicide.         
	For Nripa, a safer transportation system tops the wishlist. The government must be stricter with errant bus drivers...they drive so recklessly, causing so many deaths and injuries. I am uneasy till my granddaughters return home from their tuition classes.        
	Ira said she wanted recruitment to resume in government offices so that the youth got more job opportunities.         
	Although her vote does not count, even little Saheli had an opinion on who is the best leader. I would have liked to say Shah Rukh (Khan) because I love him so much. But after the Knight Riders performance in South Africa, I would go for our chief minister (Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee), she said.

          RAJ KUMAR                              
	Ranchi, May 28: Nine CPI(Maoist) activists were nabbed after a police encounter, while three rifles, can bombs, uniforms and urea were recovered from Ulung village under Rania police station area of Khunti this morning.        
	The encounter that began at 9.30 am and continued for 45-minutes, involved 40 police personnel and some 200-odd rebels in Ulung, 40 km from the capital and close to the borders of Simdega, a terrain surrounded by hills and covered by dense forests.        
	Khunti police superintendent Prabhat Kumar confirmed the arrests and booty seize, one of which belonged to Jharkhand police.         
	One out of the three rifles seized was a .303-rifle that is used by the Jharkhand police personnel. Rebels must have looted the gun from a police outpost. However, we are not sure from where, Kumar said.        
	Besides the rifles, Kumar added, Naxalite uniforms were also recovered, along with can bombs, urea  used for preparing explosives  and flap cameras used to ignite bombs.         
	Three can bombs were recovered but we are yet to count the number of uniforms recovered. Besides, we have also recovered empty canvas kit bags used to carry all the equipment, the officer said.         
	The chance encounter began when a joint team of police and CRPF were engaged in a long-range patrolling in the area after receiving a tip-off.         
	While the patrol was on its way, a group of rebels opened fire on them around 9.30am.        
	As an exchange began, the rebels were left with little option other than escape into the nearby village (Ulung), said the officer.         
	After the rebels stopped firing, police cordoned off the village and carried out a search operation that carried on till 5pm in the evening.        
	Afterwards, we drew out eight persons who were neither Ulung residents nor related to the villagers. After a brief inquiry, we ascertained that they were rebels and then mounted pressure on them to help recover arms, ammunition and uniforms from the area.         
	While returning from the village, we arrested one more, a man who doubled up as an informer, he said.         
	Despite the long encounter, there were no casualties and no one was injured in the incident. Police have not prepared a bullet account to ascertain how many rounds were fired.        
	For now, police are interrogating the persons caught.

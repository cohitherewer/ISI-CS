The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Fidelity not essential in relationship: Jolie
                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                Fidelity not essential in relationship: Jolie
          URMEE KHAN                             Not chained                                  
	London, Dec. 23: Angelina Jolie has said that fidelity is not essential for a relationship to work.        
	The Hollywood actress  who raises six children with her long-term partner Brad Pitt  believes open romances can work just as well as monogamous relationships, if both partners agree to it.        
	The 34-year-old met Pitt on the set of Mr. and Mrs. Smith in 2005 while he was still married to the actress Jennifer Aniston        
	She told Das Neue magazine: I doubt that fidelity is absolutely essential for a relationship. Its worse to leave your partner and talk badly about him afterwards.        
	Neither Brad nor I have ever claimed that living together means to be chained together. We make sure that we never restrict each other.        
	However, she added that the couple have a fiery relationship at times. She said: The sparks fly at home if the nice Brad fails to see that hes wrong and reacts in a defiant way. Then I can get so angry that I tear his shirt.        
	It was disclosed last month that Jolie and her father Jon Voight are attempting to reconcile after a public feud of nearly eight years.        
	Voight, 70, the actor, said that he and his movie star daughter have got back in touch and are tentatively trying to rebuild their relationship.        
	The pair have been involved in one of the most famous family feuds in showbusiness since 2001, when Voight told Access Hollywood that Jolie had serious mental problems and pleaded with her to seek help.        
	Relations had already become strained after Jolie learned Voight had an affair behind her mothers back.        
	Jolie dedicated her performance as Christine Collins in the film Changeling, a woman whose son disappears, on her own mother. Jolie said: She was very much Christine Collins. She was very sweet and she would never get angry and she would never swear, but when it came to her kids she was fierce, so this was very much her story.

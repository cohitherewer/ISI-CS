          RUDRA BISWAS                            Ekka and Rai                                  
	Ranchi, Dec. 11: Enforcement Directorate (ED) today filed charges under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act against former ministers Anosh Ekka and Harinarayan Rai, both of whom are fighting Assembly elections from jail.        
	Along with the charges, called complaints under the act, the ED also sought permission of the designated judge, B. Jha Parvir, to name their family members as co-accused.        
	In its complaints, the ED alleged that during the time they were ministers between April 2005 and December 2008, Ekkas unaccounted assets were worth Rs 6.67 crore and Rais Rs 1.63 crore  accumulated through siphoning of state funds.         
	The ED also submitted a list of 110 sale deeds of land and documents of eight cars bought by Ekka.         
	Further investigations are underway. Evidence with the directorate reveal that many of the plots and other properties in possession of the two former ministers have been bought by them in the name of their spouses, family members and other near and far relatives, the special public prosecutor, Ranchi, S.R. Das, told The Telegraph.        
	Das pointed out that the ED had sought permission of the court to name their family members and relatives as co-accused under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act and also under the Indian Penal Code.        
	The ED would now file supplementary complaints against them, many of whom had ignored its summons.        
	Both Ekka and Rai have been lodged at the Birsa Munda Central Jail here since August 17.         
	While Ekka is contesting from Simdega and Kolebira, which goes to polls tomorrow, Rai is fighting from Jarmundi, voting for which was over in the third phase.        
	The ED has filed FIRs against Ekka, Rai, former chief minister Madhu Koda and his close associates and other former ministers under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act.         
	The state Vigilance Bureau has also filed charges against them for possessing assets disproportionate to their known sources of income.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Ridiculous, we cant catch Kishanji: CM
                                                                                                           Ridiculous, we cant catch Kishanji: CM
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                            Bhattacharjee at the news conference. (PTI)                                  
	New Delhi, Oct. 24: A rattled but feisty Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee today admitted he felt ridiculous at the failure to catch Maoist leader Kishanji and publicly ticked off home secretary Ardhendu Sen for his comments on the cop-for-tribals swap.        
	If the Maoists learn this lesson (that they can get away by kidnapping the police), they are wrong. I will teach them a lesson in the future, the Bengal chief minister said, responding to insinuations that the government had capitulated and set a precedent.        
	On Thursday, the government had secured the release of police officer Atindranath Dutta in exchange for bail to 14 tribal women.        
	If you think it is surrender, I cannot satisfy you, he said at a news conference here.        
	Bhattacharjee was categorical that the bargain was exceptional and would not be the norm.        
	A source said the chief minister, who also holds the home portfolio, had spoken to Sen. The home secretary was quoted as having said that the government had learnt from the experiences of the release of (then Union home minister Mufti Mohammad Sayeeds daughter) Rubaiya Sayeed and of passengers of an Indian Airlines flight that was hijacked to Kandahar.         
	Sen was quoted as having described India as a soft state that could not take as tough a stand against hostage-takers as Israel does.        
	It is his (Sens) personal view; it is not our official view, the chief minister said. Besides, Israel is a separate country. He (Sen) should not have said that. This was an exceptional case.        
	Such public repudiation of a senior bureaucrat is unusual. In January 1987, then foreign secretary A.P. Venkateswaran learnt of his impending sack at a news conference by Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi. Venkateswaran resigned.        
	The chief minister had a long meeting with Union home minister P. Chidambaram, who is planning and coordinating a national offensive against the Maoists, on Friday. Asked if Chidambaram was concerned at the failure to arrest Kishanji who has been speaking to the media several times a day, Bhattacharjee said: Why, it is my responsibility, too.        
	In other words why, the chief minister was asked, were the authorities not able to track mobile phone signals and trace the Maoist leaders whereabouts.        
	Not only the Centre, it is my responsibility also, Bhattacharjee replied. Sometimes I also feel ridiculous (at failing to arrest Kishanji). I am hopeful (that he will be found and caught).        
	He rejected the insinuation that the government had kowtowed to the Maoists by negotiating Duttas release. I am not surrendering. It is not even a climbdown.         
	He said the women who were released had been arrested on minor charges.

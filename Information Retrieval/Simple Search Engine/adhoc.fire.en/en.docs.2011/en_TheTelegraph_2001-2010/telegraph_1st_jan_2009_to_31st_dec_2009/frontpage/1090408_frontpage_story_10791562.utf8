The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Booted in: agony of 1984
                                                                                                           Booted in: agony of 1984
          RASHEED KIDWAI                            TV footage shows journalist Jarnail Singh lobbing his shoe at P Chidambaram during the news conference in Delhi. (Reuters)                                   
	New Delhi, April 7: The question that the Congress has been trying to duck hit it in the face today when a journalist lobbed a shoe at home minister P. Chidambaram.        
	I protest, said Jarnail Singh, 34, standing up from his front row seat at a news conference, as he sent his white-and-blue trainer flying.        
	The missile missed the minister but hit its target: by late evening, Congress leaders admitted that the candidature of Jagdish Tytler, an accused in the 1984 anti-Sikh riots, was being reviewed.         
	But the leaders added it would not be easy to withdraw Tytlers nomination because then that of another riot accused, Sajjan Kumar, would also have to be cancelled. Besides, a section of the Congress is not convinced yet that the perceived cost of the backlash in Punjab and Delhi warrants overhauling the list approved by the partys poll committee.        
	Congress sources said tonight that if Tytlers ticket had to be withdrawn, it would not be possible without the intervention of Sonia Gandhi, Manmohan Singh or Rahul Gandhi. But the sources added that nothing could be ruled out.         
	Tytlers nomination from Northeast Delhi and Sajjan Kumars from South Delhi has upset victims of the 1984 riots, which saw over 4,000 Sikhs massacred within hours of Indira Gandhis assassination.         
	The CBIs clean chit to Tytler  the agency told a court it has no evidence against him  further angered the Sikh community. Protests have been held every day since the CBI submitted its report in March-end.        
	At the packed news conference in the Congress headquarters, Jarnail Singh today asked Chidambaram if the CBI had acted under pressure from the home ministry.        
	Neither the home ministry nor any other ministry put any pressure on the CBI. The CBI has only given a report. It is for the court to decide whether to accept the report or not, the minister replied.         
	The journalist persisted, and Chidambaram shot back: No arguments.        
	The shoe sailed past the stunned minister and landed to his right. His guards dragged Singh out and handed him to police.        
	I forgive him, the minister said, refusing to press charges. The Congress, too, tried to play down the incident, its discomfiture at the 1984 riots returning to centre-stage showing in its reluctance to hit out at the journalist.        
	Opposition parties, from the BJP to the Left to the Akali Dal, pointed to the outrage in the Sikh community over the ticket to a riot accused. The anti-Tytler camp in the Congress seized the opportunity to rush to Rahul, who had said in Amritsar riot-tainted leaders would not be fielded.        
	Although pressure mounted on Sonia and the Prime Minister to withdraw his candidature, Tytler said today: For me, the case is closed.        
	But the Congress wasnt saying that. Congress is a large party and it takes considered decisions.... Let us see what solutions emerge, spokesperson Ashwini Kumar said. The last date for filing nominations in Delhi is April 17.        
	In Calcutta, Mamata Banerjee wanted the case reopened. The CBI should not have given the clean chit to Tytler on the eve of the general election. It should restart the 1984 riots case, said the MP from South Calcutta, which like Asansol, Dum Dum and Barrackpore has a sizeable Sikh presence.         
	CPM state secretary Biman Bose dared Mamata to snap ties with the Congress if her concern was genuine.         
	Jarnail Singh said his method might have been wrong but his grievance was genuine. I just wanted to ask (Chidambaram) how he can be happy when one whole community is in deep anguish, he said. I just wanted to ask how justice can be done but he was not interested in answering the question. I do not think it is the right way but the issue is right, he said.         
	His employers, Dainik Jagran, however, said they would take disciplinary action.        
	Bush-throw sentence        
	In Baghdad, the original journalist shoe-thrower, 30-year-old Muntazer al-Zaidi, had his jail sentence for hurling shoes at former US President George W. Bush slashed to one year from three today. Bush was deeply unpopular in Iraq.

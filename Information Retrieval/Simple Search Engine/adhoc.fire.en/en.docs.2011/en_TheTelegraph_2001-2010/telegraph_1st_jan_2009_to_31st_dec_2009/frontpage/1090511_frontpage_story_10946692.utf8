The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Dhoni face, captain name 
                                                                                                           Dhoni face, captain name

	Mahendra Singh Dhoni may not know this but he is part of the election campaign in Chennai South. At least his pictures are.        
	G. Devadoss, who was denied a DMDK ticket, has printed smiling photos of the Team India and Chennai Super Kings captain to convey the message that he continues to have the captains support even though he is contesting as an Independent. The captain being alluded to is Dhoni, not actor and DMDK boss Vijayakanth.        
	Vote for the candidate who has the blessings of Captain, say the posters, which have evoked more than a passing interest because of the ongoing Indian Premier League. Vijayakanth is also fondly called Captain by many of his fans after he played a forest officer in Captain Prabhakaran.        
	For me, Vijayakanth is the original captain but since I cannot use his pictures, I am using Dhonis, who is my favourite cricketer, Devadoss said.         
	He argued that he had to resort to such an attention-grabbing method as the DMDK had given tickets to newcomers and not founding members like him, who had been fans of Vijayakanth for nearly two decades.        
	To complete the effect, Devadoss has printed a photo of a local cricket team below Dhonis close-up.         
	Its a smart move as he has sought to use the popularity of Dhoni and cricket while punning on the word captain, said popular TV comedian and club cricketer Bosskey.        
	But the DMDK candidate, V. Gopinath, is not amused. I have complained to the Election Commission that the word captain should not be used in the campaign posters of anyone but the official DMDK candidate.        
	The poll panel has chosen not to intervene, apparently because the use of the word captain or Dhonis picture doesnt violate rules.        
	Unchecked, Devadoss asserts that even Dhoni cant dissuade him from using the pictures. Having seen only photos of political leaders, people are happy to see a cricketing hero on my posters. It is having a Trinamuls asset amp; threatbetter impact than I expected. So even if Dhoni requests, I dont intend to remove his pictures, Devadoss said.        
	So, Dhoni will continue to bat for Devadoss till voting day on May 13.

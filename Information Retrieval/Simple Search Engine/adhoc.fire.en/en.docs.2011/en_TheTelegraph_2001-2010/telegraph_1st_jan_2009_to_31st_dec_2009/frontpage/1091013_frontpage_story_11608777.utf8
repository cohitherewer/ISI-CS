The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Dav to be Knight Riders coach 
                                                                                                           Dav to be Knight Riders coach 
          LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI                    Whatmore                          
	Oct. 12: Some two-and-a-half years ago, Dav Whatmore lost out on a chance to work with Sourav Ganguly. That was when the board ignored him for the Team India coachs job.         
	Destiny, though, has taken another turn.        
	According to sources, the 1996 World Cup-winning coach has resigned as the National Cricket Academy (NCA)s director of cricket operations and will now be coaching the Shah Rukh Khan-owned Kolkata Knight Riders.        
	The Colombo-born Australians three-year contract with the board, which runs the NCA, was to end in December 2010. Whatmores resignation has paved the way for his succeeding John Buchanan. He will, of course, serve the mandatory notice period as nobody wants to antagonise the board, a source said.        
	Another pointed out that Whatmores fine record in the subcontinent tilted the scales in his favour. Besides two stints with Sri Lanka, he has worked with Bangladesh and was the coach when it made the Super Eights (at Indias expense) in the last World Cup.        
	That Whatmore was on the Knights radar had been reported in these columns on July 17.        
	John Wright started off as the favourite to take Buchanans chair, but the New Zealander lost out on two grounds: (a) uncertainty over his availability and (b) not exactly being seen as one who could be given an extended (perhaps a three-year) contract.        
	Also, its possible that Shah Rukh wouldnt have liked the captain-designate, icon Sourav, to call all the shots in the Knights dressing room.        
	Not that Whatmore is going to be another Buchanan, but he certainly wouldnt be as amenable as Wright. Whatmore has worked with the Arjuna Ranatungas and, in his first innings, brought the best out of Lanka. Made them world-beaters, in fact.         
	After two poor seasons, 2010 is a make-or-break year for the Knights, which is why Shah Rukh and his core team took months to decide on Buchanans successor. The IPL is a very different platform, but they expect Whatmore to repeat 1996.        
	Wasim Akram will remain the general consultant.

	Ranchi, Dec. 14: Did they or didnt they? Reports of a chance meeting between JMM chief Shibu Soren and BJP general secretary Arun Jaitley at Ranchi airport yesterday has sent tongues wagging at a time the marathon electoral battle in the state has reached a crucial stage.        
	Political parties, vying for power, are desperate to avoid being caught on the wrong side of the divide. In this scenario, even a chance meeting assumes enough significance.        
	However, in this case, both parties have denied any parley. JMM leader Suraj Mandal, who was with Soren when the reported meeting took place, maintained that no discussion had taken place. We dont need anybodys support as we have already got the majority, he claimed. Former BJP chief M. Venkaiah Naidu, who was here to address election meetings, insisted Jaitley had not even met Soren.         
	Former Rajya Sabha member Ajay Maroo, who was accompanying Jaitley, said there was no eye contact between the two, let alone any talks on post-poll alliances.         
	Going one step further, BJP state president Raghubar Das said the aggressive voting pattern implied that the electorate had gone against the ruling dispensation. The BJP has already achieved majority. What we get in the fifth phase will be a bonus. So we dont need any post-poll alliance to form the government, he said.        
	But the Congress, expectedly, had a different take on the issue. Said partys state president Pradeep Balmuchu: The BJP-JD(U) alliance is claiming to have secured enough seats to form the government. Why then is it still talking to the JMM?        
	According to insiders, both BJP and Congress have kept options open for an alliance with the JMM should they fail to get a majority. But leaders are tight-lipped, as admitting the same would amount to conceding defeat even before the battle was over.        
	Without wishing to be identified, a senior BJP leader said the party was comfortable either way. If the party gets majority its fine. If not, we will take support of JMM, he confided.        
	JMM leaders also do not rule out the possibility of a BJP-JMM alliance if neither gets enough seats. If a post-poll alliance is needed for formation of government, it will be BJP-JMM only. The JMM will not go with Congress, said a former BJP MLA, who is contesting on a JMM ticket in Santhal Pargana.         
	Babulal Marandis JVM is also keeping its options open. If the Congress joins hands with JMM, JVM will support the government from outside. Soren and Marandi cannot sail in the same boat, pointed out a senior party leader.        
	All Jharkhand Students Union (Ajsu), which is confident of improving its 2005 tally of two is also holding its cards close. We will support a coalition that is able to provide a stable government. The decision will be taken only after the results are out, Ajsu president Sudesh Mahto told The Telegraph.                                 
	Of the 16 seats going to polls on December 18, the BJP has sitting MLAs in four, RJD in five, and one each is held by JD(U), Forward Bloc, CPI, NCP and two by Independents.        
	In this round, the real fight is between NDA and RJD. Of the 16 seats, 11 are in Palamau and Chatra that border Bihar. So Bihar leaders Nitish Kumar and Lalu Prasad have much at stake in the final phase.

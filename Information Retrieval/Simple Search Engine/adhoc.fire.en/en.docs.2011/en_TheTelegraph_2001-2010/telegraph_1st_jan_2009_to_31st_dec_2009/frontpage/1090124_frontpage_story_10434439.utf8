The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Court licence to smoke on screen

	New Delhi, Jan. 23: Advantage Shah Rukh Khan: that is the score now in the tussle between health minister Anbumani Ramadoss and the film fraternity over the depiction of smoking on screen.         
	Delhi High Court today struck down the Centres October 2006 ban on smoking in films.         
	Shah Rukh, a heavy smoker off screen, has got the artistic licence to puff away to glory in his movies.        
	A film must reflect the realities of life. Smoking is a reality of life. It may be undesirable but it exists. It is not banned by any law, Justice Sanjay Kishan Kaul said.         
	Directors of films should not have multifarious authorities breathing down their necks when indulging in creative acts, he added.         
	The government is likely to appeal the decision in the Supreme Court.         
	The creative rights of a filmmaker are part of his larger right to freedom of speech and expression guaranteed under the Constitution, the court ruled. Any form of censorship is an inroad on the freedom of expression apart from the fact that censorship is highly subjective and can be essentially mindless.        
	On July 27, 2007, the high court had reserved its order on filmmaker Mahesh Bhatts petition challenging the amendments to the Advertisement and Regulation of Trade and Commerce, Production and Supply Act, 2003, which banned scenes of smoking in films.         
	The amendment, which also banned smoking in public, permitted scenes of smoking only on a limited scale in documentaries.         
	Bhatt had argued that the ban amounted to violation of filmmakers fundamental rights. His lawyer said filmmakers also depicted the adverse effect of tobacco products by showing the failing health of those who smoked and drank. The government permits the production and distribution of cigarettes, he pointed out.         
	The government defended the act on the ground that the peoples right to health was more important than the rights of a filmmaker. The policy, it said, had been drafted to discourage smoking among the general public because it had a right to good health.         
	In his campaign against smoking, Ramadoss, who was largely instrumental for the ban, had even appealed to Shah Rukh and Amitabh Bachchan not to portray such scenes.        
	The court said: The undesirability of the act of smoking has nothing to do with the right of the director as an artiste to express what he desires.         
	Films, Justice Kaul said in his 50-page order, should not only show moral lectures.        
	To depict such an act (smoking) without glamorising it or promoting any particular product cannot be prohibited as it would bar a representation of how life is.

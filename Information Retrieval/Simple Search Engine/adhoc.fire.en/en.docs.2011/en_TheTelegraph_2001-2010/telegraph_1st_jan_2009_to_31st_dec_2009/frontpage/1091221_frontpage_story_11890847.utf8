The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Maoists hope for hung House
                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                Maoists hope for hung House
          NISHIT DHOLABHAI                            Over 25,000 paramilitary jawans still on duty in the state                                  
	New Delhi, Dec. 20: Elections in Jharkhand may have passed off peacefully thanks to the large presence of security forces, but a blitzkrieg against the Maoists does not appear to be on the cards any time soon.         
	Eager as it is to act against Maoists, the Centre will calibrate a response depending on the election results that will determine whether it will be a stable state government or a return to political volatility in the state.         
	So for now, it is wait and watch, home ministry sources said.         
	More than 20,000 paramilitary personnel have been deployed in Jharkhand for the elections, over and above the existing six battalions of the CRPF already in the state for counter-insurgency operations. With more than 25,000 men in active deployment and planning against Maoists tested successfully during the course of the elections, the security forces are on standby.         
	If any party comes with a mandate, there could be operations any day. But if there is a mixed verdict, then governance issues and political volatility may make things difficult, said a home ministry official.         
	If the Congress or BJP get a comfortable majority in the 81-seat Assembly, then it will be time for the Maoists to take defensive action. However, in case of a split verdict, the advantage will lie with Maoists who reportedly, would be happy with political uncertainty. For instance, if the JMM, with its group of legislators, including former Maoist leaders, takes part in government, then operations will depend on what Shibu Soren feels would be politically and practically, expedient.         
	Since August 17, when chief ministers or representatives from seven Naxalite-affected states met in Delhi with the home minister, there has been anxiety about anti-Naxalite operations.        
	Jharkhand, Chhattisgarh and Maharashtra are already co-ordinating operations against Maoists at the inter-state tri-junctions.         
	However, full-scale operation in the hinterland depends on situations in every state.         
	In this case, it is Jharkhands political situation that will play a role in North Blocks decision. The BJP is on the same page as the Congress on action against Maoists but if it is a mixed verdict, it could delay operations for a while in Jharkhand, said a senior police officer in central India.         
	More than 60,000 paramilitary troops are deployed across the seven states and more will be sent.                     
	The year has been a watershed in terms of Maoist violence. Minister of state for home affairs, Ajay Maken admitted this in Parliament last week.         
	The Left-wing extremism scenario in the country is characterised by growing spatial spread, increased intensity of violence, targeted attacks on police and alleged police informers, rapid militarisation and stepped-up efforts at mass mobilisation, he told the Rajya Sabha.         
	It is due to this reason that the UPA government is doubly anxious about and is attaching more importance to the final outcome of elections in Jharkhand.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | In queue: a plasma scientist and then a prime minister
                                                                                                           In queue: a plasma scientist and then a prime minister

	Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and his wife Gursharan Kaur stand in queue to vote at Sarumataria in Guwahati on Thursday.         
	The Singhs had to wait only a few minutes as the voting process was speeded up and entry restricted as soon as the Prime Minister reached the venue. Singh said it felt like a homecoming.         
	And the other voters?         
	Plasma scientist Bipul Kumar Saikia (in blue T-shirt), who stood in front of Singh, said: It was a great feeling and a wonderful experience. The Prime Minister smiled and greeted us all with a namaskar. It (voting with the PM) was a nice coincidence that I will never forget in my life.        
	 As India voted in the second phase, The Telegraph sought out voters who were pressing the button for the second general election after they voted in 2004 and asked them whether their faith in the system had gone up in the five years since          
	Nisha Tharani         
	Age: 24        
	Occupation: Student        
	Place: Bhopal        
	Constituency: Bhopal        
	Changes in politics since 2004: The Congress-led UPA has completely failed to offer stability. The Prime Minister has had little or no control over his cabinet colleagues and allies        
	Changes in my life since 2004: I was doing my graduation then. Worked for two years but left it as I was not satisfied either with its nature or the salary that I was getting. I am now studying again        
	My concern: I find it paradoxical that inflation is at an all-time low but when I go to buy vegetables or other essentials, prices are always going up        
	Why I vote: Political parties have no solution to my problems. But I will still go and vote and tell all youngsters to do so                
	Ashish Gupta         
	Age: 24        
	Occupation: Shopkeeper        
	Place: Ramban, 150km from Jammu        
	Constituency: Udhampur        
	Changes in politics since 2004: Ramban became a district in 2007, got colleges and created jobs for youths, a proof that politics is bringing about a change in the lives of people        
	Changes in my life since 2004: Was a student of Class XII then. Now I am assisting my shopkeeper father         
	My concern: I want a government job, but I realise it would be difficult because I have studied only till Class XII         
	Why I vote: Politics is improving the livelihood of people in my country and it is trickling down to my district                
	Dipmala Das         
	Age: 23        
	Occupation: Doctor        
	Place: Guwahati        
	Constituency: Guwahati        
	Changes in politics since 2004: Political parties are more busy campaigning against each other rather than highlighting real issues. Last time, the trend was somewhat different and parties were highlighting their own achievements        
	Changes in my life since 2004: Well, I have become a doctor!        
	My concern: Politics has become more communal now, at least in the state

	Changes in politics since 2004: More Independent candidates, showing individuals also want to shoulder responsibility of governance. Voters are more aware of rights and duties         
	Changes in my life since 2004: Last time my friends forced me to vote, but this election I did so willingly. Was jobless then but now I am working        
	Why I vote: I have started taking an interest in politics

	Place: Bangalore        
	Constituency: Bangalore South        
	Changes in politics since 2004: More young people are contesting. Parties are talking to the middle class. People in the city are also waking up        
	Changes in my life since 2004: Shifted jobs, got married                                      Reports by Rasheed Kidwai,   Muzaffar   Raina, Ajay Sukumaran, Daulat Rahman and Antara Bose

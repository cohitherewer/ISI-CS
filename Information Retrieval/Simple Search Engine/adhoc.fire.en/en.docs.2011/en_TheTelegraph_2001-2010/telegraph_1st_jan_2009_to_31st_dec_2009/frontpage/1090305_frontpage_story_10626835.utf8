	Ranchi, March 4: The income tax department today informed Jharkhand High Court that prima facie five former ministers of the state possessed assets disproportionate to their known sources of income, prompting the division bench to ask the state why the CBI shouldnt be called in to take over the investigations.  
	The bench comprising Chief Justice Gyan Sudha Misra and Justice D.K. Sinha directed the income tax department to prepare a detailed affidavit and serve a copy to the state for pursuing the matter. It also asked a question to the state: since it appeared that the former ministers  Bandhu Tirkey, Bhanu Pratap Sahi, Dulal Bhuiya, Kamlesh Singh and Chandra Prakash Choudhary  had acquired more assets than their income, why shouldnt the investigations be handed over to the CBI?        
	To round off its declaration, the counsel for the income tax department said it was now conducting extensive investigations into the properties that the ministers had acquired from their escaped income.        
	On February 26, the bench warned the income tax department not to shield politicians facing the assets probe by filing voluminous reports when all that the court wanted to know was whether there was a prima facie case against the five former ministers.         
	The court had set today as the next date of hearing.        
	On the status of the vigilance probe against former ministers Harinarayan Rai and Anosh Ekka, the special secretary in the Cabinet coordination department, D.K.Saxena, confirmed to the court today that the two also have assets disproportionate to their incomes.        
	Saxena said the vigilance department had sifted documents and papers which revealed several properties in the name of the former ministers, their spouses and their relatives. The benami properties, he said, had been bought in and around the capital and also in other big cities of the country.        
	In his affidavit, Saxena noted that the vigilance department had accessed bank accounts held by Rai, Ekka and their relatives and would be able to compile the quantum of assets and arrive at figures once the bank documents were analysed.        
	The court directed the IT department to pool resources and provide it to the state which would then take further action in the matter.

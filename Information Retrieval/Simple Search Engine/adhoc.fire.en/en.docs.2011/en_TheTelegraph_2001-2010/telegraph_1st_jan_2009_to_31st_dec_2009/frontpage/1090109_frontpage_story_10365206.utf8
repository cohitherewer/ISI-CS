The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Your Honour, countless lives are in your hands and under the govts feet
                                                                                                           Your Honour, countless lives are in your hands and under the govts feet
                                        
	The Bengal government is scheduled to approach Calcutta High Court today with an appeal for an extension of the expired deadline to enforce the ban on polluting two-stroke autos. The Telegraph recounts the condition of two victims of air pollution in Calcutta to underscore the heavy price people pay when the executive washes its hands of enforcing the law.              
	Lung cancer patient, on oxygen support at home. (Name withheld as the patient has not been told of the seriousness of his condition)        
	Profile: Non-smoker, in his mid-thirties. House on the outskirts of Calcutta. Works in the service sector. Came to Calcutta every day.                 
	Prognosis: Complained of fever and respiratory distress after October 2008. Initially treated by a local physician for tuberculosis and pneumonia. Later CT scan revealed a tumour in the right lung. Biopsy proved he was suffering from adenocarcinoma of lung (lung cancer) at a very advanced stage. Has undergone one cycle of chemotherapy.        
	Pronouncement: Adenocarcinoma of lung among non-smokers is closely linked to environmental pollution, said the respiratory physician who has been treating the patient.         
	This is emerging as the leading type of lung cancer in Calcutta with air pollution being the principal cause, the doctor added.         
	Lung cancer patient, on bed number 391 of Calcutta National Medical College and Hospital        
	Profile: Sukumar Debnath, 50. Non-smoker. Trader from Madhyamgram on the northern fringes of the city. Came to Calcutta every day for work.        
	Prognosis: Came down with fever and respiratory distress a few months back. CT scan revealed a tumour in the right lung. Biopsy proved lung cancer in an advanced stage.        
	Pronouncement: We might have to remove his entire right lung. But even then we arent sure whether he will survive, said Plaban Mukherjee, head of the cardio- thoracic department of the hospital. He was a non-smoker and was never exposed to industrial toxic fumes. Air pollution is responsible for his condition.   
	Not to forget  
	Emission from the banned two-stroke auto accounts for 32 per cent of air pollution in the city

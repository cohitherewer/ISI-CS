	Ranchi, April 17: A BSF team returning from poll duty was alert enough to clear four Maoist planted landmines, but one of the constables wasnt careful enough while trying to step aside from the fifth, resulting in his death.        
	Latehar faced the Maoists onslaught for the third consecutive day today. It happened around 10.30am when a group of five constables associated with the B company of the 20th BSF battalion spotted a fresh crack on the road at Oreya Ghati, 125km from Ranchi.        
	They apprehended a landmine and moved away immediately. But the plan was to check it out for sure before leaving the area. One of their colleagues, Lal Bahadur (20), a newly recruited constable, didnt realise he was stepping on it while crossing the road, leading to the mine being detonated, killing him on the spot.        
	The days only good news to come from Latehar was the rescue of four abducted poll officials of booth 118 after a night-long encounter between CRPF men and rebels, a kilometre away from Kumandi police station in Manika.        
	According to Latehar SP Hemant Toppo, those freed were presiding officer Mohammed Ismail, polling officers Anil Kumar and Sunder Kumar Singh and peon Saleem Ansari.         
	With todays death of the BSF constable, the number of central paramilitary forces personnel killed on election duty in Jharkhand touched nine. Three other constables in the BSF team, which was returning from Saryu village, were injured. They were M. Satyakumar, Karamchad Oraon and Kailash Baji Rao  all of them were airlifted to Ranchis Apollo Hospital.         
	Oraon was unable to hear in his right ear. He said they were on foot and had cleared four IEDs while walking 9km. Then, we noticed some fresh cracks on the road in Oreya valley, he said.        
	Fearing it was another IED, we decided to move away, but check it before leaving the area. Bahadur wasnt careful enough, triggering the mine, causing a huge explosion that killed him instantaneously,        
	Satyakumar was too traumatised to talk. He had lost hearing in both ears and suffered injuries in his leg and hand. Baji Rao was injured in the face, unable to see as well as hear anything.        
	BSF inspector-general Himmat Singh and state police chief V.D. Ram visited them in hospital.

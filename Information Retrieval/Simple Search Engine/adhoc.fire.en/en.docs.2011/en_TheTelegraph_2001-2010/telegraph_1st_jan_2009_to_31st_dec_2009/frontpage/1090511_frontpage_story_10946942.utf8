The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Cong, NCP on a tightrope
                                                                                                           Cong, NCP on a tightrope
  - Doors open for coalition with UDP        OUR CORRESPONDENT                                          
	Shillong, May 10: A disagreement over cabinet berths and induction of disqualified legislators may delay the formation of the Congress-Nationalist Congress Party coalition in Meghalaya, with the Congress even keeping its door open for the United Democratic Party if its proposed tie-up falls through.        
	A Congress legislator today admitted that there are differences over the partys suggestion that the four disqualified legislators who supported the Meghalaya United Alliance and another UDP legislator Ampareen Lyngdoh, who had resigned as an MLA, should be accommodated in the proposed ministry.         
	Though initially the Congress had agreed to give five cabinet berths to the NCP, including the post of deputy chief minister to Conrad Sangma, son of P.A. Sangma, the party has now agreed to allot only three ministerial berths to the NCP.        
	The move came after Congress legislators opposed the decision to grant five berths to the NCP.        
	Moreover, Congress leader D.D. Lapang wants to accommodate at least Paul Lyngdoh and former UDP MLA Ampareen Lyngdoh, who joined the Congress recently, if not the other three disqualified legislators.         
	The Congress now suggests that of the five seats earlier promised to the NCP, two should be left to Paul and Ampareen as they had supported the Congress-led Meghalaya United Alliance in the time of crisis.         
	There is no objection from the NCP camp to Lapang becoming the chief minister of the new Congress-NCP combine, as the Congress is the single largest party with 26 members.         
	An NCP source said though berth sharing was discussed at length by the two parties in Delhi during the past week, the Congress has refused the grant five seats to the NCP.        
	Several more rounds of talks between the Congress and the NCP leaders in Delhi are likely to be held.         
	If the NCP is not happy with the outcome of the meetings in Delhi, the party may wait till May 16, which is a counting day for the Lok Sabha elections, to decide its future course of action, the source said.         
	NCP leaders P.A. Sangma and his son Conrad, during the recent meeting with the AICC leaders in Delhi, had objected to the plan of the Congress to induct the disqualified legislators in the proposed ministry.         
	However, the contention of the Congress leaders was that the disqualified legislators can be ministers for six months and can continue once they get elected to the Assembly after the byelections.         
	As the Supreme Court will hear the petition regarding the four disqualified legislators tomorrow, the Congress leaders will also wait for the outcome of the verdict before forming the government.         
	Lapang, however, said the proposed government formation has nothing to do with the Supreme Courts verdict regarding the legislators. He will leave for Shillong tomorrow.         
	A senior Congress leader in Shillong, on the other hand, said if the proposed alliance does not materialise, it will align with the UDP to form a stable government.         
	UDP legislature party leader J.D. Rymbai has already made it clear that the party was open to an alliance with the Congress if the talks with the NCP in Delhi fail.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Poll ambitions on Games platter
                                                                                                           Poll ambitions on Games platter
          SUMAN K. SHRIVASTAVA                                    
	Ranchi, Sept. 15: While the BJP is crying itself hoarse demanding immediate elections in the state, the Congress is quietly working towards showcasing the forthcoming National Games in Jharkhand as its election launch pad.        
	Though party leaders in the state deny any such move, efforts are on by state as well as central leaders to use the occasion to woo the youth with the All India Youth Congress beginning a month-long membership drive to enrol new members between 18-35 years from September 19.        
	The Games, originally scheduled for 2007 and deferred four times, will now be held from November 21 to December 5. More than 8,000 players and sports officials are expected to participate in various sporting disciplines to be held in Ranchi, Jamshedpur and Dhanbad.        
	The National Games Organising Committee (NGOC) has invited Sonia Gandhi to inaugurate the event and Prime Minister Manmohan Singh is supposed to be present at the concluding ceremony on November 5.        
	Rahul Gandhi will be camping here for three days, probably sometime next month, to motivate the youth to join the Congress, said Manoj Chauhan, the Jharkhand in-charge for the enrolment drive.        
	NGOC working president R.K. Anand took pains to clarify that the Games should not be linked with the Congress. It is not Congress Games, he said and maintained it wasnt unusual for Sonia to open it as she had also inaugurated the 33rd National Games held in Guwahati 2007.        
	Also, he said the BJPs demand to defer the Games till elections were held was unfortunate. Successive BJP chief ministers like Babulal Marandi and Arjun Munda were also on the board of the NGOC. In fact, the party had also included the Games in its election manifesto, he added.        
	The Congress is looking at a December-January poll schedule in the state. Indian Olympic Association chairman Suresh Kalmadi has already requested the Election Commission to schedule Assembly polls in Jharkhand after the Games.        
	The only worry is the model code of conduct that comes into force from the date of announcement of elections. Therefore, if elections are indeed announced before the Games, partymen fear the Centre will not be able to announce any new welfare schemes or programmes for Jharkhand.        
	So, we expect elections to be declared soon after the Games are over, hoped a senior Congress leader. State Congress chief Pradeep Balmuchu agreed that elections would be held only after the National Games.        
	Out of 34 Games events, 24 are to be held in Ranchi where a mega sports complex has been built in Hotwar with a seating capacity of 35,000.         
	This apart, a new hockey stadium with astro-truf is also ready, while the Birsa Stadium has been renovated to house 40,000 guests. Of the remaining events, six are to be held in Dhanbad and four in Jamshedpur. While a squash court has been built in Dhanbad, Jamshedpur will host archery, boxing, weightlifting and womens football at existing facilities.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Crowds pick final favourite 
                                                                                                           Crowds pick final favourite 
  - Team with home icons a hit after Bollywood flops          PRATIM D. GUPTA                                    
	Johannesburg, May 23: When Royal Challengers Bangalore was playing the Chennai Super Kings in a league match and Jacques Kallis got out, his sister Janine was spotted dancing away on the boundary ropes!        
	Why? She was wearing the yellow colours of M.S. Dhonis team as one of its cheerleaders.        
	While Janine was just doing her job, IPL fans in South Africa have been quite upfront about which team they want to support.         
	After 35 days and 58 matches, they know which colours they want to wear and which flags they want to float.        
	Its not been about just cheering fours, sixes and free hits, but rooting for a team they want to win. Sometimes for one player, sometimes for the star owner, sometimes to just be patriotic.        
	Tomorrow at the Bullring, the Deccan Chargers, who have made it to the final from eighth place on the table last year, will surely be the visiting team. And that despite Herschelle Gibbs being an integral part of the side. He may be cheered in Cape Town but not at the Wanderers.        
	On the same South African ground in the World Cup 2003 final, Adam Gilchrist had found himself playing against crowd favourites India. On Sunday evening, the former Australian wicket-keeper may again find himself playing for the other team.        
	In the last few days, Bangalore has emerged as the crowd favourites. Nah, they dont drink Kingfisher here  Castle Lager is very much the national beer  nor are they smitten by brand ambassador Katrina Kaif, but Jacques Kallis, Mark Boucher, Dale Steyn and Roelof van der Merwe have swung things in favour of Mallyas men.        
	Kallis and Boucher have stirred up Protean passion with their match-winning knocks while van der Merwe scalped big-hitting danger man Dhoni in the march to the final.        
	Kallis and Boucher have always been the most popular cricketers in the national cricket side and they have lots of fans throughout the country, said 25-year-old South African Gareth Evans, who is another Royal Challengers convert.        
	Also, they were always assured to be part of the starting eleven unlike some of our other cricketers like (Charl) Langeveldt and Makhaya (Ntini).         
	Supporting the home boys or the sporting icon has not been the only criterion for getting behind the IPL teams. In the (really) early part of the tournament, a lot of people wanted to support Shah Rukh Khans team.         
	They wouldnt know why a man from Mumbai had a team from Calcutta, but they loved the Bollywood connection.        
	Oh, Shah Rook Kans team was such a waste that we stopped watching their matches, grumbled Durban taxi driver Justice.        
	We then supported Pretty Zeeenta as she came and spoke about her team on the Lotus FM radio station. They have also been showing their movies on the SABC channel on TV.        
	But unfortunately for Justice and his ilk, all the Bollywood teams have been eliminated and going into Sunday, they have to pick a team that prides itself on its cricket.        
	Lalit Modis annual release has been declared a blockbuster again but to see whether there will be smiling faces in the crowd at the climax, we have to wait till tomorrow.

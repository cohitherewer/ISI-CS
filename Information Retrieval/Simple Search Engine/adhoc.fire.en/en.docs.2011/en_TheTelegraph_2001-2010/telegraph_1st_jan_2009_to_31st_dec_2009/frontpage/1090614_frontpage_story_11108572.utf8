	Ahmedabad, June 13: A Surat mob handed out instant justice to the three youths accused of raping a schoolgirl in a moving car yesterday, thrashing them at a hospital after a medical examination.        
	A large crowd, including relatives of the victim and members of womens groups, had gathered at the city civil hospital after news leaked that the accused had been brought there.        
	The trio, two of them sons of policemen, were easily identifiable because, ironically, they had covered their faces. They were snatched from an outnumbered police team, punched, then thrown to the ground and kicked while their escorts called for reinforcements.        
	After 20 minutes of chaos, the police rescued Sahid Sayyed, Tariq Sayyed and Abu Bakar Shaikh.        
	Luckily, none of them got badly injured, Surat police commissioner Deepak Swaroop said, hours before he was transferred for certain earlier comments on the alleged gang-rape.        
	A PTI report, quoting unnamed police sources, however, said one of the accused was badly injured but did not identify him.        
	According to home department officials, Swaroop had said the accused had caught the 17-year-old victim, a Class XI student, in a compromising position with a male classmate and taken advantage of it.        
	Minister of state for home Amit Shah contradicted this and said: The home department has transferred Deepak Swaroop from Surat. He is being replaced by Shivanand Jha, Surat Range IG (inspector-general).        
	The girl was going to her coaching classes with the boy around 5.30am when the accused, posing as policemen, forced them into their car and gang-raped her.        
	Sahid is the son of the circle police inspector of Dholka town, Ahmedabad district, while Tariqs father is a police constable in Surat.        
	The accused have been remanded in 14 days police custody. The police have sought permission to carry out narco-analysis tests on them.        
	Womens groups staged protests across Surat against the alleged rape, and several outfits including the Vishwa Hindu Parishad called a bandh on Monday.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | A tear for Emergency lion in winter 
                                                                                                           A tear for Emergency lion in winter 
  - Muzaffarpur cannot figure out why its hero Fernandes is fighting this election         SANKARSHAN THAKUR IN MUZAFFARPUR                        Fernandes in Muzaffarpur				                                       
	He won a thunderous victory here 32 years ago from behind the bars of Indira Gandhis jailhouse. He is whimpering to a sad end today behind the doors of his air-conditioned labyrinth. George Fernandes, gloried rebel of yore, lies chained in superannuated vainglory at the altar of his finest hour and nobodys even noticing.         
	In 1977, he emblazoned Muzaffarpur on the national map with a searing slap to the Emergency. His posters  a manacled George, famed forelocks gnashing at the iron fencing  won him the seat, he didnt even need to be here.         
	Today, nobody knows his address and everybodys saying he neednt be here. Poor man, cant even speak or stand, says the doorman at the Meenakshi International Hotel, risen bang opposite Muzaffarpur railway station, scene of many a rousing reception to George, Pata nahin kya soojha. (Dont know what made him do this.)         
	The first floor lobby is abustle  the balustrades leading up heaped with marigolds, the stairs a scurry of people running up and down, the reception area itself rippling with excitement. Cant get a word in at the front desk, cant find a seat to rest the exhaustions of the long and shoddy road from Bettiah.         
	But none of that is about George Fernandes. Its the onset of lagan  the wedding season  and the palaver is over brides and grooms and their respective parties; one sets vacating, their tidings done, anothers waiting to move in.        
	Jaarje? Jaarje kaun? asks the man across the reception when the enquiry about George finally gets through, Kaun barat party mein hain sir? (Which wedding party is he from, sir?)         
	Youd want to laugh at the unwitting wit of the liveried desk clerk, still diligently poring over his guest register. Hes wrong; George is a hotel guest, though probably not registered as occupant of Suite 105. But hes also right; Jaarje doesnt ring an instant bell here anymore. Forget which barat party, just ask George which party and he wont have an answer.         
	The Janata Dal (United), of which he was founder president (and is he still Patron?), said no to his last wish, politely, then firmly  youre too ill to contest the Lok Sabha, Georgesaheb, well give you an easy entry into the Rajya Sabha, the first seat available.         
	Just being considerate, the JD(U) argues; just being cruel, Georges shrunken circle of backers complain. This man single-handedly birthed this party, says Shambhu Shrivastav, one-time JD(U) spokesperson and currently manager of Georges campaign. How can you deny such a tall leader his last wish? This is a black conspiracy. He is a little ill, but who does not fall ill once in a while?         
	Nonsense, reckons current JD(U) spokesperson and Nitish Kumar loyalist Shivanand Tiwary. Georgesaheb is very very sick, some say it is Alzheimers. He cannot comprehend, he cannot speak, he does not know what is going on. There is merely a coterie trying to milk whatever they can from his name, it is shameless and callous what they are putting him through.         
	By many accounts, the report on Georges health is dire. When George arrived in Patna for his nomination a couple of weeks ago, it was apparent to all he wasnt himself. Carried into a waiting car, he tapped his drivers shoulder and mumbled something about why there was such commotion around. The driver told him it was his reception committee; George looked on blankly.         
	He cant recognise people anymore, said a senior bureaucrat who was a close aide during Georges days as defence minister. He just looked at me and turned, even though I repeatedly told him my name, he does not have his senses anymore.         
	Is George being hustled into this contest unknown to himself? Shrivastav is irate hes even been asked that. What do you mean? He is not a child, he is one of our greatest politicians, he has a mind of his own. Sure he has a speaking problem, but he is fit for this and absolutely ahead in the race. Muzaffarpur mein Georgesaheb nahin jeetenge to kaun jeetega? (If George wont win in Muzaffarpur, who will?)         
	In the same breath, though, Shrivastav complains about the desperate measures Nitish and the JD(U) are taking to somehow see George defeated. They have given the ticket to (Jainarain) Nishad and put up a dummy as Independent only to cut votes away. They want to ensure the victory of the LJP candidate just in order to slight Georgesaheb in his last battle.         
	To the LJP candidate  retired college teacher Bhagwan Sahni who lost to George by a mere 9,000 votes the last time  George is the key votekatua (vote-cutter) of this election, not the others. Hell get enough in the name of sentiment and sympathy, Sahnis campaign managers tell you happily, enough to ensure our victory.         
	But Shrivastav lumbers on in great earnest, marshalling his forces from a sofa in the frontroom of Suite 105. George himself is behind the closed bedroom door, resting. Its hot, Shrivastav says, even I could do with some rest, Georgesaheb to Georgesaheb hain. Hes just finished a roadshow. The next days itinerary is getting listed on his notepad  Bochahan, Musafirpur, Sultannagar, Sarai, Bochahan Bazar.         
	Shrivastav is also at two cellphones consistently, trying his best to goad the old George network into life. No ones turning up to help, or only a few are; there was a time George was trailed by a sea wherever he went in this vast and mostly rural north Bihar constituency; today a trickle has to be coaxed.                   
	Forget the netas, theyre all opportunists, Shrivastav grumbles at the end of another vain telephone conversation. It is the people who count and Georgesaheb still has a place in their hearts, they are the ones who have always seen him through. And that was evident on the roadshow.         
	What they call Georges roadshow is made up of a motley handful of cars mounted with his allotted symbol  a basket. George sits at the back of the lead car  windows rolled down so people can see him, one of his aides pertinently adds  and looks out at the world passing by. He cannot speak because of that accident he had, the aide explains, as if to say that shouldnt matter. But he can see and people can see him.         
	One of their objectives, surely, will be to ensure the people dont see too much of George; the more they get a sense of Georges failing health and comprehension, the more theyll be deterred from voting him.        
	Premji Lal, who was among the frenzied Muzaffarpur youth that built up the storm for George in 1977, believes the message has already spread and sunk. Everybody knows he is not physically able now, why is he calling this miserable end upon himself? There is a time and place for everything.         
	Premji is now with the LJPs Sahni, but part of him cant help shedding a wasted tear over the denouement his one-time hero is headed to. Dukhad, dukhad. (Its painful). And probably as poignant at the symbol George carries around  not many disagree his campaign is a basket case.              
	 Muzaffarpur votes on April 23

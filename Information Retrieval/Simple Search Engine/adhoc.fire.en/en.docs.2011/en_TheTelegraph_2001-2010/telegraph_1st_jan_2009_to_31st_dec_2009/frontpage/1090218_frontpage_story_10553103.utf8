          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                            LK Advani (right) and Pranab Mukherjee at the unveiling of the statue of social reformer Chhatrapati Shahu Ji Maharaj at Parliament on Tuesday. (PTI)                                  
	New Delhi, Feb. 17: Mark Antony came to bury Caesar, not to praise him  and did exactly the opposite.        
	Lal Krishna Advani came to bury the UPA, not to praise Pranab Mukherjee  and did exactly the opposite, too.        
	Indian Parliament witnessed today theatre akin to the Shakespearean Julius Caesar when Advani showered fulsome praise on Pranab, the stand-in finance minister who wears many a hat in the UPA government.        
	Eyes fixed on Mukherjee, Advani said in the Lok Sabha: Sometimes I think had Pranabji not been there, what could happen to this government? Whenever there is a crisis, he is there. Twenty-five years ago, he presented the budget and did so again yesterday as it was a crisis situation.        
	The BJP leader and Prime Minister-in-waiting was opening the debate in the Lok Sabha on the motion of thanks to the Presidents address.        
	The leader of the House, Mukherjee, is one year senior to me in Parliament. I was first elected to the Rajya Sabha in 1970 while he was elected one year before. Ever since I was introduced to Mukherjee, I have always appreciated his ability, his strength and his capability to shoulder responsibilities, Advani added.        
	If the panegyric grated on the ears of Mukherjee, he did not betray the discomfiture. Instead, the 73-year-old veteran responded with the grace only years of experience can command: he blushed a little, suppressed a smile, bowed and then folded his hands in a namaste.        
	The House greeted the performers with the adulation fit for thespians, thumping desks.        
	However, once the curtains came down, the inevitable Act II unfolded outside the House.        
	A Congress office-bearer close to the external affairs minister said: The praise is Advanis backhanded way of undermining the Prime Minister, which is rather nasty considering that Manmohan Singh is recuperating from a surgery.        
	The Congress leader recalled that Advani rarely passed up an opportunity to throw barbs at Singh, calling him the weakest PM.         
	Sources claiming to know Mukherjee well said he would have understood the context in which Advanis remarks were made. The context is mischievous. When the BJP was in power, we never alluded to the Advani-Vajpayee rivalry. If Advani imagines he can construct the same rivalry between the Prime Minister and Mukherjee with his speech, hes mistaken, a source said.        
	The sources said they believed that Mukherjee was keen to underplay his temporary assignment as finance minister.        
	The minister told some journalists that Mondays interim step was a vote-on-account a government routinely used during a budget session to undertake expenses before the Finance Bill was passed.        
	Asked how it felt to unwrap a budget after 25 years, Mukherjee stared hard at the papers on his table and reflected for a while before politely waving the journalists goodbye.        
	In the House, Mukherjee merited mention in the speech of the CPMs Mohammad Salim, too. For the last few years, the countrys economy has been in a mess. And you have been brought in to clean the mess, Salim told Mukherjee.         
	Mukherjee was as unlikely to have been taken in by this remark as that of Advani. The Lefts advocacy of Mukherjee for President in 2007 was said to have cost him the nomination.        
	As the ides of March (or April-May, depending on when the general elections are held) approaches, Indias politicians can be counted upon to brush up on their Shakespeare to master the art of making people look dishonourable by calling them honourable  as Antony did to Brutus.

	Dhaka, Feb. 27: Bodies of dozens of army officers have been found in shallow mass graves inside the BDR complex.        
	Till late this evening, the body count stood at 66, including that of Major General Shakil Ahmed, the chief of Bangladesh Rifles.        
	Sources said most of the dead were army commanders and at least four were civilians. Scores of people are reported missing.        
	We are digging out dozens of decomposing bodies dumped into mass graves, an officer said.        
	Many of the bodies were found in shallow holes that had been hastily covered with mounds of dirt. Others had been thrown into sewers.        
	In one grave, 43 bodies were found. Bodies have been stuffed into manholes, thrown into ponds and tanks, while those alive were hiding even in dirty sewer drains, a relative of a victim said,        
	Lt Col Syed Kamruzzaman said he saw Ahmed and several other officers being grabbed from a meeting, lined up and shot by another group on Wednesday.         
	Brigadier General Mainul Hossain has been appointed director-general of BDR in place of Ahmed.        
	Security forces have arrested nearly 300 BDR rebels who fled the headquarters after laying down arms. Disguised in civilian clothes, the mutineers were caught from buses and ferries near Dhaka.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Khunti rebel zone feels the heat
                                                                                                           Khunti rebel zone feels the heat
          AMIT GUPTA                              
	Ranchi, Oct. 28: Buoyed by its recent success, Central and state security forces have intensified operations in Maoist pockets of Ranchi and Khunti districts, laying the groundwork for Operation Green Hunt, the code name of the proposed offensive against rebels.        
	The offensive against Left-wing extremism has been intensified in Ranchi and Khunti districts. The operation will be launched in other districts too, deputy inspector-general of police R.K. Mallick told The Telegraph today.         
	Over the week, there has been a marked increase in police-Naxalite encounters in the chosen area, around 25km from the state capital.         
	The state police, along with the Central forces, tasted success in the forests of Angara where they foiled an attempt by around 30 Maoists to sneak into neighbouring Bengal.        
	The body of a rebel in police uniform was recovered, and the police claimed at least three others had died in the raid.        
	Sources said the police and the CRPF, who also defused a bomb on the spot, had planned the Angara operation meticulously. Three Naxalite sympathisers were also arrested.        
	Today, Khunti SP Aseem Vikrant Minj admitted that the ongoing operation had been intensified in the district which has three major rebel pockets  Rania-Torpa, Arki-Khunti and Karra regions where CPI(Maoist) and another breakaway faction, Peoples Liberation Front of India (PLFI), have been active for quite some time.         
	In fact, special branch inspector Francis Indwar was abducted from a Hembrom market in the Arki police station area.        
	We have been conducting regular operations in the region. But of late, the operation has been intensified with the presence of more central para-military forces in the district, said Minj.         
	State home secretary J.B. Tubid confirmed that operations had indeed been intensified, but would not comment on whether it was part of the major offensive planned by the Centre.         
	The morale of the security forces are at an all time high. But, we want to keep some things internal, he added.        
	As promised by the Centre, six battalions of central paramilitary forces have already arrived in Jharkhand, which means there are 5,000 additional troops available for any planned offensive.        
	Mallick said that in months to come the state would see an extended security blanket with development activity happening side by side in areas where rebels had entrenched themselves.        
	The operation across Maoist-dominated regions, he added, was aimed at gradually capturing the areas and then launching development projects centred around building roads, bridges and providing electricity in villages.         
	Hence, if it was felt that the five-phased Assembly polls through November and December would delay the anti-Maoist operations in Jharkhand, the signals emanating from the ground tell a different story.

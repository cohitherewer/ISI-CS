The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | UK has a woman poet laureate after 341 years
                                                                                                           UK has a woman poet laureate after 341 years
          SARAH LYALL                            Carol Ann Duffy in Manchester. (AFP)                                  
	London, May 2: The writer Carol Ann Duffy was appointed Britains poet laureate yesterday, becoming the first woman to take a 341-year-old job that has been held by, among others, Dryden, Tennyson, Wordsworth, Cecil Day-Lewis and Ted Hughes.         
	Duffy, 53, is known for using a deceptively simple style to produce accessible, often mischievous poems dealing with the darkest turmoil and the lightest minutiae of everyday life.         
	In her most popular collection, The Worlds Wife (1999), overlooked women in history and mythology get the chance to tell their side of the story, so that one poem imagines, for instance, the relief that Mrs Rip Van Winkle must have felt when her husband fell asleep, finally giving her some time for herself.         
	Announcing the decision, the culture secretary, Andy Burnham, called Duffy a towering figure in English literature today and a superb poet who has achieved something that only the true greats of literature manage  to be regarded as both popular and profound.         
	Duffy told the BBC radio programme Womans Hour that she had thought hard about accepting the post and that the decision to take it came purely because they hadnt had a woman.         
	She added: I look on it as recognition of the great women poets we now have writing, and said that she hoped to use the job to contribute to peoples understanding of what poetry can do.        
	Duffy, who has also written plays, and poems and stories for children, has a daughter, Ella. She had a relationship for some time with the Scottish poet Jackie Kay. In an interview with the writer Jeanette Winterson several years ago, Duffy said she had no interest in being known as a lesbian poet, whatever that is. She added: If I am a lesbian icon and a role model, thats great, but if its a word that is used to reduce me, then you have to ask why someone would want to reduce me. She said she preferred to define herself as a poet and a mother  thats all.        
	It remains to be seen what Duffy will make of the laureateship, which is something of a work in progress, despite being so ancient.         
	Back in the days of Dryden, the first writer to take the job officially, poets laureate were glorified courtiers, writing flattering odes to royal occasions both significant (coronations, deaths) and banal (returns home from journeys abroad).         
	This pressure to commemorate every little thing produced classics like the poem attributed to the Edwardian laureate Alfred Austin, upon the occasion of the Prince of Waless getting sick.         
	But Andrew Motion, Duffys predecessor, used the laureateship to bring poetry into schools and elsewhere, and to serve as its most visible national cheerleader  a town crier, can-opener and flag-waver to poetry, as he put it.

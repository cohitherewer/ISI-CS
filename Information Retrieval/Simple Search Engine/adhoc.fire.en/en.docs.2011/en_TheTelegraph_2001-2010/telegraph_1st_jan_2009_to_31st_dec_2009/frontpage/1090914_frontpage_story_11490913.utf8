          AMIT GUPTA                              
	Ranchi, Sept. 13: Blame it on Maoists. Several highway bridges in the state are on the verge of collapse and yet renovation continues to be a distant dream.         
	The national highway (NH) wing of the road construction department is well aware of at least 10 tottering bridges, but isnt doing anything concrete. The reason is anybodys guess  either wary contractors are not showing interest or tenders for repair are being plagued by Naxalism.        
	There are three-four bridges on Ranchi-Gumla road that need immediate replacement, but we are not getting quality contractors to start the project on time. Work is on in some other projects, but the progress is not at all satisfactory probably because of rebel activities and land hurdles, admitted Murari Bhagat, the chief engineer (NH division) of the road construction department.        
	The Nagfeni bridge on Ranchi-Gumla road was submerged following heavy downpour last week and this resulted in the traffic link to Chhattisgarh being snapped for more than 24 hours.        
	Though the bridge, constructed during the British rule, is being replaced by a parallel one, the project has not been able to pick up pace, thanks to heavy influence of Maoists in the area.        
	Muhane bridge on Hazaribagh-Chatra road  now being used as detour after the collapse of Siwane bridge at Nagwa in Hazaribagh  was constructed in 1925. Despite the executive engineer concerned issuing notice not to use the Muhane bridge, many heavy vehicles are still taking the route.        
	Condition of three other bridges in the Tabo valley area of Ranchi-Chaibasa road (NH-75E) is also pathetic. The Ranchi NH division is waiting for a sanction from the Centre so that the projects could be undertaken in either 2009-10 or 2010-11 fiscal.        
	Bhagat admitted that funds were not a problem for bridge and road revamp projects, but several other factors, particularly Naxalism, were delaying finalising of tenders. Dearth of quality contractors to execute projects in the region was also a problem.        
	With a major portion of the Ranchi-Hazaribagh stretch of NH-33 being declared unsafe because of an underground fire near Kujju, pressure is building on NH-99 that touches Chatra. Though the road won the national highway tag in 2000, its condition has not changed much. It looks more like a state highway or perhaps even less.        
	The NH-99 is not fit for heavy vehicles weighing beyond three tonnes, but after the Kujju fire and Siwane bridge collapse on NH-33, vehicles carrying more than 10 tonnes of load are using the stretch.        
	On NH-33 (Ranchi-Jamshedpur) between Ranchi and Taimara valley, the condition of Raisa bridge is also precarious. Recently, Rs 1.2 crore has been sanctioned for a new parallel bridge. Ranchi NH division executive engineer Rajesh Kumar Gupta said work order had been awarded.        
	Interestingly, the road construction department has not carried out any survey in the recent past to assess the condition of bridges and has also never bothered to mention their capacity.        
	Meanwhile, the Ranchi NH division has obtained a green signal from the office of road construction engineer-in-chief Vijay Kumar to invite short-term tender notice for a new alignment in Kujju. We will give less than a fortnight to interested contractors to bid for the project, said Gupta. We want to process the tender fast. Then we will see which agency  CCL, ministry of surface transport  funds the project, he added.

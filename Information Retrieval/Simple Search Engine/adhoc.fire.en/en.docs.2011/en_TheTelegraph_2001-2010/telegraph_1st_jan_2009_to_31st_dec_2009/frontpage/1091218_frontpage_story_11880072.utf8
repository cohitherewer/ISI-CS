	Ranchi/Hazaribagh, Dec. 17: Maoists made their ominous presence felt hours before the state witnessed the final phase of polling by killing a villager in Angadda, a remote area in Simaria constituency, and abducting the Nawjavan Sangharsh Morcha candidate from Garhwa, Rajesh Kumar.        
	Sushil Oraon was dragged out from his home late last night and killed. A Maoist poster recovered from near his body claimed that he had been punished for being an informer of the Jharkhand Prastuti Committee (JPC), a rival faction of the CPI(Maoist). Simaria goes to polls tomorrow.        
	In Garhwa, Kumar was abducted by suspected Maoists from Siroikala village under Ranka police station area.        
	The incident took place at the same spot where Maoists targeted a convoy of RJD candidate and sitting MLA, Girinath Singh, yesterday.         
	Eight suspected Maoists abducted Kumar at gunpoint at 11am.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Russia MiG jitters for India
                                                                                                           Russia MiG jitters for India
  - Moscow grounds model that makes up three IAF squadrons                              A MiG-29 fighter: Structural trouble                                  
	Moscow, March 13 (PTI): The Russian Air Force has grounded almost 30 per cent of its MiG-29 fleet because of structural defects, a move that could have ramifications for the Indian Air Force that has a sizeable number of these fighters.        
	About 90 aircraft out of 200 tested after the crash of the MiG-29 fighter last December have been grounded, Interfax reported, quoting a Russian Air Force spokesperson, Col Vladimir Dirk.        
	More aircraft could be grounded on completion of the air crash probe which followed two crashes last year.        
	The Russian Air Force has a fleet of about 300 MiG-29 fighters that make up its prime air superiority platform.        
	The IAF has 54 MiG-29 planes, comprising three squadrons. All the aircraft are being upgraded with the help of original manufacturers and some other countries to extend their life by 15-20 years.        
	Under the Gorshkov contract, India is acquiring 16 MiG-29K, the carrier-borne version of the air force fighters, for the navy.        
	Russia has also fielded the MiG-35 in the Indian tender for the acquisition of 126 MMRCA, which is a futuristic derivative of the MiG-29 fighter.        
	The probe was ordered after a MiG-29 crashed in December in the Khabarovsk region during a training sortie, killing its pilot. One of the fighters fins disintegrated in flight.        
	Initial reports have identified corrosion as the cause of the disintegration. It could take another two months to pinpoint the reason, Interfax said.        
	At this juncture, out of the whole fleet, 200 aircraft have been checked and about 100-plus fighters have been cleared for flights. Rest of the aircraft are being checked, Dirk said.        
	He said initially the entire fleet was grounded, but 100 aircraft were later cleared for flying after checks.        
	Experts, he said, had evolved methods to fix the defects. The grounded fighters would return to service once funds were available for repairs.        
	The twin-engine MiG-29, codenamed Fulkrum by Nato, has been in service with the Soviet and then the Russian Air Force since the 1980s.         
	Last year, Algeria, one of Russias closest Cold War era allies, had returned 15 MiG-29, saying the quality was poor.

          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Bhubaneswar, June 25: In the backdrop of a sudden spurt in Maoist attacks in Orissas Koraput, Union home minister P. Chidambaram today reviewed the situation in the district and visited some security establishments in the rebel-hit area.        
	The home minister landed at the OSAP field in Koraput at 5.10pm. Beginning his two-day tour of the state, he then proceeded to visit the counter-insurgency training camp and the district armoury in the southern town in the evening.        
	The minister interacted with the personnel there and tried to ascertain whether the armoury, which was looted by Maoists in February 2006, had been properly fortified to prevent recurrence of any such attack, sources said.        
	Later in the evening, Chidambaram conducted a review meeting that was attended by home secretary Aditya Padhi, director-general of police Manmohan Praharaj, superintendents of police and district collectors of Koraput, Malkangiri, Nabarangpur and Rayagada to make a ground level assessment about Maoist menace.         
	The minister reviewed the security scenario in the district, close to rebel-hit Andhra Pradesh, at the meeting and tried to chalk out strategies to fight the Maoist menace.        
	At the Koraput Circuit House he was given a Guard of Honour.        
	The home minister is slated to tour riot-torn Kandhamal tomorrow where he is slated to visit the relief camps.         
	Over 2,000 victims are still holed up in relief camps since the riots, following the murders of Swami Laxmananda Saraswati and four of his associates. He is also expected to inspect the magazine house of National Aluminium Company at Damanjodi that was targeted by the Left-wing rebels on April 12.        
	Chidambaram would meet chief minister Naveen Patnaik before flying back.        
	Hours before his visit, Maoists struck in a big way attacking a railway station, damaging communication towers and looting a block office in Koraput. The rebels also blew up three mobile phone towers, including one belonging to BSNL, at Kakiriguma, using landmines.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | China snub forces US media to India
                                                                                                           China snub forces US media to India
          TIM ARANGO                            Murdoch with his wife Wendi                                  
	New York, May 4: After many years of fervent lobbying and deal-making in China, American media companies have little to show for their efforts there and are increasingly shifting their attention instead to India.         
	Media executives still believe that Chinese audiences are receptive to Western culture  SpongeBob SquarePants is a big hit in China  but many companies have been pulling back out of frustration over censorship, piracy, strict restrictions on foreign investment and the glacial pace of its bureaucracy.        
	In recent weeks, America Online shut its operations in China, for the second time. Warner Brothers, the movie studio that shares a corporate parent with AOL in Time Warner, had plans as recently as 2006 to open more than 200 retail stores throughout China, with a local partner. Today there are no such plans.        
	No one really has a decent-size presence there, and no one seems to know how to get one, said Michael Del Nin, senior vice-president for international and corporate strategy at Time Warner. In terms of priorities, the focus is elsewhere.        
	Increasingly, that focus is India, a country with a fast-growing economy and fewer government impediments for foreign media companies. In March, the Motion Picture Association of America opened an office in India for the first time, in Mumbai. A little over four years ago, Dan Glickman became the head of the association, and he has visited China several times. The feeling was that there were greater opportunities then than there are now, he said.        
	This is a stark reversal. For many years, American media executives have extolled the potential of China, wooing executives and promoting the potential goldmine of reaching its one billion-plus population. Sumner M. Redstone, who controls Viacom and CBS, entertained Chinese officials in his Beverly Hills mansion over meals prepared by Wolfgang Puck.        
	But for media companies, frustrations have been growing. For several years, China has capped the number of foreign films that can be shown in theatres at 20. Sometimes studios back away from even seeking the approval of Chinese authorities, as Warner Brothers did last year with The Dark Knight, because of a belief that the movie would not pass muster with government censors. The Dark Knight is the second-highest grossing movie of all time, with more than $1 billion at the worldwide box office, after Titanic (in dollars not adjusted for inflation).         
	In November, Warner became the first studio to announce it would make new movies available in China over a video-on-demand at prices low enough  about 60 cents to $1  to compete with pirated versions. The service still is not under way.         
	Even with access, it is possible to reach only a tiny portion of the Chinese. In China, for example, CNN International is available only in hotels that cater to foreign business travellers and in embassies.         
	Rupert Murdoch engaged in a decade-long odyssey to entertain Chinas vast populace. Murdoch found a wife, but very little revenue. His wife, Wendi Murdoch is paid $100,000 a year to provide strategic advice on the development of MySpace China, a joint venture operated by the News Corporation, according to regulatory filings. Other than that, Murdochs activities in China are minimal.

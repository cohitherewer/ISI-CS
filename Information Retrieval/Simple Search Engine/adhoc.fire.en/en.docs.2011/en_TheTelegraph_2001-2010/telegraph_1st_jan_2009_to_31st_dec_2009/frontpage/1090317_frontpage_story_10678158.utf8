The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Court ragging rap on colleges
                                                                                                           Court ragging rap on colleges
          SAMANWAYA RAUTRAY      
	New Delhi, March 16: The Supreme Court today came down on two colleges where ragging had reportedly led to a death and a suicide attempt this month.        
	The court asked them why they shouldnt face contempt cases for failing to introduce anti-ragging measures it had ordered every educational institution and every state government to follow.        
	The court asked Andhra Pradesh and Himachal Pradesh, where the two colleges are situated, to declare through their chief secre- taries what they had done so far to comply with its orders on ragging. It directed the two states police chiefs to file action-taken reports on the cases.        
	At the Dr Rajendra Prasad Government Medical College in Tanda, Himachal, Aman Kachroo, 19, died of a burst eardrum after being beaten by four seniors amid allegations that the principal had tried to shield the accused.        
	At the Government Agriculture Engineering College in Bapatla, Andhra, a 20-year-old girl attempted suicide after allegedly being forced to dance naked by five seniors.        
	As amicus curiae Gopal Subramanium drew the courts attention to the incidents, the court said: Our apprehensions have come true. It appears the concerns expressed by this court in its orders of 2007 and 2009 have not been taken seriously.         
	It added: This prima facie amounts to contempt of court as it is a serious defiance of this courts orders.        
	Among the anti-ragging measures the court suggested are:        
	College prospectuses must make it clear that anyone found ragging would be expelled        
	Institutions must hand out exemplary and harsh punishment for ragging        
	If the victim or his guardians are unhappy with the punishment, the college must file an FIR or face negligence charges.

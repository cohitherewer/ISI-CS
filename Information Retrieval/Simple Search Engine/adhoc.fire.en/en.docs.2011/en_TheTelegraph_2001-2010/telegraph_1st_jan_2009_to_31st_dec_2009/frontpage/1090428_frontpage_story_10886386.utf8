          IAN JOHNSTON                            Keira: Hard hitting                                  
	London, April 27: Censors are refusing to allow an advertising campaign against domestic violence featuring Keira Knightley to be shown in full on television.         
	 Clearcast, the company which censors adverts on behalf of Ofcom, has reportedly ruled that scenes showing the star of Atonement and Pirates of the Caribbean being thrown to the ground and kicked must be removed before it can be broadcast.        
	The advert, made by the charity Womens Aid, has been shown in cinemas and viewed more than a million times on the Internet.         
	Called The Cut, it shows Knightley returning home from shooting a new film to be confronted by her boyfriend, who accuses her of having an affair. He then attacks her and she is last seen being kicked repeatedly while lying on the floor. It is this last scene that has been deemed too shocking for a television audience.        
	Womens Aid said it felt the film was justified as it portrayed the reality of domestic violence.        
	We were very careful to reflect what we had heard from anecdotal evidence. We have put this forward to Clearcast, with statistics from the home office, and other material, said Lucy Brown, of the charity.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Techies wife stabbed to death 
                                                                                                           Techies wife stabbed to death 
          A STAFF REPORTER                                              Sushmita Biswas (top) and her daughter      
	Calcutta, Aug. 29: A software engineers wife was stabbed in her parents house in Sinthi last night apparently because a cousin had failed to repay a loan, the unprecedented murder motive leaving police nonplussed.        
	Sushmita Biswas, 33, a homemaker and mother of a 19-month-old girl, had answered the door when two young men came calling at 10pm at the two-storey house in Santrapara Lane on the citys northern fringes.        
	When they asked for the money, Sushmita  who lived next door and had come over for a visit  said she knew nothing about the loan and a quarrel broke out, the police said.        
	The attackers dragged her by the hand towards the door, apparently trying to pull off her gold bangles, said her mother Manideepa Dutta, the lone witness. When Sushmita screamed, they stabbed her in the lower abdomen and left her bleeding on the floor. She died at RG Kar Medical College Hospital.        
	Police sources said Sushmitas cousin Krishnendu, an unemployed man in his mid-thirties, may have failed to repay some local moneylenders.        
	Officers said they couldnt remember anyone being murdered over a relatives unpaid loans. Helpless women are occasionally killed for gain, but to kill a woman for money borrowed by her cousin is unprecedented in the recent past, a source said.        
	The police believe the killers were able to snatch Sushmitas gold chain before fleeing.        
	If the only motive was to recover the money, they would have fled with the gold chain instead of killing her, said joint commissioner, headquarters, Jawed Shamim. This opens an intriguing angle.        
	Another officer said the killers may have panicked when Sushmita began screaming and stabbed her. It was a single stab with a knife, he said.        
	Manideepa said Sushmita had come over because husband Rakesh, a network engineer with an IT major, was in office. When she opened the door, two young men, neither of whom I had seen before, asked about Krishnendu.        
	Krishnendu and his parents once lived in the same house but had shifted to a nearby locality seven months ago. When Sushmita told them Krishnendu no longer lived here, they refused to believe her and insisted she return the money on his behalf, Manideepa said. They grew furious when she refused and attacked.        
	The police have detained Krishnendu for questioning. Sushmitas husband was too distraught to speak.

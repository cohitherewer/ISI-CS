  - History slips away from 59-year-old Watsons grasp                                Watson during the British Open championship at the Turnberry Golf Club. (Reuters)                                 
	Turnberry (Scotland), July 19: Two months shy of 60, Tom Watson could easily have been just another elderly man pottering about the golf course on a Scottish holiday.        
	Except that he today nearly pulled off something no 59-year-old  heck, no 49-year-old  has ever done: win one of golfs four majors.        
	The American led a field of 155 at the British Open till the last and 72nd hole before, for the first time this miraculous week, he showed his age and missed an eight-foot putt.        
	He then lost a four-hole playoff to 36-year-old Stewart Cink, squandering a chance to become the oldest by 11 years to win a major and bust Julius Boross record at 48 years, set when Watson was just 18.        
	Not that Watson winning a major is a surprise in itself  he has eight, including five British Opens. But that was between 1975 and 1983, during which he was world No. 1 for four years. Now he has a replaced left hip and deeply creased cheeks.        
	And, of course, wisdom: he had hedged his bets, signing a deal with ABC to join its TV commentary team in case he failed to make the cut. Instead, it was tournament favourite Tiger Woods, 33, who made that early exit.        
	But at 59, would Watson have the hunger? Umm, it was Englishman Ross Fisher, 28, who declared he would leave the tournament even on the last day if his wife went into labour.        
	Still, Watson had his doubts. The first day here, Yeah, let the old geezer have his day in the sun, he had said. The second day you said, Well, thats OK        
	That he came so close is because of the sport he chose: golf needs less speed, explosiveness or strength than, say, soccer or cycling. For all that, even cycling legend Lance Armstrong, who has himself come out of retirement to chase his eighth Tour de France title, was keeping an eye on Turnberry from France. How about Tom Watson? he wrote on Twitter. Incredible.        
	Watson was clearly the star of the week. Yet he is most unlikely to ever return to the Open.        
	Past champions are generally allowed to play only till theyre 60, a rule Watson opposes. But theres an overriding clause that any champion can play on for a decade, so a win today would have allowed him to hang around till he was 69.        
	That may have pitted him against the man who toppled him from No. 1 in 1983. Spaniard Seve Ballesteros, 53, who retired last year after four brain surgeries to remove a tumour the size of a golf ball, yesterday said that inspired by Watson, he planned a comeback for next years Open.        
	Watson takes back a wealth of memories. It was Turnberry that saw his finest hour 32 years ago, when he won his legendary Duel in the Sun with Jack Nicklaus, perhaps the greatest golfer ever, and won by a single shot.        
	Thats why all the Scottish fans were supporting him this time; and thats why the door above his hotel room sported a brass plaque bearing his name.                    WRITTEN WITH LAT-WP AND AGENCY REPORTS

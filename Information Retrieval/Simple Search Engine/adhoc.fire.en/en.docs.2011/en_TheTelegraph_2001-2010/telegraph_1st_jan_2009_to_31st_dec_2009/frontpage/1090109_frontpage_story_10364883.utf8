                                                                                                           Blast accused dies in encounter
          A STAFF REPORTER                                    
	Guwahati, Jan. 8: Assam police tonight claimed to have gunned down Pranjal Deka, the main suspect in the New Years day serial blasts in the state capital, in an encounter in a village, 60km from Guwahati.         
	The encounter took place around 6.30pm today at Halikuchi on the bank of the Nonoi in Kamrup district. The river runs through the two districts of Nalbari and Kamrup.         
	Assam director-general of police, G.M. Srivastava, told The Telegraph, We have identified the victim as Pranjal Deka, the main accused in the blasts. Another person was injured in the encounter but escaped. He is yet to be identified. We will catch him soon.         
	The police had released the photograph of the 20-year-old Ulfa militant on January 2. He was from Dwarkuchi village in Baksa district and the eldest son of a poor farmer, Putul Deka.         
	He belonged to the 709 battalion of Ulfa. The outfit had denied its role in the blasts.        
	A senior police official said Pranjal was spotted by a surrendered Ulfa militant. Tipped off, Nalbari police raided the area where Pranjal was hiding. We launched an operation using Sulfa spotters in the area in the morning but failed to locate Pranjal. But in the afternoon we again received specific information that Pranjal was still hiding in the area. Finally, when we arrived at the village, we saw two persons running through a paddy filed. We tried to stop them but they kept on running and firing at us, forcing us to fire back, said a police official, who was part of the team.         
	He said the person who escaped was wearing a lungi. The police seized explosives and a pistol from the site of the encounter.        
	According to the police, Pranjal had dumped the bomb in a dustbin in Birubari, which exploded. It was the first among the three blasts on New Years day. He had set the timer of the bomb but could not plant at a desired location because of heavy presence of security personnel. He finally dumped it in the dustbin, a senior police official had told The Telegraph then.         
	The serial blasts at Birubari, Bhootnath and Bhangagarh here coincided with the maiden visit of P. Chidambaram to Assam where the home minister had come for a meeting with the Unified Command along with chief minister Tarun Gogoi on January 2 for a review of the security situation.         
	This evenings encounter came a few hours after arrested Ulfa member Sanjib Talukdar, another accused in the serial blasts, was taken to Bhootnath to show the police how and where he had parked the explosives-laden bicycle there.         
	The police had confirmed that Talukdar had carried out the blast in the Bhootnath market, which the home minister was scheduled to cross hours later on his way to the city from the airport.         
	Five persons were killed in the blast.         
	Today, the police had to hurriedly escort Talukdar back to prison after a crowd which had gathered there became restive at the sight of the blast accused ( ).        
	The encounter is a clear signal to the militant outfits that the state government will come down heavily on those indulging in subversive activities.         
	This was made more than evident when Chidambaram told reporters that the police chief had assured him that they would catch one of the identified accused soon.         
	He had said the security forces would deal decisively and firmly with those who are members of banned organisations which threaten the countrys sovereignty and security.

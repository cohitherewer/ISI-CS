The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Tragedy of Sania, 1 year 11 months: bullet kills baby, then hits her mother
                                                                                                           Tragedy of Sania, 1 year 11 months: bullet kills baby, then hits her mother
          IMRAN AHMED SIDDIQUI                  
	Nandigram, May 8: The politically conscious state that threw up the highest turnout yesterday also witnessed the death of probably the youngest victim of political violence this election.        
	Sania Khatoun, a year and 11 months old, was in mother Aleya Bibis lap last night, being fed her dinner, when alleged CPM supporters entered their home and opened indiscriminate fire. One of the bullets went through Sanias leg, and then lodged in the stomach of Aleya, 27.        
	No political party in Bengal could recall anyone as young as Sania being killed in poll violence in recent memory. During last years panchayat elections, Mili Khatoon, 4, was killed by a bomb as she played on the verandah of her home in Murshidabads Talibpur village.        
	No one has been arrested for Sanias murder because no one has filed any complaint, East Midnapore superintendent of police P.K. Ghosh said.        
	Sania bled to death on the way from Satengabari village to a Tamluk hospital, where Aleya lay in the female surgical ward today, recuperating from an operation to remove the bullet. Hospital authorities and relatives have told her Sania is in the paediatric ward and is recovering. Aleyas husband Sheikh Safiul Ali, a tailor in Delhi, is on his way home.        
	I wonder how my baby is doing. I remember very little of what happened last night, Aleya said in a weak voice.        
	All I remember is that there was a lot of chaos, shouting and people with flashlights roaming around the house. Sania was in my lap and I was feeding her rice. Then there was firing and I felt a searing pain.        
	The gunmen, allegedly hunting down Opposition supporters for defying a diktat not to vote, seemed to be looking for the wife of a local Trinamul leader who took shelter in Aleyas home.        
	Sanyara Bibi alleged the gang had come looking for her and husband Mir Raushan Ali. I saw them coming because they were shouting. I ran to Aleya Bibis home and hid under the bed, Sanyara said.        
	When they found my house empty, they searched Aleyas home but could not find me. But they were sure I was there, so they fired at random, killing poor Sania.        
	Police sources corroborated that armed CPM cadres had travelled from village to village last night in Amdabad II, the only one among Nandigrams 17 gram panchayats that the Marxists won in last years rural polls. Their targets, Opposition supporters alleged, were Trinamul leaders who had motivated the villagers to vote.        
	The district administration admitted receiving reports of Trinamul supporters being threatened and warned not to vote.        
	Yes, we had received such complaints and informed the police, said Nandigrams block development officer, Aniruddha Chattopadhyay. The local police said they had no idea about this.        
	Unlike the November 2007 recapture of Nandigram, the gunmen did not come on motorcycles; they quietly slipped into Amdabad II on foot four nights before the election. Thereafter, they visited Trinamul homes every night and threatened families that they would be killed if they dared vote, Sanyara said.        
	The polling itself was by and large peaceful with a large number of police around; the violence flared only at night when there were fewer personnel around. They took advantage of the relaxed atmosphere after the peaceful polling, an officer said.        
	The gunmen disappeared from Nandigram after the violence, which included a 45-year-old Trinamul supporter being beaten to death in Satengabari. From what we have gathered, they went back to Keshpur, the officer said.        
	CPM district secretary Ashok Guria said there had been firing both by his party and Trinamul. Sania was killed when a Trinamul supporter opened fire.        
	Home secretary Ardhendu Sen has sought a report from district magistrate C.D. Lama.

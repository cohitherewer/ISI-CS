                                Fonseka                            
	Colombo, Nov. 12 (Reuters): Sri Lankas top general, who engineered the defeat of the LTTE after a 25-year war, has resigned, sources said today, amid speculation he will run for President as an Opposition candidate.        
	General Sarath Fonseka is expected to challenge his commander-in-chief, President Mahinda Rajapaksa, in an election due to be held by April.        
	If Fonseka enters the race, analysts expect it to weaken Rajapaksas core voter base and erode the incumbents present monopoly on claiming political capital from the war victory.        
	General Fonseka had submitted his resignation to the President, a military source told Reuters, asking not to named. Another defence official said the resignation had been sent.

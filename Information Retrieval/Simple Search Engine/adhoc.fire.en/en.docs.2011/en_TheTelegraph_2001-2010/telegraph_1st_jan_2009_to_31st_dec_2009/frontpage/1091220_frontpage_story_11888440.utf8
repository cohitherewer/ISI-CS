          SHASHANK SHEKHAR                              
	Bokaro, Dec. 19: JMM chief Shibu Soren has expressed his wish to become chief minister of Jharkhand once again, having already been approached by both the Congress and the BJP who realise they might need his support to make up the numbers to form the next government in the state.        
	I do want to become chief minister of Jharkhand again and show results within one year, seeing to it that Jharkhand develops. So, why talk about anyone else coming to power at this juncture, he asked while tending to his cows at his Chira Chas farmhouse today.        
	Soren admitted that the BJPs Arun Jaitley had met him, but refused to elaborate on what transpired between them. He said even the Congress had sent feelers as everyone was fully aware that no party would be able to form a government as no one would get absolute majority.        
	Indicating that he was ready to play kingmaker, Soren made it clear that he would extract his pound of flesh before committing support to anyone. Without me no government can be formed in Jharkhand, the JMM chief said.        
	Asked, which of the two among the Congress and the BJP he would prefer to support, Soren said, Just wait for four more days to know who I will support, the same Shibu Soren who has been ditched by everyone  name any party.        
	If there was a hint of bitterness in that, Guruji changed tone immediately, revealing the wily politician he is. My doors are open, but let the results trickle in on Wednesday, he added.        
	Soren reached Bokaro early this morning from the state capital. After a light breakfast at his Sector-I residence, he left home for his farmhouse. In between, according to sources close to him, the JMM leader met leaders of the UPA and the NDA separately.         
	He even spoke to a senior BJP leader in Delhi, before reaching the farmhouse around 4 pm when he met a group of partymen.

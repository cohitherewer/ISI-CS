                                                                                                           Suu Kyi trial begins
                                Suu Kyi                            
	Yangon, May 20 (Reuters): Army-ruled Myanmar opened the trial of Opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi today in an apparent bid to calm growing international outrage at the regime and its latest crackdown on the Nobel Peace laureate.        
	Suu Kyi appeared healthy and confident during the 45-minute hearing watched by some 30 diplomats and a handful of Myanmarese journalists on the third day of her trial inside Yangons notorious Insein Central Prison.        
	The 63-year-old faces up to five years in jail if found guilty of breaking the terms of her latest house arrest. Thank you very much for coming and for your support, Suu Kyi, dressed in a pink blouse and maroon-coloured tied skirt, said.

                                Pakistani lawyers offer sweets to each other to celebrate the Supreme Court verdict against Musharraf. (AFP)                            
	Islamabad, Aug. 1 (PTI): Saudi Arabia has said it would consider offering political asylum to former President and army chief Pervez Musharraf if he made a request.        
	Musharraf, who is in London on a lecture tour, refused to comment on the the apex courts landmark verdict yesterday when a TV news channel managed to locate him.        
	The former President said he would give his reaction only after reading the verdict.        
	Saudi ambassador Abdul Aziz bin Ibrahim Al Ghadeer, told reporters yesterday that his country would consider giving Musharraf political asylum if the former military ruler made a request.        
	Though the prospect of Musharraf being brought to trial appears unlikely at the moment.         
	Anyone accused of violating the Constitution can be tried for treason if the federal government decides to seek such proceedings.        
	Musharraf, who has been abroad since he left Pakistan in mid-April to deliver a series of lectures around the world, continues to enjoy the backing of the army which he once led.        
	Though leaders of the influential lawyers movement have been calling for Musharraf to be tried for treason, the civilian government is unlikely to have a confrontation with the army over the issue.         
	The Supreme Court judgement declared that Musharrafs imposition of emergency on November 3, 2007, was illegal and unconstitutional.         
	The apex court had issued a notice to Musharraf to appear before it to explain his actions but he chose to ignore it.        
	The order noted that several military rulers had desecrated Pakistans Constitution and not allowed the sovereignty of people to flourish and get deep-rooted in the polity of our country.

          OUR BUREAU                              
	New Delhi, Dec. 5: Prime Minister Manmohan Singh will attend the Copenhagen Summit on climate change on December 18, heeding calls from world leaders who started piling intense pressure on him during the Commonwealth meeting last month.        
	Singh, who is starting his Moscow tour tomorrow, will leave Delhi on December 17 to attend the climate summit, the Prime Ministers Office said.        
	In Port of Spain last month, French President Nicolas Sarkozy had told a news conference after having lunch with Singh that he was confident the Prime Minister would be present at Copenhagen.         
	President Barack Obama had also spoken to Singh this week. Obama is also scheduled to be in Copenhagen on December 18.        
	Around 80 Presidents and Prime Ministers are expected to attend the summit on December 17-18. The Copenhagen talks will get off the ground on Monday.        
	The PMO announcement came on a day climate policy analysts and political parties expressed fears that India appeared to be pulling itself away from its traditional negotiating stance.        
	They said the content of the statement on climate change made by environment minister Jairam Ramesh in Parliament on Thursday indicated a deviation.        
	While India has consistently maintained that it expects deep cuts in greenhouse gas emissions from the industrialised countries as they are primarily responsible for accumulated emissions, such a demand was missing in Rameshs statement.         
	The minister focused on unilateral action by India without saying anything about the need for deep (emissions) cuts by industrialised countries as reciprocal action, quot; said T. Jayaraman, chairperson of the Centre for Science Technology and Society at the Tata Institute of Social Sciences, Mumbai.         
	India is not a carbon superpower -- if we take on actions to limit our growth of emissions, and the industrialised countries dont to enough, well still face the impacts of climate change, quot; Jayaraman said.        
	The CPM alleged that Ramesh has introduced modifications and caveats to Indias fundamental negotiating position on climate change.         
	One of Indias key assertions, articulated by the Prime Minister, was that it would not allow its per capita emissions to exceed those of the industrialised countries.         
	Ramesh had said India needed to go beyond arguments based only on per capita emissions. Indias advantage of low per capita emissions, he said, springs from an accident of history.        
	It so happens that we could not control our population. Thats why we get the benefit of per capita, Ramesh had said, prompting the CPM to say the minister has deviated even from the position that the Prime Minister has taken.        
	Environmental groups said they are surprised by the ministers remarks. If our population is an accident of history, then high consumption by the populations ) in industrialised countries) is a disaster of history, said Sunita Narain, director of the Centre for Science and Environment.

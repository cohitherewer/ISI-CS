          SAMYABRATA RAY GOSWAMI                            Lalit Modi                                  
	Mumbai, Nov. 16: Warding off pressure from team owners, Lalit Modi has been able to wrest the mandate for the inclusion of two more teams in the Indian Premier League from Season IV in 2011.        
	The IPL governing council wrapped up a two-day workshop with the eight current team owners in Bangkok last week.        
	We faced tremendous opposition from the team owners to the inclusion of two new teams. They felt further division of the telecast rights pie with the admission of newcomers would affect their bottom lines. Finally, seven of the eight teams agreed. The auction for the new teams will take place in January 2010, said an IPL official who returned from Bangkok this weekend.        
	Sources said the dissenting team was Chennai Super Kings, owned by N. Srinivasan, Board of Control for Cricket in India secretary.        
	IPL teams now earn the largest chunk of their revenues from the $1.026-billion broadcast deal the board struck with the Sony-WSG consortium in January 2008, which was reworked last March.        
	It was agreed that initially, 80 per cent of the revenues from the sale of media rights would be divided equally among the eight IPL franchises. Over the years, that would be tapered down to 60 per cent.        
	The tapering off will begin once the new teams come into the fray. So the franchisees were not happy. We agreed to some give-and-take, the IPL official said.        
	The IPL has accepted some of the demands from the team owners. Season III onwards, there will not be any 12th man. The position is being scrapped as it is a waste of money.         
	In return, we have agreed to four fielding substitutes  they can replace tired fielders. It is very useful for the teams, the official said.        
	The IPL has also given in to the team owners demand to scrap the icon player slot from Season III.        
	It is a huge drain on franchisee resources. Plus, many of the current icon players are past their prime and if you go by their on-field performances, they dont deserve the high value they commanded, the IPL official said.        
	The total time-out during the matches has been reduced from 15 to 10 minutes, with four 2.5-minute breaks.        
	The IPL governing council has also decided to open its doors to Indian Cricket League players, but theres a catch. They wont make it to the auction grade like international players. Like domestic players, they will be paid between $18,000 and $45,000 under an agreed contract between them and the team owners.        
	The franchise owners are expected to fill up their ranks  especially those for fielding substitutes  from this domestic pool. They are young, energetic and in search of exposure. The arrangement will benefit the franchisees and the players, the IPL official said.        
	Also, cricketers who skip the IPL despite the absence of national assignments will have their contracts terminated unless they have a genuine reason for their no-show.        
	IPL Season 3 will be a 60-match series, beginning March 12 next year and continuing till April 25. There will be four new venues ---- Dharamsala, Nagpur, Visakhapatnam and Ahmedabad --- which will host some of the matches of Kings XI Punjab and the Mumbai Indians.        
	The first match will be between the Kolkata Knight Riders and the Deccan Chargers in Hyderabad.

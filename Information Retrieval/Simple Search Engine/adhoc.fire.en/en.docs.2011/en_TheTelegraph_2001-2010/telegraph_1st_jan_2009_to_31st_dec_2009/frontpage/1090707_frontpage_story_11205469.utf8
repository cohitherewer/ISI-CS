The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Surcharge waiver to help high earners
                                                                                                           Surcharge waiver to help high earners
          SRIKUMAR BONDYOPADHAYAY                              
	Calcutta, July 6: The more you earn, the more you gain. Elders, too, stand to benefit more than the young.        
	The budget proposals on personal income-tax will benefit high earners more than those in the low and middle income brackets.        
	If you earn Rs 30 lakh a year, you will save as much as Rs 62,830 from your tax payout. In contrast, if your annual income is Rs 5 lakh, your savings will be limited to Rs 1,030 a year or less than Rs 90 a month.        
	Finance minister Pranab Mukherjee proposed to withdraw the 10 per cent surcharge on income-tax that has so far been levied on individuals earning over Rs 10 lakh a year. Till now, such high earners were required to pay tax at an effective rate of 33 per cent. Following the withdrawal of the surcharge, they will pay tax at the rate of 30 per cent.         
	While the finance minister decided to withdraw the surcharge, he retained the education cess of 3 per cent (2 per cent cess for basic education and another 1 per cent for secondary and higher secondary education).         
	Not that the finance minister has completely ignored those in the other income brackets. He has proposed to raise the basic exemption limit on annual income for tax liability by Rs 10,000 for those aged below 65 and by Rs 15,000 for senior citizens (65 years or above before the year of assessment).        
	This means men aged below 65 need not pay tax for Rs 1.6 lakh, women for Rs 1.9 lakh and senior citizens for Rs 2.4 lakh of their annual income.        
	An income taxpayer aged 65 or above will save more than a younger person. For income up to Rs 10 lakh, a senior citizen will save Rs 1,545 compared with Rs 1,030 for others in the same bracket.        
	Respite has also been offered on payment of advance tax. From this financial year, unless a taxpayer has a tax liability of Rs 10,000 or more, the person will not have to pay advance tax. Till now, all assessees who had a liability of Rs 5,000 or more had to pay advance tax within the specified quarterly dates.         
	The threshold limit for wealth tax (a levy on the movable and immovable assets like house and jewellery which not many people pay) has been increased to Rs 30 lakh from Rs 15 lakh.        
	Taxpayers may also get a breather from filing cumbersome ITRs (income-tax return forms). The finance minister said he was holding discussions with the income-tax department for bringing back in a new avatar the simplified Saral forms.        
	If you have generous friends, a word of caution. Income-tax will be applicable to immovable properties given as gifts by non-relatives. Till now, gifts in kind did not attract any tax.

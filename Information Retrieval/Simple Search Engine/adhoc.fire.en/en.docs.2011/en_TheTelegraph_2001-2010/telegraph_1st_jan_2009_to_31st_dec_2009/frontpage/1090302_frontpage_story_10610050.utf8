          NALIN VERMA AND GAUTAM SARKAR                                              
	Patna/Bhagalpur, March 1: Maoists blew up railway tracks and torched a station in two separate incidents in Bihar since last night, barely 18 hours after they attacked a station on the Jharkhand-Orissa border.        
	The rebels also abducted some railway officials, but released them later.        
	Lalit Kumar, the assistant station manager at Mungers Ratanpur halt on Bhagalpur-Kiul loop section of Eastern Railway, said about 70-80 armed Maoists took him and other railway officials hostage around 10.10pm yesterday and set the station ablaze.         
	Later, around 2am, the Maoists kidnapped an assistant station manager, a booking clerk and a porter from Bhalui halt on Patna-Asansol section of Eastern Railway before triggering explosions on both up and down tracks. The abducted persons were set free near an irrigation canal, some 2km from the station in Lakhisarai district, said deputy inspector-general of police (Munger) Amit Kumar.        
	The blast  taking place hardly 15 minutes after the Howrah-Raxaul Mithila Express passed the spot  uprooted both the tracks, damaging the overhead traction wires and lighting system, Eastern Railway chief public relation officer A.K. Chandra said.        
	Railway minister Lalu Prasad alleged that the GRP had not been protecting railway property. Law and order situation has gone haywire in Bihar, said Lalu Prasad.        
	Chandra said: Traffic was restored at 9.30am on both the up and down directions.

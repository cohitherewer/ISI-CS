The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Shashi shift: holy cows to UN holy grail
                                                                                                           Shashi shift: holy cows to UN holy grail
          JAYANTH JACOB                            Shashi Tharoor                                  
	New Delhi, Oct. 3: Shashi Tharoor is confident of being second-time lucky  and no, he is not talking about taking another shot at holy cows on Twitter.        
	Tharoor, whose campaign for United Nations secretary-general had come to grief three years ago, is feeling optimistic about the groundwork he is doing as New Delhi again bids for a key UN position.        
	The junior foreign minister is part of Indias campaign for a Security Council seat as a non-permanent member, a position that eluded New Delhi when it last contested the election in 1996. Tharoor has been canvassing support in foreign capitals during bilateral trips.        
	I have not only taken up the subject (during his recent visit to Liberia) but I have obtained Liberias support for our candidature, Tharoor told The Telegraph. I am confident, though I should stress that the election is still a year away.        
	Elections will be held in October 2010 for the five seats up for grabs for 2011-12, with only one of them available to Asia. India has not been a (non-permanent) Security Council member since 1991-92, and in 1996 it was drubbed 40-142 by Japan, the highest donor to the UN after the US.        
	Tharoor will use his forthcoming visits to Bahrain and the UAE to marshal support. He will be in Bahrain tomorrow and the day after, and the next three days in the UAE.         
	We are working hard, and it (the campaign) is a work in progress. We are ensuring that we dont get our calculations wrong the way it happened in 1996, a ministry official said.        
	Indian officials are lobbying with the 192 voting countries. The work is being done now on the sidelines of the ongoing UN General Assembly (in New York), the ministry official said.        
	Kazakhstan, with which Delhi has been strengthening ties, appears a strong contender. The central Asian nation has never been a (non-permanent) member of the Security Council.        
	The UNs five permanent members with veto powers the US, Britain, Russia, China and France  may be its holy cows but its 10 non-permanent members arent quite cattle class, considering the councils importance.         
	Each of the 10 is elected for a two-year term, with five replaced every year. Of the 10, two must be from Asia and one from an Arab country, either from Asia or Africa.        
	On January 1, 2010, Japan will take up one Asian seat. New Delhi is looking to win the seat to be vacated by Vietnam on December 31, 2010.        
	Indias eventual ambition is to get a permanent berth in the Security Council but the proposed reforms that will make this possible have made little headway. New Delhi had sought the secretary-generals post, fielding Tharoor in 2006, but he had pulled out after the US voted against him.

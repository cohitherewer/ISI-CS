          RICHARD OWEN                            DAddario                                  
	Rome, June 19: A showgirl who claims that she and other women were paid to attend Silvio Berlusconis private parties said yesterday that she had pictures showing her with the Italian Prime Minister in his bedroom.         
	Patrizia DAddario, a former model and escort girl, said that she had given prosecutors audio tapes but also had secretly recorded video footage of her encounters in the Prime Ministers Rome residence.         
	DAddario, 42, who was yesterday described by a senior government figure as a high-class prostitute, said that the footage showed her standing in front of a mirror. A bedroom with a framed photograph of Veronica Lario, Berlusconis estranged wife, was in view. She said she had made the recordings so that nobody could deny I had been there.         
	Police said they were checking DAddarios footage to ensure that the rooms shown were in the Prime Ministers Palazzo Grazioli and that the voice on her tapes was Berlusconis.         
	Three other women who claim that they were paid to attend Berlusconis parties have also been interviewed. Berlusconi, 72, who is not himself under investigation, has dismissed the allegations.

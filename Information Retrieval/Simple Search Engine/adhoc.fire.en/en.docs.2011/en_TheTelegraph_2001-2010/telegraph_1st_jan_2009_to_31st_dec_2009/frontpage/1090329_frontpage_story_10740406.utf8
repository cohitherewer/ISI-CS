The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Poll panel glare on state DA hike
                                                                                                           Poll panel glare on state DA hike
          SUDHIR KUMAR MISHRA                              
	Ranchi, March 28: Election Commissioner S.Y. Quraishi today said that Raj Bhavan had not taken prior permission before announcing key policy decisions such as the 6 per cent DA hike for state staff, indicating the election commission had its radar fixed on Jharkhand which has been under Presidents rule since January 19.        
	Quraishi said an explanation had already been sought from Raj Bhavan on policy decisions taken after the model code of conduct came into force. Adding that Governor Syed Sibtey Razi was yet to reply, the election commissioner clarified that the governors role, as the chief executive officer of the state during Presidents rule, did come under the purview of the poll panel.        
	Razis advisory council okayed the DA hike on March 24. But when the BJP alleged it was a violation of the poll code, a Raj Bhavan spokesman argued that a DA revision for the state was due since January when it was cleared for Union government staff.        
	Quraishi said the state DGP V.D. Ram, would also be under the commissions scanner, because his brother-in-law Radha Krishna Kishore was contesting elections from Palamau. Ram, he added, would be asked to stay away from election work if it was found he was misusing his position, though no one had complained yet, he said.         
	But, hereafter we will be keeping tabs on the DGP. In fact, the DGPs role during elections is limited. Deployment of forces are being done by an official of ADG rank.        
	Quraishi also expressed shock over peoples complaints about names missing from the voters list and that only 75 per cent voters had received their photo identity cards till now. He directed the states chief electoral officer, Debashish Gupta, to act on this immediately. Jharkhands performance on this front has been dismal, he added.        
	Quraishi ordered the immediate suspension of Khunti deputy development commissioner Pankaj Mishra for allegedly neglecting election work. Quraishis observations on Raj Bhavan had its desired effect. The governors advisory council forwarded eight routine administrative proposals to the Election Commission for approval this evening.         
	The proposals were to allot free land to the STF in Kanke, clear funds under JNNURM for Ranchi (Rs 2.71 cr from the state in a total of Rs 51.54cr) and Dhanbad (Rs 6.62cr in a total of Rs 55.85cr) and for the Greater Ranchi Development Authority (Rs 9cr).

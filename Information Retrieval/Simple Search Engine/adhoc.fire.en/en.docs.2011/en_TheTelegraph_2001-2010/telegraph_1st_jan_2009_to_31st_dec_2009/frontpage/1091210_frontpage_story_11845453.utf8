	Ranchi, Dec. 9: Final polling figures for the third phase released today show a short, but significant, climb to 57.21 per cent from an earlier 55.27.        
	While Jarmundi remains at the top with 64.86 per cent, Chandankiyari has pipped Dumka to be a close second with 64.77 per cent.        
	The voting percentage of all, but three seats  Dumka, Jamua and Hazaribagh  where the final tally was marginally less than initial figures, increased by a fair margin of around two per cent.        
	Bokaro has improved with 44.95 per cent, but still remains at the bottom of the turnout list.         
	The third phase tally, like the initial count, was better than that of the first phase (53.10 per cent) and lesser than that of the second phase (58.82). The final tally in these 11 seats (Jarmundi, Chandankiyari, Dumka, Sikaripara, Dhanwar, Jama, Bagoder, Bermo, Dumka, Jamua, Hazaribagh and Bokaro) in 2005 was 56.75 per cent.        
	State joint chief electoral officer Ashok Kumar Sinha said no re-polling in this phase indicated smooth voting.        
	The poll panel is now working overtime to ensure free, fair and peaceful elections in 14 Assembly seats in the fourth phase on Saturday.         
	The seats include Naxalite strongholds of Ghatshila, Manoharpur, Chakradharpur, Simdega, Torpa, Kolebira, Gumla and Lohardaga.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | At Writers, AC charity does not begin at home 
                                                                                                           At Writers, AC charity does not begin at home 
          KINSUK BASU                                               
	Calcutta, June 10: Writers Buildings kept buzzing well past 6pm today but home secretary Ardhendu Sen is unlikely to have been gratified.        
	The telltale whirr came not from workaholic bureaucrats but from air-conditioners that cooled empty rooms as lakhs of houses went without power again for several hours on Wednesday. A CESC unit was repaired this evening but it tripped again a few hours later.        
	The well-meaning home secretary had advised Calcuttans yesterday to switch off ACs after 6pm to help save power in their neighbourhoods. Using AC by one household might affect 10 to 15 homes in terms of power consumption, Sen had said on Tuesday.        
	However, someone forgot to pass the message down the corridors where Sen works. Both on Tuesday and Wednesday, several AC units at Writers kept guzzling power till at least 7.30pm.        
	The matter goes far beyond nit-picking when a count is taken. The seat of power has around 450 AC units with capacity of 1.5 to 2 tonnes.         
	Besides, four package units, each with a capacity of 15 tonnes, service larger areas like the cabinet meeting room and the rotunda. The chief ministers office and chamber is cooled by a separate system.        
	If Sens calculation is applied, at least 6,000 homes would have got power had all the AC units been switched off at Writers after 6pm. Sen, who was in Delhi during the day, could not be contacted.        
	Most of the people do not care about switching off the lights and fans, leave aside AC. When we go to lock the doors, we switch them off, said an employee of the caretaker unit of the PWD.         
	On Wednesday, in the room of an executive engineer of the PWD, the AC was on full blast well beyond 6pm, though there was no one in the room. A PWD employee said the engineer had left for the day.         
	This is nothing new as there is no effort to save energy Very few people care about switching off ACs or lights, said an official in the electrical department.         
	So, in keeping with the exalted traditions of governance, an entire caretaker unit has been entrusted with the noble task of switching off lights. Around 175 employees who work in shifts have to check 1,500 rooms and toggle down the switches every day. The process takes at least an hour.        
	The power consumption at Writers is 1.8MW and a part of it gets wasted as lights, fans and AC units are not switched off till at least an hour after people leave, said an official.

          OUR BUREAU                            Shaun Pollock: New role                                  
	March 24: IPL commissioner Lalit Modi had admitted England had significant drawbacks before leaving Mumbai for South Africa last night.        
	Weather is a problem, he said. There are 70 per cent chances of the games being disrupted by rain. The IPL will also be clashing with the London Marathon and a number of Test matches, which will be blocking hotel rooms.         
	A statement by N. Srinivasan, the honorary secretary of the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI), while thanking the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) for its generous offer, said: The climatic conditions in England during mid-April and the absence of permanent floodlights at many of the venues made South Africa the better option.        
	The issue of the ECBs broadcasting deal with Sky was a potential problem as well with the IPL screened by Sky rival Setanta. In South Africa, the issue is clearer with the same broadcaster, Supersport, owning the rights both for IPL and for international cricket in the country.        
	BCCI sources said South African authorities convinced the league organisers that the venues would be completely secured even though the presidential elections are slated for April 22.         
	Till yesterday, England was the preferred venue. But ECB had walked ahead of themselves and expressed the desire to hold the IPL without consulting British security agencies, a top BCCI official said.        
	The IPL schedule coincides with a congested period of security demands for the British force. In April, London hosts the G20 summit of world leaders, for which all police leave has been cancelled, besides the football FA Cup semi-finals and the London Marathon. A report in The Times, London, said the cost of policing the tournament could have been as much as 5 million, which the IPL would have been asked to pay.         
	Franchisees are already trying to secure their favoured home centres.        
	Durban, with its huge South Asian population, seems to be everybodys favourite  but Mumbai Indians are at present the frontrunner to get the city as eight of their junior players are training there.        
	Mumbai Indians are likely to get Durban as their home ground. But they will have to share it with one more team as there are six venues in all and eight teams. Everybody wants Durban as there are 1.2 million South Asians there and we are expecting a packed stadium, though it might not be the same elsewhere, said a BCCI source.        
	The eight players are undergoing training under former South African captain Shaun Pollock, who was recently signed on as the IPL teams mentor-cum-adviser, and fielding coach Jonty Rhodes.

   Exit polls give Cong group edge, not majority
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                                    
	New Delhi, May 13: Exit polls today gave the Congress-led alliance a slender lead over the NDA, ranging from STAR News three to Headlines Todays 11, but left both formations far short of majority and the election too close to call.        
	Even the wider lead of 20 given by the CNN-IBN, which did not do an exit poll but made projections based on expected vote swings (following a questionnaire to voters), would be little cause for complacency.        
	The Congress, though, will hope to become the fulcrum for a second and perhaps amended version of the UPA on the principle of secularism and social inclusion and under the leadership of Manmohan Singh and Sonia Gandhi.        
	Unlike perhaps the Left, many constituents of the third and fourth fronts do not have a problem with Singh continuing as Prime Minister. Their demands are driven by the political compulsions of their home states, which the Congress believes can be met as long as they are within the bounds of the Constitution.        
	The Left, however, could see its leverage vastly weakened as predicted losses in Bengal and Kerala reduce its tally from 60-plus to the mid-thirties. According to STAR News, the Left will win only 23 seats in Bengal, the remaining 19 going to the Congress-Trinamul Congress.        
	In Kerala, STAR gives the Left Democratic Front seven of the 20 seats and the Congress-led United Democratic Front 13.        
	Neither do the other constituents of the third front, CPM general secretary Prakash Karats brainchild, cover themselves in glory in the projections. STAR gives the Bahujan Samaj Party only 25 of the 80 seats in Uttar Pradesh, suggesting Mayavati has yielded vast ground since she won more than half the Assembly seats in May 2007.        
	In Andhra Pradesh, the Telugu Desam and the Left are projected to get just 13 of the 42 seats, making marginal gains despite their grand alliance with the Telengana Rashtra Samiti, which has since crossed over to the NDA. The Congress seems to have weathered any anti-incumbency and is projected to win 24 seats, a fall of only five.        
	If the simultaneous Assembly polls follow this pattern, it could be bad news for the BJP, which was hoping that N. Chandrababu Naidu would be just short of majority and would need NDA support, setting the stage for a quid pro quo in Delhi.        
	But the door is left open tantalisingly in Orissa. STAR gives the Biju Janata Dal 10 of the 21 seats, which means that a repeat show in the Assembly polls may leave Naveen Patnaik exactly where the BJP wants him.        
	Karat has more bad news from Tamil Nadu and Karnataka, where he had forged ties with Jayalalithaa and the Janata Dal (Secular). In Karnataka, both STAR and NDTV give the Dal (Secular) only two of the 28 seats.        
	Tamil Nadu has apparently broken with its tradition of cyclical swings. STAR gives the DMK-Congress 25 of the 39 seats (they had won all of them in 2004 with former allies PMK, Left and MDMK) and the ADMK front 14. NDTV gives the DMK-Congress 20, two more than Jayalalithaa.        
	The Congress is set to make gains in Orissa (STAR and CNN-IBN), Punjab (STAR) and Rajasthan (CNN-IBN). The projections from Maharashtra vary, with STAR predicting losses for the Congress-Nationalist Congress Party and gains for the BJP-Shiv Sena, while CNN-IBN says the opposite.        
	The BJP seems poised to keep its kitty intact in Madhya Pradesh, Karnataka, Gujarat and Chhattisgarh, and also in Jharkhand.        
	Surprisingly, in Uttar Pradesh, STAR predicts 21 seats for the BJP and its new ally, the Rashtriya Lok Dal  a rise of 11 since 2004. The Samajwadi Party gets 26, one more than Mayavati.        
	The exit polls predict a near clean sweep for the Janata Dal (United)-BJP in Bihar.        
	Sonia and Manmohan Singh met Pranab Mukherjee, A.K. Antony and Ahmed Patel today to discuss the Congresss own assessment, which gives the party 166 seats, sources said. This figure excludes the seats of allies NCP and DMK.        
	But one factor is keeping high the hopes of all parties: in 2004, the exit polls had gone way off the mark.

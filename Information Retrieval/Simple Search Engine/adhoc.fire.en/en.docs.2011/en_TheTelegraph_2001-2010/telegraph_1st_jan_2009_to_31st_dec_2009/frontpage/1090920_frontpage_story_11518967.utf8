The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Cong may not fall for Lalus unity pitch
                                                                                                           Cong may not fall for Lalus unity pitch
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                            Lalu                                
	New Delhi, Sept. 19: Emboldened by the RJDs success in the Bihar bypolls, Lalu Yadav met Sonia Gandhi this morning to convince her of his unflinching support, but the Congress is unlikely to accept his offer to get close in the garb of secular unity against the BJP in Jharkhand.        
	Details of what transpired between the two werent made public  Lalu is understood to have declared he would never oppose her come what may but his confidant Prem Gupta, who accompanied him to Janpath, later said the purpose was to convince Sonia on the question of a united fight in Jharkhand which could see polls in December-January.        
	In view of the bypoll success in Bihar, Lalu fancies a chance of his comeback in the state if the Congress came around to support him. Lalu had compelled the Congress to fight alone by offering it only three seats in the last Lok Sabha election.         
	Leaders associated with Jharkhand election management said the chances of an alliance with the RJD was bleak but conceded that the Congress was still studying the fluid political situation.         
	I cant fathom how the Bihar policy of keeping a distance from Lalu would be reversed in Jharkhand. But we are not in good shape in Jharkhand and the leaders are still weighing options, a senior leader said.         
	The Jharkhand unit of the party is, however, opposed to any understanding with the RJD.         
	Lalu apparently renewed efforts to reclaim his position in the UPA after the bypoll message that neither the RJD, nor Ram Vilas Paswans LJP could be written off. The RJD-LJP combine won the majority of seats in the bypolls, giving an unexpected jolt to the Nitish government in Bihar.         
	In the last Assembly elections in Jharkhand, the RJD had contested alone and the Congress had fought in alliance with the JMM. This time, the Congress is reluctant to align with the JMM.        
	Senior Congress leader from Bihar Shakeel Ahmed, who met Sonia before Lalu in the morning, favoured a hands-off policy with the RJD. He said the Congress had benefited after parting ways with Lalu in Bihar and there was a consensus that the go-it-alone principle should be persisted with.         
	Even Rahul Gandhi is very keen to strengthen the party in Uttar Pradesh and Bihar and getting back to the RJD would be a movement in reverse gear.

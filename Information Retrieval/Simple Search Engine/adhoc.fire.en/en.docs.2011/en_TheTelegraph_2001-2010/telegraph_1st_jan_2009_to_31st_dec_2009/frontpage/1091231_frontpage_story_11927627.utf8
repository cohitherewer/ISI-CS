	Calcutta, Dec. 30: Mamata Banerjee today vetoed her partys plan to gatecrash Citus year-end rally at the city centre, forcing an intersecting five-day programme to be wound up in two by saying there were bigger battles to be won than one over a venue.        
	We are calling off this event right now at our leader Mamata Banerjees instructions. By doing this, the Trinamul Congress wants to tell the ruling CPM that it believes in the politics of tolerance, leader of the Opposition Partha Chatterjee announced to applause from a sparse gathering of party supporters at the Metro channel this evening.        
	The third day of the five-day programme to commemorate Mamatas 26-day fast at the venue in 2006 over land acquisition in Singur would have clashed with a rally tomorrow by the Citu-affiliated All India Bidi Workers Federation at which chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee is scheduled to be a speaker.        
	Citu had applied for Lalbazars permission to hold the rally a month in advance, while Trinamul faxed its December 29 to January 2 itinerary a week ago, police said.        
	Taken aback by what Trinamul leaders termed Mamatas magnanimity and others a masterstroke, state Citu state secretary Kali Ghosh said: We are very happy to know that sense has prevailed, for a change. I welcome the move.         
	A source said Mamata, busy flagging off half a dozen new trains, rebuked Trinamul Youth Congress chief Madan Mitra at a meeting earlier in the day for shooting his mouth off over the clash of rallies.        
	Didi and other seniors cautioned the younger ones against sending out wrong signals. The argument was that voters would turn away from the party if the chief minister-in-waiting were to be seen inciting a confrontation in the heart of the city, the source said.        
	Mitra had yesterday warned that Bengal would be in flames if Trinamul supporters were forced to vacate the Metro channel for Citu.        
	A chastened Mitra said this evening that his outburst was against Citus uncompromising attitude. Instead of threatening us, Citu should have approached us in a civil manner and we would have obliged, he said.         
	Traffic was thrown haywire for six hours yesterday when Trinamul supporters converged on Esplanade for the start of the five-day programme but there was no disruption today with the crowd thinning, possibly because Mamata was elsewhere.        
	There was also talk of the chief minister skipping the Citu rally until Trinamul sprang a surprise by backing out. Sources said Bhattacharjee would now attend.

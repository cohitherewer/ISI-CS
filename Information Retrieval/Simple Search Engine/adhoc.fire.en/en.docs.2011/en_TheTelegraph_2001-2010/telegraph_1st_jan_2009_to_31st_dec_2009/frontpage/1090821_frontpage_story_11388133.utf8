                                                                                                           Cracks on road link to stadiums 
          AMIT GUPTA                               
	Ranchi, Aug. 20: An approach road that connects the National Games village with NH-33 near Booty More has developed cracks and cave-ins at various places, barely a month after it was completed at a cost of Rs 3 crore.        
	Road construction secretary N.N. Sinha is now going through a report filed by a three-member committee of technical experts entrusted to probe and verify the quality of the 1km road, funded by the state sports department and executed by the state road construction department.        
	The members of the committee, that was supposed to suggest remedial measures since the Games are scheduled for November, included the chief engineer of the NH wing of the state road construction department, Murari Bhagat; the chief engineer of the Central Design Organisation (CDO) wing of the department, Ram Naresh Raman; and the superintending engineer of the NH wing of Ranchi, Tripurari Shankar Prasad.        
	I am studying the findings of the committee. It talks of water logging along stretches of the road and mud-like structures getting formed on the main road. We will take suitable action against the engineers after thorough verification, Sinha said.         
	But a committee member held members of the Ranchi road division responsible for the poor construction. The entire team of the division, including executive, assistant and junior engineers should be hauled up for the poor road condition, he said on condition of anonymity.         
	 The committee members, who conducted physical inspections, have found that a drive on the road wasnt pleasant. They reported subsidence at various places and warned of the possibility of more cave-ins.         
	Besides, it seemed impossible to drain out water from several places.        
	The committee has suggested that the effected stretches be completely dug out, filled with sand, and compressed using machines before re-applying the surface material once again.        
	The road, that is now an off-shoot of NH 33 (Ranchi-Hazaribagh road) also connects the Games village with the Tatisilway side (Ranchi-Purulia road that would also connect to Ranchi-Jamshedpur road).         
	Hence, it would act as an important link for sportspersons, officials and visitors to visit stadiums during the Games.

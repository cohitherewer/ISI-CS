          OUR CORRESPONDENT                      A protester outside Inderpuri police station. (Prem Singh)                          
	New Delhi, June 23: A woman today alleged she was raped by five cops inside a police station in southwest Delhi last night.        
	The allegations by Ratna Kumar (name changed), originally from Kakinara in North 24-Parganas, incited a 300-strong mob to ransack the building housing Inderpuri police station and damage vehicles parked there.        
	Ringed by relatives in front of the police station, Ratna singled out SHO Pradeep Kumar as being one of her alleged rapists. The 24-year-old is the second wife of Dhiraj, a local bookie named in three FIRs, and stays in a lower-middle-class cluster in Inderpuri.        
	Ratna said two policemen came to her house last night and asked for Dhiraj. When she said he wasnt in, they apparently dragged her to the police station without giving reasons.         
	 They had come twice before. The last time I didnt let them in because I was ill. My neighbours had told me they wouldnt leave me alone after that. They went away abusing me, she said.        
	They forcibly took me to the second floor of the police station and raped me one by one. They let me go after threatening to kill me if I opened my mouth. I know these are powerful people, but I demand justice.        
	Ratna said she was taken to RML Hospital for medical tests by Dhirajs friends.         
	The preliminary medical reports have said there was no evidence of rape or external injury. Ratnas vaginal swabs have been sent to a forensic lab.        
	Late tonight, the crime branch, which has been given charge of the case, lodged a FIR against the five policemen at Inderpuri after visiting Ratnas home to record her statement.

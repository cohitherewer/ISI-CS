The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Crime first, consent later
                                                                                                           Crime first, consent later
                                            
	Wall defaced: March 13. Permission sought: March 18.         
	A businessman learnt this evening how the CPM can bend the Election Commission rules when some cadres approached him for consent to write poll graffiti on the 8ftx10ft wall outside his Tollygunge Road house.         
	A young man gave me a form and asked me to put my signature on it. I could not make out what they wanted. They told me that they needed my permission for using the wall for poll graffiti, he told The Telegraph.         
	The graffiti seeks votes for Rabin Deb, the CPM candidate from Calcutta South against Mamata Banerjee.        
	When the businessman asked about the relevance of permission six days after defacing the wall, one of the seniors in the team explained.         
	I was told that the signature was needed to prove to the police that they had taken permission from me. I knew it was a mockery of the rules But I smiled at them and put my signature without any fuss, said the man. Please do not put my name in your newspaper They will hound me out of the locality, he added.         
	The appeal proves that the moment the Election Commission agreed to dilute its original blanket ban, a body blow had been dealt to individual freedom, despite the panels best intentions and zeal to implement the rules.        
	The return of the CPM cadres to the businessmans house indicates the foolproof information system the party has created to beat the EC rules.         
	They got the information that some policemen visited the house and asked the owner whether he gave permission to use his wall for graffiti. To avoid any controversy, they will present the form to the cops, said a resident who was witness to the permission drama.        
	The businessman is aware that though he has signed on the form, the use of the wall without prior permission is a violation of the rule. I hope they will detect the fraud and take appropriate action and book the violators. Only exemplary punishment can stop these parties, he said.

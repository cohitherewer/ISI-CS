The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Google in talks to buy Twitter
                                                                                                           Google in talks to buy Twitter
          CLAUDINE BEAUMONT                            Hot tweet                                  
	London, April 3: Google is in late stage talks to buy the microblogging service Twitter, according to reports on the influential technology blog TechCrunch.         
	Michael Arrington, editor of the site, says that two separate people, close to the negotiations have told him that Google is on the verge of acquiring Twitter. He says that he does not know how much the deal will be worth, but expects it to be well in excess of the $250 million valuation that Twitter attracted in its last round of funding.         
	Twitters founders, Biz Stone, Evan Williams and Jack Dorsey, last year rejected overtures from Facebook to buy the microblogging service for a rumoured $500 million in stock. Peter Thiel, one of the executives involved in the negotiations, hinted that the two companies had been unable to reach an agreement on a price for the deal.         
	Google today distanced itself from the claims of a possible takeover bid. We do not comment on rumours said a spokesman.         
	Twitter has enjoyed an explosive growth in popularity over the last year, with traffic to its site up by around 974 per cent. Celebrities, politicians and companies alike have embraced the service as means of directly communicating with fans, customers and voters.         
	It famously broke the news of several major events, including the terrorist attacks in Mumbai and the Hudson plane crash in New York. The immediacy of the service, and the fact that messages, known as tweets, are visible to all Web users, has made it a powerful reporting tool and a source of some startling eyewitness accounts.         
	The acquisition of Twitter, one of the hottest properties on the Web, would make sense for Google. One of Twitters greatest strengths is in providing a real-time feed of the topics that are interesting its users. Twitter has been slow to capitalise on the search potential of this stream of data, with companies such as Twitscoop and Twitterfall filling the void.         
	Google would no doubt seek to integrate this real-time trending data into its existing search results online. Google knows well how to treat new sources of information as signals that weigh into search results, said Stephen Shankland, a reporter at Cent.

                                baring her soul                            
	London, Oct. 12: Carla Bruni-Sarkozy, the glamorous French First Lady, has reportedly been visiting a psychotherapist for the past eight years.        
	She allegedly made the disclosure during the filming of a documentary about her life for French television, which is yet to be released.        
	The Daily Mail reported that Frances Plurielles.fr website , which said it had seen clips of the programme, said: Bruni will bare her soul to the French people.        
	She is turning the traditions of how French first ladies have behaved on their head. For the first time ever, a serving First Lady will speak on television about the reasons which drove her to seek therapy eight years ago.        
	The questions that she will answer include why she sought the help of a therapist, what happened during the sessions and why she has continued them for so long.        
	The website said: She is so unpredictable and can be so open about her life, that there is no knowing what she is going to say. We do not know if Sarkozy has seen the footage, but we are sure he must have vetted it. Either way, journalists are simply waiting with bated breath.                    THE DAILY TELEGRAPH

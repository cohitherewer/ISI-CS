The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | The lost sound of results over the radio
                                                                                                           The lost sound of results over the radio
          SHYAM G. MENON                            People gather in front of a shop in Calcutta to listen to the radio broadcast of the 1957 election results                                  
	Ears ringing from television chatter and fatigued by the summer heat, we should heave a sigh of relief when counting begins.        
	Things were quieter and more engaging years ago. S.K.N. Nair, 74, recently resettled in Kerala after four decades in the north and east of the country, remembered the first two general elections.        
	The first and second elections were overwhelmingly around two themes  the personality of Nehru and getting to grasp the identity of India as a nation, he said.        
	This defining experience has stayed in the minds of many who witnessed that phase and tracked elections since, as not just the start but a benchmark of sorts. That was the beginning of modern, democratic India at a time when the people who founded it were around to argue its case.        
	R.V.G. Menon, 65, recalled that candidates put up by parties were typically freedom fighters or people with proven track record in public service.         
	According to professor R.K. Bhattacharjee, 70, former colleague of Jayaprakash Narayan and a teacher at several universities, candidates were carefully selected by political parties.        
	A great deal of public opinion was taken into consideration, he said.         
	The esteem in which parties were held was proved by the low number of Independent candidates in the fray. An election was a serious event, Menon said.                 
	It was also a huge social occasion in which the entire community participated. It had its light moments.         
	Nair recalled a man standing next to him mutte- ring Did he come all the way just to say this? when Nehru spoke in English at a school near Eramalloor in Kerala.        
	In 1971, something similar cropped up when V.K. Krishna Menon, candidate for the Thiruvananthapuram Lok Sabha seat, unhappy with his speech in Malayalam, sought permission from the audience to switch to English. He then held forth on issues ranging from foreign policy to the Cold War, all this at a sleepy roadside junction. At my home at that junction, this story is still told by elders.        
	Nair felt that the disarray of the 2009 elections was faintly reminiscent of the 1967 edition, which was the first after Nehrus demise. Many from the senior generation see the several elections that followed as a progressive slide into cynicism.        
	Reflecting the times, there was growing emphasis on what the ballot would fetch the individual voter. It reinforced verticals like religion and caste.         
	In the years since Nehru, the old concept of the national party has withered and a multitude of regional parties rooted in the vernacular have sprung up. At the same time, the previously celebrated community partici- pation in elections has given way to cadre-driven politics.        
	Where much of the effort had been voluntary, money began to count as the moving force. You could say elections have become professional but they have also got commercialised, Menon, a former professor of engineering and now a social activist, said.        
	The biggest difference in experiencing the elections was the media. Those years I depended on the radio for results. The 1977 results were particularly memorable for the flat way in which Indira Gandhis defeat was reported, Nair said.        
	Radio, an All India Radio monopoly, was listened to at specific hours.         
	It probably gave you time to think. You were not blasted with information like today, P. Devarajan, 63, a veteran journalist in Mumbai, said.        
	Unlike the present, ruled by myriad news channels with politics reduced to claims on television, campaigning was the hallmark of election politics. Politi-cians tried to meet people and thousands turned out to hear a JP, Mrinal Gore or Vajpayee.         
	Professor Bhattacharjee remembered the cartoons in the print media that spared none with a dubious reputation, making elections a hot topic of discussion. I miss that quality in debates. The discussions at Calcuttas Coffee House were so good! he said.        
	Menon added another angle. In the old days, there was both the radio and that election scoreboard installed at prominent junctions. During elections, people would gather below these boards and at places where the radio had been linked to loudspeakers.        
	Both reinforced the community tinge to the old elections. Although realtime, television has simply made the election experience personal.        
	In mid-2008, I chanced to walk over from Uttarakhand to Himachal Pradesh via the snow-clad Rupin Pass. It brought me to Sangla in Kinnaur, a place I had never been to before. Years ago, Kinnaur was called Chini tahsil.        
	Later, while reading Ramachandra Guhas book India after Gandhi, I learnt that a group of Buddhists in Chini tahsil, who wished to cast their vote ahead of the winter snows, had been the first people to vote in an Indian general election. They did so on October 25, 1951; then waited long for the rest of the country to vote and the results to be announced.

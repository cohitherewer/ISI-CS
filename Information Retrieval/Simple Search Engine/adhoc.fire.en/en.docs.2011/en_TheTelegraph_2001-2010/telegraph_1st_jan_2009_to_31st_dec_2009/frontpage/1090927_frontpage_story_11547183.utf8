	Prague, Sept. 26 (AP): President Barack Obama had his fly. Now Pope Benedict XVI has his spider.        
	A large arachnid appeared on the popes white robes as he addressed politicians and diplomats in Prague this afternoon. The pope did not seem to notice at first  but journalists following the speech on a large screen flinched as the spider inched toward Benedicts neck.        
	 It disappeared from view for a moment, but then could be seen crawling up the right side of the 82-year-old pontiffs face.         
	When it reached his ear, Benedict gave it a swat. But it didnt go away  it reappeared on the popes left shoulder and scampered down his robe. As the pope left the medieval Prague Castles ornate Spanish Hall, the spider could be seen hanging from a piece of web.        
	In June, Obama now famously swatted and killed a fly that intruded on an interview for CNBC at the White House.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Safety call to Knight fans
                                                                                                           Safety call to Knight fans
  - Turn up only if convinced of security: SRK          PRATIM D. GUPTA                            Shah Rukh Khan and Priyanka Chopra at the shoot of the cheerleader hunt on Thursday. Picture by Gajanan Dudhalkar                                        
	Mumbai, March 5: Shah Rukh Khan has a message for Knight Riders supporters: come to the grounds only if you feel safe.         
	I appeal to all spectators at Eden Gardens, even if it means my business getting hit, to come and watch the matches only if they are sure about the security arrangements, the KKR co-owner said.        
	The terror attack on the Sri Lankan team in Lahore has cast a cloud on the Indian Premier League, but Shah Rukh said: I feel bad for the players but you cant stop life because of this. For the common man on the street, who needs to go out and work for his daily bread, he cannot think of stopping his daily activities because of terrorism.        
	Still, like I had said during the release of my film Rab Ne Bana Di Jodi after 26/11, that only watch the film if you are going out to the theatres, Shah Rukh is asking the crowds to come to the Eden only if they feel secure.        
	If the IPL kicks off on schedule  a big question mark hangs over it after the Centre suggested the matches should be postponed  Shah Rukh will be out in the grounds on his now-familiar role as the KKR twelfth man.        
	Is baar baaki teams ke liye mera ek haath hi kaafi hai! he joked, playing Thakur of Sholay with his left arm in a sling after a shoulder surgery two weeks ago.        
	I will be there and I will clap with both hands I just hope they give me reason enough to clap, Shah Rukh told The Telegraph this afternoon, on way from Mannat to the Yash Raj Studio for his first shoot after the surgery.         
	In the last season, his team had failed to make it to the final four. That hurt  Losing is depressing, he says  but Shah Rukh hopes to teach the boys a lesson he has learnt in his nearly 20 years in Bollywood: Its not about the knockout punch, its about lasting the 12 rounds.        
	When I started off I was like Mike Tyson, but now I have realised that you have to be either Muhammad Ali or George Foreman. As (boxer) Jake LaMotta said, you cant take me down. You can lose but dont be a loser. I have had more failures than successes in my career but today people call Shah Rukh Khan a success because I could take all the beatings. I want to instil this feeling in all the Knight Rider kids, he said.        
	If all the pep talk doesnt work, SRK has another strategy up his sleeve. I plan to get hold of a huge black bell this time which I want to play during the matches at Eden Gardens. It will go dong dong like those huge gongs. When I see the festival of Durga Puja and all the bells everywhere, I want to bring that flavour to the field. You may think I am an outsider but I am not an outsider in Calcutta. I had the option of Jaipur and Delhi but I always wanted Calcutta as my IPL team.         
	He hoped the remixed team anthem would be even more popular than Korbo Lorbo Jeetbo Re was in the inaugural season.         
	But he wont be in the Club House stand this time, egging on the Calcutta crowd. I just have to ask the powers-that-be to allow me to sit near the boundary because I dont think I will be able to sit with the crowds, he said. Out of love, a lot of people might pull my hand and that can hurt.         
	His first shoot after the surgery was for KKR  to crown the six lucky girls whove won the cheerleader hunt on TV, Knights amp; Angels. Its a brand building exercise for the team because it is only through shows like this that I can tell the rest of the country about the Knight Riders. They wouldnt react to a Kolkata Knight Riders billboard but shows like this will make our team a household name across the country.        
	SRKs most special get well message also has a Calcutta connection.         
	The main criterion for our team to win is full fitness and I am messaging the main player of the team to get fit soon, reads the SMS from Jagmohan Dalmiya, the man in charge at Eden.

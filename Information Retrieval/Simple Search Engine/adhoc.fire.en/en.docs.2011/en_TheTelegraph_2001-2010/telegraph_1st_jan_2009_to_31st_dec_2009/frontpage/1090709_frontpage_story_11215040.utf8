                                                                                                           Nanny days gift a tax legacy
          JAYANTA ROY CHOWDHURY                              
	New Delhi, July 8: The return of the gift tax in this years budget has left tax analysts wondering whether people have become more generous or whether it is another example of the immortality of nanny-economy habits.        
	According to the budget, the fair market value of gifts of property worth more than Rs 50,000, made after October 1, 2009, by non-relatives, will be added to a persons taxable income. Property has been defined to mean not only land and buildings, but also shares and securities, jewellery, paintings, sculpture, archaeological collections or any other work of art.        
	Only gifts received from relatives or on weddings or by way of inheritance or from local authorities, foundations, universities and trusts will be exempt.        
	The levy completes the phased resurrection of the gift tax that was abolished in 1998. Eleven years ago, the then finance minister, Yashwant Sinha, had buried the tax by pointing out that it generated little money and a high degree of confusion in valuation that often led to litigation.        
	However, in 2004, P. Chidambaram partly revived the levy, taxing gifts of money exceeding Rs 25,000 from non-relatives. After protests, the government raised the floor to Rs 50,000, leaving out non-monetary gifts.         
	Referring to the latest widening of the net, Ved Jain, former president of the Institute of Chartered Accountants, said: In a way, this is bringing back the old gift tax... but it is penalising the receiver. The government could be trying to tax income which has not been earned.         
	He pointed out that the threat of litigation had not minimised. If a person gifts a painting which he considers to be worth Rs 2 lakh, but a government official feels its fair market value is Rs 5 lakh, there could be a conflict situation.        
	The Supreme Court had earlier ruled in various cases that personal gifts could not be taxed without proving that they were remuneration for services rendered. Lawyers said the new amendment invalidated such rulings.        
	What has changed now? Perhaps, the government thinks that people are exchanging more gifts now and it can raise more revenue. This looks more like a bureaucratic effort to wield control like the old days, said a tax analyst.        
	But finance ministry officials said they had come across many instances where acquisitions of jewellery and art were reported as gifts to escape paying tax.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Oprah decides to stop talking
                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                Oprah decides to stop talking
          BRIAN STELTER AND BILL CARTER                            Huge bet                                  
	New York, Nov. 20: Oprah Winfrey is giving network television one of her trademark aha moments.        
	Winfrey, the billionaire queen of daytime television, announced that she will step down from her daily pulpit, The Oprah Winfrey Show, in two years in order to concentrate on the forthcoming cable channel that will bear her name.        
	This show has been my life and I love it enough to know when its time to say goodbye. Twenty-five years feels right in my bones, and it feels right in my spirit. Its the perfect number, the exact right time, Winfrey said during todays show at her Chicago studio.        
	Winfrey, 55, did not divulge her future plans.        
	The list of repercussions of her decision is long. For CBS, the owner of syndication rights to her show, it means the loss of its signature programme and millions of dollars every year in revenue.        
	For ABC stations, where her show was largely seen, it means the loss of daytimes most popular programme, a generator of giant audiences leading into evening news programmes.        
	Larry Gerbrandt, an analyst for the firm Media Valuation Partners, said any show that ABC comes up with to replace her will not draw anything near the ratings guarantee they could count on Oprah. At least for the first year, ABC is going to take a serious hit.        
	More widely, her departure will surely be interpreted as an endorsement of the cable TV business, and a blow to the fortunes of broadcast television. Discovery Communications, which will co-own the new channel, announced the creation of OWN 20 months ago. Now Discovery will parlay Winfreys anticipated exit from broadcast into higher per-subscriber fees and will also seek more lucrative commitments from advertisers.        
	For Winfrey herself, the move represents an enormous bet  that her popularity and golden touch with programming can sustain an entire cable channel and that she will remain a central cultural figure even without the mass exposure of broadcast television every day.        
	Far and away the most popular daytime talk show host, Winfrey has spent two decades spinning her TV fame into a vast media empire, including her own show, a popular magazine, a book club and several movies.                     NEW YORK TIMES NEWS SERVICE

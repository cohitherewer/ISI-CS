The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Violence fig leaf for go-slow 
                                                                                                           Violence fig leaf for go-slow 
  - Govt to seek 3 months on ban        OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                                  
	Calcutta, Jan. 3: The Bengal government today signalled a go-slow on the enforcement of the auto ban, citing violence as an excuse to lay the ground for seeking a legal extension of the deadline by three months.        
	After todays violence, we are considering whether to go slow. We can stop our operations for one or two days if it brings results, home secretary Ardhendu Sen told reporters following talks with chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee.        
	The governments virtual admission of inability to implement the law brought a scathing query from a key petitioner in the auto pollution case. If the government cant maintain law and order said Subhas Dutta, let it give an undertaking that it cant stop illegal activities in any sphere of public life.         
	The Citu said it urged the government to go slow  words identical to that of the home secretary. The Citu claim and the government response raise questions whether the administration is lending primacy to the request of a Left union rather than the directive of the court which had less than a fortnight ago turned down a plea for an extension of the deadline.        
	The administration also referred to other procedural difficulties, none of which would have arisen had it stirred five months earlier when the high court issued the ban order. (See chart)        
	The government is expected to move a petition in the high court on Monday, asking it to extend the December 31 deadline by three months.        
	The chief minister confirmed the move to seek a new deadline, saying auto drivers cannot be asked to change (to LPG) one fine morning  although the court order had come on July 18. We have to keep the concerns of auto drivers in mind, Bhattacharjee told a party rally.        
	A team from CPM labour arm Citu, thrown on a sticky wicket by the controversy, met Sen and junior labour minister Anadi Sahoo today. We urged the home secretary to go slow. Over 14,000 autos have applied for conversion to LPG and they need time, Citus Subhas Mukherjee said.        
	Well cite the violence to ask the court for more time, said the governments junior standing counsel, Subrata Mukhopadhyay. The government will mention the lack of LPG outlets too, and argue that the wheels will fall off Calcuttas public transport if 80 per cent autos go off the streets together, he said.        
	However, when the high court had ruled out a deadline extension on December 23, advocate-general Balai Ray did not raise any of these objections, Dutta said. And when the court-appointed committee (for implementation), chaired by the chief secretary, met on December 26, it reiterated that the December 31 deadline would be met.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Glare on track wear and tear
                                                                                                           Glare on track wear and tear
          OUR BUREAU                                              
	Feb. 14: Wear and tear of track, and a possible technical snag, could have caused the Coromandel Express to derail, killing nine passengers.        
	Basudev Acharya, chairman of the parliamentary standing committee on railways, said from the accident site: I am told by senior railway officials that track renewal was overdue and that appears to be the possible reason for the derailment.        
	The Coromandel derailed in Orissa on a line used extensively to carry iron ore to port cities, causing wear and tear.         
	The railways, for short-term gain, had allowed increased capacity loading in goods wagons, which has adversely affected the condition of the tracks. We had in our report to Parliament asked the government to constitute a task force to study the impact of the excess load on the track, but no action has been taken, Acharya said.        
	Lalu Prasad, the railway minister, in his budget speech yesterday bragged about the financial turnaround he had achieved and the growth in freight that contributed to it.         
	Railway sources agreed that freight and passenger trains were increased without significant track renewal.        
	A sweet stall owner near the accident site, P. Sahu, said: Two months ago, a goods train jumped rails at the same place.         
	Junior railway minister R. Velu, who visited the site, said it was unlikely the driver was at fault. It is difficult to guess the exact cause.... However, it seems unlikely to be human error. The man has enough experience of driving on just this one track, he said. The driver had been driving the Coromandel for a year and a half, sources said.        
	The Commissioner of Railway Safety will submit a report in seven days, Velu added.        
	Technical error appears to be a more plausible reason for the derailment, a senior railway official said.        
	Driver Ucchab Jani, who is in hospital, said he had spied a fire at the rear of the engine van. I was scared and slammed the brakes. The coaches behind the engine derailed one after the other and rammed into each other, he said.         
	Assistant driver K. Medak did not see a fire. I felt heavy vibration in the engine and then fell unconscious, he said.         
	The railways said nine people had died, not 16 as thought earlier. Six have been identified: A.K. Sinha, 45, Pawan Pillai, 48, Om Prakash Bhalotia, 65, Lakshminarayan Manna, 66, Atanu Dutta, 27, and Sabir Mondal, 38.         
	Sixty-two were injured.

  - Obama convinces Islamabad Taliban pose mortal threat        K.P.NAYAR                             Obama at the news conference. (AFP)                                        
	Washington, April 30: One hundred days after taking office, US President Barack Obamas administration has finally convinced Pakistan that the mortal threat to that country does not come from India, but from a resurgent Taliban and al Qaida.        
	Obama used a prime-time, nationally televised news conference last night to celebrate the 100-day milestone of his presidency to make a landmark announcement that you are starting to see some recognition (in Islamabad) just in the last few days that the obsession with India as the mortal threat to Pakistan has been misguided, and that their biggest threat right now comes internally.        
	True to his reputation as no drama Obama, the President did not make any tall claims  unlike many previous US administrations  of having played a direct role in influencing decision-making in Pakistan or India.        
	But The New York Times was reporting, even as Obama was preparing to mark his 100 days in office, that Pakistan had agreed to move 6,000 troops from its Indian border to fight militants on its western border with Afghanistan.        
	Obama indicated that Pakistans nuclear weapons were under US control: or at least that they were under the control of sections of the Pakistani security establishment in which Washington had absolute trust.        
	This, though, could only be read between the lines of what Obama said at the news conference. I am confident that we can make sure that Pakistans nuclear arsenal is secure, in the event that it became a failed state and the writ of militants continued to run across more areas of Pakistan.        
	There have been persistent reports  never officially confirmed  during the Bush administration that the Americans had taken control of Pakistans nuclear arsenal because of worries over religious infiltration of that countrys military and its security establishment.        
	Last night, it was clear from Obamas replies to questions about Pakistans atom bombs falling into Taliban or al Qaida hands that he was not losing any sleep over the issue.        
	We have huge strategic interests, huge national security interests in making sure that Pakistan is stable and that you dont end up having a nuclear-armed militant state, the President assured Americans worried over the recent militant takeover of Buner near Islamabad.        
	I am more concerned that the civilian government there right now is very fragile and doesnt seem to have the capacity to deliver basic services, Obama said about his administrations priorities in Islamabad.        
	Sources in New Delhi familiar with border deployments said the 6,000 troops that Pakistan had now offered to move away from the Indian border had been deployed there from the Pakistan-Afghanistan border following the terrorist attack in Mumbai in November 2008.        
	The Pakistani move, therefore, represents a return to the status quo as it existed before December last year.        
	Many insiders in the Obama administration, however, worry that the promised troop redeployment may be yet another gimmick by Pakistan to take away the heat it is getting from the White House on its handling of domestic militancy, a tactic that General Pervez Musharraf perfected under the Bush administration.        
	Pakistan President Asif Ali Zardari and Afghanistan President Hamid Karzai have been summoned to the White House on May 6 and 7 to discuss the critical situation that is developing in their countries.        
	Zardari would have been hauled over the coals by Obama at the trilateral summit if he had come here without some gestures on fighting militancy, such as troop redeployment on Pakistans twin borders with India and Afghanistan.

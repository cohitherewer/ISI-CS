          RADHIKA RAMASESHAN                            Mukherjee                                  
	New Delhi, Jan. 23: Pranab Mukherjee will stand in for Manmohan Singh till the Prime Minister recovers, fulfilling designated as well as unstated duties and responsibilities.        
	The new task will be in addition to Mukherjees current roles as foreign minister, the leader of the Lok Sabha, the president of the Bengal Congress and the head of over 30 groups of ministers.        
	It has always been a tradition that when the Prime Minister is away, the CCPA (cabinet committee on political affairs) takes key political decisions. Whoever is the seniormost minister officiates on his (the Prime Ministers) behalf and that is me, Mukherjee said.        
	Among the last orders signed by the Prime Minister before he left home at 1.30pm for the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) was to unbundle finance ministership on Mukherjee.         
	However, Mukherjee has not been placed fully in the saddle. A communiqu issued by the Presidents office said Mukherjee would hold the additional charge of the finance ministry until the recovery of the Prime Minister from medical treatment.        
	Sources said Mukherjee would not be referred to as officiating or working Prime Minister as the Constitution doesnt provide for such a post. He will continue to function from his official chamber in South Block. It is not clear if officials in the Prime Ministers Office (PMO) will report to Mukherjee. The internal arrangements are being worked out, an official said.        
	Some of the responsibilities of the Prime Minister have been handed over to Prithviraj Chavan, the deputy minister in the PMO.        
	The other three portfolios Singh holds  coal, information and broadcasting and environment and forest  have not gone to Mukherjee. It is learnt that the Prime Minister has asked the deputy ministers to sign papers.        
	Asked who will hold the nuclear command  the Prime Minister heads the nuclear command authority  sources said it would be Mukherjee.        
	As in the past when the Prime Minister was away, Mukherjee will preside over cabinet meetings.         
	Sources said Singh emphasised that the Thursday cabinet sittings should be unfailingly held.        
	Asked whether the wording of the communiqu meant Singh would get back finance once he returned, sources said given the Prime Ministers eagerness to find a replacement, it was unlikely he would retain the portfolio.        
	Barring the impending announcement of a rollback in fuel prices, Mukherjees only big finance assignment will be to oversee the vote-on-account in Parliament. Much of the work has already been done.         
	In other words, Mukherjee is expected to do a holding operation in the finance ministry.

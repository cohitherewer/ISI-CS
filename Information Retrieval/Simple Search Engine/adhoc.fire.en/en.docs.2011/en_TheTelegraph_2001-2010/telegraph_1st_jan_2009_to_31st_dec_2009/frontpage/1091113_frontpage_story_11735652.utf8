          OUR BUREAU                              
	Calcutta, Nov. 12: The Bengal government has invited Bharat Heavy Electricals Ltd (Bhel) to set up a power equipment factory and suggested as a possible site the land leased out to Tata Motors in Singur.        
	The government also plans to set up a power plant jointly with the public sector Navratna company in Katwa, Burdwan, where land acquisition has run into trouble from farmers.        
	A Bhel team, led by general manager S.C. Mittal, today visited the Singur site, about 40km from Calcutta and originally meant for the Tata Nano. Mittal was accompanied by Debashis Sen, managing-director of the state power development corporation.        
	Power minister Mrinal Banerjee said Bhel, which specialises in manufacturing boilers and turbo-generators, had no equipment manufacturing plant in the region. We took them to Singur today for a look at the site, he said, stressing that it happened to be one of the areas being considered.        
	Banerjee said the government had proposed setting up a 1,600MW power plant jointly with the public sector company. We want to set up two 800MW units and we came to know that Bhel is eager to participate in power generation.        
	Talks were on with Bhel regarding both, the minister said, but no decision had been taken yet. Bhel has neither rejected nor accepted our proposal, he added. The Bhel officials will return to Delhi, have a discussion among themselves and get back to us.        
	Banerjee said Bhel could set up the equipment factory in Singur if they like the place. But for setting up a power plant, we think Katwa would be ideal.        
	Mamata Banerjee, whose agitation forced the Tatas to shift the Nano project from the nearly 1,000-acre site, made her stand clear this evening. The (Bhel) factory can come up on 600 acres but 400 acres have to be returned to farmers from whom land was taken forcibly, she told STAR Ananda from Delhi.        
	It is not clear how much land Bhel will need for the factory. An NTPC-Bhel power equipment plant is coming up in Andhra Pradesh on 750 acres.         
	The southern project, estimated to cost Rs 6,000 crore, is expected to create 6,000 direct jobs and 25,000 indirect opportunities. Factories making power equipment are usually more employment-intensive than power generation plants.        
	Describing the state governments drive as a gimmick and an eyewash, Mamata said Bhel wanted to set up two power plants with the railways, too.        
	The Singur land is still in the possession of Tata Motors and its vendors. A Tata Motors spokesperson said the company would discuss the matter with the government. The lease is due for renewal in April.

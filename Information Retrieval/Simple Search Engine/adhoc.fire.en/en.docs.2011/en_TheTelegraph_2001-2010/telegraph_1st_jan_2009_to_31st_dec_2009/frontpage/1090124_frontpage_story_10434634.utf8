          CHARU SUDAN KASTURI                              
	New Delhi, Jan. 23: Participate in national sports events while in school, and appear for examinations despite missing four in every 10 classes.        
	The countrys largest school education board has re- laxed attendance norms for students who participate in national sports events to help potential champion sportspersons focus on their game.        
	The Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) has amended its examination bye-laws to grant students participating in sports events organised by national bodies leeway in attendance for the first time, The Telegraph has learnt.        
	So far, all students from standard IX onwards required 75 per cent attendance to appear for their school or board examinations, at the end of standard 10 and 12.        
	The amendments, notified on January 2, allow the best among the countrys young sportspersons to appear for the exams even with 60 per cent attendance.        
	School cricketers picked to represent their state in Ranji Trophy, for instance, will need to attend fewer classes than others. The amendment, added as a new rule in the bye-laws, includes subjects involving laboratory practicals. Youngsters who show talent in a particular sport are jewels who may go on to win medals in the Olympics or other similar honours for the country. They need to be encouraged, a senior government official said.         
	The CBSE has noticed a number of cases of budding sportsmen failing to meet the attendance criteria to appear for examinations, especially the boards, over the past few years, the official said.        
	The 75 per cent attendance requirement deterred many such children from travelling out of their city to take part in national competitions. We were penalising emerging sportsmen and sportswomen for dreaming to represent India and participate in major events. This had to change, the official said.         
	The amendments will affect the attendance requirements of students appearing for the 2009 board examinations in March. Over 10,000 schools in India and abroad  mostly in Indian missions  are affiliated to the CBSE.         
	In India, we do not have the dedicated sports schools that China does. If we have to compete with our neighbour in sports, we need to encourage children within the formal schooling system, a CBSE source said. India has traditionally lagged China in most sporting disciplines common to both countries.         
	The CBSE amendment also broadens exemptions from exams in a third language  over and above English and Hindi  available only to spastic, blind, handicapped and dyslexic children. The new rule extends the exemption to all children with disabilities included in the Persons with Disabilities Act of 1995.         
	Autistic children, for instance, will now be exempt from appearing for a third language examination.

	June 1: An Air France plane with 228 people aboard disappeared over the Atlantic today, raising the spectre of the worst crash in the airlines history and troubling countless passengers with the question whether commonplace lightning was to blame.        
	The Airbus A330-200 was presumed to have crashed into the Atlantic Ocean after hitting heavy turbulence  possibly a towering wall of thunderstorms  during a flight from Brazils Rio de Janeiro to Paris.        
	The airline offered its condolences to the families of the passengers, making clear it did not expect to find survivors. At least 60 of those on board were French, roughly 60 were Brazilians and two were Slovaks, their countries said. It was not clear if any Indian was on board.        
	The most likely thing is that the plane was hit by lightning. The plane was in a stormy area with strong turbulence, which provoked problems, said Franois Brouse, Air Frances director of communications.         
	But aviation experts said lightning strikes on planes were common and expressed doubt that a bolt was enough to bring the plane down. An expert said planes have specific measures built in to help dissipate electricity along the aircrafts skin.        
	An Air France spokesperson later said that probably, a combination of circumstances could have led to the crash.        
	Flight AF447, with 216 passengers, including seven children and one baby, as well as 12 crew members, took off from Rio de Janeiro at 7.03pm local time yesterday for Charles de Gaulle airport in Paris, where it was due at 11.15am today (9.15GMT).         
	Air traffic controllers had their last contact with the aircraft about four hours into the flight, when the pilot said that he had hit severe turbulence. Fifteen minutes later, seven hours before it was due in Paris, the aircrafts systems sent an automatic error message reporting multiple electrical faults, and lost cabin pressure.         
	The combination of the two implied that the Airbus A330-200  a plane with an excellent safety record  might have simply broken up in the storm.        
	Tropical thunderstorms... can tower up to 50,000 feet. At the altitude it was flying, its possible that the Air France plane flew directly into the most charged part of the storm  the top, Henry Margusity, senior meteorologist for AccuWeather.com, said in a statement.        
	Experts said the absence of a mayday call meant something happened very quickly. The conclusion to be drawn is that something catastro-phic happened on board that has caused this airplane to ditch in a controlled or an uncontrolled fashion, Janes Aviation analyst Chris Yates said. Potentially, it went down very quickly and so quickly that the pilot on board didnt have a chance to make that emergency call.        
	Airport officials in Paris reported initially that the airliner had dropped off radar screens at 0600GMT, somewhere between the Azores and the coast of North Africa. In fact, it appears to have come down closer to Brazil, although a search and rescue mission sent out from the Brazilian archipelago of Fernando de Noronha has found no trace of it.        
	Experts said the plane should be found because it had backup locators that should continue to function even in deep water.        
	In Washington, a Pentagon official said hed seen no indication that terrorism or foul play was involved.                     WITH INPUTS FROM THE TIMES, LONDON

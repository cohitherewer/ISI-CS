	Calcutta, March 26: M, the constant consonant in Bengal politics, is getting a makeover.        
	Mausam Noor, an MLA from the Ghani Khan Chowdhury family, has been named the Congress candidate for the Malda North Lok Sabha seat.        
	At 28, Mausam is not only the youngest candidate representing the mainstream parties in this election in the state but also the symbol of rising woman power in Bengal politics.        
	This M has a witty streak  an element not always found in the other Ms such as Mamata and the dyed-in-the-wool Marxist. Mausam also loves swimming, can play tennis and be an associate in a reputable law firm.        
	Mausams entry into the fray, apparently necessitated by uncertainty surrounding the citizenship of her uncle, means that this time, Bengal can send at least five ladies to the Lok Sabha.         
	Other than Mausam, Mamata, Kakali Ghosh Dastidar, Deepa Das Munshi and either Susmita Bauri or Seuli Saha (both are facing off in Bishnupur) stand a good chance of making it to the Lower House. If Jyotirmoyee Sikdar, who is locked in a close contest, and Satabdi Roy, who is facing a tough fight, pull off surprises, the highest number of women from Bengal in recent memory will be going to the Lok Sabha.        
	Even the frontrunner five is not a mean number, though it is not a record. In 1998 and 1999, Bengal had five women MPs.        
	The difference this time is that the number of total candidates has gone down but that of winnable nominees has gone up. If eleven women candidates ran in 1998 and 10 in 1999, only nine from the mainstream parties are in the race now  which means against a success percentage of 45 per cent and 50 per cent in the previous years, this year the probable pass percentage is already higher at 55.5 per cent.        
	Unforeseen circumstances  such as the illness of Priya Ranjan Das Munshi and the land-fuelled surge of Trinamul  have contributed to the bright prospects of some candidates. But some of the ladies are achievers in their own right and can boast a resume that not many of their male peers in politics can match.         
	Mausam is the best example of the new breed. A lawyer and La Martiniere alumnus, the niece of the late A.B.A Ghani Khan Chowdhury exuded confidence as she spoke to The Telegraph at her Beckbagan home on her candidature.        
	Of course I am excited. Why shouldnt I be? This is a great opportunity for me to serve my people, she said, referring to her candidature.        
	A few hours ago, she had met Pranab Mukherjee to sort out some formalities and take his blessings to embark on her campaign.        
	K. Keshava Rao had asked me to meet Pranab babu so I went over to his place this afternoon. We sorted out some formalities regarding my candidature. He gave me his blessings and said that I should now leap heart and soul into winning the seat, said a beaming Mausam who has already cut her teeth in elections.        
	She is the sitting MLA from Sujapur in Malda and had won the seat after the death of her mother Rubi Noor. By defeating rival Haji Ketabuddin of the CPM by 21,000 votes, Mausam surpassed the victory margin of her mother in the 2004 Assembly elections by over 4,000 votes.        
	Asked about her maternal uncle Abu Naser Khan Chowdhury, Mausam said: I do feel very bad for what Lebu mama had to go through. But the announcement of candidature for the seat was getting delayed and the AICC had to take a call. It was decided yesterday that I would be contesting for the seat. Sonia madam has picked me.        
	Abu Naser is cut up with the high command but made it clear that Mausam should be left out of the controversy over the denial of ticket to him. Please leave Mausam out of this. The whole of Malda will campaign for her, he said.        
	Asked if her bid to step into the national arena will inspire the younger generation to join the political process, she said: I certainly hope so. In whatever way, I would like to set an example. My generation is the future of this country and the importance of young people coming into politics cannot be overemphasised.        
	Certain parallels can be drawn between another young politician Mahua Moitra, a finance professional who gave up her job abroad and joined the Congress, and Mausam.         
	Mahua was a frontrunner for Krishnagar but it slipped out of her hand after last-minute differences between the Congress and Trinamul.        
	If Mahua was with JP Morgan, a financial services firm, Mausam is associated with the Delhi office of the law firm, Fox and Mandal.        
	Mausams Orkut profile describes her as ambitious, fun loving, witty and adventurous. She also plays tennis and loves to swim. One entry suggests Mausam is well-fortified for life in politics: she is a fan of all horror films.

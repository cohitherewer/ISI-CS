  - Coach had no role: Confidant          LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI                              Gary Kirsten, Paddy Upton				                                       
	Johannesburg, Sept. 24: From being a rather reticent coach who is happy staying in the background, Gary Kirsten is today being projected as a sex guru.        
	Kirsten doesnt see that as a feather in his cap. Rather, hes very upset at being portrayed as the co-author of a document with steamy contents, for he had absolutely no role in its compilation and distribution.         
	According to a well-placed source, the entire exercise was done exclusively by mental conditioning expert Paddy Upton, who joined the Team India support staff on fellow-South African Kirstens recommendation.        
	Gary didnt script even one line of what was given to the players some months ago. Upton did the authoring, after going through scientific studies. Its absurd to claim that Gary is all for sex before a match, said a Kirsten confidant, who didnt wish to be identified.        
	Speaking this afternoon, the confidant added: Actually, its ludicrous to suggest that having sex before matches is part of Gary or Uptons strategy. The document was intended to be a medium of communication and information and, so, should be seen that way only.        
	Some things have been put in a light-hearted manner so that every player understands what is being communicated. A benign document has been projected as one advocating sex. Thats just not done.        
	The confidant went to the extent of saying: Please ask any player if, at any time, Gary has even remotely talked about sex and linked it to on-field performances. Thats not Gary. It would, indeed, be against his beliefs to speak in that manner.        
	Kirsten, for his part, declined to take questions. He neither spoke at the elite Old Edwardians Sports Club, where the team had an extended session in the morning, nor at the glitzy Sandton Sun hotel.        
	Footnote: The joke doing the rounds here is whether the Indian cricketers actually need to be told to engage in an activity which could boost their showing on the field. The playboys, especially, dont need any advice, quipped somebody who knows them well.

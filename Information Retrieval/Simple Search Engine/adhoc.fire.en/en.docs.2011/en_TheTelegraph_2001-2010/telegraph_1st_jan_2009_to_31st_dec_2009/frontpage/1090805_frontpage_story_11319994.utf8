                                Pitt and Jolie                            
	London, Aug. 4 (PTI): Hollywoods power couple Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie gave gourmet cuisine a miss on a weekend family outing, choosing instead to gorge on burgers from the omnipresent fast food chain Mc Donalds.        
	 The couple, better known as Brangelina, packed up their six children in the car for a trip to the famous restaurant, taking away their popular Happy Meal, reports the Daily Mail .        
	After a trip to Warner Bros studios in Los Angeles, the family of eight made a stop at the nearest McDonalds. The couple, who have been dogged by rumours of a split over the past few months, looked happy as they ordered for their large brood, Maddox, 7, Pax, 5, Zahara, 4, Shiloh, 3, and twins Knox and Vivienne, 1.         
	It was the couples first appearance in public together since the rumours. Pitt was supposed to have moved into a two-bedroom house separate from the rented family home he was sharing with Jolie and their children.

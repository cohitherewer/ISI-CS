The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Maoists raise Lalgarh armed force
                                                                                                           Maoists raise Lalgarh armed force
          PRONAB MONDAL                                              
	April 4: Maoists are converging in Lalgarh and stockpiling weapons brought from Jharkhand, threatening a bloodbath if security forces try to break a five-month blockade of police and enter during the elections.        
	But the state government says it is determined to send the police at any cost  possibly within seven days  into the West Midnapore trouble spot where guerrillas are training local youths in the use of automatic, semi-automatic and small firearms.         
	If it leads to a confrontation, what can we do? home secretary Ardhendu Sen said in Calcutta today. If the police are not there, who will ensure the safety of polling staff? ( )        
	Shekhar  the CPI (Maoist) leader in charge of Bengal, Jharkhand and Orissa  has an answer to that: Let the blood flow; Lalgarh is ours.        
	The arms and the cadres have arrived and the boys have been trained. Now let the police try to enter; well match them bullet for bullet, the 50-year-old, now supervising Operation Lalgarh, said in a village near Gopiballavpur, West Midnapore.        
	Most of his cadres have arrived from other strongholds in the district  such as Banspahari, Chakadoba and Belpahari  but some have come from neighbouring Jharkhand too.        
	They have set up 24x7 check-posts at Lalgarhs two entry points, Barapelia and Ramgarh, and stockpiled arms in a hut near each check-post. A peep into the hut at Barapelia revealed half-a-dozen rifles lined up against the wall.        
	The Maoists have been training us to use the guns in the Piyakata forest for the past few months. Lots of arms are coming in, too. All we have to do is distribute them among all those who have received the training, said Subhas Mahato, 22, of Khasjangal.         
	Lalgarhs tribals had dug up roads to keep the police out after the forces excesses following the November 2 mine blast on chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjees route.        
	The police allegedly raided homes night after night, beating up women and making indiscriminate arrests. The Telegraph has reported how three schoolboys, aged 14 and 15, were detained and tortured the night after the November 2 blast.         
	Chhatradhar Mahato, the leader of the Committee Against Police Atrocities, said Lalgarhs people wanted the election  scheduled on April 30 at Jhargram seat under which the area falls  because they were determined to vote against the CPM. But if the police entered forcibly, they would boycott the polling.        
	A Maoist from Belpahari who has been camping in Lalgarh said the villagers would form a three-tier human shield. The first tier will have women and children, the second will have people with bows and arrows, and the third will have those carrying guns.        
	A local tribal, Anil Mahato, said the villagers had made many copies of a map of Lalgarh. It shows even the jungle routes, which too we are guarding apart from the two main entry points where we have the check-posts.        
	A dozen people man each check-post by day; some 30 to 40 do so at night. The police might try to sneak in at night, said Adhin Mahato at the Barapelia check-post, about 5km from Lalgarh police station.        
	The inspector-general of police (western range), Kuldiep Singh, said: We have informed the Election Commission about the areas where we dont have access. We will act according to the commissions directive.        
	(Mondal reported from Lalgarh and an undisclosed location on the Bengal- Orissa border)

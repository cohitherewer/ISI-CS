The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Cops lose their cool, over AC 3-tier
                                                                                                           Cops lose their cool, over AC 3-tier
  - Police escorts want equal travel rights for undertrials          ANANYA SENGUPTA                                                    
	New Delhi, June 14: The cops are in a quandary, and all over an air con.        
	Delhi police, now given the right to travel in air-cooled comfort, have begun to perspire at the thought of stewing in the heat in general train compartments.        
	Their problem: what do they do while escorting bands of undertrials from a court in one city to that in another? Put them up in AC three-tier too? How do they reconcile their cooling rights to the rigours of their duty?        
	Unable to think up a solution, armed police guards have sent a proposal to the Delhi government requesting that undertrials on transit remand be allowed to travel AC three-tier too!        
	But there is a demon in the rules: although the sixth pay commission has granted cops the privilege, there is no equivalent right for prisoners.        
	According to the Delhi Prison (Transfer of Prisoners, Labour and Jail Industry, Food Clothing and Transportation) Rules, 1988, a prisoner who has to be shifted across cities in trains has to travel in ordinary/general class.        
	The Third Battalion of the Delhi Armed Police, tasked with escorting undertrials to and from courts in and outside the capital, are, however, unwilling to bend.        
	Its our right to travel in AC coaches. We are not asking for any special treatment. Why should we travel by sleeper class when we have the go-ahead to travel in AC? The government has to take a stand on this, an officer said.        
	We regularly travel with undertrials to present them before courts in other cities. There is no question of the police and the prisoners travelling in different coaches, so they have to be allowed to travel with us.        
	Depending on the type of prisoner, policemen of the rank of head constable or constable are assigned to travel with them. The sixth pay commission has recommended that officers above the rank of constable be entitled to air-conditioned travel.        
	Sources said Delhi government officials were not keen to push the proposal since it would entail unnecessary extravagance.        
	If we have to accommodate the cops request, we have to change the rules. It cant be done overnight. Many things have to be considered before we take a decision, a home department official said.        
	The government has, however, begun estimating how much the proposed change would cost the exchequer. On an average, three to four undertrials are taken to courts outside Delhi daily.        
	We already have people drawing up details of the extra expenses the government will incur. We dont want to take any hasty decision, the official said.        
	If the rules have to be changed, the lieutenant governor of Delhi would have to give the green signal. But his office had yet to receive word on the proposal, sources said.        
	Sunil Gupta, the law officer of Tihar jail, said the home department had sought prison authorities opinion but no decision had been taken.

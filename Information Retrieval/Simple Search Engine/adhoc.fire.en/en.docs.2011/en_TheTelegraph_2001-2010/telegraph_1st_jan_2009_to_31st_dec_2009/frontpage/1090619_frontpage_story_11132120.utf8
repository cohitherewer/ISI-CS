The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | UK envoy sees threat
                                                                                                           UK envoy sees threat
          A STAFF REPORTER                      British deputy high commissioner Simon Wilson in Calcutta                           
	Calcutta, June 18: Maoists will turn into a bigger threat for India if the authorities fail to act to control them now, outgoing British deputy high commissioner Simon Wilson said here today.        
	You (the government) actually dont know what they want. All such rebels always have a specific and clear agenda, but here the Maoists agenda is not clear, Wilson said on the sidelines of a programme organised by Bharat Chamber of Commerce here.         
	What the Maoists are doing is just anarchism against the democracy, the envoy to eastern India said.         
	Wilson, whose term ends next month, said Britain, too, had tackled rebels such as the Irish Republican Army. But they had a specific agenda and it was clear what they actually wanted, he said.

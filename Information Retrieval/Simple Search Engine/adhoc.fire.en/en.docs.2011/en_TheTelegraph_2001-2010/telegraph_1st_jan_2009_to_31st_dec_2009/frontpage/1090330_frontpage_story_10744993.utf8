The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Maya slaps Varun with long-jail law
                                                                                                           Maya slaps Varun with long-jail law
          OUR BUREAU                            Varun Gandhi                                  
	Lucknow/New Delhi, March 29: The Mayavati government tonight slapped the stringent National Security Act (NSA) on Varun Gandhi, which can keep him in jail up to a year but is unlikely to stand in the way of filing nomination papers.        
	The application of the law  meant for preventive detention of those considered a security risk  virtually renders meaningless the jailed politicians bail plea scheduled to come up in court tomorrow.        
	But even if the district court denies bail to Varun till April 24, the last date of filing nomination in Pilibhit, he can still file the papers to contest. He would need to apply for court permission for parole  which is usually given  to travel to the presiding officers chamber.        
	In the rare event of parole being denied, the Representation of the People Act allows a proposer to deliver signed nomination papers to the returning officer. The proposer will have to place an affidavit sworn by the candidate about the charges against him.         
	As of now, Varun has only been charged under several sections, not convicted. Conviction that carries a prison sentence of two years or above invites disqualification.        
	The BJP has so far ruled out a rethink in fielding Varun from Pilibhit, from where he delivered alleged hate speeches that have drawn a series of charges, including attempt to murder. The charges carry a maximum punishment of life imprisonment.        
	The use of the NSA has to be upheld within seven weeks by a committee of three persons qualified to be appointed judges of a high court. If the panel upholds the relevance of the NSA, Varun can be kept in jail up to a year.        
	The Uttar Pradesh administration cited three grounds to invoke the controversial act.        
	The Uttar Pradesh additional cabinet secretary, Vijay Shankar Pandey, told a late-night media conference that the reasons included two speeches delivered by Varun in Pilibhit and the riot yesterday while he was being taken to jail.         
	The three events have set off a wave of insecurity among minorities and are threatening to create a communal divide, Pandey added. The decision to invoke the act has been taken on the basis of the district administrations report as required by the law.        
	The application of the NSA can be revoked if the advisory committee finds the grounds to be vague, non-existent, not relevant or not connected with the person. The advisory committee will have to be set up within three weeks of invoking the law.

          PRIYA ABRAHAM                              
	Bhubaneswar, Feb. 6: Caste divide has reared its ugly head again in the state, this time in a Kendrapada school.         
	The Marityani Nodal School witnessed a controversy arising after a section of upper caste students and teachers opposed offerings being made by Dalit students to Saraswati.         
	The controversy, though shameful, is common enough in the country  however, Kendrapara administrations curious compromise in the issue has managed to raise some eyebrows.         
	To prevent further caste-related tiffs, the administration has directed the headmaster to not allow students to make offerings during any puja on school premises and perform the rituals himself.         
	The incident that took place on January 31 during Saraswati Puja began when the students, as usual, started to offer coconuts and fruits to the goddess as per norm.         
	However, some students opposed the Dalit students offering and even felt that they did not deserve the prashad.         
	The 50-odd Dalit students vehemently opposed the move and pressed for their freedom to worship  a fight that the parents joined in soon enough as the school administration stood watching.        
	As the fight intensified, Dalit students and their guardians lodged a complaint at the Rajnagar police station. Agitated guardians then petitioned to the district collector Sisirkanta Panda, who directed the Rajnagar BDO to inquire into the matter.        
	We were successful in convincing the students and the parents about the existing laws. Although they did not agree to let Dalit students worship the goddess, both parties arrived at a mutual agreement to not make any offerings.         
	From now on all pujas would be performed by the headmaster, Rabindra Nayak, and there will be no offerings from any of the students, said BDO, Narayan Nayak.        
	The group that had lodged an FIR has also withdrawn the case, he added.        
	However, the when in doubt, strike it out policy has left many feeling dissatisfied, especially after the BDOs statement that the agreement was good enough to prevent any further controversies  pointing out to a ostrich-like behaviour.         
	Its just shameful, said ruling BJD MP Mohan Jena. Untouchability in practised in any form is an offence and in educational institutions promoting it in any way is a greater sin. Those encouraging this must be immediately removed, said Jena, a prominent anti-caste movement leader. This is a retrograde step taken by the administration, said Rabindra Sethi, an activist of Ambedkar Lohia Vichar Manch. Despite legislation and policies, caste feelings still persist in the so-called civilised society, he said. The manch has decided to depute a fact-finding team to probe into the matter.

                                      (Frome top) DiCaprio, Diaz and Law: Love triangle                           
	London, July 21 (PTI): Actress Cameron Diaz seems to have no dearth of suitors since her split from British model Paul Schulfor as two of Holywoods hottest bachelors  Leonardo DiCaprio and Jude Law  are vying for her attention.        
	The Charlies Angels star, who is currently in the city, has been spotted partying at posh clubs with Law, who was her co-star in the romantic comedy, The Holiday, and the British hunk pulled out all the stops to charm Diaz.        
	Meanwhile, the actress has also been enjoying secret trysts with Leonardo DiCaprio who is in the city shooting for his next film.        
	Jude and Cameron have been good friends since they filmed The Holiday together a few years ago. Now they are both single, things are a bit different between them. Jude has been flirting with her and she has been playing along, said a source.        
	But the Alfie star faces tough competition from Titanic actor DiCaprio who has jokingly told friends that he and Diaz spend the nights playing chess. Leo is back on the pull after he split from his girlfriend Bar Rafaeli. Cameron has been showing a lot of interest while he is in London. She was back at his rented apartment in Knightsbridge a couple of times last week after a series of secret dates, said a source close to DiCaprio.

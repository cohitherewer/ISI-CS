          OUR BUREAU                                     
	Ranchi/Jamshedpur, Dec. 12: Voting in 14 Assembly constituencies in Maoist strongholds of Jharkhand passed off quietly and peacefully today with the deployment of over 40,000 security personnel and several hovering choppers ensuring an overall turnout of 58 per cent.        
	The penultimate phase of the month-long five-phased Assembly elections was the first real test of the elaborate security blanket that had been spread across the state, ahead of the fifth and final round of elections in Palamau, Chatra and West Singhbhum.         
	Today, senior police officials were unwilling to acknowledge their accomplishment till last group of central and state police forces were able to return to their camps from the poll battlefield.         
	Initial reports pointed to an overall turnout of 58.64 per cent, but poll officials said the figure could surpass the highest recorded so far  58.82 in the second phase  after the final reports from the interiors were collated.         
	The first and the third phase of polling recorded 53.10 and 57.21 per cent voting respectively.         
	As many as five constituencies, Ghatshila, Kolebira, Ichagarh, Lohardaga and Baharagora, registered voting percentages of 60 or more. Baharagora, the smallest constituency in terms of area, logged the highest poll percentage at 71, while Manoharpur recorded the lowest with 49.         
	Joint chief electoral officer Ashok Kumar Sinha said there was no report of any untoward incident from any of the 14 constituencies. Forty-three EVMs developed snags, of which 31 were replaced while 12 were rectified, he said.        
	Significantly, polling in Maoist-hit Potka constituency was watched by officials of the Election Commission via web cameras both in Ranchi and New Delhi. This was done for the first time on an experimental basis, Sinha said, adding that they would now be monitoring more booths via webcams during the final phase of elections on December 18.        
	As far as law and order issues go, there were reports of minor incidents from Ghatshila. Maoists indulged in air firing in Ghatshila (Maheshpur, booth no. 161) and Manoharpur (Bandgaon) just to make their presence felt, but the police chased them away. It had no impact on the polling process, said state police spokesperson V.H. Deshmukh.        
	Also, the police recovered a 40 kg bomb from Rania in Torpa constituency and a 5 kg bomb from a panchayat bhavan in Ghatshila.        
	Home secretary J.B. Tubid said the air surveillance of polling stations helped build confidence among voters. The turnout showed that people dont believe in Maoist ideology. What we have done is to provide adequate security so that they were able to vote, he said, maintaining it would be a fallacy to call the constituencies Maoist strongholds after such a good turnout.         
	 South Chhotanagpur DIG R.K. Mallick said the elections remained peaceful as poll personnel took all precautions prescribed in the rule book. Besides, Maoist dens had been under watch for long, he added.         
	A number of candidates from the Naxalite fold were contesting in the fourth phase. While jailed extremist Paulus Surin was in the fray from Torpa, Jiga Susaran Horo was contesting elections from Sisai, both on JMM tickets.        
	Sufal Oraon, fielded by Jharkhand Party, was also from the Maoist fold.

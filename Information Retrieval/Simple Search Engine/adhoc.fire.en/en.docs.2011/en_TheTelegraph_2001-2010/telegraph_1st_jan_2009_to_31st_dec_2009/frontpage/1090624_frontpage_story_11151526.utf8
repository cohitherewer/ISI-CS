	Calcutta, June 23: Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee today chose to act like chief minister, declaring that the Delhi ban against Maoists would apply to Bengal and paving the way for the arrest of a CPI (Maoist) spokesperson under a central law.        
	The central act banning the CPI (Maoist) will be applicable to all states across the nation, so Bengal cannot be an exception, Bhattacharjee said after a cabinet meeting.        
	The chief minister took care to address concerns among a section of his colleagues who objected to his stand at the cabinet meeting. But how and when and against whom this is applied will depend on the state government. Against this backdrop, the state government has no necessity to either enact a new law or frame new rules, Bhattacharjee said.        
	The assertion that there is no need for a state ban is in line with the stand of the CPM and the Left Front, both of which had yesterday underscored the futility of a ban.        
	The dual strategy  accepting the central decision but reserving the right to invoke it  was on display by the evening. Maoist spokesperson Gaur Chakraborty was arrested under the Unlawful Activities Prevention Act (UAPA), the law the Centre used yesterday to designate the Naxalite outfit a terrorist organisation.        
	Lalgarh police also recorded a complaint on their own against artistes like Aparna Sen and Kaushik Sen who had visited the area on Sunday. But the police made a distinction by filing only a general diary. If the police choose to, they can now file an FIR under Section 144 of the IPC, not the anti-terror law, against the artistes for flouting orders that prohibited the assembly of more than four persons.        
	The non-bailable central law carries a minimum punishment of five years in prison while Section 144 is bailable with a maximum punishment of a two-year term.        
	The police picked up the 73-year-old Chakraborty as he stepped out of a television studio in Park Circus. The arrest is being seen as the first sign of the Bengal governments complicity with the central decision on the Maoists without slapping a local ban, although Simi activists had been held earlier under the same law.        
	Since the Centre has outlawed the organisation and he is the spokesman for the CPI (Maoist), we detained him, Jawed Shamim, the deputy commissioner of the detective department, said. Chakraborty was handed over to the special branch, the city polices intelligence wing, and taken to an office on Lord Sinha Road for interrogation.        
	Tipped off that Chakraborty was visiting the office of a private TV channel, officers of the detective department waited for him to emerge and then detained him.         
	Chakraborty, who hails from Nadia, was in Lalgarh for the past couple of weeks and came to Calcutta two days ago. He was arrested in 2004 on the charge of waging war against the state and attacking policemen but was released two years later.        
	Compulsions of governance and the need to project a united front with the Centre in the fight against the Maoists  especially when central forces are engaging the rebels in Lalgarh and the state is banking on Delhi for more help  had prevented the chief minister from echoing his party and opposing the Delhi decision yesterday.        
	However, home secretary Ardhendu Sen had told The Telegraph last night itself that the central decision applied to all states  an administrative view the chief minister echoed today.        
	Sources in Delhi said Bhattacharjee was in touch with several politburo members who felt that there was no contradiction if the chief minister discharged his duty by implementing a Union government decision even if his party did not agree with it.

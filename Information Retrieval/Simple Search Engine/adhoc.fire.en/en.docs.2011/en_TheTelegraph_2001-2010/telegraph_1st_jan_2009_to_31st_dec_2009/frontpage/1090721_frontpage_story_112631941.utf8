	21 July: The city rsquo;s road communication was almost choked due to Trinamul Congress rsquo;s annual martyrs rsquo; day rally in Calcutta today. The rally was held to commemorate the death of 13 Youth Congress workers in police firing 16 years ago.   The meeting started at around 1 PM in front of Victoria House in Esplanade. Trinamul Congress chief Ms Mamata Banerjee and other leaders addressed the gathering from there.  By 10 in the morning the traffic was paralysed in most major roads including Mahatma Gandhi Road, Moulali, Park Street, Red Road, Lenin Sarani, C R Avenue, B B Ganguly Street and several other important roads, with people and vehicles who were converging to attend the meeting.   Approximately 5 lakhs people attended the meeting in the rainy afternoon in a radius of about one-kilometer around Esplanade.

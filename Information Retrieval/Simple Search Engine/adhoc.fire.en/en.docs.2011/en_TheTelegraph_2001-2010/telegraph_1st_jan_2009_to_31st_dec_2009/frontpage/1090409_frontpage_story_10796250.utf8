The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Mathur hunt for rehab package
                                                                                                           Mathur hunt for rehab package
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Guwahati, April 8: Assam Governor S.C. Mathur today said he was trying to work out a respectable package to bring the youths, who had chosen the path of violence, back to the mainstream.         
	Mathur said he had asked the government to provide him the details of the deal it had struck with surrendered Ulfa (Sulfa) cadres, to work out his conflict resolution formula. The governor proposed to study the Sulfa package to find its advantages and disadvantages before working out a new package.         
	He also sought opinions from a cross-section of the people to come out with a workable package to economically rehabilitate the misguided youths.         
	Mathur suggested that by creating avenues of livelihood for the youths, the terror problem could be addressed to a large extent. He also suggested that some of the youths who had taken up arms could be rehabilitated in the two battalions of the police to be raised by the government.         
	The governor was addressing a news conference at Raj Bhavan here.         
	Mathur said after working out the package he would take a personal initiative to get the funds for its implementation from the Centre. I can assure you funds will not be a constraint.         
	The governor also called for a greater public role in resolving the problem in the state. He said he would ask Dispur to hold a citizens meeting after the elections to chalk out a workable mechanism involving all sections of society, police and the government to deal with the situation.         
	Concerted efforts of all will be required to deal with the situation, the governor said, admitting there was a sense of vulnerability and insecurity among the people.         
	He, however, did not blame the government or the security agencies for the deteriorating law and order in the state.         
	He, in fact, took digs at the Opposition parties without naming them.         
	What did they do to improve the situation when they were in power? he asked.         
	The governor denied he had described the Maligaon blast as a small incident and claimed he was misrepresented. Mathur also did not agree to the contention that the situation in the state at present was not conducive for holding peaceful elections.         
	If elections can be conducted peacefully in Jammu and Kashmir after the Amarnath land dispute, why cant it be held here? he asked.         
	 Asked about the police failure to book the NC Hills Autonomous Council chief executive member, Mohit Hojai, for his alleged links with militants and two legislators who had assaulted Kaziranga National Park officials, Mathur said he had given requisite instructions to the authorities.

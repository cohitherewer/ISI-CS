          AJAY SUKUMARAN                            NDTV footage shows Yeddyurappa crying on television. (PTI)                                  
	Bangalore, Nov. 7: On the 11th day of the impasse in the Karnataka BJP, chief minister B.S. Yeddyurappa broke down.        
	Choking with emotion and tears welling up before TV cameras, the chief minister said he hadnt been able to defend the people who put their trust in him.        
	God will not forgive me for this, said Yeddyurappa, now in Delhi after being summoned by the BJP leadership.        
	All this on a day the Reddy brothers were back to square one, telling reporters in Bangalore that they hadnt given up their demand for a change of chief minister.        
	These events should not have happened at a time flood victims are suffering, Yeddyurappa told Suvarna News, a Kannada news channel, breaking down while answering a question about the governments flood-relief efforts.        
	My grief is that somewhere along the way I havent been able to take everybody along. I havent found the answer to that question yet.        
	While the BJP central leadership has maintained that the chief minister would stay in his post, Yeddyurappa is under pressure to sack Shobha Karandlaje, a confidante and the sole woman in his cabinet.        
	Yesterday, he had made his first move to appease the Reddys by transferring his principal secretary, V.P. Baligar, whose style of functioning the dissidents apparently resent.        
	He is terribly hurt, said a BJP member from Karnataka considered close to Yeddyurappa.        
	Some business-lobby people whose help we took are now holding the partys leaders to ransom. There has not been one word from the leaders that these were anti-party activities.        
	The BJP member added: You cant humiliate a chief minister by asking him to stay on for three days in Delhi for talks when he has work to do.        
	Yeddyurappa, however, reappeared before the TV cameras later in the day with a wan smile after a trip to the Vaishno Devi shrine in Jammu.        
	Im not going to comment on the political situation. The party leaders are discussing it, he told reporters.        
	A senior BJP leader quoted Yeddyurappa as saying he could not control his emotions in two situations  when he was very happy or deeply hurt.        
	Known to be short-tempered, Yeddyurappa had surprised the state Assembly in November 2007 by walking out of the House and resigning as chief minister barely a week after he had been sworn in. He was then to face a vote of confidence in the Assembly amid a souring relationship with coalition partner Janata Dal (Secular).        
	Riding on the sympathy factor because of the betrayal by the JD(S), Yeddyurappa had led the BJP to victory in the 2008 state polls. He was aided by the Reddy brothers Karunakar, Janardhan (who are now ministers) and Somashekar (an MLA).        
	Janardhan told reporters in Bangalore today that the chief minister was hampering the brothers functioning by transferring officials out of their strongholds Bellary and Gadag, in a message to bureaucrats not to co-operate with them.

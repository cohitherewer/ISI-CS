	Nagrakata, Feb. 5: Police today picked up four tribal youths in the restive Dooars in an apparent attempt to appear even-handed in the dispute with the Gorkha Janmukti Morcha but the crackdown triggered a flare-up that resulted in their eventual release.        
	Protesting the detentions, activists of a tribal outfit opposed to the Morcha ransacked a Jalpaiguri police station and indulged in rioting.        
	Over 5,000 Akhil Bharatiya Adivasi Vikas Parishad supporters smashed windowpanes and set vehicles on fire in the Nagrakata police station, 45km from Jalpaiguri town.        
	The police had to burst tear-gas shells and fire rubber bullets to disperse the mob, injuring four Parishad supporters and five policemen. No one was arrested.        
	The protesters were demanding the release of Bijay Lakra, 35, Ritesh Lakra, 32, Amarjit Baraik, 30, and Lalsai Gore, 30, picked up from Naya Saili garden this morning.         
	Police said they were picked up for damaging property but released them later.         
	The protesters suspect the four were picked up over recent clashes with the supporters of the Morcha, which has been trying to garner support for Gorkhaland in the region. The tribals oppose the statehood demand.        
	The earlier clashes had prompted the Morcha to launch an indefinite hunger strike, refusing to call it off after the chief minister yesterday denied permission to hold a rally in the region.         
	The Morcha has also called a 24-hour bandh in the region and in the hills on Saturday.        
	Todays arrests could have been intended as a signal from the government to the Morcha that it was not taking a partisan stand.        
	But the alleged manner in which the arrests were executed has touched a raw nerve. The police came like thieves at 2am to the houses of the four tea workers and took them away, Rajesh Lakra, the Parishad secretary of the Dooars-Terai area, said.        
	We had given the chief minister a list of Morcha supporters who had torched the houses of our members. We asked him to arrest them.         
	The chief minister assured us that no innocent person would be arrested. Now after this (todays arrests), we have called a bandh tomorrow, Lakra said.

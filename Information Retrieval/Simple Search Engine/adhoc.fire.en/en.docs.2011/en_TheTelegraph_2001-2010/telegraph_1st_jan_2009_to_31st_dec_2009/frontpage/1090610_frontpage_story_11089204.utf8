The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Singh reaches out to rivals
                                                                                                           Singh reaches out to rivals
  - PM sees new beginning          SANJAY K. JHA AND JAYANTH JACOB                            Singh, Advani                                       
	New Delhi, June 9: Pre-poll bitterness has given way to parliamentary bipartisanship, howsoever fleeting it may turn out to be.        
	Prime Minister Manmohan Singh today reached out across the aisle in Parliament, struck by an underlying sense of unity and declaring a new beginning in ties with the Opposition.        
	 Such phrases and gestures go hand in hand with the demeanour of the Prime Minister but they stood out today, probably because of the explosive duel between Singh and his principal opponent L.K. Advani in the middle of the general election.        
	The first step towards parliamentary reconciliation was taken a few days ago by Advani himself, whose reference to his rival as the weakest Prime Minister had ignited a series of testy repartees from Singh.        
	Today, responding to Advanis call on Friday for a new chapter in Opposition-government co-operation that would make the 21st century that of India, the Prime Minister revisited his favourite, but modified, Victor Hugo quote: This is an idea, I have been saying, whose time has come.        
	I consider it the duty of my government to build further unity of purpose. I have always felt that our differences will melt away when we consider the overwhelming nature of the challenge that our country faces, Singh said, wrapping up the motion of thanks to the Presidents address.        
	Advani was also in his favourite pose at the other end of the divide, listening intently with tilted head resting on his left palm.        
	The scenes today were markedly different from that of the first session of the previous Lok Sabha when the BJP had blasted the government and not allowed the Prime Minister basic courtesies such as introducing his ministers and replying to the Presidents address.        
	This time, magnanimous in victory, Singh made it a point to say there is no scope for bragging. He also stuck to the decorous standards of parliamentary democracy by congratulating Arun Jaitley for becoming the Leader of Opposition in the Rajya Sabha, referring to the BJP leader as a distinguished parliamentarian.        
	The BJP, too, responded with warmth, desisting from pressing amendments to the Presidents address  an oft-used device to voice dissent. I want to give them 100 days, a BJP leader said.        
	If anyone thought the Opposition was forgetting its principal role, the Left was around to discharge that responsibility. Brinda Karat, Sitaram Yechury and D. Raja moved a few amendments that were defeated by voice vote.        
	If the 15th Lok Sabha has started on a good note, it is because the election verdict has ensured a stable government.         
	The Opposition sees no hope of a new coalition emerging out of any realignment and hence would not want to create turmoil without reason.        
	But there are contentious issues that can strain what many see as an artificial consensus. On the womens reservation bill, deep-rooted differences are at play, voiced by Mulayam Singh Yadav and endorsed by Lalu Prasad.        
	The communal harmony bill could evoke similar reactions from the BJP.        
	Besides, Sushma Swaraj and Jaitley have to establish their leadership and cannot afford to be unobtrusive.Observers believe parties will be back to their disruptive ways sooner rather than later, but agree that some thorny issues have been removed from the political discourse.

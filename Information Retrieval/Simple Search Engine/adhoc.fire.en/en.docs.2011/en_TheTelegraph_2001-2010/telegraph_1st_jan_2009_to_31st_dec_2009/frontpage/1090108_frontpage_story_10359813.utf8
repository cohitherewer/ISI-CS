          PARAN BALAKRISHNAN                       Tough laws                    
	New Delhi, Jan. 7: The chairman and the directors of Satyam Computer Services could face civil and criminal liabilities in the US as the company is listed on the New York-based Nasdaq exchange.        
	The US Securities and Exchange Commission (the equivalent of Indias Sebi) has tough laws governing statements made at the time of listing. Satyam listed on the Nasdaq in 1999. Its shares rose 161 per cent soon after it listed.         
	In addition, the company could face both civil and criminal actions if later quarterly statements contain false declarations. The companys directors could face up to five years imprisonment for such misstatements, say lawyers familiar with US securities laws. In addition, they could face fines.        
	If the company made false statements at the time of registration, everyone involved in the issue of the American Depository Receipts (ADRs), including the auditors and the underwriters, could face trouble.         
	The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) can file cases concurrently even if cases are also filed in India at the same time. Under US law, the cases have to be filed within one year of the discovery of a misstatement.        
	The position on independent directors is more fuzzy. In the US, the position is that if they were aware of fraud and were grossly negligent, they could face liability. Also, directors who sit on a companys audit committee probably face a greater danger of prosecution, say lawyers.        
	In the US, the general rule is that the burden of proof is on the directors to prove that they were not negligent. Thats inevitably slightly more tricky because they have to show that they werent negligent.         
	Under Indian law, on the other hand, directors have to show that even if they exercised due care and skill, they could not have discovered the misstatements by the company.

          OUR BUREAU                            Water of a swelling Subernarekha crosses the danger level at Mango on Tuesday. Bhola Prasad                                  
	Bokaro/Jamshedpur/Dhanbad, Sept. 8: Ravenous rivers and rain-fed reservoirs have risen menacingly for two days, triggering flash floods in low-lying areas of Bokaro, East Singhbhum and Dhanbad and fears of inundation in Seraikela-Kharsawan.        
	Bermo in Bokaro has been the worst affected. A swelling Damodar  flowing 12ft above the danger mark of 852ft following release of water to ease pressure on Tenughat, Konar and Garga dams  has engulfed vast swathes of the sub-division, prompting mass exodus from dozens of marooned villages.        
	District officials said 10 sluice gates of Tenughat and two each of Konar and Garga were opened to stop the dams from flooding the thermal power station at Lalpania.         
	Deputy commissioner Satyendra Singh said water was released two hours after villagers were asked to evacuate the area. The victims have taken shelter in makeshift camps set up by the administration.         
	East Singhbhums worst fears came true today, with the Subernarekha and Kharkai rivers crossing the red line after release of water from the Bankabal dam in neighbouring Mayurbhanj district of Orissa.         
	Last night, the Mayurbhanj irrigation department issued a communiqu to the district administration, as well as officials of Seraikela-Kharsawan, saying that it was releasing 45 cumec water to ease the pressure on the reservoir.        
	Accordingly, a sluice gate of the dam was opened at 1am. The water level in both the rivers began rising from 9am and by noon kissed the danger mark.        
	 Readings taken by the Central Water Commissions observation centre at Mango showed that the water level in Subernarekha crossed 121.550m at noon and inched higher till 2pm, when it recorded 121.580m. The rivers danger mark is 121.50m.        
	 The observation centre at Adityapur recorded the highest water level (131.10m) in Kharkai around noon. The danger mark of the river is 129.90m.         
	Manoranjan Patnaik, head of Bankabal medium irrigation project in Orissa, however, claimed that the water released was 43.68 cumec. The outflow was scaled down to 21.5 cumec from 3pm, he said, indicating that the neighbouring state did not release excess water causing flash floods in East Singhbhum.        
	Additional deputy commissioner, East Singhbhum, H.N. Ram said the rivers swelled between noon and 2pm, flooding low-lying areas in Mango and Shastrinagar.         
	But the situation is not alarming yet. Water has not entered residential areas and the river level is receding. Our officials are on alert, he said.        
	Sub-divisional officer of Seraikela-Kharsawan C.K. Singh also maintained that the level of Kharkai was receding since evening. He added that the flash flood control centre at Adityapur Industrial Area would remain on alert.         
	While the situation has not spun out of control, worries may be far from over. An official at Bankabal said that the present water level of the dam was 304.44m and it was equipped to hold up to 305m.         
	We may have to open more sluice gates if the weather worsens and there is concentrated rainfall in the catchment areas, he said. The only good news is that there was no new sign of cyclonic circulation and Jamshedpur saw an almost clear sky for most part of the day. But, while East Singhbhum has a silver lining, the shadow of the ark cloud has only lengthened over Dhanbad. Several areas, including Nirsa and Baliapur, have been inundated following release of water from Maithon and Panchet reservoirs for the past two days.         
	The level at Maithon reached 4.9ft above the danger mark of 490ft, forcing the Damodar Valley Reservoir Regulation Committee to release 1,60,000 cusec since yesterday. Panchet, on the other hand, released 1,80,000 cusec.        
	Mineral Area Development Authority (Mada) SDO Shailendra Singh said though the downpour and subsequent water discharge from dams had affected mining activities, the situation would look up in the next couple of days.

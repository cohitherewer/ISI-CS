          SUDHIR KUMAR MISHRA                            Champai Soren in Ranchi on Sunday. Telegraph picture                                  
	Ranchi, Jan. 18: It was an uneasy calm in the corridors of power today with barely 24 hours remaining before a crucial meeting in Delhi pronounced the fate of Jharkhand.        
	Sources said that the Union cabinet co-ordination committee meeting would virtually decide to put the state under Presidents rule. The Assembly, however, will be kept under suspended animation to enable the formation of an alternative government within reasonable time.         
	The miracle that railway minister and RJD chief Lalu Prasad might do overnight is, therefore, being anticipated with great curiosity. He is expected to return from Japan late this evening.        
	In the state, caretaker chief minister Shibu Soren is still on his hospital bed and Raj Bhavan is maintaining a studied silence. Soren and his men are waiting for a Lalu miracle.        
	A section of RJD leaders today rushed to Delhi to greet their party chief while BJP members went into a huddle to chalk out plans. The CPI-ML(Liberation) took out a torchlight rally in the evening. It has called a bandh tomorrow, demanding Presidents rule.        
	The governor did not have any important engagement today. There has been no major development. Everything depends on Delhi, a Raj Bhavan spokesman summed it up.        
	Soren seems to have decided against going to Delhi without formal invitations from UPA chairperson Sonia Gandhi or Lalu. He is also not willing to drop his recommendation in favour of Seraikela MLA Champai Soren.         
	Deputy chief minister Sudhir Mahto, however, hinted that the caretaker chief minister might leave for Delhi tomorrow. Sorens son Durga returned from Delhi on a chartered plane in the evening and he is likely to take the same to the country capital. Our emissary to Delhi, Raj Mahal MP Hemlal Murmu, has already spoken to Soniajis political secretary Ahmed Patel and Union company affairs minister and RJD leader Prem Chand Gupta. Both of them have categorically said that they did not favour Presidents rule, Mahto said.         
	A section of the media also reported that Durga held a closed-door meeting with senior BJP leader Yashwant Sinha yesterday. They discussed viable alternatives.         
	Insiders, however, claim that central rule is imminent and Gupta had rejected Murmus request on Champai.

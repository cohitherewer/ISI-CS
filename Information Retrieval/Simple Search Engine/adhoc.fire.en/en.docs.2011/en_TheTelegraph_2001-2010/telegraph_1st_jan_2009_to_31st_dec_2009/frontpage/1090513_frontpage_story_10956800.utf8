The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Cong-UDP win coalition game
                                                                                                           Cong-UDP win coalition game
  - Meghalaya government to be sworn in today        OUR CORRESPONDENT                                          
	Shillong, May 12: A bad bargain of cabinet seats cost the Nationalist Congress Party its chance to continue governance in Meghalaya, giving its once coalition partner, the United Democratic Party, another opportunity to sit in the treasury benches, this time with the Congress.        
	After a rush of last-minute negotiations, the UDP and the Congress  which had been holding hectic parleys with the NCP for a week  decided to stake claim to the next government, which will be sworn in by Governor R.S. Mooshahary at 11.30am tomorrow.        
	Congress Legislature Party leader D.D. Lapang will be the chief minister, while current Speaker Bindo Lanong from the UDP will be appointed deputy chief minister.        
	Senior Congress legislator, Mukul Sangma, will be the other deputy chief minister.         
	An arrangement has been arrived at between the Congress and the UDP that Lanong will be sworn in as the deputy chief minister at a later date. He will resign from the post of Speaker in a day or two.         
	Another legislator from the party, J.A. Lyngdoh, will be given the post of a cabinet minister.         
	The UDP decided to accommodate Lyngdoh in the proposed ministry, as he was the one to negotiate for the new alliance.         
	Senior Congress legislator Charles Pyngrope is likely to be appointed as the new Speaker.         
	According to the agreement between the Congress and the UDP, out of the 12 ministers, only two cabinet berths will be given to the UDP. The NCP had asked for five.        
	The stunning turn of events emerged after hectic meetings between the Congress and the UDP.        
	Lapang rushed to Shillong this morning from New Delhi after he got the blessings from the AICC leaders to have a Congress-UDP government in the state.        
	UDP legislator J.A. Lyngdoh had already been speaking to the AICC leaders for the past two days in Delhi.        
	After a meeting, the parties signed a memorandum of understanding to work under the banner Meghalaya United Alliance (MUA).        
	Lapang did not want to change the name of his old alliance, MUA, which had the support of 26 Congress legislators and one Independent, A.T. Mondal.         
	Another Independent legislator, Donkupar Massar, who was earlier with the Meghalaya Progressive Alliance, is now supporting the MUA, taking its strength to 28.         
	Later, the Congress leaders, AICC general secretary in-charge of Northeast, A. Luizinho Faleiro, Meghalaya PCC president Friday Lyngdoh, UDP president Donkupar Roy and UDP Legislature Party leader J.D. Rymbai met the governor and staked claim to form the government.         
	While the Congress-led MUA submitted the list of 28 legislators, which include 26 from the Congress and two Independents, the UDP submitted the list of nine legislators.         
	The list did not contain the names of four disqualified legislators  Paul Lyngdoh (KHNAM), Sanbor Shullai (NCP) and two Independents Ismail Marak and Limison Sangma  who had supported the Congress-led MUA in the time of crisis.        
	Neither did it mention UDP legislator Ampareen Lyngdoh, who had resigned recently.         
	A Congress leader said as far as the four disqualified legislators are concerned, once the court clears their pending petition against the disqualification, the party may think about inducting them in the ministry.         
	The Congress is also contemplating accommodating Ampareen Lyngdoh in the ministry at a later stage.         
	Roy and Rymbai told reporters after their meeting with the governor that they had opted out of the ministry.         
	The UDP had a meeting and we decided that the party legislators Bindo Lanong and J.A. Lyngdoh will be accommodated in the ministry, Rymbai said.         
	Rymbai said Roy would be appointed as the chairman of the State Planning Board.         
	He also said the UDP decided to extend support to the Congress only after the NCP, which was a major coalition partner of the Meghalay Progressive Alliance, betrayed the group.         
	PCC president Friday Lyngdoh said since the NCP bargained for too much in terms of cabinet berths and other political appointments, the proposed alliance with the party did not work out.         
	Lapang echoed him and added that he was abiding by the decision of the high command.         
	Later in the evening, a Congress Legislature Party meeting was held to endorse the decision of both the Congress and the UDP to form a coalition government.         
	Addressing the media at Raj Bhavan, the governor said he fixed the swearing-in for tomorrow only after he was satisfied with the majority support from both the Congress-led MUA and UDP.        
	To a question on the four disqualified legislators, the governor said the Constitution bars the swearing-in of disqualified legislators and they can be accommodated only after the court clears the pending cases.         
	The governor has given a 15-day deadline to the new combine to prove its majority.

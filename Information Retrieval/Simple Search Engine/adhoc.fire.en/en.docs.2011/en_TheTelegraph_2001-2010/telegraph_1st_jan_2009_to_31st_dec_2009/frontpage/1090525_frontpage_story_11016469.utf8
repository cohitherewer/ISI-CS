  - Chennai Super Kings girl pips Shah Rukhs at Miss IPL bollywood post          PRATIM D. GUPTA                            Dune Kossatz, who won the Miss IPL Bollywood contest                                        
	Johannesburg, May 24: The Kolkata Knight Riders have come first runners-up. Not in the game but in a Bollywood talent hunt of sorts conducted in the galleries.        
	The winner of the Miss IPL Bollywood contest, Dune Kossatz from East London, was from the Chennai Super Kings, the team that lost at the Wanderers last evening.        
	Kossatz, a 34-year-old actress, edged past the Kolkata Knight Riderss Genna Cloud, the first runners-up. Dunay Nortje, from Royal Challengers Bangalore team, came third.         
	Kossatz had got the highest number of SMS votes when the South African audience short-listed 15 girls from the 48 selected at the different match venues throughout the tournament. Then too, Genna, a marketing graduate from Johannesburg who wants to become a singer, came second.         
	I think the fact that I am an actress and lots of people have seen me sure helped me reach here, Kossatz said, moments after former Miss Universe Michelle McLean crowned her early this morning at Montecasino Theatre.         
	Kossatz has done a few independent films in South Africa and made appearances in American TV series like Las Vegas and Passions.         
	But now, she has landed herself a chance in Bollywood, besides winning 50,000 rands (around Rs 3,00,000) and a free trip to India during the Champions League later in the year.        
	Kossatz will get to do a Bollywood screen test. I so hope that its a Shah Rukh Khan film, she said. I think he is a great actor and director.         
	Well, the director bit was wrong  Shah Rukh is yet to direct a film  but at 34, which is easily 10 years older than the rest of the girls, Kossatz probably is the most suited to do a movie opposite 43-year-old SRK.         
	KKR girl Genna didnt look unhappy. I am really excited about going to India, a place I have always wanted to go, said the 24-year-old who too has the free trip as part of the prize. Since I am a singer, I would like to collaborate with musicians there and may be do some fusion work.         
	The highlight of the Miss IPL Bollywood show was a stirring performance by reggae veteran Eddy Grant who brought the entire auditorium to its feet, including Lalit Modi and Shilpa Shetty.         
	Other performers included American R amp;B singer Akon and percussionist Shivmani.

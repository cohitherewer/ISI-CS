	London, Nov. 27 (PTI): David Beckham sure has expensive tastes as he gifted himself a brand new Bentley for Thanksgiving.         
	He added the luxury car to his fleet which already includes a BMW, Ferrari, Lamborghini, Aston Martin, Porsche and a Hummer.        
	Beckham took the silver Bentley out for a ride in Beverly Hills, but with so many cars to choose from he wasnt at the new vehicles wheel for too long, reports the Daily Mail .        
	The LA Galaxy player then took out his Cadillac Escalade for a family trip to Nobu and the Hummer to a private party.         
	This isnt the first time that the 34-year-old has splashed out on a Bentley. His first cost a whopping 240,000 but was left behind in the UK when he moved to Spain.        
	It was later put up for sale, complete with a fridge, diamond cross handles and televisions in the rear seats. Since moving to the US, Beckham has been busy adding to his car collection. He is often spotted in a black Rolls Royce Phantom Drophead Coupe.

  -   PM gets cracking with core portfolios, rest later
          SANKARSHAN THAKUR                                             
	New Delhi, May 23: Prime Minister Manmohan Singh kick-started his second term with a working weekend which began with a cabinet meeting that took a slew of procedural decisions this morning.        
	Eager not to appear stalled by a political impasse, Singh bypassed negotiations with the DMK and constituted two key cabinet core groups, slated the opening of the 15th Lok Sabha for June 1 and handed out six vital departments to top colleagues. Pranab Mukherjee gets his preferred finance brief, P. Chidambaram keeps home and A.K. Antony defence, Sharad Pawar remains in charge of Krishi Bhawan, Mamata Banerjee bags railways and new inductee S.M. Krishna becomes boss of the foreign office.         
	Mukherjee, Chidambaram, Krishna and Antony make up the new cabinet committee on security with the Prime Minister; the cabinet committee on political affairs comprises all six ministers awarded portfolios today and will most likely be expanded once Singhs entire team takes office.         
	A new government has taken office and a country like India cannot afford to have key departments unmanned while political haggling proceeds, a prime ministerial aide told The Telegraph, We cannot put national exigencies on hold. What has happened today is an urgent and required move in that direction.         
	The 15th Lok Sabha begins its first sitting with a two-day oath-taking starting June 1. The new Speaker is to be elected on June 3.        
	Briefing the media on todays cabinet, Chidambaram said the budget will be presented before July 31 as required.         
	But even as the new government got under way  new faces Krishna and Mamata both airing their first thoughts to journalists  the focus remained on backstage negotiations over the completion of ministry formation. Talks with the DMK were on both in Chennai and long-distance from Delhi. Congress sources indicated that despite a lowering of tempers in the Karunanidhi camp, settlement continued to elude the negotiators.         
	Ghulam Nabi Azad, tasked with brokering a fresh deal with the southern ally, underplayed differences and said: They (the DMK) are our pre-poll allies, there is no problem, all will be resolved in time.         
	The main roadblock, it appears, is over handing charge of shipping and surface transport to the DMK. T.R. Baalu is apparently very keen to get the shipping ministry because of his, and his partys, interest in fast-tracking the controversial Sethusamudram project.         
	Suspense gripped the Congress itself, with many of those sworn in yesterday unsure of what lies in store for them. Kamal Nath, for instance, was said to be keen on external affairs, but shall now have to wait to see if he stays on in commerce or is given another charge.         
	Congress sources said hectic lobbying was still on for portfolios and ministerial berths, the majority of which await filling. Some more cabinet ministers from the Congress are expected to be inducted in the next round and one of those hoping to get lucky is law minister in the last government, H.R. Bharadwaj. Sources said Bharadwaj is pressing the loyalty card with the high command and seeking re-entry even if he does not retain law.         
	Several young and fresh faces  as well as more ranks from among allies  await induction into the government. The NCPs Praful Patel will walk in with another junior colleague, Mamatas Trinamul Congress will get minister of state jobs, apart from a substantial number of Congress MPs, most of them likely to be from the new Lok Sabha.         
	The leadership is aware that regional and other corrections need to be done quickly, but you did not get a composite picture of what is planned because the entire council of ministers could not be sworn in at one go, a Congress leader said, indicating Uttar Pradesh, where the party has done unexpectedly well, will get a handsome representation.

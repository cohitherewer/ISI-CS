The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | BJP moves SC for polls
                                                                                                           BJP moves SC for polls
          SUMAN K. SHRIVASTAVA                              
	Ranchi, Sept. 7: The BJP extended the ambit of its agitation against the Centres inaction in dissolving the Assembly by moving the Supreme Court today, even as its parliamentary board okayed MLAs plans to resign from the House en masse.        
	After a meeting of the BJP parliamentary board, the party general secretary, Ananth Kumar, told reporters in New Delhi that their MLAs would put in their papers to the Speaker as well as the governor on September 9, demanding early elections in Jharkhand.        
	BJP MP Arjun Munda said the Congress-led Centre dissolved the House in Haryana and decided to go for premature elections, believing that the scenario was in its favour. However, it dragged its feet in Jharkhand as it feared that the scenario wasnt favourable for it, he alleged.        
	State BJP state president Raghubar Das, who along with Munda and MLA Dinesh Sarangi attended the meeting, said the parliamentary board had also approved their plan of action over the next three months. We will also be going to the peoples court to expose how the Congress was cheating people, he declared.         
	While moving the Supreme Court, the BJP sought a directive to the Centre to dissolve the House and hold elections along with Maharashtra and Haryana.         
	Former advocate-general Anil Kumar Sinha, who filed the writ petition on behalf of BJP spokesman Sanjay Seth, said the Centres decision to keep the House under suspended animation for the last eight months was a fraud on the Constitution.        
	The decision should be declared illegal and malafide, the petition said.         
	Sinha said they wanted the apex court to direct the Centre as well as the Election Commission to dissolve the House and hold elections immediately. And the President, he added, was empowered under Article 356 to either dissolve the House or keep it under suspended animation.         
	The House is dissolved when the constitutional machinery totally collapses while it is suspended when there is some hope of forming an alternative government, he added.        
	But significantly, eight months had passed since the House was kept under suspended animation and political party had staked claim to form an alternative government. Yet the House was kept under suspended animation.        
	Sinha said the Centre while seeking extension of Presidents rule had to assign a specific reason for doing so.                     
	In order to avoid it, Union home minister P. Chidambaram promised to hold elections after the monsoon prompting the BJP to drop its plan to oppose the proposal in Parliament. But the Centre failed to keep its word, the petition stated.        
	The BJPs petition also provided graphic details of the deteriorating law and order situation in the state amid growing Naxalite attacks to show that Presidents rule hadnt proved to be a boon for the state.        
	The intention to continue Presidents rule is malafide as it was aimed to establish the Congress, the petition alleged.

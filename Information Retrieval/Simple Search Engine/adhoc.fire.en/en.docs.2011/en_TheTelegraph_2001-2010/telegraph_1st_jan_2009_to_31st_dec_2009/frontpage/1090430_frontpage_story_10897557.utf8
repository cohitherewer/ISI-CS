                                                                                                           Ambani staff to be quizzed 
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                        Borges wife and children; (below) Borge Picture by Raju Sanadi				                                       
	Mumbai, April 29: The family of Bharat Borge, the aviation technician found dead days after reporting that Anil Ambanis helicopter had been tampered with, has demanded a CBI probe even as police said they would question Ambani employees about their meeting with the technician.        
	Borge, 47, was found dead on the tracks near a railway crossing between Vile Parle and Andheri stations in the western suburbs yesterday morning. A note was found in his trouser pocket.        
	His elder brother Anand Borge said today: His death does not look like either a suicide or an accident. We demand a CBI investigation.        
	A senior technician with chopper maintenance company Airworks Engineering Ltd, Bharat was the key witness in the Ambani helicopter sabotage case since he had on April 23 found pebbles and gravel in the fuel tank of the Bell 412 Anil was to fly the next day.         
	The preliminary post-mortem report showed his death was caused by multiple fractures and haemorrhage.         
	Borges body was sent this morning to his village in Borgewadi in Satara district, where his wife Sangeeta and children  18-year-old daughter Anu and 15-year-old son Abhijeet  had gone on April 18 on summer vacation.         
	Anand, who sells fish at the wholesale Crawford Market in Mumbai, said over phone from Borgewadi that his brother took a train at 7am every day to work from his Bhayander home in the far eastern suburbs. He got off at Santa Cruz, the station closest to the Airworks hangar in Santa Cruz East.         
	Borges body was found one station before Santa Cruz.         
	Why did he get off at Vile Parle station and what was he doing at the railway crossing? He called me at 7.34am and chatted normally about my arrival in Mumbai from our village. He did not mention the chopper probe nor did he sound nervous or worried, said Anand, adding that he hadnt seen the letter found on his brother. The letter says Borge feared he would be implicated in the case.         
	Joint commissioner (crime) Rakesh Maria, who heads a special team probing the alleged chopper sabotage, said today: Let me set the record straight. Borge was a witness and never a suspect.         
	Maria said his team had made good headway and was confident of an early breakthrough. Borge had corroborated the line of probe and had met crime branch officials on Monday with Airworks engineer and his superior Vara Prasad.         
	We have been able to fix the location of the helicopter (when the tampering took place) and also the rough time of the incident, Maria said.         
	The Government Railway Police were probing Borges death, he added.         
	GRP commissioner Ashok Sharma said Anil Dhirubhai Ambani Group (ADAG) officials who met Borge a day before his death and Airworks staff were likely to be questioned.         
	We have lodged an accidental death case, but it is still not clear if it is a suicide or an accident, Sharma said.         
	Statements of six witnesses  the gateman of the railway crossing, Gopichand Pawar, the motorman and guard of the train that knocked him down, the Andheri stationmaster and two shopkeepers  have been recorded.         
	Maharashtra home minister Jayant Patil denied there was evidence of corporate rivalry behind Borges death.         
	Chief minister Ashok Chavan said the crime branch would make a breakthrough in two days.         
	ADAG officials said they had terminated the two-year-old maintenance contract with Airworks. But an Airworks spokesperson said: We have not received any official communication, either verbal or written, from ADAG as of 5.30pm today.         
	Anand said his brothers family had lost its only earning member. My brother saved the life of a billionaire like Anil Ambani. He should not only get justice but an award for his sharpness in detecting the tampering.

	Bhubaneswar, Feb. 8: For the poor animals at Nandan Kanan, it was a day to fast, as their caretakers went on an indefinite strike demanding a better deal for themselves.        
	As many as 131 ground-level staff went on a strike under the umbrella of Nandan Kanan Pragatisheel Shramik Sangh demanding permanent jobs, medical facilities and insurance benefits.        
	The zoo houses 1,200 animals of 128 species of mammals, birds and reptiles, who are fed twice everyday. Managing the show with 20-odd permanent staff had become a headache for the authorities, thus to meet the emergency, authorities roped in volunteers from animal rights bodies, including the People for Animals and Snake Helpline, thus leading to a controversy. For now the volunteers are meeting the temporary needs. We are also asking the workers to call off their strike, said Ajit Pattnaik, the zoo director.         
	However, the striking employees are not confident regarding volunteers skills. The idea of using volunteers is sick. They would do it for the money, while we do it for love. The animals are like our children. We know their tastes, preferences and feeding time, Nayak said.        
	The agitating workers comprise caretakers, cleaners, gardeners and security persons, who are demanding a dispensary to meet emergency medical needs. There is at least one accident every day. While some are minor, few are critical and the victim has to be rushed to the nearest hospital, nearly 20km away. There should be medical facilities on the campus, said the sanghs general secretary, Ramakant Nayak. Besides, the Sangh has also been pressing for medical insurance.         
	Staff Ananta Nayak was killed by a lion, while another was killed by an elephant. Similarly, Gundicha Nayak was dragged into the lions cage by the animal, but he miraculously escaped. Our lives ought to be insured, said Jugal Kishore.         
	We have been demanding the facilities for years now. This time we will continue our strike till demands are met, he added.        
	Meanwhile, volunteers who have been roped in to feed the animals had a tough time as many refused to eat. One of the crocodiles reacted violently and tried to attack us. It was easier with the tortoises, snakes and other reptiles, said Suvendu Behera of Snake Helpline. Being a Sunday, there were many visitors to the park. Besides the upkeep of cages, the sanitation facilities were also affected.

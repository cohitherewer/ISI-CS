The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Railway plus six juniors
                                                                                                           Railway plus six juniors
          OUR BUREAU                                              
	May 21: Mamata Banerjee is expected to be given the railway ministry, and her party colleagues six minister of state berths.        
	The Trinamul Congress has been promised junior ministerships in port, rural development, urban development, health, tourism and one slot in either culture or information and broadcasting.         
	Trinamul MP Dinesh Trivedi is expected to be the minister of state for health. The names of other Trinamul nominees were being finalised late tonight. Sishir Adhikary, Sultan Ahmed, Saugata Roy and Mukul Roy are said to be among the frontrunners. As Mukul Roy is a Rajya Sabha MP, it was not clear whether he would make it to Mamatas final list.        
	Sources said Mamata would have been happier with fewer junior ministerships which, she thinks, would have helped her keep the flock on a tighter leash.         
	But with the DMK, which has one MP less than Trinamuls 19, clamouring for more, Mamata agreed to the higher quota to avoid uncharitable comparisons within her party.        
	Her original plan was to opt for one cabinet and two ministers of state. Left to her, Mamata would have preferred fewer berths for the DMK, too, the sources said. She decided to accept more when it became clear that the DMK was driving a hard bargain, the sources added.        
	Mamata is learnt to have told the UPA leadership that as far as possible, Trinamuls junior ministers should be given slots under Congress cabinet ministers.        
	She has also requested that the minister of state for railways should not be from the DMK, apparently to ensure that the ministry is shielded from corruption charges.        
	If any charges are levelled at the junior minister, the cabinet minister could also be drawn into the controversy for no fault of ours. We want to avoid that, a Trinamul source said.        
	Accompanied by Trivedi and Mukul, Mamata today visited 15 Rakabgunj Road, a house which had until May 15 doubled as the Congresss war room and is now hosting ministry talks. She was received by Congress leaders A.K. Antony and Ahmed Patel, who are assigned by Sonia Gandhi to hold portfolio talks.        
	There is no bargaining. What they (Congress) want, they will do. Even if they dont give us anything, we dont mind, Mamata said after talks with Antony and Ahmed.        
	The Trinamul leader said she wanted her partys relations with Congress to remain good. More important than ministerial positions is to have stable government.

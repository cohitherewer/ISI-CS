The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | BJP repairs Rudy jolt with JMM unity show
                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                BJP repairs Rudy jolt with JMM unity show
  - Governor asks Soren to face trial of strength on Jan. 8        RADHIKA RAMSESHAN                            JMM chief Shibu Soren with BJP national president Nitin Gadkari at the BJP party office in Mumbai on Monday. (PTI)                                        
	New Delhi, Dec. 28: Two days before installing their coalition government in Ranchi, the Jharkhand Mukti Morcha (JMM), BJP and the NDA put up a unity show necessitated by BJP spokesperson Rajiv Pratap Rudys reported remarks that he was opposed to the partys alliance with Shibu Sorens outfit.        
	With Rudys comments threatening to cast a shadow over the prospective coalitions durability even before it came into being, chief minister in-waiting Shibu Soren flew to Mumbai today to meet BJP president Nitin Gadkari who instantly began damage control by claiming the party spokespersons statements were twisted out of context.        
	Rudy was directed to clarify his remarks made while addressing a meeting of the RSSs student wing, Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarti Parishad,in Calcutta on December 26.        
	He claimed the remarks were his personal views and were made before the BJPs parliamentary board had taken a call on supporting the JMM.        
	Three options were being thought of. Should we sit in the Opposition? Should we support a government from outside or should we be part of it? I was merely answering a question on what a party with strong ideological moorings like the BJP should do when it does not get a clear mandate, Rudy clarified.        
	Then, Sushma Swaraj, the leader of the Opposition in the Lok Sabha, endorsed Sorens leadership from Bhopal, saying he was no longer a tainted person.        
	 By late evening Soren landed in New Delhi and drove to the residence of Sharad Yadav, the JD(U) leader and NDA convener.         
	They addressed the media with Sudesh Mahto, the Ajsu president, Yashwant Sinha, the Hazaribagh MP, and Raghubar Das, the Jharkhand BJP president, in an apparent re-affirmation of their solidarity.        
	Soren was later expected to call on L.K. Advani, chairman of the BJP parliamentary party.        
	As questions flew thick and fast on how the BJP could align itself with a person who figured high on its list of tainted politicos when Soren was a minister in UPA-I, Sinha articulated the political rationale.        
	The fundamental difference between this coalition and the earlier ones is that its core is made up of political parties. The JMM, BJP and Ajsu are hardcore political parties and will, therefore, give a government that will last its term. The two or three Independents who have come on board have promised to give us unconditional support. Let us not forget that the previous government lived on the mercy of a few Independents, he said.        
	Sinha also announced that although the constituents of the prospective coalition (barring the NDA) fought the Assembly polls on Independent manifestos, the government would run on the basis of a common agreed agenda that would be stability, no corruption and a commitment to development.        
	Asked if Soren and the Ajsu would become part of the NDA, Yadav replied: That will be considered later.        
	Party sources said according to the power-sharing formula mutually agreed upon, the BJP and the JMM would get four cabinet berths each, the Ajsu two and the JD(U) one.        
	The BJP managed to skim off the cream by also bagging the Speakers post, considered the most important after the chief ministers in a disparate coalition dispensation.        
	Raghubar Das and Mahto will be made deputy chief ministers.        
	The portfolios hadnt been finalised, although the BJP was keen on home, finance and mines and mineral.        
	It wasnt immediately known if Gadkari would be in Ranchi when the ministers take oath of office on December 30 or ask his predecessor, Rajnath Singh, to represent him.

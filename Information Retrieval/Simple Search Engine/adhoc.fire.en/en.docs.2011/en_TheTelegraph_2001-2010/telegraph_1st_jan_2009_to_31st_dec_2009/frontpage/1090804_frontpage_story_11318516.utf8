The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Chakraborty passes away
                                                                                                           Chakraborty passes away
          OUR BUREAU                               
	Calcutta, Aug. 3: After battling cancer for over a year, senior CPM leader and transport minister Subhas Chakraborty, 67, died on Monday morning of multi-organ failure and sepsis. He is survived by his wife and son.         
	The kidney and other vital organs stopped functioning. Infection spread throughout his body, an attending doctor at AMRI hospital in Salt Lake said.         
	Doctors said Chakraborty was suffering from an aggressive form of cancer, which spreads through blood, mostly to the lungs and liver. The cancer was detected in his thigh more than a year ago. On July 27, he was admitted to AMRI with chest infection and other ailments and was put on ventilator yesterday.         
	Chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee, commerce minister Nirupam Sen, CPM state secretary Biman Bose and other senior Left Front leaders rushed to the hospital as hope for his survival dimmed this morning.         
	Many of the hundreds of CPM supporters and admirers, who were waiting outside the hospital, broke down after an emotional Bose announced the death.         
	Amader priya comrade Subhas Chakraborty aar nei (Our dear comrade Subhas Chakraborty is no more), Bose said, choking on the words.         
	Jyoti Basu, whos also regarded as Chakrabortys mentor, said: I should have died at this ripe age instead of Subhas. A young, active and energetic party worker passed away when I have to slog on.         
	Chakrabortys body was taken out of the hospital around 1.30pm and kept at a mortuary on Rafi Ahmed Kidwai Road. The last rites will be performed tomorrow at Keoratala. The government declared state mourning and a holiday today and cancelled all government-sponsored functions till tomorrow.         
	Bose and other CPM leaders said Chakraborty had planned to go abroad for further treatment but that was not to be. After receiving chemotherapy in Delhi, instead of taking the prescribed rest, he threw himself into discussions with transport operators who were threatening indefinite strike.         
	Some of the leaders blamed the transporters for heckling the ailing minister during their meeting, saying it affected his health further.         
	Some observers believe Chakraborty could not fulfil his early political promise. There were moments of public outburst when it had seemed he openly resented being overlooked for greater positions in the party and government.         
	Chakraborty will possibly be remembered more for his penchant for controversies, often at the expense of the party leadership, than as an administrator. His popularity among the CPM ranks and his reputation as an able organiser might have helped him retain his berth despite his illness.         
	CPM leaders admitted that after the passing away of state secretary Anil Biswas in 2006, Chakrabortys death would be another blow to the Left as it confronted the threat of losing the next Assembly elections.

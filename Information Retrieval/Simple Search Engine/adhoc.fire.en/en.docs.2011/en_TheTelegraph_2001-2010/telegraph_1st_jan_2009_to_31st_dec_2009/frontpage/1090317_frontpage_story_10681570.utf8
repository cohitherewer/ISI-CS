The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | IPL runs from pillar to states
                                                                                                           IPL runs from pillar to states
          NISHIT DHOLABHAI AND OUR BUREAU                            Modi, Chidambaram                                
	New Delhi, March 16: The shadow of doubt over the Indian Premier Leagues second season lengthened today with the government telling organisers it would not spare paramilitary forces for host states.         
	The home ministry, however, held out a ray of hope by agreeing to go through another revised schedule.        
	Special secretary (internal security) Raman Srivastava told an IPL delegation the Centre could neither spare paramilitary forces, as demanded by seven host states, nor exempt personnel committed by states for election duty. Bengal and Punjab had placed both demands.        
	The ministry has in effect shifted the onus of security back on the states. The BCCI team has been asked to work out a new schedule in consultation with the state governments, said home ministry spokesperson Onkar Kedia.         
	This implies that states that have asked for central troops would now have to decide whether they are willing to arrange security on their own or decline to host the games.         
	Calcutta, for instance, wont get to stage a match unless the Bengal government works out security without central help. The state had asked for 30 companies of paramilitary forces for the May 4 match as well as an exemption for the state police force from election duty.         
	Bengal chief secretary Asok Mohan Chakrabarti said no fresh intimation had been received from the Centre. We have made our position known to the Centre, expressing our inability to provide additional forces, he said.         
	Sources said the home ministry, which has twice rejected the IPL schedule, took the hard stand after chief election commissioner N. Gopalaswami asked for more than the sanctioned 550 companies (of 125 men each) during the polls.         
	N. Srinivasan, the secretary of the Indian cricket board, said the ministry had explained in detail its concerns. Weve also explained our difficulties and the importance of all stakeholders, said Srinivasan, who was accompanied by Tamil Nadu Cricket Association secretary Kashi Vishwanathan and IPL chief executive officer Sundar Raman at the 90-minute meeting.         
	IPL commissioner Lalit Modi could not meet home minister P. Chidambaram, but put up a brave face. I was here to attend a friends wedding, he said on TV yesterday.         
	After the meeting today, Srinivasan said new dates had not been submitted yet, though sources said the delegation did carry a rejigged timetable.        
	Home ministry officials are understood to have agreed, after much persuasion, to peruse a revised schedule tomorrow. It is likely to include Dharamsala and Ahmedabad as new venues, sources said, while some centres with security issues will be taken off.         
	Sources said some options for IPL now are to have a packed schedule  with up to three matches in a day  and reduce the duration, change the format of the tournament by reducing the number of matches or move games to smaller venues where security can be managed with fewer policemen.

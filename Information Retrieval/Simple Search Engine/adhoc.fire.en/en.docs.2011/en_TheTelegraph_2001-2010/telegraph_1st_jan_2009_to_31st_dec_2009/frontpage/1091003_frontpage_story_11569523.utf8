The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | After seven years of running, daily walk for land 
                                                                                                           After seven years of running, daily walk for land 
          ANANYA SENGUPTA                            Kalpana in front of the Supreme Court. (Ramakant Kushwaha)                                  
	New Delhi, Oct. 2: For seven years, the 45-year-old woman had been running from one office to another for a plot of land she had already paid for. Now she walks.        
	Six days a week, from Parliament House to the Supreme Court.        
	A banner slung from her neck, Kalpana Jha has been walking for the past 35 days.        
	Kalpana and her husband Brajesh had bought a 300sqm plot in Noida, Uttar Pradesh. They wanted to build a house for their child who was yet to be born.        
	That was in 2002, and they have already paid close to Rs 20 lakh. Their daughter Padmakshi is nearly seven now but they are yet to see their land.        
	Since 2002, the Noida Development Authority has been shunting Brajesh from one plot to another claiming unavoidable circumstances.         
	The letter from Noida authorities came on March 30, 2002, informing me that I had been allocated a plot in Sector 72 and needed to pay for the 300sqm plot at Rs 3,300 a square metre. I paid Rs 9,90,000 within 60 days. Its been seven years and I am yet to see my land, says Brajesh.        
	When Brajesh approached Noida officials with the allotment letter in June 2003, they told him development work in an adjoining area was on, so his plot couldnt be registered.        
	Till September 2004 they kept saying development work was in progress. When we went there, officials told us verbally that the allotted land had been encroached on and unless the squatters were removed they couldnt register the plot. Its then that I realised that my house was only on paper, says Brajesh.        
	In 2006, the couple were informed, again verbally, that instead of the plot in Sector 72, they would be allotted one in Sector 43. They were asked to send a consent letter and pay Rs 6 lakh, the difference in the prices of the two plots.        
	The Jhas borrowed money, sold jewellery and family heirlooms, and paid the Authority within 15 days.        
	Days passed, 2006 rolled into 2007, but Kalpana and Brajesh still waited for a glimpse of their plot.        
	In 2007, the Authority again verbally informed Brajesh that the plot he had been allotted was under litigation and couldnt be handed over. In July 2009, they were again asked to write a consent letter for a plot in yet another sector.         
	This time, too, we sent them a consent letter. But we see no hope. We are bankrupt and in debt. We live in a pigeonhole and have to move from one house to another every 11 months as the lease lapses. I could have built my home with Rs 5 lakh in 2002. Now, even if I get the land, I wont be able to build my house with Rs 20 lakh, Brajesh says. Is this justice?        
	No official of the Noida Development Authority was ready to come on record when asked about the couples plight.        
	Kalpana and Brajesh now live with their daughter in a rented house in east Delhi. Astrologers by profession, they have lost most of their clients who have stopped going to their ramshackle home.        
	Since April, Brajesh has written to the President, the Prime Minister, the Chief Justice, the law minister, Sonia Gandhi, Rahul Gandhi and the Central Vigilance Commission, but hasnt got a reply yet.        
	So Kalpana now walks from Parliament House to the Supreme Court with a banner that reads Yeh kaisi aazaadi (what kind of freedom is this)?        
	She walks every day except Sundays. It takes her an hour.

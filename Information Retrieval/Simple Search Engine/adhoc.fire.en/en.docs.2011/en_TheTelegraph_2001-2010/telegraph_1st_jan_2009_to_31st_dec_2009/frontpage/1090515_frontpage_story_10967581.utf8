The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Your briefcase is ready, Sir
                                                                                                           Your briefcase is ready, Sir
          JAYANTH JACOB                              
	New Delhi, May 14: The order for briefcases has already been placed.        
	Not for suitcase politics that apparently follows tight elections but to welcome the 543 newly elected MPs to the 15th Lok Sabha.        
	A group of officials has been sparing no effort to make sure that the MPs get a warm reception before the Lok Sabha gets down to weighty business such as who should rule the country.        
	Led by Lok Sabha secretary-general P.D.T. Achary, the officials are working to a plan that includes fixing temporary accommodation for the new members, taking care of administrative requirements, sprucing up security and buying briefcases.        
	The order has been placed for 550 briefcases, at a maximum price of Rs 4,000 each, including taxes. The suitcase  usually black or tan  is an accessory made available to all members of the House.        
	The MPs will feel the difference at their first footfall in the capital. They will be driven to Parliament House straight from the airport and railway stations for fulfilling some official formalities, Achary, the topmost bureaucrat of the lower House, told The Telegraph.        
	If a member happens to be a new entrant, he or she would already have got a welcome letter from Achary. The letter would have informed the member about reception desks to be set up at stations and airports and travel arrangements to Parliament House.        
	At the Parliament building, room No. 62 will function as a round-the-clock reception room for the MPs for the initial formalities. From there, they will be taken to their accommodations.        
	For new members, the state bhavans  or guest houses  and a hotel will act as temporary places of stay till they get a suitable residence.        
	Sources said arrangements were being made so that the MPs could start work as early as possible. They will soon be given letterheads and visiting cards, all embossed with the national emblem.        
	The 15th Lok Sabha will have more security arrangements than the 14th. Officials said four more mine detectors and 14 cellphone de-activators will be pressed into service.

	Copenhagen, Dec. 18: World leaders scrambled   to patch together a non-  binding political stateme-  nt late tonight after fail  ing to agree on the Copen  hagen summits key objec  tive of taking urgent ac  tion against climate   change.  
	 A weak statement, touted   as the Copenhagen Accord, ap  peared on its way after Presi  dent Barack Obamas meeting   with Prime Minister Manmo  han Singh and leaders of Ch-  ina, Brazil and South Africa.  
	 We are close to seeing a   legally non-binding Copen  hagen outcome after 36 hours   of gruelling, intensive negoti  ations, environment minis  ter Jairam Ramesh said.							   
	A US official claimed that   Obama had reached a deal   with India, China, Brazil and   South Africa.  
	 It is not sufficient to com  bat the threat of climate   change, but its an important   first step, a late-night New   York Times report quoted the   official as saying.  
	 The draft statement falls   far short of the aims with   which the leaders gathered   here: to set new and ambitious   emission cut targets for indus  trialised countries and for  malise financial and techno  logical assistance for develop  ing nations.							   
	The draft, leaked to non-  government observers at the   summit, indicates that the de  veloping countries would have   to list their own domestic tar  gets through an international   process, a proposal India has   resisted in the past.							   
	Sources said the political   pledge by the leaders is expect  ed to be accompanied by two   drafts from negotiating gr-ou-  ps  one on emission reduc  tions by the industrialised co-  u-ntries and the other involv  ing long-term cooperative ac  tion.  
	I wont say the Copen  hagen talks have completely   failed  there is certain   progress in discussions, said   Shyam Saran, Indias special   envoy on climate change.   However, as the Prime Mi-n-  ister said, we expected more   from Copenhagen.  
	 An appendix in the leaked   draft of the proposed political   statement suggests that the de-  veloping countries would have   to list their domestic emis  sion-curbing actions, known   as nationally appropriate mit  igation actions, just as the in  dustrialised countries would   have to list their own emission   reduction targets.  
	 Senior Indian officials   have in the past argued that   this violates the principle of   the 12-year-old Kyoto Protocol   that imposed legally binding   targets only on the industri  alised countries. India has in   the past resisted attempts to   open domestic actions to inter  national scrutiny.							   
	Despite compromises by   countries like India and China   over the issue of monitoring   review and verification and   the US pledging funds for poor   countries, there was no agree  ment on fundamental issues   like the fate of the Kyoto Pro  tocol and the Bali Action Plan   after Copenhagen.							   
	There was no consensus on   common but differentiated   mechanisms of responsibility,   either.							   
	Negotiators and ministers   from across the world sat thr-  ough the night seeking to sal  vage a meaningful agreement.							   
	The position of India and   China had hardened as news   spread of a late-night meeting   involving 40 countries appar  ently to produce an umbrella   text to be signed by the lead  ers. Neither India nor China   was invited there.

	Jan. 16: Supporters of the Gorkha Janmukti Morcha and an anti-Gorkhaland mob clashed today as both sides flouted prohibitory orders that has been in place since last night in Malbazar.         
	More than 100 people were injured and one of them was hit by a bullet in the leg. Police denied that there had been any firing. The Kalimpong unit president of the Yuva Morcha, Sunil Pradhan, has been booked under the Arms Act on charges of carrying a pistol and some cartridges.        
	Zulfiquar Hasan, the special inspector-general of police of the Jalpaiguri Range, said: Both sides had flouted the clampdown order.        
	The Akhil Bharatiya Adivasi Vikas Parishad, an anti-Morcha outfit, has called an indefinite bandh in the Dooars from tomorrow in protest. The organisation is against the Morchas demand to include the region as part of the separate state that it wants. The Morcha shut down the hills in the afternoon, allowing only vehicles to move out. A decision regarding the duration of the bandh will be taken tomorrow evening, party general secretary Roshan Giri said.        
	The main battleground was the area between Gurjongjhora railway crossing and Caltex More, a distance of less than 500m where police had set up a barricade to prevent the progress of a Morcha rally. Thousands of hill party supporters were on their way to Nagarkata to hold a public meeting. The Parishad had called a bandh today to thwart the Dooars Chalo campaign of the hill party. Those opposed to Gorkhaland had set up road blockades at the two main entry points to the Dooars  the Damdim crossing, 13km from Gorubathan, and Caltex More.        
	Witnesses said the clash was triggered by incidents of stone-pelting near the railway crossing when the Morcha supporters and picketers came face to face.         
	A contingent of policemen present at the spot was initially unable to stop the heavy stone-throwing. It was only after they started bursting tear gas shells that the warring groups retreated.         
	Records at Gorubathan Primary Health Centre, 20km from the spot, show that 104 injured people have been treated there. Eight persons are currently admitted there. Rajesh Mahato has been admitted to North Bengal Medical College and Hospital with bullet injury.         
	In Nagrakata, about 20km from Malbazar, anti-Gorkhaland supporters attacked two Morcha members on a two-wheeler and set it on fire. They also torched four makeshift shops and burnt down a Morcha dais.         
	Binay Tamang, the media and publicity secretary of the Morcha, said the Parishad was a creation of the ruling CPM. It was a conspiracy of the state government to drive a wedge between the Adivasis and Gorkhas.         
	The inspector-general of police, north Bengal, K.L. Tamta, said eight persons have been arrested. A police jeep was set on fire and 25 policemen have been injured, He denied that there was police firing.        
	Rajesh Lakra, the secretary of the Terai-Dooars committee of the Parishad, held the police responsible for todays incident. If they had stopped the Morcha from entering Jalpaiguri district, there would have been no clash. In Calcutta, state chief secretary Asok Mohan Chakrabarti said the situation is under control.

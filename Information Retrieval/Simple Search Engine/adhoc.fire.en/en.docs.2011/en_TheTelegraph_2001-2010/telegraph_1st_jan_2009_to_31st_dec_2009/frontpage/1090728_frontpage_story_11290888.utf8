The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Putin spoof song big hit on Internet
                                                                                                           Putin spoof song big hit on Internet
                                Putin: Hard man                            
	Moscow, July 27 (Reuters): A spoof song which makes fun of Prime Minister Vladimir Putins hard man image as the saviour of Russias battered economy has been winning fans on the Internet.        
	Public satire of Putin, who stepped down as President in 2008 to become Prime Minister, is rare and state media present the former KGB spy as the main figure handling the crisis.        
	Putin last month publicly humiliated factory owners in the town of Pikalyovo and forced them to reopen their plants after workers protested against unpaid wages.        
	Putin, Putin goes to Pikalyovo. Putin, Putin will make it cool for us, the Russian lyrics say as a bearded man in a suit gyrates.Putin, Putin is quick to do justice. Putin, Putin is our Prime Minister.        
	The Russian song, set to a popular 1970s Czech tune Jozin z Bazin, has had tens of thousands of clicks on the www.youtube.com website in recent days.        
	Putin is Russias most popular politician and his influence has fuelled speculation that he could seek to return to the Kremlin in the future.        
	The spoof song says an election is just around the corner and that the result will be clear to everyone. But the song ends by saying the next Russian President will be the monster who gives his name to the original Czech song.        
	That very popular song tells the story of a village monster which ate tourists.

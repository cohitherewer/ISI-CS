                                                                                                           MPA meet fuels mid-term poll talk 
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                                     
	Shillong, April 4: Meghalaya may be staring at mid-term elections with a majority of the legislators of the Meghalaya Progressive Alliance (MPA) planning to resign en masse to prevent a Congress-led minority government from taking charge of the state.        
	Prominent MPA leaders  NCP president P.A. Sangma, UDP president Donkupar Roy and senior UDP leader Bindo Lanong, who is also the Speaker, held a preliminary meeting last night to discuss the need to resign en masse.         
	The leaders were closeted till late this evening at the residence of Sangma in Shillong for a crucial meeting, fuelling speculation about the legislators of the alliance quitting en masse.         
	Before going in for the meeting, Lanong said, We may take a decision on the resignations after getting a consensus view on the matter.         
	All the MLAs from the NCP, the UDP, the HSPDP, the BJP and two Independents are attending the meeting.         
	 The MPA has the support of 27 members, including the Speaker, with the resignation of two UDP legislators, Ampareen Lyngdoh and Nimarson Momin.         
	The Congress-led Meghalaya United Alliance (MUA) also has the support of 27 legislators at present, minus the four MLAs who deserted the MPA and are facing disqualification proceedings.        
	However, it is prepared to form the new government, claiming a majority of 31, including the four MPA deserters.        
	The MUA also has the support of Lyngdoh and Momin, who resigned as legislators after they were assured of cabinet berths in the Congress-led ministry once it was formed. The Congress is contemplating giving them party tickets so that they can get elected within six months in byelections.         
	According to MPA leaders, legislators of the alliance are thinking of resigning en masse not because the Congress will go ahead with the formation of the government but because of the manner in which the party has bought MLAs.         
	It is very sad to see that the MLAs are being bought by the Congress. Should we allow this trend to continue or go for fresh elections so that the people can select good candidates as they want? MPA secretary Conrad Sangma asked.         
	He called upon the people to cleanse the politics of Meghalaya by electing fresh candidates. We want to give afresh chance to whoever is the best to lead the state as legislators, he added.         
	Echoing his sons views, P.A. Sangma said he was embarrassed by the manner in which the Congress was playing cheap politics.         
	According to him, the Congress was entirely to blame for the crisis.         
	He downplayed the question of additional expenditure in case fresh elections were held in the state, saying mid-term polls would be for the good of the people of the state.        
	The UDP, which suffered a setback with the resignation of its two legislators, also said the MLAs should face the people once again given the current political crisis.        
	A senior UDP leader said though the first timers were apprehensive, all the legislators wanted to resign en masse considering the Congress-triggered political crisis.        
	In the meantime, Limison Sangma and Ismail Marak, the two Independents who had deserted the MPA, today submitted a representation to the Speaker through their lawyer Devajit Saikia, pleading that they should not be disqualified.         
	Lanong had set April 4 as the deadline for them to reply to the fresh showcause notices served to them last week.         
	Saikia told reporters that the Speaker could not disqualify the legislators after the Shillong bench of Gauhati High Court had stayed his order suspending the MLAs.        
	Saikia will submit another representation to the Speaker on April 6 on behalf of Paul Lyngdoh of the KHNAM and Sanbor Shullai of the NCP. Both had deserted the MPA.

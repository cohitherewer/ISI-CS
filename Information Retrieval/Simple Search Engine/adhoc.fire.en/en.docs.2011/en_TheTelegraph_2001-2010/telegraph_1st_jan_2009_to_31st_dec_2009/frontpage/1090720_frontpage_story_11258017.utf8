The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Kasab hangs in reel life
                                                                                                           Kasab hangs in reel life
          SAMYABRATA RAY GOSWAMI                            Rajan Verma, who plays Kasab in the film Total Ten, on the set; (below) Kasab                                 
	Mumbai, July 19: The court is yet to pass its verdict on 26/11 gunman Ajmal Kasab, but Bollywood has already tried, sentenced and hanged the terrorist.        
	Total Ten, a film on the Mumbai terror attacks  touted C-grade by Bollywood analysts  is expected to be unleashed around Independence Day. On screen, Kasabs character gets the rope in a Bollywood-style grand finale.        
	The film is the first one of its kind  as many as 30 titles on the subject were registered with the Indian Motion Picture Producers Association and Association of Motion Picture and Television Programme Producers even before the terror attack was over.        
	But Total Ten director Surinder Suri is ecstatic his film will hit the marquee first  that is if it gets past the censor board.        
	Kasabs lawyer Abbas Kazmi has already objected to the film.        
	This is ridiculous. A trial is under way and the film shows that the accused has been hanged. I am going to take legal action against the filmmakers if it releases, says Kazmi.        
	It may be a tough call, given that the films makers have cleverly called Kasabs character Shahab in the film.        
	So Suri is unperturbed, as is the struggling actor who plays Kasab.        
	Rajan Verma (28), hovering around the fringes of Bollywood and Tellyland so far, is enjoying the sudden attention.        
	Total Ten has suddenly catapulted him as the reigning star of the news-based C-grade flicks. Not bad for a man who ran away from home while in the first year of college and landed in Mumbai in 2000. Sundry bit roles in Doordarshan serials and Bollywood kiddie flicks later, he landed a small part in Sony TVs mega-soap Jassi Jaisi Koi Nahin.        
	Theatre kept him busy after that and he became a part of Makarand Deshpandes troupe till Suri asked him to audition for a lead role with a negative trait.        
	I did not know I was auditioning for Kasabs role. When I came to know about it later, I developed cold feet. Surinder Suri convinced me that the role will get me fame and attention. It has, Verma admits.        
	He plays Varun Gandhi in his next, Guntantra, again a film by Suri.         
	And in a bizarre turn of the script, Suri somehow connects the Varun Gandhi hate speech to the Soumya Vishwanathan murder case as well.        
	How? Simple, by turning the character  Soumya was a television journalist from Delhi in real life  into Varuns love interest.        
	I have not met Varunji yet. But I am a great fan of his. After I started shooting for Total Ten, people started calling me Kasab. I faced threats and attacks. Surinder Suri got hate calls. So we decided to redeem our act by doing a film on Varun Gandhi, said Rajan.        
	A resident of Aligarh, and the son of a block development officer there, Rajan says he saw politicians and their activities at the grassroots level up close. It helps me understand politics and news. I want to do more news-oriented films, he says.        
	Total Teis just not about the 10 terrorists who attacked Mumbai. It is also about the 10 policemen who were awarded the Ashok Chakra posthumously for fighting the terrorists. We also show how young people like Kasab get misguided and turn terrorists. The film shows his life in Pakistan as well, he adds.        
	The actor has already gone to the police twice with threat complaints after he started shooting for Total Ten. The latest one incidentally comes even as the filmmakers get ready for release.        
	I received a letter from unknown persons on June 17. It said: We tried to explain to you earlier that you should not do this film (Total Ten). You did not listen. Now get ready to die, says Rajan excitedly  his voice conveying the drama.        
	Mumbai police say they are investigating. But neither Rajan nor Suri seem particularly worried  as they say, in show business, any publicity is good publicity.

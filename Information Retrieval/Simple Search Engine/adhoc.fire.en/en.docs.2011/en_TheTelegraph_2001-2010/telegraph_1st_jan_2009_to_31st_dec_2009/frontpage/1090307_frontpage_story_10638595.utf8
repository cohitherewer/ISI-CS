          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Calcutta, March 6: Police today arrested an alleged Lashkar-e-Toiba explosives expert at Sealdah railway station, grabbing him as he stepped out of Lalgola Passenger around 11am.        
	Special task force (STF) officers said Abu Taher alias Mohammad Zakaria, 45, was an Indian by birth and lived in North Dinajpur for a while. He apparently confessed he had fled to Rajshahi, Bangladesh, in 1997 after carrying out low-intensity blasts in Delhi, Ludhiana and Rohtak.        
	Taher is allegedly close to the Lashkars Bangladesh chief, Abdul Karim Tunda, who had sent him to Pakistans Muridke  where the Lashkar has its headquarters near Lahore  to be trained in handling explosives.        
	Taher, police said, had given one of his daughters in marriage to Tunda, who is in his 70s.        
	Officers said the suspect had entered Murshidabad from Bangladesh earlier this week. He was apparently booked on a north India-bound train, raising suspicion of a secret mission.        
	The STF said it arrested the man following leads thrown up by the interrogation of some suspects. After questioning Taher, the police arrested an alleged associate, Abdus Sadique, from Suti in Murshidabad.        
	Taher, born in Katihar in Bihar, had graduated from a madarsa at Kishanganj near the Bihar-Bengal border. He then joined a madarsa at Karandighi, North Dinajpur, as a teacher in 1986.         
	After he fled to Rajshahi, Bangladesh, 12 years ago with his wife, he was given the job of motivating young madarsa students in Dhaka to join Lashkar, the officer said.        
	Bangladesh police arrested him during a crackdown on the Jamaat-e-Mujahideen, a Lashkar-backed outfit, in 2005. He later received bail.        
	Rajeev Kumar, special additional commissioner, STF, said Taher had gone to Pakistan in 1999 and undergone training in Muridke for a year.        
	Lashkar has been using the porous India-Bangladesh border to smuggle explosives and operatives into this country, Kumar said. We are probing whether Taher had any role in the recent blasts.        
	In January, Shafiqul, a Bangladeshi, was held in Malda on the charge of smuggling men and RDX into India through the Murshidabad border.

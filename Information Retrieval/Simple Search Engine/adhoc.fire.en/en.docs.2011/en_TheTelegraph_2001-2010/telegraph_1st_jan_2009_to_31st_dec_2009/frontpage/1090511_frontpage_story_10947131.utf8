The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Damsels to Knights rescue 
                                                                                                           Damsels to Knights rescue 
  - Players on the mat, girls keep KKR in the race           PRATIM D. GUPTA                        Knight Riders Shelley, Deccan Chargers Gabriella	(below)			                                             
	Johannesburg, May 10: What Brendon McCullum, Sourav Ganguly, Chris Gayle, Brad Hodge and Ishant Sharma couldnt do, Riona Singh, Shelley Fourie, Chantelle Ek, Carla Dennis and Yashica Khalawan just might.        
	That is, pull off a win for the Kolkata Knight Riders in IPL Season Two. Not with sixes and scalps but with appearance and attitude.        
	Riona, Shelley, Chantelle, Carla and Yashica are the five girls from South Africa representing Knight Riders at the Miss Bollywood contest running parallel with the T20 tournament in protea land. The contest aims to pick the most attractive female spectator from the crowds at the eight South African grounds hosting IPL matches.        
	While the Knights have almost no chance left to make it to the final four, two of the KKR girls (from the five already selected and one more to be picked from the upcoming Knight Riders matches) are certain of making it to the final 16 of the Miss Bollywood contest.        
	The ultimate winner will be offered a role in a Bollywood movie besides a free business-class trip to India and a prize money of 50,000 rands (Rs 2.94 lakh).        
	My cricket team may have lost but I hope to win and make it up for them, 18-year-old Shelley, from Jeffreys Bay, told The Telegraph.        
	Shelley was just another spectator at the Knights match against Kings XI Punjab at Port Elizabeth on May 3 when she was handpicked by IPL organisers to represent the KKR at Miss Bollywood.        
	I was aware of the contest (but) I didnt go there expecting to be selected. Now that I am in, I want to win, she said.        
	Also striving to be the last girl smiling is Riona from Durban. The 19-year-old was rooting for her favourites, Gayle and Ganguly, from the start of the tournament but it now seems the men in black-and-gold have to cheer for her if the Knights have to strike any sort of gold this season.        
	We had a great team but we didnt have a lot of luck, said Riona, who became the first KKR girl to be selected while watching their match at Kingsmead on April 21. Now she hopes to get a call from the IPL organisers before the final 16 are flown to Johannesburg for a fashion show on May 23, which will decide the winner.        
	All the girls at the Miss Bollywood competition are very beautiful, but I am expecting to make it to the top, Riona said.        
	Its a tough competition because the KKR girls will be facing professional opposition.        
	While IPL chairman Lalit Modi had mentioned that he and his team were looking for someone who has the star quality to stand out in a crowd, probably without even trying that hard, some of the girls being picked for some of the other teams are not quite regular spectators. They are experienced models watching the matches to be spotted and picked for the Miss Bollywood contest.        
	Elbe van der Merwe, who is representing the Rajasthan Royals, was the winner of the Sports Illustrated New Model Search in 2007, and is a regular on South African magazine covers. And if Gabriella Demetriades of the Deccan Chargers looks familiar, its because she too is a popular model, gracing the pages of international magazines like FHM.        
	But at least, Shelley, Riona and company are still in the hunt. And, who knows, if one of them does win the Miss Bollywood crown, she might just debut in a Shah Rukh Khan film. After approval from a certain John Buchanan, of course.

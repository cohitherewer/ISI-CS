  Searches roll in Hyderabad          G.S. RADHAKRISHNA                            In the season of frauds, the sky is the limit. Marcus Schrenker, an American businessman based in Indiana and charged with financial fraud, parachuted out of his plane and allowed the aircraft to crash in what may have been an attempt to fake his own death. AP picture shows the crashed single-engine plane in Florida.                                       
	Hyderabad, Jan. 13: Investigators swooped down on the homes of top Satyam officials in upscale localities housing cyberabads aristocracy.         
	Fifteen teams from the state CID fanned out across the city to carry out search-and-seizure operations on the residences and offices of several Satyam directors and senior executives and the premises of PricewaterhouseCoopers, where the software companys auditor Price Waterhouse is housed.        
	CID chief V.S.K. Kaumudi confirmed the visits but did not give details. We cannot tell you how many places we are visiting, maybe roughly 10 to 15. But all of that is not a raid, it is only a search-and-seizure operation. We are also going to question some former directors and employees, he said.        
	Amid the investigations, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh met senior cabinet ministers. Sources said as an immediate step, the government was readying a line of credit of around Rs 500 crore for working expenses from banks and financial institutions.         
	The Centre also appears to be pushing government IT projects to Satyam. BSNL has awarded a Rs 2,000-crore contract to the company. Sources in Satyam said the receivables as of date were around Rs 2,500 crore and the debts and payables were roughly around Rs 945 crore. All figures need to be authenticated in the light of the scandal.         
	The scanner was on Price Waterhouse, the auditing arm of PricewaterhouseCoopers, as a 15-member CID team arrived at its three-storey headquarters in Hitec City in the morning. They went in with the local head, S. Gopalakrishnan, who has been questioned for the last two days.        
	Police sources said documents, hard disks and laptops have been collected from the Price Waterhouse offices. A spokesman for the firm later explained that it was not a raid but only quizzing by the CID. We are in discussion with different agencies for providing information requested by them. We are fully cooperating with the agencies, he said.        
	Among those whose homes were visited by CID teams was Ram Mynampati, the former Satyam board member and interim CEO. However, Mynampati, who police sources said was an American citizen, has flown to the US, ostensibly to control the damage done to Satyams image.         
	Neighbours of Mynampati in the colony of tech czars in Hitec City  were each villa costs upward of Rs 1.2 crore  craned their necks to see what was happening as a fleet of police vehicles purred into the compound more used to seeing BMWs.

	One of the residents, the wife of a senior IT professional, was heard saying: Poor Ram, police called on his home. But he was not there. Similar jibes were doing the rounds in Hyderabads affluent neighbourhoods like Jubilee Hills, Emaar Villas, Banjara Hills and Chartered Accountants Colony, where police teams went around through the day.         
	At the quarters of M. Rammohan Rao on the campus of the Indian School of Business (ISB), authorities at first refused to allow the sleuths in. They later relented, but Rao, who resigned as the ISB dean and as an independent director of Satyam, was not to be found. Neither was he there at his apartment in Jubilee Hills, one of Indias most expensive stretches of real estate.         
	The CID also visited the house of some relatives of arrested chief financial officer Vadlamani Srinivas, who was tonight shifted to the prison barrack housing the Raju brothers.         
	The discredited siblings have asked the jailer for B-Class treatment, under which they can cook their own food and have their separate toilet. The jail authorities are yet to respond.        
	Satyam employees: Officials from the Registrar of Companies said the actual worldwide head count at Satyam could be around 36,000 and not 53,000 as projected by B. Ramalinga Raju.

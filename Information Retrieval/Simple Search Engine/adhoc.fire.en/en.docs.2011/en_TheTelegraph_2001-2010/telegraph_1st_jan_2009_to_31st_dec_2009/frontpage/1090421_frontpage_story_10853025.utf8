The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Big fight not with Cong: Lalu
                                                                                                           Big fight not with Cong: Lalu
  - Battle to make Manmohan our PM          SANKARSHAN THAKUR IN PATNA                              Sonia Gandhi, Manmohan Singh and Lalu Prasad (below)				                                             
	Railway minister and RJD chief Lalu Prasad has called a halt to slanging with the Congress over the demolition of the Babri Masjid and said he is embattled in the larger cause of installing Manmohan Singh as Prime Minister again.        
	Election mein toka-taki chalta hai (a bit of by-play happens in elections) but I have no differences with Manmohanji, we are fighting this battle to make him our Prime Minister, no front-frunt, only UPA, he said in an exclusive conversation with The Telegraph on Monday morning.         
	He sat, as ever, legs crossed on a rattan chair under a high prefab portico of wife Rabri Devis 10 Circular Road bungalow in west Patna. A long days night was behind him, but another day of chopper-stopping blazed ahead.        
	He was gearing up  a loud bout of hot-water gargling, a pinch of raw tobacco (khaini) tucked underlip to get his juices going, a gentle massage to his calves. Thakna nai hai! he said, as if to himself, Jang abhi baaki hai. (Cant afford to tire, the war is not done yet.)         
	But what he saw of the newspaper headlines as he sipped his first cup of tepid lemon tea didnt leave him pleased. Ladai lagwata hai sab, ek line bole hum aur pachas thho banner bana diya, bekar ka chill-poon, chill-poon. (They  he probably meant the media  create misunderstandings; I spoke one line and theyve turned that into fifty screaming banners, worthless prattle.) His gathering court of loyalists, among them former Bihar ministers Shyam Rajak and Anwar Ahmed, nodded agreeably.        
	Visibly perturbed that the Prime Minister had joined issue with him from Guwahati, Lalu Prasad said: I had only stated a fact of history, and that too in a particular context. And before I spoke of the Congress, I emphatically blamed the BJP for the demolition, why is such a big issue being made out of one comment? Hamara bada ladai Congress se nahin-naa hai, hamara bada ladai hai BJP se. (My big fight is not with the Congress, it is with the BJP.)         
	Asked whether he had spoken to the Prime Minister or Congress president Sonia Gandhi on the issue, Lalu Prasad said: No, but I do not see the need. All of us are busy campaigning, and there is complete trust between me, Soniaji and Manmohanji. They are both very sober and decent leaders, we have a good understanding.         
	That understanding didnt work in Bihar, though, and the Congresss decision to contest all 40 seats has left Lalu Prasad hurt. It would have been good if we all fought together, Lalu, (Ram Vilas) Paswan, Congress. We would have made a solid shield, but the Congress wanted too many seats, where is their base vote to meet such demands? Let the results come, we will see.        
	But he laid none of the blame for the rift on Sonia. She is a sober lady, he repeated. But she is surrounded by munshis and sahukars (accountants and petty traders), they have spoilt it all.        
	Even so, Lalu Prasad would not concede that the Congress would eat into his vote share  Where are their votes, do they even have enough credible candidates? But he did say being united would have sent a stronger political message. This is not a battle for Bihar, this is the battle for Delhi, please understand, we have a common enemy in the BJP to defeat.         
	He rubbished widely reported prospects of a drastic reduction in his 2004 Lok Sabha kitty with trademark contempt  he expelled his dose of khaini into the spittoon and said, Kuchh nahin. (Nothing doing). Then he took another sip of tea and said: The problem is the media think they know everything, the media are only confused, totally confused. Particularly electronic media. Khali bite-bite. (All they want is a bite) they are blowing up useless issues and leaving the real issues of poverty and underdevelopment aside. I am in full-time touch with the people, I know better, we will win hands down, keep watching.         
	But does it make him nervous that chief minister Nitish Kumar is running away with the development card and getting praise everywhere for work done? Does it worry him that some day soon, Nitish could replace him as the Congresss chief ally in Bihar? Huh! he scoffed, Sunte to hain ki deal ke koshish mein hain Nitish Kumar, lekin uu toh BJP ke god mein baithe hain aur sapna dekh rahe hain. (I too have heard he is trying for some deal with the Congress, but he is sitting in the BJPs lap and dreaming.) Laughter rippled around the court, growing fuller as the morning wore.        
	Nitish is a selfish individualist, a man without ideology or principles, he can do anything. Lalu Prasad carried on, spurred by the response: If it comes to promoting himself, he can make any compromise, he can sacrifice anything. Lalu makes no compromises on principles, that is why I am here today, but mark my words, I will be back. And I will do to Bihar what I have done with the railways.         
	He rose, then, and left to join the struggle that he knows he desperately needs to wage to remain on stage. Outside his high gates, the mornings trickle had turned into a hectic eddy of the faithful. Not the frenzied following he once had at his feet, but not a fools fancy either; some among them were yelling out allegiance anew. This man may not be out of business yet.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Swine flu in summer? Puzzling 
                                                                                                           Swine flu in summer? Puzzling

	New Delhi, May 3: Microbiologist Anice Lowen wonders how the swine flu virus that has spread to 19 countries is breaking the time-tested rules that have tied influenza outbreaks mainly to winters.        
	The answer may help scientists predict how this previously unknown strain of the flu virus that has raised the spectre of a pandemic might behave in the warm and humid conditions of India  if it arrives here.        
	Research by Lowen and her colleagues at the Mount Sinai School of Medicine, New York, last year suggested that flu viruses spread through air efficiently in cold and dry weather. Above 30C, they appear to spread mainly through contact with contaminated surfaces  making hand-washing even more important in hot and humid weather.        
	Her study indicated that flu epidemics in hot countries are fuelled by contact rather than through air. But this swine flu appears to be breaking rules, spreading in North America and Europe in late April, Lowen told The Telegraph.        
	The continuing spread of this virus is among key, unresolved puzzles that are hampering efforts to make scientific forecasts of how the virus will behave in the coming weeks and months, infectious disease experts said.        
	The biggest puzzle remains the striking differences in the severity of the flu in Mexico and all other countries where this strain of the H1N1 virus has surfaced.        
	Mexico has reported 19 deaths among 506 confirmed cases, and the child who died in Texas had come from Mexico. No other country has reported deaths.        
	Is there a difference in the virus or is it just the poorer healthcare facilities in Mexico? said Shahid Jameel, head of virology at the International Centre for Genetic Engineering and Biotechnology, New Delhi.        
	We may have to worry about this since we are more like Mexico in our healthcare systems and our preparedness.        
	Scientists at the US Centers for Disease Control (CDC) have cautioned that as more people are infected, the illness may show up with a range of symptoms, from mild ear infection to more severe infections, perhaps even leading to death.         
	Early studies on the new H1N1 virus suggest that it does not have the genetic signatures associated with virulence seen in the H1N1 strain that caused the 1918 flu pandemic, killing more than 40 million people world-wide.        
	However, theres a great deal we do not yet understand about the virulence of the 1918 virus or other influenza viruses that have severe clinical picture in humans, said Nancy Cox, the director of the CDCs influenza division.        
	There are many possible explanations of why swine flu may prove lethal for some patients and not for others. The virus may lose its lethality as it spreads from person to person, or the patients who died may have had something in common  such as a delay in receiving treatment or a particular line of treatment.        
	Most scientists agree the current outbreaks may have three possible outcomes.        
	We may see a pandemic, or the virus may disappear because it cannot adapt to humans, said Nigel Dimmock, a biologist at the University of Warwick, the UK. But it may also smoulder for years... until it changes and then bursts into a pandemic.

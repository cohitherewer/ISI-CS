	Washington, Nov. 23: A day before his summit meeting with Barack Obama at the White House, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh took an unusual step of giving some advice in public to the President on Afghanistan, an issue which is beginning to trouble the Obama presidency almost like Iraq effectively dismembered his predecessor George W. Bushs administration.        
	Using an opportunity to address Washingtons strategic community at a meeting organised jointly by the Council on Foreign Relations and the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars, the Prime Minister said: Democracy in an ancient land like Afghanistan will take time to take root and to come to terms with the countrys history and tribal traditions.        
	He boldly threw Indias weight publicly behind the embattled president of Afghanistan, Hamid Karzai. It is vitally important that all major regional and international players put their weight behind the government of Afghanistan.        
	Singh emphatically asserted that this is the only way that Afghanistan can meet the daunting challenges it faces.        
	An hour after the text of the Prime Ministers speech was distributed to the media with an embargo until delivery on its publication, there was an explosion of activity in the US state department.        
	Obamas special envoy on Afghanistan and Pakistan, Richard Holbrooke, hurriedly called an on-the-record, on-camera press conference with barely 90 minutes notice. At the time of writing, however, it was unclear what Holbrooke would say to the media.        
	The special envoy has been virtually blackballed by India which has declined to give him dates for a visit to New Delhi. Karzai has also been holding out against dealing with Holbrooke, who tried to unseat him through a backdoor regime change midway through the recent presidential election in Afghanistan.        
	Holbrooke has, however, endeared himself to Islamabad and he has been able to pick his protege to distribute the lucrative non-military aid being doled out to Pakistan by the Obama administration.        
	Indian officials will, however, lose little sleep over Holbrookes antics. It is well known in diplomatic circles here that the special envoy is increasingly isolated within the state department and that Obama has lately turned to Senator John Kerry and secretary of state Hillary Clinton to deal with Afghanistan and Karzai in particular.        
	Singh was anything but apologetic about an Indian role and an Indian presence in Afghanistan, which has been the subject of criticism from a section of the American government, the US army in particular.        
	India has enduring civilisational links with Afghanistan, the Prime Minister told the strategic community here. We do not see Afghanistan as a theatre of influence, he said in a thinly veiled criticism of Pakistan which insists that Afghanistan represents its strategic depth and, therefore, promotes its proxy, the Taliban.        
	India will continue to assist Afghanistan in building its institutions and its human resources, he asserted. The evolution of Afghanistan as a stable and moderate nation state is so vital for the region and the world.        
	But he also warned chicken hearts in the US who want Obama to pull out of Afghanistan that the road to peace in Afghanistan will be long and hard. Given the high stakes involved, the commitment of the international community must be sustained by firm resolve and unity of purpose.        
	The Prime Ministers unambiguous public assertions on Afghanistan a day before his summit with the President is a clear signal that New Delhi is irritated by the contours of Washingtons so-called AfPak policies, especially leaks here from the top levels of the US army that Pakistans fears about India are not to be ignored in Washington.        
	The Prime Minister told The Washington Post in an interview published on the day of his arrival here that Pakistan has nothing to fear from India.        
	Earlier, Singh endeared himself to the captains of US business by telling them that although he was meeting Obama only on Tuesday, he had arrived here earlier because today... belongs to the private sector and that American business has played a vital role in transforming the Indo-US relationship into what can today be called a strategic partnership between the two countries.        
	With the restraining presence of the Left on economic issues no longer holding back the UPA government, Singh told the US Chamber of Commerce and the US-India Business Council that economic reforms will continue. You should have no doubt on that score...We might do it gradually and in a manner which builds a consensus for change. But I assure you we will persevere.

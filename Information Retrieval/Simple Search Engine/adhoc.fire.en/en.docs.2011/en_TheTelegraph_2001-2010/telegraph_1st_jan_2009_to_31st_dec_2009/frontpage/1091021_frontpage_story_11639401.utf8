The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Backlash forces IIT clarification
                                                                                                           Backlash forces IIT clarification
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                               
	New Delhi, Oct. 20: Kapil Sibal today clarified that the Indian Institutes of Technology alone will decide on a proposed hike in their eligibility criteria, after Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar and several other politicians termed the proposal elitist.         
	A panel of representatives from all the IITs will recommend a set of entrance examination reforms, including any hike in eligibility criteria, the human resource development minister said.         
	After a meeting of the IIT Council, the minister had yesterday asserted that a hike in eligibility criteria was essential.        
	At present, students need to score at least 60 per cent in their Class XII board examinations to become eligible for an IIT seat. Sibal yesterday suggested that the cut-off be raised.         
	He had indicated that the new cut-off could limit eligibility to the top 10 to 15 percentile of students based on their school-leaving exam.               
	IIT sources and HRD ministry officials had dismissed the figure as unrealistic as it would bar 85 per cent students from sitting for the entrance examination.         
	The Bihar chief minister wrote to Sibal, saying that raising the eligibility criteria to allow just board toppers a chance at IIT seats was elitist. Such proposals will favour students with elite background and discriminate against students with poor socio-economic status. Any examination system should be inclusive, Nitish said in his letter.        
	Similar sentiments were expressed by Lalu Prasad and Ram Vilas Paswan  leaders from Bihar from where many aspirants take the IIT entrance test. Uttar Pradesh chief minister Mayavati, the BJP and the JMM also slammed the proposal  all smelling a design to deny seats to poor students and those from the hinterland.        
	Sibal today clarified that the figure he had mentioned as a possible new cut-off was just an example, and not what the IIT panel had decided on.         
	The team examining JEE reforms may, however, suggest a crucial departure from current admission practices where students are allotted a stream of engineering along with their seat  based on their rank in the entrance test.         
	This practice, the IITs feel, often leads to students picking a stream with preconceived notions and without adequate knowledge of whether they are suited to the subject.         
	Instead, the JEE reform team is considering a proposal to allot streams only at the end of the first year of undergraduate education.         
	This will not need any change in curriculum as all students at present study common subjects  involving physics, chemistry and mathematics  in the first year.

	Islamabad, Feb. 1 (PTI): Former Pakistan President Pervez Musharraf has been offered a job in Washington as Scholar-in-Residence on Pakistan at the Middle East Institute.        
	Musharraf, who had gone to the US last month for a lecture tour, attended a reception hosted by the institute.        
	The institutes head, former US ambassador to Pakistan Wendy Chamberlain, urged Musharraf to be the next Scholar-in-Residence on Pakistan.

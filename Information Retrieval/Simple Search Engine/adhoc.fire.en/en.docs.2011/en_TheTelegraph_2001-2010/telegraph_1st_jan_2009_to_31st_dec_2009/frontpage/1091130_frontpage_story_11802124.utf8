	Mumbai, Nov. 29 (PTI): Before a date or a job interview, take a long shower and invest in a good deodorant.        
	Smelling bad could make the girl run away or spoil that dream-job offer. A survey by the Mumbai-based Centre for Health and Hygiene has shown that more people have become aware that smelling good is as important as looking good.        
	Among respondents of both sexes in the 22-35 age bracket in Mumbai, Delhi, Hyderabad and Bangalore, body odour has emerged as the biggest cause for social embarrassment and low confidence level, director of the centre, Shankar Shinde, said.         
	Forty-one per cent of the respondents said overall cleanliness was the most important factor in personal hygiene, and 49 per cent respondents said body odour was the single most determinant of individual personal hygiene.        
	Forty-two per cent respondents said foul body odour was a personal stigma and should be avoided at all costs, Shinde added.        
	Most of them reacted to body odour strongly. Twenty-two per cent said they had a poor opinion of such people, 16 per cent said they avoided bad-smelling sorts, but only 8 per cent said they would let the person know about the problem.        
	While 43 per cent of the respondents attributed body odour to weather, some said the reason could be spicy food, stress, hormonal imbalance or hereditary factors, Shinde said. Shame, embarrassment, low self esteem, isolation, frustration, anxiety and depression are extremely common where body odour is present, he added.         
	For prevention, 55 per cent of the respondents said they bathed daily and maintained an overall healthy level of personal hygiene, while 45 per cent said they used deodorants.

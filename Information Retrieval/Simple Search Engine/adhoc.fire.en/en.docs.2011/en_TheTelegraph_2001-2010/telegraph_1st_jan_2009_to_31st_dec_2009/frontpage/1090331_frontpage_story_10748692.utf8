The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Cuttack seat trouble for BJD
                                                                                                           Cuttack seat trouble for BJD
          LALMOHAN PATNAIK                                    
	Cuttack, March 30: The scramble for BJD tickets from Barabati Cuttack and Choudwar Cuttack continues, as the party sits over its decision for the two new Assembly seats carved out of the earlier Cuttack city constituency.        
	The Congress has named its candidates for the two seats. BJP Cuttack city sitting MLA and former minister Samir Dey and state secretary Nayan Mohanty have started campaigning in Barabati Cuttack and Choudwar Cuttack, respectively, even as the party is yet to formally announce their names.        
	But the battlelines remain unclear with the BJD failing to clear the air over party candidates.        
	The BJD, which is finding it difficult to find a suitable candidate in the post-delimitation scenario, would be contesting the Assembly seats in Cuttack for the first time since it was formed after the death of Biju Patnaik in 1997. In the 2000 and 2004 elections, it had left Cuttack to the BJP.        
	The BJD is in a dilemma as Brahmananda Panda, the Lok Sabha MP from Jagatsinghpur, is looking for a nomination from Barabati Cuttack as his seat has been reserved for Scheduled Caste candidates.         
	Party sources said BJD strategist Pyarimohan Mohapatra is searching for suitable candidates to dispel the impression that the break-up in the alliance with the BJP had tilted the scale in favour of the Congress in an imminent triangular fight.        
	Another dilemma for the party is whether or not to select a minority candidate considering the high presence of Muslim voters. One choice is Syed Mustafiz Ahmed, the former minister who returned to the Biju Parivar after over a decade. The two other names doing the rounds were those of former chief minister Biren Mitras son Uttam Mitra and Gopal Krushna Mohanty, the chairman of Orissa State Bar Council.        
	In Choudwar Cuttack, at least three sitting BJD MLAs were looking for nominations.         
	Dharmananda Behera  the partys Cuttack district president and sitting MLA from Choudwar (the constituency has been abolished this time)  was one.         
	Pravat Biswal, the sitting MLA from Sadar Cuttack, has staked his claim as an SC candidate (the seat is reserved). The third contender was Pratap Jena, the sitting MLA from Kissanagar.

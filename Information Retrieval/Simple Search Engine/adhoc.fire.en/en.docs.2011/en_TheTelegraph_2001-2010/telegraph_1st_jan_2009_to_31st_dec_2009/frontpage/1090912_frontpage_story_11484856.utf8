  - HC lets off accused in Nithari murder case         OUR BUREAU                            Rimpa Haldars mother Dolly hurls a brick at Pandhers Noida home to protest the acquittal of the businessman accused of being involved in her daughters murder. (PTI)                                        
	Sept. 11: Allahabad High Court today acquitted businessman Moninder Singh Pandher in a Nithari murder case in which he had been sentenced to death, accepting the CBI stand that servant Surender Koli alone was guilty.        
	The court upheld the death sentence handed to Koli for murdering Rimpa Haldar, 14, one of the 19 children and young women whose dismembered skeletons were found in the drain of Pandhers Noida home in December 2006.        
	There is no evidence on record against him (Pandher), a bench said. It appears the sessions judge reckoned with (his) lascivious habit of bringing in call girls. A moral conviction cannot amount to a legal conviction.        
	The high court clarified that its judgment would not affect the decisions in the other five cases pending against the businessman. But Pandhers lawyer was confident the verdict will impact the rest of the Nithari cases and said she would seek bail for her client.        
	The CBI had given clean chits to Pandher, 52, in all the 16 cases where it had filed charge-sheets, and said he was in Australia when Rimpa was murdered. But the Ghaziabad trial court summoned Pandher on its own and made him a co-accused in six cases, saying he could not have been unaware of what went on at his home that should have stunk like a slaughterhouse.        
	Rimpas family plans to appeal in the Supreme Court.

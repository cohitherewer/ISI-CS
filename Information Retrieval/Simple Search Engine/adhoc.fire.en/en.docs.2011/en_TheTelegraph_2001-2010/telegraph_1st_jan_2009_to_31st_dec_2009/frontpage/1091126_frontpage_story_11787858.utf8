  - Low turnout in city pockets, first phase polling peaceful          OUR BUREAU                             An elderly voter goes back home after exercising her franchise at Nayasarai in Hatia on Wednesday. Picture by Prashant Mitra                                        
	Ranchi, Nov. 25: An average of 52 per cent turnout was recorded today in the Assembly elections, highlighting a clear divide between the way urban and rural areas voted in the first phase of polling despite a Maoist boycott call that did not have much of an impact in the state.        
	If the urban constituencies recorded relatively low turnouts, the rural areas defied the rebel boycott call and came out in larger numbers to usher in a new government that they hoped would provide Jharkhand with the stable leadership that it deserves.        
	Held against the backdrop of heightened security concerns, todays voting was peaceful barring sporadic incidents of tussles between candidates and supporters.         
	Polling percentage was between 41 to 45 per cent in most Assembly segments in and around the state capital Ranchi, Jamshedpur and the coal capital of Dhanbad.        
	But if the the overall percentage looked respectable at 52, though it was less than the 57 recorded in 2005, it was largely due to the turnout in the Assembly seats of Santhal Pargana, primarily an under-developed region.        
	Jharia registered the lowest polling percentage at 41, while Pakur, Maheshpur and Littipara stole the show with a maximum of 62 among the 26 seats of Santhal Pargana, Ranchi, Jamshedpur and Dhanbad regions that went to polls today.        
	Voting was completely peaceful in the first phase of polling, said a relieved V.H. Deshmukh, the state police spokesman. This was because adequate security arrangements were in place with air force helicopters used for surveillance in the polling areas, he added.        
	The enthusiasm among voters was lowest in urban areas. The poll percentages tell the story. If Kanke recorded a 44 per cent turnout, Jamshedpur East and Jamshedpur West saw only 45 per cent. It was 47 per cent in the Sindri Assembly seat.        
	But, Jugsalai, that encompasses major rural, Naxalite-hit areas like Patamda, registered a polling percentage of 57. As did voters in the 14 constituencies of Santhal Pargana who also came out in large numbers to cast their votes.         
	Some unruly incidents were reported from Poraiyahat Assembly segment under Godda district where JMM candidate Suraj Mandals bodyguards opened fire to quell an unruly mob of villagers.        
	An FIR has been lodged and one of the bodyguards suspended.         
	State joint chief electoral officer Ashok Kumar Sinha said they were satisfied with the way the polls went off. There are no reports of any major incident from any part of the state during the first phase of elections, he said.

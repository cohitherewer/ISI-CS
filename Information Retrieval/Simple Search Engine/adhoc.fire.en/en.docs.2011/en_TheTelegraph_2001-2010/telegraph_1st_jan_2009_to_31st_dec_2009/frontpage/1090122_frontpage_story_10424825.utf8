	Beijing, Jan. 21 (AP): The official Chinese translation of President Barack Obamas inauguration speech omitted his references to communism and dissent.        
	A live broadcast on state television also today quickly cut away to the anchor when sensitive topics were mentioned.        
	The comments by the newly installed President veered into politically sensitive territory for Chinas ruling Communist Party, which maintains a tight grip over the Internet and the entirely state-run media. Beijing tolerates little dissent and frequently decries foreign interference in its internal affairs.        
	At one point, Obama said earlier generations faced down communism and fascism not just with missiles and tanks, but with sturdy alliances and enduring convictions. He later addressed those who cling to power through corruption and deceit and the silencing of dissent  know that you are on the wrong side of history.        
	The Chinese translation of the speech, credited to the website of the official China Daily newspaper, did not contain the word communism in the first sentence. The paragraph with the sentence on dissent had been removed entirely. The censored version was carried by the state-run Xinhua News Agency and posted on popular online portals Sina and Sohu.         
	Another portal, Netease, used a version without the paragraph mentioning communism, but retaining the part about dissent. The news channel of state broadcaster China Central Television broadcast the speech live early morning local time, but appeared caught off-guard by the statement about facing down communism.        
	The translator had no sooner said fascism and communism when the audio faded out from Obamas speech and cameras cut back to the studio anchor, who seemed flustered for a second before turning to ask an expert what challenges the President faced in turning around the US economy.        
	Wang Jianhong, the deputy director of the CCTV general editing department, said he did not stay up to watch the inauguration broadcast but suggested the transition was a normal part of the programme.

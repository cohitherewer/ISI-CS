	Bhubaneswar, July 17: A CRPF jawan was killed in a landmine blast today while searching for a police team that was abducted by Maoists last night from the dense jungle of Jharbeda forest near Rourkela.        
	Todays search yielded the body of Koida police station sub-inspector Ajit Bardhan, 30, who was abducted last night while he was escorting a truck with explosives meant for local mining industry in Rourkela on NH 23.        
	The body of Bardhan, who is survived by his seven-month pregnant wife, was found from the dense forest of Jharbeda, about 55km from Rourkela.         
	Among the other four kidnapped last night, one cleaner and the poice vehicle driver are still missing and the rest were released.        
	He called me around 8.30 last night, asking what the doctor told me, said Muni, Bardhans wife who is seven-month pregnant, before breaking down.        
	Newspapers this morning only said that Bardhan and others had been kidnapped by the rebels. We were shell-shocked. I had decided to plead to the Maoists through the media to free him. I thought they might just take pity on me, said Muni, wailing inconsolably, as she realised that the Maoists had already killed her husband.        
	The rebels first opened fire at the driver of the explosives-laden vehicle  belonging to Soon after the truck was looted, the CRPF personnel and the police launched a combing operation in the area during which CRPF jawan Maohammed Rafiq (29) was hurt in a landmine explosion. He succumbed to his injuries on way to hospital later, Sundargarh superintendent of police Diptesh Patnaik said.         
	The truck driver, Trinath Sahoo, who suffered serious bullet injuries, has been sent to Rourkela Ispat Hospital.        
	This year, 11 state police officers, one CRPF jawan and 11 CISF personnel have been killed in Naxalite attacks.         
	Nine policemen were killed in a Maoist landmine blast at Palur in Koraput district on June 18, while 11 CISF jawans laid down their lives during an encounter with the rebels, who attacked Asias biggest bauxite mines at Damanjodi in Koraput district on April 12.         
	The rebels had blown up two police stations and one outpost in Koraput district on June 7 night.         
	However, there was no casualty in the incident.         
	On June 15, a police sub-inspector Narasingh Mahakud was killed during an encounter with the Maoists in Sambalpur district.         
	The rebels also killed four civilians this year suspecting them as police informers. They had also killed a candidate before the Assembly polls in April.

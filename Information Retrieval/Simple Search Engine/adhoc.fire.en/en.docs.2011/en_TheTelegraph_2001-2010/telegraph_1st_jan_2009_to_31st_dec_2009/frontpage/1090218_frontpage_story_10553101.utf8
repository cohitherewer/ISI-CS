The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Tests suggest rape: Official 
                                                                                                           Tests suggest rape: Official 
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Calcutta, Feb. 17: Preliminary reports of two medical examinations on a 21-year-old student of a private engineering college in the city have indicated that the girl was raped, said an officer investigating the case.         
	The first examination was conducted on the girl, who was allegedly raped by three young men on February 8 and February 9, in Malda District Hospital on Friday. She underwent another test at MR Bangur Hospital yesterday.         
	We are yet to get the full reports but we have the preliminary findings of the tests. Both the tests have indicated that she was raped as the doctors found signs of extreme torture, said the official on condition of anonymity.         
	The girl, a third-year engineering student, had complained that Rishin Sengupta, Tanmoy Mayukh Borai and Saptarshi Sanyal repeatedly raped her after calling her over for a get-together and drugging her.         
	The girl returned to Malda on February 9 but came back to Calcutta on Sunday and lodged a complaint against the three.         
	The trio, students of reputable colleges in the city, were arrested on the basis of the complaint. Alipore Court sent them to judicial custody till March 2.         
	According to the officer, mention of the torture signs in the two medical reports will help establish the assault as rape. If convicted, the youths can be sentenced for life.         
	We will produce the medical examination reports and details of our investigations at the next hearing of the case, said the official.         
	Besides getting in touch with the family members of the three young men, the police are also talking to their friends and checking their antecedents.         
	We got very little time to interrogate them as they were sent to judicial custody the next day. But one of the boys told us that there were some other people in the flat on that night. They might not be directly involved in the rape as the girl has mentioned only three names. But we are looking for them as part of the investigation, added the officer.         
	The police are yet to record the statement of the girl. She is still traumatised. So, we will talk to her after a few days, record her statement and produce it in the court.         
	A close relative of the girl told The Telegraph that her condition had improved marginally in the last 24 hours but she was not in a position to talk.         
	We are trying our best to get her out of the state of depression and help her in fighting the case, said the relative with whom the girl and her mother are staying.

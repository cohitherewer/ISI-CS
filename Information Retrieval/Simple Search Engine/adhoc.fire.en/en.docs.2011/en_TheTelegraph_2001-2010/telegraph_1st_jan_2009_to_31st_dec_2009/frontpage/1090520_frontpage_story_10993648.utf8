          RASHEED KIDWAI                              
	New Delhi, May 19: One of Manmohan Singhs first tests as second-time Prime Minister will be staving off ally pressure for important ministries.        
	Sources said Singh was keen to build a team of his choice but the allies were demanding specific portfolios, including key infrastructure ministries where the Prime Minister hoped to tone up performance and enforce accountability.        
	M. Karunanidhi, who met Sonia Gandhi and Singh today, handed in six names, four of whom are from the DMK chiefs extended family. The list includes the Tamil Nadu chief ministers son M. Azhagiri, daughter Kanimozhi, great-nephew Dayanidhi Maran and Azhagiris sister-in-law Helen Davidson.        
	Karunanidhi apparently wants cabinet rank for Azhagiri and independent charge of a ministry for Kanimozhi, who is from the Rajya Sabha.        
	The sources said Singh was keen to drop two DMK ministers, T.R. Baalu and A. Raja, who had faced corruption allegations during the previous governments tenure. DMK sources said Karunanidhi was willing to dump Raja but was still trying to retain Baalu.        
	However, even if Baalu is left out, Karunanidhi is likely to insist that his replacement be from the DMK, and that the party retain all the ministries it held.        
	Mamata Banerjee is being seen as the most reasonable and accommodating ally. Sources close to Singh expressed delight at the manner in which the Trinamul Congress chief, who has said she will not haggle for berths, had conducted herself so far.        
	Indications are that her party would be offered railways as well as food and civil supplies. The Congress is also willing to consider berths for Trinamul MPs as ministers of state in ministries earlier held by Lalu Prasads RJD.        
	Lalu Prasads isolation in the UPA was complete today when Railway Protection Force guards were withdrawn from his Patna residence.        
	The National Conferences Farooq Abdullah is said to be eyeing tourism and culture or the information and broadcasting ministry.        
	The sources said Singh wanted to tweak some ministries. He wants the commerce and industry ministry to be split into two. He is not keen on ministers occupying dual charge, such as shipping and surface transport, they said.        
	Singh is said to be keen to draft M. Veerappa Moily, Kishore Chandra Dev, Salman Khursheed, Mallikarjuna Kharge and Shashi Tharoor into the new ministry.         
	The Congress is also considering a proposal to offer deputy speakership to the Janata Dal (United), an NDA ally that could eventually close ranks with the UPA.

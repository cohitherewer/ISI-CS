	Ranchi, April 19: Narendra Singh Dhoni, the brother of M.S. Dhoni, joined the BJP today, taking politics to the drawing room of Indian crickets first family.        
	Talking to reporters, Narendra said he was inspired by his namesake who is at the helm of Gujarat politics. I would have joined the BJP the day Gujarat chief minister Narendra Modi came to town campaigning for Ramtahal Choudhary, the partys nominee in Ranchi. Unfortunately, I fell sick and was confined to bed. Today, I took the plunge, he said.        
	Pledging to serve the interest of the BJP and Jharkhand, 38-year-old Narendra said that L.K. Advani was his idol and that he would fully devote himself to follow his ideals.         
	Elder of the two brothers, Narendras first love is football. He had played in the DAV national football meet and also in the Subroto Cup.         
	However, with his younger sibling at the cricket centre stage, Narendra took interest in cricket too.        
	After doing his matriculation from Jawahar Vidya Mandir, Shyamali, Narendra completed intermediate from Ranchi College and graduated from Indira Gandhi National Open University.         
	On why he decided to join the BJP, Narendra reiterated that he was quite impressed by Modis performance in the western state and wanted to replicate his development model in Jharkhand.         
	With Atal Behari Vajpayee and Advani in its ranks, I find the BJP as the perfect platform from where I can work for the people.        
	On whether he had a word with his brother over joining politics, Narendra said: I have discussed my plans with my family. Mahi knew it.        
	Though Dhoni is known to be close to Ajsu chief and former state home minister Sudesh Mahto, his brother claimed that he, too, had been a BJP supporter since 1991. He, however, declined to comment on whether Dhoni would join politics too. He is preoccupied with cricket, the elder brother said.        
	Narendra said he had not thought of contesting the Assembly elections.         
	I have just joined the BJP and my priority is to serve the party in whatever way I can. At present, I will only campaign for Choudhary, he added.        
	In the evening, he addressed a public meeting at Dhurwa, considered the stronghold of Congress nominee from Ranchi Subodh Kant Sahay.

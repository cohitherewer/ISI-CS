  - Yuki aces junior singles           JAYDEEP BASU                            Yuki on Saturday. (AP)                                        
	New Delhi, Jan. 31: Yuki Bhambri wanted a Grand Slam trophy in his drawing room but had prepared himself for a long wait.        
	The 16-year-old proved himself wrong. In fact, he didnt even have to wait an hour.        
	The Delhi boy took just 57 minutes to wrap up the match and become the first Indian to clinch the Australian Open junior singles title.        
	The easy 6-3, 6-1 win over German Alexandros-Ferdinandos Georgoudas lit up Indias day before Mahesh Bhupathi flattered to deceive in the mens doubles final.        
	But it was Yukis moment under the sun at Melbourne today.        
	After the match, the first thing he did was call his parents back home. I was aware it was early morning in India but knew that everyone in my family was following my match, said the new star. So, after I went to the locker room, the first thing I did was talk to my parents.        
	In Delhi, proud mom Indu Bhambri said theirs was a tennis family.        
	His two sisters, Ankita and Sana, and cousin Prerna are all national-level tennis players, she said. Ours is a kind of tennis family.        
	A source in the Delhi Lawn Tennis Association said credit should also go to Yukis father Chandra, a surgeon.        
	He has spent a fortune on Yuki, said the source. Because of him, Yuki could hone his skills at the Nick Bollettieri Tennis Academy in the US.        
	The academy has trained players like Agassi, Becker, and the Williams sisters.        
	Yuki said winning the title was a very big achievement, a dream come true. Asked how it felt to be the first Indian to win the trophy, he said he wasnt aware of this piece of history. When someone told me about it, I was quite surprised.        
	Only three other Indians have won a tennis junior Grand Slam singles title  Ramanathan Krishnan (Wimbledon 1954), Ramesh Krishnan (Wimbledon and French Open in 1979) and Leander Paes (Wimbledon 1990 and US Open 1991).        
	Like all budding tennis players, I too wanted to have a Grand Slam trophy in my drawing room, Yuki said after his win. Frankly, I never thought it would come so soon.        
	The triumph also put his name alongside those of players like Andy Roddick and Marcos Baghdatis, both former Australian Open junior champions who have made it big in the mens circuit.        
	Yuki said he would now focus on graduating to the senior league. I had already planned to focus more on mens tournaments, he said. Probably now I should test my skills against bigger opponents.        
	Mother Indu didnt forget to thank Yukis strength-and-coordination trainer Ramkumar. He has been working with Yuki for the past one year. Under him, Yuki has made great improvement, she said.        
	Ramkumar, a former athlete from Tamil Nadu, said it was diet that made all the difference  six meals a day and grilled or boiled chicken and mutton.        
	He might have added minced, given the score line.

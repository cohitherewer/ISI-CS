	Kurseong, Jan. 2: More than 500 supporters of the Gorkha Janmukti Morcha protesting against the murder of their leader Subodh Pradhan snatched the five accused from a police van and beat them up, leaving four of them seriously injured.         
	The fifth, Rajen Senchuri, managed to flee the mob. Nirmal Diyali, Bikash Diyali, Krishnabahadur Diyali and Bimal Diyali were sent to North Bengal Medical College and Hospital in Siliguri for treatment after they were produced in court.         
	The four were hardly conscious and had to be bodily lifted and taken before the subdivisional judicial magistrate who remanded them in judicial custody and set January 27 as the next date of hearing.         
	Subodh Pradhan, the Morcha convener from Pankhabari-Giddhapahar, had been beaten to death by a mob around 1am yesterday at a DGHC rest house in Rohini, 45km from here. He along with six others had broken the lock to enter the bungalow. In retaliation, furious Morcha supporters set fire to the guest house along with 20 houses in Rohini in the afternoon. The murder accused had been arrested by then. Around 11am, Morcha supporters who had assembled near the Kurseong motor stand marched to the court when news reached them that the accused were being brought from Pradhannagar police station where they had been kept for the night.        
	The rallyists reached the court around 12.30pm, the same time as the police vehicle arrived with the accused. The van got stuck at the end of the procession. The mob went for the van, pelting it with stones and breaking the windscreen. Around 30 policemen tried to keep the crowd at bay, till some people got a chance to open the rear doors of the vehicle and drag out the five. Soon blows were raining on the prisoners, who were even attacked with sticks and khukuris.         
	Senchuri managed to flee the spot through an adjacent garden. The subdivisional police officer of Kurseong Rakesh Singh said: The four injured have been sent to NBMCH. The fifth, Rajen Senchuri, is missing. He said five policemen, including the inspector-in-charge of the Kurseong police station, suffered minor injuries.

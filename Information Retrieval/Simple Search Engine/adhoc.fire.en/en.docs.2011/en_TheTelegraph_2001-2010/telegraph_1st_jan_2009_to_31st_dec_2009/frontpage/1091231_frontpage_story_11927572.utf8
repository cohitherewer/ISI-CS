                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                Women: Fitting into old jeans beats sex
                                Trophy                             
	London, Dec. 30: More than a quarter of British women believe fitting into an old pair of jeans again would feel better than sex, according to research.        
	 More than a third (35 per cent) of those surveyed admitted owning a pair of trophy jeans they used to fit into and kept in the hope they would slim down enough to wear.        
	Asked how managing to put them back on would feel, 29.1 per cent said it would be better than sex, 28.9 per cent thought it would beat a promotion, 20.6 per cent believed it would top a best friends wedding, 20.3 per cent said it would feel better than a lottery win and 11.1 per cent thought it would beat a marriage proposal.        
	 The poll by cereal brand Special K also revealed that 30 per cent of women fantasised more about slimming back into their trophy jeans than about Hollywood heartthrobs such as George Clooney or Brad Pitt.        
	The survey showed that on average women own five pairs of jeans, with 10 per cent of women claiming their jeans have outlasted their longest relationship.        
	Laura Bryant, from Special K, said: Women hold a deep attachment to that one pair of jeans which they know they look and feel great in.        
	They use them as a benchmark and a great motivational tool when slimming and it doesnt matter how old the pair is. This research shows the sense of euphoria and the endorphin rush women get when they achieve their goal of fitting back into that one special pair of jeans is even better or on a par with some of the other great pleasures in life.        
	Opinions Matter surveyed 2,200 women online last month. A recent footwear survey showed that women treasured their old shoes more than their former lovers.

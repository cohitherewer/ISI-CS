The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Fall from pedestal
                                                                                                           Fall from pedestal
          SAMYABRATA RAY GOSWAMI                              
	Mumbai, March 31: Hours after the Supreme Court barred Sanjay Dutt from fighting elections, the leafy street outside his Pali Hill apartment was unusually quiet.        
	Hundreds would earlier rally outside the gates every time the actor had a date with the police or the courts. Today, there were no cheering crowds or broadcast vans, no praying sadhus or chanting fakirs.        
	Sanju and Maanyata are not here; I guess thats the reason, an aide to the actor said.        
	But a state Congress minister and family friend, who had stood by Sanjay through all his troubles till he joined the Samajwadi Party, had a different explanation.        
	Many who supported him in his dark days were ordinary Congress activists who felt an attachment because of Sunil Dutt saheb (and) then, as the brother of Priya. Today they feel betrayed by his association with the Samajwadis and have deserted him, he said.        
	It wasnt just the fans and Congress workers. Bollywood, which had hit the streets with placards when Sanjay first went to jail in 1993, too stayed aloof.        
	Those who had rallied behind him in 1993  his fathers friends  are not at the vanguard of the industry any more. In the last couple of years, the support of fans was more for Munnabhai than Sanjay. The industry support was driven more by commercial considerations than affection, a senior director said.        
	There were crores riding on him, which is not the case now. His decision to join politics was the last straw. People are wary; nobody wants to get caught in a political crossfire.        
	Others in the industry had a different take. The 26/11 attack has caused a sea change people are no more casual towards involvement in terror-related activities. He will find few supporters now, said an actor close to Sanjay who had earlier spoken in the stars support.        
	Lawyer and activist Y.P. Singh agreed. People in this city, especially the elite, have woken up to the need for untainted candidates to clean up the political system. This is a fallout of the public awakening following 26/11. Sanjay is suddenly a social untouchable, he said.        
	A source close to the Dutt family said Maanyata-Sanjays diatribes against Priya too had backfired.        
	Clinical psychologist Varkha Chulani said: Indians are quick to judge a man estranged from his family, especially when his wife is perceived as a gold digger. His sisters had stood by him but he made public statements against them with his wife. That would drive away his middle-class fans. He has also offended many by saying married women should not use their fathers surname.

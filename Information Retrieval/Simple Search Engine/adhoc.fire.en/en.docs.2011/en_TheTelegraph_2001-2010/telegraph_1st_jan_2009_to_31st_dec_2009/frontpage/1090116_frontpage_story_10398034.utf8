The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Directors, not dole, from govt 
                                                                                                           Directors, not dole, from govt 
  - Satyam looks at mortgage option        OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT      
	New Delhi, Jan. 15: Satyam Computer Services has got three more directors, not money, from the government, prompting the company to consider mortgaging assets.        
	The Centre today nominated to the companys board Tarun Das, the chief mentor of the Confederation of Indian Industry, T.N. Manoharan, a former president of the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (ICAI), and Suryakant Balakrishna Mainak, the chief of the investment division of LIC which holds 4 per cent stake in Satyam.        
	The three have expertise in corporate governance, accountancy and investments and add to the skill sets of the existing members  Deepak Parekh (finance), Kiran Karnik (technology) and C. Achuthan (corporate law).         
	The board is expected to meet in Hyderabad on Saturday to assess the financial requirements of the company.        
	But the government today said it would not give any direct bailout to Satyam. The company has not asked for any package, they may not need that. If they require, they will raise it from banks, corporate affairs minister Prem Chand Gupta said.        
	It is a private sector company. They (the board) have to work out how to finance the companys operations, Gupta added. The first impression from the directors is that its operations are sound and by and large major customers are willing to remain with the company.        
	Junior industry minister Ashwani Kumar did not mince words. This government is not going to directly or indirectly subsidise wrongdoing and fraud in Satyam.        
	Satyam senior executive Ram Mynampati, however, had sent an email to the economic affairs secretary, saying Rs 150 crore was required to meet the health insurance liabilities of employees in the US. We have received a mail or two from Mynampati. They indicated that they would need something of the order of Rs 150 crore..., economic affairs secretary Ashok Chawla said.        
	Board member Parekh said the company could raise funds by mortgaging assets. Until we know the real position, how can we speak of bailout? The company has receivables of Rs 1,700 crore, Parekh said, adding that financial assistance can be generated by hypothecating some of the assets of the company.        
	The bailout damper pulled the companys share down by 34 per cent to Rs 20.30  the level prevailing before the new board took charge.        
	Among the new members, Das, who studied in Calcutta and has a long association with industry chambers, also serves on the board of Haldia Petro. He is expected to help Karnik mobilise support from global and domestic clients.        
	Manoharan, who has some 23 years experience, is the author of a peer review manual for the ICAI and is highly regarded. Mainak is expected to act as the bridge between Satyam and financial institutions.

          JAYANTH JACOB                             Achuthanandan                                  
	New Delhi, July 11: The CPM is preparing to remove V.S. Achuthanandan from the politburo but is likely to let him continue as Kerala chief minister in a two-pronged approach that gives primacy to party discipline while addressing concerns expressed by a section of the politburo, including the Bengal camp.        
	If the central committee, which will resume its meeting tomorrow, sticks to this plan and initiates action against the veteran, it will mean that general secretary Prakash Karat has had his way in cracking down hard on what the party feels is indiscipline.        
	However, if Achuthanandan is retained as chief minister, it will also mean that the party has taken into account the cautionary opinion conveyed by seven of the 15 politburo members, including Bengal chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee.        
	The retention will reflect the CPMs misgivings in playing too much with public sentiment  Achuthanandan is popular in Kerala though he has lost his clout in the party organisation ---- at a time it has suffered a debacle in the Lok Sabha polls.        
	But that will not minimise the sweep of the snub to Achuthanandan, the oldest CPM member after special invitee Jyoti Basu.        
	Sources told The Telegraph the politburo had recommended to the central committee that it had not found credence in the corruption charges against his arch-rival Pinarayi Vijayan, striking at the root of the chief ministers case against the state CPM secretary.        
	There was a hint of action also against Vijayans camp. One of two notes circulated in the central committee  which met to try and end party infighting in Kerala  blamed the top leadership for the factionalism. The reference is to the Vijayan-Achuthanandan feud that led both to be temporarily suspended from the politburo two years ago.        
	The other note says Achuthanandan had failed to furnish evidence against Vijayan. The chief ministers charges relate to contracts awarded to Canadian company SNC Lavalin when Vijayan was Kerala power minister in 1996-98, over which the CBI has filed a corruption case. Achuthanandans stand goes against the CPMs position that the case against Vijayan is politically motivated, thus constituting indiscipline.        
	There is no evidence (that) Vijayan has derived any pecuniary benefit, the note says, adding that Achuthanandan has stated he has no evidence to present other than what is contained in the CBI and CAG reports. It says the CBI report doesnt produce any evidence of personal gain, monetary or otherwise. Nor does it make any such charge.        
	Achuthanandan is also accused of speaking in public about cabinet discussions.

	Dec. 29: An earthquake of moderate intensity hit many parts of the Northeast today, rattling windowpanes and shaking highrises on a lazy winter afternoon.         
	No loss of life or property was reported but the nearly 10-second quake, measuring 5.5 on the Richter scale, shook people out of their mid-afternoon slumber and sent those in offices scurrying outside for safety at 2.32pm.         
	An official at the Central Seismological Observatory in Upper Shillong said the earthquake had its epicentre on the Myanmar-Manipur border and was felt in many parts of Assam, Meghalaya and Manipur.         
	In Assam, the tremors were felt as far as in Jorhat in Upper Assam and Tezpur on the north bank of the Brahmaputra. Officials of the disaster management cell of the state government said no damage to property or loss of life had been reported.         
	The Shillong centre has recorded as many as 43 earthquakes, including minor tremors, this year. Todays was the first to be registered this month.         
	Concerned over the frequent earthquakes, Meghalaya is contemplating setting up emergency operating centres in the districts.         
	An official with the directorate of civil defence and homeguards in Meghalaya today said the preparedness level of homeguards had improved after a series of mock drills. The tremors were felt in Imphal and most parts of the state, too, but there was no report of any damage.

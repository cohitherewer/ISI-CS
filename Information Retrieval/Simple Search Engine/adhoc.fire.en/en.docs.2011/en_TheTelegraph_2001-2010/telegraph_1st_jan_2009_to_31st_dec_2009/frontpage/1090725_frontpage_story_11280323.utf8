          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                            Jagdish Tytler                                  
	New Delhi, July 24: Delhi Congress leader and former MP Jagdish Tytler has been pulled out of near-oblivion and given party work in what looks like the first step towards his rehabilitation.        
	He was put in charge of Bihar, without a formal designation. He will be inducted into the Congress Working Committee (CWC), the partys top policy-making body in which all those who look after states are enlisted as members.        
	Bihar was left without a minder after Iqbal Singh, a national secretary, was appointed the Pondicherry governor.        
	However, Tytlers comeback of sorts has evoked mixed reactions in the Congress. Some feel he has been punished enough for his alleged role in instigating the 1984 violence against Sikhs and ought to return to the centre stage.        
	Tytler was given a ticket from Delhi in the Lok Sabha elections. But a Sikh journalist protested the move by flinging his shoe at P. Chidambaram at a news conference. Tytler was then asked to withdraw his nomination.        
	Congress sources had feared Tytler might sabotage the chances of J.P. Aggarwal, who replaced him. But Tytler  described as a quintessential Gandhi family loyalist  belied their apprehensions by co-operating with Aggarwal and ensuring his win.         
	 His detractors felt that Bihar was an inappropriate and an unfortunate choice because of the sanctity that the Takht Sri Darbar, in Patna Sahib, holds for the Sikhs.        
	Congress leaders can apologise a million times on his behalf but his sins cannot be washed away, said a Sikh member of the partys minorities cell.

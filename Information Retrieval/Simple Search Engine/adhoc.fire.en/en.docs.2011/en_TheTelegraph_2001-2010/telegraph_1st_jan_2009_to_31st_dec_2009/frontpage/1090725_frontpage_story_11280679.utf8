          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                               
	Ahmedabad, July 24: Gujarat High Court today cleared the decks for a preliminary probe into Narendra Modis role in the 2002 riots dismissing a plea seeking a stay on the special investigation team quizzing the chief minister.        
	Justice D.H. Waghela dismissed the petition filed by Kalu Maliwad, a former BJP legislator, calling it ill-founded and misconceived.        
	Maliwad had challenged the Supreme Court order asking the SIT to look into a complaint by Zakia Jafri, wife of former Congress MP Ehsaan Jafri, who was among 39 killed in Gulbarg Society in Ahmedabad in 2002.        
	But Justice Waghela said: It is clear from reading of the apex court order that it contains a direction for (the) SIT and it will take any step required so as to give its report to the apex court.

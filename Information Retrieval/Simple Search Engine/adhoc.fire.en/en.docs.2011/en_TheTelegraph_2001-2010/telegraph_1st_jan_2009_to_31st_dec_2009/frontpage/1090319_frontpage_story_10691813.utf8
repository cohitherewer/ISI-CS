	London, March 18: Actress Angelina Jolie reportedly slapped her beau actor Brad Pitt after she caught him rubbing the back of a female employee, according to media reports.        
	Pitt is said to have been comforting the nanny after she was taken ill. However, the sight was enough to throw Jolie into a jealous rage and she allegedly slapped her partner across the face and immediately fired the nanny, the Daily Mail tabloid said quoting the Star magazine.        
	She got right in Brads face, screaming at the top of her lungs, and told the nanny to get out of her house and never come back. The argument woke up the sleeping twins, who began to cry, a source was quoted as saying.        
	As Brad tried to console both the twins and the nanny, Angie just snapped  and slapped!  hitting him right across the face, the source added. Pitt was reportedly left stunned by the act and stormed out of the couples home. He later went for a four-hour motorbike ride to calm down.        
	 Its alleged the argument took place days after they appeared together at the Academy Awards. However, the pairs representative has so far not responded to the reports.        
	The couple, who fell in love filming Mr amp; Mrs Smith while Brad was still married to actress Jennifer Aniston, have been together for three years.         
	Wanted ad banned        
	A television advert for the Jolie action film Wanted, also starring James McAvoy, has been banned after the industry watchdog ruled it could glamorise violence. Jolie was shown firing a bullet towards the viewer during the advert which quoted press reviews of the film describing her performance as blazingly sexy.         
	The actress was shown kissing co-star McAvoy who was also seen firing a gun during the advert which included car chase and a voice-over describing Wanted as the coolest movie of the year.         
	The Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) ruled that the advert gave the overall impression that using guns was sexy and glamorous and breached the code for television.         
	We concluded the ad could be seen to condone violence by glorifying or glamorising the use of guns, its adjudication said.         
	The advert for the DVD release of Wanted had been restricted from being shown at times when young children were likely to be watching but the ASA concluded that was insufficient.         
	Universal Pictures was told the advert must not be broadcast again in its current form.         
	But the studio hit back and said some people did not like to see a woman in a strong lead role.         
	Universal told the ASA the advert reflected that the 18 certificate film and was based on a comic book where superhuman heroes lived in a fantastical world.         
	Universal said the line the coolest movie of the year had been used in other adverts that included guns and high speed chases, without complaint.         
	Clearcast, which approves television adverts for broadcast, said it did not believe the advert encouraged or glamorised the use of guns. It told the ASA it believed viewers would draw the distinction between guns in a fantasy setting and in a more realistic depiction of crime in an urban setting.         
	The ASA received just one complaint about the advert.                    PTI AND THE DAILY TELEGRAPH

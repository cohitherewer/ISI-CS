The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Red Letter Day for US, Iran
                                                                                                           Red Letter Day for US, Iran
          MARK LANDLER                            Holbrooke (top), Akhondzadeh: Staying in touch                                 
	The Hague, April 1: It was brief, it was unscheduled and it was not substantive, but a meeting yesterday between Richard C. Holbrooke, a US presidential envoy and an Iranian diplomat marked the first face-to-face encounter between the Barack Obama administration and the government of Iran.        
	US secretary of state Hillary Clinton confirmed that Holbrooke, the administrations special representative for Afghanistan and Pakistan, greeted Irans deputy foreign minister, Mohammad Mehdi Akhondzadeh, on the sidelines of a major conference here devoted to Afghanistan.        
	It was cordial, unplanned and they agreed to stay in touch, Hillary said to reporters at the end of the conference. I myself did not have any direct contact with the Iranian delegation.        
	Hillary also said the US handed the Iranian delegation a letter requesting its intercession in the cases of two American citizens who are being held in Iran and another who is missing.        
	These two American contacts with Iran are another step in the Obama administrations policy of engagement. It is a tentative process, in which the White House makes symbolic gestures, like Obamas recent video greeting to the Iranian people and government for their New Year, while continuing to formulate its longer-term strategy.        
	Some officials, including Hillary, are sceptical that Irans leaders will ever embrace the American overtures. But reaching out, analysts say, keeps Iran on the defensive by demonstrating to the Europeans, the Russians and others that the US is sincerely trying. And talking about Afghanistan is easier than confronting more divisive issues, especially Irans nuclear ambitions.        
	For weeks, American officials regarded this conference as a good place to make a move. The delivery of the letter, along with Holbrookes greeting during a lunch break, suggested that the encounter was less than pure serendipity.        
	Hillary also reacted warmly to remarks delivered by Akhondzadeh about what Iran would do to aid reconstruction in Afghanistan and to cooperate in regional efforts to crack down on the booming Afghan drug trade, which is spilling across the Iranian border.        
	The fact that they came today, that they intervened today, is a promising sign that there will be future cooperation, she said. The Iranian representative set forth some very clear ideas that we will all be pursuing together.

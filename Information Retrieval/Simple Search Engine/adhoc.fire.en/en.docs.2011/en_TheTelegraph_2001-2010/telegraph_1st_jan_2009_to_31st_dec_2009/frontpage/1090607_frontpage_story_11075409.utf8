          IMRAN AHMED SIDDIQUI                               
	Gosaba, June 6: Manotosh Mondal, 36, worked 12 hours a day the past one week, helping repair embankments along the Durgaduani river to shield his three-bigha farmland against tomorrows spring tide.        
	The resident of Bijoynagar village gave up this morning, packed his clothes and took a mechanised boat to Gosaba to save himself and his family from the bhara kotal, expected to hit the Aila-ravaged Sunderbans at full pelt tomorrow morning.        
	Several hundred others, their villages still flooded after the May 25 cyclone, too left in search of safer places after water rushed in again from 10.30 this morning, heralding the spring tides impending arrival.        
	We tried our best but could not fully repair the embankments in such a short time. This morning, water began entering our village, said Manotosh, who lost his home in the cyclone.        
	During spring tides, which arrive every full moon and new moon, water levels in the Sunderbans rivers rise up to 5m (16.5 feet), about half a metre higher than during ordinary high tides, said A.K. Bagchi, director (marine department), Calcutta Port Trust. The water can rise higher in the narrower creeks.        
	Ordinarily, the embankments provide protection, but Aila has swept away over 900km of the Sunderbans 3,500km-long line of embankments. If the cyclone left Manotosh homeless, the bhara kotal threatens his livelihood.        
	We cant cultivate our land if it gets flooded by saline water. It would take at least two to three monsoons before I can grow three crops a year again, Manotosh said, explaining why he had stayed back at a relief camp to help repair the embankments before the full moon tonight.        
	Khalil Ahmed, South 24-Parganas district magistrate, said: This morning, water rose by four to five feet and entered some villages.        
	A block official in Gosaba said the water rushed in from 110 different breaches in the embankments, flooding at least 10 villages, including Bijoynagar, Satjelia, Amteli, Kumirmari, Lahiripur and Kochukhali.        
	Although people are fleeing, the district administration has not begun evacuation, waiting for a last-minute reprieve. Gosaba block development officer Amiya Bhushan Chakraborty spoke of a ray of hope.        
	The water hasnt yet risen to the levels we were expecting. How strong the spring tide is will be clear tomorrow morning, he said. If the water rises by 12 to 15 feet, well have to evacuate people.        
	The administration has alerted the army and the BSF and arranged for speedboats and hovercraft for rescue operations. But the villagers are wiser after Aila.        
	The authorities could not save us last time. Why should we depend on them? We fled the village on our own, said Abdul Qazi, a Kumirmari resident.        
	Manotosh has another grouse. Chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee had visited the Sunderbans last Sunday and urged villagers to join the embankment repair work, his government dangling the carrot of a daily wage of Rs 81 and food.        
	I worked seven days but got only Rs 200 (Rs 28 per day), Manotosh said. But my biggest worry is, what will happen to our farmland after the bhara kotal strikes?        
	The evening weather forecast provided some relief. G.C. Debnath, director, Alipore Met office, said the low-pressure system over the northwest Bay of Bengal was disintegrating. We dont expect heavy rain in the coastal areas in the next 48 hours.        
	However, experts have warned that tidal waves between June 22 and 25 could push water levels over 5.6m (18.4ft) because the moon would come to its perigee (closest position to Earth) coinciding with the new moon.

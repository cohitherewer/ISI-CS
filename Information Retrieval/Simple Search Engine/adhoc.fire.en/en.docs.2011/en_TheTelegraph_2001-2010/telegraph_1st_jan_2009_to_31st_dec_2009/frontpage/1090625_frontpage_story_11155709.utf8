                                                                                                           Undefended, Sarabjit fate in Zardari hands 
          GAJINDER SINGH AND NASIR JAFFRY                                Sarabjit; wife Sukhpreet Kaur in Amritsar. (PTI)				                                 
	Chandigarh/Islamabad, June 24: Former Pakistan rights minister Ansar Burney has decided to approach President Asif Ali Zardari for mercy after the countrys top court threw out death-row convict Sarabjit Singhs review petition, though there was no lawyer to defend him.         
	The Ansar Burney Welfare Trust International will file a mercy petition after the supreme courts verdict upholding Sarabjits death sentence, Burney told The Telegraph from London. The petition will be filed soon.        
	The court, which started hearing the review case on Monday, rejected Sarabjits plea after his counsel Rana Abdul Hamid, an additional advocate general for the Punjab government, failed to turn up.        
	I could not attend the hearing nor get any other lawyer to represent Sarabjit in court because of my government job. It is ironic that my contract expires today. But I will file a petition seeking to restore the review petition very soon, Hamid said from Lahore.        
	In Bhikhiwind near Amritsar, Sarabjits family appealed to Delhi to work with Islamabad for the release of the 43-year-old, convicted on charges of espionage and masterminding bomb blasts in several Pakistani cities that killed 14 persons in 1990.        
	I appeal to the Indian and the Pakistani governments that my husband is innocent. The time he has spent in Pakistan surpasses a life sentence. If the Indian government puts pressure, he can be saved, Sarabjits wife Sukhpreet told PTI.        
	Late in the evening, India again urged Islamabad to take a sympathetic and humanitarian view. Sarabjit Singhs case has touched the sentiments of many people in India. We have consistently urged the government of Pakistan to take a sympathetic and humanitarian view in this case. It is our hope that they will find it possible to do so, PTI quoted foreign minister S.M. Krishna as saying.        
	In the court today, a three-judge bench observed that after having read the case, we have reached a conclusion that there are no grounds necessitating a review, upholding a 2006 verdict of death.        
	Sarabjit was to have been hanged on April 1, 2008, but former President Pervez Musharraf had delayed the hanging for an indefinite period after Delhi approached Islamabad and sought clemency.         
	Burney, instrumental in the release last year of Kashmir Singh, an Indian who spent 35 years in Pakistani jails, lashed out at Pakistan supreme court chief justice Iftikhar Chaudhry for rejecting the petition without representation by a lawyer. The chief justice had loitered on the streets howling about human rights after he was removed, he said, alluding to Chaudhrys road protest after his ouster by Musharraf.        
	 Today, he has upheld a death sentence without hearing the petitioner. This is nothing but murder of justice and must not be allowed. The decision has been made against a non-Muslim and not against a convict.        
	Legal experts in Pakistan said Sarabjit had already spent 19 years in Pakistani jails and can now be freed under Pakistani laws.        
	In Bhikhiwind, Sarabjits sister Dalbir Kaur said Hamid had promised them over the phone that he would send another lawyer to the court. It is strange he failed to do so.        
	Dalbir and Sarabjits daughters Swapandeep and Poonam are planning to meet the Prime Minister, Sonia Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi. He crossed over to Pakistan by mistake, Swapandeep said. He is not a spy. Is there anyone listening to us?

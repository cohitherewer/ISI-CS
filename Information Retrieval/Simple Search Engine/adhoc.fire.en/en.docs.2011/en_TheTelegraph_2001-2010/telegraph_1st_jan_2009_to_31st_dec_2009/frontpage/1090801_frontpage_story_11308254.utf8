                                                                                                           Putin dons wet suit, tags a whale
                                Putin: Softer side                            
	Khabarovsk (Russia), July 31 (Reuters): Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin, a judo black belt who last year shot a tiger, today demonstrated his softer side by donning a wet suit and tagging a whale.        
	During a trip to eastern Russia, Putin waded into the Pacific Ocean and attached a satellite tracking tag to a Beluga whale named Dasha as scientists looked on, the government said.        
	She wont eat us will she? Putin asked. He then attached the device to the whale, which was held in place by a net, as part of research into the Belugas migration pattern, Itar-Tass news agency reported.        
	Putin patted the whale and said dont be angry, before helping scientists release her, state owned news agency RIA reported.         
	Last year, Putin was feted by Russian media for saving a television crew from an attack by a Siberian tiger in the wilds by shooting it with a tranquiliser gun. The former KGB spy cultivated a macho image during his eight years as President before stepping down last year. Putin, 56, made it into glossy magazines across the world two years ago by baring his muscular torso while on a fishing trip.

                                                                                                           Butus burden: No job, water, food... 
          DEVADEEP PUROHIT                            Butu Karmakar waits at the Purulia Sainik School ground for Rahul Gandhis arrival. (Amit Datta)                                  
	Purulia, April 24: She has never heard of Mamata Banerjee. She is not aware of the grand alliance between the Congress and the Trinamul Congress. She thinks Rahul Gandhi is the grandson of Rajiv Gandhi.        
	Butu Karmakar left her home at 6 this morning and waited for over four hours under a blazing sun, in 46-plus degrees, for a glimpse of her god.        
	People in my village say he (Rahul) is like a god, Butu smiled, explaining why she had turned up at the Sainik School ground in Purulia town, around 40km from her home. She walked more than half an hour to reach the bus stop in Rajnoagarh, a village in Puncha block.        
	Rahul was the main draw at the rally, held in support of the Congress candidate from Purulia, Shantiram Mahato.        
	Agey konodin emon meeting-e ashi nai (never attended such a meeting before), said Butu, mother of five daughters and a son, adding she had never missed casting her vote, though.        
	Todays rally was a first of sorts for Rahul, too  it was his maiden solo appearance on a political podium in Bengal. He got off a chopper around 11.50am and kept waving at the crowd.        
	Butu was not aware of the meetings historic significance  a phrase Congress leaders kept on repeating over the public address system. But whenever Rahul waved at the crowd of over 40,000 in one of Bengals poorest districts, she was on her feet and, at times, on a chair.        
	When Rahul cited how the UPA government had improved the life of the aam aadmi and the crowd burst into applause, Butu too clapped. When he blamed the state government for the abject poverty in Purulia, she joined the others in expressing appreciation.        
	I dont understand Hindi, but everyone is clapping, she said, trying to protect her face from the sun with the aanchal of her red sari.        
	Butu  whos married to Gaju, a wage labourer in Ranchi with a monthly income of around Rs 2,000  said she had never been to school and didnt know her age.         
	I cant count, how can I tell you my age or that of my children?        
	She, however, knew the most crucial bits about her existence: Jol nai, bhat nai, shak shabji nai, haspatal nai, daktar nai, kaaj nai, taka nai (no drinking water, no rice, no vegetables, no hospitals, no doctors, no jobs, no money).        
	Fish and meat are a luxury for the family of six (her eldest daughter Bhagya is married). We had chicken a few months ago when my husband was here, said the frail woman who left her home on an empty stomach this morning.         
	Although her village has a primary school, none of her six children  Bhagya, Malati, Jhalu, Tushu, Sangita and son Fulchand  go to school or ever did.        
	In his 10-minute speech, Rahul stressed the need for education for a brighter future. But Butus priorities are different. Getting my remaining four daughters married off is my biggest worry, but I dont know how to.        
	Her voice was drowned by a loud burst of cheering. Rahul had climbed off the podium and was walking towards the barricade to mingle with the crowd.        
	Butu tried her best to get close to him but lost out in the melee. Instead of blaming anyone, she wore a big smile as Rahul headed back to the chopper, which took off around 12.25.        
	While most in the audience took cover to escape the dust storm kicked up by the copter blades, she kept gazing at the machine. We are poor people and we really need help. I hope he will help us, Butu murmured.

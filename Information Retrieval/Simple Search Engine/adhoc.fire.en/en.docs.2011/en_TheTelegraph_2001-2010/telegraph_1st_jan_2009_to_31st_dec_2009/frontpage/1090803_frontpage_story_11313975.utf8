  - Govt orders magisterial probe as protesters call 48-hour bandh from today          OUR CORRESPONDENT                                          
	Imphal, Aug. 2: Pent-up anger burst into flames on Manipur streets as people clashed with police in Imphal East today demanding a judicial probe into the July 23 shootout in which a former militant and a pregnant woman were killed while five others were wounded.        
	The trigger for the latest flare-up was reproduction of photographs by Imphal-based newspapers today  the photos were first published in a Delhi-based portal  showing policemen leading Ch. Sanjit, the former militant, to a pharmacy and emerging with his body.        
	As mass anger over the fake encounter grew, chief minister Okram Ibobi Singh ordered a magisterial inquiry into the incident.         
	Rabina Devi, a pregnant woman and Sanjit were killed and five shoppers, including two women, were wounded in the shootout.         
	The police claimed the woman was killed and the five shoppers wounded in indiscriminate firing by Sanjit. They later shot dead Sanjit inside the medical store.        
	Residents of Sajor Leikai and neighbouring Chingangbam Leikai today laid siege to the 1-km stretch of the Tinsid Road, Sanjits locality, from Lamlong bazar to Kongpal bridge, not allowing anyone, including policemen, to take the road.         
	After a two-hour standoff, the police repeatedly warned a group of protesters squatting on the road, before using a water canon, exploding tear gas shells and stun bombs.        
	The protesters retaliated by throwing stones.         
	A journalist was injured in the hurling match. A man was beaten up by the police.         
	Imphal city also remained tense and a large number armed police personnel were deployed to prevent any flare-up.        
	As protesters raged through Khurai Tinsid Road burning tyres, Ibobi Singh went into a huddle with his ministers, senior police and civil officials to review the situation.        
	We have decided to order a magisterial inquiry. The probe will be conducted by Imphal West deputy commissioner S. Ibocha Singh to find the truth, a cabinet minister and close aide of the chief minister said after the meeting.        
	The police and government, however, have not reacted to the report and photos of the web portal. The director-general of police, Yumnam Joykumar Singh, said he was yet to see the report.        
	A joint action committee formed by residents of Khurai, however, rejected the magisterial order.        
	We will accept nothing less than a judicial inquiry. The news report and photos substantiated what we have been saying that Sanjit was killed in cold blood by the police. The personnel should be dismissed from service. We want the truth, demanded Th. Anita Devi, convenor of the action committee.        
	Joining the protest, Apunba Lup, a conglomerate of more than 30 citizen organisations, today announced its first phase of agitation with a 48-hour general strike throughout Manipur beginning midnight tonight.         
	Announcing the strike, K. Phunindro, co-ordinator of the Apunba Lup, said the strike was called in support of three demands: punishment of the police personnel involved in the killing, action against police officials who tried to cover up and resignation of Ibobi Singh for misinformation.         
	The Opposition, Manipur Peoples Party, also demanded a judicial inquiry into the market shootout and demanded Ibobi Singhs resignation.         
	Grenades found        
	Suspected militants lobbed two hand grenades at the private residence of agriculture and social welfare minister L. Loken Singh, located at Leimapkpam in Bishnupur district early this morning.         
	The police recovered the unexploded hand grenades from the courtyard of the house without the pins and safely exploded them in a secluded area in Leimapokpam.         
	The minister and his family were in the house, as they live at his quarters in the city.         
	No group has claimed responsibility for the incident.         
	In another incident, unknown people left a hand grenade at the residence of a businessman, Konsam Rajendro, at Chingmeirong in Imphal West this morning.

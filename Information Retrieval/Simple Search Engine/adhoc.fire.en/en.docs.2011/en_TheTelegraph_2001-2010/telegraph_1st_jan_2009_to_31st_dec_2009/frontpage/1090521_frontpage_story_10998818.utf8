The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | A sari carried with care
                                                                                                           A sari carried with care
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                          Mamata Banerjee arrives at 10 Janpath. (Rajesh Kumar)     
	Calcutta, May 20: Mamata Banerjee has gifted Sonia Gandhi a sari she bought at a campaign stop not far from Singur.        
	Wrapped in shiny paper, Mamata was seen hugging the parcel as she walked into 10 Janpath this morning.        
	The day the Lok Sabha results were out, Mamata decided to gift a sari to the Congress president. She was extremely happy with the results and told us the Congress alliance had worked in our favour. Thats why she wanted to give Soniaji something she likes, a Trinamul MP said. The sari she gave was from a collection she bought from Dhanekhali on an election tour this time.         
	The Dhanekhali, named after the place in Hooghly where it is woven, is a taant sari Mamata likes to wear herself.         
	Nandita Palchoudhuri, folk arts curator, said the lower cotton count makes the Dhanekhali thick. The saris are smart and simple with graphic patterns. A typical pattern would be a sithey sindoor  two thick black lines running along the border with a bold red line in between, like a streak of vermilion in the parting of the hair, she added.        
	A Trinamul functionary said Mamata was very protective about the sari she had gift-wrapped herself and asked about it at least twice before leaving Calcutta last night.         
	We were at a dinner from where Didi went straight to the airport. On her way, she asked whether the sari was in place. She was very protective about the gift, he said.        
	Sonia is said to be fond of handloom saris, particularly those with a signature weave.        
	The gift couldnt be more politically correct  Dhanekhali is 15km from Singur, which played no mean role in Mamatas victory. Besides, during her campaign, Mamata had lashed out at the Left government for neglecting the Dhanekhali handloom industry.         
	If voted to power, we will restore this industry to its pride of place in Hooghly, she promised an election meeting.         
	Ratna De Nag, the new Hooghly MP, said: Didi is fond of such saris because of the exquisite embroidery, stripes and checks and thats why she thought it a good gift for the Congress president. She loves to wear and gift such saris. During adda sessions, she would talk about the fine variety of Dhanekhalis she collects.

                                                                                                           Drought ends, C-4 overflows
  - Didis Delhi flat becomes a magnet for jubilant supporters           CHARU SUDAN KASTURI                            Mamata after taking oath. Picture by Rajesh Kumar                                        
	New Delhi, May 22: Three, two, one, ground. Cling!        
	Mamata Banerjee has arrived, the elevator bringing her down from her third-floor apartment to the parking lot and into the midst of supporters, some waiting for this moment for five years.        
	Mamata Banerjee zindabad. Didi, jai ho, a bunch of middle-aged supporters shouted, waving a large Trinamul Congress banner.        
	As shouts of support turned shriller into screeches, Mamata wove her way through the crowd to reach a Maruti Zen tasked with ferrying her to Rashtrapati Bhavan from the humbler C-4, her central Delhi MPs apartment that since 2004 has doubled as the Trinamul office in the capital.         
	Reduced to one MP  Mamata herself  for the past five years, Trinamul used todays cabinet swearing-in as an occasion for its first public celebration in Delhi over its Lok Sabha largesse.         
	Mamata has been a cabinet minister before in the NDA government between 1998 and 2004 but, according to 65-year-old party worker Rabi Sarkar from Murshidabad, this time its different.         
	Its a renaissance for us. Five years ago, we were swept out of the Lok Sabha and were forgotten nationally. With 18 other MPs behind her, lets see how people ignore Didi now, he said, a camera in hand to click photographs of his leader and her MP flock.         
	In the hours leading up to the swearing-in, Trinamul MPs came in small groups to visit Mamata at the apartment. This cramped office-cum-residence flat has never seen such a crowd before. I guess these are the pitfalls of working here if an MP suddenly becomes very important, grumbled a staff member at the complex, handed the task of running the elevator leading up to Mamatas apartment.         
	Actress Satabdi Roy, a first-time MP, came out of the apartment briefly in a lemon green sari but quickly walked back in.        
	Then, around 5.30pm, the flow of Trinamul leaders entering the apartment reversed, and the newly elected MPs started walking out, one by one. In their hands they held the Prime Ministers invitation to attend the swearing-in, which they had collected from Mamata.         
	In whispered tones, many among them asked each other questions on protocol. At 6.00, Satabdi walked out again, braved the crowd to descend in an elevator and walk towards the Zen. She would be accompanying Mamata, reporters were told.         
	Then Mamata emerged, ready for a fresh stint in Delhi as cabinet minister.         
	She spoke in Hindi, but Bengal was on her mind even as she was leaving for the Rashtrapati Bhavan. Hamari ladayi zameen ki ladayi hai, logon ki ladayi hai. Abhi khatam nahi, shuru hogi (Ours is a battle for land, for the people. It isnt over, it has just started), she said.        
	After the swearing-in, Mamata displayed the tact of a seasoned politician while fielding a question on the railway ministry  her likely portfolio. The Prime Minister has not declared it (the portfolio). I have a constitutional obligation and, therefore, cannot comment on it as yet, she told STAR Ananda in an interview.        
	Mamata said that her party could have got more ministries, but she did not believe in bargaining. Well probably get six more ministers, she said. We could have got more. But we dont want to make money.

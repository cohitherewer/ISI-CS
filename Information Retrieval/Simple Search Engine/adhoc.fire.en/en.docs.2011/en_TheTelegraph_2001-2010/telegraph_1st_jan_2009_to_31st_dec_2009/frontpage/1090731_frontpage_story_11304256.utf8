The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Mamata and Cong close to 1:1 deal
                                                                                                           Mamata and Cong close to 1:1 deal
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                            Mamata                                
	Calcutta, July 30: Mamata Banerjee and the Congress are understood to be moving towards a compromise formula that may lead to the Trinamul Congress contesting from Sealdah while leaving the Bowbazar Assembly seat to the ally, sources said.        
	Although no formal announcement has been made by either of the parties, it was learnt that a series of meetings between Mamata, finance minister Pranab Mukherjee, AICC general secretary Ahmed Patel and eventually Sonia Gandhi broke the ice.        
	Our leader had detailed discussions with the Congress leadership and the high command in Delhi over the past two days over seat-sharing. She met Soniaji yesterday night after talking to Pranab babu. No more dialogue is necessary as a solution has been reached. Trinamul will contest the Sealdah Assembly seat and allow the Congress to fight from the Bowbazar seat, a senior Trinamul Congress MP and close aide of Mamata said today.        
	Trinamul MP Somen Mitras wife Shikha will contest from Sealdah while Congresss Pradip Ghosh will fight it out from Bowbazar, the sources added. The Trinamul chief had initially insisted that both the seats be fought by her party nominees.        
	On the political chessboard, Mamata is said to have made a smart move, if not a masterstroke, by fielding Shikha as the Trinamul candidate from Sealdah, a section of the Congress leadership said.        
	Ghosh was the first to file his nomination from Sealdah as a Congress nominee. At this, Mamata put up Shikha as the Trinamul candidate there as she knew that being Somens wife would give the nominee an advantage in retaining the seat held by her husband for seven consecutive terms.        
	If Mamata had fielded any other candidate from Sealdah, Pradip would have cut into Trinamuls votes by a big margin as he is a local leader and had been ruling the roost there for decades. The Trinamul chief understood this. So, Mamata decided to field Shikha as she would not only get Trinamul votes but also the support of a big section of the Sealdah electorate that is loyal to Somen, said a Congress MLA.        
	If Mamata finally concedes the Bowbazar seat to the Congress, it would mean Pradips exit from Sealdah.        
	So, by fielding Somens wife, Mamata not only wanted to ensure Trinamuls victory from Sealdah. She also wants to drive out Pradip from Sealdah and that can happen only if she gives the Congress the Bowbazar seat from where he is likely to contest. So, the Trinamul leader made a smart move in the political game of chess, the MLA added.        
	Mamatas stakes are higher than the Congresss in the game of seat-sharing as she is being projected by Trinamul as the chief ministerial candidate in the 2011 Assembly polls. Hence, it wouldnt have been prudent for her to drive a hard bargain as her need to keep the alliance with the Congress intact is more than that of the latter.        
	The Trinamul chiefs move to meet Sonia to settle the deal with the Congress for just two seats also betrays her necessity to carry on with the alliance till the 2011 Assembly elections.        
	Mamata hadnt had a single meeting with Sonia for finalising the Lok Sabha election seat-sharing with the Congress. She had held meetings with Pranab babu and Keshava Rao for settling the number of parliamentary seats but not Sonia. The meeting yesterday with Sonia explains her desperation to hold on to the alliance as that can make her the next chief minister of Bengal, a Trinamul MP said.        
	For the Congress, the development will be an improvement in its bargaining power because of the partys impressive strength in the Lok Sabha.        
	If the Congress has succeeded in persuading Mamata to concede one Assembly seat, it will be a gain for us as we had to take whatever she had offered during the Lok Sabha seat bargain two months ago, a Congress leader said.

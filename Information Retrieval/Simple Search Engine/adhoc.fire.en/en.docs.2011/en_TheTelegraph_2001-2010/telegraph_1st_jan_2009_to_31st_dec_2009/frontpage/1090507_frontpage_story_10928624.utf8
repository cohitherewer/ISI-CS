          MUZAFFAR RAINA                            A protester, not Ahmad, gets set to hurl a stone at police during a demonstration in Srinagar on Wednesday. (Reuters)                                  
	Srinagar, May 6: Ahmad, 19, is eagerly waiting for election day in Srinagar. Not as a first-time voter, though  he hasnt even registered himself.        
	Ahmad is a volunteer for Srinagars ubiquitous stone-throwing brigade, which is always on the lookout for an opportunity to engage the security forces for the sacred azaadi cause. When elections are around, the protests step up a gear.        
	Srinagar remains the nerve centre of such clashes, and the government has put thousands of security personnel on the streets ahead of the May 7 vote. The separatists, on their part, have issued a 50-hour strike call from Tuesday evening in protest against the elections.        
	The situation is just ripe for the stone brigade to test the governments nerves.        
	We know there will be thousands of uniformed men on the streets but we will look to explore the gaps. These are a farce and we want to sabotage them, said Ahmad, who gave only a part of his name to avoid identification.        
	He and hundreds of his comrades have gone into hiding to evade arrest. The police are looking for me. I am staying at a relatives home with two of my friends.        
	Officials say that around 20 per cent of the eligible voters in Srinagar have not registered themselves, the main reason being their indifference to the elections.        
	Outside Srinagar, registered voters form 56 per cent of the population; in the city, the figure is just 44. Around 1.6 lakh voters are missing from the rolls in Srinagar and most of them are youngsters, a police officer said.        
	The government doesnt mind. The authorities feel its better not to enlist those opposed to the elections as voters  at least that gives a semblance of decency to turnout figures.        
	When there was massive participation in last years Assembly polls in the state, the turnout was just 21 per cent in Srinagar, the officer said.        
	If you enlist these youths as voters, the turnout would barely enter the two-digit mark since most of them would be unlikely to vote. This means a bigger humiliation for the government.        
	Only a fraction of the missing voters would be stone-throwers, but a common thread that binds them all is their indifference to elections.        
	Even registration does not mean an inclination to vote, since people have many other reasons to sign up as voters. For instance, they can get a voter photo-identity card, which would act as proof of identity and domicile during the regular challenges by the security forces.        
	A separatist leader, who refused to be identified, admitted that some of the stone-throwers were paid agents of certain separatist groups.        
	These groups want to keep the pot boiling, so some youths work as their agents. But 90 per cent of the protesters join them either out of love for the movement or because protesting has become a habit, he said.        
	The police have launched a manhunt in Srinagar to arrest troublemakers like Ahmad. We have identified hundreds of such youths. Scores have been picked up, a police officer said.        
	The superintendent of police (Srinagar North), Abdul Wahid, said: Security is being beefed up in view of the elections and troublemakers are being taken into preventive custody.        
	He declined to mention detention figures.        
	The Srinagar parliamentary constituency is made up of Srinagar city, Ganderbal and Budgam. Its mainly the city, though, that has witnessed large-scale boycott of every election in the past two decades.

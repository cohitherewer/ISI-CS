The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Bargain before the count   Give special status, gain votes in Delhi 
                                                                                                           Bargain before the count     -  Give special status, gain votes in Delhi 
          RADHIKA RAMASESHAN                                    
	New Delhi, May 15: The monotony of the customary counting-eve courtship was broken today by Nitish Kumar who openly set the price for offering support at the Centre.        
	The Bihar chief minister, whose party is projected to make significant gains in the Lok Sabha elections, declared that he would support any government at the Centre that accorded special category status to Bihar.        
	Nitishs statement, made at a book launch in Patna, was seen in the adulterous atmosphere of Delhi as an indication that he was open to looking beyond the NDA.        
	I request all (Bihar-based) parties to make it a pre-condition that the basis for their support will be conferring special category status on Bihar, the Janata Dal (United) leader said. We have a good opportunity to force a bargain in a hung House.        
	A special category state is entitled to central funds in the ratio of 90 per cent grant and 10 per cent loan. For others, it is 70 per cent grant and 30 per cent loan. A grant need not be repaid in most cases, and is interest-free while a loan has to be repaid with interest.        
	The countrys 12 special category states include many northeastern states. The NDA government granted the status to Himachal Pradesh and Uttarakhand, but turned down Bihar, then ruled by Lalu Prasads party. According the status now to Bihar could mean giving it a Rs 380,000-crore special package.        
	A Congress general secretary tried to douse speculation, saying his party had not spoken to the leaders of any parties except those in the UPA, and that no bargains would be struck before the numbers were known. Whats the point in discussing the demands (of prospective allies) unless we know how many seats they have won? he asked.        
	But Nitishs statement, which came a day before the declaration of results and five days after he had hugged Narendra Modi at an NDA rally, became the talking point among politicians fatigued by discussing poll projections and keeping track of whos meeting who.        
	A cabinet minister from a northern state let on that Nitish had several friends in the Congress and that they had got down to work.        
	Others suggested that the Congress had so far considered Nitish as its only prospective and tenable ally  the Biju Janata Dal, the ADMK and the Bahujan Samaj Party were not on its radar as of today.         
	The three will do everything to rub our nose on the ground before agreeing to do business with us. Nitish is political and has the big national picture before him. Its easier to handle him, a source said.        
	Dal (United) sources confirmed that Nitish had not abandoned a non-BJP option.         
	Theres a lot of pressure on him, from within our party and outside, to support a UPA dispensation. He is not worried so much about giving up the coalition government with the BJP in Bihar; his bigger worry is failing the mandate of the last Assembly polls. He also knows how Bihar BJP leaders tried to defeat his candidates in the Lok Sabha polls, a source said.        
	Congress sources, however, added that if the partys own tally crossed 170, they were confident about touching the majority mark of 272 with the current allies, the fourth front (Lalu Prasad-Paswan-Mulayam Singh Yadav) and Independents. Nitish, they said, would come into the frame only if Lalu Prasad and Paswan were down to a single digit.

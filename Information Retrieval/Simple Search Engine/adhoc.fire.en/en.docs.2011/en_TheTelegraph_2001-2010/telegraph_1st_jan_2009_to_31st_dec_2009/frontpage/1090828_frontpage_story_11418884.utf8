The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Justice on a roll in Dumka
                                                                                                           Justice on a roll in Dumka
  - 11500 cases in 21 days in mobile court        SUMAN K. SHRIVASTAVA                                                     
	Ranchi, Aug. 27: When justice was wheeled into Dumka, more than 11,000 petitions were filed with the mobile court in 21 days and most of them were to seek wages that remained unpaid because of faulty implementation of well-meaning government schemes, including the one under National Rural Employment Guarantee Act.        
	An initiative of Jharkhand State Legal Services Authority (Jhalsa), that was unveiled in Ranchi on July 5, the swanky air-conditioned bus, armed with a judicial team, is equipped with pinewood tables and swivel chairs for magistrates and advocates to use while hearing and deciding on cases.         
	Its first real stop for imparting justice was in Dumka between July 21 to 31, and Santhal tribals, always reluctant to making frequent trips to courts in towns and losing a days wages in the process, found it to be a useful tool.        
	As many as 11,500 petitions were filed with the mobile court in the 21 days the van toured villages and blocks in Dumka district  between July 21 and July 31 and between August 16 and August 25.        
	Interestingly, land disputes or criminal cases were few. Most cases related to recovering dues under the central schemes like NREGA, Indira Awas Yojana, maintenance and welfare of parents, Prevention of Witch Practices Act etc, pointed out P.K. Srivastava, the Dumka district judge-cum-chairman of the district legal services authority (DLSA).        
	Between July 21 and July 31, the court received 3,243 applications and that was because, as Srivastava pointed out, awareness was poor about judicial intervention in social schemes. But, grievances poured in when the court hit the road again on August 16, he said.        
	After its launch in Ranchi on July 5, the mobile court first went to Deoghar during the time of the Shravan Mela (from July 8 to July 20) to spread legal awareness among kanwarias.         
	On July 21, the mobile court shifted to neighbouring Dumka where it began hearing cases and then went on to tour the district till July 31. Then from August 1 to 14 it shifted to Deoghar where it heard cases.        
	Again from August 16, the mobile justice van was back in Dumka and till August 25, it had logged as many as 11, 500 applications.         
	The DLSA chairman pointed out that 10 per cent of all the cases (around 1,100) related to irregularities in implementing the rural job scheme.         
	The grievances related to job cards not being issued, or work not allotted to those with job cards or non-payment of wages, he said, commending the positive role of the district administration in ensuring the success of the venture.

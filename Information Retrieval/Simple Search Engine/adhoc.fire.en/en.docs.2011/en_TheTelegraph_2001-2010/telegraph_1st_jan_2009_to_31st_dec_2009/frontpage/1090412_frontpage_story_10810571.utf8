The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | BJP offers power to religion 
                                                                                                           BJP offers power to religion 
  - Advani writes letter to   leaders of all faiths        SANJAY K. JHA                                                          
	New Delhi, April 11: L.K. Advani has promised an institutionalised mechanism to allow religious leaders to get involved in the countrys governance if he becomes Prime Minister.        
	A letter he has sent to hundreds of religious leaders from every major faith promises that a BJP government would correct the prevailing notion that secularism means being anti-religion or religion-neutral.        
	Any consultative mechanism to legitimise religious bodies role in providing guidance to the government  as the letter promises  could be seen as detrimental to the Constitutions vision of India as a secular republic, although Advani promises equal respect for all religions.        
	The letter says: It will be my endeavour to seek on a regular basis the guidance of spiritual leaders of all denominations on major challenges and issues facing the nation. For this, we shall evolve a suitable consultative mechanism.        
	Although Advani has attempted an image makeover from hard-liner to moderate to try and fit into Atal Bihari Vajpayees shoes, his latest move signifies a major departure from the Vajpayee era.        
	During those years of BJP rule between 1998 and 2004, Hindu religious leaders, including Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP) mahants, had been extremely unhappy with the government.        
	Vajpayee had antagonised even the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh by keeping its leaders at bay, to the extent that new Sangh chief Mohan Bhagwat has said that nothing had changed with the change of government at the Centre (from the Congress and the United Front to the BJP).         
	Advanis letter follows a charter of demands from the Dharma Raksha Manch, a VHP-backed body that claims Indias identity cannot be religion-neutral and has demanded the country be declared a spiritual nation.         
	The Manch has representatives from all major religions but draws its sustenance from the larger Sangh parivar. Many of its demands  on conversions and the protection of the cow, the Ganga and the Ram Setu  find mention in Advanis letter.        
	The letter raises most of the parivars pet issues, including the regulation of foreign donations that are allegedly being used for conversions, but doesnt mention the construction of a Ram temple in Ayodhya. Although the Manch has called for a uniform civil code  an exclusively Hindutva agenda  Advani is silent on this.        
	According to PTI, sources in Advanis office said the letters recipients included Baba Ramdev, Shri Shri Ravi Shankar, Maulana Wahiuddin and several archbishops.        
	Our people have unshakeable faith in religion, and seek the guidance of religious leaders like you in matters both worldly and other-worldly. This is because religion in India has always cared for the well-being of the nation and its people, and striven for strengthening the ethical edifice of both the state and society, the letter says.        
	We shall end governmental neglect of the multi-faith spiritual heritage of India. The advocacy and practice of secularism, which unfortunately has come to acquire an anti-religious or religion-neutral connotation in the past five years, will be restored to its true meaning  Sarva Panth Samaadar (equal respect for all faiths).        
	The promises in the letter include beautification and development of important pilgrimage centres of all faiths, and amenities for pilgrims similar to those at the Vaishnodevi shrine and Tirupati.

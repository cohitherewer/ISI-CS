The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Hidden face at Sonia door spills game 
                                                                                                           Hidden face at Sonia door spills game 
          NISHIT DHOLABHAI AND RADHIKA RAMASESHAN                            Kumaraswamy                                  
	New Delhi, May 12: Third front partner H.D. Kumaraswamy was tonight driven into Sonia Gandhis residence, his face partly concealed by his hands but giving a sneak preview of suspected cloak-and-dagger games that have jumped the result gun by a few days.        
	Delhi weather is too hot. I was sweating, the Janata Dal (Secular) leader and son of former Prime Minister Deve Gowda later said, unable to resist a sheepish smile as he tried to explain how he was caught on camera covering his face when his car entered 10 Janpath tonight.        
	He did not say whether the air-conditioner in the Mercedes he was travelling in had packed up, making his hand the sole shield against the Delhi heat.         
	Wiser after the grand entry, Kumaraswamy left 10 Janpath through the rear gate. He later addressed reporters at his fathers Delhi house, apparently in response to frantic calls from other third front partners, and repeatedly swore allegiance to the Prakash Karat-led group.        
	The ostensible reason that compelled Kumaraswamy to brave the heat was issues relating to his home state Karnataka and the need to arrest the BJPs influence there. Kumaraswamy said neither did Madam (Sonia) ask for his support nor did he seek the same from the Congress.         
	There is no question of leaving the third front, the question does not arise. We are in the third front and will be in the third front. After all, my father launched the front in Karnataka, he said at his fathers Safdarjung Lane residence.        
	Being an adult and a former chief minister to boot, the son did not deem it necessary to keep either his father or his political family informed of his appointments in the capital. I am a former chief minister, it is not necessary for me to take permission to meet people, Kumaraswamy said.         
	Apparently, only after the meeting with Sonia did Kumaraswamy speak to CPM general secretary Karat and CPI leader D. Raja to explain why he met the Congress president.        
	Both father and son had played hard to get when the Congress tried to court them in the run-up to the polls. But in at least three seats in Karnataka, the Dal (Secular) is known to have had a tactical understanding with the Congress.        
	Kumaraswamy may or may not have been covering his face from the heat but four days before the election results, there is no denying that the political temperature is shooting up.        
	Sources said that the Congress, touched to the quick by the NDAs solidarity show in Ludhiana on Sunday, is striving to reassemble the remnants of the UPA and pick up new pieces. If Sonia went to Chennai on Sunday to reassure Karunanidhi, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh worked the phone today to keep Nitish Kumar in good humour.        
	The Congress sources said the party would try to weaken the third front. Bolstered by the Telengana Rashtra Samitis tilt towards the NDA from the third front, the Congress is hoping to pour oil into the fire by working on Kumaraswamy.        
	Although Kumaraswamy insisted he was still with the third front, his visit to Sonias house managed to generate feverish speculation that Karat was about to lose another ally.        
	The Congress sources said that if the front was emaciated, the Lefts bargaining clout would be greatly reduced, in case we need its support.        
	The Congress is also not averse to exploring the possibility of dumping the Samajwadi Party and embracing Mayavatis Bahujan Samaj Party, the sources said.        
	The party will continue to keep secular allies of the NDA on its radar, they added.

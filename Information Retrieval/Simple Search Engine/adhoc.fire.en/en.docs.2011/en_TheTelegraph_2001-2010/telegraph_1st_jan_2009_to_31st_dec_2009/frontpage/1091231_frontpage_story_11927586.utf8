          G.C. SHEKHAR                              
	Chennai, Dec. 30: Keeping a dog is not a fundamental right, especially if its barking annoys neighbours, says Madras High Court.        
	Maybe, but its a dogs fundamental right to be allowed to bark, retort animal activists.        
	No one is entitled to keep dogs or other animals in residential areas as a matter of right, a judge ruled last week, angering animal lovers by adding that dogs barking and howling and stench could be a public nuisance.        
	Justice S. Thamilvanan dismissed a petition by Coimbatore resident D. Vikram, three of whose neighbours had alleged that his nearly 30 dogs kept them awake at night and the animals foul smell was affecting their health.        
	The neighbours said Vikram was breeding the dogs to sell them. After an inspection of the house, the revenue divisional officer (RDO) ordered Vikram to remove the pets, especially since he did not have a licence to keep so many animals. Vikram then approached the high court.        
	Unbearable noise or foul smell can be an annoyance and hence a public nuisance, the judge said. Noise pollution and emitting foul smell by keeping dogs is no way a lesser hazard than a factory creating noise pollution.        
	The Animal Welfare Board of India said it might contest the ruling arguing that barking was a dogs basic right. Just as babies cry, dogs too bark, and it would be unjust to interfere with their nature. We would go through the court order and take suitable legal action to establish the rights of dogs. We are not concerned about the petitioners interests since we do not know his motive, said D. Rajasekhar, the boards secretary.        
	Chinny Krishna, chairman of animal charity Blue Cross, said animal lovers would be distressed by the ruling and might agitate if the authorities sought to use it as a benchmark.        
	Vikram had claimed he had only about half a dozen dogs which he kept as pets, and that taking them away would violate his fundamental rights. But the judge ruled the RDOs inquiries had proved he had a large number of dogs and was breeding them for commercial purposes without a licence.        
	M. Kumaravel, a neighbour, said: Vikram was breeding them and selling them at fancy prices. We showed the RDO video evidence of buyers visiting his home and walking away with pups.        
	For the past two years we could not lead normal lives because of the barks and howls. The fungal stench from so many dogs spread through the entire neighbourhood.

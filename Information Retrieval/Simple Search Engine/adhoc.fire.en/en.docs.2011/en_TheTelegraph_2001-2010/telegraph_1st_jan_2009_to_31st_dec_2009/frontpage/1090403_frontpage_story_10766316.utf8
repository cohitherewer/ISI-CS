The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Mooshahary calls for Delhi rule withdrawal
                                                                                                           Mooshahary calls for Delhi rule withdrawal
  - Governor says Cong ready to form govt           OUR CORRESPONDENT                                           
	Shillong, April 2: Meghalaya Governor R.S. Mooshahary this evening recommended withdrawal of Presidents rule, paving the way for a Congress-led government in the state.        
	In his letter addressed to President Pratibha Patil, the governor said Presidents rule could be revoked since the Congress was in a position to form a government in the state.         
	Confirming the development, a Raj Bhavan source said the Union cabinet was likely to meet in this regard after Prime Minister Manmohan Singh returns from the G20 meet in London. Earlier in the day, the Congress had paraded its legislators in front of the governor, claiming a majority of 31 and urging him to revoke Presidents rule so that the Meghalaya United Alliance (MUA) could form the government.        
	The delegation, led by Congress Legislature Party leader D.D. Lapang, included Independents Limison Sangma and Ismail Marak, Paul Lyngdoh of the Khun Hynniewtrep National Awakening Movement and Sanbor Shullai of the Nationalist Congress Party, the four legislators who had deserted the NCP-UDP-led Meghalaya Progressive Alliance (MPA).        
	The governor spoke over phone to Congress legislators Sniawbhalang Dhar, Comingone Ymbon and Lakhmen Rymbui, who were out of station, and met M.M. Danggo, who was not present during the meeting, this evening.         
	Lapang had told reporters after the meeting that the governor had assured them that he was willing to examine their demands. The Congress request for revoking Presidents rule came a day after United Democratic Party (UDP) legislator Ampareen Lyngdoh resigned from the Assembly and the party, reducing the Meghalaya Progressive Alliance (MPA) tally to 27, excluding the Speaker.                                      
	On whether Ampareen Lyngdoh would be invited to the Congress fold, Lapang said, She is welcome to join us. He denied that the Congress had any role in her resignation, but said the party would request her to support the government though she had resigned as a legislator.         
	He did not rule out the possibility of inducting Lyngdoh in the Congress-led ministry if the MUA formed the government. Anyone can be inducted in the ministry provided that he or she can get re-elected to the Assembly within six months, he added. According to sources, the Congress has plans to get her elected from Laitumkhrah on a party ticket.         
	On Speaker Bindo Lanongs decision to proceed with the final disqualification of the four legislators who deserted the MPA, Lapang said the action was illegal and unconstitutional and the former would face the consequences if he overstepped the limit. The Speaker is not above the law and he is also under the Constitution.         
	Lanong said Lapangs comments were highly illegal. He added that nobody could force his/her decision against the Constitution, indicating that Lapang could not be sworn in as the chief minister at this juncture. How can he challenge my decision as I had gone by the provisions of the Constitution? he asked.         
	More drama unfolded in the Assembly in the afternoon with Deputy Speaker and suspended NCP legislator Shullai trying to forcefully enter his official chamber which was locked according to the Speakers orders.         
	Some Congress legislators accompanied Shullai on the pretext of wanting to meet the Deputy Speaker to discuss some urgent matter.         
	Shullai told reporters that he would file a contempt case against the Speaker for barring his entry into his official chamber while he still held the post of Deputy Speaker.         
	I am also thinking of filing an FIR with the police and informing the concerned authorities, including the governor, against the Speaker, he added.         
	He, however, refused to answer a question on whether he was still with the NCP or with the Congress.         
	The Speaker said he had asked the Assembly secretary not to allow Shullai entry into his official chamber since he was a tainted Deputy Speaker against whom disqualification proceedings were pending. Lanong has also suspended Shullai as a legislator.         
	AICC general secretary in charge of the Northeast, Luizinho Feliero, said over phone that the office of the Deputy Speaker was independent and not allowing Shullai entry into his official chamber amounted to contempt of court.

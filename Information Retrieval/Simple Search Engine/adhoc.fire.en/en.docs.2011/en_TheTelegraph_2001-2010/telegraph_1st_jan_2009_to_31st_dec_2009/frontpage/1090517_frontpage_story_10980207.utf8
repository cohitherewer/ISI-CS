The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Manmohan wind in sails, Mamata tide engulfs Red fort 
                                                                                                           Manmohan wind in sails, Mamata tide engulfs Red fort

	A Left debacle in Bengal was not wholly unexpected, but few had predicted it would be on this scale. What was anticipated to be a seasonal storm has turned out to be a massive tsunami.         
	As in all post-mortems of major poll upsets, there will be hindsight discoveries of false techniques and hidden undercurrents. The CPM will try to find self-justifying rationalisations. Mamata Banerjee attributes her huge victory simply to her campaign slogan Ma, Mati, Manush, with its obvious reference to the land question that her Singur-Nandigram crusade made the centrepiece of this poll.         
	The anger against the Left, others would argue, perhaps has less to do with Buddhadeb Bhattacharjees policy on development than with the CPMs arrogance and insensitivity to dissenting opinion. That would make it more a negative vote against the Left than a positive one for Mamata and her stand on different issues, including land and industrialisation.        
	All these would be valid arguments. But the Bengal results this time suggest that the Lefts massive defeat was largely because of an even more significant political phenomenon.         
	This is the first time that the mood in Bengal was matched and reinforced by the national political mood. It was the combined force of Manmohan Singh and Mamata Banerjee that trounced the Marxists.         
	The wind from the rest of India met and merged with the wind rising in the Bay of Bengal, turning it into a fierce gale that swept the CPM off the ground all over the state except in the shrunken Red belt of Burdwan, Bankura, Purulia and West Midnapore districts. The collapse of other Red bastions such as Dum Dum, Barrackpore, Birbhum, Uluberia and Hooghly show how deep and wide the seismic tremor was.         
	It wasnt simply the coming together of the Congress and the Trinamul Congress. True, the alliance made for an arithmetic of hope for the alliance. One has to contrast the two parties alliance this time with that in 2001. Even if one added up the two parties votes in the 2006 Assembly polls, when they fought each other along with the Left, they would have been ahead of the latter in 116 Assembly seats.         
	The big difference between the alliance in 2001 and this time is that the Congress then was in decline and an NDA government was in power at the Centre. As the results all over India prove, it is an ascending Congress that made the Bengal alliance this time both numerically and politically a much superior force to what it had been eight years ago.         
	Manmohan, though not the kind of party leader that Sonia Gandhi or Rahul Gandhi is, became the public face of this resurgence of the Congress. As all surveys showed, his record as Prime Minister had a high rating among voters, both in urban and rural areas, and he was also far ahead of others as the choice for the next Prime Minister.         
	Thats how the rest of India saw the Congress and Manmohan. In a marked departure from the past, Bengal did what India did  trust Manmohan and the Congress and whoever went with them.        
	Contrast this with the 1984 Lok Sabha elections, when, despite the sympathy wave over Indira Gandhis assassination, the Left could hold its fort in Bengal even after losing 16 seats. Then too, Bengal did go Indias way, but only half-heartedly. Also, in 1984, the Lefts reign in Bengal was only seven years old; 32 years on, its a different story.        
	This trust in Manmohan and the hope of a more stable government under him may explain why even in Calcutta, where Mamatas agitation against the Tata car factory in Singur was supposed to swing some middle and upper-middle class votes away from her party, the Left did as badly as elsewhere in the state.         
	Of course, the trust in Manmohan would not have been enough to batter the CPM in Bengal. That task was done primarily by Mamata. The battle over land and its effect on the rural poor and the Muslims was essentially her handiwork. But a Mamata in battle mode benefited from the nationwide swing of public mood in favour of the Congress.         
	If the Muslims in Bengal had been upset by the fear of losing land to the governments industrialisation moves and by the Sachar Committee report, they were also part of a national trend, as suggested by the Uttar Pradesh results, of a general switch of the communitys loyalty to the Congress.         
	From here to the Assembly polls in 2011, when Mamata will launch her offensive for the final, as she is fond of putting it, this combined Congress-Trinamul resurgence, both in the government in New Delhi and on the ground in Bengal, will be a formidable force for the CPM to fight. But two years is a very long time in politics.

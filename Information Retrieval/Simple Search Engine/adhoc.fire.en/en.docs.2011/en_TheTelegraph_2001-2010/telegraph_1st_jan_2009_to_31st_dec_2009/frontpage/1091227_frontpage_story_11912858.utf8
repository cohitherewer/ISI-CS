          SANTOSH K. KIRO                                    
	Ranchi, Dec. 26: One of the two newly-elected JD(U) MLAs, Raja Peter may have been left with no alternative but to back the JMM-BJP combine, but his decision could make him unpopular among his voters in Tamar who celebrate him as the local hero who dethroned Shibu Soren.        
	The reference is to the January bypoll in Tamar that saw him defeat Guruji after he was fielded to do just that by former minister in the Madhu Koda cabinet, Anosh Ekka.         
	That defeat cost Soren the chief ministers chair, pushing the state to Presidents rule on January 18. Today, Gopal Krishna Patar, alias Raja Peter, is in the JD(U), having spent the last 24 hours wrestling with his conscience before reluctantly agreeing to support the JMM in forming a government.        
	His former boss Ekka is in jail facing corruption charges.         
	In his talks with Bihar party chief Lallan Singh and Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar, who had inducted him into the JD(U), Peter is understood to have aired his reservations in no uncertain terms.        
	I fought against Shibu Soren as a result of which he had to quit as chief minister. Tamar voted me to oust Soren from the chair. I fought on a JD(U) ticket, again on an anti-JMM plank, with a pledge to defeat Soren, he told them.        
	People voted for what I stood for. What will I tell my voters when they ask me why I was crowning the leader they voted me to defeat, he asked.        
	Ultimately, Soren had to talk to Nitish, who claimed throughout the day that the NDA was united. Not much is known about what transpired between the two leaders, but it was only after Guruji spoke to the JD(U) leader that Peter agreed.        
	Now, he was likely to be rewarded with a ministerial berth.         
	The party has decided to support Soren in forming the next government. I am just a loyal worker of the party, Peter told The Telegraph, trying to hide his dilemma.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Indian faces in Obamas message to Muslims
                                                                                                           Indian faces in Obamas message to Muslims
  - Video duo trace their roots to Kashmir and Bihar; White House makes room for Punjabi and Hindi           K.P. NAYAR                        Afeefa, Rashad: Vibrant voices				                                             
	Washington, June 5: President Barack Obama, who began his White House tenure in January by reaching out to Hindus and Muslims, followed up on that initiative by pointedly including Indian Muslims yesterday in his effort to make common cause with Islam in a historic speech at Cairo University.         
	Within hours of declaring that America is not and never will be at war with Islam, the full text of Obamas speech in Cairo was on the White House web site in Hindi, Punjabi and Urdu. In addition, two Indian Americans were on a White House video as poster children for inclusiveness of Muslims in US society soon after Obama spoke in Cairo.        
	To me, there is no contradiction between being an American, between being a Muslim, says Afeefa Syeed, a Kashmiri who works as senior adviser in the Obama administrations global aid agency, the US Agency for International Development, in the video.         
	Syeed, who emigrated to the US with her parents as a child and covers her head with a scarf, adds that to be an American Muslim simply to me means that you are practising your faith through the lens of an American identity.        
	The second Indian American Muslim on the video, Rashad Hussain, a deputy associate counsel to the President in the White House, was born in Wyoming and grew up in Texas, where his mother, Ruqaya, a graduate of Aligarh Muslim University, is a medical doctor.        
	Hussains parents are from Bihar. His father, Mohammad Hussain, is a retired mining engineer. He argues in the video that the Muslim community in America is very diverse, very vibrant and in many ways it looks like a cross-section of the greater American community.        
	In putting out the video, the White House Press Office rationalised that we thought we would share with you a few stories of Muslim Americans who are proudly serving their nation in the federal government.         
	Two of the three persons chosen for the video are of Indian origin. Obviously, with the power of YouTube and similar new media tools, the White House expects that the video will be watched by millions of people.        
	The message that goes out to Indian Muslims who watch these Indian Americans of their faith will be ones that New Delhi and Washington share about democracy and secularism.        
	In his typical no drama style, without hype or cliche, Obama cited the Indian experience with non-violence in the most talked about segment of his speech  the one dealing with the right of Palestinians to a state of their own.        
	For centuries, black people in America suffered the lash of the whip as slaves and the humiliation of segregation. But it was not violence that won full and equal rights, Obama said in a low-key but meaningful reference to Martin Luther Kings adoption of Gandhian methods of non-violence in the pursuit of civil rights for blacks in the US.        
	He went on to the story of Indias peaceful struggle for independence and Nelson Mandelas embrace of Gandhi in the fight to end apartheid. This same story can be told by people from South Africa to South Asia, Obama said.        
	But it is a testimony to the great detail that went into constructing his Cairo speech that while Obama mentioned South Africa, he avoided any reference to India by name. South Africa is not controversial in the Islamic world. On the contrary, it is popular. India is not.        
	By invoking Indias freedom struggle without naming India, Obama was sensitive to Indias exclusion from the Organisation of the Islamic Conference, which actually criticises New Delhi at most of its meetings.        
	The decision to translate Obamas speech and make it widely available to Indian Muslims in Hindi, Punjabi and Urdu was an after-thought.        
	In a final update to the media about 14 hours before the President spoke in Cairo, the White House press had office formally put out an advisory that the translations of the speech would only be available in Arabic, Urdu, English and Persian.        
	White House sources said the eleventh-hour decision to include Punjabi and Hindi translations was taken at the highest levels with India in mind because of its second-largest Muslim population in the world.        
	But the sources would not say whether the President was directly involved in making the decision.         
	As soon as the state department made the translations available, the US embassy in New Delhi and the consulates in Chennai, Hyderabad and Mumbai made those links easily available to Indians.        
	Curiously, the links to three languages spoken by Muslims in India were missing from the website of the US consulate in Calcutta at the time of writing, 30 hours after they were available at all other relevant US government websites.

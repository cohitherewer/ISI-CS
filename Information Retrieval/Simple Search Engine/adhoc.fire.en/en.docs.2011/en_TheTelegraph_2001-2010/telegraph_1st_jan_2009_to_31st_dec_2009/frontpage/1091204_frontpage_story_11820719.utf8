  - Cautious Centre works on deal with Rajkhowa          OUR BUREAU      
	Dec. 3: The Centre is trying to work out a deal with Ulfa chairman Arabinda Rajkhowa that will protect his honour as well as project him as a negotiator in a peace deal with the Delhi durbar.        
	This was being done so that the peace deal, which the government hopes to crystallise within the next few days, will find acceptability within a large section of his banned outfit.        
	Although Union home minister P. Chidambaram was mum on the issue today and refused to respond to questions, sources said Rajkhowa had been brought to Delhi from Bangladesh via Tripura last night and that efforts were on to find a politically acceptable peace deal.        
	It is a very politically sensitive matter and it must appear to be an honourable deal for Rajkhowa so that his outfit accepts it, a source said. It must not appear to be a surrender by the Ulfa leader.        
	According to sources, as part of the deal, once an agreement is reached between the two, Rajkhowa could be taken back to the Tripura border or even to Bangladesh and officially given safe passage so that he can attend the proposed talks in Delhi.        
	Sources said the ITBP, RAW and other agencies interrogated him through the day while the backroom boys in the Union home ministry were engaged in an in-camera exercise: to look for ways through which Rajkhowa finds himself on a level playing field when he begins treading the path of peace.        
	According to the sources, the government is planning to draw up a declaration for Rajkhowa to ink which will spell out his decision to hold peace talks.        
	Rajkhowa has a mind of his own and contents of the declaration are being discussed with him threadbare. He is certainly not a rubber stamp, a counter-terrorism expert linked to the Centre said. The document should not lack credibility.        
	The Centre wants to ensure that the declaration will not put on the negotiating table the demand for Assams sovereignty. The government will reciprocate by favourably considering a charter of demands laid out by the outfit for socio-political-economic enhancement of Assam, the source said. This will also be consistent with the governments position that sovereignty cannot be on the agenda.        
	During the talks, both sides are likely to take up the sensitive issue of unabated influx from Bangladesh. With a friendly government in place in that country, steps may be taken to see that Bangladesh makes an effort to prevent its citizens from crossing over to India, the source said.        
	The pro-talk group of Ulfa, comprising cadres of the A and C companies of the 28 battalion who bid farewell to arms last year, has also laid stress on the need to stem the influx in its proposals submitted to the Centre.        
	The sources indicated that during todays discussions, Rajkhowa asked for the release of some senior Ulfa leaders now in jail to join him at the table to find a solution to the 30-year-long insurgency.        
	In the course of discussing the draft declaration, what is turning out to be a ticklish issue, the source said, is whether Rajkhowa will agree to the Centres intention of making the talks tripartite by including the Assam government since the outfit had all along maintained that a dialogue could be held only with the central government.         
	However, a big question continues to haunt the government: will the exercise bear fruit if it is not blessed by Ulfa commander-in-chief Paresh Barua?        
	Voices replying in the negative have already been heard in Assam as they made it clear that without Barua in the picture there could be no permanent peace.        
	Sources say that ever since security operations in Bhutan in 2003, Barua has systematically dismantled the political apparatus of the organisation and all members now belong to the military wing of the outfit and carry military designations.        
	True, Rajkhowa too commands respect but Barua is the charismatic one whose name alone has inspired a large number of youths from the state to join Ulfa, an army officer said.

	Tehran, Aug. 16 (Agencies): Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad today said he would propose at least three women ministers in his new cabinet following Junes disputed election.        
	It would be the first time a woman would hold such a ministerial position in Iran since its 1979 Islamic revolution. One woman minister under the Shahs government, Farrokhroo Parsa, was executed after the revolution in 1980.        
	The announcement appears to be an attempt by Ahmadinejad to enlist the support of Iranian women as he fends off criticism from the Opposition that his re-election was fraudulent.         
	The appointments seem unlikely to appease reformists, however, since both the women he named are fellow hard-liners.        
	Ahmadinejad has until August 19 to present a cabinet to the parliament for approval but may get a rough ride from the conservatives who dominate the Assembly, as well as from his moderate foes.        
	With the 10th presidential election, we have entered a new era... conditions changed completely and the government (make-up) will see major changes, Ahmadinejad told state television.        
	He named two of his proposed female ministers and said at least one more would be added to the list.        
	The ones he named were Fatemeh Ajorlou, now an MP, as social welfare minister and Marzieh Vahid Dastjerdi as health minister.        
	At least one more will be added, Ahmadinejad said.        
	Ahmadinejad currently has a female Vice-President on his cabinet who is in charge of the environment.

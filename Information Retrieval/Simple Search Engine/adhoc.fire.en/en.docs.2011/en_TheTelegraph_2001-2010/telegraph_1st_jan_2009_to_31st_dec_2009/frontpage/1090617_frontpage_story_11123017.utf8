	June 16: The Bengal government today called central forces to Lalgarh but did not declare if they would be sent into action against Maoists who enforced their writ through the day like a militia in a conquered territory.        
	The Maoists ransacked and burnt a CPM zonal committee office in Lalgarh, imposed conditions for the return of villagers to Dharampur and oversaw the surrender of arms by CPM cadres involved in the gun battle that had raged over the weekend.        
	Police made the Maoists task easier, continuing to stay away from even the outskirts of the liberated zone in West Midnapore.        
	The rebels also warned that after Dharampur, the occupied belt 11km from Lalgarh, it would be the turn of adjoining Salboni to get a feel of the wrath of the people if the CPM tried to put up any resistance.        
	By evening, the state government sought to address charges of inaction by announcing that it had sought five companies (around 600 personnel) of the CRPF from the Centre. In Delhi, the CPM politburo also called upon the Centre to rush the required number of paramilitary forces as requested by the state government.         
	One company of central armed forces has reached the state and is already on its way to the Lalgarh area which saw renewed violence in the last couple of days, chief secretary Asok Mohan Chakrabarti said at Writers Buildings. We had asked for five companies of armed forces from the Centre but have received one so far. More forces will be sent in shortly. We have to understand that it is not always possible for Delhi to sanction whatever states ask for immediately.                    
	Official sources did not give any indication whether the political leadership had given the go-ahead for tough action. The CPM state secretariat meeting discussed the issue for three hours this evening but did not announce any step specific to Lalgarh.         
	However, a CPM statement urged citizens to come out for pratibad-pratirodh (protest and resistance)  considered a euphemism for strikeback. But party sources said the call to retaliate was addressed more at cadres in strongholds like Burdwan which has witnessed murders blamed on the Trinamul Congress.        
	The sources said the final decision on using force in Lalgarh was unlikely to be taken before the chief minister meets the Prime Minister in Delhi on Friday.         
	Had the state government wanted to launch an operation earlier, some central forces were available in the state. The chief secretary said that around seven companies of central forces were already working in the state. Asked if the administration is taking a soft stance, Chakrabarti said: We are doing what we think is best to return normality in the area as soon as possible.         
	On the outskirts of Lalgarh, the Maoists used the day to further tighten their grip. About 5,000 residents of Dharampur, for 30 years a CPM bastion, returned to their homes today from neighbouring areas where they had taken shelter.        
	Party supporter Biswajit Mahato said the Maoists had sent word to us that if we joined the Peoples Committee Against Police Atrocities and backed their movement, we could return home and live peacefully. Since all our CPM leaders had fled and accepted defeat, we decided to accept the terms set by the Maoists.        
	After the villagers returned to Dharampur, a dozen CPM cadres surrendered their arms to representatives of the Peoples Committee Against Police Atrocities.        
	 Later in the evening, committee leader Chhatradhar Mahato warned at a rally in Lalgarh bazaar attended by 20,000 people that Salboni could be the next target.        
	We have information that the CPM in Salboni is bringing in arms and men from Panskura (a CPM stronghold in East Midnapore). Im warning them they will face the same fate as the people of Dharampur if they dont stop their designs to hit at us, Mahato said.        
	CPI (Maoist) spokesperson Gour Chakraborty later said: We have been with the committee and wherever armed resistance is required, well be there with them.         
	After the meeting, as the crowd dispersed, about 2,000 people converged on the Lalgarh CPM office and ransacked it.

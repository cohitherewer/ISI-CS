The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Young cops to man rebel-hit districts 
                                                                                                           Young cops to man rebel-hit districts 
          AMIT GUPTA                              
	Ranchi, Oct. 2: Jharkhand announced a major reshuffle of IPS officers today with the administration posting new, younger police chiefs in 12 districts, some of which had gained notoriety for becoming a breeding ground of Left-wing extremism.         
	While announcing the transfers of 21 police officers, the state administration  now headed by Governor K. Sankaranarayanan under Presidents rule  has apparently kept in mind the Centres plan to launch a massive anti-Naxalite operation across the Maoist-infested states of Orissa, Bihar, Jharkhand and Chhattisgarh, the last two recently dubbed as epicentres of Left-wing extremism by home minister P. Chidambaram.        
	Former superintendent of police (SP) of Garhwa Saket Kumar Singh has been transferred to Bokaro district, considered vulnerable to Maoist terror.         
	Palamau, another Maoist stronghold and one of the designated pilots for Centres development schemes, also gets a full-time SP with the posting of young IPS officer Jatin Narwal.         
	Palamau has been without a regular SP  Saket Kumar Singh was holding additional charge  ever since Mohit Bundas went on long leave.         
	Giridih SP Aseem Vikrant Minj will replace Narwal as the new police chief of Khunti district, which is currently in the midst of a massive search operation after Wednesdays abduction of special branch inspector (an intelligence officer) Francis Indwar allegedly by CPI (Maoist) rebels.         
	Another young IPS officer, Ravikant Dhan, who was waiting for a posting has been given charge of Giridih.         
	Posting younger IPS, who have proved their mettle in policing, indicates that the reshuffle has been made keeping in mind the offensive being planned against Naxalites, said an inspector-general (IG) rank police officer. Moreover, some performing SPs have not been touched.         
	Bokaro SP Laxman Prasad Singh, an old hand, has been made commandant of Jharkhand Armed Police (JAP) Battalion II at Tatisilway, Ranchi.        
	A senior police officer reasoned that it was imperative for the administration to fill vacancies and ensure key districts were manned as the Election Commission was expected to announce the schedule of Assembly elections by the end of October.        
	Todays reshuffle, which comes almost eight month after former Governor Syed Sibtey Razi announced changes in the police postings, was a result of a series of meetings held within the state administration after the September 25 visit of Chidambaram.        
	Chief secretary Shiv Basant was joined by senior state police officials to formulate the changes. Also, Vijay Raman, special DG of the Central Reserve Police Force, had also flown down to the state to discuss operational details of a possible strike against Maoist dens.

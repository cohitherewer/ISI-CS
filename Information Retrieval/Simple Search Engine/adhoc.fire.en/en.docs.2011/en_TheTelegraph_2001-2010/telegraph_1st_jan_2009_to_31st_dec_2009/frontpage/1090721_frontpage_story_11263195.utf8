          OUR BUREAU                        Hillary Clinton with SM Krishna after signing an agreement in New Delhi on Monday. (PTI)				                                       
	New Delhi, July 20: Hillary Clinton today promised to pitch expanding Indo-US ties on even higher ground than previous administrations and clarified sharply that Washington was not opposed to transfer of nuclear enrichment and reprocessing technologies to India.        
	But the secretary of state could not carry home a signed agreement that would have allowed the US to meet a domestic requirement and let American companies bid for multi-billion dollar defence deals in India.        
	Choosing their words carefully, both sides suggested they had reached, not signed, an agreement on the end-use verification pact that will allow the US to verify how India is using the military equipment it buys from America.        
	The Telegraph had reported on Sunday that a cautious course was likely as India was reluctant to be seen in public as making a categorical commitment.        
	The end-use verification agreement is required by US law for weapon sales and is crucial for American companies such as Lockheed Martin and Boeing to bid for multi-billion dollar Indian armament deals.        
	Statements in Delhi and Washington this evening implied that some differences on the agreement were still to be ironed out. It is an arrangement, not an agreement, an Indian official said  a distinction which found echo in a fact sheet issued by the state department in Washington.        
	External affairs minister (S.M.) Krishna announced the Indian governments agreement to end-use monitoring arrangements for high-technology military sales between India and the US, the state department said.        
	However, Clinton took care to address the overriding concern in India about the course of bilateral ties after Barack Obama became the US President.        
	I can pledge more than what Presidents (Bill) Clinton and (George) Bush did. I am deeply committed to building this relationship because I believe co-operation between the US and India will drive progress in the 21st century Clinton said.        
	Her assertion came at a media conference with Krishna this evening at the conclusion of her five-day visit to India.        
	Asked to comment whether the Obama administration had shifted focus away from India in seeking stronger ties with China and Pakistan, Clinton said: Well, the US is constantly called upon to play a role in the world, every hour of the day, and we do have relations with other countries, but I cant underestimate the nature of our relations, especially because it is a relationship between the oldest and the largest democracies in the world. Now that is a stronger basis for ties than any other.        
	She also flagged Obamas invitation to Prime Minister Manmohan Singh  its for an official visit beginning November 24  as an indicator of the special Indo-US relationship. The very fact that President Obama has invited Prime Minister Manmohan Singh to make the first state visit of the new administration is an indication of how importantly we view India, Clinton said.        
	Elaborating on her talks with government leaders, Clinton said: What we have outlined today will mean a significant expansion in our relations. External affairs minister Krishna and I will chair a continuing strategic dialogue and we want it to be not just a dialogue between governments, we want it to become a dialogue between our two nations and peoples.        
	The dialogue process must become a forum for action, what Americans and Indians have in common is that we like to roll up our sleeves and get things done.        
	On transfer of nuclear enrichment and reprocessing technologies that had come under a cloud after a G8 statement, she said: We dont oppose such transfers to India, there is now a basis for it which is, of course, the civilian nuclear deal.        
	She was quick to attach general US concerns on the issue, saying: But we are opposed to unauthorised and inappropriate transfers which can take place. There is a right way to do it and a very wrong way. We are seeking advice from India on how to prevent such unauthorised and dangerous transfers.         
	Clinton said Delhi had approved two nuclear sites reserved for US companies, part of the civilian nuclear agreement, but did not name them, though locations such as Andhra Pradesh and Gujarat were being speculated about.         
	 I am also pleased that Prime Minister Singh told me that sites for two nuclear parks for US companies have been approved by the government, she said. The subsequent state department fact sheet was a tad less categorical, saying India pledged to designate two sites.        
	Clinton arrived at Hyderabad House overlooking India Gate a little behind schedule for delegation-level talks with Krishna and Indian officials; she came straight from a meeting with Congress president Sonia Gandhi at 10 Janpath, which carried on much longer than scheduled. Congress general secretary Rahul Gandhi also met her.        
	Earlier in the day, Singh hosted Clinton to lunch at his residence. Rahul was the only Congress functionary who figured on the Prime Ministers list of invitees.               
	WHAT BOTH SIDES TAKE AWAY FROM THE TABLE                Arrangement, not signed agreement, on end-use verification of US defence equipment bought by India   Hillary clears uncertainty surrounding bilateral ties during the Obama era. Prime Minister Manmohan Singh to visit the US on November 24  the first state visit by a head of state to America after Obama took over   Hillary clarifies deal will be for full civilian nuclear co-operation, including technology transfer and fuel reprocessing rights. Says G8 restrictions will not apply to India   Both sides to step up co-ordination on counter-terrorism.

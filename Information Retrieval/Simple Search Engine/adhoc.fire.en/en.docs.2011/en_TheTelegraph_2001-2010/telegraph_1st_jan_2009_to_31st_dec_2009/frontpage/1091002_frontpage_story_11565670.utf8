The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Condom? Sorry, make do with a candle
                                                                                                           Condom? Sorry, make do with a candle
  - Independent candidate and AIDS activist denied safe-sex symbol by poll panel           GAJINDER SINGH                                                    
	Chandigarh, Oct. 1: Election symbols can fly like the Save Goa Fronts aeroplane or roar like the Forward Blocs lion. They can allow a candidate to blow his own conch (Biju Janata Dal) or beat his own drum (United Democratic Party, Meghalaya).        
	But a condom? Thats a no-no.        
	When Anand Prakash Sharma, Independent candidate from Karnal in Haryana, asked to be allotted the safe-sex sheath as his symbol, he was told it couldnt be done. Instead, he has been offered the candle, perhaps because the Election Commission thought a candlelit dinner was as far as it could allow romance to be taken on its beat.        
	Sharma today wrote to chief election commissioner Navin Chawla expressing shock at the absence of condoms from the official list of symbols that has room for such articles of everyday use as the bat, almirah, battery, torch, comb, ladies purse, pressure cooker  even the fork and the walking stick.        
	Its strange that while the Centre and state governments can spend crores on advertisements asking people to practise safe sex by using condoms, it cannot allow its use as a symbol to contest elections in the country, Sharma, 45, told The Telegraph.        
	His letter to Chawla, written in Hindi, appeals for the inclusion of Nirodh in the list of symbols.        
	The faster you include (the) condom, the better it will be for society and the nation, it says. When families can together watch TV advertisements and read about condoms in newspapers and magazines, I have no reason to believe that they will not accept its use as a poll symbol. It will help create awareness on HIV/AIDS and can also help stem the growing population.        
	The issue is close to Sharmas heart. He says he has for the past 15 years been working on promoting HIV/AIDS awareness and the rights of sex workers. These were to be his planks for the October 13 polls.        
	The poll panel has a list of 70 free symbols, apart from reserved ones like the hand (Congress) and the lotus (BJP), to be allotted to other parties and Independents.        
	Its not that the commission objects to the idea of protection  it had awarded the umbrella to the Sikkim Democratic Front. Nor is it against items that one can wear  its list includes the frock, coat and the hat.        
	I had initially thought I would be able to convince the poll officials. Since no political party uses the condom as its symbol, it could have been provided to me, a dejected Sharma said. But the commission decided to go by the book (symbol of the National Peoples Party, Manipur).        
	Sharma said he had sent a copy of his letter to the states election officials. The officials claimed ignorance about Sharmas request but one of them said with a smile: Perhaps it (the condom) can be included (in the list) in the next round.        
	Sharma has a court precedent on his side. The Supreme Court recently suggested to the commission, in a non-binding observation, that it grant any symbol demanded by a political party or an Independent.         
	The court granted the engine, whistle and the coconut  none of them figure on the list of 70  to three unrecognised Maharashtra parties.

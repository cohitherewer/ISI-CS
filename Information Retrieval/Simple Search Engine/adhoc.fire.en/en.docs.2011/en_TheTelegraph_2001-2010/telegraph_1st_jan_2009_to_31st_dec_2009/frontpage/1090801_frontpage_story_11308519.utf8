  - Loose leash on drug quality          G.S. MUDUR                                     
	New Delhi, July 31: Poor regulatory monitoring of drug manufacturing practices, opaque state regulators and public apathy may be factors fuelling the fairly steady levels of substandard medicines in India, medical experts have said.         
	India has the worlds fourth-largest drug industry which, government officials estimate, manufactures medicines worth about Rs 850 billion  including exports of Rs 350 billion.         
	But figures from state drug regulators and a recent study of drug samples, as reported in The Telegraph today, suggest that the level of substandard medicines in India appears to vary from 5 per cent to 12 per cent.         
	But Indias apex agency that regulates drugs  the Central Drugs Standard Control Organisation (CDSCO)  says it is handicapped because scrutiny of manufacturing practices and follow-up action on substandard drugs are tasks entrusted to state regulators.         
	We have nearly 30 state drug controllers and there may be variations in the way they interpret manufacturing standards, said a senior official of the organisation.         
	The watchdog doesnt even have a list of all manufacturers licensed to produce drugs in India.         
	The manufacturing licences are given by the states  and they do not inform us which company makes what drugs, the official said.         
	Pharmacology experts believe the current regulatory environment in India is conducive to laxity in drug manufacturing practices which has the potential to contribute to substandard drugs. When you have an unsupervised environment, some companies are likely to drift towards low (manufacturing) standards, a senior official in the World Health Organisation said, requesting anonymity.         
	But questions over manufacturing standards practiced at even some leading Indian companies have tumbled out through US inspections of facilities that manufactured drugs intended for export to the US.         
	Over the past year, the US Food and Drugs Administration (FDA) has sent warning letters to at least two companies  Ranbaxy and Lupin  saying that inspections at their facilities in India had revealed significant deviations from the US current good manufacturing practice regulations. Both letters, made public by the FDA on its website, list out point-by-point observations by the US inspectors.         
	A Lupin spokesperson said the issues were procedural and had nothing to do with the quality of products. A Ranbaxy official said the company had submitted a corrective action plan to the FDA and was expecting a response shortly.         
	Indian drug regulators appear unfazed by the FDA action. A senior official said India had its own standards for good manufacturing practices, which were different from the standards the US followed.         
	Pharmacology experts believe the medical community as well as drug regulators should share the blame for inadequate investigation, and follow-up action on, suspected samples of substandard drugs.         
	When a medicine doesnt work, doctors just prescribe another one, said Anupama Sukhlecha, assistant professor of pharmacology at a government medical college in Jamnagar. There is little thought why it it didnt work, she said.         
	Even educated patients dont ask questions about why a drug didnt work, said Vijay Thawani, associate professor of pharmacology at the Government Medical College in Nagpur. Theres no public pressure on this at all, he said.         
	Senior CDSCO officials said the central drug agency does not have a comprehensive list of investigative action initiated against drug companies by state regulators after detection of substandard drugs.         
	Weve been trying to get a list of companies from the states, one official said.         
	Experts tracking the substandards drug problem in India say the figures of 5 per cent to 12 per cent or even 8 per cent  from state regulators  are not much use because there are likely to be wide variations  across shops and across regions.         
	We only have a macro-picture, not a micro-picture of substandard drugs, said Chandra Gulhati, editor of the Monthly Index of Medical Specialities, India, a journal of drugs. We need studies on which sets of drugs are more vulnerable to become substandard, Gulhati said.

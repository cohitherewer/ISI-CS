          RAJKUMAR AND AMIT GUPTA                                              
	Barwadih (Latehar), April 15: Maoist triggered landmines to blow up a bus carrying ration meant for central paramilitary forces on poll duty in Latehar district today, leading to a fierce encounter killing two CRPF men and at least six others.        
	The blast occurred at 6.15am, 24 hours before tomorrows voting, as the private bus carrying luggage and ration of a CRPF company was going up a hilly terrain on the Barwadih-Mandal road passing through Baraniya forests in Latehar, around 200 km from the state capital.        
	The blast ripped apart the bus and killed its driver, Vijay Sahu (45), and the lone CRPF jawan who was on board, Dharmendra Yadav of Alwar (Rajasthan) and belonging to the 14 battalion.        
	Aware that the area could be booby-trapped, the other jawans, around 100 of them, were on foot. They were on way to Lat, 20km from their camp at Barwadih Middle School. From Lat, they were to disperse to various booths in Chatra.         
	Soon after the blast, which occurred after the jawans had barely covered 6km, the CRPF engaged the Naxalites in an encounter. The rebels were at an advantage as they were on higher ground. But we were fortunate to find some walls which we used to guard ourselves and fire on the Naxalites, said a jawan. Otherwise we would have suffered more casualties. They were almost equal in number.        
	Eight CRPF men were injured and all were airlifted to Ranchis Apollo Hospital. Among them, Mahipal Singh, a sub-inspector, died on way. The others undergoing treatment were Hashim Thatha, Gharchand, Jitendra Basumatri, Bhagwan Singh, Hari Chandra, Hamraj Gujjer and Sudhir Kumar, who is in a serious condition.         
	CRPF jawans claimed at least five Naxalites had been killed in the encounter, but DIG (Palamau) Nandu Prasad wouldnt confirm this.         
	Villagers of neighbouring Murbenya said those who died were identified as Sanjay Bodra (20), Supay Bodra (45), Budhan Bodra (40), Massey Bodra (16) and Pitai Mundu (35). But they werent Naxalites, they claimed. CRPF personnel dragged them out of a nearby trench where they were hiding while the encounter was going on and killed them in a fit of rage, alleged Supas Bodra, father of Massey.        
	Prasad said he was looking into the allegations. Five persons were killed in the cross-fire. I have asked the superintendent of police to find out whether they were villagers or Naxalites, he said.        
	Later, a bomb squad defused two landmines that were planted on the route.         
	Barwadih SDPO Ashwini Kumar Sinha said they recovered used cartridges of 7.62 and 7G bore indicating that the rebels were using foreign weapons.

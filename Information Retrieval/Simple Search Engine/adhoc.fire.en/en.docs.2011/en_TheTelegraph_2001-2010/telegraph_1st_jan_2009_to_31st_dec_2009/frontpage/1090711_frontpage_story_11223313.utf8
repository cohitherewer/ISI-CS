          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Calcutta, July 10: Industry will not be allowed to set up units on fertile tracts in Bengal but will be asked to choose sites in five districts where barren stretches are available, said a minister tasked after the Left Fronts poll setback to draw up a land-use map.        
	Industrialists will no longer be allowed to ask for land of their choice in places like Singur. From now on, we will tell them land is available in the western districts. Either you accept it or go (pachhando hole nao, noile kete poro), land and land reforms minister Abdur Rezzak Mollah told the Assembly today while replying to the debate on his departmental budget.        
	The minister listed the five districts as Bankura, Purulia, West Midnapore as well as parts of Burdwan and Birbhum. Non-agricultural land  scarce in Bengal because of the fertility of the Gangetic plain  is available in these areas but investors have largely been skirting the region for lack of infrastructure and connectivity with Calcutta.        
	The assertion of Mollah, a known critic of the use of farmland for industry, is largely symbolic for the time being as few big-ticket investments are expected before the Assembly elections in 2011. The Left Front government, reduced almost to lameduck status after the successive controversies in Nandigram and Singur and the debilitating blows in the elections, is not expected to court industry aggressively during the intervening months.        
	However, Mollahs statement today served to bring back under the glare the divisions within the government on the issue. Chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee and industries minister Nirupam Sen, two faces with whom the reindustrialisation drive was identified, were not present in the House.        
	If the government decides to enforce the Mollah model, it will mean that investors like Ratan Tata will have to confine themselves to western Bengal.         
	Tata Motors was shown four places  Guptamani, Sankrail, Uluberia and Singur  for the Nano factory in early 2006. The company chose Singur mainly because of its proximity to Calcutta, although Guptamani had less fertile land.         
	Biswadip Gupta, the CEO and managing director of JSW Bengal, today said the government must provide adequate infrastructure if it wanted industry to come up in backward areas.         
	Mollah signalled intention to table a law barring non-cultivators from buying farmland. I will try to table a bill to stop the sale of large swathes of farmland to non-cultivators in the next session. But I am not sure whether I will be able to do it.        
	He made a distinction between acquisitions for private sector and government-run infrastructure projects. Mollah counted railway projects, now under Trinamul chief Mamata Banerjee, on his list of top priorities for acquisition.

  - Poll feat over, Tawang awaits Dalai Lama visit          ATONU CHOUDHURRI                                          
	Tawang, Oct. 7: Far from the din of hectic canvassing, election in Tawang is for all practical purposes over.        
	Perched on thedizzying heights of 10,000 and 15,000 feet  where the thin air makes even breathing a laboured task for the unaccustomed traveller  Tawang district in Arunachal Pradesh has witnessed a silent march of democracy.         
	All the three constituencies  Tawang, Lumla and Mukto  have sent their representatives uncontested to the Assembly.         
	Among the three successful Congress candidates is chief minister Dorjee Khandu, for whom it is a hattrick from Mukto.         
	The talk in political circles is that Khandu also ensured the uncontested election for veteran Congressman Tewang Dhondup from Tawang constituency and debutante Jambey Tashi from Lumla.        
	Khandus political mentor and three-time MLA from Tawang district, Karma Wangchuk, could not hide his joy over the chief ministers rarest feat.                                       
	Dorjee has grown as a politician within a very short span of time. He used to seek advice from me during his initial years and followed my instructions ardently. Now, it feels great to see him achieving this feat. He has not given a sniffing chance to his detractors to question his maturity as a leader, says 80-year-old Wangchuk.         
	Election worries over, Tawang has other things to concentrate on.         
	People are keeping their fingers crossed for the proposed visit of the Dalai Lama to the Tawang monastery in November.        
	The China scare is palpable.         
	Reports of the Chinese armys intrusion into Indian territory is bothering us. Tawang bore the brunt of Chinese aggression in 1962. I was not even born then but have heard about atrocities of Chinese army from my father, who was barely 16 years old. The tension prevails over the visit of our supreme leader, the Dalai Lama. Last year, too, his visit was cancelled. We really dont know whether this time we will be able to seek his blessings or not, says Sonam Choedon, a 30-year-old businessman who runs a garment shop at Nehru Market in Tawang.        
	Karma Wangchuk, who has met the Dalai Lama eight times since 1952 and fondly remembers his close association with the spiritual leader, sees no reason why China should have any objection to his visit to Tawang.        
	The Dalai Lama has visited Arunachal Pradesh four times and I was fortunate to accompany him to all the places he visited. I first met him in Lhasa in 1952 and since then I have met him seven more times. Every time, I meet him I am humbled by his benign presence and hold dear his preaching. He emphasises so much on stretching out himself for the cause of humanity. I am really astonished why China has objections to his visit to Tawang, says Wangchu, his wizened face crinkling in anger.        
	He reminisces the day, when as a 20-year-old youth, he met the Dalai Lama in Lhasa and the mentor blessed him by touching his head.         
	Wangchu, who along with his family offers hours of prayers in front of the Dalai Lamas photograph everyday, lights hundreds of chhema (candles) so that spiritual leaders visit to Tawang is a smooth affair.        
	The world community has support for the cause of Tibetans and of course China will concede to the proposal of Tibets autonomy, he says.

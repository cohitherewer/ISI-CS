	Aug. 9: Maharashtra and Delhi today decided not to stoke swine flu panic by ordering all schools to close and, instead, left the matter to the schools themselves.        
	Delhi, however, will send an advisory asking schools to please be careful.        
	No we are not planning to close schools at all. However, if some schools have found three to four cases, they can close for some time, chief minister Sheila Dikshit said.        
	Her Maharashtra counterpart, Ashok Chavan, said a blanket closure of schools could spread panic. Two schools in Mumbai and one in Navi Mumbai, however, had already announced brief closures on Saturday after some of their students fell ill with suspected H1N1 infection.        
	Maharashtra, where three swine flu patients have died and three more are critical, is considering allowing private hospitals to treat patients in keeping with government guidelines. A decision can come only after Tuesdays meeting with representatives of private hospitals.        
	Chavans government today decided that sample-testing capacity at the National Institute of Virology, Pune, should be increased from 300 samples a day to 400 a day, and at Mumbais Haffekine Institute from 40 to 150 samples a day.        
	The government has called a meeting of Ganesh mandals and Janmashtami mandals tomorrow to discuss ways of minimising the spread of swine flu. Tens of thousands are expected to participate in the Janmashtami and Ganesh festivals, which start later this month.        
	The Dhirubhai Ambani International School, three of whose students were reported ill with H1N1 virus, sent emails and text messages to parents yesterday saying it would reopen only on August 17. The school has cancelled a science fair.        
	The Matunga-based JB Vaccha School too closed yesterday, as did Apeejay School in Nerul, Navi Mumbai, after one student of each tested positive.        
	With the number of positive cases rising to 782 in the country, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh has asked the Union health ministry to co-ordinate with state governments on ways to control the virus.        
	He told health minister Ghulam Nabi Azad to set up a panel of experts to broadcast correct information on the H1N1 virus.        
	Azad told Singh the country had enough stocks of the anti-viral drug Tamiflu that is believed to work best against H1N1. Consignments of one lakh tablets have been flown to major cities like Delhi, Mumbai, Pune, Chennai, Hyderabad and Bangalore, he told reporters.         
	The government has also decided to make at least 10,000 tablets available to each district that wants it at any point of time. Every state has been asked to open a helpline to inform people about the disease. The Union health ministry will soon launch a website specifically to spread swine flu awareness.        
	The Maharashtra government has decided to increase the capacity of the isolation wards in Mumbai from 140 to 500 if necessary.        
	The special masks worn as a shield against swine flu are in short supply in Maharashtra, and black marketeers are selling ordinary masks at very high prices in Pune, sources said. Pune police have arrested one black marketeer.        
	Chavan asked people not to panic. It must be pointed out that 225 patients have been treated and allowed to go home from hospitals, he said.        
	Fourth death        
	An NRI died of swine flu in Ahmedabad today, taking the country-wide toll from the pandemic to four.        
	Praveen Patel, 43, had arrived from Atlanta in the US 10 days ago. His wife is also being treated for the disease.

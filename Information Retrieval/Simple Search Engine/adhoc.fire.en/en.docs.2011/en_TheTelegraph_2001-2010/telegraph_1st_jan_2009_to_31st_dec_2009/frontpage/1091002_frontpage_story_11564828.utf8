The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Left gifts mayor to Cong
                                                                                                           Left gifts mayor to Cong
  - Mob attacks felicitation venue for councillors           OUR CORRESPONDENT       
	Siliguri, Oct. 1: The Congress today wrested the mayors post from its ally, the Trinamul Congress, after all 17 councillors of the Left Front voted in favour of Gangotri Devi.        
	The chairpersons post, too, went to the Congress which had fielded Sabita Devi Agarwal.        
	That the Left would play a vital role in the election of the mayor was evident yesterday after the Congress and Trinamul failed to broker a deal for the mayors post, paving the way for elections.        
	A speculation doing the rounds in the political circles is that Darjeeling district Congress president Shankar Malakar had worked out the pact with district Left Front convener and municipal affairs minister Asok Bhattacharya.        
	Another group of political observers said the negotiation was made at the Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee-Pranab Mukherjee level. Mukherjee, the Union finance minister, is also the PCC president.        
	Officially, the Congress had written to the Left for support.         
	After we got the letter from Shankar Malakar, we discussed it and decided to support the Congress candidates. We felt it was our responsibility to help end the impasse, said Bhattacharya, his new role of king maker a salve on the humiliation that he had been nursing since the corporation was lost to an anti-Left alliance after 28 years.         
	Trinamul with 14 councillors and one Independent had pitted its district president, Gautam Deb, against Gangotri, whose party had bagged 15 seats. Trinamuls Arindam Mitra had contested for the chairpersons post.         
	The results went in favour of Gangotri Dutta, who secured 32 votes while Gautam Deb got 15 for the mayor post. Sabita Devi Agarwal, who contested for the chairmans post, secured 32 votes. No vote had been polled in favour of Arindam Mitra, the other candidate, said Surendra Gupta, the district magistrate of Darjeeling.        
	Since morning, hundreds of people had assembled on the SMC premises along with party leaders, waiting eagerly for the results. The administration had posted 40 policemen in the area.        
	The election started at 11.15am after all 47 councillors took oath. Tension mounted as news reached the waiting supporters that all 17 Left councillors had voted in favour of the Congress. Some supporters of Trinamul as well as the Congress started abusing the leaders for taking the help of the Left.         
	Half an hour later, the Trinamul councillors marched out, accusing the Congress of entering into a nexus with the CPM.         
	Trinamul chief Mamata Banerjee once used to call the Congress the CPMs B team. She, however, till late last night had banked on a Bowbazar-Sealdah (byelection) repeat, hoping that the Congress would give in at the last minute. But spurred by Raiganj MP Deepa Das Munshi, Mamatas bete noire, the Congress struck to its guns.         
	We will not participate in the election of the chairman and sit in Opposition at the corporation, a Trinamul councillor shouted.         
	Around 300 metres from the SMC office, at Baghajatin Park, a mob ransacked the venue for the felicitation of the newly sworn in councillors.        
	The new mayor said: We will seek cooperation from all councillors in running the civic body. Das Munshi said an appeal had been made to all councillors to vote for the Congress. It is good that they responded, she said.         
	Deb, who lost the mayors post, said the Congress move would have serious political repercussions in the future. People will understand what the Congress did. We are proud to be anti-CPM.        
	Sources in the SMC said if Trinamul sat in Opposition, all 15 Congress councillors would get a post as the civic body had an equal number of posts.

	Bhubaneswar, Sept. 15: South Korean steel major Posco has announced plans to set up a foundation to launch vocational training programmes in an apparent bid to win over local residents who are resisting land acquisition for its proposed 12 MTPA plant near Paradip port.        
	We are going to set up Posco Foundation to take up health, education and vocational training in the area of our operations, Posco chief executive officer Joon Yang Chung told reporters at the state secretariat here this evening after meeting chief minister Naveen Patnaik.        
	It will be a win-win situation both for the local villagers and Posco, he said, adding that the company would engage best consultants for the project.        
	The South Korean steel major had signed an MoU with the Orissa government in June, 2005 for setting up a 12 MTPA steel plant near Paradip port. Billed as the biggest FDI project with an investment of $12 billion, the mega steel plant has, howevern failed to take off due to resistance by local residents.        
	Of the total requirement of 4,004 acre, around 500 acre is private land. So far, the state government has failed to acquire any private land because of the stiff resistance by local residents.        
	Asked whether the land acquisition problem had been solved, Joon said, We know the state government is making all efforts. We will support the state government.        
	The Posco chief held talks with Patnaik today for more than an hour. We did have a very fruitful discussion on how to expedite the Posco Orissa project, he told reporters. However, he refused to spell out details.        
	This was Joons second visit to Orissa. He was here in November, 2005 when he was president of the company.                          
	On August 26, Posco India chairman Dong-He Lee had met the chief minister and reiterated the companys commitment to go ahead with its Orissa project.        
	Scotching rumours that they were looking to move their mega steel plant project out of Orissa, Dong-Hee had said Posco would begin construction early next year.        
	 By end of this year, all the legal barriers will be cleared and probably next year we will start construction work, the Posco India chairman had said.

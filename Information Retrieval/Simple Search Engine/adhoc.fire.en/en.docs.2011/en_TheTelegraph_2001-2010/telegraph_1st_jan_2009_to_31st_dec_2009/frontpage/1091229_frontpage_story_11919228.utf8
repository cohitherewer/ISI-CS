	Karachi, Dec. 28 (Reuters): A suicide bomber blew up a Shia procession in Karachi today, killing at least 25 people, in an attack that underscored multiple security challenges facing the US ally.        
	The assault on the religious march, the third in Pakistans biggest city in as many days, was launched during a difficult time for the government of President Asif Ali Zardari.        
	Last night, militants attacked the capital of Pakistan- Occupied Kashmir, Muzaffarabad, killing 8 people.         
	Al Qaida-linked Taliban militants have killed hundreds of people in bombing in retaliation for a major government offensive in one of their strongholds in mid-October.        
	Officials said the bomb in Karachi exploded on a main road during a Muharram procession despite the presence of thousands of security forces who had been on high alert.        
	Interior minister Rehman Malik said at least 25 people were killed and about 50 wounded in Karachi, a major transit point for military and other supplies to Afghanistan for the US- and Nato-led anti-insurgency effort. Malik said extremists wanted to destabilise Pakistan. Whoever has done this, he cannot be a Muslim. He is worse than an infidel, he told reporters.        
	Television pictures showed a big cloud of smoke over the scene and reporters said angry worshippers attacked journalists and police and set fire to shops.         
	The procession continued towards its destination despite the blast as many women broke down and wept. Authorities had put in place strict security arrangements for Muharram.        
	 Angry mourners from the procession resorted to attacking journalists and police personnel. They also torched five cars. No group has claimed responsibility for the attacks.         
	Karachi has a long history of ethnic and factional violence, although it has been spared the brunt of Taliban attacks over the past couple of years.        
	Karachi police chief Waseem Ahmed appealed for calm. He said the severed head of the suicide bomber had been found. I was walking in front rows when the blast went off about 50 metres away and thick cloud of smoke immediately engulfed the entire spot, said witness Moin Rizvi.        
	Sagheer Ahmed, the Sindh health minister, told Geo News channel that 20 bodies and over 60 injured people were admitted to three hospitals. Rescue officials said over 50 injured were taken to hospitals.         
	Processions by minority Shias in Pakistan are often attacked by majority Sunni militants.         
	Zardari has vowed to end the bloodshed. But he could be further weakened if corruption charges against his close-aides are revived.        
	The United States says Pakistan must crack down harder on militants along the border who cross into Afghanistan and attack U.S.-led troops fighting the Taliban.        
	But Pakistan, which nurtured militants fighting Soviet occupation troops in Afghanistan in the 1980s, sees the Afghan Taliban as leverage against traditional enemy Indias influence in the country.

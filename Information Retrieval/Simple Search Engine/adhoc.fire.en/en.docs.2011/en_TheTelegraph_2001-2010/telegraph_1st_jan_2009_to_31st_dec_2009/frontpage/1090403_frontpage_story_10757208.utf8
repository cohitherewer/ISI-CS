  - Babulal, Koda, Stephen break free          SUDHIR KUMAR MISHRA                                         The three stooges: Madhu Koda, Babulal Marandi, Stephen Marandi                                      
	Chaibasa/Ranchi, April 2: They lived their political lives under the shadow of support from big brothers Congress and BJP.         
	Now, they have chosen to break free and contest on their own  two former chief ministers and one deputy chief minister have plunged in the fray to fight Lok Sabha elections on their own terms.        
	Madhu Koda, Babulal Marandi and Stephen Marandi havent sought the backing of big parties nor are they taking the help of star campaigners.         
	Vowing to add a new dimension to the states electoral politics, the three are pitching for, believe it or not, the development of Jharkhand.        
	Getting my favourite election symbol is secondary, Koda told The Telegraph referring to his choices of scissors, nagara or banana. I treat the entire Singhbhum Lok Sabha constituency as my family. My wife, parents, siblings and even my eight-month-old daughter accompany me in campaigning, said Koda.        
	One would have thought that after leading an unstable government propped up by demanding allies, Kodas popularity would have taken a beating. Far from it. The people of Singhbhum seemed to have welcomed his candidature.         
	No wonder he is getting indirect support from regional parties like the RJD and LJP who are struggling to get a toehold in Jharkhand politics. Using his old ties with the Sangh Parivar and his recent association with the UPA, Koda has succeeded in roping in efficient BJP and Congress workers to his camp. This apart, he is also being unofficially backed by the All Jharkhand Students Union (AJSU), Jharkhand Jan Morcha, et al.                           
	By fielding nominees in Koderma, the Congress, JMM and RJD, have made JVM (P) chief Babulal Marandis job comparatively easier. Three candidates from the UPA will not only help him personally, in Godda, his party candidate, Pradeep Yadav, would also gain from the infighting among local Congress, JMM and BJP workers.         
	We are contesting all the 14 Lok Sabha seats in the state, without caring for who is being benefited indirectly. Our aim will be to install a government at the Centre in which neither the BJP nor the Congress will be in the picture, said Babulal.        
	In Rajmahal, rebel Congressman Thomas Hansda is proving to be a boon for Jharkhand Jan Morcha patron Stephen Marandi, who has already managed to divide the JMM vote bank. The Morcha candidate, Som Marandi, is better placed, now that the RJD has promised a ticket to Hansda.         
	In Chatra, former Speaker Inder Singh Namdhari is proving to be a thorn in the flesh for the JD (U). BJP workers were backing him, upset as they are at having to lose the seat to the JD(U)        
	They are living in a fools paradise, said state JD(U) chief Jaleshwar Mahto, referring to BJP workers citing L K Advanis prediction that the party would win all 14 Lok Sabha seats in Jharkhand.        
	In Chatra, the BJP workers are openly campaigning for Namdhari. Even if they succeed in Chatra, the JD (U) would avenge the humiliation in other constituencies. I have already submitted detailed reports to our party high command, added Jaleshwar.        
	The buzz is that if Koda, Babulal, Stephen and others like them end up winning four to five seats, they will be in a sound bargaining position, thereby scoring a few brownie points and gaining some clout in national politics.

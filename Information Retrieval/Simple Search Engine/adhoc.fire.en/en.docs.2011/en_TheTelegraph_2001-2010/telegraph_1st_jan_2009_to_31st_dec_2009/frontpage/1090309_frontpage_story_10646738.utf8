      EDUCATION
      
	The UPA government has been like no other India has had mdash; a pre-determined construct of separation of powers between Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, the executive head, and Sonia Gandhi, the political boss of the ruling alliance.   
	 Many had predicted early doom for such an experiment. Many others   believed that an lsquo;apolitical rsquo; prime ministership was not the best thing to happen   to a vibrant democracy which is used to the head of government maintaining   a direct and dynamic political relationship with the masses.   
	 Manmohan Singh rsquo;s oft-perceived aversion to mass politics, through   instruments of the Congress or directly, remains, in critics rsquo; books, one of the greatest drawbacks of the UPA. Some contend, though, that it is precisely   the insulation of the head of government from tasks of day-to-day political   management that allowed the government to focus on issues of governance.  
	 Value Judgement is a specially commissioned series in which   The Telegraph rsquo;s correspondents assess how well, or poorly, the Manmohan Singh government fared in key areas of governance.   
	New Delhi, March 8: Ninety-eight students last year joined the brand new IIT in Bihar, opened with five others to increase access to the institutes like never before.  
	But along with some of the toughest math sums engineering courses offer in India, the students also had to battle water-logging that plagued their hastily selected temporary campus.        
	India is riding an unprecedented boom in educational opportunities thanks to policy decisions under UPA rule that have significantly improved access to schooling and higher education for most citizens.        
	But Manmohan Singhs outgoing government has failed to find a cogent strategy to prevent the education explosion from turning into a cancer that could eviscerate its foundations.        
	Is politicisation of education unavoidable? Can India ensure schooling for all its children? And should institutions of excellence in higher education remain tiny islands inaccessible to most?        
	Over the past five years, the UPA government had to try and answer these questions and many more. It answered some decisively and floundered with the others.        
	But the most volatile question the Prime Minister and his education minister Arjun Singh faced involved the definition of merit. The UPA introduced 27 per cent seat reservation in higher education for poor Other Backward Class (OBC) students amid protests, litigation and fissures within the cabinet.        
	A year after the quotas were enforced, opposition to OBC reservation remains a reality on most Indian campuses (and off them), occasionally taking the ugly form of caste-based victimisation of reserved category students.        
	But even quota opponents accept that the reservation may be irreversible, and academics and recruiters from top companies say the quotas are unlikely to affect the brand value associated with an IIT or an IIM, as had been feared.        
	The Prime Minister set up a body, the National Knowledge Commission, specifically to prepare a blueprint for Indias transformation into a global knowledge hub. Some of the commissions recommendations have been implemented; others still face opposition from within the government.        
	Next June, India will have completed the almost miraculous feat of starting eight new IITs in a little over 12 months  it had seven till 61 years after Independence.        
	Many other new institutions of excellence, promised under the 11th Five Year Plan, have either been launched or are in the pipeline (see chart).        
	But simplistic execution of the argument the government has used to justify this expansion  an increasing demand and the need to correspondingly increase supply  is already hurting India.        
	Unauthorised higher education institutions have mushroomed across the country with government babus acting middlemen and pushing through hundreds of requests from sub-standard institutions citing this argument.        
	A Pune group of institutions uses the acronym of one of the worlds best-known institutes of technology, and claimed that politicians ranging from Arjun Singh and Rahul Gandhi to L.K. Advani and A.B. Bardhan were on its faculty.        
	It falsely claimed to its students that it was commended by Arjuns human resource development ministry. Its courses were not recognised by the government, and when exposed by this newspaper, the institution corrected itself under pressure from an embarrassed Arjun.        
	Education officials estimate that at least 500 fake higher education institutions continue to make false promises or claims before students and their families.        
	Dozens of dubious educational institutions have been granted deemed-to-be university status -- ministry officials jokingly refer to these as doomed universities -- entitling them to government funds without having to adhere to the norms required from universities.        
	Quality shines through, however, in the new textbooks drafted by the National Council for Educational Research and Training under the National Curriculum Framework, revised in 2005 under Arjuns de-saffronisation drive.        
	Using cartoon strips and popular themes like Bollywood and cricket to teach, these books  across classes and courses  are today accepted throughout the country and abroad as models for modern-day school textbooks.        
	The Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan, started by the NDA, was continued and today India has over 95 per cent primary school enrolment, though retention rates lag at about 75 per cent.        
	Central schools have been opened in Muslim-dominated areas, and 3,500 girls hostels have been cleared by the cabinet. The UPA has also announced plans to start 6,000 model schools across the country.        
	In December 2008, it tabled in Parliament the much-awaited Right to Education Bill. And minutes before the announcement of the Lok Sabha polls, the UPA launched its largest new education scheme  the Rashtriya Madhyamik Shiksha Abhiyan (RMSA)  to universalise secondary education.        
	However, during the past five years, sub-standard schools too have flourished more than ever before and the government has little or no control over the fees they charge. Also, the government is yet to come up with a concrete plan to ensure quality at the new model schools it plans to open.        
	The new government that takes over by June 2 will have the responsibility of implementing the landmark RMSA and the proposed Right to Education law once it is approved by Parliament.        
	The new rulers will have to execute the remainder of the 11th Plan, described by Manmohan Singh as an education plan. And they will have to tackle the proliferation of substandard institutions that has reached dangerous proportions.        
	But first, they will need to focus on education the way the outgoing government has.

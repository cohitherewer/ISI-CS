                                                                                                           Sonia blows hot and cold 
  - Cong chief woos with dreams, flays small parties           OUR BUREAU                                          
	April 13: Congress president Sonia Gandhi today made a whirlwind tour of three northeastern states a day before campaigning comes to a close for 10 of the 24 seats in the region going to the hustings in the first phase of parliamentary elections on April 16.        
	Sonia chanted the development mantra and ridiculed the shifting allegiance of smaller parties, asking people to avoid them, as she addressed rallies in Itanagar, Shillong and Silchar.        
	In Itanagar, where she kicked off her campaign in the region, Sonia harped on the Congress-led UPA governments development initiatives for the Northeast as a whole and Arunachal Pradesh in particular.         
	Addressing an election rally at the Indira Gandhi Park, she claimed that only the Congress could provide a strong, stable, development-oriented government at the Centre that could expedite development in the region.         
	She focused on the achievements of the UPA government over the past five years, saying the Congress-led UPA government had taken utmost care of the economic and development needs of the people of the state.         
	Her speech, devoid of the usual BJP bashing, focused more on the close ties between the Gandhi family and the tribal people of the state.        
	In Shillong, which was next on her itinerary, Sonia expressed concern over the shifting loyalties of small parties and individuals that caused instability in the state.         
	She did not directly refer to Presidents rule.         
	Addressing a public rally at Jawaharlal Nehru Stadium for the partys Shillong Lok Sabha candidate, Vincent Pala, she said, I hope you will choose wisely and reject all those individuals and small groupings having shifting loyalties who are here today and elsewhere tomorrow.         
	She added that only the Congress could bring political stability and development to the state.         
	The crowd at the rally was thin with the HNLC bandh affecting normal life in Shillong.         
	She again referred to the Gandhi family as she reminded people that it was her mother-in-law who gave statehood to Meghalaya.         
	She said the Congress was committed to making Meghalaya a major destination in the field of information technology, tap the states tourism potential and construct a world class airport in Shillong.         
	She said the international nuclear deal signed by the UPA could enhance electricity generation and end power cuts in the state.                                            
	Addressing a rally at Silchar in south Assam, the UPA chairperson said the Congress-led government at the Centre and the Assamese people were inextricably bound together in a whole for making the future of the state a fruitful one.         
	She said the significance of this poll lies in its charting of the ways to determine the future of this country and urged all to vote judiciously for her party so that it could again be the bandwagon in the progress of the nation.         
	She said development was the main creed of her party and poverty alleviation its main goal.         
	Addressing the modest poll rally of about 4,000 at the India Club ground, she recalled the contributions of the people of Assam to the struggle for Independence.

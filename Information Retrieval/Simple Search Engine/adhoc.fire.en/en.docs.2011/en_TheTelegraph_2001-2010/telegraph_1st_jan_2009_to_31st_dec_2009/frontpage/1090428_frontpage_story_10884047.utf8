	Ranchi, April 27: CRPF deputy inspector-general Alok Raj has said they are ready for a magisterial probe into the circumstances that led to the death of five villagers in Latehar, indications that the shadow of the April 15 anti-Maoist combing operation still hovers over tomorrows repoll in 116 booths of the state.        
	We know the truth. Let the people of the state also know the truth through the magisterial probe, Raj told The Telegraph while getting his men  56 companies  to ensure peaceful repolling.        
	The Centre has agreed to Jharkhands request and replaced the BSF with the CRPF as they were better equipped to navigate the states Maoist-infested terrain.        
	Of the nine members of paramilitary forces killed in the first phase, seven belonged to the BSF. The CRPF are more suited for anti-insurgency operations. Moreover, they have been stationed in Jharkhand before, said a senior police officer.        
	Maoist groups had paralysed life in Palamau and Latehar districts  they also took a passenger train hostage for four hours on April 22  to protest against the CRPF operation on the day before the first phase of voting.        
	Under pressure, the state ordered a magisterial inquiry even though it was yet to name an officer to head it. And Governor Syed Sibtey Razi, heading the administration of the state now under Presidents rule, was away in New Delhi.                                                              
	Raj, who headed the CRPF when it was deployed in Bengals troubled Nandigram in May last year, said they took a hit here due to tactical errors and not due to any Maoist offensive.        
	Had the forces followed the thumb rule, like not boarding their vehicle on a kaccha road or not defusing landmines on their own, the first phase of elections, too, would have been peaceful, Raj asserted.        
	One cannot say the Maoists had an upper hand in these elections, he insisted, as there was no direct confrontation with them except in Khunti. We learnt our lessons and the second phase remained more or less peaceful.        
	But joint chief electoral officer Ashok Kumar Sinha admitted tomorrows repolling was a challenge even though adequate security arrangements had been made.         
	No repolling is being held at booths with either zero voting or where voters boycotted elections. The job is nevertheless challenging as polling at many of these booths were cancelled due to Naxalite violence, Sinha said.        
	Repolling is being held in as many as 116 booths that went to polls in the two phases of voting in the state.        
	Among them, five polling stations are in the Chatra constituency, including a booth at Hata (Latehar) in which four election personnel had been kidnapped, but later released. And at Manjar (booth 156) where officials could not reach after six BSF men were killed in a landmine blast.        
	Repolling will also be held at Halom in Raina (booth 124) in the Khunti constituency, the site of an encounter between rebels and police. At other booths, Maoist had torched EVMs.

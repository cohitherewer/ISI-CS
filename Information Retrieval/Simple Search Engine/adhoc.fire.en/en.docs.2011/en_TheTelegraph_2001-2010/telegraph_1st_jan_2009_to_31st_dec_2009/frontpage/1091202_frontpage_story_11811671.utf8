The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | I am Kalam but I am not acting (like politicians)
                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                I am Kalam but I am not acting (like politicians)

	Mumbai. Dec. 1: For long, it has been a one-way street: Bollywood actors with stagnating careers have moved from the arc light to seek limelight in the political arena.        
	Now the traffic has begun moving from the other side too. There is a sudden realisation that cinema provides a handy platform for public attention that politicians seek so much.        
	The latest public figure, if not politician, to make his acting debut could be former President A.P.J. Abdul Kalam  if claims from Tinsel Town are to be believed.        
	Bollywood bad man Gulshan Grover had announced that Kalam was playing himself in a cameo appearance in Main Hoon Kalam (I Am Kalam), an Indo-French joint venture supported by Unicef.        
	A week on, however, Kalams office hotly denied it. Kalam has no plans to act or associate with any film. The news is only speculation and it is the individuals imagination with a business motive, a statement from his office said last week.        
	Grover, who acts in the film along with French actress Sophi Brosstel and some child actors, says he stands by his claim.        
	The film has been made (with) Kalams blessings and has been inspired by his story. He has given a shot as himself in the movie though he has not acted as an actor. Its a cameo appearance, Grover said on Saturday.        
	The film, directed by Nila Madhu Panda and presented by the Smile Foundation, has been shot in Rajasthan and revolves around a young boy who is inspired by a speech from Kalam to dream big.        
	Indian politicians, however, have been acting in movies for sometime. Jammu and Kashmirs young chief minister, Omar Abdullah, flirted with Bollywood last year, appearing as himself in the out-and-out masala flick Mission Istanbul.        
	Omar has said he acted in the movie, which failed at the box office, as a favour to childhood friend and Bollywood director Apurva Lakhia.        
	While Omar  and allegedly Kalam  play themselves, Samajwadi Party leader Amar Singh seems to be turning acting into an alternative career. After fighting Maoists in the Bengali flick Sesh Sanghat, he is all pepped up for his next release where he gets to live a dream.        
	The Uttar Pradesh politician, who has never been a Union minister despite his party propping up several governments, plays home minister in Chargesheet. His co-actors are Dev Anand and Bengals own Riya Sen.        
	An actor is a sensitive human being. I do not care whether he is a politician or belongs to any other profession as long as he can act. Amar Singh has done a good job in the movie and I hope to release it early next year, said Dev Anand, the producer-director of Chargesheet.        
	One politician who has earned critics acclaim for her performance in a film is the CPMs Brinda Karat.        
	Brinda, who plays Konkona Sens adoptive mother in Amu, a film about the 1984 killing of Sikhs, is perhaps the only politician who has not played a politician in films so far.        
	The West has not been far behind. Former US presidential candidate John McCain, before he took a dig at Barack Obama by calling him a celebrity, had acted as himself in the raunchy Hollywood flick Wedding Crashers.        
	Kalam, allegedly, will only make an inspiring speech for children.

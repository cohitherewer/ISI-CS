          PTI OUR BUREAU                              
	Melbourne/New Delhi, Sept. 25: An Australian football star who assaulted an Indian taxi driver after night-long drinking was described by the Premier of Victoria as a good kid who had had too much to drink.        
	Michael Hurley, who plays for Essendon, a mid-ranking club in the Australian league, allegedly punched and kicked the taxi driver over a fare dispute in Melbourne, the capital of Victoria.        
	The assault coincided with the visit to India by John Brumby, the Premier of Victoria, who faced questions about the latest in a spate of attacks on Indians in Australia.        
	I understand that Hurley is a good kid. He is deeply remorseful. It is not typical of his behaviour...but he had too much to drink, he said.        
	Hurley, 19, took a taxi outside a south Melbourne nightclub about 5.30am, emerging from a TV show after-party, and went to a fast-food outlet. He left the taxi for food and when the driver pursued him asking for fare, Hurley allegedly kicked him in the groin and punched him, according to The Herald Sun.        
	Hurley was arrested outside the fast-food outlet and questioned about the incident before being released.        
	The local media did not identify the Indian cab driver who is said to have received minor injuries.        
	Essendon has described the players behaviour as disappointing and unacceptable. Its managing director Peter Jackson said: We are extremely disappointed that Michael was out so late and that he put himself in a situation where an incident occurred.         
	He started drinking at the Grand Final Footy Show after-party and by nights end he had clearly had too much to drink, Jackson said. The club will continue speaking with Michael and he will assist police anyway he can.        
	Hurley, considered one of Essendons emerging stars, left the police station just before midday via a side exit to avoid the media and was driven away, said a local report.        
	Brumby, who met overseas Indian affairs minister Vayalar Ravi today, said: The incident is regrettable and definitely concrete action would follow.        
	His apparent explanation that Hurley was a good kid who acted this way because he had drunk too much might be seen as a statement aimed at distancing the attack from charges of racism, but Brumby had to face some harsh criticism from the Indian minister.        
	Officials present at the meeting said Ravi made it clear that the governments position so far that the attacks on Indians were stray law-and-order incidents had become untenable.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Answer to air power: Leader
                                                                                                           Answer to air power: Leader
          OUR BUREAU                              
	Oct. 2: The Maoists are daring the government to come at them even with air power and have cited the killings in Bihar as an example of the tactic they will adopt to break an encirclement by security forces.        
	A person claiming to be Maoist politburo member Kishan phoned The Telegraph this evening and said the Indian Air Force chiefs request to the government for permission to use firepower is an excuse to bomb vast areas where the security forces have not been able to march in but we will break out of our traditional areas and enter new areas  as in Khagaria  to encircle the government troops.        
	The air force chief had spoken of seeking permission to shoot at Maoists yesterday. It raises the question whether the Maoists could have planned the Khagaria operation in such a short time, or whether Kishan was citing it just as an example that could be repeated in the future.        
	For eight years, security forces have been trying to enter a territory of 20,000sqkm in Dandakaranya, Kishan said. Now that they have not been able to march in, the government is planning to use air power to bomb us, he added.

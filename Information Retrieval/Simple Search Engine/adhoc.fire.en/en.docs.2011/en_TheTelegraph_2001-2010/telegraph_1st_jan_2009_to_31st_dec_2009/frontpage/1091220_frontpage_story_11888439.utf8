	New Delhi, Dec. 19: The Congress leadership is overjoyed by the inputs they have received from Jharkhand and has already begun the exercise of managing the shortfall in reaching the magic figure of 41, but JMM chief Shibu Soren could well emerge as kingmaker in the search for numbers.         
	The high voter turnout in the last phase of elections has bolstered the partys hopes and senior leaders claimed it should be in a position to sew up a majority, basing their views on field reports and exit poll findings that were more encouraging than the pre-poll assessment.        
	I am overwhelmed by the final report. We should definitely be 35 plus and our coalition will now emerge as the single-largest, a proposition that looked unlikely in the beginning. We hope to get a few clean independents and others who too want to provide a secular and stable government, Keshav Rao, the AICC in-charge of Jharkhand, told The Telegraph.        
	 Other leaders arent that confident and foresee Guruji emerging as the true kingmaker. They endorse Keshav Raos view that the final assessment was much better than the initial expectation but still fear that they would require Soren and Lalu Prasad to form the government.         
	Both are problems; while Sorens presence will inject a sense of instability, Lalu Prasad brings the Bihar factor into play. We were keen to avoid both, said a senior leader.        
	Congress leaders say Lalu would be more than happy to extend unconditional support as his primary objective is to somehow nestle into the UPA lap. But the Congress now does not want any understanding with the RJD in Bihar and his association with the Jharkhand government can blur the dividing line.        
	Soren carries a different kind of political baggage and his commitment too is doubtful  the JMM chief wont have any ideological reservation in striking a deal with the BJP.        
	Though Lalu himself claims that the RJD would cross 10-12 seats, the Congress does not expect him to bag more than five. The JMM, Congress sources say, can touch 10. If these figures have any sanctity, the BJP is in for significant losses.        
	Union minister and the only Congress MP from Jharkhand, Subodh Kant Sahay, said, The BJP will obviously lose heavily if we are gaining. Our assessment is that the BJP-JD(U) cannot emerge as the single-largest group this time and we would be definitely in a position to form the government.        
	Keshav Rao, however, expects the voters to give a clearer verdict than that. He said, Voters have suffered a lot and the 2009 Lok Sabha verdict showed their craving for a stable government. We dont expect Jharkhand voters to behave differently at a time when the BJP was undoubtedly on the decline.        
	The Congresss state in-charge listed out what he thought were the factors in their favour. The partys alliance with Babulal Marandi, he felt, worked very well on the ground and together they conducted a good campaign. The new governor, K. Sankaranarayanans performance was also very effective and the administration did a lot for the common people, he added.

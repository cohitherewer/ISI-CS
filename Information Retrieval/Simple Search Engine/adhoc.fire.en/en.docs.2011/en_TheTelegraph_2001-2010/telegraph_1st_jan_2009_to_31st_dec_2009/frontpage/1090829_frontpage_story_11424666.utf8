                                                                                                           Leaders at Sangh door
                            
	New Delhi, Aug. 28: Sangh chief Mohan Bhagwats firm indication that he would like his agenda for leadership change to be implemented sooner rather than later triggered panic in the BJP with top leaders running to him late tonight for a clearer understanding of his mind.         
	Four staunch supporters of L.K. Advani  Arun Jaitley, Sushma Swaraj, Venkaiah Naidu and Ananth Kumar  had a two-hour meeting with the RSS chief. Although what transpired in the meeting was not revealed, party sources said these leaders presented a strong case for Advanis continuance or at least an honourable exit at a time of his choice. The leaders later held a meeting with Advani.         
	Sangh sources said Bhagwat stuck to his position and asked the leaders to finalise the succession plan. They said the RSS chief stressed the need for Advanis exit.

	Ranchi/Jamshedpur, Feb. 6: Rebels today blew up an anti-landmine vehicle at Baruhatu under Bundu police station area, 50km from here, severely injuring five policemen.        
	The blast took place when the vehicle, carrying nine policemen, was on its way to Baruhatu picket from Bundu police station around 3pm to drop an assistant sub-inspector, Prem Kumar Mishra. Mishra was also injured.         
	Besides Mishra, the others injured include driver Manoj Kumar Dubey, constables Ravi Kumar Singh and Govind Ram and chowkidar Bheem Aheer.         
	The injured have been admitted to RIMS and three of them were said to be in a critical condition. Ram and Aheer suffered minor aches on their backs.         
	While Mishra, Dubey and Singh were seriously injured, said a RIMS doctor while talking to an officer on special duty to the health secretary, S.K. Choudhary.         
	Police sources said the incident took place some 5km from the Bundu police station. There is a culvert 5km from the station. The explosives were kept in a milk can hidden under the culvert. As soon as the vehicle reached the culvert, rebels triggered the blast, an officer said.        
	President of Jharkhand Police Association Kamlesh Singh said the blast could have left a worse impact had the policemen not been on an anti-land mine vehicle.         
	Bandh call         
	CPI(Maoist) has called a Jharkhand bandh on February 9 to protest against alleged police atrocities on villagers in Lalgarh, bordering West Midnapore district of Bengal, and to cement a demand for a Greater Jharkhand. The bandh has been restricted to the state, while Bengal and Orissa have been exempted.

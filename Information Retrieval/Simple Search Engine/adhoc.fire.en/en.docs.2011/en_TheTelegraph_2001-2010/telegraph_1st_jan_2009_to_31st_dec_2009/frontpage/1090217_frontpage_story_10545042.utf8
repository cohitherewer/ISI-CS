										      Nondon Bagchi celebrates over two decades of dolly rsquo;s the tea shop.                       A glimpse of Dolly rsquo;s The Tea Shop;                           
	It is an evening in October, 1998. I am walking, in search of a taxi, towards the Dhakuria bridge, just outside the Dakshinapan shopping complex, when I start feeling a bit strange. Hot flushes. Cold sweats. Faster heartbeat. A giddy-headed euphoria alternating with slight disorientation. All these sensations not acute or disturbing, but mild  just about there. I wonder whats going on, and then it hits me.        
	Im high. On tea! I have just over-indulged at Dolly Roys tea boutique inside the shopping complex; I have put away umpteen cups and glasses of some wonderful concoctions, and the caffeine, though present in minuscule amounts in tea, has done this to me (I always have to go easy on my coffee intake), simply because of the volume I have consumed.         
	Spiced tea, made by boiling cardamom, cinnamon and cloves in water and adding tea liquor, tempered with lemon or ginger. Orange and Mint, made with essence of orange, lemon, sugar syrup, tea liquor concentrate and crushed mint leaves. Fruit Cup, an iced preparation with tea liquor concentrate as the base and flavoured with essence of mango, pineapple, strawberry and orange and lemon juice. Pineapple Pitcher, a similar drink, also iced, with tea liquor, lemon juice, unsweetened pineapple juice, Angostura bitters and sugar syrup. Tea Float, a combination of iced tea and ice cream. Tea Punch  various essences plus sugar syrup and tea liquor. And then there was more                  A cup of cheer. 
      
	Dollys The Tea Shop is the precise name of the place, and this month they celebrated their 21st birthday. Set up on February 3, 1988 by Dolly Roy, Indias first lady tea taster and the worlds first lady tea auctioneer, it has become more than an institution in the city. There were no other tea boutiques in the city 21 years ago and the concept was unique.         
	Not just a place where you could enjoy your favourite cuppa, you could also buy a kilo or two of your favourite leaf from every tea-growing region in the country; make on-the-spot blends of your choice and also enjoy a round or few of tasting before coming to a decision.        
	Delicately flavoured Darjeeling teas, robust Assam teas, solid CTC varieties from the Dooars, fragrant Nilgiri teas, esoteric Kangra Valley varieties as well as unfermented green teas.        
	A novel concept started at Dollys was tea as a gift for just about any occasion, tastefully packaged in wooden chestlets, cane baskets, carved wooden boxes, papier mache boxes, jute pouches, earthenware and so on. Dollys teas found their way into wedding trousseaus, and were given on traditional occasions like Jamai Sashthi and also on not-so-traditional occasions like Teachers Day.                    Dolly sips on a hot cuppa      
	Twenty-one years have gone by and virtually nothing has changed, except that things have just got better from more or less every aspect. Even more varieties have been introduced such as Makaibari Silver Tips; designer teas like Flower Tea, Pearl Tea and Stupa Tea are now available. Clientele has grown and the homely, cosy and inviting atmosphere of the shop where even the all-womens team is the same, now hosts school and university students, artists, actors, authors, intellectuals, experts from the consulates, people from the corporate world and tourists from far and wide who have read about Dollys in travel guides like The Lonely Planet and others.        
	The menu has also grown, with almost 60 preparations of hot and iced varieties now, and an important development here is that they have a selection of sandwiches, snacks and salads available. I had a ham sandwich, which was excellent.         
	The foremost reason for the success of Dollys The Tea Shop has to be the impeccable credentials and high level of savvy of Dolly herself, who started tasting 39 years ago, up to 14 hours a day, till tea ran in her veins.        
	Ask her and she says, Im just a tea-total person.       WHATS YOUR MESSAGE FOR DOLLYS AT 21? TELL t2abpmail.com

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Missing face at EMS centenary
                                                                                                           Missing face at EMS centenary
          JOHN MARY                               
	Thiruvananthapuram, June 13: The CPM today observed the birth centenary of E.M.S. Namboodiripad, the Marxist ideologue and the worlds first elected communist chief minister, but V.S. Achuthanandan, Kerala chief minister and the senior-most politburo member after Jyoti Basu, was missing from the dais.         
	Not that Achuthanandan, locked in a feud with the party boss in Kerala, did not get his message across on what should otherwise have been a poignant moment in the history of the communist movement in India  even for a party that tries not to lay too much stress on individuals but is ritual-bound when it comes to its pantheon.         
	Achuthanandan recorded his tribute to EMS by writing in Matrubhoomi, a mainstream newspaper controlled by a person now out of favour with the party, after the chief ministers article was apparently shunned by a CPM organ.         
	Matrubhoomi is owned by Veerendra Kumar of the Janata Dal (Secular).         
	The faction led by Pinarayi Vijayan, the state CPM secretary, had denied Veerendra Kumar a ticket for the election, although he was the sitting MP from Kozhikode . Subsequently, the CPM-led Left Democratic Front has made it clear that the JD(S) minus Veerendra Kumar is its ally.         
	The chief minister was not invited to the party programme, sources said. Achuthanandan has been non-committal about toeing the party line to back Vijayan who is facing trial in the multi-crore Lavalin scam.         
	Prakash Karat, the first CPM general secretary with roots in Kerala after EMS, and politburo colleague S. Ramachandran Pillai attended the centenary held in the northern Malappuram district. This is the first public event Karat has attended since governor R.S. Gavai gave the CBI the nod to prosecute Vijayan.         
	As it became evident that the centenary had become a platform for divisiveness in the party, the CPMs Malappuram unit said the state committee had organised the programme. The local leadership had no say in drawing the guest list, it said.         
	But an EMS quote in a promotional being beamed on the CPM-backed television channel, appeared to carry a message for the Achuthanandan camp. The quote said: For 60 years, I have been holding aloft the party flag/ I have been trying hard to bring in socialism/ But the day I turn against the party, I know you all will turn against me.         
	Karat did not offer a direct comment on the infighting, choosing to talk about the poll drubbing. The party, wherever it is in power, will initiate corrective measures in the party and the government, imbibing lessons from the poll reverses, he said.         
	Pillai, when prodded by the media at the airport, said: The party has not thought of any change in the leadership, either in government or in the organisation.         
	The duos one-liners were in contrast to Achuthanandans pointed comments in Matrubhoomi. There was no anti-incumbency sentiment during the elections because of the huge development and welfare programmes launched by the government. Yet the party suffered huge setbacks, even in its strongholds.         
	We must take cues from reverses and administer correctives through criticism and self-criticism. But criticism, bereft of self-criticism, hampers the march forward, he said, possibly hinting that the dominant faction led by Vijayan was unrepentant.         
	With Achuthanandan and Vijayan targeting one another, the politburo may have to step in again. It had suspended the duo two years ago for indiscipline and bickering in public.         
	Although the official line from the central committee to the branch committees is that the Lavalin scam is politically motivated, Achuthanandan has been unconvinced. He has told the politburo that Vijayan should quit as state secretary till he is cleared of all charges.         
	Vijayan must face trial and prove his innocence than fight the judiciary, he has said.         
	On the other hand, Vijayans faction has been arguing that Achuthanandan breached the Leninist principles of collective responsibility.         
	The latest barb  with language similar to that used in the Soviet era for witch-hunts  came from LDF convener Vaikom Viswan today: Those who court indifference when the leader of the communist party is under attack are enemies of the party. Such people even pretend to save the party.         
	The day was significant for the party and the state for another reason. Saturday was the 50th anniversary of the Liberation Struggle, a movement launched by the Christians and other opponents of the communists in the late 1950s, that led to the dismissal of the first EMS government by the Centre. The Church and the CPM are back again on collision course over alleged government interference in education.         
	The day was also tinged by personal tragedy for Vijayan. His elder brother passed away today.

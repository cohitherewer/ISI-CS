The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | If its icons, Buddha does care abouthis office wall 
                                                                                                           If its icons, Buddha does care about his office wall 
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                            Tagore, Netaji                                
	Calcutta, March 31: Worried about someone defacing your wall? Just adorn it with portraits of Rabindranath Tagore and Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose.        
	No less a person than chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee can be counted upon to move heaven, earth and the Election Commission  probably through the chief secretary  if someone dares to erase the pictures.        
	Or so it would seem from the outraged response of the chief minister after government offices were advised by the poll panel to remove all photographs except those of Mahatma Gandhi, the incumbent President and the governor till the polls were over.         
	Asked about the EC fiat, Bhattacharjee said at Writers Buildings: This is simply absurd. I cannot remove the pictures of Rabindranath Tagore and Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose from Writers Buildings. I will not remove them. I have asked the chief secretary to enquire about the directive. I wont obey such orders.        
	Earlier, the state chief electoral officer had said: The Election Commission has sent an instruction that says... no pictures or calendar having images of the Prime Minister, chief minister, ministers or any other political personality will be allowed in government offices and buildings till the Lok Sabha elections are over.        
	Asked whether he will remove his own pictures from the state secretariat, Bhattacharjee said: My pictures are nowhere. However, I wont remove them (if there are any).        
	Pictures of Bhattacharjee participating in government programmes have been framed and put up along the corridor he walks down to his chamber every day. Around the chief ministers chamber, the pictures of Tagore, Subhas Chandra Bose, Chittaranjan Das and Benoy-Badal-Dinesh adorn the walls.         
	The chief ministers pledge to protect what he considers his right to decide the dcor of his public office stands out in sharp contrast with his silence on the citizens right to protect the walls of their houses.        
	Many parties, including that of the chief minister, have flouted the commissions rules on graffiti. In fact, the commission had earlier caved in under pressure from such parties and diluted a blanket ban on graffiti on houses.        
	The commission may well adopt a sympathetic attitude, letting the chief minister preserve his working environment and possibly win some admirers  and votes  for standing up for the icons of Bengal.        
	But communists relationship with Netaji had not always been a pretty picture. In 1942, the then undivided Communist Party of India had called Netaji Quisling  a name that had become synonymous with traitor. But the reference was withdrawn by the CPM many years later.

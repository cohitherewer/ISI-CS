  - AIG stars feel hostility in community after bonus storm           JAMES BARRON AND RUSS BUETTNER                        A protester in front of an AIG office in Washington. (Reuters) 				                                       
	New York, March 20: The AIG executive who was nicknamed Jackpot Jimmy by a New York tabloid walked up the driveway towards his bay-windowed house in Fairfield, Connecticut, on Thursday afternoon.        
	How do I feel? said James Haas, the executive of the insurance giant which is at the centre of a bonus payment storm in the US, repeating the question he had just been asked. I feel horrible. This has been a complete invasion of privacy.        
	Haas walked on, his pink shirt a burst of colour on a slate-gray afternoon. The words came haltingly. You have to understand, he said, there are kids involved, there have been death threats.... His voice trailed off. It looked as if he was fighting back tears.        
	I didnt have anything to do with those credit problems, said Haas, 47. I told Mr Liddy  Edward M. Liddy, the chief executive of AIG (American International Group)  I would rescind my retention contract.         
	He ended the conversation with a request: Leave my neighbours alone.        
	Too late. Jean Wieson, who has lived down the block for 24 years, had stopped her car in front of Haass house before he arrived home. She was angry about the millions of dollars in bonuses paid to its executives, the credit-default swaps that brought AIG to its knees, the $170 billion the federal government has spent to prop it up.        
	It makes me absolutely sick, she said. Its despicable. Its disgusting what these people have done. They should be forced to give every cent back.              
	Those bonuses in years past helped make AIG executives into prominent local citizens. They own big houses like Haass, with its three chimneys and its views. Some are well-known contributors to arts groups and private schools in Connecticut communities not far from the office park that is the workplace of many of the employees in AIGs financial products division  the eye of the bonus storm.        
	Now these executives are toxic, and those communities are rattled and divided. Private security guards have been stationed outside their houses, and sometimes the local police drive by.         
	AIG employees at the companys office tower in Lower Manhattan were told to avoid leaving the building while a demonstration was going on outside. The memo also advised them to avoid displaying company-issued ID cards when they left the office and to abandon tote bags or other items with the AIG logo.        
	One AIG executive, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because he feared the consequences of identifying himself, said many workers felt demonised and betrayed. It is as bad if not worse than McCarthyism, he said, referring to the witch-hunt over un-American activities during the 1950s.        
	Everyone has sacrificed the employees of AIGs financial products division, he said, for their own political agenda.        
	The publics anger, he said, is coming from bad facts as a result of someone elses agenda  or just bad facts, period. Instead, he said, the so-called bonuses were in fact just payments that had been promised long ago to workers, including technical and administrative assistants.        
	There may be more protests. The Connecticut Working Families party, which has support from organised labour, is planning a bus tour of AIG executives homes on Saturday, with a stop at the companys office.        
	Were going to be peaceful and lawful in everything we do, said Jon Green, the director of Connecticut Working Families. I know theres a lot of anger and a lot of rage about whats happened. Were not looking to foment that unnecessarily, but what we want to do is give folks who are struggling and losing their homes and their jobs and their health insurance an opportunity to see what kinds of lifestyle billions of dollars in credit-default swaps can buy.         
	AIG paid the $165 million in bonuses to 463 of its executives, but in the uproar that erupted when the payments were made public, Liddy asked the employees to return much of that money. He said that many of them have agreed to do so.         
	The largest single bonus check, for $6.4 million, went to Douglas L. Poling, an executive vice-president for energy and infrastructure investments. An AIG spokesman said Poling had told him he was returning the bonus because he thought it was the correct thing to do.        
	Gerry Pasciucco, a former Morgan Stanley vice-chairman who was brought in by Liddy to wind down the financial products unit, said Poling had sold off roughly 80 per cent of the units assets. Pasciucco said the money from the sales would go to the government.        
	Hes done an outstanding job in winding down his investment books, Pasciucco said. He did it at the right time, and weve made money. We would be losing money today if we waited to sell some of these assets.        
	Polings father, Harold A. Poling, retired as the chief executive of Ford Motor Company in 1994. On Thursday, Cheryle Campbell answered the phone at Harold Polings house in Michigan, where she said she had worked as a housekeeper for 20 years. She said she was not surprised to hear that Douglas Poling had decided to give back his bonus.        
	Youd think, being in the kind of job he is, that hed be one of those sharks, she said. But hes not at all.         
	Douglas Poling has lived in the same house on a dead-end street in Fairfield for 11 years. The local papers say that he and his wife have given generously to a homeless shelter and to a boys prep school.         
	But on Thursday, his house, like Haass, was being watched by private security guards.

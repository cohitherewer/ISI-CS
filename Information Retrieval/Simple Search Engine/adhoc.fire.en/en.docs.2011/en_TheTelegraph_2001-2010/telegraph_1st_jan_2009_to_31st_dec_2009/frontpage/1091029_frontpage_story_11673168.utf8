The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Something Indianny for Patil
                                                                                                           Something Indianny for Patil
          AMIT ROY                            St Georges Hall at Windsor Castle, where the Queen hosted the banquet for President Pratibha Patil                                  
	Windsor, Oct. 28: Short of wearing a sari it was the next best thing the Queen could have done when she hosted a glittering banquet for President Pratibha Patil at Windsor Castle last night.        
	She wanted to wear something Indianny and special, so she rummaged through her wardrobes until she found some fabric she brought back from a trip to India nearly 50 years ago.        
	Will you knock something up for me that President Patil might like? she asked Angela Kelly, one of her dressmakers who obliged with the lame ball gown she wore last night.         
	The normal boy-girl sitting arrangement that is traditionally adopted for banquets had to be abandoned because the Queen had to seat the President next to herself.         
	The President, who made a speech as did the Queen, had on a deep blue sari.         
	Just before the banquet got under way in St Georges Hall, the Queen slipped down and made sure the table was beautifully laid, the best crockery (Minton, Tournai) and cutlery fetched for the occasion along with the finest decorations and the cut flowers (roses, gerbera) displayed to look fresh and resplendent.         
	In all, the table, which was one piece and very long, was set for 148. Staff got out rulers and made sure distances between guests and that between chair and table were exact. On such occasions nothing is left to chance.        
	Since the President is vegetarian, the carefully planned menu included Courgettes Farcies (stuffed courgettes), Carottes Glacees (glazed carrots), Pommes Fondantes (crispy potatoes) and salad.        
	Menus are always in French, said a palace official.         
	There was also baked aubergine and pilau rice, which appears to have been a last minute thought.         
	For the non-veg, there was Delice de Fletan aux Herbes (halibut cooked with herbs) and Selle dAgneau Pre-sale Arlesienne (lamb that is naturally salty because they have been reared near the sea).         
	The wines were choice French but for non-alcohol drinkers she served juice made with apples from her Sandringham estate.         
	Dessert was Bombe Glacee Aux Mangues (mango ice cream).         
	The mango had come from Brazil.         
	At least, they are not from Pakistan, quipped an Indian wit.         
	However, the Pakistani high commissioner, Wajed Shamsul Hassan, was invited and apparently looked less than happy when the Queen said pointedly that we are also mindful, Madam President, that in a months time, India will mark the anniversary of the appalling terrorist attacks on Mumbai, in which so many Indians were killed. I would like to pay tribute to the courage and steadfastness shown by the Indian security forces and people in the face of this great tragedy.         
	Referring to the guests, she added that nearly two million of our own citizens are tied by descent and enduring family links to India. They represent one of the United Kingdoms most dynamic and successful communities, and I am delighted to welcome many of the leaders of that community here this evening.         
	Guests included Sir Gulam Noon, who with fellow businessman Nat Puri, presented the President with a selection of letters written by Mahatma Gandhi at a moving ceremony at India House today.         
	Other guests last night included the sculptor Anish Kapoor, Harry Potter author J.K. Rowling, and Lord Meghnad Desai.         
	The President, who today met Gordon Brown, last night invited the Queen to the Commonwealth Games next October and quoted the Bard to reflect the state of Indo-British relations: As William Shakespeare said and I quote, On such a full sea are we now afloat. And we must take the current .. The time has come to look at the present and to realise the potential that the future holds for both our countries in the fullest manner possible.         
	The Queen was equally literary: Madam President, relations between our two countries are built on strong and deep foundations, and are set fair for the 21st century.

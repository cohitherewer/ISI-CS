  Punjab Cong sharpens knife          RASHEED KIDWAI                            Tytler campaigns in Seelampur, which was affected by the 1984 riots, on Wednesday. The area is in Tytlers constituency of Northeast Delhi. Jasbir Singh, a Seelampur resident, had alleged that Tytler led a mob during the riots  a statement that had forced the CBI to reopen the case. But the CBI later dismissed Jasbirs charges. Telegraph picture                                        
	New Delhi, April 8: Pressure mounted on Sonia Gandhi today to withdraw Jagdish Tytlers nomination as protests against the CBIs clean chit to him in the 1984 riots spilled on to streets and railway tracks across Punjab.        
	Congress leaders from Punjab are learnt to have informed the high command that the benefits of dumping Tytler would be far greater than winning two seats (including that of Sajjan Kumar) if the party stuck by him.        
	The situation has changed from Catch 22 to 8-2, a Congress leader said tonight, referring to the number of seats the party hoped to win in the 13-seat Punjab and lose in Delhi if Tytlers ticket was withdrawn.        
	But a section of Congress leaders lobbied for Tytler earlier in the day, insisting that legal considerations alone should decide whether he could keep the Northeast Delhi ticket.        
	A local court in Delhi is to give its view tomorrow on the CBI report that has said it found no evidence against Tytler, accused of leading mobs on November 1-2, 1984, that killed Sikhs, and sought permission to close the case against him.        
	Some Congress general secretaries, however, advocated a political line, pointing at the protests on the streets in Amritsar, Gurdaspur, Beas, Ludhiana, Patiala and Sangrur in Punjab.         
	If Sonia is to withdraw Tytler, she should take the high moral ground instead of waiting for a court opinion, they argued.        
	According to Congress convention, decisions of central election committee that grants party tickets to aspirants can be reviewed or overturned by the party president.         
	At least two members of the Congress troika  Manmohan Singh and Rahul Gandhi  are not averse to replacing Tytler, sources said. Sonia is said to be of the view that a sitting party MP deserves a patient hearing, but those in touch with her in Kerala said this evening that the tide appeared to be turning against Tytler.         
	The Congress has deputed senior leaders to gauge the popular mood in Punjab and re-assess the partys prospects in the states 13 seats, where it had appeared comfortably placed till a shoe thrown by journalist Jarnail Singh at home minister P. Chidambaram yesterday forced the 1984 riots on the poll agenda.                   Jarnail Singh      
	Sikh protesters in Punjab, led by radical groups such as the Damdami Taksal and the Dal Khalsa, squatted on railway tracks to block trains to and from Delhi. No violence was reported in the state.         
	For far too long, the perpetrators of the most heinous crime in Independent India have been walking free. This is a test case for the Congress party which prides itself on its secular credentials, said Avtar Singh Makkar, head of the Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee.        
	Over 4,000 Sikhs were massacred after Indira Gandhis assassination in 1984. But the riots were long considered a dead issue by political parties, not meriting even a discussion till the journalists action.        
	Congress leaders reluctant to act against Tytler said if he was denied a party nomination, there would be a clamour for the withdrawal of Sajjan Kumar from South Delhi. Sajjan, too, is accused of leading rioters in November 1984.        
	Tytler himself was out campaigning in his constituency at 8 this morning. He spoke of development and social issues, appearing calm, but gave away his nervousness by wringing his hands and repeating at least a dozen times that Sikhs were with him. This is sheer nonsense. The Sikhs here told me, bring Manmohan Singh back, he said. The party is supreme, Tytler added.                     WITH INPUTS FROM GAJINDER SINGH AND ANANYA SENGUPTA

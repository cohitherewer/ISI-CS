                                                                                                           BJD, Left to share seats
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                               
	Bhubaneswar, March 28: The BJD today finalised seat adjustments with CPI, CPM and NCP for the Lok Sabha and Assembly elections.        
	The three parties along with JMM had backed the BJD government, headed by Naveen Patnaik after it was reduced to minority following withdrawal of coalition partner BJP on March 7.        
	Following the break-up of the BJD-BJP alliance, CPM leader Sitaram Yechury, CPI leader A.B. Bardhan and NCP leader and Union civil aviation minister Praful Patel had held preliminary talks with Naveen for pre- poll alliance.         
	However, there were speculations that the seat adjustment might not materialise, as the talks dragged on for so many days.         
	Even the NCP announced unilaterally its candidate list without the formal consent of big brother BJD, fuelling speculation that the seat adjustment talks might fail.        
	However, Naveen today announced at a joint news conference that his party would go for seat adjustments with the two Left parties and the NCP.         
	BJD did not make seat adjustment with JMM as the latter failed to issue a public statement that it would not demand inclusion of Mayurbhanj, Sundargarh and Keonjhar districts of Orissa in its proposed Greater Jharkhand.         
	As per the seat adjustment, BJD left three out of 21 Lok Sabha seats and 17 out of 147 Assembly seats for the three friendly parties.         
	Naveen, flanked by the CPI, CPM and NCP leaders, announced that they would hold joint rallies and carry out joint campaigns.         
	The All India Forward Bloc has offered to join the joint campaigns which we heartily welcome, he said.        
	CPM was given Sundargarh Lok Sabha and four Assembly seats  Bonai, Nilgiri, Jaleswar and Khurda.         
	Similarly, CPI would contest from Jagatsinghpur Lok Sabha and five Assembly seats  Chatrapur, Sanakhemundi, Champua, Brajarajnagar and Soro. CPI and CPM had won only one seat each in the 2004 Assembly polls.        
	NCP, which had two seats in the dissolved Assembly, got a larger share. It was given Balasore Lok Sabha and eight Assembly seats  Saraskana, Rairangpur, Badchana, Narla, Talsara, Begunia, Dhenkanal and Sambalpur. Earlier, the party had announced candidates for Balasore Lok Sabha and 10 Assembly seats, including Patkura and Remuna. However, Patkura and Remuna seats were deleted from the joint list announced today.

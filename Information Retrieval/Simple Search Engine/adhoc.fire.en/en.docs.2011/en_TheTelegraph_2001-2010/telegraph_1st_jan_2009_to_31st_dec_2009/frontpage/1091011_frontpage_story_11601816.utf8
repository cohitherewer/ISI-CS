The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Brand jinx for Bengal beauties too
                                                                                                           Brand jinx for Bengal beauties too
  - Rani and Sushmita slip on endorsements but Bipasha holds sway          SAMYABRATA RAY GOSWAMI                                                      Rani and Bipasha    
	Mumbai, Oct. 10: Bollywoods Bengal babes are slipping on the brands.        
	Unrealistic financial expectations and temperamental demands seem to have pulled the red carpet from under the feet of Sushmita Sen and Rani Mukerji.        
	Rani, who has been steadily losing brands like Munch and Fanta to GenX actresses like Genelia DSouza, got a big jolt last week when Vidya Balan replaced her as the face of a mosquito repellent brand that she had been endorsing for long.        
	Top sources in the brands marketing team said though the decision came post the not-so-successful Dil Bole Hadippa, Ranis latest release, it was not the only reason behind the break-up.        
	When we started negotiating a new contract for a new product from our brand stable, Rani, despite the Hadippa failure, demanded an astronomical price  much above what she used to quote earlier. We tried negotiating and wooing her for several weeks. She had several issues and it did not work out. So we decided to move on and signed up Vidya who was much less demanding, said a source in Godrej Sara Lee, manufacturer of the Good Knight brand of mosquito repellents.        
	Vidya, incidentally, is a contemporary of Rani in terms of age. But she throws fewer tantrums and is very professional. No wonder she is shoring up endorsements from others, said the source.        
	With a career spanning 13 years with Indias top production houses, Rani was once an equal of Aishwarya Rai and Kareena Kapoor in terms of brand power.        
	Back in 2007, she was one of the highest paid women brand ambassadors in Bollywood along with Ash and Kareena, paying Rs 13 million in taxes from endorsements alone.        
	While marriage marred Ashs fortunes (she has recently made a comeback with a joint brand-endorsement deal with husband Abhishek Bachchan at a record price), Rani has been down to endorsing just two brands now from her repertoire of seven a couple of years ago.        
	The other Bengali beauty in the same boat is Sushmita, the former Miss Universe whose Bollywood career has been floundering for years now.        
	Sush, who plumped up for a role in David Dhawans recent release Do Knot Disturb opposite Govinda, has upset the brands she endorses with her diva act.        
	Apart from her lack of recent achievement, she comes with a lot of trappings and mood swings that is at times too difficult to deal with, said a source in Procter and Gamble which replaced Sush as brand ambassador for Olay.        
	As with Rani, Sush has been replaced by a contemporary, Kajol. Gul Panag and Soha Ali Khan have also been signed up as faces of the Olay brand.        
	Sushmita is a fine performer and is a lovely lady, but professionalism also matters and that is where Kajol scores big time despite not being an active Bollywood leading lady for some time now, said the P amp;G official.        
	The only girl from Bengal who has hit it big in the world of brand endorsements and continues to rule the roost is Bipasha Basu. She, along with Asin and Shilpa Shetty, recently replaced Sushmita as the face of Pantene.        
	Bips is level headed in terms of pricing and professional about her commitments. No wonder she is getting so much endorsement work, says a brand manager who has worked with all the three ladies from Bengal at some point or other.        
	Bipasha, who was roped in to promote the super-glam international shoe-brand Jimmy Choo during the opening of its first India outlet in Mumbai on Tuesday, is going from strength to strength.        
	She is also the face of Gili diamond jewellery of Geetanjali Gems. Kareena and Katrina Kaif are the two other celeb endorsers of the groups other two diamond jewellery brands.        
	Bips, who already has a clutch of top brands like Reebok, Alcome and Kinetic in her kitty, has strengthened her position with three more big contracts this year  Aristocrat, Henkels Fa Men Extreme and La Opala Diva.        
	That makes her the biggest brand-babe from Bengal.

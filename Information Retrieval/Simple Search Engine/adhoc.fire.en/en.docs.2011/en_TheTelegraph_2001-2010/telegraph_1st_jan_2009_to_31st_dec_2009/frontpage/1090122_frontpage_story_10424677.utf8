The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Dooars foray tops talks agenda 
                                                                                                           Dooars foray tops talks agenda 
          VIVEK CHHETRI                               
	Darjeeling, Jan. 21: The Gorkha Janmukti Morcha today tried to use a meeting with Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee to get a foothold in the Dooars at a time when the Adivasis have stonewalled all its efforts.         
	For the Morcha, organising public meetings in the Dooars and Terai is of utmost importance as the party believes that this is the only way to make the Adivasi community aware of the Gorkhaland demand.         
	So far the hill partys support base has largely been on ethnic lines.         
	The meeting started off on a cordial note but the chief minister turned serious when we asked for permission to hold public meetings in Dooars. We told him that we were a registered party and in a democratic country, we have every right to hold a meeting, said Amar Lama, a member of the delegation.         
	With Bhattacharjee on the backfoot, the Morcha tried to bargain for an atmosphere politically conducive to them.         
	The chief minister told us that we should wait for sometime  until the situation is normal in the Dooars  before permission to hold the meeting is given, said Lama.         
	It is then that the Morcha produced its trump card, saying the situation could not be normalised unless a section of Adivasi leaders who fomented trouble in Nagrakata on January 16 and Banarhat, a day later, was arrested.         
	We categorically told the chief minister that the names of a few leaders had cropped up in all places where there had been ethnic strife. We stressed that these leaders had to be arrested for normality to return, said Lama.         
	On Monday, the chief minister had written to Morcha president Bimal Gurung, inviting him to talks in Calcutta immediately to avert ethnic clashes.         
	At first Gurung had linked the offers acceptance to a police permission to hold rallies in the Dooars.         
	A day later, he withdrew the condition.        
	In the Morcha bad book are Rajesh Lakra, Sanjeevan Kujur, Kiran Kumar Kalanda, Sohan Lakra, Ganesh Ekka, Megnath, Ranjan Roy, Bijay Lakra, Vichar Lakra, Santosh, Ramesh Kujjur and N. Minz. Lama could not recollect the name of one more leader whom the Morcha wants to be put behind bars.         
	Bhattacharjee asked the chief secretary to note the names and said he would direct police to go through every leaders case history and report within a week, claimed Lama.         
	The Morcha believes that if these leaders are arrested, it will be able to get a foothold in the Dooars.         
	The arrest of these leaders is of much importance to the Morcha since in the past the party had been able to organise meetings in the Dooars and also take out a rally right up to Sankosh river (along the Bengal-Assam border). The resistance has only come up recently, said a Morcha leader.

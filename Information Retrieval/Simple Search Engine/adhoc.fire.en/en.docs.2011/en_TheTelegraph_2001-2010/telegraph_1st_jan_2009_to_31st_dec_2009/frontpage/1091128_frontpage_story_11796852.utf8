The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Lotteries face court wrath
                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                Lotteries face court wrath
  - Organisers ahead of law           OUR BUREAU                      Bipasha Basu with a winner of Playwin online lottery. File picture                                
	New Delhi/Calcutta, Nov. 25: The Supreme Court today asked Bengal to restrict draws of a lottery to once a week as mandated under a central act, perhaps unaware that in Calcutta you can test your luck online every five seconds and still be within the law.        
	The court issued the interim instruction on a petition filed by Bibhash Karmakar, a management graduate who frittered away whatever he had in the hope of hitting the jackpot.        
	Some states like Sikkim, which too was asked to follow the instruction, have 140 draws a week. Others have hourly online draws.         
	The Bengal government has, however, denied permitting any online lotteries in the state. The state government does not earn any revenue from any online lottery being run in the state, it said in an affidavit.         
	Karmakar had alleged that the methods of several online lotteries amounted to unethical business practices. Notices had been issued to the Union finance secretary and the secretary, social welfare ministry, other than the Bengal government.         
	In his petition, Karmakar, who runs the Mangalpur Distress Welfare Society, had said he was in deep trouble for money and started playing online lottery hoping that he could make money in this way and continue his studies by winning money online, but he lost all money on the first day.        
	Karmakar said he saw 99 per cent of the poor people who played online lottery ended up being depressed at the end of the day after losing all their hard-earned money.         
	Most of them were day labourers, rickshaw pullers, watchmen, coolies, sex workers and people from weaker classes.         
	An executive who used to work for a lottery company said: There is frenzy in front of all lottery shops.        
	In Calcutta, the executive estimated, there are about 4,000 such outlets, mostly operating out of holes in the wall. The busy among them turn over a business of Rs 10,000-15,000 a day, keeping 8 per cent for themselves.        
	These shops are franchises of lottery operators such as Playwin, Lotto, Goldwin and Rajshree. The street-level business is completely unregulated by the authorities since the licence is issued to one entity, which then authorises franchises.        
	Finance minister Asim Dasgupta said: I laud this Supreme Court verdict. This is precisely what we were waiting for. As soon as I get the order in my hand, Ill order a crackdown on the online lottery operators.        
	He might have spoken too soon because these lottery operators try to make sure they work within the law, technically. The central act of 1998 says: No lottery shall have more than one draw a week.        
	The operators organise their business thus: they hold lotteries, calling them, for example, Joker 1 at 10am, Joker 2 at 11am, Joker 3 at 12 noon, etc.  all through the day on any given day. Joker 1, or any of the others in the Joker series, held on that day would not turn up before a new week commences. Draws will, however, be made every day of the week on the hour under a differently named series each day.        
	Its not that the licence holder only makes draws. The franchises do, too, taking the frequency to a lottery every five seconds.         
	The state government had declared in 2002 that hourly online lottery amounted to gambling and that a crackdown would be launched against those indulging in such practices.        
	Raids were conducted against online hourly lottery and several machines were seized and operators arrested. Challenging the governments move, Playwin and 29 other companies moved Calcutta High Court.        
	The high court refused to stay the government order, but Playwin went to the Supreme Court in 2003. The apex court did not vacate the order passed by the high court but it restrained the state government from prosecuting the online operators or seizing their machines till the disposal of the case.         
	Since this order in 2003, there hasnt been any further hearing of the case. Since the state government, under instructions from the Supreme Court, cannot take any action against those running the online lotteries, they are carrying on with their trade, a finance department official said.

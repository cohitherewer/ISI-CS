The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Have flu? Stay off Navratri 
                                                                                                           Have flu? Stay off Navratri 
          BASANT RAWAT                              
	Ahmedabad, Sept. 17: If youve caught the flu, youre not welcome in Gujarat, at least for Navratri.         
	Call it caution or swine flu paranoia, the state government has added an advisory while inviting guests  among them world dignitaries, industrialists and corporate honchos  to Vibrant Navratri Mahotsav 2009.        
	The showpiece event of the Narendra Modi government is aimed at showcasing the state as an industrial and tourist destination to investors and travellers, both foreign and domestic.        
	But the government, it appears, is keen to keep the state in good health while inviting guests to what is billed as the biggest dance festival in the world.         
	The invite sent by the government carries an advisory, which says: In view of public interest, we would request you to avoid attending the function, in case if you have any symptoms of flu or fever. We sincerely regret inconvenience caused, if any, due to the request.         
	The government said the advisory is a precautionary measure in the state, which has registered around 20 swine flu deaths.         
	This may sound strange but this is just a precautionary step. While we want our guests and tourists to visit Gujarat to witness the biggest dance festival of the world, which showcases Gujarats cultural identity, we believe everyone should be responsible. We want them to stay away in case they have any symptoms of fever and cold, said D.K. Rao, principal secretary, tourism.        
	Given the high turnout forecast, the government doesnt want people with cough and cold to be there. Apart from our own medical teams, we have roped in two private hospitals who will be deploying their own squads at the venue, the GMDC (Gujarat Mineral Development Corporation) ground, said Rao.

          G.S. RADHAKRISHNA                                                    
	Hyderabad, Dec. 10: The Congresss midnight gift to the people of Telangana demanding a separate state today triggered a political mutiny in the rest of Andhra Pradesh with as many as 98 lawmakers, including 56 from the ruling party, submitting their resignations from the legislature.        
	The backlash prevented the statehood resolution from being tabled in the Assembly today.        
	All these MLAs are from the Rayalaseema and coastal regions, which account for 13 of the states 23 districts. Speaker Kiran Kumar Reddy said he had received the resignations but was yet to decide whether to accept them.         
	The Congress has 155 MLAs, 51 of them from Telangana, in the House of 294. The Telugu Desam, once an opponent of statehood but now a backer, has 92 MLAs, 29 of whom have given quit letters. Superstar Chiranjeevis Praja Rajyam has 18, of whom 13 have resigned. Besides, some 30 members of the legislative council and at least one MP have also submitted resignation letters.         
	All MLAs from non-Telangana regions, cutting across party lines, will boycott the Assembly session tomorrow.        
	The rebellion forced the Congress to put off tabling the statehood resolution necessary for introducing a bill in Parliament. For the resolution to be passed, the Congress will require a two-thirds majority of the House, which means the support of at least 196 MLAs. The Telangana Rashtra Samiti (TRS), the flag-bearer of the agitation, has only 10 seats.         
	The government sought to play down the resignations. The session is on till end-December. You need not hurry or worry, Speaker Reddy said. He plans to meet the MLAs individually before taking a decision. A political source said some of the resignations could have been orchestrated by the Congress to buy time after its knee-jerk reaction yesterday.        
	The mass show of defiance came hours after Union home minister P. Chidambarams announcement around midnight yesterday that the Centre was ready to initiate the process of forming a state of Telangana, which includes prized Hyderabad. The decision was aimed at persuading statehood spearhead and TRS chief K. Chandrasekhar Rao to call off his 10-day fast.        
	TRS leaders were smug from the success of their agitation. You should count your days from now on as you are on our land, party leader Etela Rajender cautioned other legislators.        
	The provocation touched a raw nerve among non-Telangana leaders. For generations, people from all regions have invested crores in developing the state, particularly Hyderabad, and now we have to get out, said a Congress MLA from Rayalaseema.         
	The struggle for Telangana has become a fight for Hyderabad, the most prosperous of the Andhra districts.         
	Industrialist T.G. Venkatesh, a Congress legislator from Kurnool, one of the Rayalaseema districts, said if Hyderabad had to be given to Telangana, the people of other regions, who have heavily invested in infrastructure, hospitality, the film industry as well as land, should get a compensation of over Rs 2 lakh crore.         
	The city, once notorious for communal riots and the land and construction mafia, was opened up for non-Telangana people during the Desam regimes of N.T. Rama Rao and Chandrababu Naidu, who said today his party would oppose bifurcation of Hyderabad.        
	Among the major non-Telangana investors in Hyderabad are GMR, which built the dazzling Rajiv Gandhi International Airport at Shamshabad, and GVK, which has several infrastructure projects lined up.        
	The Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen, which represents the city in the Lok Sabha, said Hyderabad should be turned into a Union Territory.        
	Chief minister K. Rosaiah, himself from outside Telangana, held an emergency cabinet meeting where he urged ministers to pacify the rebellious MLAs. Congress president Sonia Gandhi met disgruntled party MPs in New Delhi.

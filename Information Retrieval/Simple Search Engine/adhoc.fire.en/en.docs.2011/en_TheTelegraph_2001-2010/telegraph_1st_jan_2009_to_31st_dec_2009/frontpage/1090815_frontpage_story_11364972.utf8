          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                               
	Mumbai, Aug 14: The cellphones used by the 26/11 attackers to talk to their Pakistani handlers were made in China and bought in Pakistan, a Nokia employee today told the court that is trying the case.        
	An enforcement manager at one of Nokias US offices said through video-conferencing that the five mobiles seized by police during the attack had been made at a company unit in China and shipped to Pakistan in June 2008.        
	The woman said each mobile contained a unique International Mobile Equipment Identification (IMEI) number that is allotted to each mobile phone.        
	The witness, speaking from the Los Angeles office of US investigative agency FBI, said she did not know personally about the transaction but company records at the US office showed these phones were shipped to Nokia dealers United Mobile and Twelve Pakistan Pvt Ltd.        
	Prime accused Ajmal Kasab listened attentively and smiled when the witness mentioned Pakistan.         
	The woman was the third witness from the US who corroborated Indias claim that the attacks had been organised from Pakistani soil. Earlier, an FBI forensic expert had testified the data from the GPS used by the gunmen showed they had sailed from Karachi. A senior product specialist from Yamahas California office had deposed that a Yamaha-made motor, sold to a Lahore company, had powered the inflatable dinghy that brought the gunmen to Mumbai.

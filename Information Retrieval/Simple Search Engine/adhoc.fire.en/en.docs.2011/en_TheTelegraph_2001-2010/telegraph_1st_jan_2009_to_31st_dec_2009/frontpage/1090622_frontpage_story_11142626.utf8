	Rome, June 21: He has fought off accusations of corruption and survived a stream of verbal gaffes, but now a perfect storm of sleaze is threatening to topple the formerly unassailable Silvio Berlusconi.         
	An apparently unstoppable torrent of allegations about the procurement of high-class call girls for private parties at two of the Italian Prime Ministers luxury homes has capped two months of claim and counter-claim about his involvement with an 18-year-old underwear model.        
	Now the patience of Berlusconis supporters is being stretched to breaking point  and they have been joined by the Catholic Church in warning that the lurid allegations are gravely, perhaps fatally, damaging to his standing.        
	Avvenire, the official newspaper of the Italian Conference of Bishops, said Berlusconi must clarify his involvement in recent scandals as quickly as possible. It was time, said a strongly worded editorial, for him to come up with a believable explanation about the most urgent questions, not only those from his political rivals, but also from a section of the public who are not, in principle, opposed to him.        
	Gianfranco Fini, the parliamentary Speaker and one of the most senior figures in Berlusconis People of Freedom coalition, said there was a risk that citizens could lose faith in politics and government institutions, which are the foundations of democracy, as a result of the scandal.         
	Giuliano Ferrara, a conservative newspaper editor and a normally staunch supporter, said the Prime Minister must decide if he wanted to drown in a happy ending made up of parties and beautiful girls or restore some dignity to a great political adventure.        
	There are fears of more revelations to come in the lead up to next months G8 summit, where the billionaire media mogul will host world leaders in the mountain town of LAquila.        
	A rattled Berlusconi, 72, is struggling to contain the fall-out from claims last week that a pair of businessman brothers recruited women to attend his parties, where the flow of Champagne is matched only by the supply of young showgirls and older starlets.

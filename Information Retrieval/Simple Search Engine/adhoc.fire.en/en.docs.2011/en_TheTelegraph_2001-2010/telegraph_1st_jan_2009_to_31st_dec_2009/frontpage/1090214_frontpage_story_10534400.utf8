          SAMYABRATA RAY GOSWAMI                            Bubbly gone: Shah Rukh Khan in a Pepsi ad                                  
	Mumbai, Feb. 13: First came the bottles of kerosene, then the Pepsi whammy.         
	Friday the 13th has taken some of the fizz out of King Khan.        
	Pepsi has decided to end its decade-long relationship with Shah Rukh Khan as brand ambassador.         
	The actor, along with cricket icon Sachin Tendulkar, was among the companys most expensive celebrity endorsers.         
	The winds of change are blowing and we are looking at younger celeb faces  the mainstay of our Youngistan campaign for new India. SRK is an ageing star and does not fit the image any more. We even dropped (footballer) David Beckham from our international campaign for the same reason, said a top source in PepsiCo.        
	The superstar, who will undergo a shoulder surgery at Breach Candy hospital on Monday, confirmed he would not endorse the cola major any longer.         
	I am not a part of the campaign anymore, as of now we are not renewing the contract, Shah Rukh told PTI.        
	The severing of one of corporate Indias most visible brand relationships came on a day that began on an ominous note.        
	Around 2.30am, two unidentified attackers threw kerosene bottles at Shah Rukhs sea-facing villa Mannat at Bandra Bandstand. The duo, riding a motorcycle, escaped before the security guards could get to them.         
	The actor was away promoting his new film Billu, though wife Gauri and children Aryan and Suhana were home, sources said.        
	Police are still looking for clues on who carried out the attack, which has got Shah Rukh worried for the safety of his family.         
	They came and hurled a couple of bottles. They caught a little fire but wasnt so dangerous. Of course, it makes you feel worried about the safety of your family and children at home, PTI quoted the actor as saying.        
	As the day progressed, trade sources said Billu, produced by the superstars Red Chillies Entertainment, had registered around 30-35 per cent box-office collections on its opening day  among the lowest ever for a Shah Rukh film, though he is not billed as the main hero.         
	The film is good, but Shah Rukh looks old, said Nandini, an ardent SRK fan who makes it a point to see his new launches on the first day.         
	She could well have been echoing the Pepsi brand managers, who also feel King Khan isnt getting young any longer.         
	Officially though, Pepsi is terming this a new phase in its relationship with SRK.        
	We have a long and enduring relationship with Shah Rukh, which PepsiCo is very proud of. We are currently in discussions with him to take this relationship to a new phase, the company said in a statement.        
	Pepsis contract with Shah Rukh ended in October 2008 and was not renewed.        
	Company officials said his high fee was a deterrent.         
	It did not seem like good business. He charges Rs 4 crore per year and it was felt that we were not getting value for money. Besides it is difficult for companies to deal with celebrities of that stature, said a Pepsi source.        
	To part ways amicably, the company is planning a golden handshake in the form of a sponsorship agreement with Kolkata Knight Riders, the team owned by Shah Rukh and friends in the Indian Premier League.        
	There will be a golden handshake though. We are in talks with Kolkata Knight Riders for team sponsorship. But it will be a hard bargain, the Pepsi source said.        
	Pepsi, which is also in talks with Chennai Super Kings and Mumbai Indians for team sponsorships, plans to throw in a few goodies for the last ride together with Shah Rukh.        
	There will be sponsorship of merchandise. We are also considering a proposal to be KKRs beverage partner and serving PepsiCo beverages in home stadiums. We expect to tie up the loose ends by next week, said the Pepsi source.        
	The cola major is looking at youth icons like Mahendra Singh Dhoni, Ishant Sharma, Deepika Padukone and Katrina Kaif as their next big celeb brand ambassadors.        
	Corporate sources said Pepsis decision to drop SRK follows the industry trend of pitching for younger faces.         
	For example, Fanta, owned by Coca Cola, replaced Rani Mukherjee with Genelia DSouza and Nakshatra chose Katrina Kaif to replace Aishwarya Rai Bachchan.        
	Pepsi itself dropped ageing cricketers Rahul Dravid and Sourav Ganguly from its campaigns last year.        
	An exception to the rule is Aamir Khan. His contract with Coke has just been renewed  and apparently for a higher sum than SRK.        
	Aamir has a more ageless and inclusive appeal  he fits with Cokes brand image of optimism and age does not really play a role, said a Coke source.        
	Sources at both Pepsi and Coke also pointed out that Aamirs films have been doing better at the box-office than SRKs.         
	Aamirs Ghajini grossed almost double that of Shah Rukhs Rab Ne Bana Di Jodi. In fact Rab Ne grossed less than Akshay Kumars Singh is Kinng.        
	Billu, it seems from its lacklustre opening, might not be a very promising story either, said a source in Eros International which is distributing the film.

  - Ayodhya clocks more visitors after tabling of report          TAPAS CHAKRABORTY                      A queue in Ayodhya on Thursday. (Anurag Mishra)                                 
	Ayodhya, Dec. 5: Ankit Sharma didnt need to wade through the Liberhan commission reports more than 1,000 pages to figure out what it all meant.        
	It meant revenues  for travel operators and the Uttar Pradesh tourism department, for which Sharma works.        
	The November 24 tabling of the Liberhan report has led to a surge of tourist interest in the temple town, so much so that Ayodhya is poised to comfortably beat Agra and Varanasi this winter, tourism industry sources say.        
	During last winters peak tourist season (November to February), Ayodhya drew about 5,000 to 6,000 tourists per day, compared with 4,500 for Varanasi and 6,000 for Agra, Sharma said today, on the eve of the anniversary of the Babri Masjid demolition. This time Im hoping for better.        
	A source in the Ramjanmabhoomi Trust, which keeps records of visitors to the makeshift temple, said last years inflow was 5,000-5,500 a day whereas an average of 7,500 people had been visiting the site daily for the past six days.        
	Tour operators campaign literature reflects their eagerness to cash in on the trend.        
	The mosque was razed to the ground in the year 1992 by a group of followers who believed that it was the site of Rams birth and a mosque had been constructed here only after bringing down a temple, an online campaign by a Delhi-based tour operator says.        
	Liberhan has brought it all out. Visit the place, screams another operators campaign pamphlet.        
	Even the state tourism department tried to milk the craze  and went a bit too far in its enthusiasm. One of its publicity materials showed the Babri Masjid site as Ramjanmabhoomi last week, kicking up a row since the question whether the site was indeed Rams birthplace is in court.        
	A red-faced government has asked the regional tourism officer to explain the faux paus. This inadvertent error in a small guide booklet on Ayodhya has caused us unnecessary embarrassment; so we are withdrawing it immediately, state tourism director-general Avanish Kumar Awasthi said.        
	Azmadullah, a shopkeeper here who lost his brother and nephew in the 1992 riots, looks back in anguish at those events but admits that the days surrounding the demolition anniversary are good for business since the occasion coincides with the peak tourist season.        
	This time the rush is more. Liberhan has resurrected interest in the Ayodhya incidents of 1992, he said.        
	Khalid Mohammad Aslam, a trader, said the rush of tourists causes no trouble  both the visitors and townsfolk ignore the political rhetoric on anniversary day and go about their business.        
	The administration has assured the travel industry that despite the heavy security and the high alert sounded for tomorrow, tourist inflow wouldnt be hampered, said tour operator Viswanath Rai.        
	We expect at least 7,000 tourists the whole week beginning tomorrow, said Faizabad senior superintendent of police R.P.S. Rathore, adding that the makeshift temple draws between 500 to 1,500 pilgrims daily round the year.        
	Ayodhya, however, draws fewer foreign tourists than Varanasi or Agra. The visitors are mostly from southern and western India, and are predominantly Hindus.        
	They pay a quick visit to the Hanuman Garhi temple and then spend most of their time at the makeshift temple, often asking questions about the aborted terror attack in July 2005 when six militants were killed.        
	Many of the visitors also make it to the Vishwa Hindu Parishad workshop 2km away where stone blocks and pillars were cut and chiselled for the construction of a grand Ram temple at the demolition site.        
	The work stopped as the chances of building the temple got bleaker, but the sculptured pink Dholpur stones, pillars and motifs have been a tourist attraction, said workshop manager Annubhai Sonepura.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Bypoll blow to Nitish halo
                                                                                                           Bypoll blow to Nitish halo
  - Fighting Opposition, rebels in ranks led to drubbing        NALIN VERMA                                    
	Patna, Sept. 17: Nitish Kumar has suffered the first major electoral setback during his four-year tenure as the Bihar chief minister, with his NDA trailing the RJD-LJP combine in what had been christened the semi-final ahead of the state Assembly elections next year.         
	Lalu Prasad-Ram Vilas Paswan-led RJD-LJP combination, which virtually suffered a rout in the Lok Sabha polls only over three months ago, turned the table in this bypoll, winning nine seats against NDAs six. The Congress, too, has got a clear signal of its revival by winning two seats  equal to the BJP tally.         
	The RJD emerged as the largest single party with five seats against JD(U)s four, BJPs two, LJPs three and Congresss two. The BSP, too, has won the lone Natuan seat.         
	What appears to have worked against Nitish Kumar, who fashioned the NDAs grand victory in the last Lok Sabha polls and who had never suffered defeat in any of the bypolls after becoming the chief minister, was his fight on two fronts  first, against the Opposition and, second, against the rebels in his ranks.         
	It was for the first time that Nitish faced strong opposition from many of his MPs and MLAs for denying tickets to their wards. These MPs and MLAs apparently ganged up against the chief minister.        
	Nitish also constituted the D. Bandopadhyay Commission, which recommended the right to share-croppers on the pattern of bargadari system in Bengal.         
	Bandopadhyays recommendations gave the impression that the Bihar chief minister was going to implement the share-croppers right, antagonising the upper castes who had strongly backed his combination in the last Lok Sabha polls.         
	Moreover, his decision to field renegades from Lalu Prasads RJD, too, appears to have boomeranged. Soon after the RJDs rout, Shyam Razak, the right hand of Lalu Prasad, deserted the party to join the JD(U), which fielded him from the Phulwari Sharief seat.         
	Although Nitish made the seat his prestige issue, Razak suffered a defeat in the hands of RJDs Udai Majhi, who ironically had crossed over to the RJD from the JD(U).        
	Similarly, Ramai Ram who had won the Bochacha seat five times as the RJD nominee in the past had crossed over to the JD(U). But he, too, suffered defeat at Bochacha at the hands of his RJD rival who too had crossed over to the RJD from the JD(U).         
	Soon after suffering the biggest defeat in the last Lok Sabha polls, Lalu Prasad had announced that he would stay in Bihar and fan out in its remotest corner to find out from the voters why had they deserted him. True to his words, the RJD boss reached the remotest corner and cajoled the voters, which seems to have paid off for the RJD-LJP combination.         
	An embattled Lalu who, so far, was maintaining a low profile is back with a roar. The people have exposed Nitishs so-called susashan (good governance). The result is the manifestation of strong resentment gripping the denizens against Nitishs policy of dividing the society on caste lines. The LJP-RJD combination had got the support of all sections of the society, Lalu Prasad said.         
	The result is also demoralising for the NDA in view of the fact that it had 14 of the 18 seats in the possession against four of the RJD-LJP combine. The NDA has been reduced to six seats, losing eight to the RJD-LJP, Congress and others.         
	The Congress is a big gainer in the sense that it had none of the seats in its possession.

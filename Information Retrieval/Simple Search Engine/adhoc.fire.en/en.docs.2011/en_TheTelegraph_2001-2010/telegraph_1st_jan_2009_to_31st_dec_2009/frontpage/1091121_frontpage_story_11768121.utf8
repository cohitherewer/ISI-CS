          SAMBIT SAHA                              
	Calcutta, Nov. 20: Indonesian Salim Group associate Prasoon Mukherjee today met a senior government official, triggering speculation about progress on the proposed Nayachar chemical hub.        
	Official sources said the Bengal government had already signed a lease agreement to hand over Nayachar to the Salim-led consortium. But this could not be confirmed with either industries minister Nirupam Sen or Nandini Chakraborty, executive director of the West Bengal Industrial Development Corporation, which is partnering New Kolkata International Development (NKID) in the project.        
	NKID is a 50:50 joint venture between Salim and Mukherjee. The private sector partner would not speak.         
	The sources revealed that the deal to transfer over 13,000 acres to PCR Chemicals Pvt Ltd, a joint venture between the West Bengal Industrial Development Corporation and NKID, took place earlier this month but had been kept under wraps.        
	Some supplementary agreements were signed today when Mukherjee met chief secretary Asok Mohan Chakrabarti, empowering PCR Chemicals to start development work on the island.        
	PCR Chemicals will pay Rs 22,500 per acre as rental on a lease that will be valid for 99 years, the sources said.        
	The state government last month signed a memorandum of understanding with the Centre to build a petroleum, chemical, petrochemical investment region, popularly known as a chemical hub.        
	Mamata Banerjee, who spearheaded the agitation in Nandigram where the project was originally supposed to come up, has opposed the shift to Nayachar for environmental reasons. Nisith Adhikary, the local Trinamul strongman who is now a Union minister, wants to develop the river island for tourism.        
	The project awaits environmental clearance from the Centre where Mamata could create pressure if she so wished.

          RAJ KUMAR AND SHAHNAWAZ AKHTAR                              
	Ranchi/Giridih, June 16: Naxalites ambushed and killed four men in khaki in a Palamau village sandwiched between Bihar and Jharkhand today, continuing to torment security forces who have already lost as many as 21 men in rebel attacks in the last seven days.        
	At least six policemen were injured in the three-hour encounter that began at 12 noon at Baheratand village under the Manatu police station area where a team of constables  of No. 2 Battalion of the Jharkhand Armed Police (JAP)  and district police was on long-range patrolling in the hilly forests bordering Chatra and Bihars Gaya districts.         
	The only consolation for the state, reeling from Maoists attacks since the last week, came from Giridih today when the police announced the arrest of a woman rebel involved in last weeks blasts in Bokaro.        
	A group of around 40 Naxalites had taken positions in the hilly terrain soon after coming to know about the teams patrol in their den, a police officer said about todays encounter.         
	No sooner had the policemen come within their firing range than they started indiscriminate firing, he added.        
	The slain policemen included Manatu police station havildar Vidyanand Singh, constables Prakash Choudhary and Chandan Singh, and JAP constable No. 117 Uttam Kumar.        
	Of the six injured, five belonged to the district police, while the other was a JAP jawan. The jawan, Manmasi Sanga, was airlifted in an army chopper to Apollo Hospital in Ranchi, while the rest were admitted to Palamau Sadar hospital.         
	Palamau superintendent of police Mohit Bundas, who joined office today, was not available for comment.         
	But, state police spokesperson S.N. Pradhan claimed a few Naxalites had also been killed in the incident. Our jawans must have killed five Naxalites but they could not recover the bodies, he added.        
	In Giridih, Ritika Di alias Juli (22), a member of the CPI(Maoist) guerrilla squad, was picked up by the police on Sunday from a clinic at Lakhosia in Bagoder where she had come for treatment along with one Manju Kumari (14).        
	Ritika works with dreaded Naxalite leaders Navin Manjhi and Praveel. The Bokaro police informed us that she had led the June 12 attack at Phusro. She is also an active member of the Nari Mukti Sangh, said Bagoder police station officer-in-charge Satish Kumar.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Do it now, says court 
                                                                                                           Do it now, says court     Bus phase-out rolls
          OUR BUREAU                                                     
	Calcutta, July 24: The Bengal government was today left with no option but to do it now with the high court declining to extend the deadline for phasing out commercial vehicles of 15 years of age and above.        
	Transport operators called off their indefinite strike after a days shutdown following the blow but said they would move the Supreme Court for an extension.        
	Subhas Chakraborty, whose transport ministry has dragged its feet for months, now has seven days to put in place the plan to purge city roads of polluting commercial vehicles.         
	Over 2,500 buses, 550 minibuses and 6,500 taxis will have to be pulled off the roads under an earlier high court ruling that said commercial vehicles that are 15 years old and above would not be allowed to operate beyond July 31.         
	We are moving the Supreme Court for a favourable order early next week, said Swarnakamal Saha, the general secretary of the Bengal Bus Syndicate and spokesman for the Banijyik Paribahan Bachao Committee, the umbrella body of transport operators.         
	The entire fleet of over 15,000 private buses and minibuses  and 42,000-odd taxis that had gone on a days token strike  was off the roads as the operators tried to armtwist the government into backing their demand for a deadline extension. The strike did partially affect life, but the Metro and the orphaned tramcars kept the city moving.        
	The Bengal Bus Syndicate moved the high court for an early hearing of the case on phasing out 15-year-old vehicles with green activist Subhash Dutta supporting their argument that the move would inconvenience commuters.                   
	We are fully aware of the situation. But we will not hear the case now. The case will be heard on August 21, the division bench of Chief Justice S.S. Nijjar and Justice B. Sommadder said.        
	We have passed the order for the sake of the general public, and the state government will have to decide how it would implement the order, the bench said.         
	Chakraborty claimed the government would not allow any polluting vehicle to ply, adding that it was ready with a plan to tackle the fallout from the withdrawals.         
	Arrangements for getting 2,900 buses are being made so that all of them are on the roads in the next three months in a phased manner. The state governments fleet of around 2,000 buses will be there too, Chakraborty said.        
	Although nearly 10,000 of the 80,000 auto-rickshaws will stop plying from August 1, the transport department is not worried.         
	Autos are local transport. So the inconvenience caused by their absence will be far less, said an official.         
	The Bengal government has urged Union urban development minister Jaipal Reddy to sanction a fleet of 1,000 buses under the Jawaharlal Nehru National Urban Renewal Mission.         
	Besides, the transport department is expecting the delivery of 700 low-floor buses  400 by the third week of August and 300 before the pujas  from the Centre.         
	A transport department source said the list of vehicles to be phased out had been sent to the police, the public vehicles department and the regional transport authorities in North and South 24-Parganas and Howrah.         
	The officials will crack down on these vehicles from August 1, he said.

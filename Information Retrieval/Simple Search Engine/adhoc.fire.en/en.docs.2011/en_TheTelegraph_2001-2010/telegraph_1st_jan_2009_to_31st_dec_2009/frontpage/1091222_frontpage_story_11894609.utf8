The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | In the name of the son, Koda
                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                In the name of the son, Koda
          JAYESH THAKER                                        Rasika Koda (top), father of former chief minister Madhu Koda, is banking on his bahu Geeta to save his son from political oblivion. File pictures                                  
	Jamshedpur, Dec. 21: Rasika Koda believes the only person who can resurrect his sons political future is his daughter-in-law, Geeta.        
	Having articulated his dislike for politics in no uncertain terms ever since former chief minister and Singhbhum MP Madhu Koda was jailed facing serious corruption charges, the 62-year-old farmer father has now thrown his weight behind his ghar ka bahu to turn things around for his son who, he believes, has become a victim of political conspiracy.        
	Geeta ka rajniti mein aana shuru mein pasand nahin tha. Par ab ussey hi sab kuch karna hain. Beta abhi hamare beech nahih hain. Mujhe to apni bahu par atoot viswas hain (I was opposed to Geeta joining politics initially. But now she has to do everything. My son is now not within us. I have high hopes in my daughter in-laws abilities), Rasika said.        
	A far cry from the early days when he publicly admonished his son for having joined politics, Rasikas utterances indicate a new-found confidence, defiance even, at facing the challenges ahead.        
	Having given up his daily routine of tilling the fields and feeding ducks, Rasika has now turned Geetas poll manager. A regular at the Jagannathpur office of Jai Bharat Samanta Partys (JBSP)  the political party floated by his son  he is helping out by organising stationery and clearing payments to cars that had been hired.        
	Madhu Koda, who campaigned extensively in the Chaibasa area for his wife Geeta and six other candidates of his new party, is back in jail to be interrogated by the state vigilance in connection with corruption and money laundering cases allegedly worth more than Rs 2,000 crore.        
	Claiming that there was no bigger leader than his son in Singhbhum, Rasika said he was doubtful about his sons early release from jail. Kya jaane kab bahar aayega. Der bhi ho sakta hain. Uska adhura kaam Geeta hi pura kar sakti hain (I dont know when hell come out of jail. Only Geeta can complete his unfinished work), he said chewing tobacco.        
	Rasika is relishing his new role though. Yeh sab to mujhe karna padega. Geeta to chunav lad rahi hain. Mujhe baaki sab kuch dekhna hain (I have to do all these things. Geeta is figting elections. I have to look after the rest), he said.

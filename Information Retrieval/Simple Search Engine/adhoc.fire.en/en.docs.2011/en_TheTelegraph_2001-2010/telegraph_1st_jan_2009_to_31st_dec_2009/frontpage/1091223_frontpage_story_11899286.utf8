  - Court asks GM to take back vehicle, clears payment           SAMANWAYA RAUTRAY                            A Chevrolet Forester                                        
	New Delhi, Dec. 22: The Supreme Court has told General Motors India to take back from a dissatisfied customer, against a refund, a vehicle that was launched in the country in 2003 but withdrawn after a few years.        
	The customer had alleged the companys ad line comparing the Chevrolet Forester to a mountain goat was misleading, and that it was an ordinary passenger car and not a sports utility vehicle with all-terrain capability as claimed in company brochures.        
	In an interim order on November 20 this year, a two-judge bench directed Ahmedabad-based businessman Ashok Ramniklal Tolat, 80, to return the vehicle to General Motors (GM) within four weeks. Once he returned the vehicle, he would be entitled to withdraw Rs 12.5 lakh and another Rs 50,000 (litigation costs) that the company had deposited with the Ahmedabad district consumer forum under court instructions.        
	The court said GM could sell the vehicle and keep the proceeds in a separate account till the final verdict was delivered.         
	The only matter left to be decided is whether GM should have to pay Rs 25 lakh to the Central Consumer Welfare Fund.        
	Tolat claimed he had bought the vehicle in 2004 for Rs 14 lakh and spent another Rs 2 lakh to do it up. But just a year later, after heavy showers, the vehicle, parked in front of his house, refused to start.                          
	After two such incidents  which he claimed had forced him to spend substantial amounts on repairs  he approached the Ahmedabad district consumer forum alleging unfair trade practices.        
	There, he argued that although the original brochure shown to him had claimed the vehicle was an SUV with all-terrain capability, the manual issued to him as its owner said it was a passenger car with limited off-road capabilities. He accused the company of misleading him.         
	The forum upheld his case, asking GM to pay Tolat the full value of the vehicle (Rs 14 lakh), another Rs 5,000 for the mental agony he had undergone, Rs 2,000 towards litigation costs and a nine per cent interest on the total from the day the case was filed till the verdict.        
	GM appealed to the state consumer disputes redressal forum, which too held in Tolats favour. It, however, directed the company to only pay him Rs 50,000 as compensation.        
	Tolat then approached the Delhi-based National Consumer Disputes Redressal Forum, which asked the company to pay him the depreciated value of the vehicle  Rs 12.5 lakh  and another Rs 50,000 as legal costs.        
	The commission also asked GM to pay Rs 25 lakh to the welfare fund, which arranges lawyers for poor litigants and helps spread consumer awareness. Tolat had demanded Rs 10 crore for the fund. GM then appealed in the Supreme Court.

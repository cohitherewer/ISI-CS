The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | 15-yr-old dials party chief 
                                                                                                           15-yr-old dials party chief 
          AVIJIT SINHA                              
	Siliguri, Jan. 2: Fifteen-year-old Prithika Pradhan lay sleepless in bed last night. While her home had been ransacked, the small eatery the family ran had been torched by the mob which had got insane after Subodh Pradhan was lynched in the nearby DGHC guest house the night before.        
	By morning, Prithika had made up her mind: she would somehow call up Morcha leaders Bimal Gurung and Roshan Giri and ask them how they could allow their partymen to indulge in such mindless violence.         
	I had to have an answer to the mindless violence indulged in by a party that believes in the ideals of Mahatma Gandhi, Prithika told The Telegraph this afternoon.         
	Since her father, a CISF employee, was away on a posting, the Class XI student of Kendriya Vidyalaya, Sukna, got in touch with friends and relatives and finally managed to get the cellphone numbers of the two Morcha leaders.        
	At 11am, a slightly nervous Prithika dialled Morcha chief Bimal Gurung. The number was busy. She waited a few minutes, and dialled again, but it was busy once more. She then decided to call up Roshan Giri, the general secretary of the party.        
	Luckily for her, she got through to Giri on the first try. He was on the train, returning from Delhi after the tripartite talks.         
	I introduced myself and narrated the ordeal that the people of Rohini had gone through, Prithika said. He listened to me patiently and told me not to live in fear any longer. He said he would come with his team and listen to us and sort out everything.        
	With that assurance, Giri ended the call and Prithika decided she would try Gurungs number once again. This time she got through and recognised his voice instantly. Although he did not utter a word on why his partymen had behaved in the manner that they had, I was happy that he was concerned about our losses and promised help.         
	Giri confirmed that Prithika had called him up. Gurung could not be contacted as his phones were switched off.

	Bokaro/Dhanbad, Feb. 21: A crack police team today nabbed a group of six sharpshooters from Bihar, moments after they alighted from a train in Bokaro, and claimed to have busted a mafia plot to eliminate senior doctors, businessmen and other prominent steel city residents for resisting extortion attempts.        
	The Bokaro and Dhanbad police team, who had been intercepting calls coming in at the behest of dreaded Bihar don Bindu Singh, managed to arrest the six  two of them computer engineers from Patna  soon after they got off the Patna-Hatia Express at 4am in Bokaro.        
	A number of revolvers, cartridges and mobile phones were seized from them.        
	According to DIG coal belt Anurag Gupta, the group was on a mission to kill at least two doctors of Dhanbad and Sindri, and several prominent businessmen of Dhanbad and Bokaro as revenge for lodging complaints in various police stations about extortion calls demanding money ranging from Rs 2 lakh to Rs 10 lakh.         
	Those arrested have been identified as Jai Prakash Singh (Bhadohi-UP), Atul Kumar (Gaya), Vijay Kumar, alias Sanju (Patna), Manoj Singh (Buxar), Manish Raj (Rohtas) and Mohammad Mehran (Gaya). Among them, Manish and Vijay were computer engineers pursuing their MCA in Patna.        
	DIG Gupta told The Telegraph it was a prized catch for the police. The arrest was planned meticulously after tapping phone calls that were being made by the Bihar mafia. Bindu Singh and his men will now have to pay a heavy price for the crimes they have committed, he said.        
	The coal belt police have been on the case for quite sometime now. The initial breakthrough came early this month when 11 youths were arrested in Bokaro and Dhanbad.

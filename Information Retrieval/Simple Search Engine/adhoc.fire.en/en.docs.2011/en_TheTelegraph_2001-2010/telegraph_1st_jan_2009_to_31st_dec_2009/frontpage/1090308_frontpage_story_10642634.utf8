Orissa ally parts ways with BJP after seat-share talks flop          SANJAY K. JHA AND SUBRAT DAS                      In happier times: LK Advani and Naveen Patnaik (Fourth and Fifth from left) at a rally in Rourkela in June 2008				                                             
	New Delhi/ Bhubaneswar, March 7: The Biju Janata Dal today delivered a staggering blow to L.K. Advanis prime ministerial ambitions by walking out of the BJP-led National Democratic Alliance.         
	Unfortunately, the seat-sharing talks between the BJD and the BJP have failed. Therefore, we will go to the polls separately, Orissa chief minister and BJD chief Naveen Patnaik said tonight, waving away the BJPs requests to allow it time to hold one more meeting to save the 11-year alliance.        
	The BJD, which with 11 Lok Sabha seats was the third biggest party in the NDA after the BJP and the Shiv Sena, was one of the BJPs oldest allies.         
	Although attacks on Christians in Kandhamal allegedly by Sangh parivar supporters, which brought a bad name to the Patnaik government, strained relations and there was disagreement over the BJDs demand for a bigger share of seats, the BJP was till late this evening sure of keeping the alliance.         
	Top sources in the stunned BJP told The Telegraph the seat-sharing dispute was a charade and that Patnaik had made up his mind to end the alliance.         
	He was not willing to negotiate and confronted our mediator Chandan Mitra with a fait accompli this evening, a BJP leader said, dismissing the suggestion the party was not ready to accommodate its partners call for more seats.         
	The BJD had asked for at least 100 of the 147 Assembly seats, a demand the BJP was willing to consider, the sources said. However, the BJP wanted two more Lok Sabha seats.        
	In the last elections, the BJD had fought 12 of the 21 Lok Sabha seats, leaving nine to the BJP. It contested 84 of the Assembly seats, with the BJP fighting from 63.        
	However, after the BJD swept the civic polls in Bhubaneswar late last year and Cuttack in January, there was a clamour in the party for more seats.        
	The BJP had tonight decided not to announce the collapse of the talks immediately and pleaded with Patnaik to give it some time to hold a meeting of top leaders in Delhi tomorrow. But Patnaik went directly to the media.         
	The formula proposed by the BJP is unacceptable to us, he said, minutes after his meeting with Mitra, Advanis special emissary, ended.        
	Later, the BJP met the governor and withdrew support to the Patnaik government. It demanded Presidents rule a month ahead of polls. The coalition, whose second term in power is drawing to a close, had in the year 2000 given the BJP its toehold in eastern India.         
	Sources said Mitra yesterday conveyed to Patnaik the BJP was willing to offer more Assembly seats to the BJD and presented him with a survey report that painted a grim picture for both parties if they split. The report suggested the Congress, which now has only 2 Lok Sabha seats as compared to the BJDs 11 and the BJPs seven, would sweep the polls in case of a triangular fight.         
	The impression the BJP got was that Patnaik had seen reason. But when Mitra met him again, Patnaik bluntly told him the alliance was not working and we have to go separately.         
	Not only is the split a blow to the BJP in terms of the seats it can hope to win, but also because it weakens the partys position in talks with allies such as the Janata Dal (U) and the Shiv Sena that have been driving a hard bargain.         
	The break-up, which Mitra described as very unfortunate, would be all the more painful for the BJP because Patnaik had carved the BJD out of the Janata Dal in 1997 only to align with it. He faced overwhelming criticism and was accused of maligning his father Biju Patnaiks secular legacy. While the Shiv Sena and the Akali Dal were seen as natural allies of the BJP, Patnaiks support provided much-needed legitimacy to the party that was treated as an untouchable by secular groups.        
	But the Sangh parivars aggressive campaign against Christians and the Kandhamal violence strained ties.        
	The CPM sensed the discomfort and also the growing feeling in the BJD that the BJP getting a disproportionate share of seats. Bengal chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee and politburo member Brinda Karat were, therefore, working on Patnaik to join a non-Congress, non-BJP alternative. The CPMs central committee meeting in Kochi in January also discussed the prospect of the BJD leaving the BJP.        
	The BJD cannot support the Congress, which is the main Opposition party in the state. Once they are out of the BJP fold, they would be joining the non-BJP, non-Congress alternative, a CPM source today said, adding: Like his father Biju Patnaik, Naveen Patnaik is very secular.

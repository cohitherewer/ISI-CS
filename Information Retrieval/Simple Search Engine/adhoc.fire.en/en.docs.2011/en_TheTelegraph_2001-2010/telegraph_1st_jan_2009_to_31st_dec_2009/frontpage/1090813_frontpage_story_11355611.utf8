                                                                                                           AASU fast on I-Day eve over flop accord
          A STAFF REPORTER                                     
	Guwahati, Aug. 12: The All Assam Students Union (AASU) will sit on a hungerstrike here on Independence Day to protest against non-implementation of the key causes of the Assam Accord, 24 ye-ars after the pact was signed.         
	AASU adviser Samujjal Bhattacharyya said it was 24 years since the Assam Accord was signed but till date, some of its key clauses are yet to be implemented because of which illegal migration from Bangladesh to Assam was still continuing.         
	We will go on a hungerstrike from 6am on August 14 till the official Independence Day flag-hoisting to express our anguish over the non-implementation of the accord.         
	The Assam Accord was signed on August 15, 1985 between the Centre and representatives of AASU and the All Assam Gana Sangram Parishad, which had spearheaded the movement against foreigners, in the presence of then Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi to settle the foreigners issue.         
	The accord brought an end to the six-year Assam Agitation and paved the way for the leaders of the agitation to form the government under the leadership of Prafulla Kumar Mahanta.         
	But unfortunately, all successive state governments, including the two Asom Gana Parishad (AGP) governments led by Mahanta, and the Union governments have failed to implement the accord, which shows their lack of concern for the burning problem, Bhattacharyya said.         
	AASU president Shankar Prasad Ray said the central committee members of the students union would sit on the hunger strike.         
	The union leaders also asked both Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and chief minister Tarun Gogoi to make their views on the implementation of the accord public during their Independence Day speeches.         
	Questioning the commitment of both the state and Union governments on implementation of the accord, Bhattacharyya asked: If the Indo-Pakistan border could be fenced in just three years, then why could the Indo-Bangladesh border not be sealed in 24 years?         
	At the tripartite meeting on implementation of Assam Accord held on May 5, 2005, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh said the Bangladesh border would be sealed by December 31, 2006. But unfortunately the fencing is yet to be completed.         
	He said the porous border with Bangladesh had not only changed the demographic pattern of the state but also become a threat to the integrity and sovereignty of the country as fundamentalist elements were also sneaking in.

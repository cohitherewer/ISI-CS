          SANTSOH K. KIRO                            The family of farmer Mahavir Yadav (not in picture) who rues the inaction of the state that has left their village, Chautha, without proper irrigation facilties for decades. Telegraph picture                                         
	Chautha (Vishnugarh), Dec. 5: About 100km away from the state capital, Chautha is living with the nightmare of over 50 HIV deaths in the last decade.        
	Now that elections are on, their only wish from the next government is to provide their sons and daughters employment opportunities so that they do not have to migrate to other cities in search of a livelihood and risk contracting the virus.        
	HIV/AIDS is a big problem in our village. Frustrated with prolonged unemployment, several youths migrate to Mumbai and Delhi to work as taxi drivers. They come back after contracting the virus, explained Santosh Yadav, one of the few from Chautha who is a management graduate, that too from Jamnalal Bajaj Institute of Management Studies, Mumbai.         
	But he goes out of his way to explain that not many are as fortunate as him, referring to a family business in the state capital and elsewhere.        
	Chautha, under Bagodar Assembly constituency in Vishnugarh block in Hazaribagh district, has about 800 families with well over 200 young graduates. But barring a few who got government jobs a few years ago, no one else has landed any kind of employment recently.        
	Have they been able to talk about their problem to the candidates, including sitting MLA, Vinod Singh, of the CPI(ML)?        
	No. For, one has has had the time to campaign there as yet.         
	When confronted, RJD nominee Gautam Sagar Rana said he had plans to visit the village soon. It is a various serious problem which can only be solved by giving jobs to local youths and stopping them from migrating, he added.        
	But Vinod Singh, son of former Bagoder MLA Mahendra Singh, claimed it was he who took the initiative  since there was no help forthcoming from the state  to record all HIV positive cases in the region. I have also forced the district administration to ensure relief for the widows by way of allotting Antodaya cards which entitle them to special food-based assistance, he claimed.         
	Yet, he agreed it was a serious problem. There are numerous widows throughout Vishnugarh in Hazaribagh who are afflicted by AIDS. These helpless women have been left by the state to fend for themselves, despite numerous demands for setting up a testing centre.        
	Ironically, the village has only one sub-public health centre with absolutely no facilities or expertise to treat AIDS patients. And when things get bad, patients go to Hazaribagh to a treatment centre run by an NGO.        
	Chautha has other concerns too. Rice and wheat supply through PDS is irregular at best. Residents, mostly farmers, could do with better irrigation facilities as all they have are a few wells that they had themselves dug up.         
	There is a canal that cuts through the village, but it has remained dry for the last 25 years as it hasnt been linked to a dam.        
	The Jamunia rivulet flows though Chautha, which is surrounded by thick forests that have now become Maoists dens, though the rebels have so far stayed away from the village. If the government constructs small check dams on the rivulet, we can irrigate our fields. We can grow vegetables and improve our lot, said Mahavir Yadav, a farmer.         
	There are two railway stations, Hazaribagh Road and Parasnath, nearby. And each day more than 20 young men of the area, including Vishnugarh and Bagodar blocks, board trains in search of a better life in Mumbai or Delhi.         
	On many days, an equal number of youths get off here, comng back home after realising they are sick and cant work anymore. If the next government fails to address the unemployment issue, we will have no option but to leave our homes for good, said Mantu Yadav, a third-year BA student of Ghaghra Science College, Bagodar.        
	Is anyone listening?

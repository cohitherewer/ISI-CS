  - Tragedy strikes at seasons start         OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                                    
	New Delhi, Aug. 8: Prime Minister Manmohan Singh today sought to prepare the country for a rise in prices of essential commodities but said no citizen should go hungry because of the erratic monsoon.        
	In no case should we allow citizens to go hungry, the Prime Minister told a meeting of state chief secretaries to take stock of the drought-like conditions in parts of the country.        
	We need to be aware of the possibility that reduced production of kharif crops in the current year may have an inflationary impact on prices of food items in the coming months, he said, pointing out that 141 of the countrys 593 districts are facing drought.        
	But he held out an assurance that at 52.5 million tonnes, the country had sufficient food grain reserves. The shortfall in food grain output during the current crop year (July 2009 to July 2010) is expected to be about 20-25 million tonnes.        
	Singh threatened strong action against hoarders and black marketers.        
	States were asked to use central funds to restore water bodies, dig and deepen wells and ensure supply of drinking water. Officials said the rural job scheme would be used to help affected farmers.

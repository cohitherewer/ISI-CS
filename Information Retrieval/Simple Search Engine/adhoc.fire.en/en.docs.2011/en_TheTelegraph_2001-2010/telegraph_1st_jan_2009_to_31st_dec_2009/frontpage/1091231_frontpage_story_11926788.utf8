	Ranchi, Dec. 30: Eleven months after having to quit as chief minister following a byelection debacle, JMM chief Shibu Soren got back the coveted post today, riding on a fractured mandate, but holding out a New Year promise of providing Jharkhand with a popular government to be run by an opportunistic coalition cobbled together with the BJP and Ajsus help.        
	Ending 11 months of Presidents rule, Governor K. Sankaranarayanan presided over a grand function at the historic Morabadi grounds where he administered the oath of office to Soren at 10.30am as the seventh chief minister of the state along with the BJPs state party chief Raghubar Das and the All Jharkhand Students Union chief Sudesh Mahto.         
	Das and Mahto would be deputy chief ministers, posts created to accommodate the leaders who have provided the JMM with bulk of the numbers needed to form a government. In the 81-member Assembly, Sorens coalition now has the support of 44 MLAs  in addition to the 18 of the JMM, the BJP has 18, the Ajsu 5, the JD(U) 2 and the Jharkhand Janadhikar Manch one (Bandhu Tirkey).        
	Soon after taking oath, Soren held a cabinet meeting where it was decided to convene the House from January 4 to January 8, the deadline set by the governor for him to prove his majority.        
	The cabinet chose JMM MLA Teklal Mahto as protem Speaker, who will administer the oath to the new MLAs on January 4. The Speaker will be elected on January 6. The governor will address the House on January 7 followed by Soren seeking a vote of confidence. The House will debate the vote of thanks on the governors speech on the final day.         
	Das was later given the portfolio of parliamentary affairs, keeping in mind the House session that will be convened next week. After the January 7 trust vote, Soren would expand his Cabinet, expected to be a tricky affair given the high number of claimants.        
	All coalition partners used todays swearing-in ceremony to show off their might, flooding the venue with over 10,000 supporters, who had braved the morning chill, party flags and placards.         
	If the BJP top brass was conspicuous by its absence, the party was represented by two chief ministers, Raman Singh of Chhattisgarh and Ramesh Pokhriyal Nisak of Uttarakhand, Bihar deputy chief minister Sushil Kumar Modi and MPs Yashwant Sinha and Arjun Munda, also a former chief minister.        
	The JD(U) was represented by its two MLAs, state party chief Jaleshwar Mahto and Raja Peter.        
	Among the others present were JVM chief  and another former chief minister  Babulal Marandi, but there was no one from his ally, the Congress. The RJD was represented by its MLA, Annapurna Devi.        
	Das attributed the absence of his partys central leaders to a two-day meeting of various state units that BJP president Nitin Gadkari had scheduled for December 30-31.        
	Jharkhand has been under presidents rule since January 19 as no one was ready to form a government after Soren had to resign as chief minister upon losing the Tamar bylection to Peter, who is now one of the two JD(U) MLAs supporting his government. Soren will have to cross that hurdle once again now to remain in the saddle after June 2010. Soon, a search will have to be mounted for a safe seat, and a willing MLA ready to part with it, for the sake of Guruji.

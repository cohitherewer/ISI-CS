                                                                                                           CM talks plea after clashes
          OUR BUREAU                      The first company of CRPF that arrived at New Jalpaiguri. (Kundan Yolmo)                          
	Jan. 19: The chief minister wrote to Gorkha Janmukti Morcha president Bimal Gu-rung today, inviting him to talks in Calcutta immediately to avert ethnic clashes in north Bengal.         
	In Darjeeling, Gurung linked the offer to a police permission to hold rallies in the Dooars. We will go to Calcutta to meet the chief minister only after the state government assures us that wed be allowed to hold our scheduled meetings in the Dooars and ensures the safety and security of our supporters. Before that, we are not in a position to take a decision (on the talks).        
	Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee wanted to talk to Gurung immediately, home secretary Ardhendu Sen said at Writers Buildings. We want talks with you (Gurung) to avert ethnic clashes in Jalpaiguri and other parts of north Bengal, Sen said, quoting from the letter but he ruled out letting Morcha supporters assemble at Nagrakata in the Dooars tomorrow.         
	Police prevented them from holding a rally in nearby Malbazar today.        
	The chief minister has reminded the Morcha leader of the decision following last months tripartite meeting in Delhi that there will be no demonstration in the hills when the talks on their demands are on, Sen said.         
	The chief minister was closeted with chief secretary Asok Mohan Chakrabarti, state police chief A.B. Vohra, Siliguri MLA Asok Bhattacharya and Sen this morning for a review of the situation in the Dooars and Darjeeling.        
	The government, Sen said after the meeting, was concerned over frequent clashes involving Morcha supporters and the Advasis in Jalpaiguri and its adjoining areas.         
	 We want a stop to such things (the clashes), he added.        
	The Akhil Bharatiya Adivasi Parishad, opposed to the Morcha demand for a separate Gorkhaland, including the Dooars, the Terai and Darjeeling, has foiled its attempts to hold rallies in the plains.         
	The Siliguri MLA said the government had taken a serious view of the Dooars clashes because they had assumed an ethnic colour. The government cannot sit idle at this juncture. That is why it has asked for central forces, said Bhattacharya, also the urban development minister.         
	Four companies of central forces have been requisitioned for deployment in Jalpaiguri. Morcha leaders had yesterday accused the police of using the Adivasis against them.        
	Party general secretary Roshan Giri, who is camping in Gorubathan  on the edge of the Dooars and around 150km from Darjeeling town  said Jalpaiguri divisional commissioner B.L. Meena had informed the party brass about the chief ministers letter.

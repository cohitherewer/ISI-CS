	New Delhi, Dec. 21: With two days left for the Jharkhand verdict to be pronounced, the only question haunting the BJP is whether it would be a close miss or a long shot to power.        
	And given the twists and turns that the month-long poll campaign saw  a la Madhu Koda, the conclusion within the party was that if it touched 35 or 36 and was five or six short of the magic figure of 41, then it was worth its while to court the smaller parties and have a shot at government formation.        
	Anything short, its not worth even attempting, said a Lok Sabha MP.         
	Initially, the BJP had hoped to start as favourites and the odds were stacked up in its favour: the Congress could not have an alliance with any of its former allies so it was assumed that the secular (non-Congress) votes would split.         
	The BJP believed the Congress would have to pay hugely  first for backing Koda as chief minister and then washing its hands off when corruption charges caught up with him and his associates.        
	Lastly, its optimism was based on the perception that price rise would go against the Congress. If despite all this, corruption at the grassroots manifest in the irregularities in BPL card distribution, the Indira Awas Yojana, etc, in the complete lack of security to life and limb, we are not at an advantage, then mere introspection will not do, said a BJP MP from Jharkhand.         
	We need to commission a serious survey in every village and every hamlet to find out how people vote and what issues excite them and what do not, he added, but maintained that the talking points they raised found an echo in minds and hearts.        
	A party functionary involved with the Jharkhand polls pointed to a possible turnaround in perception mid-way through the campaign when the BJP decided to shift its focus away from Koda to generic issues.         
	We committed a strategic mistake by converting the battle between BJP and Koda because this helped the Congress to distance itself from Koda and make him a symbol of corruption for which it was equally, if not more, responsible. We then began concentrating on the Congress but perhaps it was too late, he admitted.        
	The BJPs flawed approach impacted the urban votes that were polled in its favour since the late 80s.        
	This time, we realised that price rise and corruption didnt matter that much. Stability was the point, so the votes went in equal measure to the Congress, explained a party source.        
	The logic probably was that with a Congress-led government at the Centre it was safer to vote for it here as well so that Jharkhand gets a stable dispensation, he added.        
	As for the alliance that former chief minister Babulal Marandi struck with the Congress, its impact was hard to quantify.        
	Marandi started off as a spoiler. But mid-way our committed voters stayed with us and ditched him. So the alliance will have different results in each phase, the source said.

          GAJINDER SINGH                            The bullet-proof cabin mounted atop the mini-truck                                  
	Chandigarh, July 1: Punjab police have put together a vehicle-mounted bullet-proof cabin that can be raised to a height of up to three stories to take on terrorists perched in vantage positions.        
	The cabin, made of special steel with openings big enough to allow clear vision, can hoist four to five armed personnel to a height of 20ft. It can also be used to lift ammunition up to 15kg in uneven terrain.         
	Two machine guns are fitted to the cabin which can be moved up and down with the support of four devices called hydraulic stabilisers.        
	The cabin, mounted atop a mini-truck, is expected to be of big help in anti-terror operations in residential areas and hostage crises, officials said. It could also work well in situations like the one during last years Mumbai attack, where commandos fought gunmen holed up at the top of buildings, they added.        
	Hoisted platforms are used by firefighters and civic agencies maintaining street lights, for instance, but they arent bullet-proof and cant carry as much load.        
	The vehicle can be used for deterrence and domination during terror attacks as it provides security forces with a clear view from a higher level, state police chief K.K. Attri said after Punjab chief minister Parkash Singh Badal unveiled the vehicle at his residence yesterday morning.        
	Attri, who retired yesterday, said the vehicle had been designed by the polices special wing, which has engineers among its ranks, in consultation with the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO).         
	Gopalji Mishra, who heads the special wing and was closely involved with the design, said: We wanted a bullet-proof police post that could have a clear view of operations. There are four hydraulic stabilisers as the cabin is heavy.        
	The special wings innovations dont end there. It has recently introduced a robot, again designed in-house, that can detect bombs 100 metres away. This is an improvement on the US-made robots the force already has on two counts.         
	The US robots come at Rs 12 lakh each. The cost of the robots we designed is Rs 25,000. The foreign ones can detect bombs only within 50 metres and can lift 5kg of explosives. But our own robots can carry 12kg, Mishra said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Nuke fissures persist with ally Japan
                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                Nuke fissures persist with ally Japan
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                             Yukio Hatoyama                                  
	New Delhi, Dec. 29: India and Japan disagreed today on ratifying the nuclear Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT) and the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) but decided to take to a new stage their partnership in defence and increase bilateral trade.         
	While the two countries concurred on the no-first-use principle, moratorium on nuclear testing and an early conclusion to the Fissile Material Cut Off Treaty (FMCT), Japanese Prime Minister Yukio Hatoyama wanted India to sign the CTBT.         
	But Prime Minister Manmohan Singh put the onus on the US and China for taking a lead by ratifying the CTBT.         
	I expressed the hope that along with the US and China, India will sign and ratify the (CTBT) treaty. In response, Prime Minister Singh said should the US and China ratify the CTBT, a new situation will emerge. I believe he has stated it as a matter of fact. We firmly have to engage in these endeavours, said Hatoyama.         
	Although Delhis hopes for civil nuclear co-operation with Japan were dashed, at least for the immediate future, Hatoyama did keep open a window. It is an important agenda for the future, said the Japanese Prime Minister, who concluded his three-day state visit to India today.        
	Energy ministers will exchange views and information on their respective nuclear energy policies, said the joint statement released after the annual summit talks between the two Prime Ministers.         
	But on other issues, particularly defence co-operation, progress was made. The two nations will have an annual strategic 2+2 dialogue at the levels of the foreign and defence ministers and secretary or joint secretary.        
	An action plan to advance security co-operation envisages annual bilateral naval exercises and student/researcher exchange at defence institutes. A joint working Group for intelligence sharing on terrorism will be set up.         
	 Prime Minister Hatoyamas visit has succeeded in taking our partnership to a new stage, said Singh.         
	Visa norms        
	Japan and India wanted either side to relax their visa norms. I requested Prime Minister Hatoyama to ensure that the Japanese visa system becomes more liberal to enable faster growth of trade, investment and people-to-people contact, Singh said.         
	He added that the Japanese leader had mentioned restrictive features in the Indian visa system and that he had promised to look into it.        
	Japan considers difficult visa norms to be one of the roadblocks hampering growth in bilateral trade. I asked for co-operation in the procedure of visa issuance. Several major projects are being undertaken in India, the Japanese Prime Minister said.         
	The joint declaration has proposed a comprehensive economic partnership agreement.

                                                                                                           Universities should be given full autonomy: Yashpal
                                  
	New Delhi, Aug 8 (PTI): Advocating the need for complete overhauling of the present higher education system, a renowned educationist today asked the government to give quot;full autonomy quot; to universities to decide their curriculum and implement it.              
	 quot;The universities should be given free hand in deciding their design of curriculum and the way to conduct different courses, quot; Prof Yashpal, who headed a government-constituted committee aimed at suggesting reforms in higher education, said here.              
	Addressing a debate session at the Indian Council of Social Science Research, he said an inter-disciplinary approach was required to boost innovation in the system.              
	 quot;Interaction among students belonging to different streams at college and university level is necessary to bring out innovation and new ideas which come through the boundaries of discipline, quot; Yashpal said.

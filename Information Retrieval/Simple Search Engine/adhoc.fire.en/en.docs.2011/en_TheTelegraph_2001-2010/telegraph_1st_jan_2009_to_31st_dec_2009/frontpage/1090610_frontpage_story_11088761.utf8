	Ranchi, June 9: With barely 24 hours left for filing of nomination papers for the Rajya Sabha election, the Congress high command today named Dheeraj Prasad Sahu as its candidate for one of the two seats vacant in the state.        
	Dheeraj, the brother of late Congress MP Shiv Prasad Sahu, lost the recently held Lok Sabha elections from Chatra. He is the state treasurer of the party. The Congress is trying to match the BJPs moves and woo the business community by nominating Sahu as its candidate, said a party leader.         
	The BJP yesterday fielded Ajay Maroo and Anup Agrawal, both from the business community. The JD(U), a BJP ally, is yet to decide whether it will support the two nominees. The BJP has not been maintaining the coalition dharma and is taking decisions unilaterally. Our central leaders will decide soon, said JD(U) state unit president Jaleshwar Mahto.        
	The JMM has not formally announced a nominee, though Shibu Soren is reportedly planning to field son Hemant.         
	Elections are slated for June 20. All nominees will have to file their nominations by 4pm tomorrow.        
	Significantly, the Election Commissions decision to hold polling for both seats separately does not hold out much hope for the NDA under normal circumstances. It will take at least 38 legislators to win a seat given the current state Assembly strength of 73. The BJP with 24 legislators and four from JD(U) stands no chance unless there is cross-voting.         
	Both Congress and JMM have decided to contest one seat each and extend support to each others candidate. The Congress-JMM-RJD combine together has 33 seats and will require five more legislators for which they are banking on Bandhu Tirkey, Bhanu Pratap Sahi, Stephen Marandi, Joba Manjhi and Aparna Sengupta.        
	Balmuchu, who is camping in New Delhi, said that RJD leaders Raghuvansh Prasad Singh and Prem Gupta had pledged their support to the Congress nominee  a decision the state RJD said it was not aware of. Nobody got in touch, said RJD state president Gautam Sagar Rana.         
	Meanwhile, the BJP held a meeting of its legislators in an attempt to keep its flock together.         
	The two seats fell vacant after Yashwant Sinha and Digvijay Singh, members in the Upper House from Jharkhand, were elected to the Lok Sabha from Hazaribagh and Banka. Their tenure was to expire on July 7, 2010.

          G.S. MUDUR                             Bill Gates: Helping hand                                  
	New Delhi, Oct. 20: A Calcutta doctors idea for a new tool to detect relapse of malaria and a Delhi scientists proposal to develop a breath test for tuberculosis have attracted funding support from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.         
	Three research ideas from India are among 76 proposals from scientists worldwide that have each bagged $100,000 support under the foundations Grand Challenge Explorations, a project that seeks to foster innovation in health research.        
	Abanindra Kumar Nag, director of the Vivekananda Institute of Health Sciences, Calcutta, had sought funding for his idea to use a mix of ultrasound scans and liver function tests to diagnose malaria relapse.         
	It is currently very hard to distinguish between relapse and reinfection, Nag told The Telegraph. The malaria parasite may sometimes continue to proliferate in the liver and patients may show up with symptoms twice of thrice a year, he said.        
	His preliminary studies have shown that parasite colonisation of the liver may be distinguished through a combination of ultrasound scans of the liver and the spleen and blood tests that examine a set of liver enzymes.         
	We need to establish this idea in a large number of patients, Nag said. Over the next year, he and his colleagues hope to verify their early findings through these tests on several hundred patients.         
	In Delhi, protein chemist Rajan Nanda plans to use the Grand Challenge Explorations funding to validate his observations of subtle differences in breath samples of healthy persons and infected patients with active TB.         
	Nanda and his colleagues at the International Centre for Genetic Engineering and Biotechnology plan to collect breath samples of healthy individuals and TB patients, analyse volatile organic compounds through gas chromatography.        
	Weve identified some candidate molecules that appear to be uniquely associated with TB, Nanda said. This will have to be rigorously tested with more samples.        
	Deepak Gaur, also at the ICGEB, is the third Indian recipient for his plan to develop a new blood-stage malaria vaccine to inhibit the invasion of the malaria parasite into its target red blood cells.         
	This is seed funding to demonstrate one critical experiment for continued support, said Andrew Serazin, programme officer with the Grand Challenge Explorations.

                                Fnd of worries                            
	London, June 25: A pioneering new computer programme that predicts if and when men will go bald is being offered to British men.         
	The baldness calculator  said to be the worlds first reliable tool for predicting hair loss  has been a huge hit with men.         
	The programme calculates the exact age at which someone will go bald or have lost most of their hair or provides reassurance by predicting that they will still have a full head of hair in old age.         
	More than half a million German men used it within ten days of it being unveiled there and three million men have tried it out globally so far.         
	Sixty per cent of users of the calculator to date have been young men aged between 15 and 30. Two thirds of all British men will eventually suffer hair loss, according to recent research.         
	The programme asks users about their age, marital status, occupation, where they live, what their current hairline is, hair loss in their family and their stress levels.         
	German scientists devised the programme because half of men in their country suffer from hereditary hair loss.         
	Adolf Klenk, head of research and development at hair care firm Dr Kurt Wolff, said: More and more men value full hair but especially younger men.        
	They are looking for a partner and are at the peak of their social lives. They are very conscious about their looks and being accepted within their social groups. They get concerned that if they lose their hair, they will cease to be attractive to others whereas older men dont care so much.        
	Klenk said that men with a history of hair loss on either their mother or fathers side of the family are most at risk of going bald.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Cong sups with Left to teach Mamata a lesson 
                                                                                                           Cong sups with Left to teach Mamata a lesson 
          BARUN GHOSH AND OUR BUREAU                                               
	Oct. 1: The Congress today stunned the Trinamul Congress by snatching the reins of the Siliguri Municipal Corporation with the help of the Left, finally sending a stern message to Mamata Banerjee that the party would no longer blindly accept terms set by her.        
	Both the posts of mayor and chairperson in the civic body were bagged today by the Congress which had fought the popular election in alliance with Trinamul and ended the 28-year reign of the Left in its north Bengal redoubt.        
	Gangotri Dutta and Sabita Devi Agarwal of the Congress were elected mayor and chairperson, respectively, after the partys district president wrote a letter to local Left boss and minister Asok Bhattacharya.        
	In the 47-councillor corporation, the Congress and Trinamul were tied with 15 each. However, once the Left tilted the balance, the Congresss mayor candidate got 32 votes against Trinamuls 15 and the chairperson nominee bagged 32 against none for the rival as the rest had walked out.        
	The Congresss assertive streak represented a turnaround from the way it had been meekly surrendering to Trinamul since the run-up to the Lok Sabha elections.        
	It was left to the Congress MP from Raiganj, Deepa Das Munshi, to call Mamatas bluff. That there is no love lost between the two women is no secret. For Deepa, the battle for Siliguri had both a local and a larger dimension.        
	North Bengal is the Congresss last fort in Bengal; Mamata has already taken over the Opposition space in the rest of the state. Conceding Siliguri to Trinamul would have meant allowing Mamata to threaten Deepas and the Congresss own backyard.        
	Unlike in the general election and in the bypolls to Sealdah and Bowbazar Assembly seats, Deepa could persuade the party high command that she be allowed to enforce her writ against Mamata.        
	Since the municipal poll results were announced on September 15, Deepa has been in constant touch with senior party leaders.         
	I have been regularly giving an update to both Pranabda (Mukherjee, Bengal Congress president) and Raoji (K. Keshava Rao, AICC general secretary in charge of Bengal) for over a fortnight. Even this morning, I informed them about the Left backing. They okayed my initiative, she said.         
	Going by Deepas statements, it appears that though the high command publicly maintained that it had left the Siliguri battle to local leaders, it stood by her to keep Trinamul at bay.        
	The Congresss defiance of Mamata in Siliguri may not necessarily be the beginning of the end of the Bengal alliance. The Congress central leadership today insisted the alliance was intact, suggesting it just wanted to show it could take a few risks in the battle of nerves with the mercurial ally.        
	It is unlikely the Congress-Left understanding in Siliguri will be repeated in next years civic elections or in the 2011 Assembly polls.        
	But the Congresss new-found boldness, especially its decision to take the Lefts help, has the potential to add new dimensions to Bengals politics. The Siliguri move has served two purposes for the party.        
	First, it has signalled the Congresss defiance of Mamata, preparing it for tougher bargains with Trinamul in next years polls to 82 civic bodies, including the Calcutta Municipal Corporation, and the Assembly elections in 2011.        
	Second, it has opened up possibilities of a Congress-Left rapprochement at a strategic level. In that sense, Siliguri has witnessed a reversal of Prakash Karats policy of a complete breakdown in Congress-communist understanding. All 17 Left Front councillors could not have voted for the Congress without state CPM leaders approval. A state CPM leader today said the party distinguishes between the Congress and Trinamul.        
	Making or breaking alliances is not new at the municipal or panchayat levels. Parties frequently take the help of their rivals to form boards at the lower level.        
	But the Siliguri episode is the first big jolt to the Congress-Trinamul alliance.         
	By accepting the Lefts help, the Congress has also taken a gamble. Mamata has accused the Congress of getting into an unholy nexus with the CPM for usurping power in Siliguri. She alleged that the Congress had betrayed the people of Siliguri.        
	A Congress leader said: Mamata will definitely look for an opportunity to humiliate us in the near future.

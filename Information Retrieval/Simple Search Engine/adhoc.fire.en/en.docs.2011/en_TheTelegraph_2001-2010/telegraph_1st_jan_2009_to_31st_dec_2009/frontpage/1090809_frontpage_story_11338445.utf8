	London, Aug. 8: Barbra Streisand, the singer, has donated more than 400 personal items for auction including performance costumes, paintings, furniture and other collectables to benefit her charity.        
	Fans of the 67 year-old will be able to bid on objects as diverse as a wicker chair from her sun room, a Dior trouser suit she wore to the 1986 Grammys and a phonograph she bought when she was 18.        
	Items from the sale, including costumes from Funny Girl and Meet the Fockers, will be brought to Britain on the Queen Mary 2 cruise liner later this month and will then go on show in Newbridge, Co Kildare, Ireland, in September. The sale will be held in New York on October 17 and 18.        
	 The proceeds will go to the Streisand Foundation, which supports womens, childrens, environmental and political causes. Streisand said she decided to shed items from her Beverly Hills, Malibu and New York homes because she was through with extra stuff.        
	What good does it do in storage? Let someone else enjoy it. These things, theyre not forever. We pass them on and reap the benefits for something important, she said. Im a collector, so one collects and collects and collects. But now I have enough stuff, so its a good time to clean the closets.

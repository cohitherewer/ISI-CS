  - After Lahore, Pak Taliban chief vows to attack White House           NASIR JAFFRY AND AGENCIES                                       
	Lahore, March 31: Police hunted for clues into yesterdays attack on the Manawan police training academy even as the commander of a Pakistani Taliban group claimed responsibility for the strike.        
	The chief of the Tehrik-i-Taliban, Baitullah Mehsud, today took responsibility for the attack that began around 7.15am yesterday and ended after eight hours.              
	Yes, we have carried out this attack. I will give details later, Mehsud, an al Qaida-linked leader based in the Waziristan tribal region told Reuters by telephone.        
	Commandos had captured an alleged assailant said to be of Afghan origins from the near-by fields a couple of hours before the academy was secured. Security forces were unwilling to let out details, but the suspected gunman was said to be one Hazrat Gul from South Waziristan, which has been under attack from US missiles.        
	Interior ministry chief Rehman Malik said the person arrested was loyal to Mehsud, but police officials refused to comment.        
	We have one person in custody and the information gleaned from him is beneficial, said Khwaja Khalid Farooq, chief of the Punjab provincial police force.        
	Two hand-grenades, a knife, a walkie-talkie set and a passport in his name were recovered from him. Another three attackers blew themselves up when they found themselves cornered following the final assault launched by commandos on the academy located on GT Road around 10km away from the Wagah border with India.        
	So far seven police cadets and one civilian are said to have died in the audacious attack. About 780 police trainees and 100 school staff  instructors, policemen, cooks, etc, were present inside the centre when the attack came.        
	Around 50 suspects have been detained in overnight raids for possible links to the attackers. Private TV stations reported that 40 suspects have been arrested from the Dinnur district of Dera Ismail Khan as of Tuesday morning.        
	Three men suspected to be involved in the assault were also taken into custody when they were trying to escape from the academy premises in police uniforms. They were removed to an unidentified place for interrogation. The interrogation is moving in a positive direction, said Farooq.        
	Waseem Sail, a senior police officer who co-ordinated the final assault yesterday, said fingerprints of three attackers had been found from the premises. Some of the cadets inside said the gunmen were speaking in Pashtun language, but others said the attackers were also talking Punjabi.        
	There were contradictory reports about the number of gunmen. Eyewitnesses claimed at least 10 men had attacked the police school. But police officers, who took part in the operation, said it was unclear how many gunmen were involved.        
	Theres a strong possibility that some of them might have left the place after helping their fellow attackers capture the building by throwing hand-grenades at the trainees in the morning, Dawn newspaper quoted a police official as saying.        
	The injured, around 95 of them, who are being treated in hospitals will not be allowed to leave without security check as the investigators suspected some assailants might have mingled with them in order to escape arrest.        
	Security forces recaptured the police centre only after sustained heavy firing that continued for several hours. The troops on the ground were aided by heavy firing from an army helicopter during the final shootout with the attackers.        
	Lahore general officer commanding Major-General Shafqat Ahmed said the gunmen were restricted to the schools top floor as result of the joint rescue operation of the army, Rangers and elite police force. He said the security forces had recovered hand-grenades, small weapons and some explosives from the scene.        
	Mourners gathered for funeral prayers for seven of the dead at a police building in downtown Lahore today. The coffins, wrapped in Pakistani flags, were lined up under a canopy.         
	Police, who have been widely criticised as the soft target for extremists attacking the security forces in Pakistan, enforced heavy security for the funerals and armed commandos deployed on rooftops around the building.         
	Police instructor Mohammad Iqbal, who received injuries to the spine and head, speculated the attack was to avenge the 2007 security operation against radicals holed up in the Lal Masjid in Islamabad.         
	What I vividly remember is that they kept hurling grenades and fired from the second floor of the building where they later got trapped, and every time they shouted Allahu akbar (God is the greatest), he said.         
	My hunch is they took revenge on us for the Lal Masjid operation.

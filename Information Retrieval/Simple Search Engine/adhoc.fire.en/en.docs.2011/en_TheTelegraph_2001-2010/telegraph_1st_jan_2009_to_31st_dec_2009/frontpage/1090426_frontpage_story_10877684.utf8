	Islamabad, April 25 (AP): Taliban gunmen stopped an army convoy from entering their valley stronghold today, casting a US-criticised peace deal back into doubt a day after the militants called off a move closer to the Pakistani capital.        
	About 50 militants blocked the main road leading into the northwestern valley of Swat, halting a column of six army trucks and two jeeps, Taliban spokesman Muslim Khan said.        
	The vehicles were carrying extra troops as well as supplies, in violation of the peace accord, Khan told The Associated Press by telephone.        
	A military official confirmed the incident and said the convoy returned to the nearby town of Bari Kot. He declined to give details and spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorised to discuss it publicly.        
	Pakistani authorities agreed in February to impose Islamic law in Swat in return for a ceasefire after nearly two years of bloody fighting in the former tourist haven.        
	US officials and many Pakistani critics view the pact as a capitulation before extremists who have beheaded opponents, burnt girls schools and said they would welcome and protect Osama bin Laden. It also grants the militants effective immunity from prosecution.        
	 Western officials worry that Swat could turn into an expanding haven for al Qaida allies. The trouble also diverts Pakistan from tackling more established militant sanctuaries closer to the Afghan border.        
	But the deals supporters argue that the concession on Islamic law robs hardliners of any justification for continuing to bear arms.        
	The pact has been under huge strain since President Asif Ali Zardari signed the bill earlier this month introducing Islamic law in Swat and the surrounding Malakand region, an area of about 25,900 squarekm near the Afghan border. Taliban gunmen used the deal as a pretext to sweep over the high passes from Swat.

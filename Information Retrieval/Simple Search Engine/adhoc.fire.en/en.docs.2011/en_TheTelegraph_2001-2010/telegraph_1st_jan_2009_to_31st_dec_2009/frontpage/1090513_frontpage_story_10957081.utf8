The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Racism or not, strain shows 
                                                                                                           Racism or not, strain shows 
          PRATIM D. GUPTA                            Buchanan                                  
	Centurion, May 12: Coach John Buchanan today dismissed allegations of an Indian-foreigner racial divide in the Kolkata Knight Riders as rubbish, but the team huddle at the fall of a wicket might hide a bit more than what the eye sees.        
	A strain, even if it isnt racist, is apparent from the way the bruised and battered KKR has been carrying itself on and off the field here in South Africa.        
	Buchanan, however, brushed aside accusations of racism. We have heard the statement. Its such an inane comment. Its rubbish. I dont think theres any need to make any further comment because all that it seems to ensure is that we are asked the same question again.        
	Buchanan was referring to former cricketer Ajay Jadejas statement on a television channel that he had learnt from friends in KKR that some Indian players were being ill-treated by the foreign support staff.        
	Its rubbish, Knight Riders captain, New Zealands Brendon McCullum, seconded his Australian coach, sitting next to him this evening after another defeat.        
	Jadeja had also claimed that an Indian player, who had questioned why he had been asked to come off while fielding, was told by one of the assistant coaches: You bloody Indian, you do as youre told.        
	PTI quoted NDTV as suggesting that the two involved were Test discard Ajit Agarkar and bowling coach Andy Bichel.        
	KKR team director Joy Bhattacharjya said the team was in very bad shape but racism was not a problem. Whatever else we have as a problem, racism is not a problem in our team, he told The Telegraph.        
	Hot words can be exchanged between any two people. We all do not need to agree with everything. But racism is not our problem in life. I, as an Indian, would never ever tolerate something like that and I would have been the first to leave if that ever was an issue.        
	Strong words, but the question on a likely divide was waiting to be asked.        
	Whether its during lunchtime, when the foreign members would eat together and the Indian players grab a bite on their own, or at stadiums, a rift is palpable.        
	Even tonight, at the SuperSport Park, a David Hussey would help McCullum set the field while an Arindam Ghosh would raise a hand of apology to Sourav Ganguly after a misfield.        
	On his part, Buchanan, too, had made it clear that given a chance he would pack the entire team with foreign players. Before every match there is a temptation to play every foreign player but only four are allowed and we have to look at the balance of the side, he said on Sunday night.        
	If Buchanans critics say he set the foreign tone by replacing Ganguly with McCullum as the skipper, theres nearly one foreign coach for every one of the playing XI.        
	Besides Buchanan, the support staff include chief coach Mathew Mott, assistant coach Brad Murphy, wicket-keeping coach Wade Seccombe, bowling coach Andy Bichel, assistant coach for strength training Michael Buchanan (Buchanans son), trainer Adrian Le Roux, physiotherapist Andrew Leipus and fielding coach Jon Deeble.        
	Deeble, Seccombe and Murphy were with the team for the first four matches before they left along with Sanjay Bangar and Akash Chopra, the two Indians who were sent back.

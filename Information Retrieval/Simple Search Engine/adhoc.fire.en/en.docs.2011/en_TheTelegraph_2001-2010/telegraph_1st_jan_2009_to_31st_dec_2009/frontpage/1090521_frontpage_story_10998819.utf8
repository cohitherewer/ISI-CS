	New Delhi, May 20: Sonia Gandhi and Manmohan Singh were relaxed and smiling as they stepped out of Rashtrapati Bhavan this evening to announce that he would be sworn in Prime Minister for the second time on Friday.        
	The lone sign of disquiet was a mid-summer dust storm on Raisina Hill.         
	But away from the popping flashbulbs, Congress emissaries were toiling to convince the DMK that the coalition equations have changed and allies no longer enjoy the primacy they did over the past 13 years.        
	The efforts to persuade the DMK to bring down its demand for berths from a revised seven to five did not succeed till this evening. As many as four relatives of M. Karunanidhi are in the race. The talks will resume tomorrow.        
	On the forecourt of Rashtrapati Bhavan, Singh said the UPA had the support of 322 MPs, of whom 274 were part of the coalition. He sidestepped questions on which parties made up the 274 and whether they would all be part of the government. You will come to know in the course of time, Singh said, seasoned after five years in office.        
	The only suspense today was on the parties that would be in the government and those that would stay out, and neither he nor Sonia ended it, perhaps because they did not want to show their hand before ministry allocation is wrapped up.         
	Some old-timers blamed the quibble on what they dubbed in jest the forecourt jinx  a reference to Sonias statement in 1999 at the same spot that we have 272. But the calculation went awry when Mulayam Singh Yadav somersaulted.        
	Manmohan was beside Sonia then. So was he today, but both looking far more at ease than they were at another memorable appearance on the forecourt on May 19, 2004. When Sonia had come out of Rashtrapati Bhavan five years ago to announce that the nation would be safe in the hands of Singh, the Congress president had looked relieved, even prompting the media to ask her about it.        
	She was smiling today, as then, but it did not invite comment.        
	If Singh was just a little diffident then  I know my limitations, he had said  he sounded confident after an election win that is also being credited to his governments performance.        
	The RJD, Samajwadi Party and the BSP had offered support, Singh said, making a distinction between the parties that had given their letters to the President and the pre-poll allies and Independents whom he counted in the 274.         
	The count would be 275, but since a JMM MP is in jail and will not be voting, the Prime Minister might have not taken him into account.                  
	Earlier in the day, the Congress and its pre-poll allies met at 10 Janpath. It is expected that every party that attended the meeting will be part of the cabinet, Congress spokesperson Janardhan Dwivedi said, adding the status of the Samajwadi Party or the RJD was not discussed.         
	Instead of another common minimum programme, a committee of the Congress and its allies would peruse the existing one and make changes by consensus.        
	A Rashtrapati Bhavan communique said: The President appointed Dr Manmohan Singh as the Prime Minister and requested him to indicate the members of the new council of ministers.        
	That task now rests on the outcome of the talks Pranab Mukherjee, Ghulam Nabi Azad and Ahmed Patel are holding with the 18-member DMK, the largest partner of the Congress after the Trinamul Congress. Congress sources said the DMK wanted more berths than the formula of one ministry for every seven MPs entitled them to.

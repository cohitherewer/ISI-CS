          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Ranchi, Dec. 20: The Enforcement Directorate (ED) has begun sending letters rogatory to the external affairs ministry for delivery to Indian consulates in the UAE, Thailand, Indonesia, Sweden and Liberia, requesting information on the nature and extent of money laundering by former chief minister Madhu Koda and his close associates, Vinod Sinha and Sanjay Choudhury.        
	A team of ED officials, who were in Ranchi yesterday, obtained the letters rogatory issued by the designated court of Pankaj Kumar. Sources said the ED had also drawn up detailed questionnaires, which would be attached to every individual letter. Special public prosecutor Sushil Ranjan Das said on December 9, the designated ED court in Ranchi had acceded to a prayer by sleuths, requesting issuance of the letters to concerned courts in the five countries.        
	According to an established procedure, the letters rogatory will be vetted by the external affairs ministry before being sent to Indian consulates in the other countries. The consulates, in turn, will forward them to courts in cities where substantial investments have allegedly been made by Koda and his associates.        
	An ED team from Delhi is, meanwhile, expected to arrive in Ranchi to resume interrogating Koda and his former ministerial colleague, Kamlesh Singh.                     
	Both are currently lodged at Birsa Munda Central Jail, Ranchi, for possessing assets disproportionate to their known sources of income. They were shifted back to the jail from Rajendra Institute of Medical Sciences yesterday.         
	On December 18, the designated ED court had granted permission to the directorate to grill Koda and Singh in custody.        
	The vigilance bureau, too, is gearing up to interrogate the duo. IG (vigilance) M.V. Rao, who returned from Garhwa yesterday evening, said they would quiz the two former ministers this week.

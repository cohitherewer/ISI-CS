  - Kal Penn suicide in House, rebirth in White House           K.P. NAYAR                            Kal Penn                                        
	Washington, April 8: Following in the footsteps of M.G. Ramachandran, N.T. Rama Rao and Jayalalithaa, an Indian American has left lucrative Hollywood and moved into full-time politics. Actor Kal Penn will be right at the centre of it  in the White House.        
	The appointment of Penn, whose real name is Kalpen Suresh Modi, as associate director of the White House office of public liaison and intergovernmental affairs, has already become a household sensation in America because the character played by Penn in House, an award-winning TV medical drama, inexplicably committed suicide on the small screen on Monday night.        
	The suicide of Dr Lawrence Kutner  Penns character in the TV series  was necessary to take him out of future episodes of the House so that he can immediately join President Barack Obamas outreach project for Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders.        
	Penns appointment and Dr Kutners small screen suicide set the US media on fire today with screaming tabloid headlines like House to White House. Even The Washington Post, the normally sober national daily, had a risque headline Kumar goes to Washington to announce Penns decision to join Obamas inner circle. The reference was to Penns roles in the Harold amp; Kumar films: Penn fictionally smokes marijuana with a likeness of President George W. Bush in one of them.        
	Unlike other peripheral Indian American appointments in the Obama administration so far, Penn, who played Gogol in The Namesake that is partly set in Calcutta, will interact closely and directly with the Chicago crowd from Obamas hometown who have taken the White House in their grip.        
	Penns role in the White House will be more political than administrative, mobilising Asian Americans, thus setting him on a course for eventual public office if he chooses politics over films.        
	His boss in the new job will be Valerie Jarrett, a Chicagoan who is senior adviser and assistant to the President for public liaison and intergovernmental affairs.         
	Jarrett was the powerful co-chair of the Obama-Biden presidential transition team and earlier served as senior adviser to Obamas presidential campaign. She was finance chair for Obamas first foray into national politics: his 2004 candidacy for the US Senate.        
	Equally important, Penns main point man in his new role will be Michael Strautmanis, chief of staff to Jarrett. Strautmanis has a long association with Michelle Obama, from the time he was paralegal for the First Lady at the Chicago law firm Sidley amp; Austin.        
	Penns other point person will be Christina Tchen, director of White House public liaison, who was, among other things, on the board of the Chicago Bar Foundation.        
	Being within earshot of this Chicago trio, Penn has the potential not only to be the eyes and ears of the White House but also to be in a position to put across ideas and be a part of the kitchen table discussions in the presidential mansion.        
	Penn will only earn between $60,000 and $70,000 annually in his White House job. His income was about as much for a single episode of the House TV serial.        
	Obama has been a viewer of the House and as presidential aspirant he told Penn the doctor show. Nice work! when the two men met for the first time in 2007.        
	The Indian American actor, who will be 32 on April 23, campaigned intensely for Obama during the 2008 presidential campaign among young people and in unversities.        
	Along with Beyonce, Bruce Springsteen and Stevie Wonder, he rolled out We Are One, the huge concert at the Lincoln Memorial here which set in motion Obamas three-day swearing-in celebrations on January 18.        
	Penns role at We Are One was to inspire the crowd by reading out quotes from President Dwight D. Eisenhower.        
	A vegetarian, Penn said in speeches during the Obama campaign that he was drawn to politics by stories from his Gujarati parents of having marched with Mahatma Gandhi during Indias freedom struggle.

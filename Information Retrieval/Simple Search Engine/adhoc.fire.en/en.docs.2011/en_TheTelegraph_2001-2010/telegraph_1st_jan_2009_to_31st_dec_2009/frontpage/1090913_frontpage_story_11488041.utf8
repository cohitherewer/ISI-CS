The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Austerity axe falls on MP hike
                                                                                                           Austerity axe falls on MP hike
  - Backlash fear prompts govt to go slow on plan to step up allowance for research        RADHIKA RAMASESHAN                                                  
	New Delhi, Sept. 12: The Centre has junked a plan to raise MPs salaries and allowances it was considering even last month.        
	The move came as austerity became the watchword after Sonia Gandhi asked her ministers and MPs to take a 20 per cent pay cut because of the drought threat and grim economic outlook.        
	A raise seems unlikely this year, a government source said.        
	Sources confirmed that MPs were set to get a huge increase in daily allowances so they could hire researchers and resource persons to bone up on esoteric subjects.        
	The Congresss young MPs, who, with exceptions such as Manish Tewari, have been reticent in the two sessions of the 15th Lok Sabha so far, had been asking for bigger staff to not just enhance their knowledge but also brief them on parliamentary procedures and etiquette.        
	The Centre was about to raise their constituency allowance following an unofficial diktat from the high command to MPs to spend every weekend in their constituencies and set up an office to sort out voters problems.        
	But against this was a perception that if the MPs treated themselves to a raise in a time of slowdown, they would become objects of contempt, derision and perhaps hatred, a Congress source said. Our leaders are sensitive to middle-class opinion. This class hates politicians, and imagine the consequences if we gave ourselves bigger salaries.        
	Not every MP is pleased. Unless we get increased secretarial allowance, MPs will not be able to function effectively and Parliament quorums will remain abysmal, Congress spokesperson and Ludhiana MP Manish Tewari said. The frontiers of knowledge have expanded and new laws cover sunrise areas that are specialised and complex.        
	Tewari, a lawyer, has an office back-up. The only other MP who acknowledges he has engaged researchers is the Samajwadi Partys Amar Singh.        
	BJP Rajya Sabha MP Rajiv Pratap Rudy was resigned: If the government is not in a position to (hike pay), Parliament can do nothing unilaterally.        
	The last raise for MPs came in August 2006, when the economy was robust. The exchequer took the Rs 60-crore bill in its stride.        
	MPs monthly salary and constituency allowance had then risen from Rs 12,000 to Rs 16,000 and from Rs 10,000 to Rs 20,000, respectively. The daily allowance when Parliament was in session was doubled from Rs 500 to Rs 1,000.        
	Earlier, MPs salaries and allowances had stayed unchanged from 1964 to 1983. In 1985, when the Congress won a huge majority, the government felt generous and raised the salary from Rs 750 to Rs 1,000. In 1988, the pay rose to Rs 1,500. Ten years later, the United Front government hiked it to Rs 4,000, before the Vajpayee government trebled it to Rs 12,000 in 2001.        
	India is one of the few countries where MPs can give themselves a raise, by amending the Salaries, Allowances and Pension of Members of Parliament Act, 1954. Once the government moots a proposal, a joint parliamentary committee considers it and makes recommendations that are usually accepted.        
	For instance, in 2001, the K.P. Singh Deo panel successfully asked for a three-fold increase to Rs 12,000 with a proportional rise in perks.        
	CPM member Brinda Karat is among the few MPs who think lawmakers should forfeit the right to decide their pay cheques.        
	Its not a question of being sensitive to austerity or this or that principle. The process should be open, transparent and linked to standards. Just as employees cannot decide their salaries, it is outrageous that MPs can, she said.        
	A suggestion about forming an independent wage commission, in vogue in some countries, didnt excite the Indian lawmakers. Some felt that substantial salaries and allowances would prevent corruption.        
	Against this, a Congress veteran invoked the Mahatma, who had said such an argument means that to prevent a man from taking a bribe occasionally, he should be paid a permanent bribe in the form of a big salary.        
	Economy stampede        
	Pranab Mukherjee today flew to Calcutta on a budget airline, prompting colleagues such as Praful Patel, Veerappa Moily and Anand Sharma to vow that they would also cut travel costs. Mamata Banerjee, who flies economy class, has asked her partys six ministers to do the same.         
	Congress spokesperson Shakeel Ahmed said ministers who were tall or plump were exempt from flying economy class.

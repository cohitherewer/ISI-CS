The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Gogoi mulls outside agencies for projects
                                                                                                           Gogoi mulls outside agencies for projects
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Guwahati, Aug. 22: Chief minister Tarun Gogoi today said implementation of all government projects in the state will be evaluated by outside agencies for proper utilisation of funds.        
	Apart from monitoring by our own agencies, non-governmental agencies will evaluate the proper utilisation of funds in all government projects from now on, Gogoi, who returned from New Delhi yesterday after attending the chief ministers conference, told reporters here.        
	Such evaluation of government schemes and projects by outside agencies has already started in Jammu and Kashmir and Arunachal Pradesh, he said.        
	The chief ministers announcement comes amid allegations of misuse of government funds and diversion of central funds to militant outfits in the state.         
	The chief executive member of the North Cachar Hills Autonomous Council, Mohit Hojai, has been arrested on the basis of such charges.        
	Gogoi said the state government had approached the Centre to amend a few clauses of the Sixth Schedule, which would give more powers to Dispur over the autonomous councils in the state.         
	I am worried about the development in NC Hills where funds are being diverted to the militants but I am helpless since the state government hardly has the power to interfere, he said.        
	Contrary to Prime Minister Manmohan Singhs recent statement that the funds allocated for development activities in the Bodoland Territorial Council areas were not utilised properly, the chief minister said funds were being utilised in the BTC areas but there was scope for improvement.        
	Insurgency and lack of proper machinery and expertise have also posed hurdles for total utilisation of funds, he said.        
	Gogoi disclosed that the government would utilise a large chunk of funds allocated by the Centre in the education and agriculture sectors since these were areas where development was needed the most.        
	The chief minister, on the other hand, ruled out talks with the Dima Halam Daogah (Jewel), stating that unless the cadres of the outfit surrendered their arms and top leaders came forward for talks, there was no question of a dialogue.        
	We have received feelers from the outfit expressing willingness to talk but unless they surrender all their weapons and top leaders come forward, we will not hold any discussions with them, Gogoi said.                    
	He asserted that the government would never go soft on any militant outfit and operations would continue against all the outfits till they surrender their arms.         
	Gogoi even cited statistics, saying that more militants were killed during the regime of the Congress-led government than during the AGP governments tenure.        
	The chief minister said that he had informed the Centre about the threat posed to the state by Maoist rebels.         
	Our state faces a big threat from Maoist rebels in the future. The Adivasi National Liberation Army has already established links with the Maoists. Our state is also close to West Bengal, Nepal and Jharkhand where the Maoists are active, he added.

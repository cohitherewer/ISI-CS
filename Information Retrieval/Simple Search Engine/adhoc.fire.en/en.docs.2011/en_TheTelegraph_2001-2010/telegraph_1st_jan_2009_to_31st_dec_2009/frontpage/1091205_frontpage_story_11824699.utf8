  - Members show quirky side with individual concerns          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      Spare a thought for desi cow                                
	New Delhi, Dec. 4: Did you know Indias cows are feeling humiliated?        
	Maal desi, chitra videshi, aisa nahi hona chahiye (Product national, pictures foreign, this should not happen), said Arjun Ram Meghwal of the BJP in the Lok Sabha today.        
	Thanks to Meghwal we now know why they moan all the time  dairy packs containing their produce are embossed with pictures of phirang breeds.         
	The member from Bikaner demanded during Zero Hour that the Indian animals, which look equally beautiful and have good horns, should have their pictures printed on the packets. The government could do at least this much for desi dairy.        
	Agriculture minister Sharad Pawar wasnt available for comment. Dairy companies like Amul and Nestle could not be contacted either. But a source mooed that some industry officials may have been busy coaxing insulted cows to produce milk.        
	Youve heard them shout and youve seen them jostle but the key to how our MPs minds work lies in Zero Hour and the Private Members Bill.         
	Thirty-nine such bills were listed in todays business, reflecting their concerns from consumer to Constitution.        
	Rajan Sushant, also a BJP member, did not introduce a bill but that hardly detracted from the seriousness with which he demanded IIPs train model political leaders of the calibre of Ram, Krishna and Vikramaditya. IIP here doesnt stand for the index of industrial production but Indian institutes of politics, though he did not put that in so many words.         
	He argued that if IIMs could produce good managers and other institutes able bureaucrats  though there is some dispute over this  why could there not be one to turn out politicians of quality?        
	What his leader L.K. Advani thought of this couldnt be ascertained  Sushant, in fact, said the country did not have intelligent politicians. How can the country have Ram rajya if it does not have quality politicians, trained in institutes like the ashrams of the sages in the old ages, he added.        
	Had he been asked, HRD minister Kapil Sibal might have replied that this austerity year he didnt have the money to promise IIPs.         
	Meghwal, who was pained by the humiliation of Indian cows, is a particularly active member. He has moved a bill that seeks to fix domestic workers wages while another suggests making rainwater harvesting compulsory for every household.         
	The Biju Janata Dals Baijayant Pandas interests are varied: one bill is against unsolicited telephone calls, another seeks rehabilitation of Naxalite victims and a third wants legislative measures to promote a two-child norm.        
	These bills have little political affiliation unless youre devious enough to associate a BJP members concern for desi cows with the protection the party has traditionally offered to the animal.        
	At times, MPs come up with bills that can be embarrassing to their parties. Once RJD member Raghuvansh Prasad Singh introduced a bill seeking a national directory of the corrupt. A little later, the Manmohan Singh government faced Opposition ire for inducting tainted RJD leaders into the cabinet.         
	L. Rajagopal of the Congress has brought a bill that seeks to scrap the daily allowance entitlement of members who disrupt House proceedings and even terminate membership in extreme cases. All parties had opposed a similar proposal mooted by former Lok Sabha Speaker Somnath Chatterjee.         
	A large number of MPs regularly bring bills to amend the Constitution. Even on todays list, nine MPs brought Constitution amendment bills. Any bill seeking to amend the Constitution has to be examined by the Committee on Private Members Bills and Resolutions.         
	The bills brought by private members are selected through ballots. The selected bills are categorised under A and B to determine their importance and allot time for introduction and discussion.         
	Only 14 private members bills  nine introduced in the Lok Sabha and five in the Rajya Sabha  have been passed since 1952.

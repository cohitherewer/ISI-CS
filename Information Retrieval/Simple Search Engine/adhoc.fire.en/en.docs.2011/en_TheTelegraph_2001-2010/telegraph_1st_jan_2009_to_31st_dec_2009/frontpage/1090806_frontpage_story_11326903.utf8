                                                                                                           Street protest not Parliament duty
  - MPs cannot claim immunity for agitation outside House          JAYANTH JACOB                      Off duty: Samajwadi Party MP Jayaprada during a protest against loadshedding in Rampur. (File picture)                                
	New Delhi, Aug. 5: Next time MPs lead a street protest, they should bear in mind that their special status doesnt extend beyond the portals of Parliament.        
	The Rajya Sabha committee on privileges has made it clear that members cant claim the immunity they enjoy during House proceedings while leading or taking part in an agitation because such protests cannot be construed as parliamentary duty.        
	The observation is part of the committees 55th report, which followed an MPs complaint that Delhi police punched and kicked him after a march he led for Dalit Muslim reservation last August. In his petition, Ejaz Ali had requested the House chairman to take suitable action against the errant policemen so that privileges of member(s) of Parliament are not breached in future.        
	The committee, the highest body that decides issues of privileges in the upper House, said privileges were available to members for discharging their parliamentary duties without any let or hindrance.        
	But leading or taking part in a dharna or agitation or a protest march  a normal thing for MPs apart from being their moral duty to highlight the problems of the common man  cannot be construed as performing parliamentary duty.        
	In other words, no immunity the Constitution specifies such as freedom from court proceedings for anything said or votes cast in Parliament, or freedom from arrest or detention during a meeting of the House, or of a committee, and 40 days before and after it.        
	The committee is headed by Rajya Sabha deputy chairman K. Rahman Khan.        
	A parliamentary source said VIPs sometimes put the administration in an awkward situation. The source cited the recent visit of two Union ministers to Bengals Lalgarh despite prohibitory orders and said such visits make the administration and police overcautious because of the VIP status of the visitors.        
	An MP, however, referred to another observation by the committee to insist that ground rules on arresting a member of Parliament had not changed and taking an MP into custody, even if it is for a personal offence, needs the Speakers permission.        
	The report makes it clear that the police should show due deference in dealing with MPs taking part in rallies and protests, the MP said.        
	In its report, the committee said the police must exercise restraint and deal with agitating MPs with dignity and respect.        
	Of course, the member added, MPs should be aware that during street protests, they are not performing their parliamentary duties and, therefore, should not be behaving in a manner as if it is a parliamentary duty.         
	This is an observation of the committee about a particular case. This can be cited as a precedent in the future. But it doesnt alter the existing privileges of MPs in any manner, said another MP.        
	In his complaint, Ali, a Rajya Sabha MP from Bihar, had alleged that police became more violent after knowing his identity. He said they pounced upon him, punched him several times inside a police station, and kicked him in his right rib.        
	Ali said he was later taken to Ram Manohar Lohia hospital for treatment.        
	The committee, which included Arun Jaitley, Sitaram Yechury, S.S. Ahluwalia, R.K. Dhawan and Abhishek Manu Singhvi, went through the submission of Delhi police, the medical records at the hospital and also viewed a CD submitted by the police.        
	In its report, it noted that the agitation was quite aggressive and that there was no evidence of lathi-charge by the police on Ejaz Ali.        
	The committee took into account Delhi polices reply that they were well aware of the members identity and (that) he was personally escorted to the police station by the inspector, law and order.        
	The committee also noted that in the medico-legal case sheet of the hospital, the attending doctor had recorded that there was no fresh external injury on Alis body.

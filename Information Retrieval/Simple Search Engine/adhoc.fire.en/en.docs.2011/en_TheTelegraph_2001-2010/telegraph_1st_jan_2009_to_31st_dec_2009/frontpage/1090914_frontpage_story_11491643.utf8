The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Slanging match fells Serena
                                                                                                           Slanging match fells Serena
                            
	New York, Sept. 13: One point from defeat, one last roll of the dice left to try and enter the US Open final.        
	Serena Williams robbed herself of that chance yesterday, just as she robbed her opponent of a chance to savour victory. The American chose that knife-edge moment to come unhinged in a volley of profanity towards a line judge, earning a penalty point that brought a scintillating match to a bizarre end.        
	The woman who said in May Im drama, and I dont want to be drama had given Belgian Kim Clijsters  a wild card making a joyful return to Grand Slam tennis after over two years in retirement  a 6-4, 7-5 victory she could not even celebrate.        
	Serenas anger was provoked by a foot fault citation that gave Clijsters match point  such calls are rare, and almost unheard-of at such key stages in high-stake matches.        
	Tenniss original bad boy John McEnroe, now TV commentator, immediately questioned the call. Moments later, he was announcing all hell has broken loose.        
	Not since McEnroe was defaulted from the 1990 Australian Open  when he swore at the umpire, supervisor and referee  has a singles player suffered such a tainted exit from such a big game.        
	The penalty was awarded because Serena had earlier earned a warning for racquet abuse as Clijsters, 26, the mother of a toddler, frustrated her all night. Standing far back behind the baseline, the Belgian was stunned when she realised she had won.        
	I was so surprised and shocked to see Serena walking over to me, she said. Its unfortunate that a battle like that has to end like that. The normal feelings of winning werent quite there.        
	When Serena went over to shake her hand, it was Clijsters who said: Im sorry. Serena said: I was like, This isnt your fault.        
	Tennis veterans in Calcutta were divided on whether an Indian umpire would be brave enough to punish, say, Leander Paes in similar circumstances.        
	Serena was eerily composed after the match. She declined to repeat what she told the lineswoman, saying she had let it go.        
	She suggested that it could have been worse. I know you dont believe me, I used to be worse.        
	But Serena did have the last word. Asked if she would like to have done anything differently, she said: I think I didnt play aggressive enough tennis.

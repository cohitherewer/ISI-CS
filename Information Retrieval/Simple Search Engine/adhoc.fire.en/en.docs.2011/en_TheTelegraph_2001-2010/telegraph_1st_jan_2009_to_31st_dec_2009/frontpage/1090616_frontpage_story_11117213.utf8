The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Cup missed but not a chance to boo at Lords
                                                                                                           Cup missed but not a chance to boo at Lords
  - Noon blames Indians from England          AMIT ROY                            Indian supporters at Lords during the India versus England match on Sunday. (AFP)                                        
	London, June 15ss: Businessman Gulam Noon expressed disappointment tinged with anger at the behaviour of some Indian fans who booed the England team before Mahendra Singh Dhonis side was knocked out of the Twenty20 World Cup at Lords yesterday.        
	These were not Indians from India  there would have been very few of them  but Indsians from England, said Noon, who said he was sitting in a corporate box and also received a booting, though good-natured, from other Indians because I was supporting England.        
	Noon added: Winning and losing is part of the game but these are Indians born here, educated here, they have established their businesses here. It was very upsetting to hear them booing Paul Collingwood and the England players when they came out after their victory.        
	When the West Indies play England, the West Indian fans do not boo the England players, Noon, a fanatical supporter of the game, said.        
	He noted that both Kevin Pietersen and Ravi Bopara produced impressive performances and may have benefited from their exposure to the recent IPL in South Africa.        
	In the past, Indians fans, even when disappointed, have generally not booed England players. But with the advent of Twenty20, a new kind of supporter, with some similarity to his yob cousin in football, is being drawn to the game. He usually wears an India shirt, waves an Indian flag, becomes increasingly vocal and prepares for the game by imbibing generous quantities of what Australians call the amber liquid.         
	What happened was not in the spirit of the game, said Noon.        
	Collingwood told The Times, London, that being heckled as his side warmed up had spurred on his side. We got booed at the home of cricket by the India fans, which was a bit strange, so that gave us a bit of motivation, he said.        
	Those able to read would have been stung by the headline over the match report: Boos inspire England to dethrone champions India in World Twenty20.        
	By and large, England does not require its Indian-origin citizens to show loyalty to their country of adoption by supporting its cricket team during matches against India  though the Tory politician Norman Tebbit had made this the requirement of his Tebbit cricket test back in 1990.        
	A large proportion of Britains Asian population fail to pass the cricket test, he had observed. Which side do they cheer for? Its an interesting test. Are you still harking back to where you came from or where you are?        
	Although the game has moved on and England has been captained by Madras-born Nasser Hussain and now regularly selects cricketers of Asian origin from Monty Panesar to Bopara and Owais Shah in the national side, the nationalistic instincts of Indian supporters remain as deeply in grained as ever. Mumbai-born Noon is probably an exception.        
	The attacks unfolding in Australia are unlikely to be repeated in England but in the Daily Mail, Collingwood was quoted as saying: Before the game we were booed by some Indian fans and that hurt a few people, but it meant I didnt have to make any motivational speech before we went out.

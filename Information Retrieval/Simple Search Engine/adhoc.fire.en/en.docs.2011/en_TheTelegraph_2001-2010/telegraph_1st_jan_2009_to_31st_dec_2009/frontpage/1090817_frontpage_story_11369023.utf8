The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Give-and-take ensures desert ceasefire in BJP
                                                                                                           Give-and-take ensures desert ceasefire in BJP
  - Vasundhara issues conciliatory statement, Rajnath allows her time to resign and sends emissary           SANJAY K. JHA AND RAKHEE ROY TALUKDAR                                                      Caption      
	Aug. 16: A perilous confrontation between a state leader and the high command that could have torn the BJP apart was averted today with former Rajasthan chief minister Vasundhara Raje correctly reading the grim signals emanating from Delhi.        
	The partys central leadership now expects her to send in her resignation as leader of the Opposition in the Assembly in a few days. The BJPs highest decision-making body, the parliamentary board, met this afternoon originally to discuss Vasundharas defiance but took note of her latest statement that sent out a conciliatory message.        
	Party president Rajnath Singh said Vasundharas statement was very positive and the parliamentary board hoped she would obey the orders given by him. Asked what the orders were, Rajnath said he had asked her to resign.         
	The central leadership, too, decided not to precipitate a crisis after Vasundhara altered her posture. Rajnath said there was no deadline set for her resignation and did not announce her successor.         
	Instead of unilaterally electing her successor, Rajnath sent former Rajasthan state chief Om Mathur to hold talks with Vasundhara, which is being viewed as a compromise formula worked out to prevent a confrontation. Vasundhara, too, conveyed to Rajnath through Mathur that she would resign in a few days. The Vasundhara camp claimed in Jaipur that she might be given a say in choosing her successor.        
	Rajnaths main objective in calling the parliamentary board was to dispel the impression that his decision to remove Vasundhara did not have the partys backing.        
	Sources claimed from the very beginning that the core committee had approved the decision but some senior leaders fuelled speculation about divisions in the high command. Rajnath, who was not willing to back out as the decision had full RSS support, clinched the issue with the parliamentary boards formal approval.        
	The very decision to call the parliamentary board on the issue sent a clear signal to the Rajasthan unit that the central leadership was not yielding under pressure. The stern message had the desired effect: the MLAs who had rallied behind Vasundhara developed cold feet.         
	The meeting called by Vasundhara at Jaipur today drew barely half a dozen MLAs, the lukewarm response coming two days after the show of strength in Delhi when over 50 of them were present.         
	Perhaps reading the writing on the wall, Vasundhara today issued a statement reaffirming her commitment to the party. She said the BJP was like her mother and the idea of floating a separate party had not occurred to her. Vasundhara also asserted that she had never spoken a word against any senior leader and was ready to abide by the partys directives.         
	The statement set the stage for reconciliation, and now the central leadership hopes she would take the next step of relinquishing the office. This is a big relief for the BJP ahead of the Shimla chintan baithak where the leadership will review causes of the Lok Sabha election defeat and draw up future political strategies. The crisis-ridden party had received a shot in the arm on Friday night when RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat denied reports that he had asked L.K. Advani to quit as leader of Opposition in Parliament.        
	Although the RSS never accepts its political role and the charge of interference in BJPs organisational matters, Bhagwats categorical statement is expected to bolster Advanis moral authority at the crucial Shimla meet.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Poll in Maoist sights, IAF sends choppers 
                                                                                                           Poll in Maoist sights, IAF sends choppers 
          SUJAN DUTTA                                               
	New Delhi, April 15: The Indian Air Forces helicopter squadrons in central and eastern India have been alerted for internal security duties.         
	The IAF will be deployed for counter-Naxalite operations during the elections, Air Chief Marshal Fali Homi Major said here today.         
	Helicopters of the IAF were used to deploy troops and for evacuation of casualties both in Bihar and Orissa where Maoist rebels raided a Border Security Force camp and laid siege to the explosives depot of a National Aluminium Corporation mine over the last two days.         
	We have a role to play in such kind of conflict, Air Chief Marshal Major said. Whether it is in Jammu and Kashmir, in the Northeast or against the Naxalites. Yes, we are involved, he added.         
	In Bihar today, the IAF deployed at least one Mi-17 helicopter to reinforce the BSF company on duty that was attacked by the rebels and to evacuate an injured soldier.         
	In Orissa, the air force flew in reinforcements to Damanjodi near Asias largest bauxite mine about 600km from Bhubaneswar to foil a Maoist raid on the magazine of explosives on April 12.         
	This is a step short of using air power for offensive operations. But it is cutting a fine line on the central policy of not using the military in counter-Naxalite operations other than for training state police forces.         
	Indian armed forces have rarely used helicopter gunships to fire at rebels to quell insurgencies in internal security operations. The IAF is currently headed by a helicopter gunship pilot.         
	Look, whenever the MHA (ministry of home affairs) asks us, we are there to play our role, the air chief marshal said, explaining that his force was acting only in aid to the civilian authority.         
	The use of military force against Naxalites in Orissa, Bihar, Andhra Pradesh, Bengal or Jharkhand is vastly different from that in Jammu and Kashmir or the Northeast. In the Naxalite regions, the Armed Forces Special Powers Act is not in force and neither is a Unified Command of the civil and military authorities in place.         
	The armed forces monitor and observe Naxalite activity but have expressed no willingness or urge to be deployed in countering them. The armys central command has carried out studies on the Communist Party of India (Maoist) that has given a poll boycott call.

          OUR BUREAU                               
	Dibrugarh/Kokrajhar, Aug. 5: A top Bodo militant, nicknamed Gandhi, who was allegedly planning to blow up the Saraighat bridge in Guwahati, was killed by security forces in an encounter in Dhemaji late last night.         
	Bhim Boro, alias Gandhi, alias BK, a 37-year-old area commander of the Ranjan Daimary faction of the National Democratic Front of Boroland, had allegedly masterminded the blast in Sonitpur district last month in which an army colonel and his driver were killed.         
	Around 11.30 last night, a joint team of the police and 2 Bihar regiment, assisted by the Tezpur-based Military Intelligence Unit of the armys 4 Corps, closed in on Gandhi at Bakulbari and shot him.         
	An Italy-make pistol, two live rounds of ammunition, three fired cases, a grenade, a mobile phone and some incriminating documents, including extortion notes, were found on him.         
	Ironically, the killing came on the eve of a 12-hour bandh called by the NDFB faction to protest against the army operations, described by the outfit as fake encounters.        
	After disclosing details about the encounter, the police today also revealed that the Daimary faction was planning to blow up the double-decker Saraighat bridge before Independence Day.         
	Gandhi, who trained in Afghanistan, was the brain behind the plot, the police said.         
	Gandhis elimination is a big relief for the security forces as well as for the common people here. Daimary had entrusted a seven-member group from the NDFBs 3rd battalion to consolidate the outfits position in Dhemaji, Lakhimpur and some parts of Arunachal Pradesh like East and West Siang districts. Gandhi was made the area commander of these areas, Dhemaji superintendent of police Satyaraj Hazarika said.         
	Information gathered from various sources and agencies revealed that Daimary had instructed his men to blow up the Saraighat bridge and Gandhi was specifically making plans for this. Their plan was to buy an oil tanker and build an additional chamber in it to be filled with RDX. One of the cadres would drive the vehicle to the bridge and then blow it up, Hazarika said.         
	The plan was taking shape in Dhemaji to avoid the glare of security forces and intelligence agencies.        
	Besides, such old tankers are available at a much cheaper price in the areas bordering Assam and Arunachal Pradesh.         
	Gandhi, who was on the hit list of the security forces for quite some time now, had also triggered the blast which killed an army colonel along with his driver at Bhalukpung some days back.         
	The 12-hour Assam bandh called by the NDFB faction, crippled the four BTC districts of Kokrajhar, Chirang, Baksa and Udalguri.         
	The self-styled sergeant major of the outfit, B. Birbai, accused security personnel of killing civilians in the name of operations against the NDFB and said 75 per cent of the so-called encounters were fake and fabricated.

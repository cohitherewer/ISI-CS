  - Nafisa to Shashi, glam set finds itself on ticklish terrain           TAPAS CHAKRABORTY                                                    Nafisa Ali and Amar Singh during a news conference in Lucknow. (PTI)      
	Lucknow, April 5: Gliding down from their sanitised world into the election cauldron, glamour candidates are getting scalded.        
	Former Congress candidate Nafisa Ali, fielded by the Samajwadi Party from Lucknow today in a move typical of the rough and tumble of poll politics, seemed short on homework.        
	She tore into Kalyan Singh over the Babri demolition only to be reminded that the then BJP chief minister was now a Samajwadi ally. She then forgot to add ji to the names of Atal Bihari Vajpayee and her party chief Mulayam Singh Yadav in a city renowned for tehzeeb (good manners).        
	In faraway Thiruvananthapuram, Congress candidate and former UN official Shashi Tharoor left a TV debate as the exchanges grew more and more unlike a diplomatic tussle.        
	At the Samajwadis Lucknow briefing, Amar Singh was chuckling at the thought of how embarrassed the Congress would be to see Nafisa, known to be close to Sonia Gandhi, by his side when the smile was wiped off his lips.        
	Actress-turned-social activist Nafisa had been plucked out of nowhere and fielded against Mamata Banerjee by the Congress in 2004 only to lose by 333,000 votes.         
	She had again been ready to play fodder -- this time against the BJPs Lalji Tandon -- when Sanjay Dutt, denied a chance to contest by the Supreme Court, approached her.        
	Nafisa had begun well today, saying her ties with the Congress were history.        
	I remember what Sajjan Kumar and Jagdish Tytler had done to the Sikhs, she said, referring to the 1984 killings as an old wound  one that, however, had not stopped her from accepting the 2004 nomination.        
	Then she moved on to 1992 and Kalyan.        
	Kalyan Singh played soft with the communal forces, she said, to be immediately asked how she would feel if Kalyan now came to campaign for her.        
	Amar almost jumped. He quickly began whispering to her. Umm, he (Kalyan) has a different identity now Nafisa continued valiantly, he needs a second chance.        
	So, would she give Narendra Modi, a man she had lambasted to earn the Congress ticket in 2004, a second chance too? Yes, if he apologies brings justice to the riot victims.        
	Amar, though, needed to do more whispering. Nafisa had just referred to Vajpayee, a five-time winner from Lucknow, and asked the voters to elect a secular candidate this time, and to Mulayam, who she said didnt need to prove his secular credentials. She quickly corrected herself by adding the mandatory ji in the very next sentence.        
	Nafisa had earlier approached the Congress for the Lucknow ticket, claimed Parvez Hashmi, a Congress secretary, but we were exploring the possibility of a local candidate. He added: Whether to field a candidate against Nafisa Ali has not been decided yet.        
	Amar said snatching Nafisa was tit for tat. The Congress had earlier taken SP leaders like Beni Prasad Verma, Raj Babbar, Salim Sherwani without hesitation; we have taken Nafisaji, who is close to Sonia Gandhi (and) was first approached by the Congress.        
	He claimed both parties had earlier approached Shabana Azmi but she had preferred to stay in the Rajya Sabha.        
	Nafisa, former student of La Martiniere in Calcutta, showcased her secular roots saying her mother was a Roman Catholic, her father a Muslim, and her husband a Sikh. I have also studied the Vedanta.        
	Later in the evening, she told a TV channel her first remarks on Kaylan werent a faux pas  she was merely trying to highlight the transformation in the man.              
	Tharoor ire        
	In the one-hour TV show, Porkalam (Battlefield), last night, Tharoor was reminded that he had written against Sonia as possible Prime Minister in 1991.        
	The Congress candidate from Thiruvananthapuram replied he had only reported various peoples opinion and mentioned Sonias relative inexperience then.         
	Sonia Gandhi has gained a lot of experience. I strongly believe only the Congress, led by her, can install a stable government.        
	A second question related to Tharoors syndicated column, Indias Israel envy, in several newspapers that supposedly justified Israeli atrocities in Gaza.         
	Thanks for mentioning my piece, Tharoor said, but you have not read it. Read it fully and come back.        
	Next question: wasnt he a high command nominee (and so had little in common with the ordinary Congress worker)?        
	Channel anchor P.G. Suresh Kumar said Tharoors walkout was unfortunate but added: I dont think he walked out because of the questions.        
	He said Congress workers had protested CPI candidate P. Ramachandran Nairs comments against the Congress MP from the constituency, Pannian Ravindran, and Tharoor had left in the commotion.        
	We rushed to him and asked him to stay as the programme would have been over in 20 minutes. But he refused.        
	With inputs from John Mary in Thiruvananthpuram

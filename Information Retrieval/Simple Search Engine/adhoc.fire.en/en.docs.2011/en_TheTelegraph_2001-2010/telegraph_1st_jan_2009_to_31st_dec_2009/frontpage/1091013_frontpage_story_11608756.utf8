          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Oct. 12: The Centre will step up its offensive against Maoists in November after positioning troops simultaneously with moves to win the support of sections of the local population for the drive.        
	Last week, home secretary G.K. Pillai had said the offensive would cover six districts in two or three of four states (Jharkhand, Chhattisgarh, Orissa and Maharashtra) to begin with.         
	Today, however, home ministry sources said the offensive in its many shades would cover as many as 20 states and target overground workers of the Maoists as well.        
	A top Union home ministry official said the Jharkhand government had been asked to withdraw more than 1 lakh cases against tribals. The tribals had been charged with infringing on government forests, cutting wood illegally and using vested land as pasture.         
	The cases are being withdrawn to give relief to the tribals and in the hope that they will assist government forces against the Maoists in Jharkhands countryside.        
	Jharkhand is currently under central rule that has been extended till December after which elections are likely. Across the tribal belt from Jharkhand through Orissa, Chhattisgarh, northern Andhra Pradesh and parts of Maharashtra and even in Gujarats Dangs, the Congress has been steadily losing support over the years.        
	A home ministry source said the Jharkhand governor had recommended closure of the cases against the tribals in his state because most of the charges were petty but the tribals were feeling harassed.        
	Central and state forces in Maoist-influenced areas, such as in Bengals Lalgarh, have been hamstrung by the lack of intelligence because of the lack of local support. By giving relief to the tribals and showing a more benevolent administration, the home ministry expects to create some favourable ground as the offensive is stepped up.        
	The step-up in the coordinated offensive is likely in November, about two weeks after the Assembly elections in three states tomorrow. The electoral process is expected to be completed by October 22, after which paramilitary forces can be redeployed.         
	Home ministry officials and minister P. Chidambaram have discussed the offensive with the chief ministers, including Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee, of the affected states jointly and separately to ensure the co-ordination that the forces require, particularly in inter-state boundary regions.        
	The official said around 40,000 paramilitary troops had been deployed and they would be reinforced by more battalions. Home secretary Pillai had said that convoys of trucks carrying relief and development material would follow once civil administration is restored in each zone.        
	The offensive is expected to bring civil administration to about 2.5 million people. The home ministry has assessed that it will take around 18 months for the results to show.

          RAJ KUMAR                              
	Sisai, Dec.12: Known for its talent pool of national level kabaddi and kho-kho players, Bargaon village showed true sporting spirit today, creating a festive atmosphere on polling day with men and women, some accompanied by children, thronging booths to cast their votes.        
	 About 50 km from the state capital, this village of around 5,000 people in Sisai constituency in Gumla district, lived up to its reputation of being responsible citizens by encouraging its residents to honour their commitment to democracy as they always do in sport.        
	Over the years, Bargaon has sent 30 of its boys to represent the state in kho-kho and kabaddi. Yet, like many of Jharkhands villages, it has its share of problems not entirely unfamiliar  which it has learnt to live with.         
	Surrounded by three rivers, Bargaon has no water. Only 5km away from a national highway, electricity hasnt reached its surrounding areas.        
	But ask Shivlal Sahu, who took part in the 2000 kho-kho and kabaddi nationals, about what he expects from his MLA, and he mentions nothing of the hardships. All he wants is for the state to pay more attention to sports people.         
	Athletics is the mother of sport but athletes in the state are most neglected. The new government should pay some attention to them, he said, accompanied by Heerlal Baitha and Udit Kumar, both national players of kho-kho and kabaddi, having represented the state in 2005 and 2008 respectively. Ten other junior national players, who had also come with them, had gone inside the booth to cast their vote.         
	By 11am, 21.48 per cent (382 of 1,778) voters had cast their votes at the two booths of the village. At nearby Roshanpur, the turnout was less than 10 per cent (54 of 609), while at Bartoli, 2km away, the turnout was 15 per cent (106 of 737).                                                        
	By the end of the day, voting had picked up considerably. If overall figures for Sisai was 56 per cent, Bargaon and its neighbouring villages had surely played their part.         
	Near the two booths, village folk had set up tea stalls, as if the Bargaon Middle School was hosting a fair. Partymen of various allegiances jostled for space, while children screamed in excitement as they spotted choppers hovering above.

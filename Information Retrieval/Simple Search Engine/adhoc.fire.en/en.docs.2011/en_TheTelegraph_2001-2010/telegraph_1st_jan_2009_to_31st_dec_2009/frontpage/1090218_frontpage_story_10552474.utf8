The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Idol girl hopes to break barriers
                                                                                                           Idol girl hopes to break barriers
  - Sourabhee seeks support from region          OUR BUREAU                                          
	Guwahati/Agartala, Feb. 17: Tripura girl Sourabhee Debbarma who has earned the sobriquet of rock star, thanks to her blazing performances on the TV reality show Indian Idol 4, today appealed to the region to help her win the title.         
	In Guwahati to garner support from her own people, the Indian Idol 4 finalist did not forget to seek blessings from Bhupen Hazarika for the final musical showdown on March 1.        
	Bhupenda is my idol. In one of my school functions, I danced to the tune of Hazarikas famous song Oh ganga tum, ganga tum, ganga tum, oh ganga, ganga behti ho kyun? His blessings are very important for me. The people should vote for me not only because I am good, but also because it will be a show of unity among the states of the Northeast, Sourabhee said this evening.         
	Personal gain is certainly not the only reason she is aiming for the title.        
	If she wins the reality show, it will highlight the positive aspects of the Northeast, which has been in the headlines for all the wrong reasons in the recent years, she said. If the outsiders are thinking that the region is all about gun shots and bloodshed, they must be proved wrong through this kind of reality show, said the 22-year-old aspiring Indian Idol, sitting pretty in a brown top and slate jeans.        
	Sourabhee termed her journey to Mumbai as the turning point of her life. From a simple and shy girl, I had to transform myself into a sensational diva. It was tough, but I had faith in God. It is now up to the people to recognise my struggle, she said.         
	Her visit to Guwahati came a day after she took her hometown, Agartala, by storm and seemed to have cemented the states fractured ethnic mosaic, as thousands of Bengalis and tribals gathered at Stable ground field to root for her on Monday.        
	Sourabhee left for Pune three years ago to obtain a Bachelor of Business Administration (BBA) degree, with a passion for music and zest for study.         
	She had no formal initiation into music under a teacher but she loved music from childhood and is gifted with a good voice. I did not allow her to indulge in her favourite pastime of singing during her schooldays though, said Sourabhees father Sunil Debbarma, a zonal development officer in the Autonomous District Council.

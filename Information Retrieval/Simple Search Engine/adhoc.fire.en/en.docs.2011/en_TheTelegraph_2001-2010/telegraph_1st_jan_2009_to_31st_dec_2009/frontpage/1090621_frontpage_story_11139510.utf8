  - Satra Mahasabha links conspiracy to violence in the district           OUR BUREAU                                           
	Silchar/Guwahati, June 20: North Cachar Hills burnt again as unidentified persons torched 21 huts at Delon Watling, a remote Dimasa-inhabited village under Maibong subdivision in the district, this afternoon.         
	The Asom Satra Mahasabha dubbed the spurt in ethnic violence in the district as a part of the conspiracy to include some areas of the district in the NSCN (Isak-Muivah)s plan for a Greater Nagalim.         
	There was no casualty as the huts were abandoned a month ago in the wake of a spurt in ethnic violence between the Dimasas and the Zeme Nagas.        
	Sources said a group of 11 youths, three of whose faces were draped in black, raided the village situated about 55km from the district headquarters town of Haflong and burnt 21 of the 25 huts there this morning. The huts were made of bamboo, wood and corrugated tin sheets.         
	They said the swoop on the village lasted for an hour with the attackers chasing the Dimasa youths who were guarding the huts, across the hills. The youths ran helter-skelter and spread themselves across the dense jungles nearby to give the marauding gang a slip. However, one of among them, Debajit Batari, went missing after the raid.        
	The sources said the incident might have been an act of revenge for the killing of 15 Zeme Nagas by alleged Dimasa gunmen on Tuesday at Michiduiiram village, 22km from Haflong.         
	A team of the Mahasabha that toured the trouble-torn district on Thursday for an on-the-spot study of the situation tried to establish the conspiracy angle by pointing out in Guwahati today that the attacks have primarily taken place in areas included in the Greater Nagalim plan of the NSCN-IM.         
	Over 50 people have died and thousands rendered homeless in the recent ethnic conflicts in NC Hills.         
	Janardhan Deba Goswami, the satradhikar of Kamalabari Satra in Majuli, said, Some agents of a religious sect from our neighbouring state along with an extremist organisation are continuously trying to spread a feeling of separation in the hills district.                                             
	Goswami, the Majuli unit president of the Mahasabha, said the Dimasas and Zeme Nagas have peacefully co-existed in the district for over 500 years.         
	Bhaba Goswami, the president of Asom Satra Mahasabha, said the Mahasabha had been contemplating several measures to cement the age-old ties between the two ethnic communities in the hill district.         
	Since NC Hills is one of the most backward districts in the state, we are thinking of opening schools in interior areas, he added.         
	He said the Mahasabha would also adopt a few children who had lost their parents in the recent conflicts in the district. We have already adopted one such child whose mother was killed. We will sponsor his studies in the future, he added.         
	Goswami said the government had not taken adequate relief measures to rehabilitate the affected people in the district. We have witnessed about 700 people staying in one small relief camp where food has also not been provided adequately, he alleged.         
	He said lack of development in the district was one of the reasons for insurgency. There are no roads, bridges and schools in the interior areas.         
	While appealing to the authorities to utilise the funds meant for the district in a proper way, Goswami said those responsible for misusing development funds should be punished.         
	Bhadrakanta Goswami, the satradhikar of Jokai Satra in Sivasagar district, who was also present, appealed to all organisations in the state to do the needful to thwart the evil designs of vested interests to divide the ethnic communities of the state.

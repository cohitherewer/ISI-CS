The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Expel Durga cry grows louder
                                                                                                           Expel Durga cry grows louder
          SHAHNAWAZ AKHTAR                              
	Giridih, April 9: The fissures within the JMM are showing.        
	Senior leaders have started speaking out against their leader Shibu Sorens eldest son, Durga, for having pulled off a stunt that has resulted in a huge setback to the party and its seat-sharing deal with the Congress.        
	Talking to The Telegraph, JMM chief whip in Parliament and Giridih MP Teklal Mahto said Durga, who has filed his nomination from Godda, had taken a very wrong step. An FIR should be lodged against Durga and he should be dismissed. As soon as Guruji (Shibu Soren) gets well, we will raise a demand, said Mahto        
	The sitting MP from Giridih, Mahto is likely to feel the direct impact of Durgas move. The JMM veterans 2.5-lakh minority vote bank in this district is at stake.        
	It is wrong to snatch away the single seat given to a minority candidate (in seat-sharing deal between Congress and JMM). It is a kind of conspiracy, he said.        
	Mahto claimed that minority voters across Jharkhand were unhappy with the party because of Durga.         
	It is quite natural. They have always backed us and are now feeling cheated. The JMMs chief whip in state Assembly and Gandey MLA Salkhan Soren echoed Mahtos views. Durga has disobeyed the party. Strict action should be taken against him, he said. Salkhan claimed he had no idea what Soren junior was up to. He may be outside Jharkhand, the MLA, who has won four times on a JMM ticket, said.        
	Senior JMM leaders Hemlal Murmu, Sudhir Mahto and Haji Hussain Ansari have decided to campaign for Congress nominee Furkan Ansari, the official JMM-Congress candidate for Godda, on April 11. We are trying our best to persuade Durga Soren to step down. We cannot let one person ruin the partys image. Durgas move will have an impact on the prospects of other JMM candidates, said Sudhir Mahto. Several other JMM leaders are likely to campaign for Ansari.        
	Meanwhile, minority organisations in the state today likened the JMM with the BJP and urged community members not to vote for JMM candidates in any of the 14 seats.        
	Shibu Soren has not been able to keep his flock together. He should resign from the JMM chiefs post. Durgas act has shown that the party is anti-Muslim. Like the BJP, the JMM, too, will face the consequences in this state. This election will be the last nail in the JMMs coffin, said Jharkhand Momin Society member Shahnawaz Ansari at a news meet here. Mahmood Ali Khan of the Muslim Youth Committee alleged that the JMM, led by Soren, had always worked against the minorities.         
	From the Chirudih massacre to pitting candidate against Nadira Begam in the Ramgarh by-election and himself contesting against Sarfraz Ahmad in the Rajya Sabha election  Soren has betrayed the Muslims every time, he said.

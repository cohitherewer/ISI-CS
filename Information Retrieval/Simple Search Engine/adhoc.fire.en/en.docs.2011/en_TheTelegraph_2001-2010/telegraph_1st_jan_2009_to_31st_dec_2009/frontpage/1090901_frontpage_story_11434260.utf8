	New Delhi, Aug. 31: The one-day-old ceasefire in the BJP ended today when a veteran parliamentarian of Sangh stock released to the press a letter he had written to the party chief demanding that Jaswant Singh be taken back.        
	The decision (to expel him) was done in haste, Rajya Sabha MP Pyarelal Khandelwal told The Telegraph after releasing his August 29 letter to Rajnath Singh, copies of which were also sent to Atal Bihari Vajpayee, L.K. Advani, Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh chief Mohan Bhagwat and Jaswant.        
	Expulsion should be the last resort and not the first action. In (Arun) Shouries case, the leaders showed patience and allowed him to clarify his stand. They should have done it with Jaswant Singh too, the former RSS pracharak (whole-timer) added.        
	The disclosure came on a day former RSS chief K.S. Sudarshan called on Advani with Sangh point man and BJP organising secretary Ramlal in tow.        
	BJP sources said the breakfast visit was part of a move to mollify the leader, who is under pressure to step down as leader of Opposition in the Lok Sabha. The Sangh, they added, was also keen that Advanis legacy and contributions shouldnt be dismissed as a footnote in the parivars history.        
	BJP and RSS sources said if the Advani chapter in the BJPs rise and rise was overshadowed by his alleged omissions and commissions as home minister, they would be held guilty of misrepresenting their own history for short-sighted political reasons. Khandelwal said neither Rajnath nor Bhagwat had touched base with him so far. Asked how he would follow up on his missive, he said: Lets see.        
	BJP spokesperson Ravi Shankar Prasad was, however, clear that Jaswant wasnt going to return. There is no question of it happening, he said.        
	But sources said Khandelwals letter, which ended the RSS-prompted ceasefire in the BJP until the autumn polls in several states, might queer the partys efforts to remove Jaswant as chairman of the prestigious parliamentary Public Accounts Committee.        
	The morning also saw BJP deputy leader in the Lok Sabha Sushma Swaraj and her House of elders counterpart S.S. Ahluwalia calling on the expelled leader. Neither was available for comment, but a senior leader said they were told off when they tried to persuade Jaswant to resign honourably from the chairmans post and not open another front.        
	Some leaders, sources said, feel that since the post is for just a year, the party should let the Darjeeling MP keep it rather than make a prestige issue of it.        
	Parliamentary rules make it tough for any party to replace a person occupying the post  which, by convention, goes to the main Opposition party  unless he or she voluntarily steps down.        
	If the BJP cannot coax a resignation out of Jaswant, its only option is to ask the Speaker, who has already notified Jaswants chairmanship, to cancel his chairmanship and appoint one of its two other nominees on the panel, Gopinath Munde or Yashwant Sinha. But Speaker Meira Kumar, it is believed, is not inclined to act whimsically.        
	More speculation on Jaswant was set off when Advani called on the Speaker this afternoon. But BJP sources said the visit had nothing to do with the issue and it was just a courtesy call to have a cup of tea with the Speaker.

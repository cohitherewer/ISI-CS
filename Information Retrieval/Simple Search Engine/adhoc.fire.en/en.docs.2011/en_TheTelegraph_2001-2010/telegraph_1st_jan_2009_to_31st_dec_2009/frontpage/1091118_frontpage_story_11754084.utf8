          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Guwahati, Nov. 17: The National Investigation Agency probing the alleged diversion of funds of the North Cachar Hills Autonomous Council to the Dima Halam Daogah (J) today chargesheeted former chief of the council, Mohit Hojai, and 13 others, including the outfits chief Jewel Gorlosa and commander-in-chief Niranjan Hojai.        
	The NIA also prayed before the court to summon Hojai, who is lodged in a designated camp after surrendering on October 2 along with other cadres of the outfit.        
	A source in the NIA said the court could, if it wanted, remand Niranjan Hojai in custody.        
	The investigation agency filed the chargesheet in the special court of the NIA designated judge, Tarun Phukan, this afternoon.        
	This is the first chargesheet to be filed by the NIA. The agency has the mandate of investigating terror cases across the country without permission from state governments.        
	Of the 14 accused in the North Cachar Hills Council funds diversion case, the NIA source said, 11 were in jail while two others were out on bail. Niranjan Hojai was at a designated camp in North Cachar Hills.        
	The accused have been charged under Sections 120 (B), 121, 121 (A) of the Indian Penal Code and Sections 16, 17, 18, 19, 20 of Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act of 1967.        
	Those accused also include Vanlal Chana alias Vantea, a Mizo arms dealer.         
	Two other Mizo gunrunners, Malchou Kimi, a woman, and George Langthang, have also been chargesheeted.        
	Mohit Hojai had taken away council funds which eventually reached the DHD (J) through middlemen, a source said.         
	We have collected substantial evidence against all the accused and thereafter filed the chargesheet today, the source said.        
	The case of diversion of North Cachar Hills Council funds came to light following the arrest of two DHD (J) linkmen with Rs 1 crore in cash. They told the police that the money was given to them by Hojai for securing an arms deal for the outfit. The police said the duo were on their way to Mizoram to seal the deal when they were arrested.        
	R.H. Khan, an official of the council also arrested with Mohit Hojai, is also one of the accused.        
	The source said several of the accused were arrested from Calcutta. They were involved in the monetary transactions and channelised the funds to the DHD (J) besides facilitating purchase of weapons, the source said.         
	Those arrested from Calcutta were Jayanta Kumar Ghosh, Sandip Kumar Ghosh and Debasish Kumar Bhattacharjee.        
	Gorlosa, the outfits chief, was arrested from Bangalore along with the deputy commander-in-chief Partha Warisa and Samir Ahmed earlier this year. Partha and Samir have also been chargesheeted.

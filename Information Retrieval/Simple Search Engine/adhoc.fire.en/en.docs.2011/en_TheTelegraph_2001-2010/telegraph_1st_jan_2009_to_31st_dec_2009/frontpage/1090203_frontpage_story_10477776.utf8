The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Pak gunmen kidnap American
                                                                                                           Pak gunmen kidnap American
          NASIR JAFFRY AND AGENCIES                             Solecki: Dastardly act				                                 
	Islamabad, Feb. 2: Gunmen kidnapped an American UN worker and killed his driver in southwestern Pakistan today, underscoring the security threat in a country wracked by al Qaida violence.        
	John Solecki, head of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) office in the southwestern city of Quetta, was on his way to his office when gunmen intercepted his vehicle and opened fire, killing his driver. We strongly condemn this attack on humanitarian workers in Pakistan who have been doing their utmost to deliver their humanitarian mission, the UN said.        
	This was the first high-profile case of kidnapping in Quetta where eight people, including four policemen, were killed in sectarian violence last month.         
	Pakistans foreign ministry called the abduction a dastardly terrorist act, but it was not clear who seized Solecki.        
	Quetta is the capital of Baluchistan province, which partly borders Afghanistan. The dusty city is believed to be a possible hiding place for Mullah Omar and other Taliban leaders, who are thought to have fled Afghanistan after the US invasion in 2001.        
	Southwestern Pakistan is also the scene of a low-level insurgency driven by nationalist groups wanting more autonomy for Baluchistan province. But, unlike Taliban and al Qaida militants who control pockets of the northwest, the Baluch groups are not known to target foreigners. Police said they could not recall another foreigner being kidnapped in Quetta.        
	Senior police official Khalid Masood said Solecki was an American who had worked in Quetta for more than two years. The UN confirmed Solecki had been kidnapped, but would not specify where he was from.         
	Authorities sealed exit routes from the city, said Wazir Khan Nasir, another officer. Police in the border town of Chaman said they were checking vehicles to prevent the kidnappers from whisking the captive to Afghanistan.        
	US embassy spokesman Lou Fintor said American officials were looking into the reports. It was not immediately clear what impact the abduction would have on UN work in Pakistan, if any. The bombing of Islamabads Marriott hotel in September prompted new UN rules prohibiting expatriate staff in Pakistan from living with their children in parts of the country.

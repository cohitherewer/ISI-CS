          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Mumbai, Dec. 29: A young researcher from Bengal was among two killed in a fire that broke out today in a chemistry lab at the Bhabha Atomic Research Centre (Barc) in Trombay.        
	The lab is located a kilometre from nuclear reactors but officials said there was no danger of radioactivity.        
	The two victims have been identified as Partha Bag and Umang Singh, both in their twenties.         
	Additional commissioner of police Ritesh Kumar said Partha was from Narayanpur village in South 24-Parganas Namkhana, around 65km from Calcutta. Singh was from to Mumbai.        
	Sources said both were pursuing their PhD in the laboratory of Dr Indira Priyadarshini, a senior scientist in the chemistry division of Barc.         
	According to Narayanpur gram pradhan Chandramohan Paaik, Bag, 25, studied in a local school before moving to Bangalore to pursue engineering. Partha was an excellent student. His father Debaprasad Bag runs an ice factory in Narayanpur. Parthas younger sister is pursuing graduation from a Calcutta college, Paaik said.        
	Parthas family is expected to leave for Mumbai tomorrow.        
	The fire broke out at 12.05pm in the chemistry lab on the third floor of the modular lab. There was a loud bang after which smoke billowed out of the chemistry lab and filled the corridor, Barc director and Atomic Energy Commission chairman Sreekumar Banerjee told PTI.        
	The modular lab in the high-security Barc complex in north-eastern Mumbai does not carry out research involving radioactive material, officials said.        
	No reactor, radioactivity or radiation is involved in the accident, said S.K. Malhotra, head of the public awareness division of the department of atomic energy.        
	The laboratory had a few analytical instruments. The Barc fire brigade arrived immediately and brought the fire under control in 45 minutes. The bodies were charred beyond recognition and were discovered by firefighters on entering the laboratory, Malhotra added.        
	The bodies were identified on the basis of identity cards found on them.        
	Malhotra said Barc had ordered an investigation into the cause of the fire. Trombay police are also investigating the case separately.         
	The casualty could have been higher as seven researchers usually work in the chemistry lab, but only the two were present when the fire broke out.         
	This was the second fire in the lab in the past 50 years but there was no casualty in the earlier instance.         
	Of late, Indias nuclear establishment has found itself at the centre of controversies. Last month, around 45 to 50 employees of the Kaiga nuclear power plant in Karnataka were treated for increased levels of tritium after they drank spiked water from a cooler.

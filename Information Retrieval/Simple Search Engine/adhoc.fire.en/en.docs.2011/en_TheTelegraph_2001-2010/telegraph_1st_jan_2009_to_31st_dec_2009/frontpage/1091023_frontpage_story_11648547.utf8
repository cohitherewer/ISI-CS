The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | 2.5 out of 3, Congresss real victory lies in BJPs defeat
                                                                                                           2.5 out of 3, Congresss real victory lies in BJPs defeat
          SANKARSHAN THAKUR                                               
	New Delhi, Oct. 22: The Congress has made a clean sweep of the Assembly polls but the fine print of the results is a little more muddled than a 3-0 scorecard would suggest.        
	The hat-trick in Maharashtra was partly powered by Raj Thackerays heist on the BJP-Sena vote.        
	In Haryana, the party was halted short of a majority by Om Prakash Chautalas startling lone surge against the run of play.        
	His Indian National Lok Dal (INLD) alliance bagged 32 seats  the Congress peaked six short of the magic figure at 40  and pasted a hollow ring on incumbent Bhupinder Singh Hoodas smug pre-poll claims of a resounding return.        
	Hoodas assertions on creating history by securing the first-ever return of a ruling party in Haryana were at best tainted  the Congress may yet retain power in the state managing outside help, but Hooda has failed to deliver a clear majority.        
	Hooda will have to outflank the wily and newly buoyed Chautala, who, too, has staked claim and is energetically wooing support, including from estranged former ally BJP.        
	Arunachal Pradesh was, of course, an unprecedented sweep, but the real solace for Sonia Gandhis troops probably lies not in the defence of their forts but in the drubbing of their chief adversary, the BJP.        
	At the national level, these results will play out as renewed, if not overwhelming, endorsement of the UPA, and as another marker of the BJPs unbroken slide since the 2004 general election. Elated that the party had retained its sway, Congress leaders showed little patience with the nitty-gritty of the tough numbers in Haryana, maintaining that the results had proved the momentum of the public mood was with them.        
	The victory in Maharashtra is emphatic, said spokesperson Manish Tiwari. In Haryana, we have fallen short but our claim is strong. Remember, no ruling party has ever been returned in Haryana.        
	Typical to the Congress house-style, todays successes quickly became paving stones for heir-apparent Rahul Gandhis sure but steady progress to the centre stage. Party workers flagged his contribution, especially for infusing new energy.        
	A late-evening party release put a fine point on Rahuls role, drawing attention to the fact that the Congress had won nine of the eleven seats where the young general secretary campaigned.        
	BJP spokespersons, on the other hand, swung from the ridiculous to the realistic in trying to explain away another loss  Mukhtar Naqvi leapt to blame electronic voting machines, Ravi Shankar Prasad ascribed defeat almost entirely to Raj Thackeray.        
	But there was no overt attribution to issues that have dogged the party for months now  leadership and direction. Some BJP leaders had been hoping, well against their own hopes, that Maharashtra would deliver rejuvenation.        
	Now that Maharashtra has passed them by, delivering a punch rather than propulsion, the urgency on resolving internal tangles will intensify. Hard questions will be asked, especially by the RSS, or those seen as representing the Nagpur bosses.        
	We have gone through a phase of very public turmoil and done little about it, said a party MP. Some people were hoping a good result in Maharashtra will swing things around, that has not happened and now real issues will have to be faced.         
	The BJPs leading light, L.K. Advani, is under notice from the RSS to step down as leader of Opposition; Rajnath Singhs term as president expires in December; Vasundhara Raje Scindia continues in open defiance of the high commands quit diktat; several party figures have demanded corrections that vary from an RSS takeover to a comprehensive top-down overhaul.        
	One leader said today: We have been burying our heads in the sand hoping that the crisis will blow away, but that will not do anymore, the leadership will have to confront the personality and organisational crises it faces.

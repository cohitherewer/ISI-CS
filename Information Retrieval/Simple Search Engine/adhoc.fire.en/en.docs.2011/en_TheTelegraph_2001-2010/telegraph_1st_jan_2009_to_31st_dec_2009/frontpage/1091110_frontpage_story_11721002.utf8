          OUR BUREAU                            BV Venkatesh (in torn clothes) and his colleagues protest outside Karnataka High Court the alleged assault on the journalist by lawyers. (AP)                                  
	Bangalore/Chennai, Nov. 9: Advocates in Karnataka High Court today compelled Chief Justice P.D. Dinakaran to abandon a hearing and leave and locked in two judges who continued to sit in their court rooms.         
	The noisy scenes began as Justice Dinakaran sat for a hearing in the morning, triggering a boycott by the Advocates Association of Bangalore.         
	The association, a forum of some 14,000 advocates, had, on November 4, passed a resolution to abstain from court proceedings if the chief justice, against whom an allegation of amassing large tracts of land has been made, attended court on Monday.        
	The charge was levelled by a forum of lawyers from the Supreme Court and in Chennai who had asked for an inquiry by an apex court collegium approving Justice Dinakarans promotion. Two weeks ago, the collegium had decided to keep his elevation to the Supreme Court on hold.         
	As the protests by the lawyers began today, Justice Dinakaran left the court hall, as did many of the judges on a request by the advocates.         
	However, the boycott turned unruly at the court room of Justice V. Gopala Gowda and Justice B.V. Nagarathna when advocates locked them up inside, apparently when they continued to sit through proceedings.        
	All the judges rose after the advocates requested, said K.N. Putte Gowda, president of the association, who claimed the boycott was 100 per cent across all lower courts and tribunals in Bangalore and also other districts of Karnataka.         
	Putte Gowda, however, lamented the locking up of sitting judges. That (locking up judges) should not have happened. I dont respect all those things, he said.        
	According to Putte Gowda, an order by a special bench of the high court staying the associations resolution for a boycott was central to the agitation. That order passed on Saturday created all these problems, he said, citing a 2001 decision of the Supreme Court which allowed advocates to abstain from court in the rarest of rare instances.        
	Putte Gowda said Justice Gopala Gowda and Justice Nagarathna were allowed to leave the hall after he and the chief justice went there and spoke to the advocates.         
	A television crew member was also allegedly assaulted by advocates, but Putte Gowda said it wasnt clear if others were responsible for that.        
	Court proceedings are expected to resume tomorrow, Putte Gowda said. This agitation is to uphold the dignity and integrity of the court. We have the highest respect for the judges, he said.         
	The agitation against Justice Dinakaran is gaining momentum in his home state Tamil Nadu.        
	Five leaders of the CPM farmers wing were held under preventive custody on Sunday when they insisted on proceeding with their direct action to reclaim government land allegedly encroached upon by the judge.        
	The CPMs farmer unit, TN Vivasiaygal Sangam, has been spearheading the agitation to retrieve large portions of the 400 acres allegedly possessed by the judge in a village in Thiruvallur district.         
	Justice Dinakaran, in an interview to an English daily, claimed that he owned only 34 acres and his wife 16 in the Kaverirajapauram village, though some of his relatives held land contiguous to his holdings.

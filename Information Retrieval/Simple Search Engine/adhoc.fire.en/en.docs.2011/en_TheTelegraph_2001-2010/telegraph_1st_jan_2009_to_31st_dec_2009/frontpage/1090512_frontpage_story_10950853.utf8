	Ranchi, May 11: Team India skipper Mahendra Singh Dhonis request for a 0.9mm bore pistol licence is facing poll hiccups.        
	The offices of Ranchi deputy commissioner and senior superintendent of police (SSP) have not been able to timely process a reply sought by the Union home ministry.        
	It was a six-seven point questionnaire. We received it a month ago, but could not process it because we were busy with election work, admitted deputy commissioner Rajiv Arun Ekka, adding that the file had been sent to SSP Praveen Kumar Singh. Singh said he would act accordingly in a day or two.

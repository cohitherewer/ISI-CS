The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | KKR girls vie for IPL crown 
                                                                                                           KKR girls vie for IPL crown 
          PRATIM D. GUPTA                            Genna (top), Carla                                 
	Johannesburg, May 22: They are both 24, South African, with dark tresses and an ability to catch the eye in a crowd. They are also KKRs only hope for winning anything in IPL Season II.         
	Genna Cloud and Carla Dennis are vying to win the Indian Premier Leagues Miss Bollywood contest for the Kolkata Knight Riders.        
	They are two among 15 girls chosen through SMS voting from 48 who were picked from the crowds at the eight match venues.         
	All IPL teams dont have equal representation. There are five girls from Vijay Mallyas Royal Challengers Bangalore and just one each for Kings XI Punjab and Chennai Super Kings.         
	So, two of the six girls from the KKR gallery making it to the final list is an achievement, given the squads unimpressive show on the field. The boys, by the way, have returned home.         
	Genna, a marketing graduate from Johannesburg, got the second highest number of SMS votes, behind Chennais Dune Kossatz. She is one of the favourites to win the title.         
	Genna said she was banking on the judges sympathy. Hopefully everyone will support me and give me their sympathy vote with the Knight Riders eliminated so early in the tournament, said the aspiring singer at the Montecasino Theatre in Johannesburg this afternoon. The girls were rehearsing for the final round that will be held at the same place tomorrow night.         
	But the sympathy vote may prove hard to come by, for there is no SMS polling in the final.        
	Miss Bollywood will be chosen by a panel of judges that will have actresses Shilpa Shetty and Katrina Kaif, former Miss Universe Michelle Mclean and former Miss South Africa Jo-Ann Strauss.        
	The girls will walk the ramp in designer Tarun Tahilianis outfits.         
	Both Shah Rukh Khan and Preity Zinta have been spoilsports and have excused themselves from the event.         
	Shah Rukh, of course, is still a big attraction for the girls. Most of the 15 believe that the winners sash will not only make them richer by 50,000 rands, with a free trip to Mumbai thrown in, but will give them a chance to audition for an SRK film.         
	Oh, I want to learn cooking from him, gushed Gabriella Demetriades, who represents the Deccan Chargers. Shes a model and a contest favourite too.         
	But Aparna Behl, who was flown from Delhi to choreograph the girls for the final, said a model was not what the judges were looking for. In a competition like this one, you want a face which is familiar, which you can relate to, which can make you happy, which can make you cry, versatile as well as sexy someone like a Katrina Kaif. It is also, of course, about talent, she said.         
	The girls are polishing whatever skills they have.         
	Like Genna, Carla, who studies law but wants to be an actress, has watched Om Shanti Om four times. Oh, Shah Rukh Khan is so fantastic! she said. I hope I can do a film opposite him if I win. (As I am) representing Kolkata Knight Riders, I am sure he will treat me extra special.         
	But that will happen only if they dont choke like the boys in black and gold did on the greens.

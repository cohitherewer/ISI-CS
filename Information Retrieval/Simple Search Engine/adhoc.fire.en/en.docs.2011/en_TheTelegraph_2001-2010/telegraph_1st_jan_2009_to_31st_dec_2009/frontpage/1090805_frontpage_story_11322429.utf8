The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Try give-and-take approach
                                                                                                           Try give-and-take approach
  - Expert wants Ulfa to be treated on par with NSCN groups                                  
	Maj. Gen. (retd) Gaganjit Singh is a veteran in counter-terrorism operations in Assam, having served as the GOC, Red Horns Division. Maj. Gen. Singh, who retired in 2004 having last served with the Defence Intelligence Agency looking after counter-terrorism, continues his series exclusively for The Telegraph on the growing concerns over Ulfa and the NDFBs fresh incursions into Bhutan         
	It always pays to understand the mindset of an insurgent group and the mass base it has before preparing a blueprint to resolve the conflict. Having taken on the might of the State, it is very unlikely it will give up easily even if it is fighting a losing battle. Too much time, hard work, commitment and sacrifices  even if misplaced  have been invested in driving the wheels of a militant outfit. Too much self-respect is at stake. Therefore, the need is to find a practical approach, which will in no way undermine the position of the parties involved: in this case the government and the outfit.         
	A give-and-take approach is best suited to end long-drawn movements. For, there are no victors in this fight. It is a small price to pay for a bigger goal  long-term peace.         
	A give-and-take approach should be tried to resolve the Ulfa problem. We need to deal with the group with an open mind as well as an open heart, forsaking personal ego and pride.         
	Why? If we can have suspension of operations against the NSCN (I-M) and the NSCN (K), the largest and influential outfits of the Northeast, why treat Ulfa differently? Why cant we suspend operations against its cadres by putting necessary safeguards in place? If we can talk with the NSCN groups on all subjects, then why should we set preconditions while dealing with Ulfa? The NSCN (I-M) had forwarded a series of demands of which most have been accepted. Talks are still on to resolve the other demands. Why cant we take the same route to peace with Ulfa?         
	The benefits of getting Ulfa to the talks table are manifold. Neutralising the outfit would have a sobering impact on the smaller outfits because Ulfa continues to be a source of inspiration, moral support, finance and arms to them. The time is now right to get them to the negotiating table.               
	When Ulfa-constituted Peoples Consultative Group (PCG) initiated talks in 2005, the outfit was under no pressure. It used the ceasefire to regroup. But things have changed since. The change of guard in Bangladesh should be exploited to put pressure on the outfit to sit for genuine peace talks. Chances are it will come for talks rather than risk annoying Dhaka.         
	In fact, we are maintaining a very cordial relationship with our neighbours  Bhutan, Nepal and, of late, Bangladesh. We must remain in regular touch  in bad and good times to solve the problems connected with insurgent groups operating in Assam and the Northeast. We need to be able to impress upon them that outfits can upset the peace of their country as they can do in our own. Sustained engagement and backing each others efforts should be the main objective now.         
	The solution is there provided we set aside our vested interests and work together towards fanning goodwill for peace in Assam. Public support is with the government, a weapon the government can always use if things start to fall apart or go in the wrong direction.                 
	Next: Unified Command should become more proactive

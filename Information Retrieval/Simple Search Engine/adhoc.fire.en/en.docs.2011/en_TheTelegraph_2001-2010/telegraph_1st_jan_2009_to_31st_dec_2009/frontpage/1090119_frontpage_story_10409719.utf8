The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | If Anita flew, must be to Gulf

  - Mumbai witness version not implausible but US trip unlikely: Official        K.P. NAYAR                            A helicopter hovers over Marine Drive during the Mumbai Marathon on Sunday. (Fotocorp)                                       
	Washington, Jan. 18: Anita Uddaiya, who witnessed the terrorist landing in Mumbai in November, is unlikely to have been taken to the US for questioning, according to an intelligence source here familiar with such operations by American agencies.        
	The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity so as to be able to discuss the issue freely, said it was more likely that she was taken to a Gulf state, if her accounts of being abducted and flown out of Mumbai were, indeed, true.        
	The source, which discussed the case at length with The Telegraph here during the weekend, revealed that every facility of every kind that American intelligence agencies have at their headquarters in the US has now been replicated in the Gulf states for dealing with terrorist suspects, Iraqi insurgents and others sought by the US from elsewhere in West Asia, Pakistan and Afghanistan.        
	The Gulf states eat out of American hands, co-operating in everything the US intelligence asks for, the official added.        
	The official dismissed with ill-concealed contempt, denials by the US embassy in New Delhi to sections of the Indian media that Uddaiya was not flown to the US or that the US government was not involved in any effort to exclusively question her.        
	The reality is that even if Uddaiyas version of events is true, nobody in the US embassy in New Delhi who is authorised to talk to the media would be told about any such operation.        
	If it did take place, the official said, it is most likely that even the ambassador, David Mulford, would not know about it. That is not the way the CIA conducts sensitive operations, the official contented.        
	Throughout the conversation, the intelligence source claimed not to have any personal knowledge of American contacts with Uddaiya, but pointed out that an operation of the kind she described would be known to very few people in the US government.        
	Her version events is not implausible. But something like that would require clearance by the US President, and if that is not sought, definitely a nod from the White House chief of staff, the official insisted.         
	The consequences of something going wrong can be serious. Usually, the state department is kept in the dark because historically the CIA does not trust career diplomats and consider them to be namby pambies with no stomach for tough action.        
	The source pointed out that being transition time, any US agency plotting such an operation, if at all, would have been doubly mindful of the consequences and clearances. You do a disservice to your cause if the new administration has to start on a wrong wicket with a friendly country because of a botched covert operation.        
	Questioned persistently on Uddaiyas accounts about her flight, the source said doubts about her being flown to the US were based on Americas extreme reluctance to land abducted or detained foreigners on its soil for fear of litigation at any later stage.        
	US laws are so complex and the propensity for litigation on such issues is so common that intelligence agencies prefer to question people on foreign soil.        
	It was pointed out that the whole rationale for setting up the prison camp in Guantanamo was the desire of the Bush administration not to get entangled in the US judicial system. But even so, the administration had to spend so much time and resources in courts, fighting to keep people in Guantanamo.        
	The official had a sanguine view of US approach to terrorism today. Look, five years ago, everybody in Washington would have jumped at the thought of getting their hands on someone who had seen terrorists actually land somewhere. Now people are more calm, more rational. Would someone today take the trouble and incur the expense of sending a Hercules transport plane to fly an Anita Uddaiya all the way to the US and back? Unlikely. That is why the idea of flying her to the Gulf, if at all, is more plausible.        
	In any dust-up in India over Uddaiyas claims, the intelligence source cautioned against losing sight of the fact that she is not a terrorist suspect. She is only a witness. Her use for any US interrogators is a world apart from that of questioning a terrorist suspect. The hint obviously was that it was in a good cause.        
	On grounds of professional confidentiality, the source declined to go into details of what possibly could have been done with her material answers, but others said it would be valuable in electronic profiling of terrorists if Uddaiya was questioned in a specially equipped environment.

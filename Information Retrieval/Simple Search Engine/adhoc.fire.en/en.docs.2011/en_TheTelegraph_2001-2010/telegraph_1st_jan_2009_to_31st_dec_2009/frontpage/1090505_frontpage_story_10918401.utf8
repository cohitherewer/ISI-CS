          SAMYABRATA RAY GOSWAMI                            Akshay                                  
	Mumbai, May 4: What Shah Rukh and Aamir couldnt, Akshay just might have.        
	The month-long standoff between Bollywood producers and multiplex owners that had stalled the release of Hindi films is expected to be sorted out tomorrow at a meeting in Mumbai. Plex owners, reeling from losses, are understood to be considering a new revenue model agreeable to all.        
	Industry sources said an early resolution was being sought by both parties to ensure there was no delay in the release of the Akshay Kumar-Kareena Kapoor starrer Kambakkht Ishq, previously slated to hit the screens in end-May.        
	Before any film releases, there is a minimum four-week promotion period. If the strike is called off now, then Akshays movie can be released in early June. The actor has had a series of flops and there is a lot of industry money riding on him, said a Bollywood producer, who is part of the negotiations with national multiplex chains.         
	The strike began on April 4, a day after Akshays 8x10 Tasveer released. It bombed, as had Akshays January big-budget release Chandni Chowk to China. Much, therefore, rides on the Sajid Nadiadwala-produced Kambakkht Ishq, which is estimated to have a budget of around Rs 60 crore and is said to have a cameo by Hollywood megastar Sylvester Stallone.         
	It is Akshays film that has brought the warring parties down from their high horses, said the producer.        
	A month ago, the Khan superstars  SRK and Aamir, not the best of buddies  had shared the stage in a show of solidarity with the producers. But their call for a resolution of the crisis had not yielded any result.        
	Cracks have also appeared within the producers with Anurag Mittal agreeing to release his cricket-based film 99 at multiplexes at the old rates.

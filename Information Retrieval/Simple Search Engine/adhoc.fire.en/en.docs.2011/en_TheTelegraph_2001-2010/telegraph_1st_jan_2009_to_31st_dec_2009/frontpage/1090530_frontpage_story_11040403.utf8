The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | New boss, no names
                                                                                                           New boss, no names
  - Officials walk into shock of their lives          CHARU SUDAN KASTURI                                                    
	New Delhi, May 29: Everyone is a little nervous the day a new boss joins, but the bureaucrats at Shastri Bhavan werent expecting such a shock as this.        
	Arriving perhaps a little early this morning, the babus at the headquarters of Indias education and culture ministries froze to find their nameplates yanked off their office doors.        
	Not one, not two, but at least 15 officials  of director and joint secretary level  found themselves staring in nameless fear at empty spaces where their brass nameplates had been.        
	A mass purge, Mayavati style, the day Kapil Sibal takes over as education (human resource development) minister?        
	Then came the official notice.        
	And the babus breathed easy.        
	A thief, not a bureaucratic shuffle  always a possibility when a new minister takes over  was responsible.        
	We received the first worried call from an official early in the morning, asking about his missing nameplate, an official from the administration section of Shastri Bhavan said.        
	We went and checked. We found that around 20 had been stolen. Of these, at least 15 appear to have been stolen last night.        
	Around five were stolen earlier this week, although the complaints about them came in today along with the rest, the official said.        
	The administration section issued a notice explaining the theft and informing the bureaucrats that police would be informed.        
	By then, Sibal had taken charge in his third-floor office  his nameplate had already been screwed on.        
	It was quite a shock. Imagine the first day of your new boss, and your nameplate is no longer to be found outside your room. It conjures up all kinds of fears in your mind, a bureaucrat laughed later in the afternoon.        
	The government is yet to announce any minister for culture, but an official who lost his nameplate said that immediately after the discovery, he had called up a subordinate to ask: Mantri announce to nahi huen na (the minister hasnt yet been announced, right)?        
	The nameplates were mostly stolen from what is known as the C wing of Shastri Bhavan  from the second, third and fourth floors that are occupied by the HRD and culture ministries.        
	The brass plates can be melted and remoulded, and each could be worth Rs 150 to the thief.        
	While some of the nameplates were unscrewed, others were brutally pulled off  often leaving the first and the last letters of the officials name hanging from the door, nailed to it by the still embedded screws.        
	Authorities suspect insiders: the thief apparently entered the corridors after working hours, when the building is relatively less accessible.

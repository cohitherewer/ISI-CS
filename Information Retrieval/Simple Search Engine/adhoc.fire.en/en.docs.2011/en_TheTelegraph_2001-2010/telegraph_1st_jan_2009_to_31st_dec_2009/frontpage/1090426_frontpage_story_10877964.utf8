The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Aussie tennis cowers in poll fear 
                                                                                                           Aussie tennis cowers in poll fear 
  - Team pulls out of Chennai Davis Cup tie, PC contests IPL parallel          OUR BUREAU AND AGENCIES                            The Nungambakkam stadium, the venue of the Davis Cup tie in Chennai                                      
	April 25: One of Americas closest allies in the war on terror, launched in the name of freedom and democracy, has been spooked by the worlds biggest democratic exercise.        
	Tennis Australia (TA) today pulled out of the May 8-10 Davis Cup tie against India in Chennai mentioning security fears because of the election (Chennai votes on May 13) and citing how the IPL had been moved out of India.        
	Home minister P. Chidambaram, however, argued there could be no comparison between the 59-game, multi-venue IPL and a single tie of the worlds top inter-nation tennis meet. The Davis Cup is one match, one visiting team, one venue, one small stadium, three days. India and the event are completely safe. Foolproof security can and will be provided, he said.        
	TAs move comes a day after the International Tennis Federation (ITF) rejected its plea to shift the tie out of the subcontinent, saying it was satisfied with security in India.        
	The Australians, who described India as an area of high risk, appear to be equating the country with Pakistan where Sri Lankan cricketers were ambushed last month  one of the reasons behind the TAs request for the venue shift.        
	We have major security concerns, particularly during the (Indian) election, said TA president Geoff Pollard, whose country has hardly half-a-dozen major parties and just 150 Lower House constituencies. We gave the ITF, and therefore the Indians, a list of the security requirements reasonably close to what you would give to a head of state. They were providing security but nothing like the level we asked for.        
	The ITF has disagreed with TAs decision and awarded the Asia-Oceania Group I tie to India, which advances to the World Group playoffs in September. Australia  a 28-time Davis Cup champion  now faces a $100,000 fine and a possible ban from next years tournament.        
	Australian captain John Fitzgerald lambasted the ITF as irresponsible. He said: I believe they say the election is not a cause for concern, the IPL moving is not relevant and that an ATP tournament held in January shows it is safe to play in Chennai.        
	The last reference was to the Chennai Open where 50-odd foreign players, such as former world No. 1 Carlos Moya of Spain, had taken part two months after the Mumbai attacks, although no Australian participated.         
	Fitzgerald also referred to Wednesdays four-hour train hijack by Maoists in Jharkhand. A train was hijacked this week, but that does not alter their (ITFs) thoughts. Did the IPL move for no reason? he said. We have worked so hard to get back into World Group contention; to have it snatched away like this is gut-wrenching.        
	Australia, which had earlier boycotted a junior tennis event in Indonesia, has a history of citing security and pulling out of cricket tours. It forced the Pakistanis to shift matches to Sri Lanka and Sharjah in 2002, within months of joining George Bushs terror war in Afghanistan, and is now playing them in the UAE.        
	Australian foreign minister Stephen Smith said TA made its own decision.        
	Chennai police had arranged security for the December 11-15 India-England Test match held days after the Mumbai carnage. We are totally disappointed, state tennis chief M.A. Alagappan said, adding that security arrangements would have needed to take less than 10,000 spectators into account.        
	A senior police officer said: Even all protests on the Lankan Tamil issue have been peaceful.        
	Im disappointed since the tournament was returning to Chennai after three decades, former Davis Cup captain Ramesh Krishnan said. A young Vijay Amritraj had then stretched Australian legend John Newcombe but India lost.

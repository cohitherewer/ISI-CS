          SANJAY K JHA AND RASHEED KIDWAI                      LK Advani and Manmohan Singh at Parliament House in New Delhi on Tuesday. (PTI)                          
	New Delhi, April 14: The morning showed the night.        
	L.K. Advani stayed away from a dinner hosted by the Prime Minister tonight after an icy encounter in the morning when the two leaders shook hands but did not speak.        
	The decision to skip the farewell dinner for Lok Sabha Speaker Somnath Chatterjee follows a war of words over the past few days between Advani and Manmohan Singh, who made no eye contact for most of the 15-20 minutes they were together in Parliament House today for the birth anniversary of B.R. Ambedkar.        
	Senior leaders of all parties were invited to the dinner.        
	Advanis close aide Deepak Chopra said: Advaniji has called an important review meeting for poll preparations at his residence tonight. He has to be present here and hence he is not going for dinner.        
	The BJP never was on good terms with the Speaker.        
	The CPM, which expelled Somnath for putting Parliament before party, also skipped the dinner.         
	Sources in the BJP, however, said the Prime Minister was the reason for Advanis absence, not Somnath or the review meeting. The BJPs candidate for Prime Minister, hurt that Manmohan had hit back at Advani for calling him weak, felt slighted this morning, the sources said.         
	Although the two did shake hands when their eyes met, no one present saw the leaders exchange a word. Both greeted other leaders, and Manmohan chatted with Vice-President Hamid Ansari, but was not seen speaking to Advani who sat in between. A photograph showed the Prime Minister speaking and the BJP leader listening, but it was not clear who Manmohan was addressing.        
	At one point, Advani, usually seen with hands folded, looked as if he was approaching the Prime Minister but then greeted other guests. Manmohan appeared not to have seen him.        
	So bitter has been their fight over the past days that even if there was no deliberate chill, onlookers sensed one.         
	The Congress denied any slight. The Prime Minister has been in public life for years and he has always been known to be humble. He is a gentleman who observes all courtesies, party spokesperson Abhishek Manu Singhvi said.        
	Singhvi added: Let me assure you that the Prime Minister will continue to observe all constitutional responsibilities and decorum.        
	A Congress functionary questioned the absence of Advani, who is the leader of the Opposition, from the dinner in the Speakers honour.         
	Advani today accused the Congress of not doing justice to Ambedkar, and the Prime Minister replied that the party always viewed Ambedkar as a pathfinder and the architect of the Indian Constitution. The Congress party has the greatest of respect for him.        
	Priyanka Gandhi, campaigning in Amethi, described Advanis remark as a completely futile accusation.        
	At Mandla in Madhya Pradesh, Sonia Gandhi targeted Advani for questioning Manmohans credentials, and again brought up his conduct during the Kandahar hijack.        
	Rahul Gandhi in Bathinda described Manmohan as Sher-e-Punjab (Lion of Punjab), a title normally reserved for legendary 18th century ruler Maharaja Ranjit Singh.         
	The fightback as a team, in evidence over the past few days, appears to have rattled the BJP, which is now insisting its campaign calling Manmohan the weakest Prime Minister was not personal.         
	While Arun Jaitley and Narendra Modi have welcomed the face-off, BJP spokesperson Ravi Shankar Prasad decried it as the Congresss attempt to divert attention from the real issues.

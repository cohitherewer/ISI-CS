  - Mines secy wants Ghatkuri U-turn        AMIT GUPTA                                               
	Ranchi, Feb. 5: The state mines department has asked the governor to spike the order of the former Shibu Soren government that sought to allow six private firms access to the prized Ghatkuri iron ore reserves, otherwise set aside for PSUs.        
	Mines secretary Santosh Kumar Satpathys recommendation, made to the governor now heading the affairs of the state under Presidents rule, will undo one of the most controversial decisions of the Soren government that sought to allocate a better part of the over 3,000 hectare reserves in West Singhbhum to private players bypassing over 150 applicants.        
	The Ghatkuri mines, considered only second to Chiria in terms of quality of deposits, has been reserved for PSUs through three notifications by earlier governments.        
	But the Soren government wanted to change that and even submitted an affidavit in Supreme Court to grant a large part of the reserves to the six private firms.         
	Satpathy refused to elaborate on the details of his recommendation he was sending to Razi, but maintained that the state government submitted the affidavit in the apex court on December 15 with malafide intention aimed at benefiting private companies, some of whom were not even ready to add value to the ore in the state itself.         
	We cannot do this. We have to change the affidavit submitted at the Supreme Court, his recommendation apparently reads.         
	The state mines departments move was likely to stir a hornets nest in the days to come as the six firms were likely to knock on the door of the Supreme Court again. Razis final opinion in the matter will also be crucial.         
	The six private firms who would have been benefitted by the Soren governments move include Monnet Ispat and Energy Limited, Jharkhand Ispat Limited, Prakash Ispat Limited, Adhunik Alloys and Power Limited, Abhijeet Infrastructure Limited and Ispat Industries Limited.         
	Except for Monet Ispat, all have been allotted iro-ore mines elsewhere.         
	For instance, Anandita Traders, a sister concern of Jharkhand Ispat, has been allotted mines in the Parambalajori area (116.5 hectares), Ispat Industries in Latua (520 hectares) and Horizon Iron, a sister concern of Prakash Ispat in Sitaruiya (215 hectares). Adhunik Alloys amp; Power Limited also enjoys mining rights, courtesy its acquisition of Orissa Manganese and Mineral. Abhijeet Infrastructure Limited has also been promised a mine in another area.        
	The Ghatkuri mines controversy came to the fore with four steel making giants, ArcelorMittal, Tata Steel, JSW Steels Jharkhand Limited and Rooongta Mines, either intervening or filing an interlocutory petition in the apex court after the Soren government decided to grant access to private players, most of whom were small firms with plans to set up steel plants of about 1 MT capacity.         
	For Ghatkuri, there were around 150-odd applicants, including five PSUs, for a slice of the reserves over the last couple of years.         
	But opinion within the industry was almost unanimous that the mines  so far reserved for PSUs  could not be handed over to private players unless first de-reserved through a gazzette notification and thrown open to all applicants.

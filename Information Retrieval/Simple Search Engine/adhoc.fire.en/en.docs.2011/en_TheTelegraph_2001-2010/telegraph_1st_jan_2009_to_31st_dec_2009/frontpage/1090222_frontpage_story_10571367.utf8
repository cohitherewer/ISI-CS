          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Bhubaneswar, Feb. 21: Villagers living off the coast would soon be issued identity cards as a precautionary measure to prevent infiltration through sea routes.        
	Orissa has a 480km-long coastline, which is almost unguarded and thus vulnerable to infiltration of the kind that led to the 26/11 attacks in Mumbai. There have also been reports of infiltration of Bangladeshi nationals to the coastal districts of Kendrapara and Jagatsinghpur.        
	Home secretary A.P. Padhi said issuing of identity card was expected to curb infiltration from the sea. The process will start from the Ersama area in Jagatsinghpur district on an experimental basis. If the experiment proved successful, it would be extended to other coastal villages, he added.        
	Residents above 18 years and living in selected coastal villages would be issued the tamper-proof, non-transferable identity cards, said Padhi. The Union government would support the technical and financial parts of the project, he added.        
	Earlier last month, a decision was taken to fit global positioning system (GPS) sets on fishing trawlers on the lines of Karnataka and Tamil Nadu to keep track of their movements along the vulnerable Orissa coast. An estimated 9,200 fishing trawlers and boats are operating along Orissa the coast, which can be brought under surveillance through GPS.        
	The Centre also sanctioned five marine police stations. Out of these, three are expected to be functional by March, sources said.         
	These marine police stations will be located at Arjipalli in Ganjam district, Paradip in Jagatsinghpur and Balaramgadi in Balasore. Two more coastal police stations are proposed to be set up at Jambu in Kendrapara and Dhamra in Bhadrak.         
	Apart from the five marine police stations, a Coast Guard station with 200 personnel would be set up at Gopalpur. A shooting range for the force is also coming up at Paradip.

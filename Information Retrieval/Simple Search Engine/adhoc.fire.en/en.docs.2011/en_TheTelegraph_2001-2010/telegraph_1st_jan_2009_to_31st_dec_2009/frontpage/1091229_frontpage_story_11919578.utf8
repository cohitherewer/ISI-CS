          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                               
	New Delhi, Dec. 28: External affairs minister S.M. Krishna was today livid with junior Shashi Tharoors tweet questioning the new visa rules.        
	The BJP was predictably critical, the Congress  at least on record  indulgent, and the home ministry, which Tharoor had tangentially criticised, indifferent.         
	Tharoor himself was unrepentant.        
	The minister of state had objected to the tightening of the visa rules after the David Headley controversy in a comment on the social networking site Twitter yesterday.        
	Are we going 2 allow terrorists 2 make us less welcoming, Tharoor had twitted.        
	Krishna was harsh in his response. These issues (visa rules) are not to be discussed in public. If there are any perceptions, then I think it should be sorted out within the four walls of the ministry, he said.         
	The business of government is far too serious. It has to be conducted in a manner in which we decide.        
	Krishna ruled out any difference of opinion between the ministries of external affairs and home. We have gone along with the home ministry. As far as the ministry of external affairs is concerned, there is no ambiguity.        
	Tharoor, who had earlier incurred the wrath of the party with a wisecrack on the governments austerity drive, thanked people on Twitter for supporting his view, suggesting that he was taking the criticism in his stride.         
	The home ministry, which had pushed for tightening the rules to bar foreigners holding long-term multi-entry tourist visas from re-entering the country before two months since their last departure, dismissed the possibility of a rethink.         
	Congress spokesman Shakeel Ahmed said: Tharoor has a human touch. But for the government, there are compulsions pertaining to security.        
	The BJP termed Tharoors remarks callous.

                                                                                                           Buddha, Mamata set up relief test for PM 
          OUR BUREAU                              
	May 28: Prime Minister Manmohan Singh will now have to choose between his esteemed colleague Mamata Banerjee and one-time good friend Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee.        
	Chief minister Bhattacharjee today wrote to the Prime Minister asking the devastation by Cyclone Aila be declared a national calamity and seeking a central grant of at least Rs 1,000 crore.        
	But Mamata, now part of the central government, has made it clear she is against Delhi handing any financial aid directly to the Bengal government.        
	Mamata definitely wants aid for the affected people, but she doesnt want the money sent to the state government since it will not reach the people, said Trinamul MP Saugata Ray. I am sure she will be consulted about it (the aid request). She wants the money sent directly to the panchayats.        
	He wondered whether the state government sent the letter in a hurry to pre-empt Mamata. In two of the worst-hit districts, South 24-Parganas and East Midnapore, Trinamul runs the zilla parishads.        
	The states rural development and panchayat secretary, M.N. Roy, said what Trinamul was demanding was possible. The Centre can, through an executive order, transfer funds directly to the panchayats. However, it has to clearly explain the necessity and purpose of it to the state government.        
	Mamata, who met finance minister Pranab Mukherjee today, said the Centre was working on a relief package and would announce it soon.        
	Bhattacharjees letter to Singh says: It is our view that it (damage by Aila) should be declared a national calamity. A central team may be sent to Bengal to assess the situation with state officials. I request you to provide at least Rs 1,000 crore from the National Calamity Contingency Fund.        
	Bhattacharjee reminded the Prime Minister that Singh had told him during a phone conversation on May 26, the day after Aila struck, to let me know the nature of central assistance required.        
	The chief minister added that the relief bill might exceed Rs 1,500 crore, and said a detailed report would shortly be sent to Delhi.        
	The Centre assesses a situation independently before it accepts a states request to declare a national calamity (or disaster), a member of the National Disaster Management Authority said.         
	Such a request would imply the state is unable to cope with the situation on its own, said the member, Lt Gen (retired) Janak Raj Bhardwaj.        
	When a national calamity is declared, the level of relief from the Centre rises. The National Committee on Management of Calamities assesses the need for relief and monitors the progress daily.        
	Bengal finance minister Asim Dasgupta said Aila had affected 53 lakh people, left 115 dead and damaged 5.24 lakh houses.        
	But Ray said: I cant understand how the state government could put a figure on the damage in such a short time.

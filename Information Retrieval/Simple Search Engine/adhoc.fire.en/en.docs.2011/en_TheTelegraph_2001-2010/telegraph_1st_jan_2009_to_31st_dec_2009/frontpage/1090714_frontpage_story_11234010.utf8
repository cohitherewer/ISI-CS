  - Jatin Das races against time to finish Chelsea mural          AMIT ROY                            Jatin Das and a part of his mural outside the Chelsea Arts Club                                        
	London, July 13: By close of play yesterday, the mural by Jatin Das on the outside faade of the Chelsea Arts Club in London had started to take shape.        
	You like this sexy stuff, remarked a German passerby, fascinated by the figures emerging on the pure white walls of 143 Old Church Street.        
	Das gently corrected the man: Not sexy, its erotic.        
	Das, who put up the idea of the mural to the club where he has been a member for over 20 years, said his proposal was eagerly accepted as wonderful.        
	I am not being paid, said the 67-year-old painter. But I am getting board, lodging and drinks free.        
	The Chelsea Arts Club is over 150 years old and has 2,400 artists and writers as its members. There is a long waiting list to join the club.        
	Having started early yesterday, the mural will have to be completed by Tuesday evening when Das will celebrate with a party where he is threatening to cook Indian food.        
	Yesterday, rather like the Test match in Cardiff, the proceedings were interrupted by frequent showers.        
	With the help of the stoutly built German, who was wondering if he could persuade the artist to do his portrait (commission me and I will paint you), Das moved the mobile scaffold from one side of the door to the other.                  Dass mural      
	Just wait, an idea is coming, he told The Telegraph.        
	 Within a few minutes, a face had appeared. Then he put two enigmatic black dots on the walls  within seconds they had been transformed into nipples. The man clearly had magic in his hands. His strokes were deft and assured.        
	 Not for nothing had the artist admonished the German who had wanted to see examples of his work before deciding whether to risk a commission: I have been painting for 50 years.        
	 Das explained: I decided to do the mural in black and white, no colours. I am using black emulsion. It is washable but wont be affected by rain once it dries.        
	 He had not set out with the figures in mind. I just look at the space and it comes. It is like one line of a poem guiding you to the next.        
	 The German was warming to the theme of the voluptuous women, probably unlike anything he had seen back in the Fatherland.        
	 Good, he muttered. He corrected himself: Very good.        
	 Das, dressed in black tee shirt and black tracksuit bottom, set his black hat at a rakish angle and scampered up the scaffolding with the agility of a black cat clutching a black brush with black paint.         
	 Another idea was coming.

          OUR CORRESPONDENT                                              Students enjoy the attention in Class V, labelled Booth No. 156, of Dispur Government Higher Secondary School on Tuesday, two days before polling. Picture by Eastern Projections    
	Guwahati, April 22: The big question at Booth Number 156 tomorrow will not be who will win the election but whether Voter 726 will stand in queue.        
	In the rare event of the stickler for rules jumping the queue, the next in line  Voter 727  can be counted upon to remind the Prime Minister of India how to be a model voter.        
	Manmohan Singh, occasional resident of House No. 3989, Nandan Nagar, Sarumataria, Dispur (Guwahati), and current occupant of the Prime Ministers chair, is scheduled to cast his vote for the first time from his home state tomorrow. He has been assigned the number 726 on the voters list.        
	Singh, accompanied by wife Gursharan Kaur (Voter 727), is expected to reach Assam tomorrow, if the weather and the security situation permit. The state has been sending him to the Rajya Sabha since 1991.        
	Booth No. 156 has been set up at Dispur Government Higher Secondary School in Sarumataria, a residential neighbourhood close to Dispurs capital complex.        
	The three-storeyed pink-and-red building  easily Dispurs most famous address overnight  has been ringed by gun-toting security forces and illuminated by halogen lamps.        
	The school is about 200 metres from Singhs two-storeyed rented house. The road here has been black-topped, a culvert along the way given a fresh coat of paint, the lanes and bylanes have been swept clean and the garbage vats cleared.        
	The entire locality is very proud to have the Prime Minister as a voter here. It is a privilege for us to vote alongside him, said Punyabrat Saikia, a retired state government official who is Singhs neighbour.        
	But not everyone is brimming with pride. Kallol Das, a student who stays in Sarumataria, waved off the visit as a political gimmick. The Congress expects that more people would come out to vote if the Prime Minister comes that is what they want, he said.        
	Common people standing in queue since morning will have to suffer, Das added.        
	A Congress source, however, said Singh was ready to stand in queue, if required. The Prime Minister said he did not want the voters disturbed by his presence.        
	According to the Election Commission guidelines, only one personal bodyguard will be allowed inside the both while the others will have to wait outside, Assam DGP G.M. Srivastava said.         
	School principal Bilibala Devi hoped Singh would come to Dispur more frequently so that our school gets more benefits. Like the road in front has been repaired for his visit.

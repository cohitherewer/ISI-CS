The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Nadal crashes out in night of upsets

	Paris, May 31: Rafael Nadal, the king of clay, took an early bow from his biggest stage today, leaving it for arch-rival Roger Federer to try and prove himself the games greatest player all surfaces combined.        
	The world No. 1 Spaniard lost his first match ever at the French Open, after 31 wins on the trot and four straight titles, dumped by an upstart he had dubbed one of the most unpopular players in the locker room two years ago. Swede Robin Soderling, seeded 23rd, won the fourth-round match 6-2, 6-7, 6-4, 7-6.         
	On a night of upsets, defending womens champion Ana Ivanovic of Serbia too lost 2-6, 3-6 to Belarus teen Victoria Azarenka  the first time in five years when both holders have lost in the same round at a Grand Slam.        
	I didnt play my best. Its not a tragedy, I had to lose one day. I must accept my defeats with the same level of calm that I accept my victories, the ever gracious Nadal said. He (Soderling) didnt surprise me because I know how he plays and how dangerous he can be.        
	The Swede had pushed Nadal to five sets in an acrimonious third-round game in Wimbledon 2007, provoking a rare personal attack from the Spaniard.        
	But this was clay, the gritty surface where Nadal has been the most formidable force since Bjorn Borg, whose record of four straight French crowns he was looking to surpass this year.        
	This was clay, where Nadal had overwhelmed Soderling, 6-1, 6-0, last month in Rome.        
	This was clay, which explains why, as the match hurtled towards a potential conclusion in the fourth set, there was no room to be had in the players box and long lines waited to gain entry outside the stadium.        
	Nadal had never been pushed to five sets in victory at Roland Garros, nor was he in defeat today. He had not lost a set here since the 2007 final against Federer, who would see todays result as the removal of a stumbling block from his path.        
	If clay is Nadals strongest surface, it has been Federers weakest. The French Open is the lone major to have eluded the Swiss, leaving as big a hole in his CV as in his fans claims that he is historys undisputed greatest.        
	A week on, that mantle could be his, simultaneously drawing him level with the retired Pete Samprass overall Grand Slam record of 14 titles.        
	Nadal, who expanded his own CV last year by winning the Australian Open and Wimbledon, must now focus on defending his Big W crown in July. But first, a little rest and relaxation.        
	Right now, my preparation is for the swimming pool at my house, he joked. Give me three more days.        
	Soderling, whose aggressive play and booming forehands Nadal found impossible to handle, said: I told myself this is just another match. All the time, I was trying to play as if it was a training session. I played a great match. If he thinks he plays bad, thats his choice.        
	Nadal made errors off the ground from positions where he would normally generate winners or high-bouncing shots to the corners. He also looked, at times, less convincing than normal on defence, as Soderling made him stretch and then stretch some more.

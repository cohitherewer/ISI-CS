The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Legal heirs, but share of Gayatri estate uncertain
                                                                                                           Legal heirs, but share of Gayatri estate uncertain
          RAKHEE ROY TALUKDAR                                  (From top) Gayatri Devi, Devraj Kumar and Lalitya Kumari                                 
	Jaipur, Aug. 23: Gayatri Devis grandchildren may have become the legal heirs of her vast estates but how much of it would actually pass to them is unclear because most of the property is under litigation.        
	Devraj Kumar, grandson of the former Maharani, has claimed the royal family knows about the will. However, sources close to the family said the will did not specify the list of properties and, therefore, remained ambiguous.        
	D.K. Malhotra, counsel for Devraj, echoed him and told The Telegraph that a meeting was held two days ago. The royal family was supposed to have another meeting, he said.        
	Malhotra said the list of properties did not really matter as the intention of the person writing the will was clear since it says that it is in the grandchildrens favour, giving them (Devraj and his sister Lalitya Kumari) all of Gayatri Devis properties.        
	The counsel, however, would not say when the will  written in May this year  was handed over to the grandchildren, saying it was a family matter.         
	The two signatories in the document are Bhawani Singh, the former queens eldest stepson, and Ayub Khan, her personal secretary.        
	Malhotra said it was for Prithviraj Singh, another of the former Maharanis three stepsons who looked after her estates and had the power of attorney, to come forward and give us the account of her properties and papers.         
	It is our wishful thinking that no more disputes would arise or contenders would come forward. Since the grandchildren are the natural legal heirs, they should get their due amicably, he said.        
	Malhotra said that Prithviraj, who looks after the 18th-century Jai Mahal Palace  now run as a hotel worth Rs 720 crore and was bequeathed to Gayatri Devis late son Jagat Singh  was yet to transfer Jagat Singhs shares to his children (Devraj and Lalitya).         
	At least 30 cases regarding royal property are pending in various courts, with the Supreme Court appointing a receiver on 21 of them. Legal experts say a problem could arise if any of these disputed properties is named in the will.        
	A hearing on a partition case filed by Jagat Singh in 1986 in Delhi High Court, seeking its intervention in estates and belongings of the late Maharaja Sawai Man Singh  Gayatri Devi was his third wife  is scheduled for August 27 this year.         
	The other parties in the suit were Gayatri Devi, Prithviraj and Jai Singh, the third stepson.         
	The suit was against Bhawani Singh, who is now contesting it under the law of primogeniture in which the eldest son has the right to inherit all properties. Most of Indias erstwhile royal families are governed by this law. Some of the disputed properties include land around Rambagh Palace, also run as a hotel, the Rambagh Palace staff quarters, a bungalow in front of Rambagh Palace, City Palace, Raj Mahal Palace, Laxmi Vilas, Moti Doongri Fort, Ashok Club in Jaipur, Jaipur House in New Delhi and the Jaipur Palace in Mount Abu.        
	A case is pending against the Jaipur Development Authority, which had acquired 322 bighas surrounding Rambagh Palace hotel and Lily Pool, where Gayatri Devi stayed.        
	The authority was asked to pay Rs 4.16 crore as compensation but Gayatri Devis contention was that the acquisition had been done without any notification, said G.K. Garg, her counsel in the case.        
	Sources said the properties of Gayatri Devi which are free of any dispute are a house in London, a bungalow in Lodhi estate in Delhi and her stake in Rambagh Palace hotel.

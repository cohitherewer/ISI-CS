  England, SA in race to host IPL
          LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI                                              
	March 22: England is emerging as the preferred venue for the second edition of the Indian Premier League (IPL), described as a most valuable property by its promoters, the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI).        
	South Africa is choice No. 2, but could actually play host if the T20 tournament cant be worked around the County Championship, which gets under way on April 15, just days after the IPLs April 10 start.        
	Who (England amp; Wales Cricket Board/Cricket South Africa) offers a better deal will also be a big consideration, but the logistics would be easier in England.        
	Late at night, sources in London informed this paper that counties had begun to queue up to play host. The International Cricket Council, though, may not be too amused as the IPL could affect gate receipts during the World T20, in England, from June 5.         
	In taking the IPL out of the country, the BCCI has confirmed that the tournament is more about dollars and less about cricket, which is the basis of its existence.        
	We made the best endeavours. However, because of the attitude of the (state) governments. we were forced to move the event out of India, BCCI president Shashank Manohar said in Mumbai.        
	The announcement came a little past noon, after an emergent working committee meeting rubber-stamped a decision taken by Manohar, former president Sharad Pawar, secretary (and Chennai Super Kings owner) N. Srinivasan and the IPL chairman, Lalit Modi.        
	Ironically, till the other day, Modi had tied the hosting of the tournament to national pride! Moreover, the city-based loyalty concept has been consigned to the Arabian Sea, which is metres away from the Cricket Centre, where the meeting was held.        
	Nobody said a word when Manohar, who set the ball rolling, explained that because of a clash with the general elections, a most valuable property couldnt be postponed as there was no window to reschedule this year. Everything was over in 15 minutes, somebody present at the meeting conveyed to The Telegraph.        
	Asked why he didnt raise issues such as the investments made by staging centres in preparing for the second edition, the gentleman replied: When nobody else felt it necessary to seek clarifications, I decided to go along with the mood of the house. Also, I must admit I was absolutely taken aback by Manohars presentation.        
	Bottomline, then, is that not one official spoke up for the desi fan, for those whod helped make the inaugural edition, in 2008, such a stunning success.        
	After Manohar finished, Srinivasan presented the draft of a news release. Pawar suggested changes, which were promptly incorporated. Within the BCCI, after all, hes saheb.         
	Modi didnt speak till after the working committee had unanimously given its consent.         
	Clearly, with millions of dollars at stake, the BCCI couldnt risk the rejection of yet another schedule by the Union home ministry.        
	The franchise owners, one learns, had been sounded out some days ago, but the chalo overseas move only gained momentum after Maharashtras flip-flop.        
	That was the last straw. One realised that neither the Centre nor the concerned state governments would accommodate the IPL, is how another BCCI source put it.        
	Shah Rukh Khan, the Kolkata Knight Riders principal owner, gave his thumbs up, but hinted he and the others didnt have a choice.        
	As a resolution (to the jhamela over security), its a great decision. The team owners have decided to stick together and see this through. Basically, its a TV product.        
	Exactly. Which is why the BCCI has made a commitment that the matches would be played (and telecast) according to the timings in India  4pm and 8pm.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Mamata, govt add to Nano price
                                                                                                           Mamata, govt add to Nano price
          SAMBIT SAHA AND ANASUYA BASU                                               
	Calcutta, April 1: A Nano base model will cost Rs 19,422 more in Calcutta than in Delhi.        
	The reasons that push up the price of the worlds cheapest car can be traced to the programmes and policies of Mamata Banerjee and Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee.        
	If Mamata had not driven the factory out of Singur, each customer of a Nano (BSIII base model) could have saved at least Rs 7,420 that now goes into transporting the car from the Uttarakhand plant to dealers in Calcutta.        
	Another Rs 13,332 could have been spared had the Bhattacharjee government not stuck to a high-tax regime in Bengal.        
	For registration and one-time road tax, a private customer in Delhi spends Rs 5,168. In Calcutta, the same components will burn up as much as Rs 18,500 (which includes a five-year road tax).        
	Throw in some other minor variants such as charges for number plates and logistics: then the on-road price of a Nano (BSIII base model) in Calcutta will add up to Rs 154,668, against Rs 135,246 in Delhi. A difference of Rs 19,422.        
	The sharp difference became apparent today as Tata Motors unveiled the first batch of three Nano models in Calcutta and rolled out the price list.        
	A consumer in Calcutta has to pay extra on-road price primarily because of two factors  the cost of transportation from the Pantnagar plant of Tata Motors and the high road tax and registration rates in the state, explained a dealer.         
	On-road price includes ex-showroom price, registration and road tax, car insurance and some other minor components that vary across states.         
	The difference in ex-showroom prices  that includes ex-factory price, value-added tax and cost of transportation  between Delhi and Calcutta reflects the premium a customer here is paying because of the transportation bill. VAT rates are the same in Bengal and Delhi at 12.5 per cent.        
	On paper, the cost of transportation differential between Delhi and Calcutta is Rs 7,420. But had the plant remained in Singur, the savings for a Calcutta customer would have been much more, said an automobile industry expert.         
	The distance between the Pantnagar plant and Delhi is around 250km while it is 1,500km to Calcutta. The cost of bringing a car from Singur to Calcutta would have been far less as the distance is only around 40km.        
	We have lost the project, we are paying more for the cars. The shifting of the plant from Singur is costing us dear in all ways, said Palash Mukherjee, a resident of Singur.        
	Mukherjee, whose family willingly gave a three-bigha plot for the project, took a train to the city this morning to catch a glimpse of the Nano and collect a booking form.         
	I couldnt hold back my tears when I first touched the Nano. Its a lovely car. Its a dream come true, but the dream isnt ours any more, said Mukherjee.         
	If the fallout of the Singur protest on the car bill is limited to the Nano, the high tax affects all brands. The road tax and registration rates in Calcutta are among the highest in the country, said an automobile dealer.

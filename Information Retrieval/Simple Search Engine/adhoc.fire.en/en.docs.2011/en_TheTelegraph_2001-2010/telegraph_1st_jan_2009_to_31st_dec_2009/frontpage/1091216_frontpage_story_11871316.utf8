                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                Mob fury on pig-heart unit
          A STAFF REPORTER                                          Dhaniram Baruah      
	Guwahati, Dec. 15: The severed heads of two young boys that a stray dog brought in led to an arson attack today on the institute of pig-heart doctor Dhaniram Baruah in Sonapur, 40km from here.        
	The mob torched a part of Baruahs hill-top Heart City and damaged at least four vehicles, suspecting the controversial surgeon of having killed the local boys for some sinister medical experiment or organ racket.        
	Baruah, who was away in Bangalore, told The Telegraph it was an attempt to frame him by police, whom he accused of deliberately allowing the mob attack.        
	The doctor, a pioneering researcher according to some, was accused of fraud by the Assam medical fraternity after he claimed to have successfully transplanted a pigs heart into a dying patient in 1997. He was arrested and his institute partially burnt down in an attack, which he accused the then Prafulla Mahanta government of orchestrating.        
	The roots of todays incident lay in Saturday nights murder of six people  three children, their parents and a cousin  in Jogdol village neighbouring Heart City. The bodies of Atul, 9, and Tukul, 6, had been decapitated.        
	This morning, a dog wandered into the village with a boys head held in its jaws. The childs eyes, ears and lower teeth were missing. Neighbours claimed the head was Atuls and informed the police.        
	A sniffer dog then allegedly followed the trail to the boundary wall of Baruahs institute. In the afternoon, the stray dog brought in another childs head, with the ears missing, which the villagers claimed was Tukuls. A mob then set fire to a part of Heart City. Fire tenders took nearly an hour to control the blaze.        
	The police called for reinforcements and later took six of Baruahs employees and 10 villagers into custody. An officer alleged the heads may have been preserved in some chemical solution because there was little sign of decomposition. Both the heads have been sent for forensic tests.        
	In 1997, when Baruahs patient Purna Saikia, 32, died seven days after the alleged transplant, the doctor was sent to judicial custody for 45 days on the charge of violating transplantation laws. The verdict is pending.

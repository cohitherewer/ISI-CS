The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Match fixed, Sania game for tennis
                                                                                                           Match fixed, Sania game for tennis
          OUR BUREAU                            Sania Mirza                                 
	Hyderabad, May 29: Sania Mirzas fans need not be too heartbroken at the news of her impending engagement  they will continue to see her on the tennis court.        
	The 22-year-old, though, may take a short break after the July 10 betrothal, which comes six days after the Wimbledon ladies final.        
	Her father Imran Mirza issued a media release today denying reports that Sania would quit tennis.        
	Sania Mirza is engaged to Mr Muhammad Sohrab Mirza, whose family hails from the city of Hyderabad. Although not related, the two families have had friendly ties for several decades. However, the wedding is not expected to take place for a while, the release said.        
	The news appearing in certain sections of the media about the two maternal grandmothers having fixed the liaison is baseless. It has also been wrongly projected that Sania is contemplating early retirement from tennis.        
	A family member said that after the ceremony, Sania may follow Sohrab, a childhood friend, to Britain where he will be studying for an MBA. They may stay in Britain for a while since Sania too needs a break, the relative said.        
	The media today descended on Sohrabs home in the citys Anandnagar locality. The young man, described as a bit shy, drove out in an Audi with tinted windshields for the Friday prayers and covered his face when photographers tried to click him.        
	Sania and Sohrab had both studied at Hyderabads Naser School. Sohrab, who did his BCom from St Marys College here, is said to have been doting on Sania for the past few years. He has been at her side to comfort her over her losses on the court. Sources said Sohrab was also at Apollo Hospital when she had a knee operation two years ago.        
	We knew Sania and Sohrab were going steady. Sohrab even accompanied her during the Dubai Open early this year, said Mohammed Basheer, a former classmate of Sohrab at St Marys.        
	The engagement will take place at Chow Mohalla Palace, one of the Nizams palaces.

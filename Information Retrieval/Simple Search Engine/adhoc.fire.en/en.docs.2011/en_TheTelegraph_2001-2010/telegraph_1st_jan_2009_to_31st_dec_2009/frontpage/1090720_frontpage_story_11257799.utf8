	Ranchi, July 19: Jharkhands new Governor Kateekal Sankaranarayanan is likely to assume charge on July 25.        
	According to a Raj Bhavan spokesperson, Sankaranarayanan will arrive at the state on July 24, the same day when Governor Syed Sibtey Razi bids his goodbye to Jharkhand and assumes the charge of Assam from July 25.         
	Sankaranarayanan was shifted to Jharkhand from Nagaland. A veteran Congressman from Kerala, Sankarnarayanan was sworn in as the governor of Nagaland on February 3, 2007. He was also asked to assume the additional charge of Arunachal Pradesh for some time.         
	Born in 1932, Sankaranarayanan served in governments headed by K. Karunakaran in 1977 and A.K. Antony in 2001. He held the portfolios for finance and agriculture in the state cabinet.         
	He served for long as the convenor of the UDF coalition, led by the Congress. After the party split in 1969, Sankaranarayanan has been a frontline Congress leader in his state.         
	Meanwhile, JMM Rajya Sabha MP Hemant Soren met Sankarnarayanan in New Delhi today and apprised him about the states political scenario. JMM chief Shibu Soren also congratulated the new governor over phone and hoped that the state would get to wriggle out of anarchy under his stewardship.

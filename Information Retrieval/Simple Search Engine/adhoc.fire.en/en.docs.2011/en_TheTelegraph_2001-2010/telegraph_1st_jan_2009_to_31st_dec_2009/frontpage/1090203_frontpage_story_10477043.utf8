The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Bangla dossier on Pranab trip
                                                                                                           Bangla dossier on Pranab trip
  - Govt to give details on rebel camps        A STAFF REPORTER                                          
	Guwahati, Feb. 2: Dispur will soon hand over a dossier of militants operating from Bangladesh to external affairs minister Pranab Mukherjee to mount pressure on the neighbouring country to flush out the Assam-based insurgent groups taking shelter in that country.         
	Chief minister Tarun Gogoi today said he had told Mukherjee that unless Ulfa and the NDFB were uprooted from their bases in Bangla-desh, it would be difficult to contain terrorism in the state as the groups were being backed by Huji and the ISI.         
	The two groups jointly have 16 camps in various parts of Bangladesh, including in Dhaka. Of these, five were major camps, the chief minister said.         
	Gogoi said at least 10 top Ulfa leaders and renegade NDFB chief Ranjan Daimary were currently in Bangladesh. He said both Mukherjee and Union home minister P. Chidambaram were serious about dealing with the twin problems of infiltration and terrorism inflicting the state. He said there were indica-tions that the new regime in Bangladesh would take a firm stand against terrorists.         
	Stating that the Centre was taking a tough stand even with outfits now in ceasefire, Gogoi said it would respond to truce offers only from militant groups which agree to abide by the new ground rules.         
	According to the new ground rules, the militants will have to surrender their arms and stay in designated camps.         
	Speaking at a news conference, Gogoi said the ceasefire with the NDFB was extended only after it agreed to the new truce terms and the same would apply to the UPDS, awaiting a decision on the extension of the ceasefire, which expired recently. He said the pro-talks NDFB, which is in a ceasefire, has 678 cadres in the designated camps.         
	Dwelling on political issues, Gogoi, in an attempt to discourage serving bureaucrats from aspiring for Congress tickets in the Lok Sabha elections, said those who have resigned to seek party tickets have very little chance of getting the nomination.         
	State election commissioner C.K. Sarma yesterday applied for a Congress ticket from Mangaldoi parliamentary constituency, a day after he resigned from his post.         
	Gogoi, however, encouraged the mad rush in the party for Lok Sabha tickets. I have never seen such excitement among the Congress workers for Lok Sabha elections. Already 126 people have applied for party tickets from 14 constituencies, he said.         
	Gogoi said he was personally in favour of giving younger leaders a chance. On the Congresss alliance with the Bodoland Peoples Front (BPF), he said the party would take a decision after making an assessment of the partys ability in the constituencies where the BPF, too, wanted to put up its candidates.         
	He said if need be, there would be friendly contests with the BPF in those seats. Apart from Kokrajhar, the BPF will field a candidate in Mangaldoi.

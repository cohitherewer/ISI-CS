          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Bhubaneswar, Feb. 22: A university to be built by the Institute of Chartered Financial Analysts of India (Icfai) would be the first-of-its-kind initiative in the state with the cabinet clearing the draft legislation almost three years after the MoU was signed.        
	According to the existing law, only government-run universities are allowed to be set up in the state. Officials of Icfai said that the draft bill had been cleared at the cabinet meeting on February 1.        
	Earlier, there were reports that the cabinet had deferred the matter to the next meeting to re-examine the draft bill.        
	Icfai had signed an MoU with the state government on March 20, 2007, to set up the university. The institute of higher learning, with a total investment of Rs 150 crore, was supposed to be completed within three years of signing the MoU.        
	However, we had problems with land acquisition near Jatni, resulting in the delay We have now identified a fresh patch of 50 acres between Bhubaneswar and Khurda, said Samad Noorus, the Icfai official in charge of Orissa.        
	The university proposes to admit 1,000 students in various disciplines, including engineering and management studies. Icfai would buy its own land for the institute, which would house a sports complex, recreational facilities and utility centres. We have not asked for funding help from the government. We just expect the government to help us frame the legislation, said Noorus        
	Icfai has sponsored universities in different states under respective legislation. Uttaranchal, Tripura, Sikkim, Mizoram, Meghalaya, Nagaland and Jharkhand have passed bills facilitating the establishment of Icfai universities in their respective states. Chhattisgarh, Punjab, Himachal Pradesh and Rajasthan have already issued letters of intent to the university in their states. The university would develop necessary human resources required in the wake of IT, ITES, BPO and KPO centres that generate avenues for employment to local youths, said Noorus.

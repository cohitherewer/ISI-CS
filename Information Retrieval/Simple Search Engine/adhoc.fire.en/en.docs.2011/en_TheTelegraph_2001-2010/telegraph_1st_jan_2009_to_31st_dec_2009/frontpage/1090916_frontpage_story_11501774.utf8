The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | The Patrick I met in Calcutta
                                                                                                           The Patrick I met in Calcutta
  - Dirty Dancing star who acted in City of Joy is dead                                Swayze shooting for City of Joy in Bhowanipore                                   
	Nandita C. Puri, a Calcutta-born author and columnist married to veteran actor Om Puri, recalls her association with Patrick Swayze, the Dirty Dancing star who died on Monday in Los Angeles.              
	Year: 1991. Location: Calcutta. Setting: Roland Joffes City of Joy.        
	As a cub reporter (with The Telegraph) I was assigned to do a feature on Om Puri (who played Hasari Pal the rickshaw-puller) and Shabana Azmi (who played his wife Kamla).        
	I was disillusioned because I wasnt assigned to interview Patrick Swayze, who was then fresh from his Dirty Dancing and Ghost glory! I thought I had missed out on a lifetimes opportunity of rubbing shoulders with a Hollywood celebrity.        
	But fate had in store other things for me. When I did eventually meet up with Patrick a few times during the City of Joy days, he seemed a fun person. My first impression of him was his utter humility.        
	He was a practising Buddhist and India fascinated him. During some of the informal cast parties at the Oberoi Grand, Patrick would enjoy a laugh but yet there was something more deep, more calm about him than his merely shaking a leg. That is what everyone expected of him then. He seemed to be part of the merry crowd and yet he was not quite there.        
	During the filming of City of Joy, he and Om Puri (who was later to become my husband) struck up a deep friendship.         
	Later that year during a media conference in Australia, Om remembered Patrick saying about his performance, If anyone deserves an Oscar this year, it has to be Om. Such was his magnanimity towards his co-stars.        
	Although Om and Patrick were not in touch on a regular basis, a certain deep bond was still there. This I realised when I spoke to him last about a year and a half ago. I was interviewing him for Oms biography that I was working on (which is releasing this November).        
	Patrick very kindly consented to write the foreword and said: I am looking forward to reading it. I hope it will be out soon.        
	Those words were ominous, because both of us knew he was terminally ill and was living on borrowed time without any of us spelling it out loud.        
	I told him to release the book in New York and he agreed more than happily.        
	Patricks foreword was not merely a foreword. It is a mini philosophy. He said his first impression of Om was intimidating as Om reminded him of his father. And later they developed a brotherly bond and he still considered Om like a brother. Om feels the same way and was really touched that someone of Patricks stature would remember every little detail of his Calcutta sojourn so many years ago.        
	The line from the foreword which haunts me the most is when Patrick writes, When I first visited Mother Teresas Home For The Dying, I suddenly realised that we (in the West) live in such a bubble. I wasnt sure whether it was the dying to be pitied or me. I went back a changed person.        
	That was Patrick Swayze.        
	We knew he was ailing. We wished for his recovery. I wished he would be able to read my book.         
	In fact, I was planning to send him the book even before it hit the stores. Unfortunately it was not to be. All we can wish is that God give strength to his family.        
	Not often do we come across men like Patrick. Good-looking, talented, a terrific dancer above all, a good human being.

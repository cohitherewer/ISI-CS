The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | CPM duo sound out Trinamul on meets
                                                                                                           CPM duo sound out Trinamul on meets
          BARUN GHOSH                              
	Calcutta, Sept. 27: Two CPM ministers are in touch with Trinamul Congress leaders in an attempt to persuade them to attend programmes sponsored by the Left Front government next month.        
	The initiative has been launched after central minister Mukul Roy walked out of a business chambers meeting last week because of the presence of CPM ministers. Roy had then said the boycott would be confined to private programmes but the two CPM ministers do not appear to be willing to take any chances, probably because of the mercurial nature of the Trinamul leadership.        
	State panchayat minister Anisur Rahman and housing minister Gautam Deb have sounded out Trinamul leaders about participation in a seminar on rural organisations and a stone-laying programme for housing for the poor.        
	Both topics are close to Mamata Banerjees heart but sources said that so far, they had not spotted any indication that she would allow her colleagues to attend the programmes.        
	But Deb, who is organising the foundation-laying programme, has not only refused to give up but is pitching his aim high. I have already established contact with some Trinamul leaders so that I can personally invite Mamata to the foundation-laying ceremony next month, Deb said this afternoon.        
	Union finance minister Pranab Mukherjee is expected to attend the event to start the construction of over 2,000 houses for the poor in Rajarhats New Town  an area in the news recently for an alleged unholy nexus among politicians, promoters and land sharks.        
	Deb was instrumental in setting up a meeting between Mamata and Jyoti Basu to discuss the land acquisition controversy in Singur.        
	Panchayat minister Rahman has spoken to Partha Chatterjee, Trinamul MLA and leader of the Opposition, on the seminar.        
	Convinced that politics wont stand in the way of serving the states interest, I am inviting Partha Chatterjee and Congress legislature party chief Manas Bhunia to the seminar on more effective functioning of rural bodies across the state, Rahman said.         
	The minister claimed that he had got a favourable response from Chatterjee when he had called on him in his Assembly chamber two months ago to discuss problems over reservation of key posts in panchayats.        
	 Chatterjee said Rahman had met him at the Assembly chamber. We want to work together for the states development. But my participation in any seminar or in government-sponsored programmes has to have the go-ahead from Mamata, he added.        
	Some Trinamul leaders do feel that continuous boycott can backfire if the party comes to power in 2011.         
	The CPM will definitely launch a more virulent form of non-co-operation then, a Trinamul functionary said, though he conceded that few in the party would dare reason with Mamata using that logic.

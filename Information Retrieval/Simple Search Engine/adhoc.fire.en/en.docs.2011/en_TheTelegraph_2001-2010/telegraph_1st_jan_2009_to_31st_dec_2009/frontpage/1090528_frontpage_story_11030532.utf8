The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Almost over? Not incompetence   Why power took its time
                                                                                                           Almost over? Not incompetence 
  Why power took its time          SUVRO ROY AND OUR BUREAU                                                    
	Calcutta, May 27: Now that it is almost over, wisdom has dawned on the Bengal administration.        
	Had the state called for help from where it was available within earshot, Naktala Lane need not have suffered 60 hours of power cut. Or 1.5 lakh households in several places in Calcutta for that matter.        
	Bengal chief secretary Asok Mohan Chakrabarti this evening conceded that the army would have done the job of restoring power supply more expeditiously.         
	The chief executive of the administration added in the next breath: But now it is almost over.        
	It  the power crisis that soon triggered a nerve-wracking water shortage  was hardly over for many Calcuttans even 60 hours after the first winds of Cyclone Aila slammed into the city on Monday morning.         
	Officially, 80 per cent of power supply was restored by this evening. But the remaining 20 per cent translates into a large number in a city with Calcuttas population. In the south, parts of Jodhpur Park and adjoining areas, Bansdroni, Nayabandh, Ajoynagar, Patuli, Baishnabghata, Garia and Kasba were without power. In the north, Dunlop, stretches between Baguiati and the airport and Baranagar continued to be crippled.         
	It need not have been so, not with a force called the army camping in Calcutta.        
	Back-of-the-envelope estimates culled from different sources suggest that lack of manpower was the biggest factor that contributed to the delay in restoring power supply.        
	For repairing faults, CESC  the power supply company  has 1,700 workers. They were divided into 200 teams that were assigned the task of disentangling cables from fallen trees, replacing or slipping back into place uprooted power poles and restoring electricity supply.        
	CESC officials said the number was not adequate in the face of a natural calamity. To handle a natural calamity of this dimension, even 3,000 workers could not have restored power supply in a day. Also, it was not possible for us to recruit men to increase the workforce as this is a specialised and highly technical job, a CESC official said.        
	CESC officials said repair was required at 6,000 points. This means that electric poles were uprooted and overhead wires on main roads as well as lanes and bylanes snapped at 6,000 places. Of these, 1,000 wires snapped on main roads and 200 poles were uprooted. Repair could be started only after the trees were removed by the CMC.        
	However, no one thought of the army based in Fort William, not too far from Writers Buildings.        
	An army spokesperson said that had the force been approached, it could have made a difference. But there are two sides to it. We are equipped to deal with situations where bulldozers and cranes are involved, not where trees have to be cut with saws. But we are a disciplined force and would definitely have done the work much expeditiously, he said.                
	Chief secretary Chakrabarti said he thought that civilian agencies would be enough, although the mayor had not wasted any opportunity to underscore the unprecedented situation to defend the civic bodys ill-equipped response to the cyclone aftermath.        
	We thought that the police, the civic authorities and the civil defence people would be enough to tackle the crisis. But I agree that the army would have done the job more expeditiously. But now it is almost over, Chakrabarti said this evening.        
	The bureaucracy may have been found wanting on thinking on their feet. But in another department, it cannot be found guilty of similar omission: red tape.        
	Power technicians are allowed to cut only twigs, not thick branches which are the sole domain of the Calcutta Municipal Corporation (CMC). The rule was put in place to ensure that trees are not cut by unauthorised persons.        
	But between Monday evening and Wednesday evening, some citizens complained that CESC teams refused to disentangle wires that got wound around tree parts that could be called twigs or branches, depending on which side the adjudicator is standing.         
	If there are twigs or thin branches entangled with our wires, we hack them away. But our workers cant cut thick branches or trees, even if they are uprooted, because they belong to the CMC, a CESC official said.        
	CMC officials said all trees on the roads they maintain (98 per cent in the city) belong to them and permission has to be sought before cutting a tree.        
	Asked whether such a rule could not have been suspended till the crisis was tackled, chief secretary Chakrabarti said it could have been done by the government in an emergency.         
	I know that this has been a problem and made the process cumbersome, but CESC did not approach us with such a proposal, Chakrabarti said. Anyway, now almost all the work is done.        
	A CESC official said: We do not have the infrastructure to cut so many trees with saws. So we made no such proposal.

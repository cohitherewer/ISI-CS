The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Dispur to buy land for riot-hit
                                                                                                           Dispur to buy land for riot-hit
          A STAFF REPORTER                                    
	Guwahati, Feb. 7: The Assam government has decided to buy around 4,000 bighas of land across the state to rehabilitate the riot victims of 1996 and 1998, who are living in the relief camps of Bongaigaon and Kokrajhar districts.         
	The move was necessitated after earlier initiatives at rehabilitation hit a roadblock because of strong objections from local groups and non-availability of suitable government land.        
	A senior official of the revenue department said since the government wanted to make a headway in rehabilitating the victims, buying land from private parties was apparently the only alternative.         
	Since the government cannot buy land on its own, it has decided to acquire plots from willing sellers through an organisation, the Society for Rehabilitation of Violence-affected Families. The society will issue advertisements, seeking offer for sale of land.        
	The executive council of the society, headed by revenue minister Bhumidhar Barman, today said it had decided to allot a plot measuring one katha and five lecha to each of the affected families. Altogether 12,000 families have to be rehabilitated.         
	V.K. Pipersenia, the principal secretary of the revenue and disaster management department, is guiding the exercise to its logical end, the official said.        
	Since these plots will be scattered across the state, there should be no complaints and we will be buying the plots from willing sellers. We will issue an advertisement, seeking to buy plots, very soon and wrap up the process within a month, the official said.         
	The government has sanctioned Rs 50 crore for the purpose, he added.         
	We will discuss the offer with the victims representatives, who are also part of the society, along with the deputy commissioners of the affected districts. It is a unique concept and we have managed to get the clearance from the Centre. Since nothing much was happening despite our best efforts, we are seriously exploring this option, he said.         
	The council has approved the contents of the draft advertisement calling for offers to sell land.        
	Besides waiting for offers from private parties, Dispur will also explore the possibility of using government land and plots of closed public sector undertakings and co-operative societies. It will also look into the previous proposal of rehabiliting affected families on government land, besides initiating steps to expedite the cases pending in courts to rehabilitate some of the affected families on the plots involved in these cases.        
	Sources said the revenue minister had made it clear that any opposition to the rehabilitation of the affected families in any area would be firmly dealt with.         
	Any claim for rehabilitation by anybody other than the recorded inmates will be verified and the general council of the society, headed by the chief minister, will take appropriate action on such claims.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Govt faces smoke warning query
                                                                                                           Govt faces smoke warning query
          SAMANWAYA RAUTRAY                                              
	New Delhi, May 5: The Supreme Court today asked the government why the proposed pictorial warnings on both sides of a cigarette packet had been diluted to one side amid allegations that the scorpion sign may not even see light of day.        
	What is the need for change? What has prompted the government to change it? a two-judge bench asked additional solicitor general Gopal Subramanium, brushing aside his plea not to intervene for the time being.        
	The quiz came two days after a government notification reduced by half the size of the proposed warnings  an image of a scorpion or human lungs instead of skull and crossbones as had been initially proposed  on packets of tobacco products.        
	The health ministry notification said the warnings, to be introduced from May 31, should occupy 40 per cent of the front panel of packets, altering earlier rules that had ordered warnings on 40 per cent of both the front and back panels.        
	Former health minister Anbumani Ramadoss, who had pushed for graphic warnings about the ill-effects of smoking, had chaired a meeting of a Group of Ministers in February where it was agreed that the rules should have provisions for warnings on both sides.         
	But the amended rules, conveyed to the health ministry, were watered down severely, contrary to what the GoM had cleared.        
	The court sought records of the GoM meeting after the counsel for NGO Health for Millions argued that the rules could not be changed after they had been cleared.        
	The NGO said the government had earlier promised the court it would implement the rules from March 17, 2008, then delayed it twice to November 2008 and May 2009.        
	The counsel said her client was apprehensive that the government would not implement the rules even from May under pressure from the tobacco lobby.        
	The NGO also wanted the apex court to tell the government to ensure that all cigarette pouches display the content of nicotine and tar, the two key ingredients reportedly responsible for causing cancer.        
	Subramanium defended the changed rules, saying a start was being made. The new rules should be allowed to go into effect. Whatever changes could be done later, he said, urging the court not to intervene now.        
	But the bench did not seem satisfied with the response and asked the government to produce the minutes of the GoM meeting by tomorrow.        
	The court also sought data from the health ministry for the period 2003-2009 about the consequences of smoking on citizens.

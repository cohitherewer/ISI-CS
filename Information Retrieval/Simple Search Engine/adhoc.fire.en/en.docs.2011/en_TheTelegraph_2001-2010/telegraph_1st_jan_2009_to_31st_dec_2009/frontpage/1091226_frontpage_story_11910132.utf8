          SANJAY K. JHA                              
	New Delhi, Dec. 25: The Congress leaderships stubborn opposition to Shibu Sorens appointment as the next chief minister is linked to the partys long-term political planning in both Jharkhand and the neighbouring Bihar where it feels it will gain enormously even if the JMM succeeds in forming a government with BJP support.        
	Though the party high command called its MLAs and ally Babulal Marandi to Delhi today to discuss the next course of action, there was no sense of urgency to manage the required numbers.         
	Senior leaders said the party would demonstrate no desperation either in pressuring Soren to fall in line or to win over Independents and the RJD. While Soren affects the partys long-term plans in Jharkhand, any association with Lalu Prasad would hamper its revival plan in Bihar.        
	The best outcome for us will be a BJP-JMM government, a leader said, taking a lighter view of the Congresss predicament.         
	Our party organisation was in a total mess in Jharkhand but we have gained because of our decision not to align with the JMM. Non-tribal voters (read Bihari voters) get alienated by the very possibility of seeing Soren as chief minister. Soren was our ally and we disentangled ourselves with great difficulty. We dont want to fall into that trap again.        
	The Congress believed the BJP would damage its prospects in both Jharkhand and Bihar by propping up Soren. The BJP commands the support of a majority of non-tribal voters in Jharkhand and won eight of the 14 Lok Sabha seats in the state in the May general elections.        
	The Congress has been planning for the 2014 general elections when Rahul Gandhi will be at the forefront of its campaign, and it will run the risk of losing Jharkhand now to the BJP for reaping a richer harvest in the two states five years later. By backing Marandi instead of Soren, the Congress also hopes to wash off the stains it got during the Madhu Koda regime.         
	Party spokesperson Shakeel Ahmed said: Our intention is to provide a clean and stable government in the state. Jharkhand has suffered a lot and we all should understand the need for good governance. We hope Shibu Sorenji will see the rationale in our approach and agree to support it. Asked if the party was determined not to take Lalus support, Ahmed said: We dont need anybodys support if the JMM agrees to our proposal. But if some party extends support on its own, what can we do.                                
	This makes it clear that the Congress was appealing to the JMM, but not the RJD for support. Ahmed, who agreed that the partys policy in Bihar was to maintain a distance from the RJD, however, refused to categorically rule out the possibility of taking Lalus help in Jharkhand.        
	Other leaders admitted in private that the party should not under any circumstances allow Lalu to create a space for himself in the UPA. We have to present ourselves as the true alternative in Bihar. Nitish Kumar will paint us black if we have any truck with Lalu in Jharkhand. We will undo all the gains of the last Lok Sabha election. We should wait for Soren to yield or allow him to go with the BJP. If that doesnt happen, let President rule continue for a while, another leader from Bihar said.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Ranchi, Oct. 21: Union home minister P. Chidambaram arrived in Ranchi today for a meeting he will chair tomorrow to review the overall law and order situation in the state.         
	The home ministers late night arrival and the meeting have sent state officials and politicians into a tizzy. Tomorrows meeting will reportedly discuss dissolution of the Assembly.        
	The ministers visit confirms speculation that the Election Commission will announce the poll schedule soon. The Centre had assured the Supreme Court that it would notify election dates by November 8.        
	Incidentally, state officials are tight-lipped about the Union home ministers agenda. Chidambaram had reviewed development schemes and the law and order scenario in the state on September 25.         
	Chidambaram will be reviewing development programmes as well as the states preparedness for dealing with anti-Naxalite operations. He will also address the media, said a top official.

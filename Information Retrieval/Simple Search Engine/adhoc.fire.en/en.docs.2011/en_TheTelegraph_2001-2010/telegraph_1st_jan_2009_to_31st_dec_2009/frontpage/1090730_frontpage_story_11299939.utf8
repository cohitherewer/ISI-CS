The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Operation Topple Google,   rebooted 
                                                                                                           Operation Topple Google,   rebooted 
                            Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer, (right) Yahoo CEO Carol Bartz				                                 
	San Francisco, July 29: Microsoft and Yahoo have finally teamed up in an attempt to ding Google with Bing, re-igniting a technology blood feud that pits the Number One against the rest.        
	Microsoft and Yahoo today announced a partnership in Internet search and advertising that is intended to create a stronger rival to industry powerhouse Google.        
	The pact is a measured step that represents a pragmatic division of duties between the two companies, instead of the blockbuster deal Microsoft initiated last year, when it bid $47.5 billion to buy Yahoo. That hostile offer was ultimately withdrawn by Microsoft, and its collapse led to a management change at Yahoo and the replacement of its co-founder Jerry Yang with an outsider, Carol Bartz, in the chief executive role.        
	Under the new pact, Microsoft will provide the underlying search technol- ogy on Yahoos popular websites.         
	The deal will give a lift to Microsofts search engine, which it recently overhauled and renamed Bing.                     
	Bing, which tries to put search results in better context than rivals, has won praise and favourable reviews, after Microsoft spent years falling further and further behind Google in search.        
	With the addition of Yahoos users, Microsoft will be able to run more searches through the Bing technology infrastructure. It expects to deliver better answers to search queries over time as well, by learning from more peoples queries.        
	For Yahoo, the move furthers the strategy under Bartz to focus the company on its strengths as a producer of Web media sites, from finance to sports, as a marketer and as a leader in online display advertising.        
	Even with Yahoos help, Microsoft has its work cut out. Combined, Microsoft and Yahoo handle 28 per cent of the Internet searches in the US, well behind Googles 65 per cent. Google is even more dominant in the rest of the world, with a global share of 67 per cent compared to a combined 11 per cent for Microsoft and Yahoo.        
	Throughout a morning conference call and the later interviews, Yahoos Bartz and Microsoft chief executive Steven A. Ballmer emphasised that combining the No. 2 and No. 3 companies would not harm competition but enhance it.        
	Google was rarely mentioned by name, but it was the subtext of the conversation and the deal itself. The partnership, Ballmer said, would create a really strong No. 2 player in search and search advertising. He added: Advertisers and publishers will get a competitive alternative.        
	Microsoft and Yahoo said they expected resistance to the deal from Google.        
	In a brief statement, Google said: There has traditionally been a lot of competition online, and our experience is that competition brings about great things for users. Were interested to learn more about the deal.        
	The terms of the 10-year agreement call for Microsoft to license some of Yahoos search technologies. Yahoo will receive a lucrative 88 per cent of the search-generated ad revenue from its own sites for the first five years of the deal. That is a very high rate. Rates vary, but percentages in the 60s are more typical.        
	If the deal is completed next year as planned, and after the partnership is fully in place in three years, Yahoo estimates that its operating income will increase by $500 million a year, based on the anticipated higher search traffic and ad revenue generated. By handing over the costly technical chores of maintaining and improving search technology to Microsoft, Yahoo estimates it will save about $200 million a year in expenses.        
	Microsofts Ballmer said in an interview that Bartz had driven a hard bargain. Look, he said, she got 88 per cent of the revenue and none of the cost.        
	Still, Ballmer added that his team at Microsoft got something it badly wanted as well: I got an opportunity to swing for the fences in search.

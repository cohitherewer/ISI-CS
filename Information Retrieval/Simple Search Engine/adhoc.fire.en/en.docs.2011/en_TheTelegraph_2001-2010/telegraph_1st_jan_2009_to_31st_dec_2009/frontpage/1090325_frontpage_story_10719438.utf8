          ROB STEIN                            High-risk recipe                                  
	Washington, March 24: Eating red meat increases the chances of dying prematurely, according to the first large study to examine whether regularly eating beef or pork increases mortality.         
	The study of more than 500,000 middle-aged and elderly Americans found that those who consumed about four ounces of red meat a day (the equivalent of about a small hamburger) were more than 30 per cent more likely to die during the 10 years they were followed, mostly from heart disease.         
	Sausage, cold cuts and other processed meats also increased the risk. Previous research had found a link between red meat and an increased risk of heart disease and cancer, particularly colorectal cancer, but the new study is the first large examination of the relationship between eating meat and overall risk of death, and is by far the most detailed.         
	The bottom line is we found an association between red meat and processed meat and an increased risk of mortality, said Rashmi Sinha of the National Cancer Institute, who led the study published yesterday in the of Internal Medicine. In contrast, routine consumption of fish, chicken, turkey and other poultry decreased the risk of death by a small amount.         
	There are many explanations for how red meat might be unhealthy:         
	 Cooking red meat generates cancer-causing compounds;        
	 Red meat is also high in saturated fat, which has been associated with breast and colorectal cancer; and         
	 Meat is high in iron, also believed to promote cancer.         
	People who eat red meat are more likely to have high blood pressure and cholesterol, which increases the risk of heart disease.

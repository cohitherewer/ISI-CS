          SUDHIR KUMAR MISHRA                              
	Ranchi, Feb. 22: The state government today agreed to implement in toto the recommendations of the Sixth Pay Commission. A formal decision to this effect was taken by the governors advisory council.        
	Now, state employees will get the revised central pay scale with effect from January 1, 2006. Their arrears accumulated since September 2008 would be paid along with their salary for February 2009.        
	It has also agreed to give 40 per cent of the arrears amount accumulated between April 1, 2007, and August 1, 2008, during this fiscal and the rest 60 per cent in the next financial year. The arrears accumulated between January 1, 2006, and April 1, 2007, will be paid in two equal instalments in 2010-11 and 2011-12, respectively.        
	For the settlement of disputes, if any, a high-powered committee headed by a member of the revenue board has been constituted. The state finance secretary and secretaries of the departments concerned would be the members of this committee.        
	Soon after the creation of Jharkhand, state government employees were granted central pay scales. The government, too, had agreed to implement the recommendations of central pay commissions.        
	However, when the Sixth Pay Commission was announced, the state government budged slightly from its previous stand. Though it agreed in principle to grant them the revised wages effective since January 1, 2006, the actual benefits were to be given from April 1, 2007.        
	Among other things, the state government has adopted the Centres juvenile justice law. It has also decided to pay uniform allowances in cash to forest guards and rangers. Forest guards will, henceforth, get Rs 3,000 per annum and rangers Rs 3,500.        
	For speedy disposal of disputes under the electricity law, the special courts in Ranchi, Jamshedpur, Hazaribagh, Dhanbad, Dumka and Medininagar (Daltonganj) would now be headed by additional district judge rank officials. The advisory council today sanctioned these posts.        
	In the Jharkhand State Rural Development Authority, 33 posts have been created. Its chief executive officer will now be a secretary-rank official. So long, this position was being held by retired persons.        
	The Administrative Staff College in Hyderabad would be the consultant for preparing the action plan for the implementation of the JNNURM schemes and model municipal law. A consultancy fee of Rs 5.54 lakh would be payable for preparing the action plan and other Rs 9.91 lakh for the model municipal law.         
	To evolve modalities to improve revenue earnings for municipalities, National Institute of Business and Finance has been made consultant for a fee of Rs 25 lakh.

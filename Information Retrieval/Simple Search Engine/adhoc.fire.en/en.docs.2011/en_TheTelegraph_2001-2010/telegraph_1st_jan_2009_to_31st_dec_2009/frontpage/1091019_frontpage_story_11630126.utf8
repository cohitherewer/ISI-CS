                                                                                                           Rhino killers shot after Assam hunt 
          A STAFF REPORTER                             The Rajiv Gandhi Orang National Park in Assam                                  
	Guwahati, Oct. 18: Two poachers were shot dead in a fierce gun battle inside Assams Rajiv Gandhi Orang National Park last night but not before they had killed a female rhino and chopped off its horn.        
	This was the sixth rhino killed this year at the 78.81sqkm park spread over Sonitpur and Darrang districts.         
	The horn was later recovered from a bag found on one of the slain poachers, Harmoj Ali, a dreaded local criminal who was involved in killing rhinos earlier at Orang and at Kaziranga National Park. The other poacher shot dead is yet to be identified.         
	Orang divisional forest officer Sushil Daila said there were three poachers in the group but one fled under cover of thick fog and darkness.        
	The official said the rangers at Orang, 140km from Guwahati, had anticipated such an attempt by poachers on Diwali night, when its difficult to distinguish gunshots from crackers. We had been alert for the last couple of days and our guards were keeping vigil, Daila said.         
	The gun battle, one of the fiercest at the park, continued for over half an hour in pitch darkness close to midnight. More than 30 rounds were fired by the guards. Two empty cartridges and a live bullet of a .303 rifle, two bags containing food, a bottle of country liquor and the rhino horn were found on the site of the shootout. A blood-soaked axe, used to chop off the horn, was also seized.        
	A forest patrol heard gunshots around 10.45pm but it took almost 15 minutes to zero in on the exact location from where the shots were being fired.        
	Our guards followed the gunshots and saw a beam of torchlight. By then, the poachers had already gouged out the horn from the rhino and were about to flee, Daila said.         
	The rangers ordered the poachers to stop, unsure who they were. The guards were fired upon, which made it clear the intruders were poachers. The gun battle continued for over half an hour, the official said.         
	Ali, the slain poacher, had been arrested several times under the wildlife act and the Arms Act, the official said. On June 28, he was involved in the killing of a female rhino at Orang. He was arrested the following day from a Dimapur-bound bus along with Pawkhan Thorang, a sharpshooter from Manipur.        
	During a raid on Alis residence soon after, a US-made pistol, a 12-bore rifle and ammunition were recovered. He, however, jumped bail.

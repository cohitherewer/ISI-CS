  - Brown and Singh swap favours at G20 summit          AMIT ROY                            Singh with Brown during the G20 summit. (AP)                                        
	London, April 3: Gordon Brown did very old friend Manmohan Singh a favour  and vice versa.        
	At the working dinner for G20 leaders that the British Prime Minister hosted at 10 Downing Street, Brown asked President Barack Obama to speak. Then Brown asked one other person to speak: Singh, whom the British Prime Minister had described as a very old friend.        
	Singh is not given to boasting. But at the news conference in London last evening  the Prime Minister was in a slightly irritable mood when he admonished one journalist: One question at a time, I cant handle three questions at a time  the Indian Prime Minister revealed Brown had asked him to do the honours.        
	Singh allowed himself the faint trace of a dry joke when asked why the G20 communiqu mirrored so much of what he had said in his Downing Street speech. He had just got his oar in early, the Prime Minister indicated.        
	I was given the chance last night by Prime Minister Gordon Brown  first President Obama spoke, then he (Brown) asked me to speak, explained Singh. The agreement was that if you speak at the dinner, you will not speak in the plenary (session). So I got a chance to speak early enough and I thought I should have my say so that it could reach the gentlemen of the press in time.        
	There was an appreciative titter from the 40-strong Indian media corps.        
	By getting Singh, an independent voice, to say everything Brown wanted in the communiqu, both Prime Ministers seemed to pull a fast one on the others.        
	The Indian Prime Minister did not seem all that happy, though, with the IMF. All these years there has been excessive surveillance of the developing countries economy (by the IMF)  the real imbalance in the functioning of the IMF has been there has been too little surveillance of the affairs of the developed countries.        
	Singh added: We know the present crisis does not originate in the periphery in Asia or in Latin America. It originates in the heart of capitalism. Part of the blame must be shared by the IMF.        
	He said Indias reserves amounted to about $250billion and that India has no intention of going to the IMF.        
	As to what India had gained from the summit, Singh summed up: The fact that India is now accepted as a major player on the world economic scene itself is a great achievement.        
	While he, Brown and Obama were saving the world, their respective wives were having a lovely time at the Royal Opera House where Gursharan Kaur engaged in an animated conversation with the American First Lady.        
	The ladies who lunched were treated to bits of opera (Giselle), orchestral music (Vivaldi) plus readings by J.K. Rowling from her books. Earlier, Obama had told Rowling that he had read all the Harry Potter stories and had adored them.

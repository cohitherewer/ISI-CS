          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Shillong, March 25: The Shillong bench of Gauhati High Court today stayed the interim disqualification of Meghalaya Deputy Speaker and Nationalist Congress Party legislator Sanbor Shullai.        
	Justice Ashok Potsangbam in his interim verbal order said the suspension of Shullai as legislator by Speaker Bindo Lanong on March 16, a day before the Meghalaya Progressive Alliance (MPA) governments trial of strength, was not legal.        
	Shillai is the third legislator whose suspension has been stayed by the Shillong bench of Gauhati High Court.        
	Last week, the court stayed the suspension of Independent legislator Limison Sangma and Khun Hynniewtrep National Awakening Movement MLA Paul Lyngdoh.        
	The petitions against the disqualification of the other two legislators, Hill State Peoples Democratic Party legislator Adviser Pariong and Independent MLA Ismail Marak will come up for hearing on Friday.        
	Challenging the suspension order of Shullai, Justice Potsangbam observed that the Speaker had no power to award interim suspension to Shullai or any other legislator.        
	Senior counsel N. Dutta, assisted by lawyer S.P. Mahanta, argued that there was no prima facie case to disqualify Shullai.        
	Mahanta said the copy of the entire proceedings in writing would be released tomorrow. Since the written version was pending, the judge gave a verbal order.        
	After the hearing, a jubilant Shullai said: This shows that the Speaker had acted unconstitutionally by suspending the legislators.         
	The Congress, however, adopted a wait-and-watch policy before staking claim to form the next government.        
	The Supreme Court, on the other hand, today sent notices to the Centre and the state government to respond to a petition filed by the MPA against the Presidents rule in Meghalaya, fixing the next date of hearing for April 13.        
	Independent legislator Manas Chaudhuri, who is part of the MPA delegation, said over phone from New Delhi after a hearing today that the apex court had issued notices to both the Centre and the state government to provide their views on why the Presidents rule was imposed in the state.

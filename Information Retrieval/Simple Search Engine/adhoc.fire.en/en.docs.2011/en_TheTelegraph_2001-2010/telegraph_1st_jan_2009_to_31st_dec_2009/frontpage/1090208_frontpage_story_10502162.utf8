  - Knowledge city project takes off in Chirang          OUR CORRESPONDENT                             Assam chief minister Tarun Gogoi and BTC chief Hagrama Mohilary at the foundation-laying ceremony on Saturday. Telegraph picture                                        
	Kokrajhar, Feb. 7: Assams much-awaited knowledge city got off the ground today with chief minister Tarun Gogoi laying the foundation stone of the Rs 300-crore mega educational project at Rowmari in Chirang district.         
	Spread over 500 acres, the Chirang Knowledge City is being set up on a public-private partnership (PPP) model between the Bodoland Territorial Council (BTC) and the Calcutta-based Camellia Group.         
	The Camellia Group will set up a university on a 50-bigha plot within the knowledge city and 15 per cent of the seats will be reserved for students from the BTC.         
	The university is expected to offer courses in four streams  biotechnology, law, management and engineering  from 2010.         
	The private company, which has interests in education, hospitality and aviation sector, today signed a memorandum of understanding with the BTC for setting up the university which will be christened Camellia University.         
	Addressing the gathering at Kajalgaon on the occasion of the first triennial conference of Bodoland Peoples Front (BPF), Gogoi expressed hope that the knowledge city would open new vistas for the students of the region.         
	A large number of our students have to go outside for higher education due to lack of facilities here. If we can provide the facilities here, there is no need for our students to go outside, he said.         
	It is only through education that one can develop ideas and knowledge, which will help in development of the region, he added.         
	The managing director of the university, N.R. Dutta, and BTC principal secretary J.I. Kathar signed the agreement on behalf of both the parties.         
	Of the Rs 300 crore to be spent on the project, the BTC will spend Rs 5 crore while the remaining amount will be borne by the Camellia group.         
	The university will function as a fully residential one and will offer need-based programmes to mould the students as future professionals.         
	This joint venture will enable Camellia to enjoy flexibility in introducing need-based educational programmes to meet the emergent need of human resource development in the country in general and the northeastern states in particular, a senior official of the group said.         
	Education department officials said the university was a reflection of the governments commitment to improve the standard of education. More such initiatives are in the pipeline, one of them said.         
	Gogoi said the state government was keen on all-round development of the BTC and that the alliance between the BPF and the Congress at Dispur was one of development and not of politics.         
	BPF supremo Hagrama Mohilary, who was retained as the party president at the conference, said the Front would always be united and work for development of the region.         
	Praising the chief minister, Mohilary said many development activities have been initiated under the leadership of Gogoi. He urged the chief minister to look into issues like the need for an agriculture university in the Bodoland region, a separate directorate for Bodo-medium schools and Scheduled Tribe status to the Bodo Kacharis of Karbi Anglong.         
	The chief minister assured to look into these issues.         
	Gogoi also laid the foundation stone of a Rs 51-crore agriculture university at Champabati agriculture farm in Bilasipara subdivision of Dhubri district today, our Dhubri correspondent adds.

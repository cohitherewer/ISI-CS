                                                                                                           Cong dumps Khunti MP, Dhanbad open
          SUMAN K. SHRIVASTAVA                            Sushila Kerketta                                  
	Ranchi, March 16: The Congress has denied a ticket to its sitting Khunti MP Sushila Kerketta, apparently punishing her for her uninspiring presence in the Lok Sabha where she did not even raise a single question during the UPA governments five-year term.        
	In its list of candidates released late last night, the Congress named Simdega MLA Niel Tirkey in her place. He has a tough task ahead of him in Khunti, the stronghold of Munda tribes represented by the hero of the Jharkhand movement, the legendary Jaipal Singh, from 1952 to 1970.        
	For, Tirkey has to take on BJP veteran Karia Munda and the Babulal Marandi-led JVMs candidate, former Congress MLA Theodore Kido. After Jaipal Singh, another stalwart, N.E. Horo  he died recently  represented the constituency thrice till 1984.         
	The Congress high command has also kept the Dhanbad seat hanging  the partys sitting MP, Chandrashekhar Dubey, alias Dadai Dubey, is facing resistance from district leaders  leaving the field open for any one among Rajendra Singh, R.K. Anand and Mannan Mullick. It has, however, decided to stick to its remaining MPs from Jharkhand  Subodh Kant Sahay will contest from Ranchi, Rameshwar Oraon from Lohardaga, 85-year-old veteran Bagun Sumbrai from Singhbhum and Furkan Ansari from Godda .        
	According to party sources, Kerketta was denied a ticket on the grounds of her non-performance both in the Lok Sabha as well as her constituency. Besides her, JMMs Suman Mahto, too, proved to be a silent spectator in the Lok Sabha by not raising even a single question. Kerketta refused to comment.        
	All wasnt well within the UPA too. The stalemate continued for the Hazaribagh and Koderma seats, represented by the CPI and Babulal Marandi, respectively. While the Congress has staked claim on both, its alliance partner, JMM, wants to contest Hazaribagh. To add to problems, the RJD is eyeing Koderma. But state Congress chief Pradeep Balmuchu said his party had the rightful claim over both seats.        
	There were hitches in the NDA too over the three seats of Palamau, Chatra and Koderma. The BJP wants to part with either Palamau or Chatra and field its own nominee from Koderma. It has shortlisted Ravindra Rai and Lakshman Swarnkar for Koderma and favoured Inder Singh Namdhari for Chatra.

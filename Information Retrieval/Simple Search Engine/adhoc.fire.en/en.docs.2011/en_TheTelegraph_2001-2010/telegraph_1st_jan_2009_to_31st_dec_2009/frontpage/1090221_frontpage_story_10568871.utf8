	London, Feb. 20: Jade Goodys fiance Jack Tweed has had his curfew conditions changed by the ministry of justice to allow him to remain at the reception after their wedding on Sunday.         
	Cancer sufferer Goody and Tweed were said to be absolutely thrilled after being told the news that they can spend their wedding night together. The ministry of justice said the terms of Tweeds curfew, imposed following his release from prison, would be changed to reflect the exceptional circumstances.         
	Max Clifford, the couples publicist, said: We are absolutely thrilled. It will be the dream finish to her dream day, and it makes so much difference.         
	Our heartfelt thanks from Jade and from Jack for allowing him to stay the evening in these very special circumstances. The change to Tweeds release conditions mean he will be able to stay at the couples reception until 3pm on the day after their wedding instead of having to return to his mothers home by 7pm immediately after the couple tie the knot.         
	Prime Minister Gordon Brown said: I think everybody is sad at the tragedy thats befallen Jade Goody.         
	Everyone who suffers cancer has the thoughts of me and I think the whole country over what theyve got to go through.                             THE DAILY TELEGRAPH

   Muck attack on MLA, Buddha grilled          PRONAB MONDAL                       A man, while asking questions, points a finger at Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee at the Hingalganj relief camp on Tuesday. Picture by Amit Datta                                
	Hingalganj, June 2: Mud bath for a septuagenarian MLA, missiles of inquisition for the chief minister.        
	Rage fuelled by lack of relief reared its head again in Bengal with CPM MLA Gopal Gayen being roughed up in a camp where Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee was later plastered with one uncomfortable question after another.        
	At Hingalganj relief camp along the Bengal-Bangladesh border in North 24-Parganas, around six to eight men pounced on Gayen, a 78-year-old Krishak Sabha leader and local MLA, before officials and CPM cadres could throw a protective ring around him.        
	Rushing towards him with footwear in their hands, the group splashed mud on his kurta and smeared him with muck.         
	He should taste how it feels like living in muck for days, said Prabhash Gayen, an inmate, as the MLA was whisked away into a classroom in ABS Madan Mohan Vidyapith and later smuggled out of the temporary relief camp, around 80km from Calcutta.         
	Around two hours after the assault on the MLA, Bhattacharjees convoy rolled in.        
	Bam front er shesh mukhyomantri ke swagato janai (we welcome the last chief minister of the Left Front), chorused around 200 men and women standing at the entrance of the camp in Hingalganj, where the Trinamul Congress wields considerable clout since the 2008 panchayat elections.         
	The outburst was much harsher when the MLA got off his motorbike around 11.40am to survey the preparations for the chief ministers visit. Why have you come here? To see your leader? We dont need you, the people shouted before the assault took place.        
	The chief ministers convoy reached the school after a brief stopover at a relief camp in Sarberia, where he did not face hostility as he did in Gosaba on Sunday.         
	At Hingalganj, a granite-faced Bhattacharjee briskly walked towards the school, ignoring the slogans. Officials escorted him to a classroom, where around 50 men were waiting. Even before the chief minister could take his seat, some people started complaining about Gayen.         
	We are marooned for over seven days but our MLA didnt come to us even once, said Gopal Deb Mondal.                   MLA Gopal Gayen being made to hold footwear and walk through muddy water at Hingalganj. STAR Ananda footage      
	Bhattacharjee sat on a teachers chair and started inquiring about availability of relief materials. He advised the people to bury dead cattle, announcing a cash award of Rs 200 for each buried animal.        
	But where will we bury them? There is no dry land here, said Mondal, opening a barrage of questions.        
	Why cant you have an office of the irrigation department here? asked Sheikh Arzoo, a farmer.        
	Khobh er katha pore sunbo, age bandh er katha hok (we can talk about discontent later, lets first talk about the embankment), said the chief minister, referring to the administrations priority to minimise the impact of the next full-moon high tide expected this weekend.         
	We have to create embankments along Bidyadhari river and we need everyones support. Those working on the project will get a daily wage of Rs 81 and some food, said Bhattacharjee.        
	But the men in the room were asking more questions.         
	What have you done in the 32 years to ensure that we dont lose our families to calamities? asked Mondal.         
	The chief minister said he could list what the government had done for the people in the past five years. We dont want to hear all that, the crowd chorused. Give us relief.         
	More embarrassing moments followed as the villagers pointed towards the border. The people from Debrali in Bangladesh and even the BDR have extended help. What is your government doing? asked Jiyat Sardar.        
	Bhattacharjee said the administration was trying its best.         
	Sardars next query stumped Bhattacharjee. Look at the river banks across the Bangladesh border. They are metalled, well maintained, and heavy vehicles can ply on them. Here, even riding a cycle along the banks is a problem. Why hasnt your government done anything to fight erosion?         
	A glance was all Bhattacharjee could offer Sardar before leaving the school.

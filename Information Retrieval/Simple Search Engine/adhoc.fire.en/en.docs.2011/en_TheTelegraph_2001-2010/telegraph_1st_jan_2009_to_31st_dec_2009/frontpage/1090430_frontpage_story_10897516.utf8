The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Tracking delay stirs flu worry
                                                                                                           Tracking delay stirs flu worry
          G.S. MUDUR                               
	New Delhi, April 29: Flu virus behaviour and delays in finding people who have recently arrived in India from countries with swine flu may frustrate efforts to prevent the virus from entering or spreading here, experts cautioned today.         
	More than 48 hours after the health ministry said it would track passengers who had arrived over the past 10 days from Mexico, the US, Canada, among other countries, health officials said today they still didnt know how many they have to find.         
	Were waiting for details of passengers from immigration authorities, a health ministry source said.         
	Computer scientists familiar with large databases said extracting information such as points of origin of arriving passengers from a database of arrivals is relatively simple  if the database is appropriately maintained in realtime.         
	This is a straightforward query. A list may be generated in 10 or 15 minutes even from a database of hundreds of thousands or millions of entries, said Srikanth Sampara, an expert on database searches.         
	Sources said one reason for the delay in generating the list of passengers from Mexico is the absence of direct flights connecting Mexico and India. People usually fly to and return from Mexico via connecting airline hubs in North America or Europe such as Chicago, London, or Paris, the sources said.         
	While airport health officials have begun screening incoming passengers, experts believe it is important to track recent arrivals because the incubation period of the swine flu virus could be anywhere from two to seven days. They fear that infected passengers  if any  who arrived without symptoms may have fallen ill afterwards.         
	But virologists also caution that the airport screening will not make the country impermeable for the swine flu virus.         
	Traveller screening cannot prevent the entry of such a virus, said Jacob John, a virologist and public health expert formerly with the Christian Medical College, Vellore. People without fever or very low fever can be infectious and shed the virus, John said.         
	Scientists point out that influenza viruses are typically shed by infected persons before they develop fever or symptoms. In early stages of the infection, they may not be detected at all during airport screenings.         
	It (airport screening) may be imperfect, but it is the sensible thing to do, Nigel Dimmock, emeritus professor of biology at the University of Warwick in the UK told The Telegraph.         
	Health ministry officials said that while waiting for the list of the passengers who had recently arrived in India, the government will use the media to reach out and urge them to contact medical authorities if they fall ill.         
	We expect recent arrivals to follow our advice, an official said.         
	But public-health experts say the government should enhance its preparedness across the country. They fear if swine flu breaks out as an epidemic, the picture could be similar to that in the US  local outbreaks at different sites.         
	Preparedness should be decentralised  city by city, district by district, John said.         
	He said the health ministry should prepare instructions and begin a mass education campaign for the public and doctors, preparing them to recognise flu and treat it. If swine flu does not come or spread in India, fine, nothing would be lost, John said. But if it does, we will be prepared.         
	The government had on Monday announced a series of steps to increase vigilance against swine flu that has caused illness in Mexico, the US, Canada, the UK, Spain, Israel and New Zealand.

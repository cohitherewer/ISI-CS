  - Allies force govt to shift focus from Telangana to order          RADHIKA RAMASESHAN AND OUR BUREAU                                                      Mamata; Jaganmohan Reddy who joined a TDP protest in the Lok Sabha      
	Dec. 15: Mamata Banerjee and some other allies today forced the already-wavering Centre to go slow on Telangana after regional loyalties had burst into the open to convulse Parliament earlier in the day.        
	The government tonight appealed to the people and political parties of Andhra Pradesh to maintain peace and harmony after the Prime Minister chaired a meeting of the cabinet committee on political affairs attended by the Trinamul chief and the allies.        
	The statement meant the goalpost had moved  from working out the modalities for creating a separate state to restoring law and order and checking regional chauvinism.        
	Sources said the decision to take a pan-Andhra view at the cabinet committee meeting came after Mamata, NCP chief Sharad Pawar and the DMKs Dayanidhi Maran, who represent the UPA on the political affairs panel, spoke up for a united Andhra.        
	With Gorkha leaders in Bengal also clamouring for a separate state, Mamata, a known opponent of a separate Gorkhaland, signalled a message back home by stressing she was for Andhras unity.        
	The Trinamul chief, who is eyeing power in her state after an impressive electoral run, said she didnt want India to be dismembered.        
	The sources said the three allies wanted to know why they were not consulted before home minister P. Chidambarams midnight announcement last week that the Andhra Assembly would start the process for Telanganas creation.        
	They also asked why the government was taking their views after things had spun out of control in Andhra, where over 130 anti-Telangana legislators have resigned in protest.        
	Pawar, who was in the firing line for allegedly not being on top of his job in the farm ministry, got back at the Congress for bad handling.        
	Sources said the resistance from Mamata and the others may have also put paid to the move to set up a second state reorganisation committee the Congress was toying with as a way out of the mess.        
	Among the others present at the meeting were finance minister Pranab Mukherjee, home minister P. Chidambaram and external affairs minister S.M. Krishna.        
	Earlier in the day, regional rivalries erupted in the Lok Sabha when Jaganmohan Reddy, son of the late Andhra chief minister Y.S. Rajasekhar Reddy, and other non-Telangana MPs joined Telugu Desam members in opposing a division of the state.        
	As Congress MPs from Telangana screamed pro-statehood slogans, the anti-Telangana members held up paper placards that read We want united AP. Jaganmohan also flashed one after borrowing the placard from a Desam MP.        
	Analysts in Andhra said Jagans act may have catapulted him to the top of the popularity charts since the Congress high command refused to make him chief minister after his fathers death.        
	I stand by my fathers dream of an integrated Andhra, Jagan told reporters later.        
	The Congresss Telangana contingent asked defence minister A.K. Antony, who heads the party disciplinary committee, to take action against Jagan. He is not happy with the Congress high command for denying him chief ministership, Telangana MP Madhu Goud Yaskhi said.        
	Sections within the Andhra Congress said they were convinced Jagan and his loyalists had orchestrated the drama to keep the Centre and the Congress on tenterhooks.        
	This is a total violation of the spirit of the announcement of the Union home minister and also opposition to the Congress high command, party MP Sarvey Satyanarayana said in Andhra.        
	Even the YSR familys best friend, irrigation minister Ponnala Lakshmaiah, criticised Jagan. How can Jagan take sides like this? Lakshmaiah said. He should have kept himself above all these sectarian sentiments like his father.        
	Desam chief whip M. Sivaprasad claimed his partys protests were in response to peoples wish and will for unity.        
	Today, there is no party, no high command in the TDP or the Congress. Our leaders failed to read the mood on the ground that was against truncating Andhra. If the process of separation starts people will not tolerate it, he warned.         
	The day also saw Mukherjee lose his cool after a Desam MP insisted party members be allowed to speak despite the Speakers request to let a scheduled debate on railway grants get over first.        
	The Congress veteran asked the MPs to obey the Speaker. What are you saying, Sir, one of them responded.         
	First you learn manners, Mukherjee, the leader of the House, snapped back. I will expose you.

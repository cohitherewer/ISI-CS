          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                         Achuthanandan (top); Vijayan: Fight on				                                       
	New Delhi, July 4: Warring Kerala comrades V.S. Achuthanandan and Pinarayi Vijayan stuck to their guns today as the CPM politburo began a two-day meeting to find a way to end the factionalism in the state unit.         
	Sources said chief minister Achuthanandan maintained that it would be better for the party if Vijayan, charge-sheeted by the CBI for alleged corruption, stepped down as state party secretary till his name was cleared in the SNC Lavalin case.        
	Vijayan, on his part, pointed out that the chief minister had defied party discipline several times despite being given ample opportunity to correct himself. But he stopped short of calling for his rivals resignation.        
	However, several leaders of Vijayans faction have openly demanded that the chief minister step down. One of them, Kerala finance minister Thomas Isaac, had asked for Achuthanandans resignation when the party central committee met recently in Delhi.        
	The sources said Achuthanandan maintained his stand that the politburo could have discussed the Lavalin issue, and that the partys image would take a beating if it were seen to be condoning corruption.        
	The politburo had last month said the case was politically motivated and had vowed that the party would fight the case both politically and legally.        
	Most state leaders have rallied behind Vijayan except for Achuthanandan who, sources said, has been conveying to CPM leaders that the party cannot wish away a corruption case against a politburo member.        
	Party insiders said the central leadership would have to act against both leaders  suspended two years ago for indiscipline and bickering in public  if the factionalism in the state unit had to be addressed.        
	Taking stern action against only the chief minister can be seen as siding with corruption and crucifying its oldest politburo member after Jyoti Basu, the sources added.         
	Some members of the politburo, the partys highest decision-making body, agree with the chief minister on the issue of corruption. But these same members have also pointed out that at times, the chief minister had violated the Lakshman rekha of party discipline.        
	The easy option for the party, the sources said, would be Vijayan stepping down himself till his name was cleared and phasing out the 85-year-old chief minister gradually as part of a generational change.

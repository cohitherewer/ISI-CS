  - Space agency blacked out troubles with moon mission          G.S. MUDUR                             A model of Chandrayaan-1 sits at the Satish Dhawan Space Centre in Sriharikota                                        
	New Delhi, Aug. 30: For eight to 16 weeks, the Indian Space Research Organisation (Isro) shielded its struggle with Chandrayaan-1 from the public, with even some project scientists oblivious to the deep trouble with the spacecraft.         
	Isro chairman Madhavan Nair today said efforts to revive contact with the spacecraft had failed and the mission stood terminated. Chandrayaan-1 will remain in orbit until the tug of lunar gravity causes it to spiral and crash into the moon in about two years.         
	But scientists and engineers involved in the mission have said Saturdays loss of radio contact was only the culmination of a sequence of vexing events that appeared to have begun in late April with the failure of an electrical component aboard the spacecraft.         
	For some scientists involved in analysing the data sent by instruments aboard the spacecraft from its orbit 100km above the moon, the first inkling of trouble was an announcement by Isro that it had raised the orbit to 200km.         
	A component that helps in distributing electric power to on-board instruments had failed, possibly due to the high temperature and electromagnetic radiation encountered by the spacecraft in its 100km orbit, an official said.        
	Chandrayaan-1 carries five Indian and five foreign-made payloads designed to map the lunar surface, probe the interior make-up of the moon, assess its mineral resources and decipher mysteries about the origin and evolution of the moon.        
	But even after Isro had raised the spacecrafts orbit, four mission scientists from India, Sweden, the UK and the US had independently told The Telegraph that they did not know the reason for the shift of orbit. For a month, we didnt know what they were exactly doing, one scientist said today.        
	A senior scientist involved in the early phase of the project had told The Telegraph in May this year that the space agency had issued a gag order that asked researchers not to issue public statements about Chandrayaan-1 or other projects.        
	Three senior Isro officials had asserted in May that there was nothing wrong with any of the spacecraft systems and the change in the spacecrafts orbit was done to study the gravity of the moon better.        
	In reality, engineers at the Isro Deep Space Network ground station at Byalalu near Bangalore  the command and control centre for Chandrayaan-1  were scrambling to keep the spacecraft orientation under control.        
	A star sensor  an electronic eye that helps maintain the spacecrafts orientation  had failed and the only way now to keep its antenna pointed to Earth was through a backup system called a gyroscope that involved periodic, complex corrections.                          
	It was only on July 17 -- more than eight weeks after the instrument failures -- that Isro announced it had lost a star sensor. Senior officials said they believed there was no reason to release information about the loss earlier, although the project involved Rs 380 crore of taxpayers money and it was one of the most celebrated ventures of Isro.        
	One scientist said Isros claim that 95 per cent of the missions objectives have been achieved could be a perspective from the point of view of its successful launch and its insertion into lunar orbit.        
	Most of the mapping has been done. But we had planned three seasons of observations with some instruments  weve had only two so far, the scientist said.        
	Public communication about the mission has been poor, a senior official in the space agency said. This was possibly Isros most visible and publicly celebrated projects. Communication could have been handled better.        
	Isro had launched Chandrayaan-1 on October 22 and guided it into a lunar orbit on November 8. Several early lunar missions from the US and Russia had missed the moon by thousands of kilometres.        
	A senior Isro official said tonight that India could request the US or Russia to use powerful radars to try and locate Chandrayaan-1 while it continues to orbit the moon. But this would only be to track it -- not for any science.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | CM appeal: Drop state cry
                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                CM appeal: Drop state cry
          OUR BUREAU                              
	Dec 20: Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee today called upon the Gorkha Janmukti Morcha to drop the statehood demand and Pranab Mukherjee said the situation would turn complicated if its leaders refuse to be flexible.        
	A serious problem has cropped up in Darjeeling over the Morcha demand for statehood. I have already requested them (Morcha leaders) not to divide the state. Im once again telling them not to think about getting split from us, the chief minister told a public meeting in Ranigunj, about 200km from Calcutta, on the eve of the hill talks.        
	He assured Morcha leaders all possible co-operation from the state government to run the administration in the hills. I would urge them to run the administration as they want. We shall not use any force and instead fully co-operate with them.        
	Whats the use of splitting the state? Will there be another Sikkim? What will be the gain from it? the chief minister asked.        
	However, the Morcha is in no mood to heed the appeal. We will not budge an inch from our demand, its general secretary Roshan Giri said.        
	He used the chief ministers example, Sikkim, to argue in favour of smaller states. Sikkim is developing rapidly. Our demand for a separate state revolves not only on our identity but the aspirations of hill people, which have not been fulfilled for long.        
	In Calcutta, Union finance minister Pranab Mukherjee said: If somebody becomes arrogant on a demand and refuses to be flexible, the situation will become complicated. Mukherjee is also the state president of the Congress that is opposed to bifurcation of Bengal. Trinamul Congress, too, has said it is against it.        
	However, in Ranigunj, the chief minister accused Trinamul of joining forces with the Morcha. The Opposition party, Trinamul, is aligning with all those who are against us. They are joining hands with the Morcha and the Kamtapuris (who want a separate Kamtapur comprising the six north Bengal districts), he alleged.

                                Tintin: Still fifteen                            
	Brussels, Jan. 10 (AP): Tintin turns 80 today, but not a streak of gray nor a wrinkle gives it away.        
	The comic strip hero first appeared on January 10, 1929 in the Belgian newspaper Le Vingtieme Siecle (The 20th Century) taking a trip to the fledgling Soviet Union. This early strip became Tintin in the Land of the Soviets.        
	Twenty-three volumes about the boy reporter, and world fame, were to follow.        
	Tintin, Snowy the dog, and his other friends and foes have now long outlived the Soviet Union and the 20th century  as well as their Belgian creator Herge.        
	Little has changed, though, about Tintin from those early black and white days. His features became more refined and warm pastel colours were added. His round face and trademark cowlick though, have always underscored his youth. Tintin is not 80. He will always be fifteen and a half  he doesnt age, said Stefan Steeman, a collector of Tintin memorabilia and president of the Friends of Herge.        
	More than 200 million Tintin comic books have now been sold.

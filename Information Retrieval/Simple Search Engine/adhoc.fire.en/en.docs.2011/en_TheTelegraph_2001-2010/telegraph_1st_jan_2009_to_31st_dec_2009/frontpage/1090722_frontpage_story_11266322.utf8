          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                             Menon in New Delhi on Tuesday. (PTI)                                  
	New Delhi, July 21: Foreign secretary Shiv Shankar Menon today said the India-Pakistan joint statement could be blamed for bad drafting but its intention and meaning ensured the composite dialogue hadnt been delinked from the neighbours action against terrorism.        
	The bad drafting confession from the countrys top foreign ministry official is the first admission on the governments part that something was amiss in the statement.        
	The statement was issued after last weeks talks between Manmohan Singh and Pakistan Prime Minister Yousaf Raza Gilani in Egypts Sharm-al-Sheikh on the Nam summit sidelines.        
	The Opposition had slammed the statement, saying it amounted to diplomatic surrender and compromised the countrys fight against terror.        
	Menons acceptance of shoddy drafting came during an interaction with MPs after he delivered a lecture in Parliament on the challenges in foreign policy.        
	You may say its bad drafting... but the meaning is clear. The joint statement said action on terrorism should not be linked to the composite dialogue process and these should not be bracketed. It means action on terrorism should not stop because there is no dialogue, Menon explained.        
	He also tried to explain why Balochistan had found a mention  an inclusion that has come under criticism.         
	The statement says Prime Minister Gilani mentioned that Pakistan has some information on threats in Balochistan and other areas. Pakistan has been saying this but our hands are clean, Menon said.        
	On Sunday, leader of the Opposition L.K. Advani had raised this point while attacking the government over the joint statement. He said that for the first time, Pakistan had been allowed to mention Balochistan in a joint statement and that too in a way that New Delhi was made to look like the sponsor of terrorism in Balochistan and other areas.        
	To a question from an Arunachal MP about Chinas claim to parts of his state, Menon said: There is no historical basis for the claim.

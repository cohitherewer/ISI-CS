The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Minority snub for capital vote
                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                Minority snub for capital vote

	Ranchi, Nov. 27: The state capital registered one of its lowest voter turnouts since 1985 with minorities staying away in large numbers in what is a worrying trend for the two main rivals of this election, the Congress and the BJP.        
	According to final voting percentages released by the chief electoral officer today, Ranchi recorded a mere 32.91 while adjoining Hatia constituency was slightly better at 39.45 (see chart).        
	The average poll percentage in the 26 constituencies that went to polls in the first phase on November 25 was around 53.10 per cent with Pakur registering the highest at 72.34. As many as 109 of 343 polling stations registered less than 30 per cent votes. Significantly, Muslim and Christian voters, known to be aggressive champions of democracy, also remained indoors this time.        
	In fact, 27 out of 30 booths in the Muslim dominated Hindpiri area polled less than 30 per cent votes. A few of these booths registered as low as 3 (162A) and 7 per cent (no. 164) turnouts. All five polling stations in Karbala chowk polled less than 23 per cent votes.        
	The district administration, which took a number of initiatives to ensure people exercised their franchise  from street plays to Mahendra Singh Dhoni-endorsed messages  couldnt quite explain the trend.         
	BJP and Congress candidates, who are locked in a direct contest, ducked for cover. I cannot say who all did not vote. My voters said they came out and voted, said the BJPs C.P. Singh. The Congress was at a loss to explain the apathy of Muslim and Christian voters, something that must have cost its nominee, Pradeep Tulsyan. It was a result of the total disappointment of the electorate with the peoples representatives. They seemed resigned to their fate, convinced that nothing would change no matter who won, explained Tulsyan.        
	But professor Shahid Hassan of Ranchi University pinned it on Muslims feeling of alienation. Nobody has done anything for them. There wasnt a single Muslim leader when the Congress released its poll manifesto. Nor has the party promised any special package for minorities, he explained.                                
	Ajit Paul, an aide to Cardinal Telesphore Toppo, struggled to find a credible explanation. It is beyond our understanding. Christians have always voted in good numbers. The cardinal couldnt believe the trend, he said.        
	The low turnout means the victory margin will be narrow, not to talk of the unpredictable nature of the outcome. If there is a high percentage of votes, we take it as a vote against the ruling party, said Harishwar Dayal, who has studied past elections in behalf of a Delhi-based organisation.        
	He pointed out that parties, especially the BJP, failed to turn the issues of corruption and price rise into compelling reasons for people to come out and vote. The urban middle class has expressed its disillusionment with the political class, he explained.

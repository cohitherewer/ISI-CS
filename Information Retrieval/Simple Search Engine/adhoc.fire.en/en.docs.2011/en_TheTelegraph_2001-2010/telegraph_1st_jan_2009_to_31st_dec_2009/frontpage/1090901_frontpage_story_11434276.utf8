The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | State left out, BJP angry
                                                                                                           State left out, BJP angry
          OUR BUREAU                              
	Ranchi/New Delhi, Aug. 31: Jharkhand is unlikely to have an elected government before end December or beginning January 10 now that the Centre has decided to keep it out of the October 13 Assembly elections to be held in Maharashtra, Haryana and Arunachal Pradesh.        
	Now under Presidents rule since January 19, the state Assembly has been kept in suspended animation, prompting the Opposition BJP to mount criticism on Governor K. Sankaranarayanan.        
	The Election Commission said the counting of votes for October 13 elections in the three states would be held on October 22. While the notification for the polls will be issued on September 18, the last date for filing nominations is September 25. The last date for withdrawing them is September 29.        
	With the announcement of the poll dates, the model code of conduct will come into immediate effect, chief election commissioner Navin Chawla declared. All the provisions of the model code will apply to the above states and will be applicable to all candidates, political parties, the state governments concerned and the Union government from today itself, he said.        
	But contrary to expectations, Jharkhand wasnt included in todays poll announcement. Presidents rule was extended in the state for another six months  till January 19  on July 18, while the Assembly continued to be in suspended animation.         
	And so far, the governor hasnt dropped any hint on when he would recommend the dissolution of the House. All he has been saying in the last several days was that elections would be held shortly in the state.        
	State BJP president Raghubar Das demanded that the governor recommend dissolution of the House within 24 hours, or else the party would move the Supreme Court.         
	The governor is only making tall claims, but not discharging his constitutional duty. He is virtually acting as a Congress agent, he alleged.        
	Raghubar also took a swipe at Union home minister P. Chidambaram for making a false promise on holding elections in Jharkhand after the monsoon.        
	We are being forced to move the apex court after having failed to get justice from Parliament as well as the Governor, Das said.        
	It was widely expected that polls in Jharkhand would be scheduled along Maharashtra, an impression that gained ground after Chidambaram declared in Parliament that the state would see elections after the rainy season.        
	But by removing Syed Sibtey Razi and posting Sankaranarayanan, the Congress made it clear it had other ideas, said a senior partyman here.         
	The BJP also criticised the move of Governors adviser T.P. Sinha to seek the help of the Catholic Church for distributing foodgrain in the drought-hit state. Why is the Church being approached? The Church has vested interest in tribal areas and distributing foodgrain through it is a move to lure tribals to the Congress before the elections, former chief minister and BJP MP Arjun Munda said.

          SAMBIT SAHA                              
	Kharagpur, March 7: Steel has taken the trail blazed by the Nano out of Singur.        
	Tata Metaliks, Indias largest pig iron manufacturer and one of the early private steel investors in Bengal, has scrapped its expansion project in the state, citing inordinate delay in land acquisition.        
	The company, a subsidiary of Tata Steel and headquartered in Calcutta, today said it was not pursuing a proposal for an integrated steel plant (see chart) any more.         
	It is not an impulsive decision. We had waited for four years. Business plans cannot be made on such uncertainties, said Harsh K. Jha, the managing director of the company.        
	Government sources conceded delay in land acquisition  a political hot potato since the Nandigram flare-up as well as the Singur fiasco and symptomatic of the timidity that had gripped governance in the run-up to elections.        
	But the government sources suggested that differences over land price and the global economic downturn could also have played a part in the rethink. Steel prices have crashed from $1,250 a tonne to $450 a tonne, taking a toll on expansion plans of several companies.        
	Tata Metaliks officials pointed out that the company was still actively pursuing a similar project on a larger scale in Karnataka but suggested that the tight financial market has had an indirect impact.         
	That (Karnataka) project is making steady progress while Bengal is uncertain. With the tight financial market, it could be difficult to do both projects simultaneously. And we do not want to promise and then not deliver, a company official said.        
	But Jha said Karnataka was always being considered and Bengal was not being dumped because of it.         
	A strong sentiment exists within the company that the Bengal government did not pay enough attention to Tata Metaliks. The announcement of the steel project, which could have created 1,500 to 2,000 direct and indirect jobs, had preceded the Nano project but was overshadowed by it.        
	Tata Metaliks patiently waited as the state government lavished attention on mega projects. It seemed there was no place for people who quietly deliver small projects. You had to make big announcements, which may not even materialise, to grab attention, an official said. Tata Metaliks had sought 500 acres adjacent to its pig iron and ductile iron pipe plant at Kharagpur in early 2005. The state government was ready to offer 350 acres, which the company agreed to.        
	But the state could acquire only 192 acres so far  by when land prices went up from around Rs 4 lakh an acre to Rs 8-9 lakh. The company had reservations about the price.         
	The West Bengal Industrial Development Corporation (WBIDC), a shareholder in Tata Metaliks with board representation, was entrusted with the job of acquiring land.         
	We tried to acquire land directly from the owner. That took time. So we decided to acquire land through the land acquisition act. However, we could not arrive at the price to be paid for acquisition, Subrata Gupta, the WBIDC managing director, told The Telegraph. Gupta added that he had offered to give the balance land in the next three months.        
	Officials of Tata Metaliks and the WBIDC had met on February 19. Three issues had cropped up then  the delay, the land price and the presence of high-tension power lines, the towers which stand in the way of construction in some places.        
	But company officials admitted that the power lines were already in place when it chose the site. In fact, one line supplies power to the companys existing plant.        
	Second, WBIDC officials showed some 20 deeds whereby the company acquired land directly at prices ranging between Rs 8 lakh and Rs 11 lakh an acre, sources said. The version could not be verified with company officials.         
	Price is something the government cannot control. We had bought the land at Rs 4 lakh an acre. Now it is higher. But people are willing to sell there at right prices. Had we agreed on the price, it would not have been difficult, Gupta said.        
	However, Tata Metaliks has not entirely stopped its expansion in Bengal. A ductile iron pipe plant will be expanded in a year.

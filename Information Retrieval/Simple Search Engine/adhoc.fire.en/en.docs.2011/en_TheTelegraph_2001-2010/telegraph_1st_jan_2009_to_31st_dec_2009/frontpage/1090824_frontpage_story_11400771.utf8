The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Amendment hint for NSCN-IM
                                                                                                           Amendment hint for NSCN-IM
  - Centre reveals possibility of Constitution change for Naga peaces      OUR CORRESPONDENT                                           
	Imphal/Kohima, Aug. 23: The Centre is drafting a proposal to place before the NSCN (Isak-Muivah) leaders as a solution to the Naga problem and may even consider amending the Constitution to accommodate the outfits demands.         
	The next round of Naga talks between the Centre and the National Socialist Council of Nagalim (Isak-Muivah) is slated for the last week of this month.         
	They (NSCN-IM) had put forward some proposals. On our part, we are also preparing counter proposals. These will be placed before the NSCN (I-M) leaders after getting the approval of the cabinet. This may take a few months, Union home secretary G.K. Pillai told reporters before leaving Imphal at the end of a three-day visit.         
	Pillai was here to attend two development seminars, review the implementation of various schemes and assess the law and order situation in the state.         
	The peace talks have made substantial progress. Both sides understand Indias Constitution and the issue of autonomy. But we have made it very clear to them that Manipurs territorial integrity is sacrosanct and it will not be disturbed, Pillai said.         
	He did not disclose the details of the proposal being prepared, but hinted that the Constitution would be amended to give adequate power to Nagaland.         
	Our Constitution is flexible, so it can be amended if necessary. We can give them adequate powers on financial, cultural, social and financial aspects. They may express doubts on some of the proposals and accept some of them. This is a negotiation, he said.         
	The NSCN (I-M), however, said they were yet to receive an invitation from the Centre for the talks, which is expected to be held in Bangkok, Thailand.         
	We are yet to receive invitation from the government of India, said Vikiye Sumi, kilonser (minister) for information and publicity of the government of the Peoples Republic of Nagalim.         
	Though other officials of the NSCN had confirmed that the talks would be held in Bangkok, Sumi said they had not decided on the venue of the talks, but it would definitely be outside India as agreed upon in the agreements prior to the July 1997 ceasefire declaration.

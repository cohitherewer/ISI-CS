          RADHIKA RAMASESHAN                            Gadkari at the BJP office on Saturday. (Ramakant Kushwaha)                                  
	New Delhi, Dec. 19: A man known for building highways and flyovers will be trying to pave the BJPs path to power.        
	As Maharashtras road and transport minister in 1995, Nitin Gadkari had commissioned a study on accident-prone spots, accepted its findings and instantly sanctioned Rs 20 crore to make the roads safer. Today, shortly after replacing Rajnath Singh as BJP president, he told journalists: Where there is a will there is a way; if there is no will, there will only be a survey.        
	Actually, he said: surveys, discussions, seminars, committees and sub-committees but no way, rather spoiling the effect.         
	In his white, gulal-smeared khadi shirt, beige linen trousers and hands bereft of the astrological rings that adorn so many north Indian netas fingers, the new party chief looked a bit like a stockbroker from Dalal Street who had wandered into Delhis political jungle.        
	He said his overnight stay in Delhi this weekend, with wife Kanchan and daughter Ketki, would be a first in five years. Else I land in the morning and am off by evening. Theres so much work to be done in Maharashtra.        
	Gadkari, who will formally take over charge on December 24, has already notched two more firsts: he is the only businessman to head a major political party in India and, at 52, is the youngest BJP president. His business interests range from manufacturing PVC pipes and steel furniture to running co-operatives that make saris and paper, and exporting fruits.        
	It is important to have in politics people who have their legitimate sources of earning. They will not be digging for gold in others mines, another BJP leader with independent means said.        
	Gadkari belongs to Nagpur and has always been close to the RSS, especially its current chief Mohanrao Bhagwat. The Sangh picked him to run the party the way it wanted.         
	Gadkari was clear about what was expected of him. When there is strong political will, that will sort out all kinds of problems. When I wanted to construct the Mumbai-Pune expressway, I was told the outlay was Rs 200 crore. How much time, I asked? Two-and-a-half years. What is the amount on hand? Rs 5 crore. But I had made a promise and I fulfilled it. Because I never give false promises, he said.        
	Advani told party workers: The NDA government is best remembered for its road connectivity, its commitment to infrastructure. This is Nitins contribution: expressways, roads, highways.        
	On the dais with Advani, Rajnath, Sushma Swaraj and Arun Jaitley, Gadkari said: As I share space with you, I am also conscious that I am much junior to all of you. I need your encouragement and guidance and everyones co-operation.        
	Co-operation was the operative word. Underlying the celebratory mood in the BJP is anxiety about whether Gadkari, a greenhorn in intrigue-ridden Delhi and without a popular base, can pull the party out of the rut.

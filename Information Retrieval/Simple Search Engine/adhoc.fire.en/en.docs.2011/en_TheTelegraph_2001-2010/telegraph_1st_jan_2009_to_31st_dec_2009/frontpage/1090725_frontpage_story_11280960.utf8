          OUR BUREAU                              
	New Delhi, July 24: The Centre will go ahead and re-introduce the Land Acquisition (Amendment) Bill 2007 and the Rehabilitation and Resettlement Bill 2007 in Parliament, overruling the objections of Mamata Banerjee, several official sources said.         
	It was a commitment the UPA made in the Presidents address to Parliament (in June 2009) and the address was cleared by the cabinet that included Ms Banerjee. Again, she is also a member of the cabinet that okayed the bills, a Congress minister pointed out, underlining the importance of collective decision-making.        
	The only concession is that the government will not push the bills through in the next two weeks before the House adjourns. In keeping with practice, they will be referred to the standing committee on rural development.         
	The standing panels have yet to be formed. Till that is done and the bills are studied, Mamata, said sources, can breathe easy. The committees reports are routed to the law and justice ministry that takes the final call. The government is not bound to accept the reports but, by convention, some of the recommendations are incorporated. The law ministry gives the bills to the cabinet for ratification before they return to Parliament.        
	When the cabinet met on Thursday night to endorse the bills that had lapsed because they could not be sent to the Rajya Sabha under the previous government, Mamata said they were unacceptable.        
	The proposed changes allow private parties to acquire 70 per cent of the land for a project from farmers. The state government is to acquire the rest 30 per cent.        
	Mamata does not want the state government to be involved or private buyers to be allowed directly to purchase land because the provisions do not protect the farmers from acquisition either by force or by the lure of money or material bribe, Trinamul sources said.        
	Trinamuls agitation in Singur and Nandigram was based on opposition to forcible takeover of land by the government. A party MP said: It is impossible for us to accept these amendments as these are opposed to the stand we have taken in Bengal.

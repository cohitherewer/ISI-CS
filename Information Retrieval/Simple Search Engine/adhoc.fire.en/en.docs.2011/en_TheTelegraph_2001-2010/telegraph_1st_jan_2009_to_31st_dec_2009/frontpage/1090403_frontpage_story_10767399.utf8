The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Morcha offers hill ticket to Jaswant
                                                                                                           Morcha offers hill ticket to Jaswant
  - BJP keen to field veteran in sure-fire seat          VIVEK CHHETRI                                                    
	Darjeeling, April 2: The Gorkha Janmukti Morcha has offered its bastion, the Darjeeling Lok Sabha seat, to BJP veteran Jaswant Singh, a former army officer who is expected to strike a chord among a large number of voters in the hills.        
	BJP sources said the party had more or less made up its mind to accept the seat and in return adopt a sympathetic attitude towards the Morchas demand for a separate state, Gorkhaland. Chances of a candidate supported by the Morcha, whose writ runs in the hills, winning the Darjeeling seat are extremely bright.        
	We have invited Jaswant Singh to contest from Darjeeling and it is more or less confirmed that the BJP will agree to it. We will sit for a meeting with the BJP again at 10.30 tomorrow morning, Morcha chief Bimal Gurung told The Telegraph.        
	The Morcha announcement followed a meeting in Delhi this evening between the Morcha leadership and BJP leaders L.K. Advani, S.S. Ahluwalia and Jaswant who is now the partys leader in the Rajya Sabha.        
	Gurung, who flew to Delhi after attending a programme in Guwahati, met the BJP leaders at Advanis residence and tried to impress upon them the benefits that would accrue to the BJP if it supported the Gorkhaland cause and put up a candidate supported by the Morcha from Darjeeling.        
	We told the BJP leadership that the Morcha could influence the outcome in at least 10 seats across the country where the Gorkhas have a considerable presence, a Morcha leader said.        
	Although the BJP has already announced its candidate for the Darjeeling seat, former IPS officer Dawa Sherpa, Morcha leaders said they were confident that the BJP would accept the Morchas invitation.        
	 Dawa Sherpa has not yet filed his nomination papers which can be done till April 9. The election to the seat, won by the Congress in 2004, will be held on April 30.        
	The Morcha leadership had so far been insisting that it would support the candidate of any national party that included the demand for Gorkhaland in its election manifesto. But, Morcha leaders said, Gurung was satisfied with the assurance from the BJP leadership that it would pursuethe Gorkhaland cause.        
	Morcha leaders said the BJP manifesto, slated to be released tomorrow, contained the words that the national party would sympathetically and appropriately consider the problem of Gorkhas and Adivasis in Darjeeling and the Dooars region.         
	The BJP is an advocate of smaller states and had gained from the formation of Chhattisgarh, Uttarakhand and Jharkhand         
	 The Morcha had earlier proposed the name of Ahluwalia, but the BJP leader had turned it down.        
	Today, Gurung said he was happy at the signals he had received from the BJP leadership regarding Singhs candidature.        
	This will definitely be a big achievement for us. For long, the Gorkhaland demand had been confined to Calcutta. We can now say that it is being seriously looked into by a national party in Delhi, he said.        
	Roshan Giri, general secretary of the Morcha, said that if the BJP agreed to field Singh from Darjeeling, the outfit could also support BJP candidates from the Alipurduar and Jalpaiguri Lok Sabha seats.         
	The Gorkhas have a significant presence there, especially in Alipurduar, he said. We would definitely make a difference in these two constituencies.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | The questions on your mind
                                                                                                           The questions on your mind
                            
	Answers to some of the questions many people were asking on Friday:              
	 What is wrong with the Prime Ministers health?         
	The arteries that carry blood to his heart are blocked with multiple fatty deposits. Such multiple blockages have the potential to disrupt normal blood supply to the heart and injure the heart muscle irreversibly.         
	 What is the treatment?         
	The PM is likely to undergo a coronary bypass surgery, a procedure in which doctors use a healthy blood vessel (artery) to create a detour around a blockage in an artery that feeds blood to the heart muscle. The new blood vessel called a graft provides a new channel for blood flow to the heart.         
	 Did the PM have a similar surgery earlier?        
	The PM has had a previous bypass operation and an angioplasty. Doctors say the repeat surgery is technically complicated because it involves working on tissues and blood vessels that have already been operated upon once.         
	 How risky is a bypass surgery?         
	Any major surgical procedure carries a risk. A first-time bypass surgery itself carries a small risk. This is a repeat bypass, which adds to this risk. Doctors say the PM also has diabetes which contributes to the risk.        
	 What are the factors in favour of the PM?         
	His hearts pumping function is good and intact. He has not had a heart attack. This reduces the risk from the surgical procedure and bolsters the chances of quick recovery.        
	 Is there an alternative procedure?         
	Arterial blockages can also be addressed through coronary angioplasty in which the blocks in the arteries are removed with catheters, and devices called stents are placed to maintain blood flow to the heart. But in the PMs case, doctors say, the location and the nature of the blockages in the heart preclude angioplasty.        
	 What could have happened if the surgery was not done?         
	The blockages can disrupt blood flow to the heart, denying blood to the heart muscle, which can cause parts of the muscle to die and reduce the pumping capacity of the heart. In the worst-case scenario, such disruption of blood flow could turn fatal.         
	 Who will carry out the surgery?         
	A team of doctors from the Asian Heart Institute (AHI), Mumbai, and the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), New Delhi, led by the AHIs Ramakant Panda, who has done more than 1,500 high- risk bypass surgeries and 700 repeat procedures. Panda has arrived with his own team of two doctors and several paramedic staff from Mumbai. Both teams will work together. As one senior doctor put it today: This is not Delhi Daredevils versus Mumbai Indians. This is Team India batting for the PM.        
	 How long will the PM have to stay in hospital? What about rest at home?         
	He may be discharged within seven to 10 days. He could begin looking at official files from home about two weeks after the surgery. After that, hell be encouraged to start working towards resuming normal activities at whatever pace he is comfortable with.        
	When can he resume normal activities?         
	Doctors expect that he would be in a position to return to normal activities in about six to eight weeks, which means between the second and third week of March.              
	Medically, is a high-stress job like that of a Prime Minister advisable after multiple bypass surgeries?         
	Doctors say a clear answer to this will be available after the surgery, but it is possible for such patients to return to normal activity, including high-stress jobs, after full recovery.              
	 Would he have received better medical care abroad?         
	The repeat, or redo, cardiac surgery is a complicated procedure and the risk substantially reduces when it is done by surgeons specially experienced in redos. A few experts did advise the PM to consider getting the procedure done in institutions outside India, but the PM opted to have it in New Delhi at AIIMS.              
	The PM has no vices. So, how did he get this condition?         
	Doctors cant say for sure. But its not just vices such as smoking and excessive eating that can increase the risk of blockages. A high fat diet may also contribute to blockage formation.

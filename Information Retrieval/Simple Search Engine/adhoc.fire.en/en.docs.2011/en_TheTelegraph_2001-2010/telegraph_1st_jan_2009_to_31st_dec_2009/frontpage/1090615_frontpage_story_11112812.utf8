The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Extension of agony
                                                                                                           Extension of agony
  - Cabinet secy fresh term hits promotions           JAYANTH JACOB                                                    
	New Delhi, June 14: The countrys top babus are finding out what it feels like standing in a queue for ages only to be told sorry at the end.        
	The extension given to cabinet secretary K.M. Chandrashekhar, who was due to retire in July, has left a cloud of despondency hanging in the by-lanes of bureaucracy. The 1970-batch IAS officer will now occupy the post till June 13 next year, setting back three 1972-batch colleagues chances of holding the countrys top bureaucratic job.        
	Home secretary G.K. Pillai, his wife and labour secretary Sudha Pillai, and agriculture secretary T.K. Nandakumar are all due to retire before June 13 next year. Even if they get extensions, that is unlikely to improve the possibility of their bagging the top post that brings an automatic two-year tenure.        
	Sudha Pillai, the senior-most among the three, therefore appears to have missed out on becoming the countrys first woman cabinet secretary  despite women being the flavour of the season, as an IAS source said.         
	The Lok Sabha has just got its first woman Speaker, two years after the previous UPA government gave India its first woman President.        
	Pillai is the second woman to have come close to bagging the post. Reva Nayyar, a Haryana cadre officer who was in the running in 2006, lost out when the then cabinet secretary, B.K. Chaturvedi, got a one-year extension.        
	One blocked promotion means several more down the line, so its no wonder that many senior IAS officers are grumbling that the practice of extensions undermines the principle of merit, of everyone getting an opportunity.        
	Some others, however, point out that one bureaucrats loss can be anothers gain. The gainers in this instance could be urban development secretary M. Ramachandran and tourism secretary S. Banerjee, both from the 1972 batch.        
	These two officials will have a little less than two months of their tenures left when Chandrashekhar retires, but if the principle of seniority is followed, one of them could replace him. Neither would have had the opportunity if Chandrashekhar had been denied an extension and one of the Pillais or Nandakumar been promoted.        
	Merit has nothing to do with a particular batch, does it? a bureaucrat said.        
	Standing in line after Ramachandran and Banerjee is the 1973-batch officer, parliamentary affairs secretary P.J. Thomas. Then, from the 1974 batch, there is the high-profile Pulok Chatterjee, who has served in the Prime Ministers Office and is now an executive director with the World Bank, and overseas Indian affairs secretary K. Mohandas.        
	Chatterjees World Bank tenure lasts till 2011 but he can be brought back to the Indian government with the consent of the banks board of directors.        
	The plight of their IAS colleagues is worrying some in the foreign service too. Foreign secretary Shiv Shankar Menon is due to retire at the end of July, and IFS circles are agog with speculation whether he too might get an extension.        
	If he doesnt, the front-runner seems to be Nirupama Rao of the 1973 batch who is now ambassador to China. Rao has been high commissioner to Sri Lanka and a foreign ministry spokesperson too. Also in the reckoning is Nalin Suri, secretary (west) in the foreign ministry.

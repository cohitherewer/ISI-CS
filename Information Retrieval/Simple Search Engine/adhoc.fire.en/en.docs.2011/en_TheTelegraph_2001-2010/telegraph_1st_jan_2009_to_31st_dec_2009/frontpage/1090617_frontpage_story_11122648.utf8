  - Post-Mumbai, navy vets French concept           SUJAN DUTTA                            Role model                                        
	New Delhi, June 16: Half a year after the terror attack in Mumbai that was mounted from the sea, Indias quest for a coastal security grid has taken its navy to France to study Napoleons fortifications on that countrys Atlantic and Mediterranean shores.        
	The Indian Navys western fleet commander Rear Admiral S.P.S. Cheema is in France to study the Prefet Maritime concept of the French navy, dating back to Napoleons time, and its current technology backup that uses a network called Spationav.        
	The Indian Navy was designated the nodal agency for maritime security after 26/11. All actions by the state marine police and the coast guard would be co-ordinated by the Indian Navy.         
	Last month, the director-general of the coast guard, Vice Admiral Anil Chopra, also visited France.        
	Napoleons concept of coastal security involved sea forts on Frances Atlantic and Mediterranean shores. More than two centuries later, these fortifications are a networked entity around the coasts that allow Frances maritime authorities to look deep into the sea and monitor friend or foe traffic.        
	The Indian Navy, in its new role as the nodal agency for maritime security, wants to use the experience of France to evolve a network that will allow it to collate data from civilian and military authorities such as state agencies, ministries of fisheries, shipping, oil and natural gas and customs.         
	France is understood to have offered the Spationav system, a network developed by EADS, a European defence consortium.        
	Spationav is a maritime border surveillance system that is marketed particularly for monitoring waters around metropolises  such as Mumbai  and offshore installations.         
	India is buying surveillance systems for its coast guard and navy. For the navy, it has ordered P8I aircraft from the US.        
	But before the navy gets into the nitty-gritty of buying a system, it is studying command and control structures that it could need to evolve among multiple authorities. A new Maritime Security Agency has also been formed by India.         
	A senior Indian Navy official said Frances model was attractive because it had a single-point authority in the Prefet Maritime concept.         
	We are at first interested in studying the models. 26/11 has taught us many lessons and we are also trying to learn from the best practices of other countries. France has a particularly interesting solution that we are looking at, he said.        
	The flotilla of the western fleet commanded by Cheema will engage the French navy in the latest edition of the India-French exercise, Varuna, off the coast of Brittany in the Atlantic from June 27 to July 4. This is the first time Varuna is being held off France.        
	The Indian naval task force includes the destroyer INS Delhi, frigates INS Brahmaputra and Beas, and fleet tanker INS Aditya with onboard helicopters.         
	The French will deploy the destroyer Primauguet, the frigate Lieutenant de Vaisseau Le Hanaff, the nuclear-powered attack submarine Emeraude, maritime patrol and naval fighter aircraft under their Admiral Commanding Atlantic Ocean Zone.

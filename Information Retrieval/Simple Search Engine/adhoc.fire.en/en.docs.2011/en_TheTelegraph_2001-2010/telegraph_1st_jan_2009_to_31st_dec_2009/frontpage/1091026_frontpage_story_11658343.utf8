	Ranchi, Oct. 25: Police intercepted and fought a one-and-half-hour gunbattle with a group of CPI(Maoist) rebels moving in a convoy around Angara this morning, foiling an attempt to cross over into Purulia in Bengal from the dense forests of the area thats 25km from the capital.        
	The body of a Maoist rebel in police uniform was recovered along with three automatic rifles and 250 rounds of ammunition, but the police claimed at least three other rebels were killed.         
	Senior police superintendent Praveen Kumar and commandant of CRPFs 133 battalion R.K. Sharma said at a joint news conference that around 30 Maoists were spotted moving on in two jeeps, probably to execute an operation in the neighbouring state.        
	At first, three persons escorting the two vehicles carrying the Maoists were arrested. While the first two were on a motorbike, the third one was in a four-wheeler. They have been identified as Vikram Mahto, Kamalkant Munda and Satyendra Sahu, he said.        
	On being challenged by the police near Tirkey Chowk around 2.15am, the Maoists opened fire indiscriminately and even used a hand grenade before fleeing the area.         
	When they found themselves surrounded by CRPF, District Armed Police and Jharkhand Armed Police jawans, they took advantage of the darkness and fled into the forests, said a CRPF jawan involved with the encounter.        
	The police used a bullet-proof van to intercept the Maoists vehicle and continue their onslaught on the fleeing rebels, suspected to be members of the Kundan Pahan gang active in the Bundu-Tamar area.        
	Though we have been able to recover the body of only one Maoist, our sources maintain that at least four Maoists had been killed and three rebels sustained injuries, Kumar added.         
	He said among the weapons seized, one was an Auto FAL Rifle in which magazines of an SLR or LMG can be fitted. The second one was an automatic Insas rifle. Both looked like having been looted from the police or CRPF, he added.         
	The area around Jonha panchyat under Angara police station where the encounter took place, is considered to be a safe zone for rebels crossing over to Purulia in Bengal via Bundu, Rahe, Sonahatu and Muri.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Rush to avoid Mamata-CPM rail collision
                                                                                                           Rush to avoid Mamata-CPM rail collision
  - Left party keen to keep House panel but Centre fears run-ins with Trinamul minister           RADHIKA RAMASESHAN                              Mamata, Acharya				                                       
	New Delhi, June 27: The government is in a fix with the CPM wishing to continue to head the parliamentary standing committee on railways.        
	The UPA fears that with Marxist Basudeb Acharya as chairman of this prized panel, Mamata Banerjee might see red.        
	Acharya had been the panels head also when Mamata became railway minister the last time, in the year 2000. The NDA government had then gently persuaded the CPM to give up the committee, which the party had chaired uninterrupted since 1991, and settle for another.        
	The UPA government is now working on Acharya to accept the chairmanship of a different House panel. The last thing the government wants is daily run-ins between Mamata and the Left, an official said.        
	The CPM is apparently weighing the option of taking up the chairmanship of another infrastructure-related ministry. Government sources, however, said the UPA wasnt too keen on this either, fearing that a CPM-headed committee might scupper or sit on reforms bills. Parliament usually refers controversial bills to the appropriate standing committees.        
	Sources said parliamentary affairs minister Pawan Bansal had recently called Acharya, the leader of the CPM in the Lok Sabha, and asked which House panel his party would like to chair.        
	The chairmanships are given in proportion to a partys strength in the House. In 2004, the Left was entitled to three such posts but now it can have only one.        
	Acharya told The Telegraph he had listed railways as the partys first choice, followed by coal and steel, and then energy. He said Bansal asked him to name a fourth choice, preferably in the social sector.        
	A government source confirmed this, adding that Bansal had suggested rural development, a big ticket ministry packed with ambitious schemes directly touching the lives of the poor.        
	Acharya, however, said: I reiterated that railways was our first preference. I told him I had chaired the standing committee (on railways) from 1996 except for a small break. I said I had authored 44 reports and some of the recommendations had been implemented by the ministry. Why should there be a problem?        
	Told the problem was perhaps Mamata, he shot back: That depends on the minister, whether he or she takes a partisan view of the committee. A standing committee functions impartially and all decisions are taken unanimously. In the 44 reports I submitted, there was no dissenting note.        
	Acharya said if the CPM didnt get railways, it would insist on coal and steel, or energy.        
	House panel chairmanships have always been decided informally, so its unclear what the rules are about settling a standoff. Government sources, however, said they would not allow things to reach such a pass.        
	The Left leaders are reasonable and understand the nuances of a situation. We hope the matter will be sorted out by next week, a source said.        
	Today, as chairman of the outgoing committee, Acharya shot off a letter to Mamata urging her to modernise the railway printing presses, which employ more than 5,000 workers, instead of outsourcing the ministrys printing jobs.        
	The 40 House standing committees have two main tasks. One, to examine the various ministries demands for grants during the budget session. Two, to study the bills the House cannot debate in detail.        
	The committees recommendations are not binding. At worst, their reports can embarrass the government by exposing major flaws in a bill or hinting at a conflict of interest.

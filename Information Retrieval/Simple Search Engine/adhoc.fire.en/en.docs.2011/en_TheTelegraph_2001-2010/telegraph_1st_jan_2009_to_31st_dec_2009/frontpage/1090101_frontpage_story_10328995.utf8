The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Happy New Air?
                                                                                                           Happy New Air?
          CALCUTTA HAS A CHANCE TODAY TO TAKE THE MOST MEANINGFUL STRIDE YET TOWARDS CLEANING THE AIR IT BREATHES BY KEEPING AWAY AUTOS THAT SPEW POISON. THE ODDS ARE STACKED IN FAVOUR OF DELIBERATE COMMISSION AND OMISSION TO ABORT THE CLEAN-UP. BEFORE AN ALL-TOO-FAMILIAR CONSPIRACY OF CONVENIENCE AND EXPEDIENCY GNAWS AT THE BEST GIFT WE CAN OFFER A GROWING-UP GENERATION, THINK OF SHAON MANDAL AND HIS APPEAL. CAN BENGAL GIFT HIM...                            A two-stroke auto spits smoke on Bridge No 4 in Calcutta on Wednesday. Picture by Sanat Kumar Sinha                                  
	Shaon Mandal, 7 years, a resident of Kasba, speaks              
	I miss school frequently as I have breathing trouble quite often. Some of my friends in class have better attendance than me and I feel bad about it. I often have to skip important exams.        
	On days when I take my medicines and go to school, I feel sick but try not to tell my teacher about it.        
	The doctor tells my father that my asthma problem is because of pollution from vehicles in Calcutta. Why cant somebody stop the pollution?        
	My father tells me that the main cause of pollution are the autos that speed down the roads with smoke coming out of the pipe at the back.        
	When I went to Delhi last winter, I saw so many autos that do not give out any smoke. I asked my father why, and he said that the government there has made sure that there are no autos that spread pollution. Why cant our government do the same, I asked him? He had no answer.                    
	The doctor also tells my mother that I must play in fresh air so that I feel better. But my mother says there is too much pollution around and so I stay at home most of the time after coming back from school.        
	Last week I went to Jhargram where I had no problem breathing. My mother said that was because there was no pollution. I did not fall sick even once and I was so happy.        
	My parents have said the New Year will be better for me, thanks to the high court and the government. They will stop almost all the autos that pollute. The ones that will be allowed will become like the autos in Delhi.        
	Does that mean I will fall sick less often and I will attend school as regularly as my classmates? Does that mean it will not hurt when I breathe?        
	Then, this will really be a Happy New Year for me.

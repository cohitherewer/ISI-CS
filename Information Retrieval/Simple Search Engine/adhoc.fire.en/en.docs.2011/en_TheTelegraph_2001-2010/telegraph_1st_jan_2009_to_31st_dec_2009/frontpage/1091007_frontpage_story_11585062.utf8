The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | US push to expand in Pak meets resistance

	Islamabad, Oct. 6: Steps by the US to vastly expand its aid to Pakistan, as well as the footprint of its embassy and private security contractors here, are aggravating an already volatile anti-American mood as Washington pushes for greater action by the government against the Taliban.        
	An aid package of $1.5 billion a year for the next five years passed by Congress last week asks Pakistan to cease supporting terrorist groups on its soil and to ensure that the military does not interfere with civilian politics.         
	President Asif Ali Zardari, whose association with the US has added to his unpopularity, agreed to the stipulations in the aid package.         
	But many here, especially in the powerful army, object to the conditions as interference in Pakistans internal affairs, and they are interpreting the larger American footprint in more sinister ways.        
	American officials say the embassy and its security presence must expand in order to monitor how the new money is spent. They also have real security concerns, which were underscored yesterday when a suicide bomber, dressed in the uniform of a Pakistani security force, killed five people at a UN office in the heart of Islamabad. The US embassy has publicised plans for a vast new building in Islamabad for about 1,000 people, with security for some diplomats provided through a Washington-based private contracting company, DynCorp.        
	The embassy set-up, with American demands for importing more armoured vehicles, is a significant expansion over the last 15 years. It comes at a time of intense discussion in Washington over whether to widen American operations and aid to Pakistan  a base for the al Qaida  as an alternative to deeper American involvement in Afghanistan with the addition of more forces.        
	The fierce opposition here is revealing deep strains in the alliance. Even at its current levels, the American presence was fuelling a sense of occupation among Pakistani politicians and security officials, said several Pakistani officials, who did not want to be named for fear of antagonising the US. The United States was now seen as behaving in Pakistan much as it did in Iraq and Afghanistan, they said.        
	In particular, the Pakistani military and the intelligence agencies are concerned that DynCorp is being used by Washington to develop a parallel network of security and intelligence personnel within Pakistan, officials and politicians close to the army said.        
	The concerns are serious enough that last month a local company hired by DynCorp to provide Pakistani men to be trained as security guards for American diplomats was raided by the Islamabad police. The owner of the company, the Inter-Risk Security Company, Captain Syed Ali Ja Zaidi, was later arrested.        
	The action against Inter-Risk, apparently intended to cripple the DynCorp programme, was taken on orders from the senior levels of the Pakistani government, said an official familiar with the raid.        
	The entire workings of DynCorp within Pakistan are now under review by the Pakistani government, said a senior government official directly involved with the Americans.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Maintain peace: MP to Morcha
                                                                                                           Maintain peace: MP to Morcha
          VIVEK CHHETRI                              
	Darjeeling, Aug. 27: Jaswant Singh has advised the Gorkha Janmukti Morcha leadership to move beyond agitation and concentrate on development while maintaining peaceful activism.         
	The Darjeeling MPs appeal came in response to a questionnaire from The Telegraph. In his reply, Jaswant said he remained dedicated to the Gorkhaland demand, fielding a question on the impact of his expulsion from the BJP (excerpts below).        
	The Morcha on its part has partially endorsed Singhs advice. But party publicity secretary Harka Bahadur Chhetri said: Of late, we have indulged in peaceful activism but if the state and the Centre start coming up with counter strategies to derail our movement, we will definitely fall back on the masses.         
	The hill party had withdrawn its agitation after the August 11 talks with the central and state governments. But it has not withdrawn the call to stop paying taxes and levies to the state government.         
	TT: Do you think your disassociation with the BJP is a setback for the Gorkhaland demand as the Morcha has hinted that they would need both you and the BJP to achieve their demand?         
	JS: No, I dont. I made a commitment to the issue, I was elected on the issue and I remain dedicated to the issue. As for the BJP, they included the issue in their election manifesto and I see no reason for them to backtrack.               
	TT: If at any time the BJP pressures the Morcha to sever ties with you, would you think of resigning as the MP of Darjeeling?         
	JS: My position is clear. I remain a representative of Darjeeling because the Gorkha Janmukti Morcha showed faith in me and asked me to continue.               
	TT: How do you plan to mobilise support for the demand in the wake of recent developments?         
	JS: I will actively continue to engage members across party lines to generate support and awareness among my colleagues on the Gorkhaland issue, as I have done over the past months.               
	TT: What would be your advice to the Morcha, vis--vis, the agitation and the recent political developments?         
	JS: We have to move beyond agitation and concentrate on the development of the region, while maintaining peaceful activism.

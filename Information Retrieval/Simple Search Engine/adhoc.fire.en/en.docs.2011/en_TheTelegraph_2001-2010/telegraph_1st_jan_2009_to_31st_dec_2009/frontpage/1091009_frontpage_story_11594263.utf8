The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Weather scuttles Sonia trip
                                                                                                           Weather scuttles Sonia trip
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                               
	Itanagar, Oct. 8: The ruling Congress in Arunachal Pradesh was today left struggling against the combined forces of strong winds of changing political equations and heavy rain which resulted in UPA chairperson Sonia Gandhi having to cancel her visit to the state.         
	The cancellation of Sonias visit to Upper Subansiri and West Siang districts to campaign for party candidates comes two days after bad weather scuttled a similar trip by her son Rahul Gandhi.         
	Chief minister Dorjee Khandu put up a brave front this evening despite the twin setbacks. However, party insiders admitted that the Congress had been relying heavily on the two Gandhis to prop up its prospects for the October 13 elections, dented as the party is by desertions by senior leaders and sitting legislators who were denied tickets.         
	The party, which has put up candidates in all the 60 seats, has already pocketed three with the candidates, including Khandu, winning uncontested.         
	However, in the other seats, the party is facing tough fights from several parties, including the NCP, the Trinamul Congress, the BJP and the Peoples Party of Arunachal Pradesh.         
	What is frustrating for the Congress is that the other parties managed to push through their star campaigners before the weather turned foul.         
	While the NCP saw both P.A. Sangma and his Union minister daughter Agatha tour the districts over five days, several national leaders of the Trinamul Congress also campaigned for their party candidates.         
	Congress workers and supporters were left dejected at Daporijo and Aalo, the two places where Sonia was scheduled to address rallies today.         
	The general ground at Daporijo was spruced up over the past few days to welcome her but supporters had to return sullen-faced. All our efforts and hard work went in vain. We had kept our fingers crossed and yesterdays sunshine had provided a glimmer of hope. We thought Soniaji would be able to land and address the rally but we have no answer to the weathers vagaries, said Arunachal Pradesh Mahila Congress president, Yari Dulom, who is contesting from Daporijo.         
	The mood at West Siang district headquarters, Aalo, was also sombre. Party banners and life-size posters of Sonia that dotted the rally ground were the damp spectators at a deserted venue.         
	The skies opened up in the morning and played a total spoilsport, Hoksum Ori, a zilla parishad member and an ardent supporter of the party candidate from Aalo East, Jarkar Gamlin, said.         
	Back in Itanagar, Khandu said, We will definitely get 40 to 45 seats. The Opposition parties dont even have a sniffing chance of putting up a fight against the Congress.

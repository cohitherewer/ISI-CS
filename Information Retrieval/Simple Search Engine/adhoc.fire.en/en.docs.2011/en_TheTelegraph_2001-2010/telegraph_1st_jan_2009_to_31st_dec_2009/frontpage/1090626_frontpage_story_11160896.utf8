          OUR CORRESPONDENT                            Nilekani                                  
	New Delhi, June 25: Nandan Nilekani, the 54-year-old co- chairman of Infosys, has decided to step down from the board of the software giant and take charge of the worlds largest biometric ID card project.        
	Nilekani will take over as chairman of the Unique Identification Authority of India (UIAI)  an organisation that will hand out the ID cards to the one billion-plus people in the country. He will enjoy the rank of a cabinet minister.        
	His resignation from Infosys is effective from July 9.        
	The project will give every Indian a permanent unique identity card. It will carry a 16-digit unique ID number, a photograph and biometric data that will provide financial, educational and health-related information on the cardholder.        
	Prime Minister Manmohan Singh had invited Nilekani to head the project. I decided to take up the project in the interests of the nation, said Nilekani, one of the founders of Infosys.        
	S. Gopalakrishnan, the companys managing director and chief executive officer, said the company had not decided on Nilekanis successor. Infosys chairman and chief mentor N.R. Narayana Murthy told a television channel that no one would replace Nilekani, probably suggesting the post of co-chairman would be scrapped.        
	The government is hoping to try out the system and issue the first series of the cards by the middle of next year.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Liberals fell Obamas Gupta
                                                                                                           Liberals fell Obamas Gupta
  - Doctor pulls out after waking up to wifes pregnancy          K.P. NAYAR                            Gupta                                        
	Washington, March 6: Indian American Sanjay Guptas brief and disastrous foray into public life here was like a newcomer to the BJP taking the RSS head on.        
	Two months after it became public that Gupta had been tapped by US President Barack Obama to take up the Office of the Surgeon General, one of the more hallowed institutions of the American establishment, CNNs chief medical correspondent last night announced his withdrawal from consideration.        
	The Telegraph had reported earlier that Guptas choice as Surgeon General, which had Indian Americans delirious with joy, was falling by the wayside.        
	With Gupta withdrawing from consideration, it is the liberals across America who are gleeful that their campaign against him has been successful.        
	The union of the public health services commissioned officers, whom Gupta would have led as Surgeon General, also opposed his selection citing his lack of public health experience or qualifications.        
	This would be akin to appointing the Army Chief of Staff from the City Council of Hoboken (a town in New Jersey), Gerard Farrell, executive director of the union, had told the media in January.        
	When George W. Bush was President and the prospect was nowhere in sight of Gupta one day becoming the chief spokesperson of a Democratic presidency in Washington on matters of public health, the Indian American had taken on a bete noire of Bush, the liberal film-maker Michael Moore.        
	Gupta, a flag-bearer  unintended perhaps  of Americas reviled medical and health care companies, did a TV programme lambasting Moores highly acclaimed film, Sicko, which exposed the stark truths about Americas dysfunctional health care system.        
	The two men famously squared off on more than one TV programme, Moore going beyond Guptas views of health care and questioning the very way the American media failed to challenge Bush and the war on Iraq.        
	An example from Moore on CNN: I saw Dr. Sanjay Gupta over there embedded with the troops at the beginning of the war. He and the others of you in the mainstream media refused to ask our leaders the hard questions and demand the honest answers. And that is why we are in this war  we are in the fifth year of this war because you and CNN, Dr. Gupta, you didnt do your jobs back then and now here we are in this mess.        
	Last night, announcing his withdrawal on CNNs Larry King Live, Gupta, a consummate TV reporter, let many jaws drop when he gave his reason for withdrawing: My wife is imminent with our third child. You know, this job... takes us away from our children for so many years at once. And I just didnt feel like I should do that now, Gupta told Larry King.        
	Viewers could not help wondering if Guptas wife had an instant pregnancy, like fast food, and that he did not realise that his wife would deliver a baby any day now when Obama settled on him for the job two months ago.

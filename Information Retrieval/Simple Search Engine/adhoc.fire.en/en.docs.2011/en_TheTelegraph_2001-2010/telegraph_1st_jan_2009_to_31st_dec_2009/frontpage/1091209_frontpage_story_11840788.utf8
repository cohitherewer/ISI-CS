	London, Dec. 8: Shakira, the pop star, has spoken of her shock at being asked to occupy the same Oxford Union stage as luminaries including Winston Churchill, admitting: Im no Mother Teresa.        
	The Colombian-born singer said it was a privilege to be speaking in front of the 400 Oxford University students at the world-famous debating society, as others including the Dalai Lama have done.        
	She kept the students, many of whom had queued in the rain for more than an hour to catch a glimpse of the 5 feet 3 inches singer, waiting for 20 minutes before her half-hour appearance.        
	The 32-year-old Grammy Award winner, wrapped up for the cold weather in a coral pink dress and black cardigan, said: It is a privilege to be here today, that you have afforded me this opportunity for me to speak to you.        
	To laughter and mock booing from the audience, Shakira, known for her dancing, added: I must admit I am somewhat mystified as to why you are here, as there wont be any singing or any hip shaking whatsoever.        
	So how do I go from Barranquilla, Colombia, to occupy the same stage as Newton and Churchill? Lord knows Im no Mother Teresa.        
	The singer, who has hinted at wanting to start a family with boyfriend Antonio De La Rua, spoke of the importance of children and told the audience she hoped to have her own within the next 10 years.

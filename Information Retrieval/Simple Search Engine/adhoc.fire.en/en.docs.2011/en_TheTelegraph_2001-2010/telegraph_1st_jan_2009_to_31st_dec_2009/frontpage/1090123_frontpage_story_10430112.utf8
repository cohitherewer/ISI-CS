The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Volunteer view of inaugural
                                                                                                           Volunteer view of inaugural
          LUBICA HAUSWALDOVA                            Americans celebrate in Washington after Barack Obama was sworn in as the 44th US President. (AP)                                  
	On January 20, 9 hours and 34 minutes after Barack Obama became Americas first black President, my BlackBerry flashed the following text message: You helped to make this Inauguration Day a huge success. You were part of history. Thanks again for all your hard work. Sincerely, PIC volunteer team.        
	These words of thanks came from the presidential inauguration committee of Barack Obama.        
	I had already campaigned in Virginia for his election last year. It appeared natural to do it again for the day when all those efforts came to their ceremonial culmination.        
	At the end of a training session in the first January weekend, we got a Volunteer Information Manual, a Volunteer Courtesy Guide, a bright red winter hat embroidered with the words Presidential Inaugural 2009 VOLUNTEER and  characteristic of the now famous high-tech Obama world  a sheet with instructions to join our respective text message group. I was to text VM to 56333 to connect.         
	We also received our badges with inauguration insignia, inauguration slogan Renewing America Together and our allotted numbers. Mine: National Mall Volunteer 2659. One of 15,000 volunteers for four days of the Obama inaugural festivities, ready to donate time and work and endure some discomfort for this new US President, who were inspired to look for something bigger than their individual selves.         
	Fifteen thousand of us! And we considered ourselves lucky or even the chosen ones because there had been more than 80,000 applications in the run-up to the inauguration.        
	And speak about discomfort! Our group was to meet at 5am near the Mall. The first text message came at 4:42am: Thanks for volunteering today! Its time to wake up. Dress for warmth, be positive, smile and greet the crowds  We are making history. Thanks again.        
	However, by that time I was already on the way. To get to the Mall on time from my place meant getting up at 3am, stepping out into the freezing darkness of a winter morning of northern latitudes, enduring a ride in an unbelievably packed underground train (imagine overcrowded Indian trains or buses) and walking several blocks to our meeting point.        
	The Obama people do not forget to help their volunteers whenever possible: we were given hand warmers to insert into gloves, vouchers for hot drinks and some food from the vendor stands around, and welcomed breaks to enjoy some comfort in a warming tent with chairs and heaters.        
	My team No. 23 was as diverse as Obama supporters across America: team leader Chris was a young white man, Sharon was a black female Washington resident, Nancy a well-dressed white woman from Virginia suburbs. Sue Ellen brought two young daughters with her, Pawan came to the US as a child 19 years ago with his Indian parents, two Aishas, mother and daughter, were originally from Guinea         
	Apart from greeting people coming to see the first black President being sworn in, we were to help manage the crowds in general, assist non-Washingtonians to find their way around, direct people in need of medical assistance to the First Aid tents and particularly look after the part of the Mall reserved for disabled Americans.         
	The fenced area had a floor covering to make it easy to enter with a wheel-chair and to work as a kind of insulation from the frozen soil as well. And folding chairs for people with walkers, canes or difficulties to stand for longer time.         
	Before the start of the official programme came a sign-language translator to translate the words of the presidential oath and inauguration speech for the deaf and the hearing impaired. I was impressed with the arrangements.        
	 However, I wondered whether the disabled were going to face the freezing temperatures for several long hours.         
	It was awfully cold! So badly cold that a fellow volunteer had to leave when the younger of her girls was constantly shivering, tears rolling down her cheeks.         
	However, the first attendees arrived while it was still dark. Three African-American ladies in wheelchairs warmly dressed in several layers of clothes, hooded parkas and blankets wrapped around their legs. A veteran who lost his legs to a war was wearing a knitted ski-mask. They were followed by many others and the area soon filled up. No more chairs were available.         
	By that time the entire Mall was crowded and packed with hundreds of thousands of excited people, cheerful despite freezing temperatures. Our main task of the moment was to resolutely defend a small empty space before the pen with the disabled so that they could see the giant TV screens from their sitting positions.         
	And there was a feeling of satisfaction when we overheard the talk between a local journalist and the people in our charge praising the work we were doing.        
	Now our mobiles and BlackBerries came to use, too, according to plans: more text messages about the situation, information about relatively unpacked spaces to direct crowds there, opening and closing check-points and exits in the fences that were erected around the National Mall and other useful information for the work with the crowd.        
	There was some task to do after the official programme ended. The huge human wave rolled to the exits. Many non-Washingtonians were completely lost in the midst of the whirlpool of thousands of people around and unable to find their way out towards the metro stations.         
	Then came the goodbyes, good wishes and hugs. Barack Obama had become the President, our work was over, maybe well see each other in some of the next campaigns        
	And maybe even earlier! In the spirit of the Obama team, yesterday I got a new text message: Starting today, we must pick ourselves up, dust ourselves off, and begin again work of remaking America  President Barack Obama.

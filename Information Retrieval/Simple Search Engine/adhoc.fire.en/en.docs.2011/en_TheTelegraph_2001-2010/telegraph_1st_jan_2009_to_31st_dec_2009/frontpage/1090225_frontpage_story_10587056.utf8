          A STAFF REPORTER                               
	Guwahati, Feb. 24: A mob went on the rampage after a vehicle ran over a schoolteacher and his son at Damdama in Hajo under Kamrup district today, prompting the police to fire in the air.        
	The police said a speeding Tata Sumo knocked down Hiranya Sarma, 56, and his son, Himan Jyoti Bharadwaj, a Class III student of Navodaya Jatiya Vidyalaya, in front of Damdama College at 9am.        
	Sarma, hailing from Gerua village in Hajo and a teacher at Sesamukh Madhyamik Vidyalaya, was on his way to drop his son off at the school when the vehicle hit the bicycle they were riding.        
	It was a horrific accident. The Tata Sumo hit and dragged both father and son to a distance.         
	The body of the teacher was crushed and his guts were spilled out on to the road, the sight of which infuriated the mob.         
	The father died on the spot while the son breathed his last a few minutes after the accident, Pradip Kalita, whose house is situated close by, said.        
	Giving vent to their pent-up anger over reckless driving on the Guwahati-Hajo-Barpeta route, the people thrashed the driver and set the Guwahati-bound Tata Sumo on fire.         
	Hundreds gathered at the site and blocked the road till 3pm.         
	When a police team reached the spot to rescue the driver and control the crowd, the mob threw stones at it, injuring at least five personnel, including Rangia sub-divisional police officer Sanjukta Parashar.         
	A police van was also damaged.         
	As the situation started spinning out of control, senior police and civil officials, including additional superintendent of police (headquarters) Swapnanil Deka, reached the spot with reinforcement.         
	The police resorted to lathicharge and the administration called in the CRPF, but the people refused to retreat.         
	Sensing more trouble, the police resorted to firing in the air to disperse the crowd and the security personnel lobbed tear gas shells.         
	Kamrup superintendent of police Debajit Hazarika said the security men fired only a few rounds of rubber bullets in the air and not a single real bullet was used.         
	The police also claimed that mild force was used to defuse the situation, but witnesses alleged that several people sustained minor injuries during the lathicharge.        
	The police had not been able to ascertain the identity of the driver, who was seriously injured in the mob assault, till this afternoon.         
	He was shifted to a hospital in an unconscious condition. His condition remains critical, a Hajo police official said.

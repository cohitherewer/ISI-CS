The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Hung House puts big boys at Soren mercy

          SUMAN K. SHRIVASTAVA IN RANCHI AND OUR DELHI BUREAU                                              
	Dec. 23: The Jharkhand elections have thrown up a hung House, tossing the Congress and the BJP at the mercy of Shibu Soren who was considered a political liability in Delhi.        
	The Congress-JVM, an alliance between the national party and former BJP chief minister Babulal Marandi, has emerged as the largest block with 25 MLAs in the 81-member House. The Congress has improved its individual tally from nine seats in 2005 to 14 now.        
	But Sorens Jharkhand Mukti Morcha (JMM) has upset the calculations of all other players by bagging as many as 18 seats.         
	The tally is only one more than the JMMs 2005 figure but the jigsaw has been carved in such a way that no group can hope to have a stable government without the support of the 18 MLAs, unless Sorens flock breaks ranks. (See chart)        
	The Congress now faces the unpalatable prospect of bargaining with Soren who had been forced to resign from the first UPA ministry after being convicted in a murder case in 2006.         
	Soren was acquitted on appeal a year later but was not taken back into the ministry, apparently because of the reservations of the Prime Minister whose stress on scandal-free governance is well known.        
	If the Congress eventually allies with Soren, the party will have to find a way to reconcile compulsions of power politics with the ideals of Manmohan Singh. Since Soren has been acquitted in the murder case and there is no legal hurdles to him becoming chief minister, the Congress may cite the clean chit in its defence.        
	The BJP found no break from its relentless chain of election setbacks, its count plunging to 18 seats from 30 last time.        
	During the day, the BJP had almost pulled itself out of the power play. But the JMMs lynchpin role and the possibility of a tug-of-war between Soren and Marandi for the chief ministers chair appeared to have emboldened the BJP to keep its options open.        
	The JMM has already said it would support only those who would favour Shibu Soren as chief minister.        
	The demand will pose a big headache for the Congress which cannot ignore Marandi whose JVM has won 11 seats.         
	Soren pulled off the seemingly impossible by doing a Mayavati in Jharkhand. He gave tickets to as many as 40 non-tribals, four Muslims and backward class nominees in a bid to shed the JMMs aggressive pro-tribal image.         
	The JMM also reached out to former Maoists, one of whom  Paulus Surin  won from Torpa.        
	Lalu Prasad, nursing wounds carved by the Congress, did his bit by contributing five seats  three fewer than that in 2005  to the unofficial UPA tally.

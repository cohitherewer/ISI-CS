                                                                                                           Big bucks for vote winners       Rural, minority ministries gain
          CITHARA PAUL                  
	New Delhi, July 6: The budget has rewarded the minority affairs and rural development ministries for apparently delivering large slices of rural and Muslim votes into the Congresss kitty in the Lok Sabha polls.        
	The first UPA governments flagship National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme, managed by the rural development ministry, has witnessed a 144 per cent jump in allocation. The minority ministry has got a 74 per cent hike overall. (See chart)        
	We expected this windfall since the higher-ups in the government wholeheartedly believe that the rural job guarantee scheme played a crucial role in bringing the Congress government back, a senior rural development ministry official said.        
	An official of the minority ministry, whose formation in 2006 is said to have created enormous Muslim goodwill for the Congress, said: We are very excited. We have got even more than we had sought. We have been witnessing a drastic change in attitude towards us since the elections.        
	The official said the allocation hike should send out another reassuring message to the minorities. The ministry, which had a budget of Rs 500 crore in 2006, now has one of Rs 1,740 crore.        
	Finance minister Pranab Mukherjee, in an apparent effort to win more minority voters over from the Left, has chosen the Red bastions of Kerala and Bengal to set up new campuses of Aligarh Muslim University. The government will provide Rs 25 crore each for the campuses at Murshidabad and Malappuram.        
	Announcing Rs 39,100 crore for the rural job scheme, Mukherjee said: The NREGA has been a magnificent success for more than 4.47 crore households during 2008-09.        
	He also proposed a convergence of the rural job scheme with other schemes relating to agriculture, forest, water resources, land resources and rural roads  a persistent demand of several state governments. This would allow the states to hand out NREGA jobs under these other schemes.        
	A total of 115 districts have been selected for such convergence in the first phase. The rural development ministry will work out the details of the convergence.        
	Mukherjee announced no new schemes under the rural development and minority ministries but all their ongoing schemes have received more funds.        
	The Indira Awaas Yojana, which aims to provide houses to below-poverty-line (BPL) rural families, has seen a 63 per cent hike to Rs 8,883 crore. A further Rs 2,000 crore has been earmarked for rural housing under the National Housing Bank. This will boost the resource base of the National Housing Bank for its re-finance operations in the rural housing sector, Mukherjee said.        
	Bharat Nirman gets a 45 per cent hike. The programme covers six rural schemes, including roads, drinking water and sanitation.        
	The Pradhan Mantri Gram Sadak Yojana gets Rs 12,000 crore, up by 59 per cent from last year. Ministry sources said all rural settlements with populations of 500 and above  250 and above in hill states and tribal or desert areas  would now be provided with all-weather road connectivity.        
	The Swarna Jayanti Swarojgar Yojana has been renamed National Rural Livelihood Mission to make it universal, more focused and time-bound for poverty alleviation by 2014, Mukherjee said.        
	Under this mission, the government plans to enrol 50 per cent of all rural women in self-help groups (SHGs) over the next five years.        
	The corpus for SHGs has been raised from Rs 100 crore to Rs 500 crore.        
	Besides, rural clusters are to be set up in Bengal and Rajasthan to enhance the skills of artisans.        
	Mukherjee said the government would soon publicise a draft of the food security (guarantee) bill and seek comments from everybody before finalising it. The Congresss poll manifesto promised 25kg of rice or wheat a month at Rs 3 a kg to BPL families.

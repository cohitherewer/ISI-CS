          G.S. RADHAKRISHNA AND SANJAY K. JHA                      Telangana supporters attack buses in Hyderabad on Wednesday night. (PTI)                                
	Dec. 23: Andhra Pradesh was on the edge tonight after the Centre stressed on the need for wide-ranging consultations on Telangana, which created an impression that statehood was being put on the backburner, triggered calls for a 48-hour bandh and prompted vandalism in some parts.        
	Around 2,000 students poured out from Hyderabads Osmania University  a source of youth power that sustained the current movement for statehood  and targeted vehicles and shut down ATM kiosks after Union home minister P. Chidambaram read out a statement in Delhi.         
	Infuriated, Telangana spearhead K. Chandrasekhar Rao called the two-day bandh in the 10-district Telangana region and faxed his resignation as MP to the Lok Sabha Speaker.        
	A chain of resignation letters followed from MLAs representing the Telangana region but cutting across party lines. By Wednesday midnight, the number of the quit letters stood at 57, out of which 24 are from the Congress.        
	Earlier, 137 anti-Telangana MLAs had sent similar letters, the fate of which is yet to be decided, which means 194 members or 65 per cent of the 295-member House have put in their papers till now.        
	Prohibitory orders have been clamped in Hyderabad and two other districts in the Telangana region. Sporadic sectarian attacks on property were also reported in some areas.        
	The statement by Chidambaram did not have any explicit indication of a rollback of the December 9 midnight announcement about initiating the process for Telangana. But the odour of a delay hung heavy over the statement which pointed out that the consensus situation in Andhra Pradesh had altered.        
	At a meeting of all political parties convened by the chief minister of Andhra Pradesh on December 7, 2009, a consensus emerged on the question of formation of a separate state of Telangana. A statement was made on behalf of the central government on December 9, 2009, on receipt of the minutes of the meeting. However, after the statement, the situation in Andhra Pradesh has altered.         
	Chidambaram added: A large number of political parties are divided on the issue. There is a need to hold wide-ranging consultations with all political parties and groups in the state. The Government of India will take steps to involve all concerned in the process.        
	The home minister also appealed to the people of the different regions of Andhra Pradesh and to all political parties and students to withdraw their agitation and maintain peace, harmony and brotherhood.         
	Some Congress leaders insisted that nothing had changed but another said: The entire process is now dependent on consensus. The Centre, by legitimising the altered stands of political parties, has shown its willingness to change its stance.        
	 He added that the Centre appeared to have compounded the December 9 mistake through the fresh statement and should have avoided saying anything except appealing for peace.        
	However, under intense pressure from pro- and anti-Telangana lobbies, the Congress appeared to have settled for a tightrope walk that statehood supporters are refusing to buy.        
	The statement was drawn up after a meeting of Pranab Mukherjee, Chidambaram, A.K. Antony, M. Veerappa Moily and Ahmed Patel. PTI reported that the draft was taken to Congress president Sonia Gandhi and Prime Minister Manmohan Singh. After final touches by Singh, Chidambaram made the statement public.

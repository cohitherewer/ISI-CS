          OUR CORRESPONDENT                                    
	Shillong, March 15: The political crisis in Meghalaya deepened further with Speaker Bindo Lanong today issuing a notice to NCP legislator and Deputy Speaker Sanbor Shullai, asking him to explain why he does not fall under the purview of the anti-defection law. The Speaker was acting on a complaint filed by NCP parliamentary secretary John Manner Marak.         
	According to the complaint, Shullai had been holding meetings with the Congress and even tried to lure other NCP members to join the Congress fold. Because of the exigency of time, I have asked Shullai to respond to the showcause notice by 4.30pm tomorrow, the Speaker told The Telegraph.         
	With this, five legislators who had earlier supported the Meghalaya Progressive Alliance had been served with showcause notices.         
	The Speaker yesterday served notices to Khun Hynniewtrep National Awakening Movement legislator Paul Lyngdoh and Hill State Peoples Democratic Party leader Adviser Pariong for deserting the MPA and violating the spirit of the coalition government. Both the legislators will have to reply to the Speaker by Monday afternoon.         
	Earlier on Thursday, the Speaker issued showcause notices to Independent legislators Ismail Marak and Limison Sangma for deserting the MPA.         
	The Speaker said though both the legislators had submitted their replies yesterday, he had not taken any decision.         
	According to NCP leaders, Shullai has been abstaining from the meetings of the MPA ever since the two Independent legislators deserted the alliance. The only reply from Shullai was that he was undergoing medical treatment in Guwahati, which according to the NCP leaders is an excuse to be with the Congress.         
	Sources in the MPA said if the Speaker suspended the voting rights of the five legislators, on the day of floor test on Tuesday, it would weaken the efforts of the Congress to form an alternative government. Moreover, there is a claim from the NCP camp that five Congress legislators had contacted NCP leader P.A. Sangma, assuring him that they would abstain from voting on Tuesday.         
	Senior Congress leader Charles Pyngrope alleged that this was a creation of the MPA to confuse the Congress.         
	According to the Speaker, the fate of the members who abstain from voting would depend on complaints from the respective political parties.         
	CLP leader D.D. Lapang said the rumours that the five legislators would abstain from voting on Tuesday was an attempt by vested interests to create a misunderstanding.        
	I have checked with everyone. We are moving in a positive way and we will prove the majority, he added.

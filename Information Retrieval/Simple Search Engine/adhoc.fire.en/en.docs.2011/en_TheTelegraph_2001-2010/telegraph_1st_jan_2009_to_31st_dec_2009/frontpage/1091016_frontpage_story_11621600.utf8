          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Mumbai, Oct. 15: Mukesh Ambani has taken a 66 per cent pay cut, 10 days after corporate affairs minister Salman Khursheed advised companies to stop paying vulgar salaries to their chief executives.        
	Ambanis total compensation package for 2008-09 will shrink to Rs 15 crore from Rs 44.02 crore in the previous year.        
	The Reliance Industries honcho expressed a desire to set a personal example of moderation in executive compensation, the company said in a statement today. He was responding to calls for austerity in executive pay that were first orchestrated by Prime Minister Manmohan Singh in May 2007.        
	The remuneration committee of the board of Reliance Industries met recently and decided to cap Ambanis compensation at Rs 15 crore in response to his wish.        
	The committee also decided to adopt a capped structure method to decide the compensation packages of top executives in Reliance Industries from now on.         
	Under the Companies Act of 1956, the top manager in a company  in this case Mukesh Ambani  can be paid up to 5 per cent of the net profits of the company. The overall remuneration that can be paid to top managers is capped at 10 per cent of net profits.        
	In April 2008, shareholders of Reliance Industries extended Ambanis tenure as chairman and managing director by five years. They also approved a monthly salary of Rs 5 lakh and perquisites and allowances of another Rs 4 lakh. In addition, he was entitled to a commission on the net profits and fees for attending board meetings. All of these components were clubbed under the 5 per cent cap.        
	From now on, compensation at RIL will no longer be decided on the basis of the percentage of net profits. The absolute limit on compensation will depend on that years performance and reflect the executives contribution. It will remain motivational for enhanced performance, and yet (stay) within reasonable limits, the release said.        
	Brother Anil Ambani is one of the highest paid chief executives in the country and earned over Rs 52 crore from his five listed companies. The rules allow a top executive to draw his remuneration from more than one company but the overall sum has to be within the 5 per cent cap of any one company.        
	None of the top companies in India pay anywhere near the 5 per cent limit  a limit that was set more than 50 years ago when companies earned lowball profits.        
	Until now, Reliance Industries had internally pegged the managerial remuneration payable to Mukesh Ambani and his two cousins  Nikhil and Hital Meswani  at 0.402 per cent of the net profits. Of this, Mukesh Ambani got Rs 44 crore, or 0.23 per cent of the net profits of Rs 19,458 crore in 2007-08.        
	The compensation of Rs 15 crore is 98 per cent lower than the limit of 5 per cent of net profits, the company said in the media release.        
	In 2008-09, RIL earned a net profit of Rs 15,637 crore and 5 per cent of this sum amounted to Rs 805 crore after taking into account the various permissible setoffs.

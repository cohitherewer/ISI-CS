                                                                                                           Talks stuck as Jet opposes pilot guild 
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                            A Jet Airways traveller stranded at Mumbai airport                                  
	New Delhi, Sept. 11: Talks between Jet Airways pilots and the airline management to end a four-day strike remained deadlocked over the airlines refusal to allow a pilots guild to be formed.        
	The pilots led by Girish Kaushik and a Jet team headed by Saroj Dutta remained closeted with the chief labour commissioner for about seven hours today to try and end the impasse.         
	We will continue talks in Mumbai tomorrow, pilots will remain off duty for now. Hopefully we can wrap up the talks and get back (to work) in a day or two, said Kaushik.         
	During the talks, Jet made it clear it was willing to take back the sacked pilots but would make it conditional on the pilots union, the National Aviation Guild, being de-registered.         
	The pilots argued that it was a constitutional right to form a union.The talks were held in the backdrop of nearly 200 flights being either cancelled or combined by Jet for a fourth day.         
	Over the past four days, some 850 Jet Airways flights have been affected.        
	The strike was called after members some pilots sacked over forming the National Aviation Guild and registering it as a trade union with the Mumbai labour commissioner.         
	The pilots and the management came face to face for talks for the first time on Wednesday.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Congress pays Lalu back in same coin
                                                                                                           Congress pays Lalu back in same coin
  - 7:5 seat deal sealed with JMM in state        RADHIKA RAMASESHAN AND SUMAN K. SHRIVASTAVA                                          
	March 18: A day after Lalu Prasads put-down in Bihar, the Congress got even with the RJD chief in neighbouring Jharkhand.        
	Like him, it unilaterally announced the UPAs seats in the state, leaving only two for the RJD and none for Ram Vilas Paswans Lok Janshakti Party (LJP).        
	The JMM was an unwitting beneficiary of the Congress-RJD spat because it got one seat more than what was originally earmarked for it. The Congress too pocketed an extra seat from the two that were given to the CPI in 2004 when the Left had an electoral arrangement with it and the RJD.        
	K. Keshava Rao, the Congress functionary in charge of Jharkhand, announced at a news conference that the Congress would contest seven, the JMM five and the RJD two seats in Jharkhand. Lalu was initially made to believe he would get three and the JMM four.        
	Asked if Lalu was given his comeuppance, Rao told The Telegraph: It is a principled arrangement. We have given the sitting MPs their seats. We have not reacted to what happened in Bihar but they (the RJD) must learn to reciprocate. An alliance is not a political business, it is a meeting of minds and a true friendship to give a fight to forces that are inimical to our ideology.        
	He justified the denial of seats to the LJP, saying Paswan had no votes in the state because the Dalit votes went mostly to Babulal Marandis Jharkhand Vikas Morcha (Prajatantrik).        
	Lalu and Paswan are yet to react to the Congresss riposte to their tat.        
	According to the module, JMM chief Shibu Soren would also contest the Jamtara Assembly by-election.         
	Congress state president Pradeep Balmuchu said that there was no decision on the remaining two seats  Palamau and Chatra. Both the seats are represented by RJD in the Lok Sabha.         
	Yesterday, Lalu and Ram Vilas Paswan announced that RJD and LJP would contest 25 and 12 seats, respectively, in Bihar, leaving only three seats to the Congress where it had won in 2004 also.        
	Though the Congress leaders were not ready to comment on the UPA alliance, they had admitted in private that the alliance with the RJD was over. There is no question of alliance in Jharkhand after Lalu betrayed us in Bihar. We will contest the remaining two seats too if the RJD did not agree to our formula, said a senior Congress leader, holding seat-sharing talks with alliance partners.        
	The formula was reached at a meeting between Soren and AICC general secretary in charge of Jharkhand K. Keshav Rao. Others present at the meeting included JMM MP Hemlal Murmu, Hemant Soren, Balmuchu, Abdul Mannan and Manoj Yadav.        
	Hemant, Shibus son, said the deal was final. Now it is for the Congress to hold talks with the RJD. We have rightfully got five seats, he added.        
	Feeling that the UPA alliance was over for all practical purposes, RJD leaders said Lalu was upset with the unilateral agreement reached between the Congress and the JMM and had decided to hit back by aligning with Paswan. Paswan said in Delhi today that the party wanted to contest elections under alliance with the UPA partners. However, we are ready to contest six constituencies if the seat-sharing deal is not through.        
	LJP state president Hidayatullah Khan said the party wanted Koderma seat under seat adjustments. The exercise is on to work out a seat adjustment formula. We will contest eight seats if the talks over seat adjustments fail.        
	Lalu had said at a news conference yesterday that he would have an alliance with LJP in Jharkhand too. Paswans LJP is not a part of the UPA trio (Congress-JMM-RJD) in Jharkhand.        
	State RJD chief Gautam Sagar Rana said he was not aware of the partys strategy in the changed political scenario.         
	In fact, Lalu was said to be upset with the earlier seat-sharing formula, too, mainly piloted by Murmu.         
	The Congress and JMM had then announced an arrangement on 12 of the 14 seats in Jharkhand, on the formula of sitting MPs getting tickets.         
	At present, the Congress has six sitting MPs, the JMM four and the RJD two. They had kept the decision over two seats  Hazaribagh and Koderma  pending. The RJD also wanted to contest Koderma and Jamshedpur.         
	Soren said JMM sitting MPs would contest from their respective seats.

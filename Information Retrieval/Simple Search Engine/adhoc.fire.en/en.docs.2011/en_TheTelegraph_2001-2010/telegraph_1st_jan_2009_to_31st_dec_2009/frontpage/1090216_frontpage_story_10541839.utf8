  - 70th session opens with promise to save tribal languages          DIPEN BORA                                          
	Dhemaji, Feb. 15: Assams influential literary organisation, the Asam Sahitya Sabha, today opened its 70th session with a plea to shun suspicion and a promise to save tribal languages from extinction.        
	Kanak Sen Deka, the sabhas president, unveiled the organisations literary plans after inaugurating the session at Dhemaji today.         
	The sabha decided to extend all possible help to develop ethnic and indigenous languages of the region and sought co-operation from all in its endeavour.         
	Hoisting the sabha flag, Deka said the organisation has always helped preserve and promote tribal languages of state.         
	It will be wrong to perceive that tribal languages of the state will become extinct because of the crisis they are facing today. A language, too, like human beings evolves through challenges, Deka said, adding that even Assamese languages passed through crises.         
	Shunning the atmosphere of suspicion and mistrust, we should work together, he appealed to all.         
	Though the registration of members began yesterday, the session formally began today with the inauguration of various segments at the Sukapha Pathar Samanmay.         
	The delegates camp was opened by Dhemaji deputy commissioner P. Ashok Babu yesterday.         
	Eighteen books and a few other literary works will be released during the five-day session.        
	The venue saw congregation of several thousand people in ethic attire today.         
	Amiya Kumar Bhuyan, secretary general of the reception committee, said a few lakh visitors are expected everyday over the next few days. Over 5,000 delegates from India and abroad will be part of the conference.         
	Keeping in mind the increased flow of visitors to Dhemaji over the next few days, security has been beefed up in the district.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Politburo at graft gunpoint 
                                                                                                           Politburo at graft gunpoint 
  - Governor nod to try   Kerala CPM boss        JOHN MARY AND CITHARA PAUL                            Karat (top), Vijayan                                             
	June 7: Kerala CPM secretary Pinarayi Vijayan has become the first politburo member to be staring at possible prosecution for corruption, rattling a party that wears its leaders perceived incorruptibility as a badge.        
	Kerala governor R.S. Gavai today sanctioned Vijayans prosecution in the Rs 374-crore Lavalin scandal, dealing a fresh blow to the states ruling Left after the recent Lok Sabha poll setback.        
	A CBI officer met Gavai at Raj Bhavan and received a 148-page document containing the decision that flies in the face of state cabinet advice and the advocate-generals opinion not to sanction prosecution.        
	The CPM, which claims the case is politically motivated, accused the governor of yielding to Opposition pressure. The party will fight this both legally and politically, the CPM state secretariat said, echoing politburo member M.K. Pandhe.        
	However, the Kerala home minister and Pandhes politburo colleague, Kodiyeri Balakrishnan, said: Once the sanction has been accorded, the case is before the court (which had directed the CBI probe). So we will face this legally.        
	The available politburo is to meet in Delhi tomorrow. The CPM stand is that Vijayan need not step down as state secretary since his is a party post and not a government one. However, its well known that in any CPM-ruled state, the party plays a key role in decision-making.        
	The assertion to also fight the battle politically  cadres have already started burning the governors effigy and have vowed to enforce a black day in Kerala tomorrow  poses a big test for CPM general secretary Prakash Karat.        
	If the court goes by the governors decision and orders the prosecution of Vijayan, it will not be easy for Karat and the party to tar the judiciary with the same brush of political motive. Several CPM leaders have had skirmishes with the judiciary in the past but almost all these cases were related to questions of contempt and political issues  never to corruption as is the case now.        
	The case is also expected to have an impact on the CPMs exercise to establish the reason for its dismal performance in the Lok Sabha polls. The Left tally came down to four this time from 19 of the 20 seats in 2004.        
	The faction owing allegiance to V.S. Achuthanandan, the Kerala chief minister who is locked in a bitter feud with Vijayan, can now claim that the central leadership erred in not acting on its own against Vijayan earlier, which could have helped improve the Left performance in the elections.        
	Karat is expected to have his hands full now  the controversy flaring up again at a time the party is yet to come to terms with the crushing blows in Bengal and Kerala.         
	The Congress-led UDF welcomed the decision of Gavai, a Maharashtra veteran from the Republican Party of India. The CPMs LDF allies did not react although the CPI recently said it did not believe the case was politically motivated.        
	Exactly two years ago, Vijayan had been involved in another unprecedented humiliation for any top CPM leader, when he and Achuthanandan were suspended from the politburo with a public rap for fighting each other.        
	That had been the biggest disciplinary action in the CPMs history, tarnishing its image as a regimented party.        
	Chief minister Achuthanandan declined comment today. He had earlier said Vijayan should prove his innocence in the courts but was pressured by the party into advising the governor against sanctioning prosecution.         
	The case relates to a state government contract with Canadian firm SNC Lavalin, signed when Vijayan was power minister between 1996 and 1998, for the modernisation of three hydel plants.         
	According to the CBI, Vijayan had sought cabinet approval for the contract only after signing it, and had hidden this fact from the cabinet.        
	If the big bucks involved in the deal represent Vijayans reformist side  he has changed the CPMs face in Kerala since taking over as state unit secretary in 1998  he also has a Stalinist trait, as shown by his iron grip over the organisation.         
	Under him, the CPMs financial strength has grown. Kairali TV, a party-blessed channel, was his idea. So were the string of co-operatives that provide jobs to youths from CPM families.         
	In politics too, Vijayan has been a pragmatist, looking to transform the party of the working class. He has led the CPM to pacts with the controversial Abdul Nasser Madhani.        
	After his reformist bias soured his ties with the popular Achuthanandan, Vijayan, in true Stalinist style, systematically sidelined the veterans loyalists at various party levels.The decision not to field VS in the last Assembly elections had turned him into a villain of sorts.        
	He has plenty of critics within the party who blame him for all its ills. His supporters say his only fault has been the failure to understand the importance of being popular.

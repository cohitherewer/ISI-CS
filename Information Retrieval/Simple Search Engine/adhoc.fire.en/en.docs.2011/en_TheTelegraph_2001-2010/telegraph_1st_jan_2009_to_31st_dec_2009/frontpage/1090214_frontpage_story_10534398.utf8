	Ghaziabad, Feb. 13: Moninder Singh Pandher and Surender Koli were today sentenced to death in the first of the Nithari serial killings, in a judgment that is a slap in the CBIs face.        
	No more penalty could be awarded to the accused persons, otherwise they deserve more punishment, judge Rama Jain said, ordering the Noida businessman and his servant to be hanged to death.        
	The sentence will have to be confirmed by the high court and then the Supreme Court.        
	The CBI, which asked for the death penalty for Koli, was silent on Pandher even after the court yesterday found him guilty in the rape and murder of 14-year-old Rimpa Haldar in February 2005. Whatever the court deems fit, we will accept that, the CBI counsel said.        
	In its chargesheet, the investigating agency had given a clean chit to the businessman, claiming he didnt know 19 children and young women were slaughtered in his house.         
	The judge questioned this claim. It is clear from Kolis confessional statement that he used to chop the body parts of those children and girls that he used to kill in Pandhers house. He has also said he used to dump the bodies in the drains and the back of the house. There were recoveries of bones and skulls from these areas. These recoveries werent less than those found in an abattoir. These should have stunk. How can it be said that the man who lived inside the house didnt smell anything foul and had no idea what was going on in his house? she asked.        
	Pandher, 55, sobbed as Jain read out her judgment. Koli, 38, stood calm.         
	This is a crime thats against society, against women, against the poor, and against the Constitution. This is a crime thats a blot on the face of the present generation. It is inhuman and cruel beyond words. The case falls under the rarest of rare category which does not deserve any sympathy, the judge said.        
	The manner in which the horrendous act has been carried out even puts the era into shame when there was no civilisation.        
	In his half-hour argument today, CBI counsel S.P. Ahluwalia dwelt only on Koli. Koli has no right to live in society because even today he has no remorse for his deeds. He continues to be a threat to the society, the lawyer said, adding there was no chance of reform. He was silent on Pandher, whom the CBI had cleared on the ground that he was in Australia when Rimpa was murdered.         
	But Jain said Pandhers passport was not enough proof he did not know of the crimes.         
	It is clear from Kolis confession that a girl or woman was murdered and butchered in and around the house in a space of 40 days, so in effect one body didnt rot before the other was dumped in the same place. This house should have stunk like a slaughter house, the judge wrote.         
	Pandhers family said the verdict would be challenged in Allahabad High Court.         
	But Rimpas parents were happy their daughter had got justice. God has been with us, the dead girls mother, Dolly Haldar, wept.

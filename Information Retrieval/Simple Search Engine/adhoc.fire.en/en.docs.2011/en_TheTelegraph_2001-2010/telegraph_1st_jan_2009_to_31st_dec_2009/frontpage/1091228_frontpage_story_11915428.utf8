          ANDREW ALDERSON                            A TV grab of Jasper Schuringa whose quick action on the flight foiled the terror attack. (AFP)                                   
	London, Dec. 27: Eight and a half hours after it had taken off from Amsterdam, the Airbus A330, bearing the colours of the airlines new owner, Delta, was starting its final descent into Detroit.         
	A loud popping noise  like the sound of a balloon bursting or a firecracker going off  passed through the cabin. Some passengers said they saw a flicker of light; others started to smell smoke. Some said they could see flames rising from where a young male passenger, Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab, was sitting.         
	Most of the passengers and the 11 crew were unaware that their lives were in danger. Only those close by realised the urgency of the situation.         
	A young Dutchman sitting a few rows behind Abdulmutallab, who was in 19A, leapt from his seat, pushed past other passengers and jumped on the would-be terrorist.         
	Jasper Schuringa, a video director and producer from Amsterdam, has been hailed as a hero by his fellow passengers. He said he heard a sound that reminded him of a firecracker and someone yelling: Fire! Fire!         
	But he was sure something was wrong only when he saw smoke coming from a blanket on Abdulmutallabs lap. He saw that the mans trousers were open and he was holding a burning object that resembled a small white shampoo bottle between his legs. I pulled the object from him and tried to extinguish the fire with my hands and threw it away, Schuringa said.         
	He said he screamed for water and pulled the man out of his seat, dragging him to the front of the plane.         
	Schuringa said Abdulmutallab seemed out of it and was staring into nothing.         
	To ensure that he did not have other explosives on his body, Schuringa stripped off the would-be bombers clothes. Someone, believed to have been a member of the cabin staff, produced handcuffs, which the Dutchman, with the help of a crew member, used to restrain Abdulmutallab.         
	Other passengers described a terrifying four-minute panic as five men and three women fought with a belligerent, screaming man.         
	A middle-aged male passenger said: All we heard at the beginning was a bang. It sounded first like a balloon being popped, and then a minute later there was a lady shouting things like What are you doing? What are you doing?         
	Shama Chopra, a Canadian passenger, recalled: The man was on fire and the flames were so high they almost hit the roof of the plane. I thought we were all gone.         
	Another passenger heard Abdulmutallab say the word Afghanistan, perhaps suggesting that his actions were a retaliation for the Wests invasion of that country.         
	Another said they knew there was a terrorist threat when we saw the fear in the flight attendants eyes.         
	By now, the plane was well into its descent and many of the passengers feared that the plane was on fire. It emerged later that the explosion had been caused by a mixture of liquid and powder, apparently contained in a device Abdulmutallab had hidden on his inside thigh.         
	It is believed he had mixed an explosive concoction in one of the lavatories of the plane and then attempted to detonate it a short time after returning to his seat.         
	He had apparently given other passengers no cause for concern and had not spoken to anybody. For the last 15 minutes or so of the flight, Abdulmutallab was held handcuffed at the front of the plane.         
	Schuringa said: I dont feel like a hero. It was something that came naturally  I had to do something, or it would be too late.        
	Probe on explosive        
	The affidavit on Abdulmutallab said the device he was carrying contained PETN or pentaerythritol, a highly explosive substance that was used in 2001 by Richard C. Reid, the so-called shoe bomber whose attempt to blow up a trans-Atlantic flight was thwarted. Analysis of the remnants of Abdulmutallabs device was being carried out by the FBI laboratory.

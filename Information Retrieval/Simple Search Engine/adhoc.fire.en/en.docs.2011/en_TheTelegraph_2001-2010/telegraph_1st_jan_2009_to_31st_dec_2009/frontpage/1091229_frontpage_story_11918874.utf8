  - 400 Morcha protesters arrested in Dooars        OUR CORRESPONDENT                                    
	Alipurduar, Dec. 28: Nearly 400 members of the Gorkha Janmukti Vidyarthi Morcha were arrested today with police swinging into action, not in Darjeeling district or on the national highways but in Jalpaiguri district where the hill outfit is not known to have much influence.         
	Among the arrested were many schoolchildren who had been propped up by the Gorkha Janmukti Morcha on the road connecting Bhutan to NH31 at Dalsinghpara, about 50km from here. The party has announced that the blockade timing will be extended by an hour tomorrow, starting from 10am.         
	However, Darjeeling police remained inactive with the Morchas youth wing continuing its blockades at Dagapur, on the outskirts of Siliguri, Sevoke and at Rangpo, blocking traffic for four hours on NH55, NH31 and NH31A.        
	The arrests sparked protests in Darjeeling town where Morcha members gheraoed the police station demanding the immediate release of those arrested in the Dooars. Vidyarthi Morcha general secretary Keshav Raj Pokhral said: Our members have been arrested in the Dooars and as a mark of protest we will block the highways for five hours tomorrow from 10am. Morcha general secretary Roshan Giri accused the state government of derailing a peaceful movement for statehood.         
	The duration of the roadblocks that began with three hours on Saturday is being extended by an hour each day sparking protests in the plains. Among those arrested from Dalsinghpara today was the Morcha-backed Independent MLA from Kalchini, Wilson Champromary.        
	At 1pm, the police from Jaigaon reached the spot led by its officer-in-charge, Pradeep Sarkar, and requested the picketers to remove the blockade as traffic between Bhutan and India had come to a standstill.        
	 Asked why schoolchildren were arrested, Anoop Jaiswal, the additional police superintendent of Alipurduar, said: The police arrested all blocking the road and they will be released on bail bonds.

  Govt blames mafia tactics          OUR BUREAU                             A gutted Mud Villa with a collapsed roof at Vedic Village. Picture by Amit Datta                                        
	Calcutta, Aug. 24: Weapons have been found in a labour hutment in Vedic Village and the government cast aspersions on land acquisition tactics, prising open a can of worms that tumbled out because of yesterdays arson attack on the resort.        
	Police stumbled on a cache of arms and ammunition  six improvised guns and 22 bombs and explosive devices  from the labour wing in the complex and arrested eight persons from the hutment.        
	The eight are suspected to be the henchmen of Gaffar Mollah, an alleged land shark whose brawl with a rival soccer team in a nearby field led to the death of a teenager and triggered yesterdays backlash that gutted at least 10 per cent of the establishments in the 125-acre complex. Gaffar is absconding.        
	The goons who had rushed inside the resort with guns and bombs had left the arms and ammunition in the hutment, said Raj Kishore Modi, the managing director of Vedic Realty, the promoters of the resort-cum-bungalow project.        
	Told that the weapons were placed in perfect order in the hutment, not strewn around as they would have been if left in haste by fleeing miscreants, Modi said: These are not important details.        
	Asked twice how the eight arrested could stay in the complex unnoticed for so long  the goons had allegedly rushed in before 6pm on Sunday and the police put the time of arrest at noon on Monday  Modi skipped the question.        
	Queried the third time, Modi said: We are still collecting the details. We dont have all the details of those arrested.        
	So far, 18 persons have been arrested  the eight have been charged with murder while the rest are booked for vandalism.        
	State home secretary Ardhendu Sen linked the rampage to local discontent with land sharks. I would not hesitate to say that land was being purchased at gunpoint for the project and local people didnt like that, said Sen.         
	The state government, however, had extended all help to the promoters of Vedic Village in the past few years to develop the luxury resort. The group is also developing an IT park in the area, the future of which looks uncertain now.        
	The police are looking for Gaffar Mollah and his associates, who are part of the land mafia and also have connections with Vedic Village, said the home secretary. According to Sen, the resort authorities were buying land to expand their project and Gaffar and his men were involved.         
	Vedic Realtys Modi claimed that the company had stopped acquiring a land long time ago.        
	But villagers said the land mafia was very much active in the area to scoop up land for Vedic Village. Gaffar is their main man. These people not only forced us to sell off our land, they also failed to pay the right price, said a resident of Chandpur Champagachi village.        
	Acquisition for Vedic Village started in 1999, when the price of land ranged between Rs 15,000 and Rs 20,000 per cottah. In the past few years, land prices have soared to between Rs 3 lakh and Rs 5 lakh per cottah, depending on the distance from paved road.         
	Jamir Sardar, a resident of Shikharpur village, identified himself as a victim of Gaffars muscle power. The 44-year-old said he had to part with his four-cottah-plus plot, located in Bishnupur mouza, in January 2008 under pressure from Gaffar.        
	My land was located close to the main road and the going rate then was Rs 3 lakh per cottah. But I got only Rs 1.75 lakh per cottah, said the autorickshaw driver who was a farmer till a year ago.         
	Vedic Village is built over 125 acres of land out of which 75 per cent was acquired by the promoters directly from the villagers.         
	Modi, however, said: A lot of villagers sold us their land at the prevailing rates of those times. Today the rates have gone up. Now these people are disgruntled and are trying to create unrest.

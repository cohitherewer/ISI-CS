The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | IT secret: Puja palliative
                                                                                                           IT secret: Puja palliative
          ANINDYA SENGUPTA                              
	Calcutta, Sept. 19: Chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee pressed on with his IT thrust by speaking to Azim Premji today but land provider Gautam Deb let the cat out of the bag.        
	We wanted to inform people before they board long-distance trains to spend their Puja holidays that we have tried our best to retain the two big companies in our state, said Deb, the housing minister whose Hidco has set aside 45 acres each for Infosys and Wipro after the IT township project was scrapped.        
	Debs statement confirms the perception that the government was primarily concerned about sending a feel-good message after the township fiasco, although the IT companies had conveyed that they were not in a hurry to set up campuses because of the downturn.        
	Although the chief ministers conversation with the Wipro chief was positive, there was no commitment from Premji that the company would at this moment make any further investments in Bengal, sources said. Bhattacharjee would speak to Infosys in two or three days.        
	The chief minister spoke to the Wipro chief this afternoon and told him that the Bengal government was ready to hand over 45 acres in Rajarhat, Deb told The Telegraph. Premji told the chief minister that he was happy to learn about the governments initiative. The Wipro chief was told that these 45 acres could be given to the company whenever it wants it. The chief minister found his response positive.         
	Deb said the price factor, too, was discussed but did not disclose details.        
	I had mentioned to the chief minister that TCS had got land in Rajarhat at Rs 1.5 crore an acre. Lets see what Wipro does now, Deb said. Besides, it is up to the chief minister to decide on the price. Wipro and Infosys had earlier quoted Rs 50 lakh an acre.

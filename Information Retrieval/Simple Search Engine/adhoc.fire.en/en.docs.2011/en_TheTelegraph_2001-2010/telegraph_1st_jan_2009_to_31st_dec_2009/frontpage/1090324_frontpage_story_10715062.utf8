	London, March 23: The most dangerous James Bond is Daniel Craig, research has revealed, because every woman who sleeps with him ends up dead.         
	Analysis of film scripts shows that a third of the women who succumbed to the average 007s charms were killed  many meeting their ends in gruesome and outlandish manners. Of the 51 women who slept with the on-screen spy, as many as 16 met untimely ends, according to the study.         
	In Quantum of Solace, Gemma Artertons character, the MI6 agent Strawberry Fields, met one of the stickiest ends ever for a Bond girl, by being drowned in crude oil.

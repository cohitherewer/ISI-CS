  - Sonia pleases Mamata with development punch at Left           OUR BUREAU                            Mamata with Sonia in Lalgola on Monday. (AFP)                                        
	Calcutta, April 27: They were sharing the dais after eight years but Sonia Gandhi and Mamata Banerjee did not seem to have lost any of their old warmth.        
	As they reached the dais in Murshidabads Lalgola and Sonia sat down, she pulled Mamatas chair close to hers. They were seen whispering to each other and smiling.        
	When Sonia took the mike, one of the first things she said was: Im happy to be sharing the dais with Mamata Banerjee once again.        
	And when she thundered that in Nandigram and Singur, the state government had unleashed dictatorship in the garb of democracy, there was a look of quiet satisfaction on Mamatas face.        
	In the name of development, they (the CPM) created terror in Nandigram and Singur, Sonia said. In the name of development they snatched land from the poor people there.        
	Mamata and Sonia had last shared the dais during the 2001 Assembly polls in Bengal, when the two parties had a seats deal.        
	Today, smiling at Mamata, Sonia said: The alliance (between the Congress and the Trinamul Congress) will work together to unseat the CPM from Bengal. Both the parties have decided on this.        
	Minutes earlier, Mamata had exhorted the crowd of about 50,000 at the Simantapur Maidan to vote for the Congress candidates from Murshidabad district.        
	We have to defeat the CPM. So, vote for Pranabda (Pranab Mukherjee) and vote for the other Congress candidates as well; there is no Trinamul candidate here.        
	In all the three places Sonia visited today --- Lalgola, Samsi in Malda and Islampur in Raiganj --- she underlined the theme of her son Rahuls attack on the Left Front government: failure to implement centrally sponsored projects.        
	Whereas Rahul had acquired the figures for all the districts he visited last week, making his criticism more pointed, Sonia spoke generally about the Left governments failures in this sphere.        
	While most of the states made the most of the National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme, Bengal lagged behind with only 22 days of work. It (the Left Front) has not been able to provide electricity to villages even after being in power for so many years. While most of the states have benefited from centrally sponsored schemes, Bengal has suffered because of its government. This is a shame, she said in Lalgola.        
	They use the central funds only for the benefit of their own partymen and not the poorest of the poor.        
	In Islampur, too, she said much the same thing but asked the crowd to pray for the speedy recovery of Priya Ranjan Das Munshi. His wife Deepa is contesting from Raiganj.        
	He (Priya) is a dynamic and diligent national leader and as I was nearing this venue, I felt very sad that he could not be with us here today, Sonia said. You should all pray for his speedy recovery.        
	Earlier, at Samsi, which falls in Mausam Noors Malda North constituency, Sonia brought her together with her uncle Abu Hashem Chowdhury, the Malda South candidate, who attended his nieces election rally for the first time today.        
	But while addressing the gathering, Sonia did not once mention him.        
	Mausam will work with the blessings of A.B.A. Ghani Khan Chowdhury and her mother, Ruby Noor, Sonia said, well aware of the hostility of her uncles over Abu Naser Khan Chowdhury being denied the Malda North ticket.        
	Sonia toured all three places on a helicopter before leaving for Delhi from Bagdogra late in the afternoon.        
	Biman reaction        
	Reacting to Sonias charges, Left Front chairman Biman Bose said the Congress president had parroted what she was briefed on the ground situation here.         
	Neither Sonia Gandhi nor Rahul Gandhi had visited villages in Bengal before joining the smear campaign against us. They should remember that Kalahandi happened during the Congress rule in Orissa and the poor in Purulia are living a better life than Kalahandi, or for that matter, Amethi, Bose said.

          ANANYA SENGUPTA                              
	New Delhi, Dec. 27: The family that has taken a 15-year-old murder case against Shibu Soren to the Supreme Court is shocked that he is forming the next government in Jharkhand.        
	The case against Soren isnt over yet. How can he form the government? This isnt about a minor political misconduct, but a murder case, said Vijay Nath Jha, brother of slain Shashi Nath Jha.        
	Preeti, Shashi Naths 19-year-old daughter, echoed her uncle, saying it was shocking that the tainted JMM supremo was set to assume power again.        
	In November 2006, a Delhi trial court had convicted Soren and four others for the May 1994 abduction and murder of Shashi Nath, Sorens personal secretary.         
	Soren had to quit as Union coal minister in the Manmohan Singh government after the conviction, but he was acquitted by Delhi High Court in 2007.         
	The Jhas then filed an appeal in the Supreme Court, which sent Soren notices and fixed the hearing for March next year. The notices have remained unanswered. The family alleged it was being threatened to withdraw its appeal in the apex court.        
	Disgust over the fact that parties were supping with the 65-year-old tribal leader after slamming him in the run-up to the state polls just a month ago is obvious every time the Jhas speak.        
	I am shocked at the stance of the BJP and Congress. How can they side with someone who has blood on his hands? Will Sonia Gandhi make me a minister if I kill Sorens son? asked Vijay Nath.        
	He came down harder on the BJP, pointing put that the party had described Soren as a tainted politician during the campaign and demanded action. The party, Vijay Nath said, had done an about-turn on Soren as it feared that the Congress-led UPA at the Centre would impose Presidents rule in the state if no combine was able to add up the numbers in the hung House.        
	However, this is not the first alliance between BJP and JMM, which had earlier backed the Atal Bihari Vajpayee government at the Centre for a short time.        
	Vijay Nath said the race to win over Soren for power would lead to a dangerous situation. Both Congress and BJP need Soren, so he is no longer tainted.                     
	As soon as he forms the government with one of the parties, the other will call him tainted. This is a dangerous situation for the country, he added.        
	Preeti spoke about her struggle to come to terms with her fathers death. I dont want any favours from anyone. All I want is they return my father. If he is dead, give me his body. If he is alive, send him to me. At least let us perform his last rites, she said.        
	The second-year B.Com student fears for her and her familys safety. Even though we have been fighting the case for so long, I am scared. These people (the Sorens) are so powerful that even protection of the highest level cant save us from them, she said.

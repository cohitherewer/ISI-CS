          SANJAY MANDAL                              
	Calcutta, Sept. 6: A plane belonging to the United Arab Emirates air force and its nine crew members were detained in Calcutta airport this evening for allegedly carrying arms and explosives in violation of a declaration that allowed them to land for refuelling in the city.        
	The aircraft was on its way to Hanyang in China from Abu Dhabi and had landed at Calcutta airport to refuel around 5.30pm.        
	Customs sources said the eastern regional command of the Indian Air Force had allowed the aircraft to land on the basis of a clearance (AOR 913/914) it received from the Delhi regional command.        
	Around 6.30pm, customs officials from Calcutta airport boarded the aircraft for a customary check.        
	They were shocked to find a large cache of arms, ammunition and explosives inside the aircraft and immediately informed the Airports Authority of India, police and the Central Industrial Security Force, a customs official told The Telegraph.        
	The Delhi regional command clarified on enquiry that it had issued the clearance to land for refuelling on the basis of a verbal declaration from the UAE air force that the aircraft would not carry any arms or ammunition.        
	The captain and the eight other crew members were detained and accommodated at a private luxury hotel off EM Bypass. The aircraft was sealed and parked at a bay near hangar number 14 of the airport, another customs official said.        
	At 11.30pm, the Indian Air Force cancelled the clearance it had issued to the aircraft.        
	Hanyang, the apparent destination of the plane, was one of the three cities that merged into modern-day Wuhan, the capital of the Hubei province in China. The city is known for Hanyang Arsenal which produces the Hanyang rifle  an indigenous copy of the 1888 German weapon heavily used in the Second World War and the Korean and Vietnam wars.        
	Legal proceedings against the UAE crew are scheduled to start from Monday. If the authorities press charges, the aircraft and crew will have to stay in the city till the process is completed.        
	However, on June 19, a Ukrainian aircraft, hired by the US military and carrying arms from Diego Garcia to Afghanistan, was allowed to leave after it intruded into Indian airspace and was forced to land in Mumbai.        
	The AN-124 was allowed to leave after the US embassy stepped in and senior diplomats got in touch with the external affairs ministry, saying that the intrusion was an inadvertent mistake, a source had said in June.

  - ArcelorMittal pays up to ensure 1,000 acre govt land in Kamdhara          AMIT GUPTA                                               Former chief minister   Arjun Munda with Lakshmi Mittal on the day the ArcelorMittal MoU was signed. Telegraph picture    
	Ranchi, April 28: ArcelorMittal has deposited Rs 12 crore to the state in lieu of government land for its ambitious greenfield project, indicating it wasnt about to put its Rs 40,000 crore investment plan in Jharkhand on the backburner because of the global economic meltdown.        
	The steel behemoth requires over 8,000 acre land  government and private  in the Kamdhara block of Gumla and Torpa block of Khunti for its proposed 12 MTPA steel plant, which under the given circumstances could see a scaling down.        
	According to Gumla district authorities, Rs 12.30 crore was deposited around the first week of April, for 1,000 acre to be transferred to the company in the Kamdhara block.        
	GM (mines) P.S. Prasad, the companys local representative here, confirmed the payment to the states revenue and land reforms department. The payment was indicative of Arcelor Mittals seriousness about setting up the project in Jharkhand, he said, Things got delayed and we now really want to expedite matters.        
	But the payment was also a result of the state adopting a tough line and holding back final clearances for allocating iron ore and other mines to private sector investors unless they displayed their commitment by making a minimum payment for the required land.        
	Gumla deputy commissioner Rahul Sharma told The Telegraph, ArcelorMittals proposal has been sent to the office of the divisional commissioner. We have identified about 1,200-acre government land which is barren. The plots are adjoining neighbouring Khunti district.                                                  
	While the payment for land is definitely a step forward for the project, it is no guarantee that ArcelorMittal would ultimately set up a plant here simply because global steel demand has slumped in the last six months due to the meltdown.        
	The World Steel Association has predicted 15 per cent fall in global steel demand, and only India was expected to register a growth. No wonder, ArcelorMittal cut back production by as much as 45 per cent.         
	Also, the company may post losses for the second consecutive quarter in Luxembourg tomorrow, forcing it to re-negotiate loan terms with bankers.        
	CEO Vijay Bhatnagar has always been cautious. Initially we were thinking of putting six MTPA steel plant in phase one. We may put up smaller plants we could cut the size to three MTPA (million tonne per annum) in each phase due to the slump in demand and other issues, including land acquisition problems in India, he had said in New Delhi on the sidelines of an industry meet.         
	Bhatnagar was referring to local opposition, spearheaded by the Adivasi Moolvasi Ashtitva Raksha Manch, to land being allotted to private industry, which has held up the project for over four years.         
	ArcelorMittal signed an MoU with Jharkhand in 2005, but so far, little headway has been made on the question of allotting land.         
	The company though has identified land to set up the steel unit and an office in Ranchi. It has already been allotted the Karampada (65 MT expected reserve) iron-ore reserves in West Singhbhum spread over 200 hectares and a coal block in Seregarha (83 MT expected reserve) in Latehar district.

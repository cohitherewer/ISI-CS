The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Climate meet clings to political hope

          G.S. MUDUR                       Police clash with protesters in Copenhagen   on Saturday. (AP)                          
	New Delhi, Dec. 12: The climate change conference in Copenhagen appeared poised today to slip into a new phase with ministers arriving for talks to resolve persisting differences before the heads of state arrive next week, delegates said.        
	Some of the most contentious issues such as greenhouse gas emissions cuts by the industrialised countries and financial help from them to the developing countries remain unresolved as the conference passed its midway mark.         
	Well have a new dynamic in our work -- the (arrival of ministers) may politically resolve some issues that at the technical level are difficult to resolve, a Brazilian delegate at the conference said this evening.         
	Indias environment minister Jairam Ramesh, who arrived here on Friday, has had consultations with several delegations, sources in Copenhagen told The Telegraph. Ramesh has met with the chief US negotiator Todd Stern, UKs secretary of state for energy and climate Ed Milliband, the Chinese and Danish ministers, and the minister from Algeria who represents the Africa group.        
	Negotiators at the talks, non-government observers and environmental groups said the industrialised countries had not yet demonstrated a willingness to take on deep emission reductions.        
	The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has said the developed countries should cut 25 to 40 per cent emissions from 1990 levels by 2020. But the European Union has offered only a 20 per cent cut.         
	Science tells us we need 30 per cent (emissions cuts) ... but the EU would like to put pressure on others to deliver more. We need more ambitious targets from the US and China, a senior EU conference delegate said.         
	At a 70-minute conference session this afternoon, delegations from developing countries reiterated their concerns at lack of progress on emission reductions commitments by the industrialised countries.         
	A delegate from Sudan speaking on behalf of G77 and China said the developing countries had great concern at the lack of will of the industrialised countries to constructively engage in the talks.        
	Theres a lack of will to commit to ambitious cuts, a G77 delegate said. The world is watching to see whether the Annex I (industrialised) countries are really prepared to match words with real actions, Chinas delegate told the session.        
	Delegates from Bolivia, Grenada, India, Nigeria, Saudi Arabia, South Africa, and Zambia joined the Sudanese delegate in expressing concern that attempts were currently being made to dismantle or replace the existing legal architecture for climate change enshrined in the Kyoto Protocol -- which imposes legally binding emissions cuts only on industrialised countries.        
	They (the industrialised countries) want to erase the climate debt they have accumulated, said the Bolivian delegate.        
	But European negotiators argued that any new legal instrument was not intended to kill the Kyoto Protocol but to introduce a more effective climate accord that would include the worlds two largest emitters -- China and the US -- both of which are currently outside the Kyoto Protocol.        
	The US never ratified the Kyoto Protocol, and China, a developing country, is exempted from legally binding emissions targets under the Kyoto Protocol.        
	The agreement [Kyoto Protocol] that we now have cannot achieve (climate change) objectives, a European official said.        
	Developing country delegates and environmental groups have also slammed the European Unions pledge of 2.4 billion Euros per year for the next three years to developing countries to help them deal with climate change.        
	There are two problems with this funding, said Tim Gore, climate change policy adviser with the non-government Oxfam. Climate change will last more than three years. Developing countries dont need short-term sticking plasters ... they need sustained long-term finance.         
	The other problem is -- this is funny money, Gore said in Copenhagen today. This appears to come from commitments made before that are being recycled as climate funds, he said. Aid should not be recycled ... the funds should be genuinely new, he said.         
	Sudans Lumumba Stanislaus Di-Aping, representing G77, has said he is unimpressed with the figure, the AFP news agency reported. Our view is that European leaders are acting as if they were climate sceptics, Di-Aping was quoted by the agency as saying.        
	Mexico on Friday joined the small group of developing countries -- including India, Brazil, and China -- offering unilateral action to limit its emission of greenhouse gases beginning in 2012.

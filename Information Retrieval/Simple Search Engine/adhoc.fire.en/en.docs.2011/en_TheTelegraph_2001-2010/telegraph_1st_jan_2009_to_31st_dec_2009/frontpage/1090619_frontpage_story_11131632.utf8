  - Legal experts cry foul as Speaker sits on verdict for ages          SUMAN K. SHRIVASTAVA                                                 
	Ranchi, June 18: As the 73-member Jharkhand Assembly, under suspended animation since the state was put under Presidents rule on January 21, gets ready to send two MPs to the Rajya Sabha, the election could come under a cloud since nine MLAs face disqualification under the anti-defection law, raising questions about their status in the House.        
	Speaker Alamgir Alam concluded hearings in the cases, some of which are four and a half years old, in January but is yet to deliver a judgement. In response to a PIL filed in Jharkhand High Court, he had even signed an affidavit to come out with a verdict as soon as possible in October.         
	But so far, there has been no word from his office.        
	Legal experts pointed out that legislators could vote in Saturdays Rajya Sabha election even if the House was under suspended animation, citing a Punjab and Haryana High Court verdict in 1987 when the Punjab Assembly was faced with a similar situation.         
	The election for filling a seat in the Rajya Sabha isnt a part of the legislative proceedings. Nor is a vote cast in such an election a vote given in the House, pointed out a senior Assembly official requesting anonymity.         
	But the scenario is different if MLAs were facing anti-defection cases. By allowing legislators facing disqualification to vote when the Speaker has reserved judgement against them was contrary to the concept of natural justice, pointed out former advocate-general Anil Sinha.                          
	He explained that the Speaker acts as a tribunal when he hears cases under the anti-defection law. Since a constitutional tribunal never ceases to exist, the Speaker cannot take any alibi of his inaction under the anti-defection law. I think he is sitting over the cases for political reasons, Sinha alleged.        
	 If the legislators have a right to vote, the Speaker too has a right to disqualify them, he maintained.        
	Former Speaker and MP Inder Singh Namdhari, who is also on the panel of chairpersons of the Lok Sabha, said Jharkhand had thrown up an unprecedented constitutional challenge.         
	When the Speaker concluded hearings five months back, there is no logic for him to sit over the verdict, thereby allowing the MLAs to vote in the Rajya Sabha elections, he said.        
	Under these circumstances, he said, the Rajya Sabha elections would become a farce. The Election Commission should have taken note of this. Now, if the Assembly is dissolved by June 22, all these petitions will become infructuous, Namdhari, the newly elected MP from Chatra, pointed out.         
	 Alam, when contacted, said he would take a decision on the disqualification cases at an appropriate time, refusing to come out with a timeframe even though he has been under fire from the Jharkhand High Court as well as the Opposition for sitting on the cases for so long.        
	Among the nine facing disqualification were four former ministers Stephen Marandi, Anosh Ekka, Kamlesh Singh and Bhanu Pratap Sahi.         
	Besides, three suspended BJP legislators_ Ravindra Rai, Kunti Singh and Manohar Tekriwal _ were also charged with violating provisions of the anti-defection law for going along with Babulal Marandis party when he left the BJP to form the Jharkhand Vikas Morcha in 2006.        
	Pradeep Yadav and Vishnu Bhaiya, who were also with them, have quit the Assembly.

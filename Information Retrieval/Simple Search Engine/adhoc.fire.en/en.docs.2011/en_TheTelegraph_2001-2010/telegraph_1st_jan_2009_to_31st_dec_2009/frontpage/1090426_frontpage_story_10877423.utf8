The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Modi snaps at Advani heels
                                                                                                           Modi snaps at Advani heels
          SANKARSHAN THAKUR                             Children wear masks of Modi and Advani in Surat on Saturday. (PTI)                                  
	Godhra, April 25: BJP frontrunner L.K. Advani hasnt assured himself yet that his final, and anxious, lunge will land him the prime ministership, but Narendra Modis succession act is already a work well in progress.         
	Should he secure the numbers after May 16, Advani has no cause to be concerned about immediate challenge because Modi is still endorsing his candidacy, as he did late this afternoon from the stained symbolisms of a Godhra stage, exhorting a modest temple-ground crowd to strengthen Advanijis hands to throw the Congress out of power.         
	But should his attempt at the summit falter, it is increasingly clear Modi and his outspoken backers in the party could move to hasten a change of guard.         
	Perhaps an explicit sign of the power-balance in the party being manipulated anew is the sudden outcrop of endorsements for Modis future premiership mid-campaign when Advani is not only in harness, he is also unanimously anointed spearhead.         
	And it isnt an anonymous clamour that could be ignored or put down as a command performance; it comes from high and respected quarters in the party. BJP ideologue Arun Shourie was unabashed about flagging Modi as future Prime Minister at a news conference in Ahmedabad; today it was the partys most authoritative spokesperson, Arun Jaitley.         
	BJP president Rajnath Singh might want to annotate the new welter of support for Modi  it also means, after all, that his own office-bearers see no future for him  but party circles in Gujarat are at once puzzled and thrilled about whats beginning to unfold.         
	A worker on the Advani campaign in Gandhinagar who is an outsider, thought it unsettling. Why should this be suddenly happening now? he asked. We are into a campaign that Advaniji is leading, where is the issue of naming someone for a job that is not even available?         
	But a senior office-bearer in the state BJP, which is a handpicked Modi court, said: This should have happened long ago. You cannot keep Modiji in the background because today he is the most accepted face of the Sangh-BJP ideology, he is the one man who can get cadres excited  not only in Gujarat but all across the country.         
	He denied there was any attempt on Modis part to pose a challenge to a senior and respected leader like Advaniji but maintained that the time has come for the projection of Modi at the national level in order to galvanise the party.         
	Without naming Advani, he said: We have sent out some confused signals to our loyal workers and followers. We have said some things about Hindutva and Ayodhya in our manifesto but we are underplaying them in our campaign. Modiji is the only leader who is speaking clearly and boldly. Abhi spasht bolne wale neta ki zaroorat hai party aur desh ko. (The party and the country need a leader who speaks clearly.)         
	Pressed if he meant that as a criticism of Advani, the leader said: Well, it is true that the core following of the BJP feels that too many compromises on ideology and programme are being made in the pursuit of prime ministership. You have to make compromises in a coalition, but that does not mean forgetting your core issues altogether.         
	And frankly, there is the issue of age. This is Advanijis last election, what is wrong in projecting a successor early anyhow?         
	Modi himself has left few in doubt where his gaze rests  Gujarat is already too small a field for him, his discourse is national rather than provincial. In rally after rally during this campaign, he has underlined his indifference to local competition from the Congress; his rhetoric is aimed straight at Sonia Gandhi and if he shifts targets he moves to Manmohan Singh or Rahul.         
	His speeches are not about Gujarat anymore; thats an old story from which hes extracted Gujarat away as a metaphor for the nation. This country is like this because the Congress has been ruling most of the time, he told his Godhra audience today. We have to root the Congress out from Kanyakumari to Kashmir, we have to give this country the golden hue of Gujarat, and tell me who can do that? He deftly left the answering to the crowd that roared Modi! Modi!!         
	Appropriation, personal and political, is an old Modi tactic. It has, among other things, seen him morph into an alchemy of Gujarati icons past and present: he is Sardar Patel Mark II as well as Morari Bapu, the most popular neo-Hindu evangelist in these parts; Modis signature cut-sleeve kurtas are a straight lift from Bapus wardrobe.         
	But in this campaign, Modis appropriations have taken a quantum leap and aggressed on Advani himself. To the nation, Advani is the face of the BJPs central slogan in these elections  Mazboot Neta, Nirnayak Sarkar (Strong Leader, Decisive Government).         
	Across Gujarat, though, that slogan is copyrighted to Modi  on posters and banners, in newspaper advertisements, in FM radio jingles, everywhere that slogan is attached to Modi  Mazboot Neta, Nirnayak Sarkar.         
	And this isnt even an election in which Modi is up for office; many are wondering what subtle message the Gujarat strongman might be wanting to convey to the country, the party and to the leader he regularly swears loyalty to.

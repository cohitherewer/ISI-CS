The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | 1000 vie for 15 VC vacancies
                                                                                                           1000 vie for 15 VC vacancies
  - Varsity race more daunting than IIT admission mission          CHARU SUDAN KASTURI                                     
	New Delhi, Feb. 2: Bagging a vice-chancellors post at 15 new promised central universities will prove tougher than securing a seat at the elite Indian Institutes of Technology.         
	The human resource development ministry has received over 1,000 applications for a maximum of 15 top jobs at the varsities, setting off a frantic race for posts once seen as honorary, The Telegraph has learnt.        
	Of the 15 central universities, three are existing institutions that will be upgraded. HRD ministry officials are likely to retain vice-chancellors currently holding office at these universities.         
	Even if the ministry were to appoint new VCs to all 15 universities, officials would have to sift through 67 applications to pick one aspirant.        
	The IIT Joint Entrance Examination, considered by many as the toughest test to crack in the country, selected around 7,500 students in 2008 from around 320,000 who took the exam. So, one out of every 43 IIT applicants was selected in last years entrance examination.         
	We received sackfuls of applications for the posts. Some were delivered personally. Many have recommendations from current or past VCs attached, a ministry source said.         
	The large number of applications was particularly surprising as aspirants were given a very brief two-week window to apply for the posts, ministry officials said.         
	The President on January 16 signed on an HRD ministry ordinance giving sanction to start the 15 new universities. The next day the ministry placed advertisements in national dailies seeking applications.         
	January 31 was the last date for submitting applications.         
	The applicants include faculty members across universities. But a few junior HRD ministry officials have themselves applied for the posts, it is learnt.         
	These VC posts were originally meant to be honorary positions to which the best people were nominated. It is a reflection of the state of our higher education that practically everyone thinks he or she is qualified for the post, a senior official said.         
	Revised pay for VCs has led to an increase in their basic salary band, which started from Rs 26,000 a month earlier, to Rs. 75,000 a month now. The new pay scales for higher education teachers were notified on December 31 to coincide with the New Year. But the new salaries - with arrears - have been made available from February.        
	India has 24 central universities at present, and the UPA has promised another 30 under the 11th five-year plan. Of the 30, the Prime Minister has said 14 will be world class universities.        
	The remaining 16 are meant for states that do not have central universities. Goa has, however, opted to stay without a central university.         
	Of the 15 central universities approved in the ordinance, 12 will be new. The state universities in Uttarakhand, Madhya Pradesh and Chattisgarh will be upgraded to central status.

	Can the Indian economy decouple from a world that is crumbling under the weight of the worst economic crisis in almost a century?        
	The optimists reckon it can  but the realists do not believe that the question even merits consideration. Global economies are more closely integrated today than ever before and a ripple in one corner of the world has a cascading effect on the rest.        
	So, it is with some trepidation that the mavens await the International Monetary Funds next set of spooky forecasts. Many feel that the IMF will lower its global growth outlook for 2009 for the third time in four months. Dominique Strauss-Kahn, the head of the IMF, has already said that the Fund plans to cut its 2.2 per cent growth forecast for the global economy in 2009.        
	In early November, the Fund predicted that the advanced economies would contract by 0.25 per cent this year, which would be the first negative result since World War II. Strauss-Kahn believes that the first shoots of a recovery arent likely to be seen before 2010.         
	The question that must weigh on the minds of Indian policy makers is to decide how to spend money wisely in the next three to four years so that the country is ready to grab the opportunities that will arise by 2012.        
	In 2008, the government frittered away much of its money on a populist farm loan waiver of over Rs 70,000 crore, a pay rise for civil servants and a sharp rise in oil subsidies. The result: the fiscal deficit that the government promised to cap at Rs 1,33,287 crore for the full year ended March 31, 2009, in its budget estimates has gone completely haywire.        
	In the nine months between April and November 2008, the fiscal deficit surged to Rs 1,76,510 crore  132.4 per cent of the target with another three months still to go! The fiscal deficit is being financed out of borrowings, which means future governments will have to bear the burden of todays profligacy.        
	What lies ahead        
	If the macro-economic numbers seem scary, the growth forecasts do not inspire a great deal of confidence. The economy is projected to grow at least 7 per cent this year, though there are Cassandras who predict it might be lower than 6 per cent.        
	Still, 7 per cent is good in a year of turmoil: the bad news is that will become worse in 2009-10. JPMorgan forecast that growth in the next fiscal might tumble to 5.8 per cent and it isnt the only one which is expecting the Indian juggernaut to shudder into low gear.        
	The 7 per cent growth in 2008-09 was predicated on strong manufacturing sector growth because the services industry  especially financial services  has been badly roiled by the economic turmoil. But here too the numbers do not inspire confidence.        
	With the slowdown spreading through large swathes of industry, companies have started to crimp costs, cut back on investments and even start a round of layoffs.        
	Exports have emerged as a major problem area: as trade flows start getting disrupted, Indias exports turned negative for the first time in five years in October when it slid 12 per cent to $12.82 billion in October 2007.         
	Other trends        
	The slowdown in India began with the slump in real estate prices and the sharp drop in construction activity. As the credit crunch exacerbated, industry started finding it harder to raise money. The trouble sectors now include retailing, automobiles, airlines, hotels and tourism. Demand for products has started to slow.        
	The focus has now turned on serious pump-priming measures to beat the crisis. The government has had to take the lead with the focus on investment in public-private projects and creating new infrastructure.         
	Some years ago, there was a string of forecasts that said India would emerge as the third or the fourth largest economy by 2025. The current turmoil has seriously undermined the boom-boom numbers but the basic premise may still hold  and India could break into the big league of nations in the next two decades.

	I hope...  
	It is my impression that banks will start lending at a more reasonable  interest rate by the
  middle of this year and demand will pick up from the fourth quarter   
	Rahul Bajaj,
  Chairman, Bajaj Auto    
	The most efficient  companies will emerge stronger. India is fortunate to be a reasonably
  cost-efficient economy with exports constituting only a small part of its GDP. With proper policy measures, it can continue to grow based on  domestic demand  
	A.M. Naik,
  CMD, Larsen amp; Toubro    
	Due to the current  economic crisis, we will see a slower GDP growth in fiscal 2009-10. Despite this, in the next fiscal, India should be the fastest growing economy,   surpassing China  
	Adi B. Godrej,
  Chairman, Godrej Group    
	India should take  advantage of the current economic crisis and speed up its infrastructure  projects. It will help  mitigate the impact  of the crisis  
	R.C. Bhargava,
  Chairman, Maruti Suzuki India    
	If we utilise the current  opportunity by taking the right measures, India can expect to take a decisive role as a regional power in the next decade  
	R. Seshasayee,
  Managing director, Ashok Leyland    
	By 2016, the Indian automotive industry rsquo;s output is estimated to be close to $150 billion. By that time, the industry will sustain over 35 million jobs  
	Ravi Kant,
  Managing director, Tata Motors    
	The global downturn throws up many opportunities and India can use this period to build its  infrastructure at low cost

  - Maoists are at Kathmandu gates again          SANKARSHAN THAKUR                                                    
	Kathmandu, Dec. 6: Nepals anniversary of resolutions has descended into a portentous clamour of conflict. This was the momentous hour, three years ago, of the end of civil war and the inking of peace between the Maoists and establishment parties.        
	But today sounded like another eve of calamitous convulsions  protest and arson crackling on shuttered streets, the panicked scurry of securitymen and sirens across town, confrontation pirouetting at a dozen flashpoints across the land that has left six dead and dozens injured over the weekend, the spectre of a rollback of hope hovering low overhead.        
	Today was a day of Maoist bandh, provoked by violent clashes over seizure of land in the far west district of Kailali. But today was not about a stray provincial incident and today was not the last of such closures  theres one planned for later this week, and a three-day freeze later in December.        
	Squared out of the power equation and frustrated that they have no role in running the nation despite securing its mandate in last years elections, the Maoists are beginning to grind Nepal to a halt once again.        
	The chief political players are in a daily tug-of-war to tear consensus. The Constituent Assembly lies deadlocked and disabled. The peace accord is a fiction in flames. The government of Prime Minister Madhav Nepal is not merely unable to contain the slide, it remains remarkably indifferent.        
	This happens, said one of his spokesmen dismissively of the many fires beginning to erupt, these disruptions are only proof of the Maoists desperation, these are unlawful tactics, they will be defeated, nothing that can worry us.        
	The Maoists are returning the compliment louder each day, labelling the government an illicit arrangement that has subverted the peoples will and demonstrating each passing day their mounting sway on the street. Party apparatchiks, vanguarded by the Young Communist League (YCL), the Maoist striking arm, had the run of Kathmandu all day, motioning riot police to the roadsides with their red flags, squeezing all traffic and trade, beating and burning where they had to, unspooling a worrisome trailer of whats to come.         
	No option but to do this, a burly YCL member patiently explained as his cadres brought down two motorcyclists cutting through Durbar Marg, the capitals central vista. We are being robbed of our rightful role, the people are being denied their will, we cannot sit in the barracks and watch, the country must be brought back on course, the revolution cannot be allowed to die.        
	This must be the most slippery revolution on earth, so many times has it come on waves of chaos and of merriment, so many times has it been hailed as victory, so many times, now, it has collapsed on its aspirations. It first erupted four years ago, as if by the throw of a long-smothered switch  an explosion of hundreds of thousands on the streets of the streets of Kathmandu that pushed a devious usurper King into restoring parliament and recognising the people rather than his palace as supreme. The Peoples Revolution, they called it.         
	It has still to come to bear for the people who made it. Even though Gyanendra has been bundled out of Narainhity Palace and Nepal has morphed from Kingdom to Republic, even though the civil war is officially over and peace formally signed, even though feisty elections have been held and Maoists handed the largest measure of confidence, even though theyve had a stint in power.        
	Its astonishing what we are witnessing, says Hari Roka, independent member of Nepals defunct Constituent Assembly, The Maoists powered Nepals huge transition, they changed the nomenclature of the state, got into the royal palace and drove out an unpopular King, but having got there, they were driven out as well. It was as it they could go thus far and no further, they were robbed of what the people had given them, there will be consequences. The Maoists represent an aspiration that probably lies outside Kathmandu, in the countryside, but that is still a Nepali aspiration, the more you blockade the Maoists, the stronger they will become. And what you are seeing is probably the beginning of those consequences, another period of anarchy in pursuit of the historic watershed that eludes the nation.        
	Rokas dire prophecy is probably already in play, its peppered all over the news from Nepal  the rampant confiscation of land and harvest by the landless, the sporadic clashes between those that have and those that dont and the smashing of feudal shackles, the steady defection of grassroots political workers from the Nepali Congress and the ruling United Marxist-Leninists to the ranks of the Maoists, the inability of the bystander state to block any of that.        
	It is as if change has gathered its own impetus in the Nepali heartland and is proceeding independent of the political deadlock in Kathmandu.        
	But make no mistake about it, the Maoists are banging the gates of Kathmandu again to barge in and claim what they believe is theirs.        
	And for all the sanguine sounds Prime Minister Madhav Nepals office is making, the reigning ring over Kathmandus sullen wintry dusk was the panicked whirr of sirens.

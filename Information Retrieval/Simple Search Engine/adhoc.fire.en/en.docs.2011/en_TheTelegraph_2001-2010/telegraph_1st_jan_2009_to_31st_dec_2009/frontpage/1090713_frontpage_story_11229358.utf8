          AMIT ROY                            Hardeep Kohli (right)                                   
	London, July 12: Hardeep Singh Kohli, a 39-year-old Sikh presenter on the BBC, has been suspended from working on a television programme for six months after he admitted he had overstepped the mark with a female researcher.        
	Kohli, who was born in Scotland and has been heavily promoted by the BBC as part of its general strategy of correcting a corporation once labelled hideously white  the words of its former director-general Greg Dyke  was accused of misbehaving by a woman colleague two months ago on a light current affairs TV programme called The One Show.        
	Kohli has tried, possibly a little too hard, to build himself up to a celebrity by wearing a range of colourful turbans and being a little too free with four-letter words. His sense of humour can best be described as an acquired taste.        
	Under a headline One Shows Hardeep Singh Kohli pestered researcher, the Mirror newspaper reported: One Show star Hardeep Singh Kohli has been suspended by the BBC after being accused of sexually pestering a female researcher.        
	In a statement, Kohli himself confessed the complaint was not without foundation.        
	Nobody has accused me of sexual harassment, he said but also admitted: I recognise I overstepped the mark and have apologised unreservedly.        
	The BBC today would not reveal the identity of the woman who had lodged the informal complaint or the nature of the offence by Kohli.        
	Kohli has a 16-year-old daughter and a 11-year-old son but split from his wife Sharmila two years ago.        
	In fact, the BBC went out of its way to protect Kohli as much as it could, claiming words like sex pest and sexual harassment were disproportionate and that Kohli was not banned from working on other BBC programmes.        
	The BBC said in a formal statement: Producers of The One Show received a complaint regarding Hardeeps behaviour towards a production colleague.         
	She made no formal complaint and has acknowledged that One Show management took the issue extremely seriously. He was reprimanded and immediately apologised.         
	He agreed to take some time away from the show to reflect on his behaviour. This leave of absence has been agreed to be six months.        
	The Kohli affair is the latest scandal to hit The One Show. In February, Carol Thatcher, daughter of former Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, was fired after referring to a tennis player as a Golliwog off-air.        
	At one level, Kohlis misdemeanour must be twice as bad as that of high-profile presenter Jonathan Ross who was suspended for three months.        
	He and another presenter, Russell Brand, had telephoned an actor, Andrew Sachs, on air and left him a lewd telephone message. In it, Brand had boasted he had slept with Sachss 23-year-old granddaughter Georgina Baillie.        
	Ross has since returned to his post but Brand has not worked for the BBC, though he continues to flourish on other channels.

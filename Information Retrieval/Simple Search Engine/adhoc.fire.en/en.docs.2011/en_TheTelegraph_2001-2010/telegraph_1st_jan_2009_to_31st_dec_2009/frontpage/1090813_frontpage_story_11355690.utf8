          SATISH NANDGAONKAR                      Kasab at Chhatrapati Shivaji Terminus during the attack                          
	Mumbai, Aug. 12: An official of the US Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) today reinforced Indias claim of the Pakistan connection in 26/11 by confirming that the Global Positioning System devices used by the attackers clearly showed they had travelled from Karachi.        
	Testifying before Judge M.L. Tahalyani, an FBI forensic expert, whose identity has been kept secret on court orders, said he had examined three of the five GPS devices and a satellite phone used by the gunmen and recovered by Mumbai police.         
	The way points or the routes noted on the maps showed that the attackers had travelled from the Gulf of Karachi to Mumbai, the FBI official, clad in a light green blazer, said.        
	The official, who has been working with the bureau since 1992 as an electronics technician and a forensic examiner, said he used FBI software to download the memory from the GPS sets. The software retrieves data through the longitudinal and latitudinal locations saved on the device.         
	The officer, one of six FBI experts present in court, submitted 29 maps, which included those of Mumbai and the targeted sites: the Colaba area, the Taj and Oberoi-Trident hotels, Nariman House and Chhatrapati Shivaji Terminus. Also, there were maps of Karachi and Rawalpindi.        
	The way points (charted on the GPS device) reflect points from Gulf of Karachi to Mumbai, the officer said.         
	The attackers, he said, had used code words for the routes. Jala1 was used for the starting point of Gulf of Karachi and Jala4 for Mumbai. Two other intermediate points were named Jala2 and Jala 3.         
	The FBI expert explained the GPS devices charted the return route automatically. The track background is saved by the GPS automatically. The way points tracked the route from Mumbai, named OcenA, and ended at Karachi, named Ocen1, he said. One device showed they had an alternative route from Mumbai to Rawalpindi.         
	The expert said he could not retrieve data from two of the five GPS devices since they used old software which made them useless once their batteries drained out.         
	The Mumbai police had dispatched the devices in sealed covers to the FBI, and he had examined them from February 11-18. Soft and hard copies of the data report were sent to the Mumbai police, he said.        
	Pakistani gunman Ajmal Kasab smiled through the proceedings.         
	Kasabs co-accused Sabahuddin Ahmed, charged with providing maps of the four targeted sites, was allowed to pose a question. Ahmed asked if the officer could name the points plotted on the route on the GPS devices.         
	The FBI expert said he did not possess geographical knowledge of the places marked, and hence could not name any.        
	The prosecution will examine three American witnesses through video conferencing tomorrow. They are representatives from Internet telephony provider Callphonex, Nokia and Yamaha.

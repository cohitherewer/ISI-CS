The party decided to field Mahto, a former senior BJP leader, in Jamshedpur, where he would face former chief minister Arjun Munda. Ajsu has also given tickets to former minister Chandra Prakash Choudhary in Hazaribagh and Deo Sharan Bhagat in Lohardaga. Picture by Manik Bose                                        
	Ranchi, March 20: The BJP today offered the Chatra Lok Sabha constituency to JD(U) to keep alive its pre-poll alliance in order, burying the prospect of Inder Singh Namdhari contesting from the seat.        
	The decision would give a fillip to JD(U), which would get another seat, Palamau, reserved for Scheduled Caste candidates.        
	BJP spokesman Prakash Javadekar said at a news conference in New Delhi today that the JD(U) would contest two seats in Jharkhand, signifying the BJP would field candidates in 12 out of 14 seats, including Koderma, where the battle would be against its former vice-president Babulal Marandi.        
	Although there was no immediate reaction from state JD(U) as party chief Jaleshwar Mahto could not be contacted, but a senior JD(U) MLA, requesting anonymity, said that the formula should be acceptable to them.        
	Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar is said to have told the state unit leaders yesterday that the party should claim two seats only, as they had no sitting MPs in Jharkhand.        
	The BJPs announcement, however, has apparently shattered the hope of former Assembly Speaker and Independent MLA from Daltonganj Inder Singh Namdhari, who was keen to contest from Chatra with the NDAs support.        
	The BJP, earlier ready to offer Palamau to its junior partner, was trying hard to extend support to Namdhari, who wanted to fight as an Independent. Namdhari, who enjoys huge support at the grassroots level, had quit JD(U) in 2007.        
	On the other hand, JD(U) wanted Namdhari, an Independent MLA from Daltonganj, to join the party and then claim the ticket.        
	The BJP high commands decision also rattled its state chief Raghubar Das, who had assured Namdhari of extending their support to him at Chatra. He rushed to Delhi on a damage control mission in the evening, claiming to have received no official communiqu in this regard.        
	In fact, JD(U) did not declare its nominees from Jharkhand today as promised by Nitish yesterday.        
	In the UPA, there was confusion too with the RJD-LJP not choosing to unveil its plan for Jharkhand after the Congress sealed a seven-five deal with the JMM Both Lalu Prasad and Ram Vilas Paswan were busy to settle the political storm in Bihar. state RJD leaders, who flew to Delhi today, were asked by Lalu Prasad to wait and watch.        
	The RJD was also in touch with Independent MLAs, including Madhu Koda, Stephen Marandi and Bandhu Tirkey, who have thrown their hat in the poll ring. RJD legislature party leader Annapurna Devi said that t nothing was clear as yet. The talks are on, she added.        
	The voice of dissent to the deal struck between the Congress and JMM came from the eldest son of Shibu Soren, Durga, who declared that the JMM would contest all the 14 seats in Jharkhand.         
	The final seat-sharing formula will be worked when Shibu Soren is fit, he said only to be rebuffed by JMM MLA Champai Soren that the party would not come out of the alliance.

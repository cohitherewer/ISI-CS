                                                                                                           Pay hike for junior doctors
          SUDHIR KUMAR MISHRA                            RIMS                                  
	Ranchi, Feb. 21: The governors advisory council today revised salaries of junior doctors at RIMS in Ranchi and MGMC in Jamshedpur, brining to an end a long-drawn, acrimonious stand-off between the medical fraternity and the state government.        
	Junior doctors will henceforth get a monthly salary of Rs 21,800 in the first year, Rs 22,579 in the second year and Rs 23,328 in the third year. Till now, doctors at Ranchis Rajendra Institute of Medical Sciences (RIMS) used to get Rs 17,560 per month in the first year, Rs 18,304 per month in the second year and Rs 18,846 per month in the third year.        
	At Jamshedpurs Mahatma Gandhi Medical College, doctors were getting Rs 9,200 per month in the first year, Rs 10,000 per month in the second year and Rs 10,800 per month in the third year.        
	The junior doctors have been fighting for this for long. On December 10 last year, junior doctors at RIMS proceeded on mass casual leave, and kept up the pressure by raising their demand for a wage revision at various forums.        
	On December 27, they launched an indefinite strike following an attack on a doctor on the RIMS premises. While holding talks with the government, they reiterated their demand for a revision of wages.        
	The strike was called off on January 1 after the health secretary assured them that their demands would be fulfilled within 15 days. However, doctors launched another indefinite strike on January 16 as the state government failed to keep its word.        
	The strike was again called off on January 21, after getting positive assurances from the Raj Bhavan.        
	And now that the governor has signed on the dotted line, doctors are relieved.         
	RIMS Junior Doctors Association spokesman Meghraj Kundan said: We are grateful to Governor Syed Sibtey Razi, health secretary Pradeep Kumar and IMA officials in particular, for their constant support. RIMS authorities also backed us.         
	Among the other decisions the advisory council took today were:        
	 256 new posts of officials for prisons in Ghaghidih, Khunti, Tenughat and Ghatshila were sanctioned that would cost the state Rs 2.25 crore annually        
	 For safety of schools, 230 chowkidars would be outsourced, but care would be taken to ensure the jobs were given to local people        
	 Funds were approved for strengthening and widening roads linking Chatra with Chouparan, Godda with Sunderpahari and Hazaribagh with Katkamsandi        
	 The Jharkhand Fiscal Responsiblity and Management Act would be amended through an ordinance        
	 The powers of deputy commissioners in land acquisition were revised        
	 Henceforth, the chief ministers approval would be necessary before announcing rewards above Rs 5 lakh for nabbing dreaded Naxalites

	New Delhi, Jan. 27: Prime Minister Manmohan Singh had toast and porridge for breakfast today and walked around in his room, showing steady progress after his bypass surgery on Saturday, doctors at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences said.         
	Everything is going fine. Physiotherapy and post-surgery rehabilitation is in progress. The Prime Minister walked in his room today, said a cardiologist who is a member of the medical team attending to the Prime Minister. Singh had breakfast with his wife and daughters this morning.         
	A medical bulletin issued this evening said Singh is being weaned off intensive care and would receive routine care from Wednesday.         
	The Prime Minister has now moved to a regular diet. He had a breakfast of toast and porridge, and a lunch of chappatis, vegetables and curds, said K.S. Reddy, a senior cardiologist who has been monitoring Singhs treatment.         
	Some invasive lines that had been used to monitor his heart and lung functions were removed on Monday.         
	The Prime Ministers daughter Daman Singh told a TV channel the family was trying to have its meals together. My mother is there throughout and we are three sisters so we take turns in being with her, she said.        
	Her fathers desire was just to get back home, she said. The family really appreciated that so many people had shown such concern for him, Daman added. Somebody had got him a CD of Ghalibs compositions, last night he was listening to that.

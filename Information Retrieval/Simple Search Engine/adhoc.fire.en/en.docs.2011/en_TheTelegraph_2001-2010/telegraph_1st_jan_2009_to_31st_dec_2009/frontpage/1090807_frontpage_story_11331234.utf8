  - Rooks can raise water level with stones          G.S. MUDUR                                                    
	New Delhi, Aug 6: Scientists have discovered that a bird from the crow family can learn to use stones to raise the water level in a jar in experiments that suggest one of Aesops fables might have stemmed from fact.         
	Two British researchers have provided the first evidence that a bird is capable of solving the problem described more than 2,000 years ago by the Greek slave Aesop through his fable, The Crow and the Pitcher.        
	Their experiments suggest that rooks  a species of intelligent birds from the crow family  can raise the water level in a jar using stones, learn the advantage of using large stones and use the exact number of stones needed.        
	The findings demonstrate a novel tool-using behaviour that has not been observed before in any other species except humans and orangutans.         
	This is remarkable considering their brains are so different from the brains of the great apes, said Christopher Bird, a researcher at Cambridge University and lead author of the study published today in the journal Current Biology.        
	Bird (the name is just a coincidence) and his colleague Nathan Emery at the Queen Mary University of London also observed that the rooks quickly learned that a larger stone led to a greater rise in water level and the reward  a floating worm -- could be had faster.        
	The rooks appear to be able to understand the problem and work out a solution, Bird told The Telegraph in an interview. Their use of stones suggests that they understand what the tool does.        
	The findings add new evidence of tool use in the crow family. Seven years ago, Oxford University researcher Alex Weir and his colleagues had reported the use of twigs and leaves as hooks by crows in the South Pacific islands of New Caledonia.         
	But water level manipulation was believed an exclusive human capability until two years ago when scientists at the Max Planck Institute of Evolutionary Anthropology in Leipzig, Germany, observed that orangutans can raise a floating peanut by spitting water into a tube to raise the level. It was the first scientific experiment to show an animal change the position of water to get food.         
	In the new study, the rooks used the exact number of stones needed. They stopped adding stones when the water level reached a point where they could dip their beaks into the jar to swallow the worm.         
	Bird said rooks have never been observed to use stones in this manner in the wild, possibly because they do not need to. The behaviour showed up only when the birds were challenged through the worm-in-jar experiments.        
	When the rooks encountered a problem, they found a solution, Bird said. The observations, he said, fit in with the moral of Aesops crow-and-pitcher fable -- necessity is the mother of invention.

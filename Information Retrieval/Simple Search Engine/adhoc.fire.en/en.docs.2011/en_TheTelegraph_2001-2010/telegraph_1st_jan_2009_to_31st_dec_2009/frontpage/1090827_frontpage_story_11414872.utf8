                                                                                                           Salman tests IPL waters
          SAMYABRATA RAY GOSWAMI                                              
	Mumbai, Aug. 26: If Salman Khan wants sweet revenge on Shah Rukh, all he needs to do is buy Sourav Ganguly should the Kolkata Knight Riders icon make himself available for bidding after the 2010 season.        
	The rivalry between the Bollywood stars now looks set to extend to cricket with Salman planning to bid for an Indian Premier League team. The actor is said to have the backing of a real estate group that was once a sponsor of Shah Rukhs Knight Riders.         
	Salman, who met IPL commissioner Lalit Modi over lunch today at Taj Lands End in Mumbai, was unavailable for comment.        
	But a source close to the actor said Salman gave Modi a Letter of Interest seeking more information about the possibility of buying a team.        
	He does not plan to buy out an existing team. He is interested in buying a new team  he has been talking to Lalit Modi informally for some time. Modi briefed him about all the IPL bylaws for owning a team, said the Salman aide.        
	Salman, the aide clarified, was yet to make up his mind. Bhai is checking out the waters. It is not as if he has signed on the dotted line, he is keen to find out everything before taking the plunge and that is what he did today, the Salman aide said.        
	That Salman was making more than just polite enquiries was confirmed by Modi. He was interested to know what it takes to own a team, whats the process, when it will be initiated and whats the timeline for it. I think he is a serious buyer, PTI quoted Modi as saying.         
	IPL expects to add two more teams to its existing tally of eight from the 2011 season, when the current players, including icons like Sourav, would be up for re-bidding. The franchise may cost over $200-300 million, said a source.        
	Salman, sources said, has expressed eagerness about Nagpur and Kochi, which are on the list of probables. The cities making the cut would need to meet IPL criteria, which, besides infrastructure, also look at returns on investment.        
	The sources said four to five investors could be backing Salman  among them Sunny Dewan (aka Wadhawan), one of the promoters of HDIL, a listed real estate company.        
	HDIL was a sponsor of the Knight Riders in the IPLs inaugural edition, but had backed out in Season 2.        
	Sunny and his socialite wife Anu are old friends of Salman, said a regular on Mumbais celebrity circuit.        
	Sources close to Salman said the star was also in talks with friends Sanjay Dutt and Ajay Devgan to form a consortium for owning an IPL team. A spokesperson for Sanjay, however, denied any such plans. There is nothing like that now, he said.

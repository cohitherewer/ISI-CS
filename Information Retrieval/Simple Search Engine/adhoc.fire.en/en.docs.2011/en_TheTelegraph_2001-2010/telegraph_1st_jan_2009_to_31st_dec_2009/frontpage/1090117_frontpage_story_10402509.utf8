	Ranchi, Jan. 16: Amid continuing political uncertainty in Jharkhand, Governor Syed Sibtey Razi is learnt to have sent a report today to the Centre saying there appeared to be little chance of ensuring an alternative government in the state.        
	Over the last week, both Delhi and Ranchi have been witness to futile attempts at trying and work out an alternative arrangement in Jharkhand. With uncertainty mounting, Razi seems to laid bare the exact political scenario in the state.        
	Throwing the ball at the Centres court, Razi is understood to have detailed the events of the last few days with chief minister Shibu Soren confined to his hospital bed and various party formations meeting him with their own views on the crisis.        
	While the Opposition BJP has openly demanded the imposition of Presidents rule  it has decided to launch a state-wide campaign from Monday  UPA members have dithered on the question of forming an alternative government, given that Sorens choice of successor, Seraikela JMM MLA Champai Soren, wasnt acceptable to all alliance members.        
	Today, the governor is said to have sent in his report, which paints a gloomy picture in so far as forming an alternative government was concerned. Governor has sent a detailed report to the Centre explaining the current chaotic scenario in the state, said a Raj Bhavan spokesman, but refused to comment on what his final recommendations were.        
	In his report, the governor has explained everything. The rest is for you people to guess, the spokesman added.        
	Late tonight, Sorens emissary to Delhi, JMMs Rajmahal MP Hemlal Murmu claimed he had met Congress president Sonia Gandhis political secretary Ahmed Patel in Delhi.         
	The Congress, he said over telephone after the meeting, was now in favour of forming a JMM-led alternative government in the state. The new chief minister too will be a JMM legislator, Murmu claimed, in what seemed to be a last ditch effort at saving the state from central rule.        
	With Soren in hospital and RJD chief Lalu Prasad not likely to return from Japan before Sunday, most leaders in the state were speculating that the impasse would continue for a few more days.        
	However, with Soren refusing to go to Delhi to thrash out a solution and Congress chief Sonia Gandhi not meeting a group of state UPA leaders, Congressmen who returned from the capital today admitted that central rule seemed to be the only way out.        
	Former deputy chief minister and Independent Stephen Marandi, state Congress chief Pradip Kumar Balmuchu, Congress legislature party leader Manoj Yadav and party whip in the Assembly Niel Tirkey were left discussing alternatives with senior leaders like Ahmed Patel, Ajay Maken and Prem Chand Gupta.         
	All of them returned to Ranchi apparently with the brief that they somehow persuade Soren come for talks to Delhi. Accordingly, Balmuchu and Tirkey drove to Apollo Hospital to meet him.         
	Soren has expressed his inability (to go to Delhi) on health grounds. Even though Delhi his giving him adequate opportunities, he is not willing to listen. Presidents rule might become the ultimate choice if the things continue like this, commented Tirkey after meeting Soren in hospital. Balmuchu too expressed similar views.        
	Stephen, whose resignation on the same day prompted Soren not delay any further, is publicly demanding fresh elections. I had gone to Delhi to tell senior UPA leaders that something ought to be done at the earliest. The political impasse has hit development work badly, he said, blaming Soren for not finding a solution to the present deadlock.        
	Earlier in the day, the BJP staged a dharna before Raj Bhavan demanding imposition of Presidents rule and submitted a memorandum to the governor. The partys Jharkhand affairs in-charge, Karuna Shukla, said the BJP would not tolerate any more political experiments in the state.         
	The BJP leader said the party would stage demonstrations at district headquarters on January 19. Thereafter, the agitation programme will be extended to block and panchayat levels.         
	Apollo Hospital maintained that Sorens condition was stable and he was feeling better. However, his test reports were yet to arrive.

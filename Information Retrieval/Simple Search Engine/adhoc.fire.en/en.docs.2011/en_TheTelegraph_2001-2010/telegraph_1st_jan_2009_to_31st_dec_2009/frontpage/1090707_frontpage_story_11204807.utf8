The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Govt borrowing to put strain on rates
                                                                                                               Govt borrowing to put strain on rates
          VIVEK NAIR                              
	Mumbai, July 6: Borrowers of home and other loans, who have seen interest rates coming down over the past few months, are unlikely to see the trend continuing. The huge government-borrowing programme this year to bridge the fiscal deficit is widely expected to put upward pressure on interest rates.        
	The Union budget 2009-10 has pegged the government borrowing at around Rs 4.5 trillion this year. This is higher than the market estimate,        
	which had estimated the gross borrowing to be in the region of Rs 4,00,000 crore. The revised borrowing figure is also a 25 per cent increase over the interim budget estimate of Rs 3.62 trillion made in February.        
	This has arisen because of high fiscal deficit of 6.8 per cent projected for this year. The government resorts to market borrowing to bridge the fiscal deficit.        
	Banking circles aver that the higher-than-expected borrowing programme will put pressure on gilt yields and this in turn could impact interest rates. A large government borrowing increases the supply of government paper, thereby sending their prices down. As yields are inversely related to price of bonds, any dip in bond prices, pushes up the yield.         
	The government yields are used to benchmark many loans. Therefore, any rise in yields will put upward pressure on interest rates. It will become increasingly difficult for the credit market rates, both deposit and lending, to come down, Rupa Rege Nitsure, chief economist at Bank of Baroda told The Telegraph.        
	Impact of the higher than expected government borrowing was felt in the bond markets today when yields on the benchmark 10 year security breached the 7 per cent mark to end at 7.03 per cent, higher than the 6.83 per cent on Friday.        
	It may be recalled that since October last year, the Reserve Bank of India has consistently brought down key rates to push the countrys growth rate. It has slashed the repo rate by 425 basis points        
	and reverse repo by 275 basis points.        
	The repo is the rate at which the RBI provides funds to banks against government securities they hold and reverse repo is that at which it absorbs liquidity. Though banks, have reduced interest rates, private sector banks have pointed out that the high government borrowing has stopped them from trimming the lending rates. However, recently various public sector banks brought down their lending rates by 25-50 basis points.        
	The gross borrowing target now reaches Rs 4.5 trillion. This will definitely have adverse implication on interest rates. Our view on the        
	10-year yield is that it will be at 7 per cent plus consistently for most part of the second half of this year and by end-march 2010 it could be 7.5 per cent, said Nischal Maheshwari, head research, Edelweiss Securities.        
	According to B. Prasanna, managing director and CEO of ICICI Securities, there is a possibility that that all the extra borrowing would be front ended and completed in the remaining three months of the first half when the liquidity is good. This increased borrowing may exert upward pressure in yields on a week-on-week basis.         
	Its not the prospects of pressure building on interest rates which are the sole reason for worry. Analysts also do not rule out the possibility of a sovereign rating downgrade by international credit rating agencies, if the government is unable to make progress on the fiscal front and take other actions to shore up revenues.         
	Moreover, yet another fear is that the higher government borrowing programme has the potential of liquidity not finding its way to fund the corporate sectors investment programme.

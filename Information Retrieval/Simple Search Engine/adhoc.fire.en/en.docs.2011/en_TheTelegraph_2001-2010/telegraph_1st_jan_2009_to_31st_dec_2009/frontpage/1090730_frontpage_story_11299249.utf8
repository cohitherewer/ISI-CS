The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Delhi boy killed after ransom
                                                                                                           Delhi boy killed after ransom
          ANANYA SENGUPTA                      Ribhu                          
	New Delhi, July 29: Kidnappers killed a 16-year-old student of a Delhi school after they apparently got wind of a police trap and fled with a part of a Rs 60-lakh ransom.        
	The body of Ribhu Chawla, a rope tied to the neck and legs soaked in blood, was found around 8am on a street in Vikaspuri in northwest Delhi.        
	The motorbike-borne Ribhu was waylaid and bundled into a car yesterday when he was on his way back from K.R. Mangalam World School in Vikaspuri.         
	Police said Ribhus father, businessman Sanjay Chawla, received the first ransom call  made from the boys mobile  just 30 minutes after eyewitnesses saw the boy being kidnapped and informed the cops. The spot from where he was kidnapped is only 200 metres from his home.        
	The kidnappers had demanded Rs 60 lakh and told Chawla to deliver the money in Rohini, a 30-minute drive from their home.         
	Sources said Rs 15 lakh was paid to the kidnappers around 12.40am today following another ransom call, traced to Sonepat in neighbouring Haryana, late last night. The rest of the sum was to be paid after release, the sources said.        
	A police posse was waiting near Rohini, where the first tranche of the ransom was being paid. Family sources said the kidnappers could have spotted the policemen, although they were in plainclothes.        
	The kidnappers fled with the money.         
	However, police sources refused to confirm the familys version on the kidnappers spotting the sleuths. Ribhus murder despite the part-ransom payment has led the police to suspect the boy knew the kidnappers.        
	It seems Ribhu knew the people who kidnapped him. The chances are that someone close to the family was involved someone who knew his routine and the familys financial condition, said a police officer.        
	A friend, identified only as Shwetank, claimed he had seen Ribhu being dragged into the car, but wasnt close enough to see the kidnappers faces clearly. We couldnt get any description from the friend as he was far away, said the police officer.        
	Shwetank told the police he first saw Ribhus bike being hit by the car. When Ribhu stopped to inspect the damage, the men came out of the car and dragged him in. Shwetank also said he saw the men point a gun at his friend.        
	Employees of Chawlas software business are being questioned, as are the familys servants.         
	But the police are being blamed for acting late. Questions are being raised about the FIR, lodged at 5pm, over two hours after eyewitnesses intimated the police about the 2.30pm abduction.         
	Delhi has seen a spate of kidnappings for ransom, some of them leading to murder, by friends and insiders from rich families. A week ago, the businessman son of a retired defence official was kidnapped by his friends for Rs 3 crore.

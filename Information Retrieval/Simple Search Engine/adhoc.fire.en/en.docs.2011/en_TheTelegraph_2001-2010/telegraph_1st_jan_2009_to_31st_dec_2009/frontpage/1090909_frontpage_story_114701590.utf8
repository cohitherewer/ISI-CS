The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Jet chief calls for sympathetic solution
                                                                                                           Jet chief calls for sympathetic solution
                                
	New Delhi, Sep 9 (PTI): Jet Airways Chairman Naresh Goyal said he would have no option but to follow ldquo;the law of the land rdquo; if an action had to be taken against the agitating pilots, while appealing to them to resolve the matter amicably and return to work.  
	 rdquo;(If) they don't follow company rules and procedures, I don't think we are left with any option and will follow whatever the law of the land is, rdquo; Goyal told CNBC TV18.
  He asked the striking pilots to follow the Bombay High Court order and cautioned them against the contempt of court.  
	 The agitation by Jet Airways pilots to protest the sacking of two of their colleagues entered the second day today with the private carrier cancelling over 100 domestic and international flights across the country, leaving passengers stranded.  
	 On whether he would close operations, Goyal said, ldquo;I will not allow to be held hostage. Whatever has to be done, we will do it. I hope it doesn't happen.. There are 30,000 employees involved... it is the question their livelihood... rdquo;,
  He added, ldquo;I hope things go back to normal... that's my only request to people who are misleading... and go back to normal operations. rdquo;  
	 Goyal said he has ldquo;no difficulty meeting rdquo; the pilots to resolve the matter amicably as it will be good for the company, the future of these employees and the reputation of the country.   
	Goyal said the pilots were rostered for duty on Monday after they assured they would not agitate and they agreed to meet the management on Thursday. However, the pilots went on mass sick leave as they knew passengers would be stranded at both domestic and international airports.  
	 The pilots of the airline have been reporting sick en- masse since yesterday. They had warned the management of the agitation from September 7.  
	 The pilots decided to go on mass sick leave from September 7 as the Regional Labour Commissioner is conducting conciliatory proceedings between the pilots and the management of the airline and any strike before the proceedings get over was declared illegal.

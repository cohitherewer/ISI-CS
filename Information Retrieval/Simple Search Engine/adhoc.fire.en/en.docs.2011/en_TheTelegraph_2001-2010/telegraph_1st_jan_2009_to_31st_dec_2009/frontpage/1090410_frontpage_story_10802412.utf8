The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Lofty heights to thorny tip, not a sashay for Shashi
                                                                                                           Lofty heights to thorny tip, not a sashay for Shashi
          MANINI CHATTERJEE                               Then amp; Now: Shashi Tharoor				                                 
	Thiruvananthapuram, April 9: In the only election he won in his life, the catchy campaign slogan  capturing all the cocky confidence of a talented and ambitious young man  went: Shashi Tharoor, jeetega zaroor.        
	Three and a half decades after that 1974 victory, Shashi Tharoor still exudes a boyish charm that has college girls swooning, and boasts a CV more impressive than any of the 542 other candidates in this summers election fray  author at age 10, a PhD at 22, ace debater, actor (he played Antony to Mira Nairs Cleopatra as an undergraduate), illustrious career in international diplomacy to become UN undersecretary-general, a brave if futile bid to rid the prefix under from his title, nine bestsellers to his name and a shoe-in to the Union cabinet were he and his party to win.        
	Yet, as he traverses through the hilly terrain of this picturesque town by the Arabian Sea  waving and addressing knots of townsfolk and villagers in a day that begins at 7am and ends close to midnight  the cockiness of yore is entirely missing. Not without reason.        
	The capital of Indias most literate and politically conscious state, after all, is not an extension of St. Stephens College (where he became the students union president on the strength of that slogan).  
	Compared to the complexity of caste and communal and intra-party politics, the machinations of international diplomacy, Tharoor is beginning to realise, were a babalogs picnic.        
	With just a week to go before polling day on April 16, therefore, the new slogan  if it were to be coined  is a more modest Shashi Tharoor, likely to scrape through.         
	This might seem odd since Kerala is one of the few states in the country where the Congress is expected to do very well, taking advantage of the perceived disenchantment with the CPM-led Left Democratic Front which swept the polls in 2004. Moreover, Thiruvananthapuram itself has never been a CPM bastion. This time, too, it is being fought by a relatively weak CPI candidate, P. Ramachandran Nair, and the Tharoor camp is hoping that the highly motivated CPM cadres will focus their attention on the neighbouring Attingal seat where sitting Marxist MP A. Sambath is on a strong wicket.        
	The reasons for Tharoors difficulty  apart from being an outsider with a pro-Israel, pro-imperialist tag  are grounded in the unusual political contours that have shaped this particular election in this southernmost tip of the erstwhile Travancore state.        
	Unlike the rest of Kerala which is strictly bipolar  political preferences neatly carved out between the LDF and the UDF  Thiruvananthapuram has begun to resemble Uttar Pradesh. Five national parties (the Congress, CPI, BJP, BSP and the NCP) and though the NCP does not amount to much, there is a serious four-way contest.        
	The BJP, which has never won even an Assembly seat in Kerala, has always had a strong base in northern Kasargod and here in Thiruvananthapuram. In 2004, BJP candidate . Rajagopal got 2.28 lakh votes, just 3,000 votes less than the Congress.         
	This time round, the BJPs state president, P. Krishna Das, is contesting the seat. If he polls anywhere near his predecessor, Tharoor could be in trouble. But Rajagopal was a popular figure.         
	Tharoors supporters are hoping that a bulk of that 2.28 lakh anti-Left vote comes the Congress way this time since Krishna Das doesnt enjoy his predecessors stature.         
	Of greater concern right now is the clout wielded by BSP candidate Neelalohithadasan Nadar (Neelan), a formidable leader who started out as a young Congress MP in 1978, switched many parties, was a minister in the LDF government under E.K. Nayanar, and was forced to quit after getting embroiled in two sexual harassment cases involving senior women officers.         
	Despite that stain on his reputation, Neelan has the support of the powerful Nadar community which accounts for some 15 per cent of the seats electorate. The Nadars, many of whom have converted to Christianity over the years, are resentful that the Congress no longer patronises them as it once used to and want to express their resentment by voting for the BSP candidate, a Congress member admitted.        
	In addition to the Nadar vote, he is also likely to draw the Dalit votes to some degree. Political activist C.P. John (who left the CPM along with M.V. Raghavan to form the Communist Marxist Party which is now a constituent of the UDF) said: Among Dalits in the southern Travancore region, there is a big shift towards Christianity socially and BSP politically, and though it is yet to reach a critical mass necessary for victory, Neelan could be a beneficiary.        
	To counter that, Tharoor has sought the help of the Church of South India which has influence among both Nadars and Dalit Christians but that may not stop the BSP from polling a respectable vote.        
	If the presence of the BSP and the BJP threatens to draw away a chunk of the anti-LDF vote, the absence of an active Congress machinery is adding to Tharoors woes. Unlike AICC secretary Tom Vaddakan who was forced to give up any ideas of contesting Thrissur in the face of a local revolt, the Congress here has grudgingly accepted Tharoors candidature because the high command fully backed him.        
	But Congress workers are not exactly working overtime for Tharoor. Nor are they trying to counter the Muslim clergys campaign against Tharoors alleged pro-imperialist tilt, leaving it to the candidate to point out that he did not win the UN secretary-general race because of the US veto.        
	The indefatigable energy that has fuelled Tharoors ambitions all his life shows no signs of flagging. He is banking on first-time voters and non-traditional voters to elect him to be their voice in Parliament.        
	As he weaves his way in and out of temples and Christian shrines, discusses the magic of democracy with young boys at a Muslim orphanage, and addresses countless street-corner meetings in a simple Malayalam that evokes more smiles than jeers, we ask him why he has chosen such a tough route to New Delhi. His answer: After a lifetime in international diplomacy, I wanted to earn the right to be in national politics.        
	At a time when the top brass of all political parties prefer the safe environs of the Rajya Sabha, there is a message in that whether Tharoor scrapes through or wins by a comfortable margin.

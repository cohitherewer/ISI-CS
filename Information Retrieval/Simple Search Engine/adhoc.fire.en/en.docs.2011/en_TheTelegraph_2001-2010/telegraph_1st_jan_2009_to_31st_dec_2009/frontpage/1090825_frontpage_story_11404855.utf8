                                                                                                           Shillong nod to mining basics
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                               
	Shillong, Aug. 24: The Meghalaya cabinet today approved undertaking pre-development activities at the mining sites by the Uranium Corporation of India Limited at a cost of Rs 209 crore.         
	Briefing reporters after the cabinet meeting, chief minister D.D. Lapang said of the total project cost of Rs 1,000 crore estimated by the UCIL, the latter would spend Rs 209 crore for the pre-development activities at the uranium mining sites of West Khasi Hills.         
	The UCIL has proposed two phases of the project. Out of the total project cost of Rs 1,000 crore, in the first phase, it will spend Rs 209 crore for the development activities like construction of roads, health centres and educational institutions before starting uranium mining.         
	In the second phase, the remaining amount will be spent once the project officially starts with approval from the state government.         
	Lapang, however, said the state government was yet to decide on giving a no-objection certificate to the UCIL to carry out uranium mining.         
	The government is planning to lease out land measuring around 422 acres in West Khasi Hills for 30 years to the UCIL to carry out uranium mining.         
	 Last year, the Centre and the Atomic Energy officials had conveyed to the state that the uranium-mining project would lead to overall development of the mining sites and several other areas of West Khasi Hills district.         
	They had also assured the state government that not a single family would be displaced while undertaking uranium mining. Despite this, the state NGOs continued to oppose the project citing health hazards.         
	On September 22 last year, principal adviser to department of atomic energy, V.P. Raja, had a meeting with the state government in Shillong on the issue. He said Delhi had not fixed any timeframe to start uranium mining in the state as both the Centre and state would work together to arrive at a consensus on the matter.         
	On August 22 last year, Union cabinet secretary K.M. Chandrashekar and chairman of the atomic energy commission Anil Kakodkar visited Shillong to discuss the need to carry out mining.

          OUR CORRESPONDENT                               
	Dibrugarh, Aug. 6: Four political science students of Dibrugarh University, including two girls, were today suspended for allegedly ragging three juniors.         
	The step was taken after three first-semester girl students from the universitys political science department submitted a written complaint to the vice-chancellor yesterday alleging that four third semester students had mentally tortured them by asking obscene questions in the name of ragging.         
	Besides suspending the four students, vice-chancellor K.K. Deka ordered an inquiry into the incident to be conducted by a four-member committee of the institution.         
	The universitys registrar, P.K. Bhuyan, said the four students were debarred from attending classes from today. The order will remain in force until disciplinary proceedings against them are completed.         
	The students placed under suspension are Mintu Jyoti Kalita, Monoranjan Kalita, Loni Dowerah and Meenakshi Bora.         
	Deka said, We have time and again issued warnings to our students not to indulge in ragging as the Centre and the University Grants Commission have taken a very tough stand on sweeping the menace out from campuses. If the students are found to be guilty, tough action will be taken against them.         
	The disciplinary committee met late in the afternoon today to discuss the issue. It is being headed by Bhimkanta Baruah, a professor of the department of Assamese. Its other members are Rupam Saikia, deputy registrar (administration), Mrigen Das, a professor of the department of political science, and Jyoti Rekha Hondique, a reader in the department of chemistry.         
	Saikia said the meeting remained inconclusive as the panel discussed the legalities involved in the matter. We are also studying the UGC guidelines laid down for tackling such incidents. We will resume discussion on Monday, he added.         
	Neither the accusers not the accused could be contacted as nobody in the campus could say anything about their whereabouts.         
	Of the accused, Mintu and Monoranjan are boarders of the Padma Nath Gohain Baruah Chatra Nivas.         
	Gunabhiram Dutta, a prefect of the lodges A block, said the incident was unfortunate but refused to make any other comment.         
	AASU general secretary Rituparna Barua said the guilty must be dealt with firmly. If they are found guilty, the university must take action against them according to the rules so that no one can harbour such ideas in the future.

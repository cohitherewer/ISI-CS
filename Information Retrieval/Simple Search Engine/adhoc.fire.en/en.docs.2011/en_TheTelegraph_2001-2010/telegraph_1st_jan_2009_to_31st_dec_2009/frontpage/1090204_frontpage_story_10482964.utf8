  - Shilpa and boyfriend pick up stake in IPL champ          SAMYABRATA RAY GOSWAMI                            Shilpa Shetty with Raj Kundra at a news conference in Mumbai. (PTI)                                        
	Mumbai, Feb. 3: Shilpa Shetty has done a Shah Rukh  or a Preity, if you like  and bought herself a slice of cricket.        
	The actress and her boyfriend Raj Kundra have picked up an 11.7 per cent stake in Rajasthan Royals, the champions in the first IPL season last year, for $15.4 million (Rs 75.5 crore).        
	I relate with them, they were the underdogs and they scored. I expect a re-run from them this year. Their story is exactly like mine  I have always been the underdog. I think when there is no expectation and you score, it really works, said Shilpa, whose career was sagging before Celebrity Big Brother made her a hot star overnight in Britain, which is also where her boyfriend is based.         
	Shilpa and Rajs purchase of stake puts the current valuation of the Rajasthan Royals at $140 million, said chairman Manoj Badale. This is more than double of the $67 million for which the team was bought last year, when it was the cheapest in the Indian Premier League.         
	I will cheer for the team, dance for a music video  bring in greater glamour in whichever way I can, promised the actress.        
	She would have learnt from Shah Rukh Khan, whose IPL debut she was witness to on April 18 last year.         
	Shilpa, who also made her Bollywood debut opposite Shah Rukh, was in the stands to cheer Vijay Mallyas Royal Challengers in the inaugural match that saw Shah Rukh egg his Knight Riders on to victory, dancing and chanting.        
	I believe that the addition of Shilpa Shetty creates a multitude of commercial opportunities  for sponsors, for merchandisers and for ancillary development opportunities, said boyfriend Raj, who owns a trading company in Dubai.        
	At the end of last season, the Knight Riders didnt score very high on cricket but Shah Rukhs aggressive marketing ensured they made profits.        
	Rajasthan Royals was the only other team to have made profits in the Indian Premier League, after starting out as the least fancied of the eight with captain Shane Warne its only star.         
	Hell have to share the spotlight now with Shilpa, but Warne wouldnt mind, especially if he can get a jadu ki jhappi once in a while. Preity Zinta, who co-owns Kings XI Punjab with boyfriend Ness Wadia, hugged her team in victory and defeat last season.         
	But Warne will have to be careful, as Richard Gere will tell him. A hug is all right, but a kiss could send him to jail. Two years ago, when the Hollywood star kissed Shilpa on the cheek on a Delhi stage, arrest warrants were issued against him in outraged Rajasthan and the Supreme Court had to step in to save his skin.         
	Shilpas foray into IPL makes her the fourth film star to own a team  other than Preity, who too made her film debut with SRK, theres Juhi Chawla who co-owns the Knight Riders.         
	Rajasthan Royals is the first IPL team to divest equity. We were looking to divest since the last three months as we were assured of a high valuation for the team. The plan is to take the Rajasthan Royals brand beyond cricket and transfer it to other sports  it could be golf, tennis  anything. We also have invitations to play tournaments abroad post IPL, said a top source in Emerging Media, the owners.

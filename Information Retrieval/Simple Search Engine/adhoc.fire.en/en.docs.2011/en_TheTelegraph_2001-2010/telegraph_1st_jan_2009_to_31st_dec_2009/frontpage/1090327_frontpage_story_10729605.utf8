	Bhubaneswar, March 26: Orissa chief minister and BJD president Naveen Patnaik today ruled out the possibility of going into seat-sharing talks with Jharkhand Mukti Morcha (JMM), while announcing that his party would go into seat adjustments with the CPI, the CPM and the NCP.         
	The BJD boss also released a list of 59 BJD candidates for 70 Assembly seats in the state and eight candidates for the 10 Lok Sabha seats, where the first phase of polling is scheduled for April 16. The remaining seats have been left for the three parties.         
	Naveen added that seat-sharing talks with the JMM failed after he sought a statement from its president, Shibu Soren, to clearly state that the JMM would not demand the inclusion of Mayurbhanj, Sundergarh and Keonjhar (in Orissa) to be part of Greater Jharkhand.         
	Since they have not come out with a statement on the matter, seat adjustment with the party is out of question, he said. The BJD will not yield any inch or part of Orissa, said the party chief.         
	Referring to the candidates list announced by the NCP, Naveen said it contained wrong number of seats and wrong names of candidates against certain seats.         
	We are discussing the matter with NCP chief Sharad Pawar, he said, indicating to the possibility of the list being modified.        
	He added that his discussions with two Left parties went very well and seat finalisation with the two would happen soon.        
	The eight BJD candidates for the Lok Sabha include three sitting party MLAs  Jayaram Pangi, Rudra Madhab Ray and Kalikesh Narayan Singhdeo. The list also includes former CPI state secretary Nityananda Pradhan, former youth Congress state president Rohit Pujari and Oriya film star Siddhant Mohapatra.         
	Prominent among the 59 Assembly candidates are Naveen Patnaik himself, Speaker Kishore Mohanty, 23 sitting MLAs and one sitting MP.

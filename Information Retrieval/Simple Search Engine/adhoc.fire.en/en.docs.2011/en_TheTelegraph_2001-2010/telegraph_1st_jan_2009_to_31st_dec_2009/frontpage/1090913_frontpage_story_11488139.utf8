          PTI AND OUR BUREAU                            A pilot hides his face after coming out of the Mumbai meeting. (AP)                                  
	Mumbai, Sept. 12: The Jet Airways management and pilots are understood to have reached an agreement, brightening the possibility of a five-day strike ending soon.        
	Indications of a resolution came after a seven-hour meeting here during which it was agreed that the pilots sacked by the airline would be reinstated. The pilots would not challenge a review of the registration of their union, the National Aviators Guild (NAG), by the Registrar of Trade Unions, according to sources.        
	Television reports said there would be no union but a welfare committee would be formed with representatives of the pilots. At midnight, the sources said a statement could be issued soon.        
	 The agitation, which saw almost 400 pilots affiliated to the NAG going on sick leave to protest the dismissal of their colleagues, is expected to end soon with the pilots poised to resume duty almost immediately.        
	Ahead of the meeting between the pilots and the Jet management, the airlines executive director, Saroj Dutta, addressed the pilots and appealed to them to end their agitation.        
	In the morning, the pilots had a meeting of their own where NAG leaders briefed them about the deliberations at the conciliatory proceedings.        
	On the fifth day of the strike, Jet cancelled 281 flights, of which 260 were domestic and 21 were scheduled to fly overseas. The airline normally operates 365 domestic and 74 international flights daily.        
	The negotiations in Mumbai today followed an extended meeting in Delhi between the two sides before the central labour commissioner on Friday.        
	We are trying our best to come to an amicable settlement, NAG president Girish Kaushik told reporters in the evening. The NAG was demanding that the Jet management recognise the union, which it has refused to do.        
	Kaushik had then said the pilots had received some proposals from Dutta and were trying to hammer out a draft that would be acceptable to both sides.        
	He iterated that the pilots under the NAG were prepared to fly the planes as soon as they had an agreement.        
	Late tonight, the sources said the two sides were poring over the wording of the agreement so that there were no disputes later.

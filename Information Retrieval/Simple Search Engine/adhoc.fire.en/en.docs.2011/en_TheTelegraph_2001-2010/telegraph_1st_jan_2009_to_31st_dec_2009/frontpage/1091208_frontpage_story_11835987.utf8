The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Nobel pitch for talent flow
                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                Nobel pitch for talent flow
  - Laureates juggle ideas and jokes before prize ceremony         AMIT ROY                             Ramakrishnan in Stockholm. (AFP)                                        
	Stockholm, Dec. 6: Scientists from India should be made more welcome in the West because freer exchange of ideas leads to better science, Venkatraman Ramakrishnan, one of the winners of the 2009 Nobel Prize for chemistry, said in Stockholm today.        
	Flanked by five other Nobel laureates in chemistry, physics and economics, Ramakrishnan, who has come to Sweden to receive his prize, appealed for a more liberal immigration policy, especially during a time of recession.        
	Todays media conference was held at the Royal Academy of Sciences with little lamps lighting the path in the darkness, Diwali-style, to the house where the Nobel prize winners and their families began the day with an early breakfast.        
	Ramakrishnan, 57, was born in Chidambaram, Tamil Nadu, and did his first degree at Baroda University and was based in the US for many years at Utah, Yale and Ohio universities before shifting to the UK to the Medical Research Council Laboratory of Molecular Research at Cambridge.        
	Tomorrow, he delivers a chemistry lecture and, on Thursday, receives his Nobel Prize from Carl XVI Gustaf, the king of Sweden. Later that day, President Barack Obama will be getting his Nobel Peace Prize in Oslo.        
	In response to a question from The Telegraph, Ramakrishnan said: I am actually a little, shall we say, uncomfortable about very restrictive immigration rules because I personally have been a beneficiary of being an immigrant in two different countries  the US, where I eventually became a citizen, and in Britain, where I have been working for the last decade.         
	Ramakrishnan explained: I think we live in a world where there is a free flow of capital and free flow of goods.        
	But this was not so about free flow of people. We are happy to import software from India and China but we are not so happy to import Indians and Chinese into western society. I think that is fundamentally wrong. Of course, immigrants also have a duty to adapt to their host countries but we should all be more interactive.         
	The assembled Nobel laureates were asked by Gunnar Quist, secretary general of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences, to disclose what had sparked their interest in science. He also invited them to provide the blue print of ideal research environment  those in Calcutta who wish to breathe new life into Presidency College could do worse than get a full transcript of the media conference.        
	What in your upbringing caught your interest in science? Quist asked.         
	Ramakrishnan, who has come to Stockholm accompanied by his author wife, Vera Rosenberry, told his tale. I have to say that my parents were both scientists so it was not every imaginative for me to want to become a scientist. When I was growing up in India, it was traditional for very bright students to go into medicine or engineering.        
	When I was in the first year in college, my mother actually suggested that I take a special scholarship exam, which was modelled after the Westinghouse science scholarships (in America) by the Government of India. The restriction on that scholarship was that you had go into basic sciences. So I decided to do that. It involved a short research project which further stimulated my interest and then there were professors there who had just returned from the US and completely revamped the physics curriculum with the result there is (today) a very modern physics curriculum in that university  which is Baroda University. That is what resulted into my going into basic science rather than the more traditional route that many students take.         
	He talked of the high reputation of the MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology in Cambridge. Its staff have won several Nobel prizes  I think I am number 15 or something (number 29 by other calculations) on their list. People think of it as a Nobel Prize factory  its a complete misnomer because it confuses cause for effect.         
	Ramakrishnan argued: It does not do good science because it wins Nobel Prizes  it is the other way round. There are several complimentary aspects to it. There is very stable funding the MRC for long term challenging projects which dont have immediate pay off. There is a tradition of working in very small groups so that senior scientists are aware of the day to day science that goes on. The other is it is highly interactive  everything is shared. More and more there is an emphasis in not doing things with an immediate pay off but to focus on the real important issues in your field.         
	Ramakrishnan received strong support from Ada Yonath, of the Weizmann Institute of Science in Israel, and Thomas A Steitz, of Harvard, his chemistry co-winners.         
	I was a curious kid, said Yonath. Since the age of four or five I did my own experiments. My father was a Rabbi - he did not practice  (and) my mother hardly had any education but they were very supportive. I had excellent teachers at school. When I came to the Weizmann Institute, I found people who did research for the sake of research. We were not as pushed as life is now for young scientists.         
	Yonath, once a rival to Ramakrishnan but now a good friend, was also keen on collaboration. Chemists? We are the masters of talking to each other  I do feel talking is very important not only in chemistry or physics or economics but for human beings all over. May be if you talk more, some of the problems in the world you see today would be minimised or may be even disappear.         
	As she departed after the media conference, she told The Telegraph she had considered risking a bad joke. She had thought of saying: They are happy to import iPods from China because iPods dont eat.        
	Steitz, a close friend of Ramakrishnan, disclosed: I was always interested in science in high school. I found it a fun thing to do  science and math. But I was also very interested in music so I was, at least, two hours a day practising the saxophone and singing and I realised I could do science and get paid and music on the side or music and not get paid.         
	For a while, he worked in the Cambridge lab where Ramakrishnan is now based. What a fabulous place where Venki is  coffee in the morning, lunch in the afternoon, tea in the afternoon. I wondered how does anybody get any science done. It is because they are talking to each other. They are learning what experiments they should do and what they shouldnt do. It was a great community of interactive scientists and it was my model of how a laboratory should be set up because you benefit both in terms of the fun and in terms of the creativity. Science is not done in a closet.         
	Like Ramakrishnan, he was also for greater international exchange.         
	Steitz said: All of us go to many international meetings and conferences in various parts of the world and we get to meet colleagues working in the same or similar areas quite frequently. I think this is very important to the development of science and science ideas. I often feel I have much closer friends in Europe than houses down the street where I live because I get to meet them and interact with them and exchange ideas which are common goals and common ideals.         
	Co-winner of the economics prize, Elinor Ostrom of Indiana University, made a point that people at Presidency, for example, might try to appreciate: Development of good solid science requires environments in which you can discuss future ideas, some of your recent findings, some of your puzzles, where you would like to go. I have benefited greatly from that environment.         
	The physicists, Willard S. Boyle and George E. Smith, who had worked at the Bell Labs in New Jersey, made physics sound fun.         
	Boyle, who lives in retirement in Nova Scotia in his native Canada, told journalists: You cannot imagine what it is like (to win a Nobel Prize)  because two months ago I was a guy walking down the street like anybody else. And here look at me now.         
	Its real scary and also very rewarding. I am really going to make an effort to enjoy it and not let it get me down.         
	Smith said: I started out wanting to be a mathematician. I was good at it. Then I decided it was too boring and so switched to physics. The people who do research should have the freedom to be able to choose the programmes. I dont think you can have a business plan.         
	After the conference, Oliver E. Williamson, who had spoken of the pleasure of being argumentative, was asked whether he had read The Argumentative Indian by Amartya Sen, who had also won the Nobel Prize for economics (in 1998).         
	I was at Berkeley when he came to speak, recalled Williamson. What a wonderful human being.         
	One of the best quips at todays conference came from Yonath when the Laureates were asked why Nobel Prizes were dominated by Americans.         
	I think because they are very good, she summed up.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Hottest April day in decade 
                                                                                                           Hottest April day in decade 
          A STAFF REPORTER                                        
	Calcutta, April 18: The city sweltered today with the mercury rising to 40.8C, five degrees above normal and the highest April temperature in over a decade. The discomfort index was a cruel 13C above normal.        
	The discomfort index is calculated on the basis of temperature, wind-flow pattern, humidity and some other factors. The normal discomfort index in Calcutta at this time of the year is equivalent to 55C  that is, a resident feels as uncomfortable as he would feel in temperatures of 55C if all the other factors were at the highest comfort level (for instance, if humidity were zero).        
	Today, the discomfort level would have been worse had humidity not been at a low of 28 per cent in the afternoon. Even the minimum temperature was three degrees above normal  27.7C  and there was no rain either.        
	The forecast for Sunday offers little relief: the maximum temperature will hover around 39C with the possibility of rain or a thundershower in the evening or night.        
	Dry and hot northwesterly and westerly winds blew into Bengal from Gujarat, Maharashtra and Chhattisgarh; thats why Calcutta experienced such high temperatures, said D.N. Talapatra, the director of the Regional Meteorological Centre at Alipore.        
	There was also a dearth of moisture in the lower troposphere (the lowest portion of Earths atmosphere) leading to a lack of cloud cover. Calcutta had clear skies through the day and intense heat from solar insulation.        
	Still, its not a heat wave. A heat wave is declared when such conditions persist over a prolonged period, a senior official from the Alipore Met office said.        
	The highest ever April temperature in the city was 43.3C, recorded on April 25, 1954. The maximum temperature in April last crossed 40C on April 30, 1995, to reach 41.1C. Since then, the closest the city has come to 40C in April has been 39.6C, recorded on April 20 last year.        
	This April has been one of the cruellest in the city, with April 7 being the hottest in 10 years with temperatures of 38.9C. The heat caused the death of two Calcuttans.        
	This years temperature rise in Calcutta is in keeping with global trends. Projections in the latest Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report suggest that global surface temperatures could rise by 1.1C to 6.4C during the 21st century.        
	During 1999-2008, mean global temperatures rose generally between 0.5C and 2C, with Calcutta witnessing a rise of 0.5C to 1C.

                                                                                                           Murder fury singes Imphal
  - Government clamps indefinite curfew in greater Imphal after bursts of sporadic violence          OUR CORRESPONDENT                                           
	Imphal, Feb. 19: An indefinite curfew was clamped in greater Imphal today as the state capital and the valley burned with anger and grief over the brutal murder of three government staff, whose killers remained untraced.         
	Speaking for the first time after the battered bodies of subdivisional officer Thingnam Kishan, his driver Aribam Rajen Sharma and chainman Yumnam Token, were found in Senapati, chief minister Okram Ibobi Singh today said: We have certain clues about who are behind the abduction and murder of the officials. But it is premature to make it public.        
	Sporadic bursts of violence singed Imphal Valley on the second day of the 48-hour Manipur bandh called by a public joint action committee to protest the killings.        
	People spilled on the streets and damaged vehicles before setting them ablaze.        
	As the protests began spinning out of control in both Imphal West and Imphal East, police were forced to lob tear gas shells to disperse unruly mobs.         
	The Naga-dominated Tamenglong district also observed a separate bandh today against the killings.         
	Soon after the reports of violence began pouring in, the government suspended Ukhrul district deputy commissioner Pankaj Kumar Pal and superintendent of police Lhari Dorjee Lhatoo over the murders. Ibobi Singh also constituted a committee comprising agriculture commissioner . Nabakishore Singh and inspector-general (intelligence) L.M. Khaute to probe the murder case and official lapses.         
	The government is making all possible efforts to book the culprits, the chief minister said.        
	We will not spare anyone involved in it.         
	The three village staff, Ramsing Tangkhul and Ramthing Tangkhul and Khamkhasing Zimik, who went missing with SDO Kishan on February 13, are still missing.         
	The six had left in a Gypsy for Kasom Khullen in Ukhrul where works minister T. Ranjit Singh was scheduled to visit.        
	They never reached the site. The bodies of the SDO, his driver and chainman were recovered from Senapati on Tuesday.        
	A police team led by inspector-general of police (land order-III) V. Zathang rushed to Nongdam in Ukhrul this morning following information that three bodies were found there.         
	But on reaching the spot, the police could not find any bodies.         
	Ibobi Singh said there was information that the three missing officials were still alive and in the custody of the unidentified kidnappers.         
	Chief secretary Rakesh Singh and director-general of police Yumnam Joykumar Singh questioned the deputy commissioner and the superintendent of police yesterday to probe lapses in handling the kidnapping case.         
	They did not inform the kidnapping on time to the chief secretary and the director-general of police. The probe panel will find out everything related to the case, Ibobi Singh said.         
	No time frame has been given to the two-man panel, but Ibobi Singh, who is also the home minister, directed the officers to submit the report as soon as possible.         
	The chief minister said his government has decided to induct Romita Devi, widow of the SDO in the Manipur Civil Service and find a suitable job for any one in the families of the two other officials.         
	This is in addition to the Rs 10 lakh for the SDOs family and Rs 5 lakh each for the other two officials announced by the government earlier as ex gratia.        
	In an unrelated development, a team of police and Assam Rifles shot dead a Kangleipak Communist Party militant at Tentha in Thoubal district today.

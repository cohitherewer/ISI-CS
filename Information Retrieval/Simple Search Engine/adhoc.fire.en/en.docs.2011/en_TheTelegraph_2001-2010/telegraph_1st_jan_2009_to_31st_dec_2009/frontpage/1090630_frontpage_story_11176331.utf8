          JACK HEALY                            Madoff                                  
	New York, June 29: A federal judge sentenced Bernard L. Madoff to 150 years in prison today for operating a huge Ponzi scheme that devastated thousands of people, calling his crimes extraordinarily evil.        
	In pronouncing the sentence  the maximum he could have handed down  Judge Denny Chin turned aside Madoffs own assertions of remorse and rejected the suggestion from Madoffs lawyers that there was a sense of mob vengeance surrounding calls for a long prison term.         
	Objectively speaking, the fraud here was staggering, the judge said. It spanned more than 20 years.        
	The sentencing came at the end of a 90-minute hearing in which victims of the $65 billion fraud told a packed courtroom that the judge should show no mercy and Madoff himself stood up from the defence table to acknowledge express regret.        
	Im responsible for a great deal of suffering and pain, I understand that, the 71-year-old financier told the court.         
	I live in a tormented state now, knowing all of the pain and suffering that Ive created. Ive left a legacy of shame, as some of my victims have pointed out, to my family and my grandchildren.        
	Addressing his victims seated in the courtroom, he said: I will turn and face you. Im sorry. I know that doesnt help you.

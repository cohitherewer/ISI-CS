	Washington, June 3: American and South Korean officials say Kim Jong-il, the North Korean dictator recovering from a stroke, appears to have designated his youngest son as his successor.         
	Kim may have ordered the countrys second nuclear test last week in hopes of leaving his son in control of a country that has cemented its status as a nuclear-weapons state.        
	Little is known about the youngest son, Kim Jong-un, beyond reports that he was secretly schooled in Switzerland under an assumed name, posing as the son of a driver in the nearby North Korean embassy. He skied Switzerlands famous slopes, and was a fan of Michael Jordan.         
	Even Kim Jong-uns age is uncertain; he is believed to be in his mid-20s.         
	But his path to power is hardly assured: some intelligence officials believe that everyone from the North Korean military to Kim Jong-ils eldest son may be plotting behind the scenes to derail the succession plans, and North Koreas last ally, China, is reportedly deeply uncomfortable with the thought of a third-generation family dynasty, unique among communist nations.         
	In recent weeks, North Korean diplomats abroad have been told to begin to pay homage to Kim Jong-un and some schoolchildren have reportedly been including his name in their songs.         
	His rise comes at the expense of his 38-year-old brother, Kim Jong-nam, best known for the moment when he was caught slipping into Japan on a false passport.         
	At the USs Central Intelligence Agency, Kim Jong-uns picture used to be posted in the Asia division, and analysts gave him the moniker of the Cute Leader  a play on his fathers status as Dear Leader and his grandfathers as Great Leader.

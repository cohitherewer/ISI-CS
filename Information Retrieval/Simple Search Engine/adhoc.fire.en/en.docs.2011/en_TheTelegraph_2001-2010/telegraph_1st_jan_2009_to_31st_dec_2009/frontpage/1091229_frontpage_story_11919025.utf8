	Ranchi, Dec. 28: When the BJP looks Left to bail itself out, the problem is acute.        
	In an effort to defend the partys alliance with the JMM, BJP MP and former chief minister Arjun Munda indicated today they would play the role of a watchdog in the states new dispensation, much like the Left in the former UPA government at the Centre.         
	Though we are part of the government, will not hesitate to make it accountable to the public. Our working relation with the JMM will be like the Lefts relations with the Congress, he told The Telegraph on a day JMM chief Shibu Soren flew down to Mumbai and New Delhi to meet the BJP and JD(U) top brass.        
	Soren, who will be sworn in on Wednesday, has now been asked by the governor to seek a vote of confidence on January 8. Munda, who in all likelihood would be made state party in-charge after present incumbent Raghubar Das became leader of the legislature party, said the alliance between the two big political groups was undertaken to respect the mandate.         
	The alliance, though forged out of political compulsion, could be taken as a natural one. But we expect a government accountable to the people, he said, adding a common minimum programme was on the way.        
	We will soon be preparing a blueprint for the common minimum programme which will decide the agenda of the government led by Soren, Munda said.        
	Mundas stand was reflective of the internal debate raging within the BJP for joining hands with the JMM with whom the party did not see eye to eye on a host of issues, including Maoist terror, industrialisation and the states domicile policy.        
	Both the BJP and JMM saw a common enemy in Babulal Marandi, whose JVM won 11 seats in the Assembly elections, relegating the BJP to a fringe player in the Santhal Paragana. So, the new political alignment was the natural outcome to ward off the immediate threat, pointed out a BJP leader.

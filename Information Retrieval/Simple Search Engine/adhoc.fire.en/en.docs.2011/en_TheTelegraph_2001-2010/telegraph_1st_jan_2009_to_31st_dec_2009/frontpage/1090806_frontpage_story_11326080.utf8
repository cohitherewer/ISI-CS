	Jamshedpur, Aug. 5: A 21-year-old software student from Jamshedpur, who recently returned from Boston, US, has been diagnosed with swine flu.         
	East Singhbhum nodal officer Swarn Singh, appointed two days ago by the civil surgeons office to monitor the pandemic flu situation in the district where two cases had been suspected earlier, said Gopal Kumar Tiwary was the first to test positive in the state. He has been confined to his home and administered a dose of the anti-flu drug, Singh said.        
	A resident of Kadma, Gopal returned from the US, where he had been studying for the past two months, on July 23. Soon thereafter, he ran high fever and complained of sore throat  both symptoms of H1N1 infection. Throat swab samples of the patient were sent to the National Institute for Cholera and Enteric Diseases, Calcutta, on Sunday. The report that reached us yesterday night has confirmed swine flu, Singh said.        
	Gopal, who was planning to head for Singapore on Friday, has reportedly refused to be quarantined at any state hospital. The revised central guidelines allow home confinement if the illness is mild. I have checked on the patient and he can be treated at home. However, we have requested his family members to take precautions like washing hands with soap and keeping a distance from the patient. Cleanliness at the quarantine is a must, too, said district civil surgeon Deepali Dey.        
	Dr Pradeep Baski, the state nodal officer for pandemic flu, said he had been informed and was waiting for a formal report on the case.        
	Meanwhile, the district administration has stepped up surveillance at stations. Passengers arriving from Pune, which saw the first death of a swine flu victim  Rida Sheikh  in the country, are being strictly monitored. Two more students of Ridas school also tested positive today.        
	The Howrah-Pune Azad Hind Express that passes through Tatanagar junction is under watch. Besides, the airport authorities have been directed to keep an eye on passengers with symptoms of pandemic flu. We do not want to take a risk. If we suspect a case, nasal and throat swabs will be sent to Calcutta for tests, Dey said.         
	She added that isolation wards had been set up at MGM Medical College and Hospital and Tata Main Hospital after two suspected cases of swine flu were reported earlier. However, both tested negative for the virus.        
	With Gopal, the number of laboratory-confirmed cases of H1N1 in India has climbed to 576. The virus has infected more than 134,000 people across 135 countries and killed 816.

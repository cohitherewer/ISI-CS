          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                              
	New Delhi, Jan. 25: Manmohan Singh is recuperating fast, has spoken to family members and wants to resume work, doctors said a day after the Prime Minister underwent a complex and high-risk 11-hour bypass surgery.        
	Hes making excellent progress, said K. Srinath Reddy, a senior cardiologist who has been involved in Singhs diagnosis and treatment. He is breathing on his own and fully conscious, and he has been talking to family members and doctors.        
	A team of doctors from the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) here and the Asian Heart Institute, Mumbai, had on Saturday jointly performed surgery to provide Singhs heart five grafts  new blood vessels  to address five blockages in his arteries.        
	The Prime Minister is currently in an intensive care unit at AIIMS, where his heart, lungs and kidneys are under continuous observation as part of a routine medical drill which every patient who has undergone major surgery experiences.        
	Singh drank some fruit juice and coconut water today and is likely to receive only a liquid diet until tomorrow, doctors said. His hearts performance is excellent, said Ramakanta Panda, the cardiothoracic surgeon from the AHI.        
	He is eager to return to work. Hes expressed this wish frequently today, Reddy said.        
	After the surgery had ended at 7.30pm on Saturday, Singh had been initially placed on a ventilator  a machine that helps a person breathe. Doctors said Singh was taken off the ventilator at 1am today and has been breathing on his own.        
	His progress has been better than we anticipated, said Sampath Kumar, the head of cardiothoracic surgery at AIIMS. But he doesnt want to meet visitors right now, Kumar said.        
	Critical care specialist Vijay DSilva from the AHI and his colleagues are monitoring Singh in the intensive care unit. Hes receiving the same care that is given to other patients who have undergone a similar major bypass surgery, DSilva said.        
	Doctors from both AIIMS and the AHI today asserted that the AHI team was invited only because it had much greater experience in repeat bypass procedures than AIIMS doctors.         
	Singhs message        
	Kumar read from a piece of paper in which, he said, he had transcribed what Singh had told doctors when they visited him this morning.         
	The Prime Minister told me, Kumar said, I chose AIIMS because I am confident about its abilities, (and) to encourage the public to have confidence in AIIMS. I hope the ordinary man will get the same quality of care that I have got here.

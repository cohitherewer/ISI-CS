	Bhopal, Feb. 25: Gyanendra Bir Bikram Shah, the deposed monarch of Nepal, will be in Bhopal tomorrow for a wedding.         
	King Gyanendra is coming from the girls side while I happen to be the father of the groom, his local host, K.K. Singh, said.        
	Singh, a Congress leader who recently lost the Assembly polls from Sidhi district, is related to Union human resource development minister Arjun Singh.        
	Gyanendra left Kathmandu for Delhi today with 14 family members, including wife Komal and sister Shobha Shahi, travelling as a commoner on a Jet Airways flight. He used a regular green passport like any other Nepali citizen, after the Maoist-led government declined to issue him a diplomatic passport.         
	The two-week trip to India is Gyanendras first foreign tour since losing the throne in May 2008.         
	He was, however, allowed the use of the VVIP lounge and offered quick immigration and security clearances.         
	Smartly turned out in a blue suit, he did not speak to the large media contingent waiting at the airport.        
	Gyanendra is to attend a couple of weddings in India, where he has relatives.        
	The wedding in Bhopal is on February 27. Singh said Gyanendra is expected to attend several functions spread over three days.         
	Explaining the ties, Singh said Gyanendras grandfather King Tribhuvan had three sons and four daughters. One of the daughters, Bharati, married the former king of Mayurbhanj in Orissa, Pradeep Chandra Bhanj Deo.         
	One of their daughters and Gyanendras cousin, the Calcutta-born Padma Manjari, married Udit Pratap Deo of the former royal family of Kalahandi. Gyanendra is coming to Bhopal for the wedding of Padma Manjaris daughter.         
	The marriage ceremony will take place in Bhopal on February 27, where my son Anant Vijay Singh will tie the nuptial knot with Shree, daughter of the Maharaja of Kalhanadi, Orissa, Udit Pratap Deo, Singh said.         
	The last king of the Shah dynasty is also planning to visit some Hindu shrines, including the Somnath temple at Dwarka in Gujarat.         
	The state BJP government has not accorded official status to Gyanendras visit, sources said.                    WITH INPUTS FROM J. HEMANTH IN KATHMANDU

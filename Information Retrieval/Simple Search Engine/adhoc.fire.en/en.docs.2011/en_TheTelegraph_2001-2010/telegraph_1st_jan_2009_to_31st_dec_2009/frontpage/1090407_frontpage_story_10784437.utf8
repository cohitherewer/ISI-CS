          VIVEK CHHETRI                               
	Darjeeling, April 6: The BJP decision to field Jaswant Singh in the Darjeeling Lok Sabha constituency has triggered a rush in rival camps, with the Congress and the CPM vying to bring in party heavyweights to campaign for their candidates.         
	Singh, who had been in charge of external affairs, finance and defence portfolios at different times, is expected to reach Darjeeling tomorrow. Both the Congress and the CPM are trying hard to negate Singhs high profile status.         
	Dawa Narbula, the sitting Congress MP, said party president Sonia Gandhi would come to Siliguri on April 27 to campaign for him. Asked if there was a possibility of Rahul Gandhi visiting the region, Narbula said: Lets see. We are trying.         
	The CPM is also not taking things lying low. We will organise a public meeting at Chowk Bazar on April 21 and Sitaram Yechury will be there, said Asok Bhattacharya, the CPM MLA of Siliguri and the urban development minister.        
	 The Congress and the CPM were reluctant to admit that the BJP had fielded a heavyweight. The heavyweight is decided by the people, said Narbula.         
	The CPM was more forthright in admitting that Singhs stature was unquestionable. He is a bigwig for he was once an external affairs minister and also a defence minister. But he had not had much success in the Lok Sabha election, said Bhattacharya.         
	The Gorkha Janmukti Morcha, which is trying to cash in on Singhs stature, has already asked other BJP heavyweights to campaign for him. We have invited L.K. Advani, Rajnath Singh and Sushma Swaraj to visit the hills. We are confident that they will come to campaign, said Binay Tamang, the media and publicity secretary of the Morcha.         
	Political observers believe that Gurung, who was instrumental in making Singh contest from Darjeeling, has already won the first round of the poll battle. In the previous general elections, no heavyweights had ever come to Darjeeling to campaign. A beeline of big leaders to Darjeeling means that the Morcha has been successful in getting its agenda recognised at the national level, said an observer.         
	The last time a slew of national leaders had come to Darjeeling was in 1986 at the time of the Gorkhaland agitation. However, Sonia Gandhi had visited Alipurduar during the last Assembly elections to campaign for the Congress candidate.

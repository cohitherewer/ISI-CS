	Washington, June 23: At least nine people were killed and at least 75 injured when one Metro subway train slammed into another on the outskirts of the city during the afternoon rush hour yesrerday, emergency officials said.        
	It looks to be the worst Metro accident in DC history, said Mayor Adrian M. Fenty.        
	The general manager of the Metro system, John B. Catoe Jr., said one train had stopped near a platform and was waiting for permission to proceed when it was hit from behind by the second train.         
	Catoe did not speculate on whether safety devices intended to prevent such crashes had failed. A National Transportation Safety Board spokesman said that there were nine investigators on the scene and that all recent safety recommendations the board had made to the city transit system were being reviewed.        
	At the scene, one subway car sat fully on top of a car from the other train. The car on top had part of its floor sheared off, and the wreckage was a jumble of twisted metal.         
	Several passengers were carried off on stretchers, and rescue crews used ladders and heavy equipment to cut into the wreckage and reach passengers stuck inside. Helicopters buzzed overhead. The police scrambled to coordinate traffic, onlookers and the rescue workers.        
	Emergency medical personnel set up a triage site at the nearby Jarboe Printing Company. Rescue officials said about 75 passengers were treated for injuries. At least three persons were seriously injured and the rest had only minor injuries. Numerous people walked away from the crash site wearing bandages, slings and in at least one case, a neck brace.        
	Among the dead was the operator of the train that crashed into the stopped one. She was identified by the mayors office as Jeanice McMillan, 42.        
	The crash occurred around 5pm on a heavily travelled Metro route, the Red Line, that shuttles thousands of commuters every day from the suburbs into the city. It occurred between the Takoma and Fort Totten stations, where there is a long stretch of track, meaning trains often reach high speeds.

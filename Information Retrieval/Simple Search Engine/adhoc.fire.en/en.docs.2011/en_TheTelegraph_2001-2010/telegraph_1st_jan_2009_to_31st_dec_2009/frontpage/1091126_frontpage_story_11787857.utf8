	Patamda, Nov. 25: Amid a sea of securitymen in battle fatigues, residents of Patamda thumbed their nose at a Maoist poll boycott and came out in large numbers to record over 50 per cent voting in this Naxalite stronghold, setting a trend that is sure to influence turnout in the four remaining phases of the Assembly elections.        
	Patamda, a rebel infested zone within the Jugsalai (reserved) constituency, is dominated by Mahtos and wore a festive look despite the huge presence of securitymen. And if the elderly, including men and women, came out to vote in large numbers  certain villages in the interiors recorded over 70 per cent polling  it was because of Ajsu local candidate Ramchandra Shahis.        
	We did not turn up to vote in the last parliamentary elections. But, this time, we are here to cast our votes even though Naxalites had undertaken a poster campaign calling for a poll boycott, said Janardhan Mahto of Shahiss Muchidih village.         
	The anti-incumbency mood against JMMs Dulal Bhuiyan was so strong that even a serious Maoist threat failed to dampen the spirits. Though we were apprehensive of danger from Naxalites, we had to support Shahis, who is not only a local candidate, but also a dynamic person, claimed Mahto.        
	Another villager, Ramakant Mahto of adjoining Dhubni village, echoed Janardhan. We were fed up with JMMs Bhuiyan, whom we blindly voted to power last time. But he disappointed us greatly.         
	Vibhishan Mahto, a resident of Pagda village, attributed the high turnout to a wave for change. Yahan parivartan ka lahar hai. Hamein Ramchandra Shahis chahiye, Dulal Bhuiyan nahin. Agar yeh lahar nahin hota, log sadak per nahin dikhte. (Actually, there was a wave for change. We want Ramchandra Shahis and not Dulal Bhuiyan. If there was no such wave, then people wouldnt have turned up for voting), said Vibhishan Mahto, a resident of Pagda village.         
	The local administration, in conjunction with security forces, had taken several measures to build confidence among people. While every nook and cranny was packed with the men in fatigues, the administrations had banned the movement of all kinds of vehicles, except cycles, in the constituency.        
	At some places, even two-wheelers werent allowed to curb the free movement of unwanted elements. This led to some degree of inconvenience for voters in a few areas, but nothing serious enough to affect the trend of an enthusiastic election.                          
	A resident of Bangurda village, Apurva Mahanty alleged that the security forces prevented him from riding his bike with his younger brother, Umesh, at Beltand More.         
	Some family members wanted to come to Bangurda, but I stopped them from proceeding towards Patamda as the securitymen had stopped my bike, said Mahanty senior who had come from Sakchi in Jamshedpur to cast his vote.        
	Throughout the day, security forces held flag marches across the length and breath of Patamda  another means to instil confidence among an already enthusiastic group of residents.

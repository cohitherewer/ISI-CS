          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      Framed?                          
	Patna, Sept. 10: A key witness, whose deposition led to summons being issued to chief minister Nitish Kumar in connection with a 1991 murder of a Congress activist, has revealed that he was offered money to make the allegation, sparking a political storm in Bihar today.        
	Ramanand Singh has confessed before police that he was chosen by Congress worker Amaresh to depose as a witness against the chief minister and that he acted under pressure after being offered Rs 10,000 by him.         
	His volte-face, recorded by the Barh CJM court today under Section 164 of the CrPc, has understandably sparked an avalanche of protest with both the ruling JD(U) and the Opposition Congress blaming each other for using the murder of Congress activist Sitaram Singh for political gain.        
	Both Ramanand and Amaresh were arrested from the house of Congress leader and former MP Arun Kumar on Tuesday.        
	Amaresh, who the police presented before the media today, said he chose Ramanand from Dhiber village  under the Pandarak police station area of Barh  and persuaded him to depose against the chief minister at the behest of Arun Kumar. That deposition led to the Barh chief judicial magistrate issuing summons against Nitish.         
	Patna senior superintendent of police Vineet Vinayak said he constituted a police team to search for Ramanand after receiving a missing persons complaint from his son, Chandan.         
	The team found both Ramanand and Amaresh in Arun Kumars home near Ashiana Chowk, he said.        
	The ruling JD(U) has described the incident as a conspiracy to destabilise the government. The chief ministers rivals are trying to frame him in a 18-year-old case, said state JD(U) chief Lallan Singh.        
	Not to be outdone, the state Congress described the detention of Ramanand Singh and Amaresh as misuse of police power by the ruling establishment. The witness had come to my house to meet me, when a plain clothed policeman came in and arrested him and party worker Amaresh, Arun Kumar explained.        
	State BPCC president Anil Sharma described Chandans kidnap complaint as a police fabrication at the behest of the chief minister and his supporters.         
	This case involves the murder of a Congress activist and Nitish stands named as an accused. Our party will pursue the case to its logical conclusion, he said.        
	Patna SSP, however, said that Chandan had lodged a written complaint with Pandarak police station following which the police swung into action. Ramanand and Amaresh are still in police detention. The police will register a case of kidnapping against Arun Kumar.        
	Sitaram had been gunned down at a Pandarak booth in Barh constituency during the 1991 Lok Sabha elections.         
	Nitish Kumar who won the seat was named accused with several others.         
	The prosecution had submitted a final form giving a clean chit to Nitish, which Barh court admitted in 2008. However, Ashok Singh, a distant relative of Sitaram Singh, challenged the courts admission.

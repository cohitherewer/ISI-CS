  - Climate laggards to hear Green Girl at UN meet          K.P. NAYAR                                                 Yugratna Srivastava		      
	New York, Sept. 21: Prime Minister Manmohan Singhs predictable absence from a one-day climate change summit at the UN opening here tomorrow will be symbolically made up by a 13-year-old girl from Lucknow, Yugratna Srivastava.        
	Tomorrow, instead of Singh, she will share the UN General Assemblys familiar podium with UN secretary-general Ban Ki-moon, US President Barack Obama, Chinese President Hu Jintao, French President Nicolas Sarkozy, the new Japanese Prime Minister Yukio Hatoyama and Nobel peace laureate and environmentalist Wangari Maathai at the opening of the climate change summit.        
	Yugratna, who became sensitised to the destruction of the planet by climate change at St Francis School in Shamli, Uttar Pradesh, when she was barely 10 years old, is already a global presence on efforts to save the earth from environmental hazards.         
	Watching her with inevitable fascination in the General Assembly hall tomorrow morning will be 124 world leaders, many of them Presidents and Prime Ministers.        
	Among those listening to little Yugratna, the only Indian to be elected last year to the junior board of the Tunza youth conference organised by the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), will be external affairs minister S.M. Krishna, minister of state for environment Jairam Ramesh and the Prime Ministers special envoy for climate change, Shyam Saran.        
	It is an irony that when they speak later tomorrow at various roundtables that are part of the summit, none of them will verbalise how deeply their young compatriot feels for the earth that is under siege from environmental depradations.        
	Indian policy is deeply mired in uncertainties over how to approach climate change and is subject to contradictory pulls and pressures as a landmark conference on the issue in Copenhagen approaches in December.        
	Several years ago, as she began to learn about the environment, Yugratna joined a non-government organisation, Tarumitra or Friends of Trees.         
	Started in Patna 21 years ago by environmentally aware students, Tarumitra has spread all over India and has two lakh members in over 1,000 high schools and colleges.         
	This NGOs mission is to stop deforestation, build roadside gardens and clean up garbage among other similar initiatives.        
	In June last year, Yugratna was among 21 students belonging to Tarumitra who had the opportunity to attend a Tunza international children and youth conference in Norway organised by the UNEP.         
	Tunza in Swahili means to treat with care or affection and the theme of the Norway conference was to treat Mother Earth similarly in the context of environmental protection.        
	On the last day of the conference, Yugratna was among seven participants elected to the junior board to advise UNEP on organising the next Tunza conference in South Korea.        
	Participants from 105 countries voted in the election. Under Tunza rules, participants are not allowed to vote for candidates from their own country and Yugratnas election was, therefore, an acknowledgement of her committment to environmental issues and her performance in Norway.        
	She defeated her Chinese rival for the Asian seat on the junior board.        
	When Yugratna takes the floor before world leaders in the General Assembly hall tomorrow, she will be speaking on behalf of 1 million young people who are marching in 100 world capitals on the eve of the UN summit today appealing to world leaders to sign a definitive climate change agreement at the Copenhagen conference in December.        
	Tomorrow, even as Yugratna speaks at the summit, children are being asked worldwide to wear green, do something green and dress your town green according to the UNEP.        
	For my generation in India, climate change means global warming, scarcity of food and drinking water and an outbreak of accentuated epidemics, Yugratna said today in an email sent through Satinder Bindra, UNEPs director of communications.         
	World leaders must recognise the energy and potential which lies in children and youth. This age group is just like flowing rivers and they make their own way in the direction in which they march, she added.

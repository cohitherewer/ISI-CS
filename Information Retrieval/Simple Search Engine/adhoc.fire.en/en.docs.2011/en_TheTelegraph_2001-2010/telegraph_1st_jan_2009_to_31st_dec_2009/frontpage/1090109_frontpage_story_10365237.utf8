The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Soren loses poll, clings to power   At Delhi door   with egg on face

	Bundu/Ranch, Jan. 8: Jharkhand chief minister Shibu Soren lost the election he needed to win to stay on in power as a lesser-known opponent from a coalition partner romped home in an embarrassing verdict for the ruling UPA.        
	Soren, however, delayed stepping down and left for Delhi for talks with senior alliance leaders.        
	The JMM veteran blamed his defeat on the ignorance of tribal voters. They do not understand the importance of a particular election, he said.        
	The victor, Raja Peter, and his mentor, Jharkhand Party chief Anosh Ekka, said it was a defeat of an individual and the chief ministers chair shouldnt be dragged into it.        
	I dont believe in making tall promises, Peter, seen as a local Robin Hood, said. Our villages lack both drinking water and irrigation facilities. I will do my best.        
	The Tamar bypoll verdict means another round of uncertainty for the state that has seen six chief ministers in the last eight years.        
	By evening, Soren  who polled 25,154 votes, over 9,000 less than Peter  had left for Delhi with Madhu Koda, the man he had ousted a few months back, and human resource minister Bandhu Tirkey to lobby for a successor of his choice.        
	Ekka, too, got into the fray. Projecting himself as a kingmaker, he made it clear that neither he nor Peter would support a leader chosen by Soren and remained non-committal on whether he would back the NDA or a Congress or RJD candidate.         
	Asked if he would support a government headed by Koda, Ekka said he would discuss the issue with party leaders.                 
	I dont want to comment on the ugly treatment meted out to me, he said, alluding to his dismissal as rural development minister following a disproportionate assets probe.        
	Now they are free to do anything. All of them have been given appropriate replies by the masses.        
	Earlier, while the results were yet to be declared officially, the buzz in Ranchi was the JMM would project deputy chief minister Sudhir Mahto for chief minister. Soren added his wife Rupis name to the list of contenders.        
	The RJD, however, rooted for Koda. Our party chief Lalu Prasad feels that Madhu Koda should be made chief minister again rather than putting the state under Presidents rule or allowing the communal NDA to form the government, a senior leader said.         
	Koda, sensing he was in with a chance again, made it clear he was not averse to accepting the job. I have always adhered to UPA directives, he said. Whatever the leadership will say, I am ready to follow.         
	State BJP chief P.N. Singh said: Soren should quit. It is the defeat of the UPA and the Congress should take responsibility.

          OUR BUREAU                              
	New Delhi, April 17: India is likely to receive near normal rainfall this year, weather scientists said today in their first monsoon forecast for 2009 that economists have dubbed a positive sign given the current economic slowdown.         
	The India Meteorological Department said the country is expected to receive 96 per cent of the long period average rainfall of 89cm during the four-month monsoon from June to September.         
	The IMD classifies rainfall between 96 per cent and 104 per cent of the average as near-normal. The long-range forecast uses statistical methods that link weather parameters involving land, ocean and air from different parts of the world to predict monsoon behaviour over India.         
	The IMD will issue a fresh forecast in June, which will also predict rainfall activity over the four geographical regions  the northwest, northeast, central India and the southern peninsular region.         
	Economists said the forecast increases the probability of good agricultural output and is likely to bring in positive sentiments at a time when growth has been projected at 6 per cent against an average of 9 per cent in the past three years.         
	If the rains are normal, it would boost rural demand and spur economic activity, said Subir Gokarn, the chief economist with the rating agency Standard and Poors. Had it not been a near-normal projection, it would have sent negative sentiments, forcing one to review the growth projections, Gokarn said.         
	The forecast looks good for agricultural output, said D.K. Joshi, the principal economist with the rating agency Crisil. Had the forecast been otherwise, it could have had an adverse impact on the economy and hit rural India which has so far been largely insulated from the economic slowdown, Joshi said.         
	The long range forecast methodology employed this year had proven itself last year when the IMD issued forecasts of 99 per cent in April and 100 per cent in June, while the actual overall rainfall was 98 per cent of the average.         
	Economists also caution that rainfall distribution over time will also determine the impact. Last year also, the Met department had forecast normal monsoon, but the third quarter agricultural production had dipped considerably, Joshi said.         
	The IMD will continue to observe distant weather parameters that can influence rainfall patterns over India, scientists said. One specific parameter they will look at involves sea surface temperatures in the eastern and western Indian Ocean regions, a factor called the Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD) which a Japanese research centre has predicted could turn negative during the second half of the year.         
	The prediction of the negative Indian Ocean Dipole from the Japan Agency for Marine Earth Science and Technology is a potential source of concern, a senior IMD scientist said, because negative Indian Ocean Dipoles in the past have been associated with reduced rainfall in the northern parts of India. The IOD has been steadily positive over the past two years  and India received good rainfall in both 2007 and 2008, the scientist said.         
	It is unclear whether the IOD will indeed turn negative, but if it does, there may be a slight impact on the rainfall over northern India during the second half of the season, the scientist said.         
	But scientists also point out while a positive Indian Ocean Dipole almost always translates into a good monsoon, a negative does not always mean reduced rainfall. Even with negative IOD, we can still have normal rainfall, said Sulochana Gadgil, a senior atmospheric scientist, formerly with the Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Mehsud killed by US drones: Pakistan
                                                                                                           Mehsud killed by US drones: Pakistan
          NASIR JAFFRY AND AGENCIES                            Baitullah Mehsud                                  
	Islamabad, Aug. 7: The chief of the Pakistani Taliban, Baitullah Mehsud, is believed to have died in Wednesdays US drone attack that also killed his wife and bodyguards, Islamabad said today.        
	According to my information and whatever intelligence reports I have, Mehsud has been killed in the strike, foreign minister Shah Mehmud Qureshi said in Islamabad.        
	However, he said, the authorities were carrying out ground verification so as to get 100 per cent confirmation.        
	A missile fired from a US drone hit the house of Mehsuds in-laws on Wednesday in the Zangra area of tribal South Waziristan, killing his wife, brother and seven bodyguards. Officials said Mehsud, the main target, was also in the house.        
	Yes, information is coming from that area that he (Mehsud) is dead, interior minister Rehman Malik said. I am unable to confirm unless I have solid evidence. He added that people were mourning in the settlement close to Makeen village, where Mehsud was tracked and targeted.        
	Sources said Mehsud, who had a $5 million bounty on his head and was accused of assassinating former Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto in 2007, had been quietly buried in Nigosa, 1km from the site of attack.        
	Reports from the Taliban warlords stronghold said a meeting of the Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan, which he led, was being held to elect a successor. The names of Waliur Rehman, Maulana Azmatullah, Qari Hussein and Hakimullah Mehsud, currently the outfits spokesman, are apparently being considered.        
	Taliban leaders presumed dead have sometimes resurfaced later and there were reports from other media quoting Taliban sources as saying that Mehsud was wounded and others saying he was dead. If Mehsud is indeed dead, regular Pakistani Taliban spokesmen are unlikely to confirm it until a new leader is chosen.

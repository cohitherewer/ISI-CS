                                                                                                           Rio does a Vaiko for Naga brethren
  - Nagaland chief minister speaks for his brothers in Myanmar           NISHIT DHOLABHAI                                     
	New Delhi, Aug. 19: What Vaiko is to Tamils in Sri Lanka, Nagaland chief minister Neiphiu Rio perhaps wants to be for the Nagas of Myanmar.        
	Rio today passionately put forth the interests of the Myanmar Nagas in front of the national media, disclosing that he has spoken not only to the ambassador of Myanmar but also to Prime Minister Manmohan Singh on the issue.        
	The chief minister also said his government would be happy to be privy to what transpires in the negotiation between the Centre and the National Socialist Council of Nagalim (Isak-Muivah).         
	Incidentally, by speaking of Myanmar Nagas, Rio is softly toeing the line of the NSCN (I-M) which has demanded integration of Naga inhabited areas  NSCN (I-M)s Nagalim also includes parts of Naga-inhabited areas of Myanmar.         
	I have taken up (the issue) with the Prime Minister, the home minister and am in touch with the Naga people in Myanmar, he told reporters today after a meeting with the Prime Minister on Tuesday.         
	Rio reminded of leaders in Tamil Nadu speaking up for fellow community members in neighbouring Sri Lanka.        
	The chief ministers new found love for the Nagas in Myanmar is the result of a state government-sponsored consultative meet of Naga diaspora to discuss an early solution to the Naga problem. One of the resolutions at the meet was to recognise the plight of Nagas in Myanmar.        
	In fact, his party was rechristened Naga Peoples Front from the earlier Nagaland Peoples Front in order to accord a pan-Naga identity to the regional party.         
	According to Rio, there are 600,000 Nagas in 254 villages in eastern Myanmar. These people are neglected in terms of education as well as healthcare, he said. The junta has no control and the administration visits these places just once a year.         
	Rio was, however, cautious in furthering the sensitive issue. We are not fighting for their integration, he said.        
	The chief minister has played his politics astutely, as he spoke of emotional integration on the one hand, and linked the NSCN (I-M) with Huji.         
	In his speech at the chief ministers conference, Rio said the NSCN (I-M) operatives from the Muslim community have been maintaining direct or indirect links with Muslim militant groups.         
	On Monday, both Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and home minister P. Chidambaram criticised Nagaland, along with Assam and Manipur, for a worsening situation. Rio said it was the Prime Ministers prerogative to criticise.

          OUR CORRESPONDENT                               
	Shillong, May 31: A round of fire in the air was all it took for seven undertrial prisoners, including serial rapists and murderers, to scare the guards and make their way out of Shillong jail this morning.        
	The seven, led by Full Moon Dhar, walked out of the jail at 7.20am after overpowering a guard at the second gate of the jail and without any resistance from other guards or the warders, raising suspicions that they escaped in connivance with the jail staff.        
	Shocked over the manner in which the undertrial prisoners walked free, the district administration ordered a magisterial inquiry into the incident even as the prison department instituted a separate departmental inquiry into the matter.         
	It was a regular daybreak at the jail when the prisoners spilled out of their cells for morning tea at 6.30am.        
	After having tea, seven  Dhar, Khrawborlang Marbaniang, Kharboklang Mawnai, Sankyntiewlang Decruse, Synsharilang Thongi, Ramu Thapa and Wanshailang Jana  assembled and crossed the first gate, which was open.         
	After emerging from the first gate, gang leader Dhar fired one round from his country-made pistol to scare the guards and make way for the escape.        
	The group then overpowered Bharat Singh, the guard at the second gate, and walked out.         
	The fact that the criminals managed to get a pistol inside the jail and the ease with which they escaped have led the police to surmise that it was a pre-planned operation.        
	The gang leader, 23-year-old Dhar, was chargesheeted early this year for raping and killing two women in September last year.        
	His partner in crime, 22-year-old Krawborlang Marbaniang, was one of the seven who escaped.        
	Dhar, Marbaniang and another friend, Micky Chester Suchiang murdered the two women by slitting their throats after a picnic at Ban Umtyngkhong on the outskirts of Shillong.         
	They were arrested within a few days.         
	Besides the twin murders, Dhar is involved in four rape cases and several murder and extortion cases, especially in Jaintia Hills.        
	In November last year, Dhar made an abortive attempt to escape from Shillong Civil Hospital cell.        
	He tried to remove the exhaust fan of a bathroom at the hospital but was caught thanks to alert policemen.         
	He had managed to smuggle in an iron cutter to cut the iron bar fixed to the exhaust fan. A woman had delivered the tool to him hidden in a thermos flask.         
	For todays escape, Dhar may have procured the pistol through close friends in connivance with some jail staff, the police believe.        
	Other undertrials who escaped today were chargesheeted for various crimes, including murder, car-lifting and highway robbery.         
	The additional director-general of police in-charge of prisons, Kulbir Krishan, said initial inquiry reveals that the criminals had planned the escape well in advance and they may got the assistance from inside. Narrating the manner in which the undertrials escaped, Krishan said after the morning tea for the prisoners, the warder posted at the first gate had gone to have tea himself and left the gate open.         
	The undertrials crossed the first gate and overpowered the guard at the second gate after firing one round in the air.         
	The head warder, Edward Wahlang, was absent from duty.         
	There were no security guards in the main gate leading to the city, which helped the criminals escape.         
	It appears that the criminals boarded a vehicle parked outside the jail, the East Khasi superintendent of police, L.B. Rapthap, said.         
	We suspect some foul play, as the head warder was absent and we are looking into all angles to get to the bottom of todays incident, Krishan said.         
	While the magisterial inquiry is in progress, headed by additional district magistrate M.R. Marak, the departmental probe is being headed by assistant inspector-general of prisons, Karmanik Hynniewta.

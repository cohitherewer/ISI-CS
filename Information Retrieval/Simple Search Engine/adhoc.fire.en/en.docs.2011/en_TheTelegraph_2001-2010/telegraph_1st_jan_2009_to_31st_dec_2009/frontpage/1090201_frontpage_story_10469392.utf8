          SAMBIT SAHA                               
	Jan. 31: A Citu-sponsored agitation pushed Haldia Petrochemicals to the brink of closure this evening but an unpublicised government intervention appears to have salvaged the situation for the time being.         
	Unrest returned to haunt Bengals showpiece industrial project from January 15 when a Citu-backed union renewed a demand to regularise 184 contract workers.         
	The agitation, launched with the blessings of CPM strongman and Tamluk MP Lakshman Seth, hampered a packaging process called bagging so much that the company was on the verge of shutting the plant this evening, sources told The Telegraph.         
	Once manufactured, polymer, the companys product, flows into silos and unless it is bagged, the grainy substance spills over. The management had formally told the union yesterday the plant would have to be shut as stocks could not be accommodated anymore.         
	But the agitators did not budge till this evening, after which the government intervened. The sources declined to name the persons who stepped in but in the past, the chief minister and the industries minister had used their influence to turn the union around.         
	Late this evening, some agitators decided to rejoin work with the claim that the management has agreed to consider their demand.         
	We have averted an immediate shutdown of the plant as of now but nothing could be said of tomorrow, a source in the management said.         
	The management will find it difficult to absorb the contract employees as the plant is highly mechanised and unskilled manpower cannot be used for other functions there, the source added.         
	The agitation came at a time the market for polymer, the key ingredient for making plastic, has entered a lean phase because of the economic slowdown. If existing obligations are not met, the company will have little leverage left with clients.         
	The protest affected construction for an expansion project called Supermax, which has already been delayed.         
	Besides, the agitators did not allow 35 trainee junior engineers to join the company in January. The Citu-affiliated HPL Employees Union had been seeking the regularisation of the employees for some time. But it added fresh demands  more casual workers on pay roll, accommodation and transport  in the run-up to the general election. Seth, blamed by many for lighting the Nandigram land spark, has been trying to show his clout at a time a section of the CPM has expressed reservations on fielding him again in Tamluk.         
	Asok Pattanaik, vice-president of the union, said 22 canteen workers stopped work yesterday as the company had failed to give them minimum wages, PF and ESI. Others stopped work as they did not get food from the canteen.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Get real, every star has a price
                                                                                                           Get real, every star has a price
          AMIT ROY                            Ronaldo: Brawn and booty                                 
	London, June 11: Cristiano Ronaldo has again left the football world open-mouthed with his footwork.        
	The news snap for one of soccers most dramatic stories in years came at 9.39am in London: Manchester United have confirmed they have accepted a world-record, unconditional offer of 80 million for Cristiano Ronaldo from Real Madrid.        
	That the Spanish club was wooing Ronaldo, chosen the worlds best player by Fifa last year, was known. But not too many people expected Real to break the bank again for the Portuguese winger just two days after signing Brazilian midfielder Kaka at a then-record 56 million.        
	For 80million (Rs 620 crore), you can buy 1.31 million Apple iPhones, make nearly four trips to the International Space Station and back, or own four-fifths of Newcastle United, the relegated Premier League club for which Michael Owen plays.        
	Or you can buy 85 Kevin Pietersens, the Indian Premier Leagues most expensive player  which means one Ronaldo is worth almost a whole IPL of eight teams each with 11 Pietersens.        
	The question being asked today was whether any sportsman, however gifted, was really worth that much. European football boss Michel Platini called the price excessive at a time of recession, and Real president Florentino Perezs move was pilloried in Spain, where the 18.1 per cent unemployment rate is the continents highest.        
	For United, selling the 24-year-old genius is a bit like India selling Sachin Tendulkar in his prime. Perhaps Ronaldos petulance and pouting, and repeated threats of leaving, finally persuaded Alex Ferguson it was better to let him go. Some United fans were downcast but others said it was good riddance since the speculation about Ronaldos future was unsettling the other players.        
	There was speculation that United, whose parent company Red Footballs debts are in the region of 650 million, had agreed to take the transfer proceeds in instalments and that Ronaldo would receive 60m over the five years of his contract (at Rs 93 crore a year).        
	A United statement suggested the move came at the request of Cristiano - who has again expressed his desire to leave.        
	The deal is yet to be inked, but a Real statement said: The club hope to reach an agreement with the player in the next few days. Perezs Real is now the author of the top four costliest signings in history, including those of Frenchman Zinedine Zidane for 45.6m (2001) and Portuguese Luis Figo for 37m (2000).        
	Tommy Docherty, a former United manager, said the Ronaldo deal had more to do with business than with sport. I think its fantastic business. It was 40 million, it was 50 million, it was 60, now its 80. And I sit at home giggling when managers say, he is not available at any price, and a fortnight later he is gone. Every player has a price.        
	A top agent, Barry Silkman, believes the worlds top three footballers cannot be priced the way others can. A club will pay 15-16million for what Id call a good Premier League player but for one of the top three, there is no value, Silkman said.        
	If you said to someone they had to pay 100 quid to watch a player, who would you watch? You would watch a team that included Ronaldo, Messi or Kaka. These guys are in a different league. They dont just win games on their own, they excite the crowd, people from all over the world want to see them.

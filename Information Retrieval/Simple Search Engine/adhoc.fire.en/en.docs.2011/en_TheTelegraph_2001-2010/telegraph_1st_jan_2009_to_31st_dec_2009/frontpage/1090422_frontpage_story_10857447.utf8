  Bihar contrary pulls explode          SANKARSHAN THAKUR                            Lalu Prasad, Pranab Mukherjee                                            
	Patna, April 21: A day after Lalu Prasad attempted to put the brakes on plunging RJD-Congress ties with strong advocacy of Manmohan Singh as the next Prime Minister, the fast-changing ground dynamics in Bihar dragged relations to the brink again.        
	Acting on a brief from local partymen that Lalu Prasads star was on the wane, external affairs minister and Congress veteran, Pranab Mukherjee, took his gloves off at Samastipur this afternoon and delivered his most trusted UPA ally a punch in the nose.        
	Lalu will not be part of the next government, Mukherjee said, unusually unequivocal in tone. He has betrayed us and used us like a doormat.        
	Lalu Prasad responded quickly and in equal measure. The UPA is not the Congresss alone, it is a coalition and we -- Lalu, Ram Vilas Paswan and Mulayam Singh -- are all part of it. The Congress cannot form a government at the Centre without us, if they have illusions about that, we shall see once the results come.        
	The reasons for Lalu Prasads blow-hot-blow-cold on the Congress are not far to seek. He is working under contrary pulls and pressures. At the national level, an alliance with the Congress is his only hope of survival on the political stage. But in Bihar, his candidates are under pressure almost everywhere from Congress nominees cutting into critical Muslim votes.        
	As one senior RJD leader put his dilemma: Laluji knows the Congress is the only party that can keep him afloat with a ministerial berth in Delhi, but everywhere he goes in Bihar, his candidates tell him the Congress is the biggest thorn in their side, he has to attack them.        
	It may be a little early to pronounce the death of the RJD-Congress alliance. It may be a little early to pronounce the death of the RJD-Congress alliance  the door is still open for a rapprochement. Lalu Prasad and Mukherjee spoke later in the evening to clear the air and reassure each other that their statements were misconstrued or misunderstood.        
	But some analysts are putting a radical interpretation on the unfolding events --- an incipient alliance between the Congress and Nitish Kumars JD(U), widely expected to turn the tables on Lalu Prasad in these elections. Nitish runs a coalition with the BJP in the state and is an intrinsic part of the NDA. But the possibility of him doing a Navin Patnaik cannot entirely be ruled out, even if it is to be at the expense of Nitish having to lose his government and face fresh elections.         
	He has already established a record for governance in Bihar, admitted a senior RJD MP, and he has the support of a cross-section of voters , including the minorities, at the state level, he may not be shy of facing voters ahead of the end of his term.         
	Nitish himself has remained cleverly cryptic on his post-poll moves. He has asserted his commitment to the NDA but also said nobody knows about tomorrow. His think-tank, meantime, has been subtly hinting at a possible break with the BJP in case it is not in a position to form the next government. It is significant that Nitish has kept his secular credentials totally pure and intact, said one pointedly. His politics are only unfolding, watch him.        
	A Nitish-Congress alliance may seem a long-shot at the moment, but nobody in Bihar is ruling it out, even if it does not happen immediately after the results are in mid-May. The Congress, increasingly convinced Nitish will bag the greater kitty in Bihar at the cost of the Lalu-Paswan combine, is itself probably hinting at it. It is unlikely Mukherjee spoke out of turn today, or without a nod from Sonia Gandhi.        
	The rally that Mukherjee addressed at Samastipur was originally meant to have starred Sonia; Congress sources indicated that she pulled out last-minute and pressed Mukherjee into service in order to send a blunt message to Lalu Prasad.        
	Sonia herself --- and Prime Minister Manmohan Singh --- are keeping clear of confronting the RJD chief personally at the moment. This could be a tactical ploy to keep possibilities of a post-poll rapprochement open. It is perhaps significant, in this regard, that Singh was gently forgiving of Lalu Prasads earlier attacks on the Congress in an interview to a television channel today. We do not take Lalujis statements seriously, we are a coalition and partners criticise each other during election time, the Prime Minister said.        
	Lalu Prasad, too, kept the possibilities of a patch-up with the Congress open, telling the gathered media at his 10 Circular Road residence: Dont make too much of this, you will see in the end all secular forces will form a government together.         
	But there was a significant shift in his position on prime minsitership. In an exclusive interview to The Telegraph yesterday, Lalu had said he and his partners were embattled to reinstall Manmohan Singh as Prime Minister. Today, he made a subtle shift and said the Prime Minister would be picket by UPA partners after the elections.         
	Lalu retracted none of what he had told The Telegraph yesterday, but Mukherjees unexpected assault today left him with no option other than issuing a strong retort.

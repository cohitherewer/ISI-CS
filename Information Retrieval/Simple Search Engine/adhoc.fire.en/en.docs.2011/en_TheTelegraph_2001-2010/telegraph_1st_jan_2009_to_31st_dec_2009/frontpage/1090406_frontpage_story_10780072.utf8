The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | JMM finds Soren void hard to fill
                                                                                                           JMM finds Soren void hard to fill
  - Party admits difficulties even in sitting seats of Rajmahal, Jamshedpur          SUMAN K. SHRIVASTAVA                                     
	Ranchi, April 5: At the intensive care unit of Apollo Hospital, New Delhi, Shibu Soren is fighting for life. On the election battlefield, the JMM, too, is struggling hard to survive the odds it never witnessed since its inception 38 years ago.        
	With just 10 days to go before the first vote is cast in the state, the party has already started feeling the void created by the absence of its supreme leader  a huge draw by himself  during election campaigns.        
	Soren, ailing for the past two months, was admitted to Apollo with acute septicaemia, a life-threatening infection, on Friday. We will have difficulty even in the sitting seats if Guruji is not campaigning for them, particularly in Rajmahal, Jamshedpur and Giridih, admitted a JMM functionary, requesting anonymity.         
	Sorens eldest son Durgas rebellion  he has thrown his hat in the ring in Godda  has made the crisis all the more severe. Durgas action has brought to the fore that an alternative centre of power is emerging within the JMM camp. It may put other party leaders at a great discomfort, pointed out a senior JMM leader, who did not want to be named.        
	Durga claimed today that he was the official candidate of the JMM. But Durgas nomination is set to be turned down after scrutiny tomorrow. After Sorens rejection, Durga cannot be treated as an Independent either, as he needs at least 10 electorate to propose his candidature as an independent nominee, he added.        
	However, Gurujis absence may not have much impact on his prospects in Dumka. Soren enjoys a sort of captive vote bank in Dumka, who will not shift their loyalty, said Harishwar Dayal, who studied the 2004 elections on behalf of the Centre for Studying Developing Societies.         
	Dayal added that the JMM influence was traditionally limited to Santhal Pargana. Sorens absence might not hit the prospects of the Congress, which is contesting nine out of the 14 seats under seat-sharing deal with the JMM, he added.         
	In fact, his absence may work in advantage for the Congress. We expected that the Congress will go solo in this election on the Bihar pattern consolidating its presence among minority voters  both Muslims and tribal Christians. But it belied any logic as to why it had signed a deal with the JMM and invite anti-incumbency factor, he added.              
	Political pundits said that the weakening of JMM might only catapult Babulal Marandi to the centre stage. Since the BJP has no strong base in the Santhal Pargana, Babulal will fill up the vacuum, said one of the political observers.        
	In fact, Babulals rise in the BJP hinged on his feat to defeat Shibu Soren in Dumka in 1998 and his wife subsequently in 1999. Babulal-led JVM bets on at least three seats  Koderma, Godda and Palamau. If the projections come true, it would have a cascading impact on the Assembly elections catapulting the JVM to emerge stronger and fill up the space of a regional party, said JVM campaign manager Deepak Prakash.         
	Also, once Soren gets weaker it is expected that the power struggle within the JMM, between the leaders of tribals and Kurmi caste, who form a firm support base of the party, would only get stronger. This struggle would further be vitiated by Sorens ambitious sons  Durga and Hemant. In the past three decades, Soren  who was first elected to Parliament in 1980  has not nurtured a second line of command. Stephen Marandi would have taken over the command, but he left the party because of the over-ambitious sons.         
	The Congress leaders put up a brave face, saying Sorens absence would have no impact on their poll prospects. The problem with the JMM is that Soren was not able to transfer their vote to the Congress while the Congress votes were cast for the JMM.         
	The records show that the JMM had always enjoyed advantage when it fought elections in alliance. In 1991, Janata Dal and JMM had an electoral alliance, winning eight seats (JMM got six). In 1998, the Congress, RJD and JMM had an alliance, which won two seats, both by the Congress. In 1999, the RJD and the Congress had an electoral alliance, which won three seats, two by the Congress. In 2004, the Congress had an alliance with the JMM, RJD and CPI in which JMM won four seats.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | When in doubt, dump   Govt shelves IT project

  Govt shelves IT project          OUR BUREAU                                                    
	Calcutta, Sept. 7: The Bengal government has shelved the information technology township meant to showcase Infosys and Wipro, the project falling prey to the Vedic Village controversy and the post-Singur atmosphere in which political expediency has paid rich dividends.        
	The IT department cannot proceed with the project slated to come up in and around Rajarhat, a statement issued by the ministry headed by Debesh Das said today.        
	At this moment, we are unable to stick to our assurances of providing land to Wipro and Infosys and, thereby, constrained to inform them about the governments inability, the statement added.         
	Wipro and Infosys had been promised 90 acres each in the 1,200-acre complex that was being planned as a joint venture among the state-run Webel; Raj Modi, the jailed promoter of Vedic Village; and Amarnath Shroff of Diamond Group, a real estate investor.        
	The IT township has no direct link with the resort but the flare-up in Vedic Village after a football brawl and the resultant storm had brought the joint venture also under the scanner, fuelling charges of land purchase by the private partner at gunpoint.        
	Infosys, which had soft-pedalled the project after the economic slowdown, said: Its a rather unfortunate incident. The government should take initiatives to acquire land.        
	Wipro, for which the government said 50 of the 90 acres were ready, said: We do expect and hope that the government is able to allocate suitable land to build the facility.        
	The abandonment of the project was more or less certain after the CPM state secretariat made the recommendation on Friday. CPM state secretary Biman Bose, who returned from Delhi last night, had apparently got the approval of the politburo, too, for halting the project.        
	The private promoters were supposed to give the government 600 acres free in exchange for building infrastructure facilities in the entire 1,200-acre complex. The government would have given land to Infosys and Wipro from the 600 acres, leaving the rest to build a township.        
	It is also impossible for the IT department to proceed with the project if any of the six departments refuses to facilitate, todays statement said, suggesting that the IT wing alone was not behind the decision and possibly hinting at misgivings about the haste.        
	Industries minister Nirupam Sen, said to be opposed to hasty action that would make it impossible to get job-creating infotech giants to invest in the state, asked this evening in despondence: How does my opinion matter?        
	CPM state secretariat member Benoy Konar said: Its a retreat for the government. It will send a wrong message.        
	The announcement of the burial of the IT project came a day before Trinamul Congress chief Mamata Banerjee addresses a meeting in Rajarhat on the forcible land acquisition. Mamata has been uncharacteristically muted on the Vedic Village controversy till now amid charges that the Trinamul leadership was also close to land sharks.        
	Attention has so far been focused on Abdur Rezzak Mollah, the land minister and a vocal critic of the chief ministers policy to acquire land for industry, and his departments out-of-court settlement with the Vedic Village promoter.        
	Mollahs department had issued an order on December 11, 2008, allowing the IT project and its constituents to hold land in excess of the ceiling, according to the IT department statement that also spoke of cabinet clearance. Mollah has been seeking the scrapping of the project.        
	Todays statement by the IT department appeared to put up in principle a credible case.        
	Pointing out that the governments repeated attempts to find land for the IT giants had run into rough weather, the note cited several initiatives that fell through.        
	When the government failed to provide land and accommodate IT companies, a private company on its own initiative contacted Infosys and offered them land in the area. Infosys visited the area a number of times and agreed to take the land and come here, provided the government was involved in the project, the statement said.        
	The statement added that the finance department had set a condition that money to be spent on infrastructure creation should not exceed the amount to be realised by selling land to IT majors.         
	However, in the end, the nightmare of Singur seems to have forced the government to dump the project and cut its political losses.

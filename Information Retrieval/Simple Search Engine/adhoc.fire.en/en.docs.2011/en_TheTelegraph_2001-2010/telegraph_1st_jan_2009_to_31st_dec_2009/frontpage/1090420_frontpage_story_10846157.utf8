The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Shot? Its her cup of tea
                                                                                                           Shot? Its her cup of tea
                            
	London, April 19: An American woman who was shot in the head by her husband not only survived but made herself a cup of tea.         
	Police and doctors hailed the survival of Tammy Sexton, 47, as miraculous after a bullet from a handgun struck her squarely in the forehead, passed through her skull and exited through the back of her head. She is expected to make a full recovery, while her husband shot himself dead after the attack on his wife.        
	But law enforcement officers in Jackson County, Mississippi, were also astonished that Sexton offered them tea when they arrived at her home after the shooting.        
	Sheriff Mike Byrd said: When the officer got there she said, Whats going on? She was holding a rag on her head and talking. She was conscious, but she was confused about what had happened.        
	She had made herself some tea and offered the officer something to drink. Theres no way she should be alive other than a miracle from God.        
	He said her husband had been on probation for domestic violence and officers had been seeking to serve him with a court order demanding he stayed away from his wife and their rural home.        
	He said the bullet apparently passed through the lobes of the womans brain without causing major damage. She was rushed to hospital by helicopter where she has been monitored for three days.        
	Dr Patrick Pritchard, an assistant professor of surgery at the University of Alabama-Birmingham, said: There is a space in the brain where a missile could pass without doing any major damage.         
	Is it possible? Yes. It would be rare.                     THE SUNDAY TELEGRAPH

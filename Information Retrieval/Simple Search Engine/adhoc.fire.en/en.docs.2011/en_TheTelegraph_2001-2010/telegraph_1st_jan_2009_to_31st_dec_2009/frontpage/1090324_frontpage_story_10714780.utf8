The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Curbs on MPA agitation
                                                                                                           Curbs on MPA agitation
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Shillong, March 23: The East Khasi Hills administration has prohibited the holding of any agitation by the Meghalaya Progressive Alliance in the district in protest against Presidents rule with immediate effect.        
	The MPA and its supporters, however, said they would go ahead with the proposed agitation scheduled for Saturday.        
	Promulgating an order under Section 144 CrPC, East Khasi Hills deputy commissioner B. Dhar told reporters today that the proposed agitation could lead to law and order problems since the Election Commission had issued a notification for the first phase of elections on April 16 and the election code of conduct has become operative.         
	If the NGOs and political parties start any agitation at this juncture, they will be charged with the same yardstick. We cannot allow you one inch, Dhar said.         
	MPA secretary Conrad Sangma said their agitation would not create any law and order problem as we are going for a peaceful rally without carrying any arms and ammunition.         
	NCP leader P.A. Sangma has also decided to hold a hunger strike in Delhi from Wednesday. Conrad said though his father was adamant on going ahead with the hunger strike in Delhi, the party wanted him to resort to other forms of agitation in the Northeast on health grounds.         
	Adding to the machinations in the state vis--vis Presidents rule, the Congress today intensified efforts to woo the United Democratic Party legislators to form the next government in Meghalaya.         
	Confirming this, senior Congress leader Charles Pyngrope said the UDP was inclined to tie up with the Congress so that there was a stable government as the state was already under Presidents rule. However, UDP leaders today denied such a move and added that it was not possible in the present context where the party was a coalition partner in the MPA.         
	Some party insiders said it was the ploy of the Congress which had compelled UDP legislator Ampareen Lyngdoh to write to party president Donkupar Roy that she would not be party to the proposed agitation against Presidents rule.         
	Lyngdoh, in her letter addressed to Roy last night, accused another MPA partner and Independent legislator Manas Chaudhuri, of threatening her as she had opposed any sort of agitation against Presidents rule since it could create law and order problems in the state.         
	Chaudhuri denied threatening her but said the issue was discussed over phone.         
	A senior UDP leader, reiterating support to the MPA on condition of anonymity, said Lyngdoh, a former Youth Congress leader, was actingbeing influenced by the Congress.                                             
	According to the UDP leader, targeting Chaudhuri was to divert attention and it is an attempt on the part of her to join the Congress fold.         
	There are reports that since Lyngdoh may be pitted against Speaker Bindo Lanong under the delimited constituency of Malki-Laitumkhrah in 2013, she is not averse to the idea of quitting the UDP to join the Congress.         
	In her letter addressed to Roy, Lyngdoh did not directly mention that the UDP should tie up with the Congress to form an alternative government, but the text of the letter hinted at this.         
	We, at this crossroad of political instability, must rise to the occasion and take necessary decisions to achieve an envisioned bargain for political strength, she said.         
	Talking over phone from Delhi, the AICC general secretary in charge of Northeast, Luizinho Feliero said many UDP legislators were keen to come to the Congress fold for an alternate government.         
	If P.A. Sangma had earlier expressed the partys desire to merge with us, the UDP is also free to join a Congress-led government and the move is on, Feliero said.         
	He also indicated the exodus of legislators from the MPA would ensure the formation of a Congress-led government.        
	Hearing deferred: The Shillong bench of Gauhati High Court today deferred the hearing on the petitions filed by the three Meghalaya legislators against their interim disqualification by Speaker Bindo Lanong.         
	Advocate S.P. Mahanta, who filed the petitions on their behalf, said the petition of Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) legislator and Deputy Speaker Sanbor Shullai would be taken up on Wednesday. The hearing on the petitions of Adviser Pariong of the Hill State Peoples Democratic Party (HSPDP) and Independent Ismail Marak, who is also an associate member of the United Democratic Party (UDP), would be held on Friday, Mahanta said.        
	There was a hearing today but it could not be concluded as the complainants had sought more time, Mahanta said.         
	Independent legislator Manas Chaudhuri, who is camping in Delhi, said the MPAs lawyer Amit Kumar had filed a writ petition in the Supreme Court today against the imposition of Presidents rule.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Narcissistic CPM leadership should step down, says Somnath
                                                                                                           Narcissistic CPM leadership should step down, says Somnath
          JAYANTH JACOB                               Karat at a news conference in Delhi on Saturday, Chatterjee. (PTI, file picture)				                                 
	New Delhi, May 16: Somnath Chatterjee, who was expelled by the CPM for refusing to step down as Speaker, today said the narcissistic CPM leadership should step down in the wake of the poll debacle.        
	Asked about the CPMs performance in Bengal, Chatterjee said: If he (Prakash Karat) has a conscience, he should consider it (stepping down. But, soon enough, Chatterjee added that he was speaking of the leadership in general.        
	Speaking at his house, Chatterjees mood swung from despondency  that many of his Bengal comrade friends lost the elections  to gratification  that he conducted the House without any fear or favour  to virulent  when it came to the CPM leadership.         
	 Time has to come to take a new look at the leadership, Chatterjee said, adding that he was not a party member now. But there was a rider: he didnt leave the party, and will never apply to re-enter.        
	He blamed the leadership for stressing on self-importance, being imperious and obsessed with its own importance in Indian politics.        
	The leadership has to be mature, ground-oriented, and reality-based. Its a very serious situation, Chatterjee said.        
	He lambasted the CPM leadership for their efforts to cobble up a third front on a negative plank. What was the use of a third platform without putting policies and programmes in place? It was a negative approach. Has it helped the Left any way? The leadership should introspect, he said.        
	At the same time, Chatterjee added that the Bengal government has had good policies and programmes within many constraints of the federal system in the country.         
	Chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee had recently said that he missed Somnathda and was trying in his own way to bring him back into the party fold.        
	Chatterjee today said he believed that the CPM leadership still failed to foresee and stem a rout.        
	Chatterjees subsequent references made it clear that by leadership he meant the party central command in Delhi, not those at the helm in Calcutta. He blamed the leadership for turning against the UPA citing the nuclear deal and failing to make it an election issue.        
	I never espoused the nuclear deal. I didnt study it in great detail to either support it or oppose it. But the CPM didnt even make it a poll issue, and, of course, I am saying it based on the newspaper reports about the election campaign.        
	What about the loss of his former colleagues from Bengal? Hannan (Mollah) lost, Rupchand (Pal) lost. The party even lost in Purulia. Its unbelievable. Once a person got a CPM nomination from seats like these, his or her victory was ensured. But look at what has happened. This situation didnt happen even in 1984. The party has to introspect about it.         
	What about Mamata Banerjee, who had made her electoral debut by defeating Chatterjee in 1984, pulling off her most stunning coup yet just when he appeared to be preparing for his political retirement?        
	Its the peoples mandate, so she deserves congratulations. Then she drove out the Nano, stifled industry, then went on to win the election! The party has to introspect about this defeat, he said.         
	Any chance of his joining a political party now? I havent left the party (CPM), Chatterjee said, adding in jest: My wife told me she will divorce me if I join a political party.        
	Then as an afterthought, he added: You should write about this. The Indian politician does retire.

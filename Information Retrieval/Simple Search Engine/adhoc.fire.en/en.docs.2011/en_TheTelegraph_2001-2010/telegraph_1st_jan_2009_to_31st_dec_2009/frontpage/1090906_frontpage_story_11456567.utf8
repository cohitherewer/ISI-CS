                                Jack Tweed                            
	London, Sept. 5: A court in East London today remanded Jack Tweed, the widower of Celebrity Big Brother star Jade Goody, in judicial custody on the charge of rape.        
	The 22-year-old, who wore a blue hooded top, spoke only to confirm his name, date of birth and address at the court.         
	He was remanded in custody until September 21.         
	Tweed, 22, was arrested at his home in East London yesterday after a young woman, who is in her late teens, made a complaint to police.         
	The court heard that the alleged offence took place at Tweeds residence in the early hours of Friday.         
	Several of Tweeds relatives and friends were in court to see him in the dock.         
	Tweeds mother, Mary, and younger brother left the court without commenting.         
	Another man in his 20s has been bailed pending further inquiries.         
	Tweed has never been far from the headlines since his wife died in March this year.         
	He married Goody shortly before her death from cervical cancer at the age of 27.         
	He has spoken widely about how he has struggled to come to terms with her death and admitted turning to alcohol to ease the pain.         
	Tweeds spokesperson, Mark Thomas, declined to comment on the arrest.         
	Officers investigating the rape allegation have also arrested a third man aged 25 yesterday, the police said.         
	The woman made the allegation after apparently meeting the men at a central London club on Thursday night.                     THE DAILY TELEGRAPH

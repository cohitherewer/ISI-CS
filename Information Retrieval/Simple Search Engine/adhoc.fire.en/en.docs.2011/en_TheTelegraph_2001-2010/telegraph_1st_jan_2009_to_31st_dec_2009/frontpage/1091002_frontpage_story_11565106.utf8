          BARUN GHOSH                               
	Calcutta, Oct. 1: The Congress has finally sent out a stern message to Mamata Banerjee: the party will no longer work on terms set by the Trinamul Congress chief.         
	It was left to Congress MP from Raiganj Deepa Das Munshi to call Mamatas bluff. For Das Munshi, the battle in Siliguri had both a local and a larger dimension.        
	North Bengal is the Congresss last fort in Bengal: Mamata has already taken over the Opposition space in the rest of the state. Conceding Siliguri to Trinamul would have meant inviting Mamata to the Congresss and Das Munshis own backyard.        
	Unlike in the Lok Sabha and in the bypolls to Sealdah and Bowbazar Assembly seats, Das Munshi could persuade the party high command that she should be allowed to enforce her writ against Mamata.        
	Since the day the Siliguri poll results were announced on September 15 opening up possibilities for the Congress, she has been in constant touch with senior party leaders.         
	I have been regularly giving an update to both Pranabda (Mukherjee, Bengal Congress president) and Raoji (K. Keshava Rao, AICC general secretary, in charge of Bengal affairs) for over a fortnight. Even this morning, I informed them after the Left backing. They okayed my initiative, she said.         
	The MP also argued that the Siliguri episode would make Congress supporters realise that the party should maintain the alliance with Trinamul but not by sacrificing their own self-respect.         
	Going by Das Munshis statements, it appears that though the high command had publicly said it had left the Siliguri battle to be resolved by local leaders, it stood by Das Munshi to keep Trinamul at bay.        
	The Congresss defiance of Mamata in Siliguri may not necessarily be the beginning of the end of the alliance that it had struck with Trinamul before the Lok Sabha elections in May.         
	But the partys new found boldness, especially its decision to take the Lefts help, has the potential to add new dimensions to Bengals politics in the near future. Mamata has alleged that the Congress has betrayed the people of Siliguri by taking the Lefts help.For the Lok Sabha elections, the Congress had to give in to the 28-14 seat sharing demand of Mamata followed by withdrawal of candidates from the Bowbazar and Sealdah seats in the Assembly bypolls. A surrender in Siliguri would have meant that the Congress would have lost its bargaining power when 82 municipalities, including the Calcutta Municipal Corporation, go to polls next year and in the 2011 Assembly elections.

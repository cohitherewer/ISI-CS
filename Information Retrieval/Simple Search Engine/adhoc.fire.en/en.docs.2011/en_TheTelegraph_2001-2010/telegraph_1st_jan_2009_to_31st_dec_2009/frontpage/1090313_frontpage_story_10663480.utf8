          SUJAN DUTTA AND JAYANTH JACOB                               
	New Delhi, March 12: Pakistan is a country at war with itself and even army rule cannot create a power centre that Delhi can talk to, inputs that went to a high-level meeting to draft a short-term response to the neighbour have suggested.         
	The short-notice meeting of the cabinet committee on security was called by Prime Minister Manmohan Singh at his 7 Race Course Road residence today.        
	The meeting followed reports that the regime in Islamabad was tottering after Pakistans army chief, General Ashfaq Parvez Kayani, met Prime Minister Yousaf Raza Gilani. Over last night and this morning, there has been a clampdown on protesters and police are arresting lawyers on a long march to Islamabad. ( )        
	Right now, it is the army versus Zardari; Zardari versus Gilani; Gilani versus Sharif and Zardari. Nawaz Sharifs political stock is improving but he has never been the best of friends with the army, an officer in the Indian security establishment said.        
	Then there are the Taliban forces trying to carve out their own territories. Actually, it is everyone for himself, leaving us in New Delhi not knowing who to talk to and who to listen to, he said.         
	The officer did not mention the US, which announced millions of dollars in military aid to Pakistan that total just about Rs 15,000 crore short of the defence allocation of Rs 1.40 lakh crore for Indias armed forces.        
	In public, Indian foreign minister Pranab Mukherjee said he expected Pakistan to sort itself out.         
	The immediate concern for India is that there will not even be a de jure power centre to deal with.        
	One of the drafts that went up to the cabinet committee on security, at which national security adviser M.K. Narayanan presented a paper, said Zardari, Sharif, the ISI and the army were contenders for power. As were different groups of the Taliban in Swat and Waziristan. Former dictator Pervez Musharraf is also seen as a contender though he has ruled himself out of a race.        
	India is watching if Kayani will engineer a coup that will lead to army rule directly or whether he will foist a civilian leader, like General Moeen did in Bangladesh with a civilian chief adviser before he allowed elections in December 2008 after 23 months of effective army rule.        
	The crisis in Pakistan runs so deep now, said an official, that even whipping up anti-India hysteria may not unite the forces within its elite.

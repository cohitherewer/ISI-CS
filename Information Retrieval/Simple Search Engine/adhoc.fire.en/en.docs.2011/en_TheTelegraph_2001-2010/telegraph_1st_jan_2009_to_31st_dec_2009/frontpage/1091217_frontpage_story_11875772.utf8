  - Hundreds lay siege to Dhaniram institute, probe begins          A STAFF REPORTER                                           
	Guwahati, Dec. 16: Hundreds of people today laid siege to the police outpost in Sonapur, on the outskirts of the city, demanding the arrest of pig heart surgeon Dhaniram Baruah whom they held responsible for the murder of six persons in the area.         
	The bodies, including that of four minors, were found at their house in Jogdol village, 100 metres from the Heart City and City of Human Genome owned by Baruah, on Sunday morning. The heads of two boys were severed.        
	The protesters held placards reading, Arrest Dhaniram Baruah, Dhaniram Baruah go back, Dhaniram Baruah is a killer.         
	Senior police officials, including additional superintendent of police (city) Longnit Terang and deputy superintendent of police (Dispur) Nabanit Mahanta, rushed to the spot to defuse the tension.         
	The siege continued for more than an hour. The protesters dispersed after the police assured them that the guilty would not be spared.         
	The villagers marched to the police outpost from Karchia Primary School after holding a public meeting on the schools premises to demand Baruahs arrest and condemn the killings. The residents expressed dissatisfaction over the slow pace of police probe into the murders.         
	Some of them alleged that the police had not even checked the institutes premises for clues after a police dog sniffed the trail of a severed head to its boundary wall.         
	We suspect Baruahs hand. He might have committed the murders for some medical experiment. Strange things happen at his institute which has around 400 dogs and a large number of pigs, goats and rabbits on whom he performs experiments and research, Sapan Boro, a resident, alleged.         
	Baruah should be arrested and his institute shifted out of the area. Some foul play is going on at the institute. Why else is he so secretive about his research and does not allow anybody inside the campus? the secretary of All Tiwa Students Union, Cheni Ram Timung, said. He also accused Baruah of setting up the institute by encroaching on tribal land.         
	Another resident, Sadhana Doley, said they would obstruct people from going to Baruahs institute as part of a social boycott. Not even his employees will be allowed to enter the campus.         
	She said one of the victims, Sapna, used to do odd jobs at the institute. Sapna might have come to know something which Baruah wanted to hide from the world and, as a result, he may have killed her, along with her family members, she alleged, adding that the police should probe this angle.         
	The police said investigations were on and they had gathered some clues.         
	We cant reveal anything at this juncture as we are yet to ascertain the motive behind the murders. We have also not received any substantial evidence of Baruahs role in the murders yet. We cant arrest anybody merely on the basis of allegations, a police officer said.         
	Police said they would question Baruah in connection with the allegations levelled against him.        
	Baruah, who was in Bangalore, returned to Guwahati this evening and is being interrogated by police.         
	The local people threatened to take the law into their hands if the police failed to act soon.         
	Yesterday, a mob had damaged the institutes property, alleging Baruahs role in the murders.         
	The mob went on the rampage after a stray dog brought in the severed heads of two boys at Jogdol yesterday. The victims were Harakanta Doley, 45, his wife Sapna, 40, daughters Sabita, 12, and Punita, 11, son Atul, 9, and nephew Tukul, 6.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                               
	New Delhi, June 8: Prime Minister Manmohan Singh has despatched a fresh missive to his team, reminding each of governance objectives and telling cabinet ministers to allocate adequate work to their juniors.        
	Junior ministers, especially those manning infrastructure and social sector departments, are being sent separate letters from Singh emphasising the need for cohesive and target-oriented functioning.        
	Part of the advice Singh is giving his team is not to air intra- or inter-ministerial differences on policy matters, and to concentrate on the work at hand instead.        
	Last week, Singh had issued a public directive to finance minister Pranab Mukherjee to ensure that the budget adequately and appropriately reflected the priorities and programmes outlined in the Presidents address. Todays move, too, is being seen as part of the Prime Ministers bid to align his team to the tasks he has set his government.        
	It is clear that Singh wants all hands on deck to have a role and play their part in making his a performance-oriented dispensation.         
	An impression had gone round  justifiably in many cases  that junior ministers were no more than political sops to allies or to Congress factions, that they were meant merely to decorate their offices and enjoy the perks.        
	The directive on junior ministers also puts the focus on Mamata Banerjees half-a- dozen ministers of state, four of whom are in the social sector/infrastructure bracket. Mamatas diktat to them that they should spend five days a week in Bengal might run right in the face of the expectations that the Prime Minister has now laid on them.        
	Several junior ministers in the last government had complained about not being allocated enough meaningful work by their seniors. That trend, the Prime Minister wants to be a thing of the past.        
	Singh believes that several of those inducted at the junior level are not merely filling up ministerial quotas but bringing genuine talent.         
	Among the new young ministers being flagged as potential performers are Shashi Tharoor (external affairs), Pradeep Jain (rural development), Agatha Sangma (rural development), R.P.N. Singh (road transport and highways), Sachin Pilot (communications and IT) and Bharat Solanki (power).

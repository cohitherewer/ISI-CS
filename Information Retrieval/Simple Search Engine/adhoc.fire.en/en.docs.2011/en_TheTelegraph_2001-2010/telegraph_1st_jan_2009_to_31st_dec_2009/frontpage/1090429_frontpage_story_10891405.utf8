The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Sweden minister denied Lanka visa
                                                                                                           Sweden minister denied Lanka visa
          THOMAS FULLER                        Swedish foreign minister Carl Bildt. (AFP)				                                 
	Colombo, April 28: Increasingly impatient with foreign calls for a pause in its war against Tamil rebels, the Sri Lankan government denied entry to the Swedish foreign minister who had planned to take part in a EU humanitarian mission, Sweden said today.        
	Sweden said it would recall its chief diplomat in Sri Lanka.        
	Carl Bildt, a former Prime Minister and now the countrys foreign minister, told reporters in Luxembourg that his visa application was turned down by Colombo and accused the Sri Lankan government of exceedingly strange behaviour.         
	You just dont act this way, Bildt was quoted as saying by The Associated Press.         
	Two other European officials, Britains foreign secretary, David Miliband, and the French foreign minister, Bernard Kouchner, will carry out the mission as planned, Bildt said.        
	As the Sri Lankan military closes in on Tamil Tiger rebels who are holding an estimated 50,000 civilians as human shields, the government here has become increasingly sensitive to foreign criticism of the war. A commentary in the pro-government Daily News today was scathing in its criticism of the many countries, including India and the US, that have called for a pause in the fighting.        
	None of those who are urging from afar a humanitarian pause/ceasefire, amnesty and talks with the Tigers are going to live in Sri Lanka when the suicide bombers strike again, the parcel bombs go off in shops and at bus stops, said the article, which was headlined, Get your humanitarian paws off my country.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Calcutta, March 12: Electoral alliances against the Left Front in the past did not make much of a difference to Bengals politics. It may be different this time.         
	Mamata Banerjees alliances with the BJP  in the Lok Sabha elections in 1999 and 2004  were not even expected to change things much because the saffron brigade was never a force in Bengal.        
	Even the Congress-Trinamul alliance for the Assembly polls in 2001 posed no great threat to the CPMs long reign.        
	But the two parties joining hands this time, along with some minor players, may shake the ground under the Marxists feet.        
	There is absolutely no point comparing this times Congress-Trinamul alliance with the one in 2001. Then the weight of Mamatas challenge to the CPM was still an unknown quantity. The Congress, which had been almost decimated in Bengal since Mamata left it, was in political wilderness at the national level, too.         
	Today, the Congress-led UPA is not only the ruling combine in New Delhi but is also seen as the frontrunner in these parliamentary polls. To the strength of a rejuvenated Congress is now added Mamatas growing appeal among anti-CPM voters.         
	What gives the Congress-Trinamul tie-up its greatest strength, however, is the steady erosion in the CPMs support base, thanks to Singur and Nandigram. If Buddhadeb Bhattacharjees industrialisation drive has won him some new friends among urban voters, it has lost the CPM a lot more rural voters. Last Mays panchayat polls proved that beyond a shade of doubt.        
	Such is this new anti-CPM mood that ultra-Left forces now have no qualms about supporting the Congress-Trinamul alliance. Protests by liberal intellectuals on land acquisition issues at Singur and Nandigram signalled this change.         
	These elections are the first time that not just Left-leaning liberals but also the ultra-Left can be heard saying they would vote Mamata despite all their uneasiness about her brand of politics.         
	Such people are not large in number nor is their influence all that great among the masses. But their voices matter among Bengalis who, like the chief minister himself until recently, prefer poetry to economic well-being.         
	Thus the SUCI, which always prided itself on being more Left than the mainstream Left, is a partner in this times alliance. In the eagerness to see the end of the CPMs rule, the SUCI even shifted from its earlier position that it would not join a Trinamul-led front if the Congress were part of it.         
	It is a small party but its cadres are among the most tenacious political activists in Bengal. By agreeing to give the SUCI one seat, Mamata clearly wants to send out the message that she has the support of Leftists, too, in the campaign against the CPM. And, not all these Leftists are Maoists.         
	True, the way Mamata forced the Congress to accept her terms makes it a bad start for the alliance. One does not have to be too close to either Mamata or Bengal Congress leaders to know how little the two sides trust each other. But the changed political context  both in Bengal and at the national level  has forced them to go for yet another marriage of convenience. Both hope to gain from it.         
	How it shapes after the polls and how long it will last will depend on the numbers  especially of the Congress  in the next Lok Sabha.         
	But there is no doubt about one thing  if it works on the ground, the alliance may substantially reduce the CPMs numbers.

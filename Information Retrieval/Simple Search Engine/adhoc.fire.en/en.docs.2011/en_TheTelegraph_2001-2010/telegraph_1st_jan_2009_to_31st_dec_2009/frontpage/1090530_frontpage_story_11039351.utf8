The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Soren in seat fix
                                                                                                           Soren in seat fix
          SUDHIT KUMAR MISHRA                              
	Ranchi, May 29: JMM chief Shibu Soren is trapped between the proverbial devil and the deep sea. He has just two days to decide whether he wishes to continue to represent Dumka in the 15th Lok Sabha, or retain his Jamtara Assembly seat.        
	While the JMM expects the Congress to keep its word and help Soren become the chief minister again, the latter is busy working out measures to form its own government with Speaker Alamgir Alam at the helm and a JMM candidate as a Speaker.         
	Last evening, after making a courtesy visit to the Raj Bhavan, Alam dashed to Delhi. On the same flight there was former deputy chief minister Sudhir Mahto (JMM) and former minister Kamlesh Kumar Singh (NCP).        
	After Soren and Madhu Koda were both denied berths in the Union cabinet, despite extending support to the UPA, Jharkhand politics is now their final option.         
	During seat-sharing talks after the Lok Sabha elections, the Congress categorically stressed that it would help Soren become the chief minister if he won the Jamtara Assembly seat, said Sudhir Mahto over telephone.        
	Five former MLAs  Arjun Munda, Karia Munda and P.N. Singh (BJP) and Independents Madhu Koda and Inder Singh Namdhari  have been elected to the Lok Sabha. All have quit the Assembly reducing its effective strength to 73.         
	Former minister Kamlesh Kumar Singh argued that in the changed scenario, Congress and its allies could easily prove their majority in the Assembly, without depending upon the Left, the Jharkhand Party or Independent Harinarayan Rai.        
	But the moot question is whether the 18 JMM legislators will help the Congress form a government in the state, especially when Shibu Soren has been denied a berth in the Union cabinet. Sources said that Soren may try his best to convince the Congress leadership to give him Jharkhand, but might be forced to quit the Jamtara seat.        
	As the JMM chiefs younger son, Hemant Soren, said, his father would decide by tomorrow.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Poll bonus for tech teachers
                                                                                                           Poll bonus for tech teachers
          CHARU SUDAN KASTURI                               
	New Delhi, Feb. 28: Faculty in all central technical education institutions, including the IITs and IIMs, will receive a one-time compensation for the likely delay in implementation of a promised salary hike.         
	The government has decided to dole out an advance sum for the faculty members, its anxiety over discontent in election season prevailing over its strategy to economise, top officials said.         
	The amount to be paid to each faculty member has been decided according to the position in the teaching hierarchy and will later be compensated against arrears due to them under the new pay regime.         
	The heads of the institutions  vice-chancellors or directors  are to receive Rs 2 lakh each, while professors have been allocated Rs 1.5 lakh each. The amount reduces to Rs 1 lakh for assistant professors and just below a lakh for associate professors and lecturers.         
	The human resource development ministry has issued an order notifying the provision of the advance arrears which are likely to accompany the salary in March, sources said.         
	The payment  some officials are jokingly calling it an election bonus  now will also help the government reduce the tax burden next year, the sources explained.         
	The one-time amount notification covers all faculty who are to benefit from the largesse proposed earlier this month by a central review panel under Goverdhan Mehta, the former Indian Institute of Science director.         
	Teachers at the National Institutes of Technology, the Indian Institutes of Information Technology, the Indian Institutes of Science Education and Research and the Schools of Planning and Architecture will benefit.         
	It also covers engineering colleges in central universities  so engineering teachers at Delhi University or Jadavpur University will receive the amount.         
	The decision to offer the advance arrears was taken amid the increasing likelihood that the government may not be able to implement before elections the unprecedented pay hikes proposed by a central review panel earlier this month. The pay hikes proposed by the panel need to be approved by the Union cabinet before they can be notified.         
	But the cabinet may not be in a position to clear the proposal before the announcement of elections. The declaration of the salary raise after the declaration of polls could attract charges of allurement from the Election Commission, officials fear.         
	The pay hike, once notified, will be with retrospective effect from January 1, 2006.         
	The advance amount will be deducted from the arrears due for the period from January 1, 2006, to the date of notification of the pay hike, and faculty members will receive the remainder as arrears.

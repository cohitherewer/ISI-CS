	Ranchi, Feb. 27: Two pending power projects of NTPC and DVC were jolted back to life after Governor Syed Sibtey Razi approved a proposal to compensate encroachers of government land, thereby paving the way for land to be transferred to the companies and work to begin.        
	At a meeting of his council of advisers early this week, Razi ruled that people occupying gairmajarua land (encroachers) for more than 30 years will also be compensated from project costs, thereby reviving the National Thermal Power Corporations 1980 MW project at Tandwa under rebel-infested Chatra.        
	His decision will also help DVC which is putting up a 1,000 MW thermal power project in Koderma. According to an NTPC spokesman, the project would need 2,620 acres, of which 750 acre was gairmajarua (government) land, while 1,550 acre belonged to private parties. The remaining 320 acre was MGR, or merry go round, land meant for laying railway tracks to link the plant site to coalmines. As of now, NTPC has possession of 1,000 acre.        
	S.K.Tiwary, the deputy general manager (DGM) of NTPC, said the Governors decision would immediately facilitate the handing over 269 acre of the 750 acre government land earmarked for the project. For the rest of the government land, papers are ready. Now, the Chatra deputy commissioner is free to effect its transfer, he said, adding the project would finally get the impetus as people occupying government land would finally believe that they too would be compensated.        
	Land acquisition has proved to be a major hurdle for private players willing to take part in the industrialisation of this mineral-rich state. But state-owned NTPC was faced with a similar reality back in 1999 soon after the then prime minister, Atal Behari Vajpayee, laid the foundation for the Rs 1,000 crore project on March 6.         
	Later, it was abandoned. In 2006, faced with acute an power crisis in the country, NTPC revived the project. But it suffered due to lack of funds and the bifurcation of Bihar.         
	The project has been linked to the Garhi dam for water. Central Coalfields also plans to open its Magadh project to supply coal to the project.

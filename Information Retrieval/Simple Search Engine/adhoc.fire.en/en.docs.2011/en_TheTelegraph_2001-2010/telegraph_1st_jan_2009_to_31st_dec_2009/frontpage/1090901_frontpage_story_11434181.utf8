The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Local apathy killing NREGS
                                                                                                           Local apathy killing NREGS
  - Capital meet calls districts bluff on fighting corruption           AMIT GUPTA                                    
	Ranchi, Aug. 31: District and block officials not taking action on specific complaints on various projects undertaken under the National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme is emerging as the primary reason for Jharkhand faring dismally in the implementation of the Centres flagship programme for rural uplift.        
	At a daylong state-level meeting aimed at evaluating district social audits and public hearings of NREGS  conducted across Jharkhand between July 28 and August 25  at Administrative Training Institute proved to be an eye-opener for authorities monitoring NREGS in the state.        
	The action-taken reports submitted by most districts are vague in nature. We need to be more specific before presenting a picture to the Centre, said NREGA commissioner Sunil Kumar Burnwal.        
	The findings were telling.        
	lIn extremist-infested Markachcho block of Koderma, one Prakash Singh hadnt worked for a single day in any NREGS project. Yet his name was included in the muster roll. The issue was raised at block and district-level social audits but the authorities did not take action. This prompted rural development secretary Santosh Kumar Satpathy to take up the case at the state level        
	lIn Hazaribagh district, construction of 2,300 wells were taken up in 2006-07 and 2007-08 fiscals. Each village should have got 10 wells in private plots but a sizeable number was still incomplete. This, too, was taken up by Satpathy        
	lAnother irregularity apparently rampant in Koderma district was revealed by an NGO representative of the local council  four schemes were sanctioned simultaneously in a private plot. The state authorities decided to look into the matter        
	Todays meeting found that Chatra, Giridih and Simdega districts failed to submit action-taken reports on the various complaints on the scheme. They were asked to submit their reports by September 4 failing which all deputy commissioners would be summoned to the capital.                          
	Besides, action-taken reports of Gumla, Bokaro, Koderma and Hazaribagh werent in proper format. Respective deputy development commissioners were asked to correct them by tomorrow.        
	A number of complaints were voiced throughout the day.         
	These included the case of a woman from Ramgarh who was charged Rs 530 for a job card and for opening an account either with a bank or post-office, panchayat sevaks asking for their cut in schemes et al.         
	Moreover, exaggerated estimates of a scheme (like 2.18 lakh for a 20x30 well) and complaints that government authorities and contractors destroyed social audit reports also came up. These werent new, but for the first time they were to be probed at the state level.        
	Satpathy said the involvement of NGOs in social audit teams was proving to be effective.        
	District representatives found themselves cornered when their tall claims were challenged by watchdogs of the rural scheme, prompting authorities to take immediate action at the state level.        
	For instance, when the meeting was told that in Domchanch block of Koderma, no public hearing was conducted, Satpathy issued instructions to conduct one there soon.        
	Based on the feedback from the districts and blocks, a state-level action-taken report would now be presented to the Centre by Burnwal.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Great insincerity by Advani 
                                                                                                           Great insincerity by Advani 
          MANINI CHATTERJEE                                              Jaswant Singh and (below)
 L.K. Advani      
	New Delhi, Aug. 28: Lal Krishna Advanis decision to stay on as leader of Opposition in the Lok Sabha after his partys defeat in the 15th general election was an act of great insincerity and diminished both his own stature and that of the party, expelled BJP veteran Jaswant Singh said here today.        
	In a freewheeling conversation with The Telegraph on his three-decade-long, often ambiguous, relationship with the BJP leadership and ideology, Jaswant made it clear that he was not among those who sought to persuade Advani to take on the leader of Opposition post. Advani, who campaigned in the elections as the BJPs prime ministerial candidate, ostensibly changed his mind about assuming the cabinet-rank post of LoP after aides and colleagues persuaded him that his departure at this stage was not in the interest of the party.        
	Scoffing at that claim, Jaswant said: This is not a question of persuasion. It had to be a decision based on principle. When Advaniji announced that he was resigning, it wasnt as if there was instantaneous outburst of protest. To me, it appeared more as a calculated demonstration, almost feudal in its basics. Then I realised there is great insincerity.        
	Had Advani stuck to his initial decision of resigning, he would have gained in stature infinitely, Jaswant said, adding, it would have restored a degree of moral credibility not just to his personality but to the party as a whole.        
	When pointed out that there were whispered allegations in BJP circles that Jaswant himself coveted the post (having been the LoP in the Rajya Sabha and now a member of the Lok Sabha) and that he might never have brought out the Jinnah book if he had got the top job, he winced but said without anger: That is completely wrong. I was working on the Jinnah book for five years. And I am not after the tinsel of office.        
	In fact, he had told Advani long before the Lok Sabha results came in that this would be his last election, that after eight terms in Parliament he was looking to retire since I am not a 24-hour politician.        
	He had begun to realise about two years back that I had come to the end of the road, and I would have to think the rest of my life afresh and had discussed it with his wife many times.        
	But voluntarily walking into the sunset is one thing; being summarily expelled from the party of which he was a founding member something else entirely. Was he more pained by the decision to expel him or the manner in which it was done? Both, he says, promptly. I question the decision to expel  the choice of the word itself is so objectionable. As for the manner, he remains wordless but that Advaniji did not speak to him before or since the expulsion has left him both saddened and bitter.        
	One reason, perhaps, is the peculiar camaraderie they shared despite their known ideological differences. Jaswant insists that he always differed with the BJPs turn towards Hindutva since the late 1980s.        
	For the first 10 years of his political life, he remained unaffiliated to any political party. He resigned from the cavalry regiment of the Indian Army in November 1966 and contested  and lost  the Jodhpur seat in the 1967 general election. He fought as an Independent though party tickets were available aplenty.        
	I met Rajmata Gayatri Devi at the Polo Bar of the Rambagh Palace hotel in 1966. Minoo Masani was also there. She said join the Swatantra Party. And I said I am sorry, your highness, but I cant. There are far too many princes there.        
	Rajasthans Jana Sangh boss Bhairon Singh Shekhawat, in less luxurious surroundings presumably, made the same offer. But if the Swatantra Party was too full of old feudals, the Jana Sangh and the RSS had too many bigots for Jaswants liking. I told Skekhawatji I am sorry but I dont like your ideology all that much. I didnt like the exaggerated anti-Muslimism for I come from a part of India where Hindus and Muslims have always lived in harmony together.         
	As a former army officer, Jaswants aides will tell you, he also found pot-bellied men in khaki shorts with military pretensions slightly pathetic. But all that he is willing to say today is I was not particularly impressed with either the Jana Sangh or RSS.        
	He eventually joined the Janata Party after it came into being post-Emergency and when the Janata Party broke up amidst unacceptable behaviour and unseemly squabbles, he decided to join the BJP which was formed in April 1980. The BJP would be different from the old Jana Sangh  espousing Gandhian socialism and inclusiveness, carrying forward the Janata legacy but wrapped in more organisational discipline. Or so Jaswant thought.        
	Was Atal Behari Vajpayee, the first president of the BJP, a crucial factor? Surprisingly, Jaswant says no. I didnt know Atalji very well then; Shekhawatji was more of a factor since I knew him from Rajasthan.        
	For the first five years of its existence, the BJP tried to make a go of its moderate avatar. But after the 1984 debacle, when the party was reduced to two seats, and especially after Advani took over as president in 1986, the turn towards Hindutva became increasingly evident.        
	Why didnt Jaswant, the self-proclaimed liberal in the ranks, the green pigeon among the saffron cats, protest? On Ayodhya, I did protest, he says. At the Palampur national executive in 1989, he disagreed with the twin decisions to ally with the Shiv Sena and back the Ramjanmabhoomi agitation.         
	When Advani decided to launch the rathyatra and announced it at a meeting: I said I am sorry I do not advise this, I do not agree with this, but I was outvoted. (He doesnt recall if Vajpayee was at that meeting.) As the rathyatra passed through his constituency in Rajasthan and Shekhawat advised him to receive Advani: I said I cannot come to receive Advaniji because I do not agree with the programme. I would be a hypocrite, to go there to simply curry favour.        
	Yet when Advani was arrested, and later attacked in Parliament after the demolition of the Babri Masjid: I stood up to defend him, to defend the BJP. Wasnt that a strange thing to do? Jaswant cites his military background to justify the contradiction that lay at the heart of his long innings with the BJP.         
	I can get a wrong order but in the middle of the battle I cannot say I have got a wrong order. I have to fight for the unit I belong. That is the foundation of military discipline. Otherwise, why would a soldier die?        
	It is for the same reason that though he, along with Vajpayee, felt that Narendra Modi should go after the Gujarat riots in 2002 (the burning of the bogey at Godhra was wrong but burning of human beings after that was far worse), he kept quiet when Atalji desisted from acting. The NDA government was in power then and if I jumped ship, it would again have been an act of treachery, Jaswant feels.        
	Jaswants relationship with Advani and other hardliners in the BJP was both ambiguous and mutually beneficial, it would seem. Jaswant himself admits that he was the partys obligatory Negro  the token liberal that suited the partys periodic bid to claim a more inclusive imagery.        
	His differences with the partys ideology never came in the way of his getting key posts both in and out of government, which he acknowledges graciously. I do place on record my appreciation of both Atalji and Advaniji that despite my differences, they didnt bear a grudge against me. Over the years, the sense of kinship, of affinity with the two leaders grew and Jaswant insists that he had equally good relations with both. I am nobodys camp follower, he says, stressing that it was wrong to regard him as an Atal man.         
	The unique  some would say opportunistic  combination of being an obligatory Negro and a military man gave Jaswant a special space and position in the party  he never agreed with the partys illiberal impulse but never spoke out against it publicly nor thought of severing ties with the party.        
	That is why he is so bewildered at the BJPs decision to expel him in the twilight of what can only be described as an unusual political career for merely writing a book about history. And so embittered that Advani, whose views on Jinnah he sought to endorse, has not once bothered to phone him.        
	In retrospect, does he regret not having quit the BJP in 1992 or 2002? Jaswant looks into the distance, shrugs, and murmurs almost to himself: It is one of those ifs of life  what if  so difficult to answer, you know. But one thing is clear: the pigeon that may have got accidentally slaughtered in a raging cat fight is not about to retire quietly

          SANJAY MANDAL                              
	Calcutta, Dec. 7: If you expected the state government to practise what it is preaching to the private healthcare sector, you can forget it.        
	The government is set to pass a law to punish private hospitals that neglect or overcharge patients or turn away the critically ill, but a senior official admitted there were no plans for similar measures against state hospitals, which face such charges every day.        
	State-run hospitals or the doctors working there dont come under the ambit of this law. To stop refusal (of admission) at government hospitals, we need more medical colleges and beds. Presently there are no specific plans to solve this problem, Aniruddha Kar, director of health services, said today.        
	Under the West Bengal Clinical Establishment (Registration and Regulation) Bill, 2009, to be tabled in mid-December, a tribunal will award compensation within six months to victims of negligence or overcharging at private healthcare units, including pathology labs.        
	The Telegraph today spoke to people left devastated by negligence, to them or a loved one, at a state-run hospital.        
	On December 24 last year, Kanak Auddy, 76, died after being left untreated for two hours at Calcutta National Medical College and Hospital. His family was Rs 50 short of the admission fee of Rs 150 hospital officials had said no free bed was vacant.        
	Kanaks brother Arjun promised to get the balance immediately and requested that treatment be started. But until he brought the money, the nurses did not restore the oxygen support provided by the doctor at the emergency department, Kanaks wife Dipali, 65, said.        
	I wrote a complaint to the health department in a letter but have not yet received even an acknowledgement, she said.        
	Kuldip Yadav, a driver, suffered severe head injuries in an accident on Park Street on November 17, 2006, and was rushed to SSKM Hospital.        
	He was left on a trolley for two hours. We pleaded with the doctors to do something but they didnt, said Raju, a friend. Kuldips friends took him to a private hospital where he had surgery for brain haemorrhage.        
	I dont know how to repay the loan my family took to pay the bill, Kuldip said. I have started driving again against doctors advice.        
	Health department sources said they had no records of how many patients state hospitals turned away. They said investigations in medical negligence cases moved slowly. The files are piling up and in most cases the doctors go scot-free, an official said.        
	In June last year, Deccan ground staff Saheli Roy, 25, died at NRS Medical College and Hospital after a road accident. Her family alleged negligence and a probe was done, but its report is under wraps.        
	Unless Swastha Bhavan asks us to take action we can do nothing, said L.K. Ghosh, NRS medical superintendent.

	London, Dec. 24: Excited children awaiting the sound of sleigh bells can now track Santas progress around the world thanks to a special website (www.noradsanta.org).        
	The North American Aerospace Defense Command (Norad) has employed all its high tech equipment to follow Father Christmas as he and the reindeers travel the globe delivering presents.        
	The Norad Santa Tracker tradition dates back to 1955 when a Colorado Springs store ran an advertisement encouraging local children to call a special telephone hot line.        
	The service is offered to children around the world via a Google earth map, providing the information in seven languages including English, Spanish and Chinese. Norad claim they employ radar and satellites to track the infrared signal given off by Rudolphs nose.

          SHASHANK SHEKHAR                              
	Bokaro, Aug. 11: Security forces comprising over 700 armed policemen and led by three superintendents of police have launched a three-pronged combing operation to flush out top Maoist leaders from the hilly forests nestled between Bokaro, Hazaribagh and Giridih.        
	The exercise, said to be one of the largest in recent times, is being monitored by two inspectors-general and director-general of police V.D. Ram, with the objective of apprehending rebel leaders like Navin Manjhi, Prabal Manjhi, Ranvir and Kundan Pahan, all of whom were said to be hiding in the area.        
	Launched yesterday, the combing operation is being led from three sides by Bokaro SP Laxman Singh, Hazaribagh SP Pankaj Kamboj and Giridih SP Asim Vikrant Minj along with CRPFs 26th battalion commandant V.S. Sharma.        
	Operation flush-out is supposed to continue till it fetches results, said sources close to Hazaribagh DIG M.S. Bhatia and coal belt DIG Prashant Singh, who were monitoring the movements of their men using sophisticated communication equipment to guard against messages being intercepted by the rebels.        
	The sources said while the Hazaribagh police entered the Bokaro zone from Vishnugarh, Girdih police entered the zone through the Nimia Ghat route. The Bokaro police entered the Maoist bastion from Penk, Nawadih, Suarbasua, Chotki Kuri even as the CRPF battalion entered the forests through Joramana.        
	Bhatia said the operation was launched to flush out top Maoists who often took shelter in the zone. Except for Kundan Pahan who mostly operates in Singhbhum and Gumla, Navin and Prabal Manji and Ranvir have been spotted in these areas, he told The Telegraph, adding the operation would continue for days. Earlier, four persons were arrested from Nawadih after they were caught with arms allegedly meant for Maoists. Three others were detained for questioning in Gomia.

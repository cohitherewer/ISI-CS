The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Out of good books? Pick up the pen
                                                                                                           Out of good books? Pick up the pen
  - Jha downplays political parallels; Jogi hopes to score where Jaswant stumbled         SANJAY K. JHA                            Ajit Jogi                                        
	New Delhi, Sept. 5: If books can snuff out political careers, they can resurrect fading politicians too.        
	Congress leader Ajit Jogi is bringing out a book that will underline his loyalty to the Nehru-Gandhi family at a time the BJP has expelled Jaswant Singh for his Jinnah book.        
	Jogis book, which hits the stands later this month, deals with 17 personalities who have inspired him since his childhood. The only Indian politician among them is Rajiv Gandhi.        
	There was speculation in political circles that Jogi had turned rebellious and had not included any Nehru-Gandhi to send out a message.        
	Jogi is indeed a bitter man these days, having been left out of the Congress mainstream and denied help in setting up his sons political career. But he cannot afford to be seen as disloyal to the Nehru-Gandhis, from whom he drew his political sustenance.        
	At the fag end of his career, the wheelchair-bound former chief ministers only dream is to push his son into the good books of Sonia Gandhi.        
	There are reports I have deliberately left out all the members of the family. It is a cock-and-bull story, Jogi told The Telegraph.        
	Mine is an honest book about personalities whose influence shaped my life. How can I leave out Rajivji, who brought me into politics? Whatever I got in life was because of Rajivji. I have great respect for my leader Soniaji but the book is only about those who were my inspiration in the initial days.        
	He denied that Rahul Gandhi had refused to release the book. I have not yet asked anybody to release the book. Let it be printed first. But I will certainly request Soniaji or Rahulji to release the book, he said.        
	The book, written in Hindi and being brought out by a Raipur publisher, is being translated into English too. Jogi has already authored five books in Hindi, including a collection of poems, and two in English on the role of district collectors and the administration of peripheral areas.        
	On Jogis list of 17, obscure commoners share space with global personalities like Martin Luther King and former Malaysia Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad. Bhairo, a hunter from his native village, tribal heroine Rani Durgawati and a little-known advocate, Rajender Singh, make the list, which includes Greek mythological hero Achilles and Sant Kabir.        
	Figuring prominently in the book is the late US President Franklin D. Roosevelt, who was paralysed from waist downwards like Jogi, who survived an accident over five years ago.        
	Former British Prime Minister Margaret Thatchers inclusion ahead of Indira Gandhi may raise eyebrows, but Jogi may have left Indira out since too many members from one family might have attracted charges of sycophancy.        
	Jogi says reading political meanings into the choice of heroes will be wrong. He claims he went by his instincts, not politics. He says he has no reason to feel disgruntled since it was Sonia who had made him chief minister. Now, he says, seeing Rahul as Prime Minister is one of the few dreams he has left.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | TCS rate cited for Buddha land offer
                                                                                                           TCS rate cited for Buddha land offer
          OUR BUREAU                              
	Calcutta, Sept. 18: Housing minister Goutam Deb has named a price of Rs 1.5 crore an acre for the land offered to Infosys and Wipro but has left it to Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee to strike an acceptable deal with the companies.        
	Tata Consultancy Services has got land at that rate and so the price shouldnt be a problem, Deb said but the two companies had earlier declined to pay more than Rs 50 lakh an acre.        
	Neither, however, is likely to jump at the offer the chief minister made yesterday because information technology is in no position to splash out on new facilities because of the global downturn.        
	Last month, Infosys CEO S. Gopalakrishnan had said (we) do not require any more land for any new infrastructure We cannot outline any timeframe for the proposed facility in Bengal.        
	Wipro chief financial officer Suresh Senapaty had echoed him.         
	Both companies welcomed the fresh offer but Infosys made progress conditional upon the business environment improving. Which means its not as if the two will come running to Bengal as soon as the chief minister makes room.        
	Bengal was in a hurry to make a public offer of alternative land to paint over its crinkled image after the Vedic Village violence led it to cancel the deal under which the two companies were to be provided 90 acres each.        
	Given the reluctance of the industry to expand, it could have waited before calling off the deal instead of taking another blow so soon after Tata Motors departure. But the political situation demanded otherwise.        
	Several IT companies have taken land at Bantala but, except for Cognizant, no one is completing their projects.        
	The CEO of a software company said: I dont think any company will go in for any new physical infrastructure development right now.        
	Kiran Karnik, a former president of Nasscom, agreed.        
	So, though Deb has set the price benchmark, the companies may not be itching to strike what he calls an acceptable deal on the plots at Rajarhats New Town.        
	Our chief minister will be talking to them to know their views on the rates we want. But the prices are negotiable , Deb said.        
	The companies have been offered land in an area where Delhi Public School, the Saha Institute of Nuclear Physics and IIT Kharagpur have been allotted plots. Land filling is complete and a 10-lane road is under construction.

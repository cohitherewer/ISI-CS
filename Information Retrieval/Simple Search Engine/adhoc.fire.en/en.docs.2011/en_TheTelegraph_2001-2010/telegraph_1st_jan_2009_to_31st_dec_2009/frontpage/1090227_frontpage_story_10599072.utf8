The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Goodbye, Speaker
                                                                                                           Goodbye, Speaker
  - Absent PM salutes role model          MANINI CHATTERJEE                            Chatterjee outside the House. (Rajesh Kumar)                                        
	New Delhi, Feb. 26: The last sitting of the last session of the Fourteenth Lok Sabha this afternoon had all the sentiments  nostalgia, goodwill, bipartisan bonhomie  that mark a school assembly at the end of a raucous term. Except for one difference. Practically all the students gathered in the high-domed chamber secretly hoped to return after their gruelling board exams this summer.        
	But the headmaster was leaving his home of nearly four decades, never to return.        
	Goodbye, Mr Chatterjee, was the underlying theme of todays valedictory session and Speaker Somnath Chatterjee  not the most laconic of men  bid himself a long goodbye. With good reason.        
	The Fourteenth Lok Sabha, according to Prime Minister Manmohan Singh whose speech was read out by leader of the House Pranab Mukherjee, enacted legislation that redefined the role and rights of citizens. Its five-year term witnessed the unique partnership between Sonia Gandhi and Manmohan Singh at the helm, a stormy relationship between the Congress and the Left which ended in divorce, and the unexpected success of the Grand Old Party in running a coalition to its full term.        
	But for all that, history will remember this Lok Sabha most for the man who presided over its proceedings for five years, a man who started out being attacked by the Right for being too dictatorial in his handling of the House and ended by alienating the Left whose ranks he left in order to uphold the dignity of the Chair rather than be loyal to a mere seat bestowed by his party.        
	No wonder then that Chatterjee was the hero of the Prime Ministers short speech. Referring to him as a role model, Singh said: There were unusual times in which you had to take a call between defending parliamentary propriety and heeding to the demands of the organisation that you had spent a lifetime building. On all such occasions your sagacity prevailed.        
	Extolling him for upholding the dignity of Parliament in times of personal trial, the Prime Minister added: I express the sentiments of all the members of this House when I say that in Sri Somnath Chatterjee, the office of the Speaker of the Lok Sabha has been truly elevated and dignified. History would be the best judge of your unique contribution. You stood like a rock to defend our best parliamentary traditions and in doing so have raised the bar for those to follow.        
	When his turn came, Chatterjee made it clear that history had already judged him and he was more than pleased with the verdict.        
	At the end of a long speech  filled with such copious detail that his grand-daughter, too, dozed off in the gallery  Chatterjee finally came to the moment everyone was waiting for.        
	No, he did not break down and his voice choked for barely a moment before resuming its stentorian tone. But when he said, I am also reaching my journeys end and in a short while I shall be leaving this Chamber for the last time, there was a sudden poignancy in the air that even a media gallery packed with cynics could not ignore.        
	The Prime Minister tangentially referred to Chatterjees role in building the CPM organisation, but the Speaker himself revealed what party insiders have always known  that it was not party but parliamentary work that always enthralled him.        
	He recalled his first term in the Fifth Lok Sabha when he was allotted seat No. 512 buried in the back benches and how as a humble servant of the House of the People, I have had the great opportunity to serve the nation through this great institution for nearly 39 years with a short break of 11 months.        
	He made a point to mention that as the Leader of the Party in the Lok Sabha for 15 years he had raised issues of the working class and vulnerable sections of the society. Although the party in question went unnamed, his mentor came in for special praise. He said: I cannot but recall the great guidance and encouragement and affection that I received from my leaders, particularly Comrade Jyoti Basu.        
	That said, he underlined that he had no regrets over his decision last July to remain Speaker. In consonance with the spirit of the Constitution, I took a considered decision to stand by the Constitution of India and not allowed myself to take a course of action, which would have, in my view, seriously compromised my position as Speaker of the supreme legislature of the country.        
	The party may have expelled him but the world at large had engulfed him in a warm embrace. I was completely overwhelmed, Chatterjee confessed, by the tremendous outpouring of support and appreciation that I received from not only the citizens of this country but also from the Indian diaspora, on what they acknowledged as my principled stand on a very vital issue on the role of the Speaker.         
	Basking in the glow of making history, Chatterjee -- erstwhile comrades be warned  isnt about to go gentle into the good night.

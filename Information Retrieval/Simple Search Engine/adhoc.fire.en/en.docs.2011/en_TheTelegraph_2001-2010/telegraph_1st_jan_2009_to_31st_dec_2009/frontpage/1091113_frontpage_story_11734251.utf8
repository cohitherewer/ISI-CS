  - Nitish inaugurates Infocom 09          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                     
	Patna, Nov. 12: From the primordial Remington typewriter to e-governance, Bihar seems to have travelled aeons within a short span of four years.         
	At Infocom 2009-10 Bihar Plugged In, organised by Businessworld and The Telegraph, chief minister Nitish Kumar today said that his government had decided to accord industry status to the IT sector, a policy for which will be unveiled soon. So far, our state did not have an IT policy. I take pleasure in announcing that such a policy will be framed soon and industry status accorded to the IT sector, he said.         
	Chief guest on the occasion, Nitish set in motion the two-day conference-cum-exhibition in the presence of noted entrepreneurs, investors, academics and IT professionals from across the country.         
	We inherited a secretariat equipped with the Remington typewriter. I found it hard to decipher what was typed on the substandard piece of paper despite the fact that I am not uneducated, the chief minister said, as the audience burst into laughter.         
	He added: Today, our government is winning national awards in e-governance. Our registration offices and administrative units even at the grassroots level stand connected to the web world.         
	Nitish thanked organisers for this first-of-its-kind mega IT event in the state and invited entrepreneurs and investors to open shop in Bihar. Promising security, profit and a state full of talent, he said: The era of fear is over. We keep awake through the night so that you can sleep in peace. The change is visible. The law and order situation has greatly improved.         
	In sharp departure to predecessor Lalu Prasads maverick remark IT waiti kya hota hai, deputy chief minister Sushil Kumar Modi informed the gathering how the Nitish government was in the process of building IT infrastructure and preparing a pool of IT professionals. We have 1,000 secondary schools equipped with 10 computers each and skilled teachers, Modi said, adding that the number would soon increase to 4,000. Panchayats, too, boast internet under the Basudha programme, he pointed out. Modi conceded that Bihar had remained backward because it had failed to reap the benefits of the Green Revolution. But we are determined to make it to the top in the IT sector, he said, dwelling at length on how the state was striving hard to make its offices paperless.         
	Managing director and CEO of ABP Private Limited D.D. Purkayastha informed the government and the gathering about the mission of Businessworld and The Telegraph, which he described as the largest selling English paper in the eastern region, to augment the pace of development in the IT sector in Bihar and in the country. We will come out with more initiatives and ventures in Bihar in the future, he said.         
	State IT minister Anil Kumar detailed the vision of the Nitish government while IT principal secretary C.K. Mishra said how Bihar, once at the bottom of the Centres development pyramid, was climbing to the peak. President of TiE, Patna, and spokesperson of Bihar IT Association P.K. Sinha summed it up. He said his association was keen to work for advancement in the IT sector, given the changing environment of investment and better law and order in the state.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | More effort needed at micro level
                                                                                                           More effort needed at micro level
  - Unified Command advised to meet frequently amp; think ahead of rebels                                  
	Maj. Gen. (retd) Gaganjit Singh is a veteran in counter-terrorism operations in Assam, having served as the GOC, Red Horns Division. Maj. Gen. Singh, who retired in 2004 having last served with the Defence Intelligence Agency looking after counter-terrorism, concludes his series exclusively for The Telegraph on the growing concerns over Ulfa and the NDFBs fresh incursions into Bhutan        
	An integral weapon in the fight against militant outfits either in Jammu and Kashmir or in Assam is the Unified Command structure, which plans and executes counter-insurgency operations in these states.         
	The success of the Unified Command in Assam can be gauged by the number of outfits in ceasefire. It was formed for better coordination between the government, the army, paramilitary, police and intelligence agencies for sharing information and planning counter-insurgency operations.         
	Despite the odds it has to surmount, the Unified Command has been working effectively in Assam but there is scope for improvement in its avowed objective of sharing of intelligence at operational as well as actionable levels. Though the functioning of the Unified Command at the macro level is effective, there is a requirement of more coordination at the micro level. At the district level, to be precise.         
	They do have meetings between the deputy commissioner, army, the police and intelligence officials but its frequency needs to be increased  say one meeting every fortnight, to ensure regular and quality flow of intelligence. These meetings can also ensure the participation of gaonburas (village headmen) because most Ulfa and NDFB recruits are from the countryside and most of the planning is still done in villages away from the glare of authorities and security forces.         
	These pieces of information can then be used by the three key players of the command  the chief secretary, the DGP and the Tezpur-based GOC 4 Corps  to come up with an effective plan of action. Secondly, the command has to adopt a proactive approach instead of a reactive one. This means that we should not wait for Ulfa or the NDFB to strike. We need to plan ahead of them by analysing the inputs we have in hand well in advance so that we can upset their designs. These two initiatives, I am sure, will pay handsome dividends, especially when public support is not with the militants.         
	The Unified Command has an advantage this time round because of the appointment of G.K. Pillai as Union home secretary. The senior bureaucrat had been in charge of the Northeast for a long time to understand the ground realities. His advice and understanding will always be beneficial to deal with insurgency in Assam and the Northeast.         
	When he was joint secretary (home), he used to regularly visit the Northeast and attend official meetings and interact with cross-sections of people to know the actual ground realities  a must to make effective analysis to deal with the problem at hand.         
	Finally, all the agencies which are a part of the command must work together with the aim of bringing peace to Assam which will benefit all spheres of life and bring prosperity to the state. This can be achieved.         
	Concluded

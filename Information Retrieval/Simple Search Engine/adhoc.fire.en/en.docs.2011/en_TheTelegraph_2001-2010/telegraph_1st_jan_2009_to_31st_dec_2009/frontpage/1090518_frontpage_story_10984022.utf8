	New Delhi, May 17: Shun the renegades and hug the loyalists  that was the overriding feeling in the Congress headquarters today.        
	The Congress working committee did not take names, but it was apparent soon enough that Lalu Prasad, Mulayam Singh Yadav and Ram Vilas Paswan were not among the loyalists. That tag was reserved for Mamata Banerjee, M. Karunanidhi, Sharad Pawar, Shibu Soren and Farooq Abdullah.        
	So when Rashtriya Janata Dal chief Lalu Prasad and ally Paswan re-affirmed support to the UPA, the Congress raised the bar for their re-entry, making a fine distinction between a pre-poll ally and a UPA constituent.        
	We will consult our pre-poll allies before taking any decision. By pre-poll allies, I mean those parties with whom we fought the elections together, general secretary Janardhan Dwivedi said.        
	There are parties whose support we welcome provided they have nothing to do with the BJP and the Shiv Sena. Even those with whom we did not contest still remain part of the UPA. We did not ask them to leave the UPA and they continue saying that they are still part of the coalition.        
	Dwivedis statement appeared to include some parties and exclude others. On the included list were the Trinamul Congress, DMK, NCP, JMM and the National Conference; those excluded were the RJD and Paswans Lok Janshakti Party  which maintain they are part of the UPA  and Mulayams Samajwadi Party, which had given the UPA outside support.        
	If the Congress mood was the barometer, Mamata and the other loyalists look certain to be part of the new government. But the renegades may have to hotfoot it for a while or even remain in the wilderness.        
	They (Lalu and company) deceived us badly before the polls, they spurned our offer for an alliance. If this is their commitment to the ethics of coalition politics, wed rather not have them, a source said.        
	Two leaders reportedly spoke up against having anything to do with the trio --- Digvijay Singh, the general secretary in charge of Uttar Pradesh, and Ashok Ram, the leader of the Congress legislature party in Bihar.        
	Digvijay, who echoed Rahul Gandhis thinking, said the Congress was in revival mode in Uttar Pradesh and bringing Mulayam on board the UPA would thwart the process. Sharma said Bihar party workers wanted to have nothing to do with Lalu Prasad.        
	The CWC then decided that if new allies were to be included, the loyalists would have to be consulted. The Congress and its allies are slated to meet on Tuesday.        
	With the UPA just short of 11 MPs to make the 272 magic mark, Congress sources said it was better to tap the 10 Independents and later Ajit Singhs Rashtriya Lok Dal (five MPs) than consider Lalu Prasad and Mulayam. Paswan does not count for anything because he drew a blank.        
	Sources said if Lalu Prasad, Mulayam and H.D. Deve Gowdas Janata Dal (Secular) willingly offered letters of support to the government, well welcome those without any strings attached.        
	We were keen to tie up with the Dal (S) but they rebuffed us, a Congress general secretary said.        
	Asked if the Congress would not like a cushion of 278 or more seats, a source said: What is the probability of this government falling? Virtually nil. Not for the next two-three years at least. If theres a looming crisis, we can re-engineer our support on the floor of the House.

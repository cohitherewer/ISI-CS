                                Stage fright                            
	Los Angeles, Aug. 17 (PTI): Actor Hugh Grant has announced that he is hanging up his acting shoes.        
	The Notting Hill actor said that Did You Hear About The Morgans? would be his last film. The actor, who has often complained of stage fright, said that he found acting a miserable experience and, therefore, had decided to take a final bow, reports Entertainment Weekly magazine.        
	In recent years, Ive had really bad attacks where I totally froze up. I thought: Well, if I am going to get stage fright, then I am packing it in, said the actor.         
	The 48-year-old star said that he had been on the verge of quitting before his audition for Four Weddings and a Funeral.

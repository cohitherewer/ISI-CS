                                                                                                           Obama most stylish, says poll
                                Obama: Sharp amp; trendy                             
	London, June 16: President Barack Obama has been named the most stylish man in a poll of 3,000 men.         
	The President, who moved into the White House in January, has impressed fashion experts across the globe with his sharp suits and smooth sense of style. Brad Pitt, the Hollywood actor, came second thanks to his ability to look stylish in a sharp suit and dressed down jeans.         
	Jonathan Heilbron, President amp; CEO of luxury shirt company Thomas Pink, which carried out the poll, said: Barack Obama has a great sense of style, which no doubt adds to his popularity. World leaders and politicians are not known for their dress sense, so its refreshing to have Obama who seems to genuinely care about his appearance.        
	Third place in the poll of 3,000 men was taken by David Beckham, whose trendy style has seen him become one of the most photographed men in the world. Daniel Craig, the James Bond star, is at number four, followed by The Godfather actor Al Pacino.         
	George Clooney was voted into sixth place, with designer Giorgio Armani even saying that the former ER star makes a suit look simply fantastic.         
	Bill Nighy, who has recently been on the big screen in The Boat That Rocked, came seventh, while painter and filmmaker Andy Warhol was at eight. Clint Eastwood and Will Smith completed the top ten.         
	The poll also asked what they considered to be the most essential fashion items in a mans wardrobe; a crisp white shirt came first followed by a pair of blue jeans and a casual t-shirt. The nominated most stylish men have all been photographed numerous times wearing white shirts, each adding their own individual stamp to this most timeless of looks.         
	Heilbron said: These guys have access to the latest designer trends and can get away with wearing virtually anything, yet time and time again they are seen in a sharp white shirt with jeans or a suit.

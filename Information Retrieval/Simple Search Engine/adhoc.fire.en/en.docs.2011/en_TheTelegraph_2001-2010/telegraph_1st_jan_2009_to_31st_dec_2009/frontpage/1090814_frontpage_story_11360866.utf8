  - If a Congress govt wants a name, it cannot look beyond three. The latest so blessed is an LPG scheme, the 175th to be named after a Nehru-Gandhi          RADHIKA RAMASESHAN                                                    
	New Delhi, Aug. 13: Indians can celebrate this Independence Day assured that a missing link in an adulatory welfare chain has finally fallen into place.        
	A cooking gas scheme will be renamed after Rajiv Gandhi five days from August 15 on his birth anniversary.        
	The launch of the very government-sounding Rajiv Gandhi Grameen LPG Vitrak Yojana should ideally have found pride of place in a state gazette or a Congress manifesto, but is being chronicled here because it represents a milestone moment.        
	From dawn to dusk and beyond, just as at least one Amitabh Bachchan movie used to be viewed by a fan at any given point of time, one scheme or the other named after a Nehru-Gandhi will touch  or hope to touch  the everyday life of some Indians in some corner of the country.        
	Another statistical gem: this is the 175th scheme to be named in India after a Nehru-Gandhi.        
	For a young republic of 59 years, such a strike rate  never mind opponents are calling it sycophancy  was possible because of the messianic zeal of Congress ministers and satraps keen to catch the eye of the first family.        
	But the latest round in an all-too-familiar name game also marks a course correction. The eagerness to name the LPG scheme after the former Prime Minister stemmed from a perception among some Congress ministers that the party wasted a golden opportunity to name the rural job scheme after one of the Nehru-Gandhis.        
	The National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme, the UPAs flagship programme, considered a blockbuster after initial misgivings, remains unnamed so far, although the Congress has not yet shelved an initiative to get the scheme named after Rajiv Gandhi on August 20, his birth anniversary.        
	In the first UPA, rural development, which handles the job scheme, was under the RJDs Raghuvansh Prasad Singh and the Congress did not push too hard to name the project after one of its leaders.        
	An unintended consequence was that the lack of a name left room for state governments not run by the party to project themselves as the champion of the scheme.        
	The Madhya Pradesh government, for instance, pasted the chief ministers photograph on the job cards, which made some beneficiaries think that it was a gift from the BJP, a Congress leader said. So at the outset, we must proclaim, loud and clear, that it is only the Congress and the Nehru-Gandhi family who are capable of conceptualising and executing welfare measures.        
	The lesson could not have found better students than petroleum minister Murli Deora and his deputy Jitin Prasada.        
	When Deora and Prasada, a close political aide of Rahul Gandhi, were toying with the rural LPG scheme for the past two months, they were clear it would not go the NREGS way. Prasada insisted it would be named after Indira Gandhi or Rajiv Gandhi.        
	The Congress doesnt blush at such expressions of devotion, although it was at the forefront of the campaign against Mayavati installing her own statues in Uttar Pradesh.        
	These (UPA projects) are direct, Government of India schemes beneficial to the aam aadmi. They are named after eminent former Prime Ministers. Mayavatis disproportionate expenditure is on megalomaniac statues of herself, Congress spokesperson Abhishek Manu Singhvi said.        
	Political brand-management lessons, ironically learnt from Mayavatis experience, have only strengthened the Congresss resolve to stick to names that have a strong association with the party.        
	In 1995, Mayavati named a scheme to develop Dalit-dominated villages after Ambedkar. But so high was the stature of Ambedkar that his name could not be as closely identified with Mayavatis party as the BSP thought it would be. The villages carry the Ambedkar prefix but few readily associate them with the BSP.        
	When it was in power, the BJP, which dubs the name game a typical colonisation of democracy, did resist similar temptations.        
	The Vajpayee government came under pressure from the Sangh to consider names such as Shyama Prasad Mookerji and Deen Dayal Upadhyaya. The then government opted for such sterile names as the Pradhan Mantri Gram Sadak Yojana, the Golden Quadrilateral and the Sarva Siksha Abhiyaan, although it could not escape charges of saffronisation in other fields.

          LEONARD DOYLE                            Barack and Michelle Obama                                  
	Washington, June 7: Barack and Michelle Obamas fairytale love story of an adoring couple propelled on to the international stage has caught the imagination of millions.         
	Their regular Friday date nights make the television news, and there was a stir recently when they caught Air Force One for a night at a theatre in Manhattan.        
	This weekend, they are in Paris with their young daughters  having turned down an invitation for dinner with President Nicolas Sarkozy and his wife Carla in favour of a more intimate family event.        
	But it was not always wedded bliss for the First Couple. A new book, Renegade, about Obamas unlikely run for the presidency, recounts a tense period in 2000 when the Obamas marriage was on the brink of collapse because of his restless political hunger and the familys shattered finances.        
	There was little conversation and even less romance, Richard Wolffe wrote. She was angry at his selfishness and careerism; he thought she was cold and ungrateful.        
	At the time, Obama was stuck on the lowest step of the political ladder. As a mere state Senator in Illinois, he had challenged and lost comprehensively in a Democratic primary to Bobby Rush, a popular incumbent.        
	His wife was new to motherhood, at home with their first daughter Malia, just two years old at the time. She hated the failed race for Congress in 2000, and their marriage was strained by the time their younger daughter, Sasha, was born. Politics seemed like a waste of time to Michelle, the book says.        
	Obamas troubles were compounded when he discovered he was not on the guest list for the 2000 Democratic National Convention that year, because he had annoyed party officials.         
	The First Couple now seem to have put any past issues behind them  Things are much better, Wolffe noted on television last week.        
	Were going to be fine, Wolffe quoted Michelle as saying. We just have to make sure the girls are fine. Were strong enough to take anything on and be OK at the end.        
	The book also describes the moment Michelle first realised she was in love with her future husband. It was 18 years ago and he was being paid to train 120 Black church leaders how to be community organisers in the basement of a church. There was really something powerful there. And I was like, this guy is different. He is really different in addition to being nice and funny and cute and all that, she recounted.

  Best-ever win by party since 1985          A STAFF REPORTER                                          
	Guwahati, Aug. 4: The Congress today recorded its best-ever performance in a civic election since 1985, winning a majority of the wards.         
	The mandate comes as a pleasant surprise for the ruling party as chief minister Tarun Gogoi, about three months back, had rued the apparent indifference of the urban electorate towards the Congress.         
	Till 7pm, the ruling party had won 404 of the 638 seats for which results were declared while the main Opposition, the Asom Gana Parishad, lagged behind with 85 seats. The BJP, on the other hand, could manage 59 seats, Independents 88 and CPM two.         
	The elections were held in 671 of the total 674 seats.         
	Gogoi had observed soon after the Lok Sabha results that the party needed to concentrate on the rural belt since the urban voters did not recognise the good work the party had done. The Congress had won seven Lok Sabha seats, two down from its 2004 tally.         
	The party virtually swept the polls in Upper Assam, making a clean sweep in Jorhat, Nazira municipal board, Amguri and Sonari municipal boards and Dhing town committees, among others. In fact, the party had fared particularly well in constituencies it had not done well in the last Assembly elections like Amguri, Nazira, Rangia, Silapathar, Dergaon and Hojai.         
	Political analysts attributed the impressive show of the Congress to the awareness of the urban voters. They said the outcome was expected with Congress in power, both in Dispur and Delhi.         
	The outcome, however was a blow to the AGP-BJP combine. The leaders of the combine attributed the Congress win to rigging, money and muscle power and abuse of the state machinery.         
	While AGPs Atul Bora declined to comment on the alliances performance without analysing the results, BJPs Charan Deka said the alliance was as strong as ever.         
	This will have no bearing on the Assembly elections, Bora said. The alliance fared well in Karimganj, Nalbari, Pathsala, Gouripur, Barpeta Road, Rangapara and Sapatgram. Assam PCC president Bhubaneswar Kalita attributed the triumph to the hard work of the party workers and the good work done by the Gogoi government.         
	The development work done by the state government like building roads, drains and community projects and the door-to-door campaign by our workers helped the party connect with the voters. Last time we won 80 per cent of the seats. This time, it has only improved. It is one of our best results and surely the best-ever since 1985, Kalita told The Telegraph soon after his return from Delhi this evening.         
	The PCC president also pointed out that the AGP-BJP alliance was no threat to the partys prospects in the 2011 Assembly elections.         
	This is the beginning of our victory march to Dispur for a third straight term. The Lok Sabha elections are decided more by national issues but when it comes to local issues, the masses know that there is no alternative to the Congress, Kalita added.         
	Besides the Congress sweep, the highlight of the outcome was the triumph in four out of five seats by its candidates, backed by the Trinamul Congress, to capture the Mariani Town Committee.

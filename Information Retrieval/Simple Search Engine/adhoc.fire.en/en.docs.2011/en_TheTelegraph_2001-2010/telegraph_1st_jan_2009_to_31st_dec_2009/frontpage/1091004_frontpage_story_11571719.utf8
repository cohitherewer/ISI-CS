	London, Oct. 3: Golf star Greg Norman and his tennis player wife Chris Evert have separated after just 15 months of marriage.         
	Evert got engaged to the Australian, nicknamed the Great White Shark, in December 2007 and the sporting couple were married in the Bahamas in June last year.         
	But American Evert and Norman, both 54, said yesterday that they had split, although they have pledged to remain friends.         
	The announcement came three days before Norman captains the International team at the Presidents Cup in San Francisco, where wives usually take on a visible role.         
	Evert, who won 18 grand slam titles in the 1970s and 1980s, only recently accompanied Norman at the British Open in July.         
	Just three weeks ago the couple were also seen together at the US Open tennis tournament in New York.         
	Neither Norman, who has won two British Opens, nor Evert, said whether they planned to divorce.         
	In a statement, the couple said: We will remain friends and supportive of one anothers family.         
	They requested privacy for themselves and their families.         
	Their split comes after Normans ex-wife Laura Andrassy last year warned the champion golfer not to rush into marrying Evert, who had previously been married to British tennis player John Lloyd and skier Andy Mill, with whom she had three sons.         
	Speaking after their engagement, Andrassy, who was married to Norman for 26 years, said: If I had any advice, Id tell them to enjoy a long period between the two marriages.         
	Last year, Norman took time out of his honeymoon to play the Open at Birkdale, almost pulling off the greatest win in the championships history, with Evert walking every step of the course by his side.         
	In an interview this summer, he credited his wife as a key driving force in his career.                     THE DAILY TELEGRAPH

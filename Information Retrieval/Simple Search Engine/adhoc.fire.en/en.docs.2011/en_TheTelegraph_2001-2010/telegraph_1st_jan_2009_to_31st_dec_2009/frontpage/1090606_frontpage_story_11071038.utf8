	Todays killing caps attacks on migrants for the third consecutive day today. It preceded an attack on another labourer, triggering panic among the migrant population.Police have sounded a red alert throughout the valley, while the state government has directed all police stations to identify areas with a migrant population and shift the panic-stricken residents to safer places in Imphal city.        
	The director-general of police, Yumnam Joykumar Singh, has directed police stations to be on maximum alert and check the movement of migrants.         
	The superintendent of police, Thoubal, Clay Khongsai, told the media that the UNLFs Elangbam Rojit Singh, 20, was arrested from Hiyanglam of Thoubal district at 9am. He, along with self-styled sergeant S. Jugol and self-styled lance corporal Keisam Herojit  two other UNLF cadres  had killed Thakur.        
	Khongsai said they stopped their scooter in front of the saloon. Rojit Singh told the police that Jugol had fired the shots.         
	The SP had announced a cash reward of Rs 50,000 for information leading to the arrest of the other two UNLF cadres. Two-and-a-half hours after Thakurs killing, gunmen attacked hawker Lakhsman Shah, 25, also from Bihar, at Pourabi in Imphal East.         
	Shah was selling sweets and biscuits when he came under attack. He was taken to Jawaharlal Nehru Hospital in Imphal East in a critical condition.        
	At Maphou in Imphal East, work came to a complete halt at the dam site today in protest against the killings of Sirajul Haque, a contractor and Md Tomba, a driver of Ansal Properties and Infrastructure Ltd engaged in construction of a dam over the Thoubal river.         
	Tribal villagers at the dam site today formed a committee and announced that they would not accept the bodies until the government paid ex gratia and bore the expenses for cremation.         
	The duo were abducted by unknown gunmen when they were on their way to Imphal on official work in Haques jeep yesterday. The police spotted their bullet-riddled bodies at Leimram in Bishnupur district later in the afternoon.        
	Tomba was a resident of Jiribam in Imphal East.                     
	We condemn the killing of my uncle Tomba and the contractor. What are their faults? The culprits should be punished, Abdul Rajaq demanded.        
	Bethelphai village close to the dam site also erupted in protest as Haque, who was from Silchar in Assam, was married to a tribal girl from the village.        
	Though he came from Silchar, Haque was married to our girl and had two children. He was staying in my village for the last 20 years. This is an act of cowardice and senseless violence, village head T. Baite said.        
	The deputy manager (administration) of Ansal, N.K. Singh, said workers had stopped work today in protest against the killings that had spread terror among migrants workers at the dam site.

          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Itanagar, Oct. 24: Dorjee Khandu will be sworn in as the chief minister of Arunachal Pradesh for a second term tomorrow after the Congress legislators elected him as their leader this afternoon.        
	An official source said Governor Lt Gen. J.J. Singh invited the Congress, which won by a thumping majority with 42 of the 60 seats in the Assembly, to form the government after Khandu today staked claim to power.        
	Khandu will be the lone person to be sworn in as he is expected to seek the high commands advice on the constitution of his council of ministers. The others will be sworn in within a day or two. The swearing-in will be held at the Banquet Hall here at 9.30am.        
	Khandu was elected the Congress Legislature Party leader by the newly elected legislators in the presence of AICC general secretary in-charge of Arunachal Pradesh and Union minister for planning and parliamentary affairs V. Narayanswamy, AICC general secretaries Sanjoy Bapna and Luizinho Faleiro.        
	The central observers also met all the legislators individually to seek their views on the leadership issue.        
	Chief minister Dorjee Khandu and his council of ministers resigned today, paving the way for the formation of a Congress-led ministry. The party, which has retained power with a good verdict, has reposed faith on the leadership of Dorjee Khandu, APCC general secretary T.C. Tok said.        
	Though some senior leaders like former chief minister Gegong Apang, his son Omak, PHE minister Lombo Tayeng, education minister Tatar Kipa, former deputy chief minister Kameng Dolo, former MLAs T.L. Rajkumar and Tsering Gyurmey lost their respective seats, the Congress stormed back to power.         
	Its opponents  the Trinamul, the NCP, the BJP and the PPA  could not even put up a semblance of a fight.        
	Almost all the former ministers are expected to be given portfolios.

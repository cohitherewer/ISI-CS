The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | AUDF eyes Assembly polls success
                                                                                                           AUDF eyes Assembly polls success
  - Party chief asserts key role in Assam govt formation in 2011          A STAFF REPORTER                                          
	Guwahati, May 21: The Assam United Democratic Front today asserted it would play a critical role in the formation of the next government in the state, given its growing acceptability among the voters. The assertion was made by AUDF president Badruddin Ajmal a day after extending outside support to the UPA government at the Centre. Ajmal said that Congress leaders, Ahmed Patel and Gulam Nabi Azad, had sought the AUDFs support to the UPA.         
	Though the minority party, founded in 2005, won only the Dhubri seat from among the nine it contested, Ajmals conviction stems from its encouraging overall show  topping 27 Assembly segments and coming second and third in around 20 other seats  in the parliamentary elections.         
	We will be concentrating on these seats. We want to ensure whoever forms the government cannot ignore us. We are aiming at winning 30-35 seats in 2011, Ajmal said, adding if the trend holds, then the AUDF will play a crucial role in the formation of the next government.         
	Moreover, chief minister Tarun Gogoi after dismissing Ajmal as nobody till recently, had admitted that the AUDF was one of the factors that adversely affected the Congress prospects in the polls.         
	Ajmal stated that despite extending outside support to the UPA, the party would remain anti-Congress and anti-BJP in the state. There are no contradictions. We have parties like the NCP and RJD with similar strategies. The outside support to the UPA does not mean that we will merge or ally with the Congress. It is an acknowledgement of the nationwide mandate for the Congress, for stability and against communal forces. The day we feel the UPA is not living up to our expectations, we will withdraw the support, he said.         
	The AUDF supremo, accompanied by party MLA Aditya Langthasa, working president H.R.A. Choudhury and general secretary Baharul Islam, accused state minister Gautam Roy of murdering democracy in Karimganj. Ajmal said that Roy had rigged the polls hundred per cent and if the Election Commission does not act on its complaint within 45 days, it would move court.We were winning and then suddenly the Congress won. How is this possible? he asked.         
	Ajmal said the outside support was extended with an appeal to the UPA to address critical issues like flood and erosion, NRC update, influx, reservation of third and fourth grade government jobs for local candidates and early completion of the railway gauge conversion and the East West Corridor.

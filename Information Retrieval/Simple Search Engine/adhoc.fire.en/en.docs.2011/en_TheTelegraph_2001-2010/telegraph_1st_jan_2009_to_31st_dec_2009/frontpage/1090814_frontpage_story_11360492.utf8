	Ranchi, Aug. 13: Seven legislators, including three former ministers, today lost the membership of the Assembly under the anti-defection law, as Speaker Alamgir Alam delivered a long-awaited verdict that means little at a time when the House is under suspended animation and the state is awaiting fresh elections by the end of the year.        
	The MLAs who have been axed are former ministers Kamlesh Singh, Anosh Ekka and Bhanu Pratap Sahi, BJP MLAs Ravindra Rai, Kunti Singh, and Manohar Tekriwal and Congresss Thomas Hansda.        
	However, Alam let off two MLAs  Bandhu Tirkey and Sudesh Mahto (both former ministers)  who also faced action under the Tenth Schedule of the Constitution.         
	The cases filed against Stephen Marandi, Pradeep Yadav and Vishnu Bhaiya were declared infructuous, as they had already submitted their resignations.         
	Stephen was charged with joining Babulal Marandis Jharkhand Vikas Mocha (P) after contesting elections as an Independent.         
	Tirkey came under the scanner for winning the elections on a UGDP ticket, but later forming the Jharkhand Janadhikar Manch while Mahto was charged with forming Ajsu Party, though he had won the election on an Ajsu ticket.        
	The Speaker found Ekka guilty of violating the Jharkhand Partys directive of not joining the Arjun Munda government. Singh was also guilty of violating a similar whip issued by the National Congress Party.

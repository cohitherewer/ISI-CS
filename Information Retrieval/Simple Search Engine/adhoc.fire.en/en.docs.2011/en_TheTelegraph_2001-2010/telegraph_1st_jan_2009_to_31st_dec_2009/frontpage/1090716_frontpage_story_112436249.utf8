                        (Top) Miscreants set fire to a bus during a road blockade on Howrah Bridge on Thursday. Traffic came to a standstill due to the blockade. (PTI)      Calcutta, 16 July : It was a bandh like situation in Calcutta and its adjoining district on Thursday. Congress workers took to the streets as early as 9AM in the morning. Armed with flags and shouting slogans their first target was the Gariahat crossing where a group of two hundred Youth Congress workers set a WBSTC bus on fire.   The group then moved towards the Lansdowne-Minto Park crossing where another government faced their ire.  quot;A group of two hundred odd people carrying Congress flags came from the southern direction. As soon as they reached the crossing they turned violent. They surrounded a government bus and ordered the 25 odd passengers to disembark. They then put the bus on fire, quot; said Gautam Chatterjee, a private firm employee who was waiting for a taxi at the Lansdowne-Minto Park crossing. Till 2PM the traffic in entire South Calcutta was in a standstill position due to road blockades at Hazra Crossing, Rashbehari Crossing, Jadubabu Bazar and Jadavpur.   Around 150 supporters of Congress put up a blockade near College square at around 12.30 PM for an hour. After police persuasion, the group cleared the stretch and headed towards Sealdah flyover.  Once they reached Sealdah, a group of men started throwing bricks aiming a CTC bus but missed it. Soon, another CTC bus arrived and the mob stopped it and rained bricks at the bus. A group of men and women picked up the road dividers and started demolishing the bus and smashing the windshields. Another CSTC bus which tried to race past it was also stopped by the supporters and given similar treatment.  At SN Banerjee road, around 2.00 PM, a group of around 100 supporters organised a procession and burnt effigy of the Chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharya outside the CMC building. Later they came to the Esplanade crossing and blocked it for around 20 minutes and then moved towards Rani Rashmoni Avenue.  According to police, five buses were set ablaze and seven were damaged during the course of today's violent protest in and around the city.   A scuffle between the policemen and protestors took place on Belvedere Road, in front of Bhawani Bhawan in Alipore. They even tried to enter the premises of Bhawani Bhawan, the building that houses a number of offices of several departments, including Criminal Investigation Department (CID), but police resisted them.   A 12 hour state-wide bandh has been declared from 6 AM tomorrow by PCC (Pradesh Congress Committee).

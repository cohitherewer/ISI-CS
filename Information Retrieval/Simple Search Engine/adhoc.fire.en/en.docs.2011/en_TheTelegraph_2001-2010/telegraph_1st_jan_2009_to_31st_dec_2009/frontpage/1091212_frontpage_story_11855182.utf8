                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                Birthday bonhomie melts House rancour
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      Pranab Mukherjee                          
	New Delhi, Dec. 11: Mock one day, hug the next.        
	Pranab Mukherjees 74th birthday today provided a rare glimpse into the personal bonhomie binding some of the nations senior-most leaders despite deep political differences as the Lok Sabha briefly transformed into the veterans birthday party.         
	Using a five-minute adjournment, L.K. Advani, Sushma Swaraj, Lalu Prasad and Gurudas Dasgupta briefly crossed the well of the House to enter the territory of the treasury benches.        
	Badhai ho aapko (Congratulations to you), said Advani, extending an outstretched hand to a visibly moved Mukherjee, seated in the front row of the treasury benches as leader of the House.         
	Advani was followed by a stream of MPs across party lines, including almost every present Congress member, in greeting the finance minister, who had a red rose tucked in his coats breast pocket.         
	Dada, Happy Birthday, bhishon bhalo (very good), the BJPs Sushma Swaraj said, testing her Bengali as she hugged a by-now beaming Mukherjee.         
	Only a few days back, Swaraj appeared to be mocking Mukherjee after he lost his cool in the Rajya Sabha following an interruption by CPM leader Brinda Karat.         
	Swaraj had suggested that increasing blood pressure because of his age could be the reason behind Mukherjee losing his temper.         
	Mukherjee had  eyes locked with Advanis  accused the BJP of politicising the 26/11 Mumbai attack earlier this session. You tried to politicise the attacks earlier. You were paid back in your own coin. Now you are trying to politicise this again. You will again be paid back in your own coin, a fuming Mukherjee had said after Advani suggested the government was failing to ensure that promised compensation reached the victims.         
	Over the past four days in Parliament, the BJP and the Congress have been locked in bitter combat over the Liberhan committee report on the Babri Masjid demolition.         
	But the acrimony was missing today, as Lalu Prasad  who has been absent for most of the session  and Gurudas Dasgupta  ridiculed by Pranab during a debate just days earlier  walked up to congratulate the veteran.         
	References to Mukherjees birthday began even before the adjournment. Demanding heritage city status for Amritsar, city BJP MP Navjot Singh Sidhu asked the government to concede his demand as it was Mukherjees birthday.        
	BJP MP Uday Singh, and then Swaraj, also referred to the ministers birthday to try and cajole the government into acceding to the Amritsar demand.

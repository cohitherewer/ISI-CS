The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Dutt forgives sis, stands by brother
                                                                                                           Dutt forgives sis, stands by brother
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      Amar  Singh  at  the  news  conference. (PTI)                          
	Mumbai, Jan 16: Sanjay Dutt couldnt turn down elder brother Amar Singh and decided to contest on a Samajwadi Party ticket, but he remains as close as ever to his little sister Priya Dutt and the Nehru-Gandhis.        
	I have forgiven my little sister, the actor told a news conference, referring to the Congress MPs alleged criticism of him and his wife Maanyata over his decision.        
	I am close to the Gandhi family, he added. They can call me whenever they need me.        
	After all, he explained, the Samajwadis were friends with the Congress, whom they had bailed out of a crisis after the Left withdrew support.        
	Besides, Amar Singh is my elder brother; I cant refuse his offer, Sanjay said, turning to the Samajwadi general secretary who sat by his side, head swathed in bandages after suffering an injury in Gorakhpur yesterday.        
	He then returned to the sister. She (Priya) has issued a clarification (denying certain comments), Sanjay said, adding he would forgive her even if she said something.        
	I am the eldest in the family and I need not ask anyone for my decisions. There are no differences in the family. Arguments happen between every brother and sister.        
	Sanjay, who had been shooting in Jammu and Kashmir for the past few days, returned home to Mumbai today to confirm he would be the Samajwadi candidate from Lucknow in the Lok Sabha polls.        
	Why Lucknow? This time Amar provided the sentimental answer: because Lucknow had provided Sanjays father Sunil Dutt his first job, with All India Radio, before he made it to Mumbai and made a career in films. Sunil had been Union minister in a Congress government, and Sanjays mother Nargis a Congress Rajya Sabha MP.        
	Sanjay said: I have taken legal advice and will appeal for suspension of my sentence before the Supreme Court. If Navjot Sidhu can contest the elections, so can I.        
	The actor was sentenced to a six-year term in the 1993 Bombay blasts case but is out on bail and has challenged his conviction in the Supreme Court. A jailed convict cant contest polls but a stay on conviction or sentence will remove the difficulty, as it had for former cricketer Sidhu.        
	Amar denied reports that Maanyata would contest if the court refused Sanjays plea. Maanyata was never considered as a candidate, he said.        
	Sharp family differences had surfaced after Amar announced Sanjays name as party candidate last week. Priya, MP for North West Mumbai, expressed shock.        
	Media reports quoted her as saying that Sunil Dutt would have been pained if he were alive since the family had always been Congress loyalists. The report said Priya had accused Maanyata of exploiting Sanjay to further her ambitions.        
	A day later, Priya said she was misquoted and that there was no feud in the family. But she expressed disappointment at her brothers decision to contest on a Samajwadi ticket.

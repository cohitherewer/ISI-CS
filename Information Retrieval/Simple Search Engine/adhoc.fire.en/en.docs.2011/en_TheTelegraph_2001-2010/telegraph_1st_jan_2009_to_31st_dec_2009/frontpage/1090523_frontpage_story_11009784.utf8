	New Delhi, May 22: After the euphoria of an unexpected electoral surge, a truncated beginning nailed to predictable political compulsions rather than innovation.        
	Manmohan Singh may yet reveal fresh flair and talent when Chapter Two of his team takes oath next week, but the Prime Minister began his second innings at Rashtrapati Bhavan this evening belying more than he inspired.         
	Eight of the 20 who took oath today come from the Rajya Sabha, reflecting a continuing bias for the Upper House, made of Elders not directly elected by the people, in government even though the Congress has swelled its Lok Sabha tally.        
	There is no minister from Uttar Pradesh, where the party made a stunning recovery and which is to be heir apparent Rahul Gandhis karmabhoomi. There are no new recruits from the meritocracy that the Prime Minister was believed to be keen on. Indeed, the cabinet so far is more reflective of classical Congress-style accommodation, less of a Prime Minister breaking fresh ground.        
	Manmohan Singh pulled on board two new faces  former Karnataka chief minister S.M. Krishna and Rajasthan Congress chief C.P. Joshi, considered Rahuls pick  and jettisoned three from his old team  the embittered Arjun Singh, who had made a late claim for retention, mines minister Sis Ram Ola and, against widely held assumption, law minister Hans Raj Bharadwaj, considered a loyalist who has privately been claiming his seat was assured.         
	Anand Sharma, who comes from Himachal where the Congress fared poorly, was elevated, as was B.K. Handique from Assam. But in sum, todays team was an aggregation of those who had picked themselves.         
	Within the Congress, though, few have been surprised and many took an understanding view of the choices made. As one senior partyman said: It is too much to expect established leaders to be broomed out just because they come from the Rajya Sabha, wait, the Lok Sabha will dominate the second swearing-in.         
	Todays exercise has left several obvious regional and social sectors awaiting representation. Uttar Pradesh is the most glaring of them but Bihar, where too the Congress is seeking to make a political comeback, may get more than just the symbolic, and politically lightweight, Meira Kumar. Gujarat and Haryana, both states where the Congress did better than expected, have no ministerial berths yet. Neither does anyone from the Scheduled Tribes category.                premier 20

Veerappa Moily    S. Jaipal Reddy    Kamal Nath    Vayalar Ravi    Meira Kumar    Murli Deora    Kapil Sibal    Ambika Soni    B.K. Handique    Anand Sharma    C.P. Joshi          
	Besides, there is only one Muslim and one Christian  both, but especially the former, are likely to claim a greater share. The minorities, especially in the northern heartland, have shown a willingness to return to the Congress fold in the recent elections, and the party will want to consolidate that trend by giving them greater representation, sources indicated.         
	GeNext MPs  many of whom were handpicked by Rahul and won against odds  are expected to get more than a mere quota-filling share. Apart from Jyotiraditya Scindia and Jitin Prasada, who were part of the last government, Sachin Pilot and Milind Deora are also being spoken of as ministerial prospects.         
	If the Congress is holding back surprises at the cabinet-level  ranks from Uttar Pradesh are particularly anxious  the party leadership is probably still mulling on who they should be. Indeed, those that have been left out today, or fear missing out in the next round as well, are lobbying hard to find their way in.        
	There is also the issue of finding a suitable and agreeable slot for the National Conference leader Farooq Abdullah, who left for South Africa to be at the final matches of the IPL today.         
	Abdullah was miffed that he had got no attention last evening in the midst of the hoopla over the DMK, but the Prime Minister spoke to him late night.         
	Abdullah boarded his flight seeming well placated and saying the world wont end if he took oath a day or two later. He is scheduled back in time for next weeks ceremony that is intended to complete Manmohan Singhs team.         
	The DMKs intransigence, which seemed to break as the swearing-in ceremony got underway, ensured that the Prime Minister was in no position to allocate portfolios even to the A team; that exercise is likely to be finalised once the second round of oath-taking is done with.        
	Even so, speculation over some allocations is firming  finance for Pranab Mukherjee, home for P. Chidambaram, defence for A.K. Antony, external affairs for S.M. Krishna or Kamal Nath, railways for Mamata Banerjee, agriculture for Sharad Pawar, human resource development for Kapil Sibal, petroleum for Murli Deora and information and broadcasting for Anand Sharma.        
	But party leaders involved with backroom decision-making were cautious and circumspect. Hectic discussions are still on, and demands from allies, particularly the DMK, still have to be kept in mind. Very little has been firmed up, one senior Congress leader said. The final decision will lie with Soniaji and the Prime Minister.

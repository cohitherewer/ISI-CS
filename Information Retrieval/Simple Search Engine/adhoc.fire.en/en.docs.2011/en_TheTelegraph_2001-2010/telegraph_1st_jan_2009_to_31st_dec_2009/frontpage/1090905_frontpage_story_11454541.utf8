  - Suicides, heart attacks cause alarm        G.S. RADHAKRISHNA                                    
	Hyderabad, Sept. 4: The tragic demise of Y.S. Rajasekhar Reddy has set off a bizarre trail of death in Andhra Pradesh with at least 133 people perishing either by committing suicide or from cardiac arrests apparently triggered by fear that the welfare schemes on offer would all be withdrawn.        
	Official sources said 94 people had succumbed to cardiac arrest in the state since yesterday afternoon. The sources, quoting family members of those who have died, said the majority of them were Reddys admirers who collapsed from shock.        
	At least 39 people have committed suicide either by hanging themselves or consuming poison. Reddy, who was given a state funeral today, was buried at his farm estate of Idupulapaya in Kadapa district.         
	Osmania Government Hospital authorities, quoting last weeks figures, said that on an average, 54 people died of cardiac arrest every day across the state. Andhra is also known for suicides by debt-ridden farmers with an average of four deaths reported every day.        
	The death spiral prompted YSRs son Y.S. Jaganmohan Reddy to issue an appeal to the people, the third since yesterday.         
	My father died working for the betterment of all of you. Dont let his efforts go waste by committing suicide, Jagan said in a TV appeal.        
	The reasons for the deaths ranged from hero-worship to fear of withdrawal of YSRs schemes such as pension for the aged and widows, free power to farmers, free healthcare to BPL card-holders and rural housing subsidy.        
	In Hyderabad, bank employee N. Suresh Kumar, 47, hanged himself after leaving a note that he was unable to conceive a state without YSR.         
	Yadigiri, 42, who had recently received an Arogyasri card entitling him to free healthcare, collapsed of heart attack after watching news of YSRs death.         
	In Krishna district, J. Maddiramayya, 55, died of shock as he had just got his kneecap operated under the Arogyasri scheme. In Prakasham district, adjoining the Rudrakonda hillock where YSRs helicopter crashed, 30-year-old K. Chinavelugonda Rao hanged himself fearing he would not get the last instalment of funds under the Indiramma rural housing subsidy scheme.         
	In Adilabad, Gavvala Buchaiyya, 70, and Ramakka, 60, jumped from a bridge. We felt desperate after learning of the death of our Rajanna (elder brother, though YSR was 60) who gave us pensions, they said in a note.         
	The largest number of deaths was in Warangal town where 17 people perished, among them nine suicides.         
	Reports from the districts said at least 100 more attempted suicide.         
	The government assured the people the schemes would continue. We will continue all programmes of YSR and people have nothing to be scared of, agriculture minister Raghuveera Reddy said.         
	Psychiatrists have labelled the deaths fatalistic suicides, which appear to have sprung from a unique socio-cultural milieu that seems to be shared by Tamil Nadu. They said such suicides occur in certain social environments when individuals believe there is no way their lives can improve.         
	Its an impulsive action, an escape from perceived trauma, the result of an inability to rationalise a loss, said M. Phani Prasant, a consultant psychiatrist in Hyderabad.                     WITH INPUTS FROM G.S. MUDUR

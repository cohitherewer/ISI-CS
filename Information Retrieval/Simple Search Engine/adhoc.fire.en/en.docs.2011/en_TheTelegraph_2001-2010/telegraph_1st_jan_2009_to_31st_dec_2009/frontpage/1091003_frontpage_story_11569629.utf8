The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Siliguri finger at adamant Mamata
                                                                                                           Siliguri finger at adamant Mamata
          BARUN GHOSH                      Mamata Banerjee                          
	Calcutta, Oct. 2: Mamata Banerjees intransigence, more than Deepa Das Munshis manoeuvres, ruptured the alliance in Siliguri, senior Trinamul leaders said today.        
	They felt that the party could have accepted the Congresss offer of a last-minute compromise to avert the spat over the mayors post in the Siliguri Municipal Corporation.        
	The Congress confirmed that such an offer was made. Darjeeling district Congress president Shankar Malakar revealed that he had rushed to local Trinamul leader Gautam Debs residence hours before the election yesterday with a two-pronged formula.         
	First, the Congress was ready to part with the posts of deputy mayor and the chairperson, five mayor-in-council portfolios and two borough chiefs, provided the demand for the mayors post was dropped.         
	Second, both Trinamul and the Congress could share power for two-and-a-half years each during the five-year tenure of the Siliguri civic board along the lines of the Jammu and Kashmir formula fashioned in 2002. According to this formula, Trinamul would have had its mayor for two-and-a-half years, while the Congresss mayor would have been at the helm for the remaining period.         
	But Trinamul refused everything proposed by us and remained firm on its demand for the mayors post. Against this backdrop, we were left with no option but to sound out the Left for support to form a stable civic board, said Raiganj MP Deepa, who has been associated with the political events in Siliguri since September 15 when the civic poll results were announced.        
	It was Deepa who had persuaded Bengal Congress president Pranab Mukherjee and AICC general secretary K. Keshava Rao, in charge of Bengal affairs, to accept the deal in which we were forced to approach the Left councillors.        
	It would have been suicidal had we meekly surrendered the mayors post to buy peace with Trinamul. Unlike in south Bengal, we deserve to be recognised as a force more formidable than Trinamul in the north because our traditional strong base is there, said a PCC functionary in Calcutta.         
	The Congress leaders observations found an echo in a section of the Trinamul leadership as well. These leaders felt that the acceptance of the Congresss offer would have sent a positive message about Mamata to the people of Siliguri who voted for the alliance.         
	Today, we are pointing fingers at the Congress for seeking the Lefts support. But as the principal Opposition, we should not have shunned our responsibility to keep the alliance intact by accommodating the Congresss last-minute formula. A gesture to honour an alliance partner could have improved our image at a time we are getting ready to tie up with the Congress in the approaching elections, a Trinamul central minister said.        
	The minister was referring to the November bypolls to 10 Assembly seats and next years polls to 82 civic bodies, including the Calcutta Municipal Corporation.        
	A Trinamul general secretary appeared more vocal than the minister.         
	In an alliance, it cannot be a one-way traffic all the time. Didi feels that her writ will be enforced everywhere across Bengal but this is not possible if we are serious about taking the alliance forward till the 2011 Assembly polls, he said.        
	However, it is unlikely that any of these leaders, none of whom was willing to go on record, will muster the courage to articulate their views in front of Mamata who spent the day in Delhi, refusing to meet Congress leaders.        
	Mamata is expected to fly to Siliguri from Delhi on Sunday to address a public rally there to publicly apologise for not being able to form the civic board. The first round of apology was delivered today by Trinamul leader Partha Chatterjee in Siliguri.        
	An unexplained factor in the Siliguri coup is how Deepa prevailed upon Mukherjee to give the green signal to go on the offensive.        
	A section of Congress leaders have been saying that Mamatas decision to offer tickets to nine Congress dissidents in the October 13 elections in Arunachal Pradesh did not go down well with the Congress leadership.        
	Pranabda, who has always made himself available to Mamatas programmes, is upset at the way Mamata decided to honour Congress dissidents in Arunachal Pradesh, a state Congress leader said.        
	It is not clear whether the ticket allocation also played a decisive role but Congress sources said it could have added to the tension building up over earlier snubs delivered by Mamata.

	Jaipur, Aug. 18: Rajasthan High Court today banned commercial activities in Amer Fort and termed illegal a special renovation committee, serving another jolt to a beleaguered Vasundhara Raje who was instrumental in forming the panel.        
	The court also issued showcause notices to the Union tourism secretary as central funds of Rs 30.61 crore were given for the renovation, restoration and protection of the fort, protected by the state since 1968.         
	The court held that the Amer Development and Management Authority, registered by Raje when she was the Rajasthan chief minister, was illegally assigned the task to manage the fort, including granting licences for commercial activities.        
	The order has come at a time when Raje is facing pressure from within the BJP to quit as the leader of the Opposition in the Assembly.        
	A PIL was filed in the high court after a part of the forts wall broke off during the shooting of the Salman Khan-starrer Veer on February 13. The PIL sought a ban on commercial activities in the fort.        
	The court said the work illegally assigned to the Amer development authority should have been carried out either by the director, archaeology, or an official not below the rank of collector, only if a specific notification was issued by the state government.

          AMIT ROY                            Aishwarya Rai Bachchan at Cannes. (Reuters)                                  
	Cannes, May 14: Abhishek Bachchan did the honours at the opening of the Indian pavilion in Cannes today but his wife did not come.        
	It was an occasion when a senior official of the Cannes Film Festival promised that very soon films from India would be among the 20 which are picked annually for competition from the thousands submitted from all over the world  this year there is none and there has not been one for a very long time.        
	This error will be put right quickly, pledged Christian Jeune, deputy general delegate from the Cannes Film Festival.        
	He told an audience that included well-known figures from the Indian film industry  they included Subhash Ghai, Deepti Naval, Amit Khanna and Bobby Bedi  that the Cannes authorities were delighted that Indias presence at the festival was growing year by year.         
	We are pleased to have a very big delegation from India  we hope soon we will show films from India in the official competition, he said.        
	Jeune added that Indian participation was very encouraging and positive and we need to have Indian films from India as part of the official selection.         
	At the government-to-government level, France appears determined to strengthen its artistic and cultural engagement with India.        
	Businessman Prakash Hinduja revealed that French President Nicolas Sarkozy was due to visit India as part of the Bonjour India festival of French arts and culture. He would probably attend a function in Agra  where he had to go alone last time because the Indian protocol department was not sure it should allow him to share a bedroom with Carla Bruni to whom the French President was then not married.        
	A French diplomat in India, Patrice Vanoni, said Bonjour India would take place across eight cities in India from December 2, 2009, to January 15, 2010. Bonjour India will tighten the cultural knots between France and India, Vanoni said told The Telegraph.        
	Hinduja had complained that Indian films were not getting into competition at Cannes and suggested that the festival authorities would offer India some guidance on how the problem could be solved.        
	When Ghai was invited to address the audience as a senior representative of Bollywood, Abhishek cut in: Indian film industry!         
	He and his wife Aishwarya walked the red carpet yesterday as did Sharmila Tagore, but while the latter was there as a member of the jury, the former Miss World now promotes the French cosmetics firm LOreal.

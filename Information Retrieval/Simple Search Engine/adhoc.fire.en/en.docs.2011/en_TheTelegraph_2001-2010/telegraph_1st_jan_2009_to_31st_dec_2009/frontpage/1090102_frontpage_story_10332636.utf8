The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Bonus squeeze on Citi
                                                                                                           Bonus squeeze on Citi
          ERIC DASH AND LOUISE STORY                            Vikram Pandit                                  
	New York, Jan. 1: Wall Street is hitting its bankers where it hurts  in the wallet.        
	Citigroups chief executive and chairman said on Wednesday they would forgo their bonuses for 2008 and slash the amounts paid to other senior bankers, joining a growing list of financial executives who are passing up some pay.        
	In a memo to bank employees, Vikram S. Pandit, Citigroups India-born chief executive who took over in December 2007, said he and Winfried F.W. Bischoff, the banks chairman, would not take year-end rewards.         
	The harsh realities of 2008, primarily our earnings results, mean that our bonus pool is dramatically lower than last year, Pandit wrote about a year in which the bank has so far announced more than $10 billion (Rs 48,000 crore) in losses. The most senior leaders should be affected the most.        
	But Pandits remarks may strike some as several weeks late, if not a few million dollars short. Citigroup, one of the biggest recipients of taxpayer money, has taken in $45 billion in capital from the governments bailout funds.        
	Nearly every chief executive on Wall Street has indicated that he will decline a 2008 bonus, with Kenneth D. Lewis of Bank of America and John Stumpf of Wells Fargo being the holdouts so far.         
	Other banks have clamped down on pay even more than Citigroup under pressure from Congress, regulators and investors.         
	Wachovia, for example, said it was slashing compensation not just in the executive suite, but all the way down through its ranks.         
	Whats different about this year versus last year is that the US taxpayer is part of the equation, so how things appear is important, said Rakesh Khurana, a professor at Harvard Business School.        
	On Wall Street, compensation is always a hot button. But now the tension is heightened: pay too much and risk a political backlash; pay too little and risk losing talented employees. The prospect of losing workers to hedge funds and private equity firms has helped drive up pay in the industry in past years.        
	The argument is always made about this excessive compensation, that its necessary to keep these people, said Richard Cellini, a senior vice-president at Integrity Interactive, a consulting firm in Waltham, Massachusetts. That will now be tested, and Im not sure if theres anywhere for them to go.        
	Many banks, like Citigroup, are making the biggest reductions to their senior executives pay. Bonuses at the top of Citigroup will be down at least 40 per cent for 10 members of its senior leadership team, according to a corporate filing released on Wednesday.

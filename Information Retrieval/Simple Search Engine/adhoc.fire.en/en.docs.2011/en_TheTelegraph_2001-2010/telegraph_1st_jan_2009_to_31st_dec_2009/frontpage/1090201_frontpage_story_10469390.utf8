The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Poll boss guns for colleague
                                                                                                           Poll boss guns for colleague
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                      Chawla, Gopalaswami                                  
	New Delhi, Jan. 31: The Centre is faced with a situation without parallel after chief election commissioner N. Gopalaswami recommended to the President that his colleague, Navin Chawla, be sacked for alleged partisanship.         
	The President has forwarded the letter to the Prime Minister, who is in hospital after a heart surgery.        
	This is the first time a chief election commissioner has sought the removal of an election commissioner.        
	Gopalaswamis action, reported in The Hindu today, surprised the political establishment which questioned its timing  just ahead of the general election.        
	Chawla ruled out resigning. Why should I? he said. Asked what he would do next, the election commissioner said: We have to conduct the general election and must continue to work in that direction.        
	The 15th general election is expected to be held in April-May 2009. Gopalaswami retires on April 20 and is unlikely to be able to oversee the entire exercise. Chawla, the next in seniority on the three-member panel, will succeed him.        
	The Centre is expected to react to Gopalaswamis recommendation only after Prime Minister Manmohan Singh returns from hospital and can sit through long meetings.        
	Singh, sources said, will probably be home by Monday but it will be a while before he can work long hours. Given the legal and political complexities involved, the issue is unlikely to top his official agenda now.        
	Union minister Kapil Sibal, on whom the Congress relies for politico-legal issues, is out of the country till Monday.         
	The issue will be examined and the governments response will be made available in due course, foreign minister Pranab Mukherjee said.         
	PMO sources directed queries on the letter to the law ministry. But law minister H.R. Bharadwaj refused to speak.        
	The controversy goes back to March 2006 when L.K. Advani approached the President seeking Chawlas removal. The BJP levelled a series of allegations, ranging from linking him to Emergencys excesses to his association with Sonia Gandhi. When nothing came of the petition and another one before the Supreme Court, the BJP approached Gopalaswami in January 2008.        
	However, Gopalaswami has said his recommendation is based on his own assessment of Chawlas conduct in office.         
	Government sources said their case would rest on two factors: the legal and constitutional opaqueness of whether the recommendation is binding since experts are divided; and that under the Constitution, the President does not act on her own but on the advice of the council of ministers.

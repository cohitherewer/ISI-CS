The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Pandemic label on swine flu
                                                                                                           Pandemic label on swine flu

	June 11: The World Health Organisation (WHO) today labelled the pattern and scale of spread of the new influenza virus as a full global pandemic, the first one in 41 years, raising its six-point alert phase to its highest level.         
	The previously unseen H1N1 type of flu virus that appeared to flare up in Mexico in April this year has spread to 74 countries, infected more than 28,000 persons and caused 144 deaths, according to figures released tonight.         
	The WHO declared pandemic level 6 amid growing evidence of community-level spread and outbreaks of the H1N1 swine flu virus in several regions of the world, including the US and Australia.         
	The world is moving into the early days of its first influenza pandemic in the 21st century, Margaret Chan, director-general of the WHO told a news conference in Geneva this evening. The last flu pandemic of 1968-69 had claimed nearly one million lives worldwide, according to medical literature. Chan said todays move reflected only the geographic spread of the virus but did not indicate the severity of the pandemic. She said the WHOs global assessment was that the pandemic was moderate. She said the WHO did not recommend closing borders and added that there should not be any restrictions on the movement of people, goods or services.         
	Senior Indian health officials said the declaration of a pandemic would not change their current day-to-day activities aimed at trying to contain the infection wherever it is detected and to recognise clusters of infection if they emerge.         
	India has so far detected 15 cases of H1N1 flu, 13 in persons who had returned from abroad. But at least two people have picked up the infection locally from relatives who were infected abroad.         
	We have had very few cases and may still have an opportunity to contain it, Vishwa Mohan Katoch, director-general of the Indian Council of Medical Research, said. It will depend on how quickly people report to us after symptoms.         
	Some health experts said the pandemic declaration could have come weeks earlier but the agency became bogged down by politics. In May, several countries urged the WHO not to declare a pandemic, fearing it would cause social and economic turmoil.         
	Michael Osterholm, a senior influenza expert at the University of Minnesota, had told The Telegraph in early May this year that the pattern and speed of spread of the virus should warrant an upgradation to pandemic level.        
	This is WHO finally catching up with the facts, Osterholm, a flu expert at the University of Minnesota, was today quoted by the Associated Press as saying.         
	Here in the United States, weve been reacting as though we were in a pandemic already, in terms of our intensive efforts to prepare individuals and respond as a nation, said Anne Schuchat, director of the US National Centre for Immunisation and Respiratory Disease.         
	Although the illness from H1N1 has been mild with symptoms of cold and fever in the vast majority of infected people in most countries, except in Mexico, experts are still worried about deaths. About half the people who have died from H1N1 infection have been previously healthy. This is one of the observations that has given us the most concern, said Keiji Fukuda, assistant director general of the WHO in Geneva. Scientists still dont know why those people died as opposed to many others who survived.         
	Scientists caution that it is still unclear how the virus will behave in different regions around the world. We do not know how the virus is going to evolve, Fukuda said. It could become more mild over time, it could become more severe over time, or it could stay pretty much as it is now. The Indian government had announced in early May that it would procure 10 million doses of the anti-viral drug oseltamivir and distribute it to all districts. The drug can reduce the severity of the illness and make people better faster.         
	The detection of a cluster (more than three to five transmissions from a single case) could prompt health authorities to introduce cluster containment steps -- restrict the movement of people in the neighbourhood of the cluster, provide anti-viral drugs to all people except infants in the neighbourhood, shut down schools, markets, and impose travel restrictions. quot;We would need intense community co-operation to handle this kind of infection -- before and after a cluster is detected, quot; a medical officer said.         
	Health experts said the pandemic declaration could serve as a fresh alert for countries -- such as India -- that have not yet experienced community-level spread to prepare for greater amounts of disease.         
	The declaration does not suggest that there has been any change in the behaviour of the virus, only that it is spreading in more parts of the world, said Thomas Frieden, director of the US Centres for Disease Control.         
	But, like WHOs Chan, Frieden said the pandemic did not mean the infection was getting more severe. This is not, at this point, a flu that is anywhere as severe as the 1918 pandemic, for example.         
	The 1918-19 Spanish Flu, that had killed 40 million to 100 million people worldwide, was among three flu pandemics that had struck humans during the 20th century.

	Wellington (New Zealand), July 22 (AP): Southern New Zealand has moved slightly closer to the east coast of neighbouring Australia as a result of a massive earthquake last week off the countrys South Island, a scientist said today.        
	The magnitude 7.8 quake, centred in the ocean near Resolution Island in the countrys Fiordland region, twisted South Island out of shape and moved its southern tip 30cm closer to Australia, seismologist Ken Gledhill said.         
	Gledhill, director of government-owned GNS Sciences GeoNe national earthquake monitoring project, said the islands geographic shift showed the immensity of the forces involved. Basically, its taken us closer to Australia, he told National Radio.        
	 The country is deforming all the time because of being on the plate boundary, but this has done it in a few seconds, rather than waiting hundreds of years.        
	Last Wednesdays quake was the largest in the world this year and New Zealands biggest in 80 years. No major damage has been found in the sparsely populated Fiordland region of South Islands west coast.        
	New Zealand has been very fortunate. This earthquake anywhere else would have caused huge damage, Gledhill said. He added that the quakes impact will provide invaluable information on the underlying structure of the country.        
	Martin Reyners, principal scientist for GNS Science, said earlier that a shallow temblor of such magnitude would typically cause widespread damage and loss of life.         
	Last weeks quake, however, occurred in soft rocks between two tectonic plates, muffling its power, he said.        
	A small tsunami was generated by the earthquake, with a tide gauge on the West Coast of New Zealand recording a wave of one metre. For a very large earthquake, there were very few areas that were severely shaken, Gledhill said.

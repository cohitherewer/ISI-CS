The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Dump or adapt: Indias aid ache
                                                                                                           Dump or adapt: Indias aid ache
          NISHIT DHOLABHAI                              
	New Delhi, Aug. 22: India is considering a proposal to jettison a World Bank development project if a decision to keep out Arunachal Pradesh, apparently under Chinese pressure, is not revoked.        
	The programme, called the Northeast Livelihood Project, is the latest to get caught in alleged Chinese misgivings about India pursuing welfare schemes in the northeastern state over which the two countries have a territorial dispute.        
	If the Indian government sticks to the view that Arunachal cannot be excluded, a similar programme will be taken up by the Planning Commission instead of the World Bank. The project, aimed at investing in self-help groups and generating employment opportunities in the Northeast, had originally envisaged an investment of $200 million (over Rs 960 crore).        
	So far, the World Bank has cleared the programme for only Sikkim, Tripura, Nagaland and Mizoram, citing constraints in supervisory capabilities in covering all eight states in the region.        
	But Indian sources said Chinese reservations were suspected to have played a role in truncating the project.        
	The minister for development of Northeastern Region, B.K. Handique, said: The World Bank approved the project for only four states, while we wanted all the Northeast states, including Arunachal, to be covered. So the government is asking the Planning Commission to do it.        
	The minister declined comment on a specific question if a China hand was being suspected but said with a laugh: Interesting that the Left-ruled Tripura was not left out.        
	Handique, however, added: We should not make a big ruckus about it and let it affect bilateral relations or the negotiations on the borders. We should exercise restraint.        
	We have told the Planning Commission to design an alternative scheme. But there is another view to retain the World Bank project and have a similar project for the other (four) states by the Planning Commission. We will consult Arunachal MPs before finalising anything, Handique said.        
	Arunachal Congress leaders are angered by repeated attempts by Beijing to prevent development funds from flowing into the state. They had tried it during the ADB funding also, but they could not succeed, said Congress MP Takam Sanjoy.        
	He was referring to Chinese attempts to prevent a $60-million project of Asian Development Bank (ADB) for the frontier state.        
	Beijings objections to the ADB project earlier this year fell through after all members, except China, voted to grant approval for the India plan. The Chinese foreign ministry was quoted as saying in June that the country was dissatisfied with the ADB adopting a document involving disputed territories.        
	Soon afterwards, the World Bank told Delhi that the livelihood programme could be approved only for two districts each in the four states.        
	Some officials in the Northeast ministry feel that India should exert pressure on the World Bank and persuade it to include Arunachal rather than pull out altogether.         
	The course of the negotiations and the outcome have assumed significance because China is now a key voice in global financial aid management, especially after promising $40 billion to the International Monetary Fund.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Zero tolerance of Maoists
                                                                                                           Zero tolerance of Maoists
  - Resources cause for concern          SANKARSHAN THAKUR                                                     
	New Delhi, Oct. 7: Congress general secretary Rahul Gandhi may yet be ready to attribute expanding Naxalism to governance failure, but the Centre has put a more blunt analysis on the challenge.        
	Delhi has set its teeth harder against armed Maoists and their sympathisers following the beheading of inspector Francis Indwar in Jharkhand.        
	They are ruthless criminals bent on defying authority with violence, their tactics have to be firmly met, a senior official said on the eve of a meeting of the cabinet committee on security (CCS), likely tomorrow.        
	The CCS will probably go beyond mere stock-taking of the current surge in Naxalite violence. Sources said a zero-tolerance directive would be sent out to affected states with an assurance that the Centre would provide all possible intelligence and resource assistance to meet the Maoist dare.        
	But the sources cautioned against putting a date or a timeline to the anti-Naxalite offensive, or even calling it one. Why use words like war and offensive? There is an internal security threat and the government is going to meet it with the power required to neutralise it. That is what governments are meant to do, preserve the safety and security of citizens, an official said.        
	He also put down speculation that the week after Diwali is when operations are likely to gather steam. There is no specific date on which some big operation is set to be launched, it is a developing situation, the engagement is happening even now wherever required, what may and will happen over time is that the scope of the engagement will become more comprehensive.        
	But the Centre and state governments are beset by substantive resource issues that have shackled the prospects of an effective fight-to-finish operation against the Naxalites, spread over nearly 40 per cent of the countrys territory.         
	The police-to-population ratio in none of the states comes even close to the recommended 222 per hundred thousand; the figure for Bengal, for instance, is 98; in Bihar it is as low as 57.        
	Most state forces are poorly armed, ill-trained and underfed. Poor intelligence and real-time information are a huge drawback; that the government has little penetration in Naxalite-dominated areas works as an additional squeeze on inputs.         
	Although exchange of intelligence has improved under Union home minister P. Chidambarams work ethic, co-operation and co-ordination levels between states and security agencies still dont meet requirements in the reckoning of experts.        
	Any major deployment or engagement with current capacity would be irrational, said Ajai Sahni, executive director of the Delhi-based Institute of Conflict Management. Until the government secures saturation in all areas, it would be madness, it would mean throwing our boys to the wolves. We dont even have good information about where they are and arent, what is mined, what is not.         
	Chidambaram, who recently changed tack to put barrelling into armed Maoists ahead of development imperatives, repeated his resolve to take on the Maoist war on the republic today.        
	He told a media conference in Mumbai: We have no option but to ask the security forces to engage the Maoists, apprehend them. Maoist violence has grown over the last 10-12 years. As long as Naxalites do not abjure violence the security forces will confront them, engage them. Chidambaram had reacted in grave tones to the brutal end of Jharkhands Indwar yesterday, calling it nothing short of cold-blooded murder, thats it, cold-blooded murder.         
	Fresh intelligence inputs  and on-ground activity  suggest that Naxalite cadres are in the process of melting away from their known strongholds and may be planning sporadic strikes on unsuspecting targets. This is their well-practised strategy, a source said. If they believe a major strike is impending, they will scatter and try to escalate violence in order to keep the forces occupied in skirmishes.         
	Naxalite-related violence has registered a new high this year and already claimed 765 lives compared to 638 dead in 2008 and 650 in 2007. Experts reckon the toll is likely to cross the thousand mark before the year is out.        
	Bengal, which is witnessing a fresh spate of Naxalism after a four-decade lull, has particular reason for concern. From seven deaths in Naxalite-related violence in 2007, the toll leaped to 24 in 2008 and has multiplied four times to 86 so far this year.        
	There has been lingering scepticism in Union home ministry circles about the state governments reluctance to formally ban the CPI (Maoist)  and, indeed, so-called front groups. But action taken over the past few days appears to have sent out the signal that the state government is more determined than before to meet the threat.         
	The sense, though, that violence will escalate is shared by the government, Naxalite mouthpieces and experts on the subject.        
	While Naxalite platforms  print propaganda and websites  are abuzz with the clamour of preparing to meet the war-mongering bourgeois state, the government itself has been articulating a new determination to meet Red terror through its internal security face, Chidambaram.         
	The state is newly clenched-fisted to confront them, and the Maoists are displaying no signs they are going to take things lying down, as their aggressive post-election document suggests. We may witness much more violence and many more deaths in the weeks and months to come, an independent expert on insurgency said.

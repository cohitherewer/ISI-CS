										      THE CLIMATE SUMMIT      No matter where you are, you cant get past the next 12 days without coming across Copenhagen. G.S. Mudur puts together a survival guide                                          
	Q: What is the Copenhagen conference?         
	The 15th UN sclimate change conference that opens in Copenhagen on Monday represents a deadline the world gave itself two years ago. It is a crucial meeting where 192 countries are expected to finalise strategies to reduce or limit emissions of Earth-warming carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases in the years beyond 2012 through different actions by industrialised countries and developing nations.         
	About 15,000 people  heads of state, ministers, diplomats, negotiators, scientists, representatives of non-government agencies, energy technology companies as well as climate-affected indigenous people from the Sunderbans, Alaska, Ethiopia, Equador and a dozen other places around the world  are expected to converge for the conference from December 7 -18.         
	Q: What is at stake?         
	The future of the planet and humankind.         
	Emission of greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide from the burning of fossil fuel for industry, power and transport, and other human activities such as deforestation are warming the planet. Scientists believe an average global temperature rise higher than 2C would lead to catastrophic climate changes. Sea level rise, crop losses from erratic weather, deaths, disease and even mass migrations as well as social upheavals are among the myriad predicted impacts.         
	Q: Who is responsible for greenhouse gas emissions?         
	The industrialised countries account for about 72 per cent of total carbon dioxide emissions that have accumulated in the atmosphere between 1950 and 2005. Between 1980 and 2005, emissions from the US were double those of China and seven times the emissions of India. But China and India are large emitters. Chinas absolute emissions are the highest in the world, and India is the fifth highest emitter.         
	Q: What is a per capita emission value?                   
	The per capita emission represents the average carbon footprint from each individual in a country. Although India is the fifth largest emitter, its per capita is about 1.2 tonnes a year  among the lowest in the world. This is because a vast proportion of Indias population still has no or poor access to energy or electricity. In contrast, the US per capita emission figure is about 20 times higher. In other words, an average American is responsible for emissions 20 times more than an average Indian.         
	Q: How can the emissions problem be solved?         
	Virtually all countries agree emissions must be reduced. But there is no consensus on how this is to be achieved. A landmark agreement that was hammered out in Kyoto, Japan, 12 years ago and followed up by an action plan in Bali, Indonesia, two years ago expects the industrialised countries to take on deep legally-binding emission cuts. Developing countries are also expected to act to limit growth of their emissions with finance and clean energy technologies from industrialised countries.         
	Q: What are the key points of disagreement?         
	The quantum of emissions cuts by industrialised countries between 2012 and 2020 and beyond. Should they be legally-binding international commitments? How much of international scrutiny would be available for voluntary actions by developing countries to limit emissions growth? How much finance would industrialised countries make available to help developing countries adapt to impacts of climate change and to pursue clean energy growth options?         
	Q: Is every country on its own or are there unofficial blocs?         
	Each country participates during the negotiations on its own. But shared interests and concerns have led to the emergence of blocs  the industrialised countries, the developing countries, the small island states. But differences in policies as well as statements of their intended action to combat climate change may vary even within such blocs. India is a member of a loose coalition of developing countries known as the G77  China also is part of this group  that has been demanding deep emissions cuts from the industrialised countries and funds and technology for clean energy growth.         
	Q: What outcomes will define success for the conference?                   
	Success may be measured through three key outcomes:         
	Industrialised countries accept deep legally-binding emissions reductions targets of 25 to 40 per cent below 1990 levels by the year 2020         
	Quantified voluntary actions to limit growth of emissions by large emitters such as China, India and Brazil         
	The industrialised countries must agree to provide funds to help the developing countries adapt to climate change, pursue clean-energy technology options, stop deforestation. The quantum of funds is still unclear, but some estimates put this at more than $100 billion a year. The UN Framework Convention on Climate Change chief, Yvo de Boer, has said he would like to see $10 billion on the table at Copenhagen. One negotiator has described this figure as pitiable.         
	Q: Will decisions be put to vote?         
	No. There is no vote. The negotiations are expected to generate a consensus agreement. In theory, any country can hold up the process. In practice, it is usually countries with economic or political clout that have the potential to frustrate progress in talks. Informal groups assigned thematic sections of the negotiating text discuss it line by line to arrive at a consensus. If there is no agreement on an item, the text passes on to a bigger group, and if even the bigger group cannot converge, it is passed on to the plenary session.         
	Q: Which decisions will be considered a breakthrough if they are taken?         
	An agreement under which all industrialised countries, the US included, accept deep legally-binding emissions reductions of 40 per cent below 1990 levels by 2020 would be a breakthrough. But virtually everyone agrees this is unlikely to happen.         
	Q: How do we know if the meeting is a flop?             WHY copenhagen      Any member nation may offer to host the annual   UN climate change conference.  The Danish minister for climate and energy,   Connie Hedegaard, initiated a series of international annual dialogues on climate change since 2005 mdash;   in Greenland, South Africa, Sweden, and Argentina mdash; each focused on the need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Denmark has also appointed five climate   attaches in its embassies in New Delhi, Moscow, 
  Washington DC, Brasilia and retoria. 
  By the time the 13th climate change conference   ended in Bali, 
  Indonesia, in 2007, Copenhagen had   already been picked as the site for the 15th conference after the 14th meeting in Poznan, Poland, in 2008. New Delhi had   hosted the 8th 
  conference   in 2002 
            
	A weak political statement affirming concerns about the climate but without legally-binding cuts on rich countries may be dubbed a failure. But any definition of success or failure would depend on who is being asked the question.         
	Hardcore environmental activists say the absence of deep legally-binding emissions cuts for the industrialised countries would imply the conference has flopped. But some climate policy analysts believe no agreement in Copenhagen would be better for the long-term than a weak agreement. In the absence of any agreement, they believe there would be scope for greater political mobilisation and a better agreement at some later date.         
	Q: What stand is India expected to take?         
	Indias consistent articulated position has been that industrialised countries, which are primarily responsible for the accumulated emissions, should take on the most responsibility. India believes long-term targets such as 80 per cent emissions reduction by 2050 are meaningless without interim targets for 2020. Delhi has also pledged it will not allow its per capita emissions to exceed those of the industrialised countries. This has led to the idealistic concept of per capita convergence  a global trend where per capita emissions of rich countries decline and the per capita emissions of developing countries increase and converge.         
	India has cited its domestic actions on climate change and its proposals to reduce its carbon emissions intensity as evidence that although it has not caused the problem, it is willing to be part of the solution.         
	Q: Who is representing India?         
	Prime Minister Manmohan Singh. An official delegation led by environment minister Jairam Ramesh will include the Prime Ministers special envoy Shyam Saran, a team of veteran Indian climate change negotiators  former ambassador Chandrasekhar Dasgupta, former environment secretary Prodipto Ghosh, environment ministry officials R.R. Rashmi and Jayant M. Mauskar.         
	For the first time, Indias official delegation will also include two high school students and two college students  to represent the generation that will experience the impacts of climate change in the decades to come. Five MPs  Murli Manohar Joshi, Bhartruhari Mahtab, Hamdulla Sayeed, M.S. Swaminathan and Sitaram Yechury  will also be part of the official delegation.         
	Q: Which world leaders would be there?         
	About 90 heads of state have expressed their intention to attend. Among them are Barack Obama, Gordon Brown, Nicolas Sarkozy and the heads of state of Australia, Brazil, Germany and Russia, among others.         
	Q: Arent Indian activists going?         
	A team from Indias Centre for Science and Environment, a non-government organisation that has been analysing and guiding policy on climate change for nearly two decades will attend the conference. A group of Greenpeace India activists would attend as observers. Fisherfolk from the Sunderbans, Bhil tribals from Madhya Pradesh and tribes from Orissa will represent indigenous people from India affected by climate change.         
	Q: Will there be public demonstrations or protests?         
	Greenpeace International has initiated public message campaigns  advertisements at Copenhagen airport, a ship named Beluga-II anchored near the airport with a giant banner seeking action to stop climate change, and a planet rescue station at the conference centre, a globe that may change colour from blue to red depending on how the conference proceeds.         
	Non-government networks will closely observe the negotiations.        
	Protests may become visible during the second week, particularly if the conference appears to be faltering.         
	Q: Do Indian political parties have a stand on the conference?         
	As the debate on climate change in Parliament last Thursday suggested, members of political parties appear sensitised to the reasons, implications and impact of climate change. There is consensus that India should not abandon its stand of demanding legally binding emissions cuts from industrialised countries. They also want India to pursue clean energy growth through voluntary action.         
	Q: Will the conference really affect lifestyles?         
	A successful outcome of the conference as defined earlier will certainly change lifestyles of people in the industrialised nations and the developing countries. Reducing emissions or limiting emissions growth may be achieved through multiple clean-energy initiatives. But many will come at a cost.         
	New energy efficient appliances may cost higher than low efficiency appliances. Consumers may have to bear the burden if the government doesnt subsidise such products. Large subsidies could eat into government finances with implication on overall government budgets. People may be coaxed to rely more on solar energy for lighting or heating water. In attempts to promote public transport, authorities may introduce penalties or charges for the use of private transport in crowded zones or during peak hours.         
	Q: Did the Kyoto Protocol live up to expectations?         
	The Kyoto Protocol, which emerged at a similar conference in December 1997, highlighted opportunities and difficulties in trying to achieve legally-binding targets. The US never accepted the Kyoto Protocol, insisting that large emitters such as China and India should also contribute to the emissions reductions process.         
	The protocol set a 5 per cent emissions reduction target for the industrialised countries during the first period of the protocol  up to 2012. In reality, the emissions have actually increased for many industrialised countries. US emissions have climbed 18 per cent between 1990 and 2006. Canadas emissions have risen by 22 per cent. But Germany, Sweden, and the UK are among countries that have reduced emissions.         
	Q: Is Copenhagen also expected to adopt a protocol?         
	The birth of a brand new Copenhagen Protocol without any of the key success elements defined above would be a failure of the climate change negotiating process. This is something India and other developing countries have been trying to prevent.  
	THE GREAT BATTLES   
	Developed vs developing  
	 This is where post-industrial economies like the US and   Europe, which became   prosperous by burning   carbon-dioxide-spewing   fossil fuels, face off against   industrialising economies   like China, Brazil and India,   which resent pressure to   decarbonise their energy   systems now that they are   growing   
	Coastal vs the clock  
	Should global warming raise sea levels, three-dozen or so other small island and coastal countries, such as the Maldives, could   become uninhabitable. As a bloc, these countries have been lobbying for an international agreement to keep average temperatures from rising beyond 1.5C. They also   want global emissions scaled   back by as much as   85 per cent by mid-century  
	Europe vs Europe  
	While Europe as a whole is on track to meet its goal of an 8 per cent reduction over 1990 emissions levels by 2012, not every country has pulled its weight.   Nations unlikely to meet their individual Kyoto targets include Italy, Spain and, yes, Denmark, host of the Copenhagen talks. Poland and Estonia, meanwhile, have been bickering with the European Commission over the amount of carbon dioxide the two countries should be allowed to emit. Both rely heavily on coal for electricity  
	Opec vs clean tech  
	 Oil-producing nations are worried about   the impact of a global climate deal, and   they have increasingly argued that any   agreement that would reduce reliance on   fossil fuels should include compensation   for their lost revenues. Saudi Arabia has spearheaded this argument.  
	 Developers of wind, solar and other   renewable technologies anticipate a windfall   if the community of nations agree to a binding climate treaty. So, too, do global banks, which would presumably do handsomely through   an expanded carbon trading market.						   
	 Lobbyists from all sides will be wining and dining delegates over the next two weeks.  
	Carbon taxers vs carbon traders  
	 Many experts argue that the only way to tackle climate change is to put a price on   carbon. Some say the best way to do that is   to create a cap-and-trade system, in which   industries are issued permits to emit carbon dioxide up to a certain level, or a cap.   Companies that emit below the cap can   then sell their permits on a carbon market, where companies exceeding the cap will,   presumably, buy them so they can continue  to pollute. The total number of permits would not exceed an overall emissions target.  
	 Some critics argue, however, that such   systems are unnecessarily complicated and prone to manipulation. A simpler solution would be a tax on carbon, they say  
	Emergency vs well figure it out  
	 The idea that humans are nudging the   planets thermostat upward is widely accepted among climatologists. But how rapidly things are changing, to what extent and where  and at what threshold, if any, should we abandon all hope  are far less settled questions.						   
	 Some argue that there is no reason for panic  nor for what they say is an   economy-crushing global climate treaty.   They are putting their faith in human ingenuity, arguing that planetary-scale engineering   projects like blasting seawater into the   atmosphere to increase the heat reflectivity   of certain clouds (yes, thats a real idea), will eventually solve the problem.

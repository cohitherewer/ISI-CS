	Darjeeling, Nov. 22: A Class XII student of Mount Hermon School here died after he and two of his friends fell off a rock face near Bhale Dunga this evening.        
	Black Rock is situated adjacent to the school and police said the trio had reached the top of the 40-foot high cliff-like structure by grappling along its slope on their hands and feet. It is normally the way would-be mountaineers climb. It is to be investigated how they fell off, an officer from the Sadar police station said.        
	Ram Sel Puia, the student who died, Lal Singh Hanam and Joelian, all from Mizoram, had been reported missing by the school authorities around 5.30pm after the trio failed to report to the hostel. Boarders are required to be back in hostel by 5pm, police said.        
	The three left the school after 3.30pm and probably without taking permission, the officer said. A source said the boys were scrambling down after they heard the dinner bell.         
	While the school authorities refused to answer any calls, the police said the local people had helped recover Puias body after one of the two lesser injured students raised the alarm. The body has been taken to the Sadar hospital for post-mortem, while the two injured have been admitted to Planters Hospital, the officer said.

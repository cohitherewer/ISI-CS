The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Privilege to work with Left 
                                                                                                           Privilege to work with Left 
  - Manmohan the politician keeps the pot boiling           RASHEED KIDWAI                            Singh, Karat                                       
	New Delhi, April 15: An economist-turned-politician had once said of the Prime Minister: Manmohan Singh may be the most over-rated economist but he is the most-underestimated politician.        
	The BJP and the Left might be wondering about the second half of that statement, as Manmohan gives L.K. Advani a taste of his own medicine and suggests he doesnt have a problem doing business with Prakash Karat with whom his government had a bitter parting not too long ago.        
	Asked today if he would be willing to seek the Lefts support to form the government after the elections, Manmohan said: Well, I think circumstances will decide. But I was quite happy when as government we were dealing with the Left.         
	The Prime Minister said the Left parties had strong views on the nuclear deal and had to leave, but it (working with them) was a matter of great privilege.         
	CPM general secretary Karat, who had led the Left pullout over the nuclear deal in July 2008, ruled out another alliance. There is no chance of an understanding with the Congress. We are working for a non-Congress non-BJP government, he said.        
	In Deshabhimani, the party mouthpiece in Kerala, which goes to the polls tomorrow and where the Left is pitted against the Congress, Karat launched an attack on the Prime Minister for saying in a campaign speech that the CPM had always been on the wrong side of history.         
	For him, being on the right side of history means being with the United States of America, Karat wrote. He also accused the government of buying the support of MPs during the July 2008 trust vote, forced by the Left pullout.        
	But his politburo colleague M.K. Pandhe set a condition for teaming up with the Congress again: They will have to withdraw from the nuclear deal first. (Only then) can we discuss a post-poll understanding.        
	CPIs D. Raja complained that Manmohan made the nuclear deal his personal agenda and clarified that his partys differences with the Prime Minister were over policies.        
	Manmohan gave no suggestion that he had changed his mind on the nuclear deal. He told a meeting with members of the Editors Guild today that it would have been disastrous to scrap the deal after we had resolved all issues to Indias satisfaction through three years of negotiation.        
	Indias honour was at stake, he said, repeating what he has said several times in the past, after he first told the Left in August 2007 that they could withdraw support but he would not go back on the honourable deal.         
	Senior Congress leaders were happy with Manmohans comments not ruling out an alliance with Left and added the CPMs immediate reaction was only expected.         
	The significance of Manmohans remark is in the fact he has no issues vis--vis the Left. He is also not averse to talking and winning support, said a party functionary asking not to be identified.        
	The comments were carefully thought out and in keeping with the partys strategy to keep the communal forces at bay. It is not as if we are considering the Lefts support. It is a statement of intent that all is not lost with the Left and that we can be together to surmount a greater evil, he said.        
	Manmohan refused to comment when asked if the Congress would be willing to support the Left to form a third front government.         
	But the Prime Minister told the editors that regional parties  the third front is made up of them  could be an obstacle to the nations growth and said the country needed a party in power that had a national perspective.        
	Manmohan was then asked about his sharp response to Advani calling him the weakest Prime Minister.         
	Any serious political observer knows my remarks on Advani are true. I owe it to myself and the people of India to show where the shoe pinches. Enough is enough, the Prime Minister said.        
	In his response over the past few weeks to Advanis repeated attacks, Manmohan questioned the BJP leaders contribution to the nation and his claim to being strong.        
	Sonia Gandhi, campaigning at Bidar in Karnataka, backed him up and accused Advani of being a slave of the RSS. The Congress president recalled how Advani had described Pakistans founder M.A. Jinnah as secular and then backed off under pressure from the Sangh parivar. What did the strong leader do? He retracted, she mocked.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                            Kasab                                  
	Mumbai, Aug. 28: A key witness who testified against 26/11 co-accused Faheem Ansari and Sabahuddin Shaikh yesterday failed to appear in the special court today, prompting the prosecution to claim that he had gone missing.         
	Nuruddin Shaikh, 35, was later traced to a friends house and will appear in court on Monday.        
	Shaikh, from the western Mumbai suburb of Goregaon, had deposed before judge M.L. Tahaliyani yesterday as a prosecution witness.         
	He had said he saw Ansari giving hand-drawn maps of the four 26/11 terror targets to Sabahuddin at the instance of Lashkar-e-Toiba operations commander Zaki-ur-Rehman Lakhvi.        
	Examined by special public prosecutor Ujjwal Nikam, Shaikh said he had met Ansari, a childhood friend, at a market in Kathmandu in January 2008 and visited a guesthouse at his insistence.         
	Shaikh said Sabahuddin also landed up at the guesthouse and asked Ansari if he had completed Lakhvis work. Seeing some maps in their hands, Shaikh told the court, he had asked the duo if they had a started a business of making maps.         
	Sabahuddin, according to Shaikh, replied they were helping some Pakistani friends plan a visit to Mumbai.

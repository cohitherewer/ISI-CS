          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                            Gagandeep                                  
	Lucknow, Oct. 10: A member of Indias under-19 Test and ODI teams was shot dead outside a crowded Meerut kebab shop last night when a customer protesting delay in service fired indiscriminately from a revolver.        
	Gagandeep Singh, 18, had played a Test and a One-Day International during the junior India teams tour of Australia last April, scoring 41 runs at an average of 41 and taking two wickets at 60.50.        
	He had the talent to represent Indias senior team in the future. A promise has been snuffed out, Meerut Cricket Association president Yudhveer Singh said.        
	The left-handed batsman and left-arm orthodox spinner from Kanpur was in Meerut, 350km west of Lucknow, to play the under-22 C.K. Nayudu Trophy, which starts on Monday. He was standing outside the restaurant around 11.30pm with friends, waiting for their takeaway kebabs, when he unwittingly got caught in the row.        
	He was not very fond of kebabs but might have gone there to accompany his friends, his father Gajendra Singh said.        
	Meerut superintendent of police (city) Prabal Pratap Singh said Gagandeep, shot thrice with a .32 revolver, died on the spot along with restaurant owner Shahnawaz Khan.        
	He was hit accidentally. He did not appear to be the target but got caught in the shooting by antisocial elements, additional director-general of police A.K. Jain said in Lucknow.        
	Alleged shooter Rahul Chaudhary, son of a woman head constable in the crime branch of the state CID, has been arrested.         
	Chaudhary, suspected to be a member of a gang of kidnappers, had picked a fight with Shahnawaz over alleged delay in being served, eyewitnesses said. Asked to wait a while longer, he allegedly abused Shahnawaz and left.        
	He returned with two men in a Santro after half an hour. By then, Gagandeep had arrived. Chaudhary began firing indiscriminately at employees of the shop, an officer said from Meerut. Residents of the Lalkuthi locality took Gagandeep and Shahnawaz to hospital where they were declared dead on arrival. A restaurant employee, Mohammad Sharif, too was hit and is fighting for his life.        
	Gajendra said Gagandeep had called him around 8 last night and promised to perform well in the C.K. Nayudu Trophy. All that remains in the house now is the pile of trophies and certificates he had won, said cousin Suresh Singh. All cricket matches in Kanpur were cancelled today.        
	The police have seized the murder weapon and will slap the National Security Act against Chaudhary to prevent him getting bail, officers said.

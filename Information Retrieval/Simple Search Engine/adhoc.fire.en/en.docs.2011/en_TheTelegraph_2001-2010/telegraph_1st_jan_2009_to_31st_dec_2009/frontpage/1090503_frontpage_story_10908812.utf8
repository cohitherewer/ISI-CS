          SANTOSH K. KIRO                              
	Ranchi, May 2: The Jharkhand Education Tribunal (JET) today directed schools across the state to close for summer vacations from May 4 because of the ongoing heatwave.        
	In his order, that has also been sent to district deputy commissioners and district education officers to ensure implementation, JET chairperson L.P.N. Shahdeo said the tribunal had to step in as schools were not taking any decision in this regard.         
	The order will be applicable to all private, aided and minority schools of Jharkhand, he said, clarifying that the decision was taken because of the heatwave.         
	The JETs intervention comes after Ajay Rai, a parent, had filed a petition asking for such a directive to schools in view of the treacherous summer conditions.        
	He had said children were suffering because of the soaring temperatures, but schools were refusing reschedule of their summer vacations despite several requests.         
	Heat strokes had become a common phenomenon and several cases were being reported in and around the state capital. The Rajendra Institute of Medical Science (RIMS) had admitted over two dozen patients suffering from symptoms of heat stroke. Sixteen others were being treated at the Nagar Mal Modi Seva Sadan Hospital. Another 12 were under treatment at Raj Hospital in Ranchi while Sadar Hospital had admitted six patients in the past two weeks.         
	Most patients suffering from heat stroke are being treated at the OPD, said Dr A.N. Mishra, medical superintendent of MGM College and Hospital in Jamshedpur.         
	In Ranchi, the RIMS administration had prepared a special room for heat stroke cases. We have also asked all medicine and paediatric departments to stay on alert, said RIMS medical superintendent Dr I.B. Prasad.         
	Though the maximum temperature of Ranchi reached an all-time high at 43C, the Met office here predicted some respite from Sunday onwards.        
	One can expect partly cloudy skies with possibility of thunderstorms in the next 24 hours, said G.K. Mohanty, the director of Ranchi Met office.

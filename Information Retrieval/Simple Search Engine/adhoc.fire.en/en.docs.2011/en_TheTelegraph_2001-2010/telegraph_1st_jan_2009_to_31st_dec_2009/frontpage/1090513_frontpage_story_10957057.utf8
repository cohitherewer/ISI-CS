	London, May 12 (PTI): The worlds oldest woman has died at the age of 130 after slipping in the bathroom of her new flat gifted by authorities in Karaganda, Kazakhstan.        
	 Sakhan Dosova never recovered from her fall which broke her hip. She slipped on the bathroom floor of her new flat that local authorities gifted to her after they found she was living in woeful conditions.        
	 The recent census in the Karaganda brought her into the limelight after it was discovered that her date of birth was March 27, 1879, the British tabloid Daily Mail reported. In an interview in March, she said: I dont have any special secret. Ive never taken pills and if I was ill, I used grannies remedies to cure me. I have never eaten sweets.

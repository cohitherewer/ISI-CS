          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Guwahati, Aug. 8: Suspected militants of the Ranjan Daimary faction of the NDFB today abducted a section engineer of Northeast Frontier Railway while he was supervising the construction of a bridge at Batasipara under Dhekiajuli police station in Assams Sonitpur district.        
	Two suspected NDFB cadres whisked away Sanjay Kumar Lama when he was working at the site around noon, the superintendent of police, Sonitpur, Surinder Kumar, said over phone.        
	NF Railway, however, has not lodged an FIR. We have started operations based on our information, a police officer at Dhekiajuli said.        
	Railway officials could not be contacted.         
	The chief public relations officer and the PRO did not respond to calls made on their mobile phones.        
	Police quoted eyewitnesses as saying that two youths on a bike whisked away Lama.        
	On getting the news of the abduction from the other employees of the company, the police launched a massive search operation to rescue the abducted engineer.        
	Last evening, the NDFB had abducted Subhas Das, an employee of a grocery shop located in the remote Rakshakmari area in Dhekiajuli bordering Arunachal Pradesh.         
	According to the police, Lama and Das have both been abducted for ransom.        
	At Dotama Bazar in Kokrajhar district, the CRPF today arrested two armed NDFB militants. A US-made .9 mm pistol and two rounds of cartridges were seized, adds PTI.        
	Earlier this year, the NDFB expelled Daimary, its founder president, days after replacing him with B. Sungthgra, also known as Dhiren Boro, as its new chief.

	New Delhi, March 14: CPM leaders will tomorrow get a taste of Mayavati both as host and comrade  at an address that could have been their home.        
	The BSP office at 14 Rakabganj Road, where the newborn Third Front is set to mark another strategic step at a dinner thrown by the Uttar Pradesh chief minister, had once been allotted to the CPM as residence for its MPs. But Mayavati wanted it for her party.        
	The BSP, which already had the next-door No. 12 as its office, offered the CPM another building on Talkatora Road, less than a kilometre away. Its plan was to shift to No. 14 and turn the original office into a memorial for founder Kanshi Ram.        
	The CPM agreed to the swap, a party source recalled.        
	On the other side of the lane, 15 Rakabganj Road is the Congresss war room.        
	Before the dinner date with Mayavati, the four Left parties will meet at 4 in the afternoon at the CPM office in AK Gopalan Bhavan, a five minutes drive from the BSP hub.        
	At 5.30, the Left parties will meet leaders of the ADMK, Telugu Desam, Telengana Rashtra Samiti, BJD and Janata Dal (Secular). The leaders will later go over for the dinner with Mayavati.        
	Neither BJD chief Naveen Patnaik nor ADMK leader Jayalalithaa is expected to attend either the meeting or the dinner, though their representatives will be present.        
	JD(S) chief H.D. Deve Gowda, the architect of Thursdays rally in Karnataka where the Front was formally born, and Desam boss Chandrababu Naidu will be there at both events.         
	CPI chief A.B. Bardhan said he held preliminary discussions with Patnaik last night. Talks will start within two-three days and the seats to be shared are expected to be finalised by March 20, Bardhan said today.        
	Last night, Naveen ruled out joining or supporting a BJP-led or a Congress-led formation, Bardhan said, asked about the possibility of the BJD joining the Third Front. If he does not want to go either with the BJP or the Congress, its obvious that he will go with non-BJP and non-Congress parties. Let him have his own time.        
	CPM general secretary Prakash Karat said tomorrows meetings were aimed at working on having further co-operation among the Front, his brainchild many had written off as stillborn.

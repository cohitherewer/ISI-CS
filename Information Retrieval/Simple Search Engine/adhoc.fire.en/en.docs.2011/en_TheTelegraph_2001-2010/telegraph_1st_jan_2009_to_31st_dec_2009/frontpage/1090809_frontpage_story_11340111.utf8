	Vancouver, Canada, Aug 9 (UNI): Indian ace Sania Mirza rallied back from a set down to beat local lass Sharon Fichman 6-7(6), 6-3, 6-2 and reach the final of the Odium Brown Vancouver Open tennis championships here.

	In a rain-interrupted match which was streched to past 10 last night, the Indian had to hold her nerves in the gruelling three-setter before she sealed the game in her favour.              
	Sania played the three-set game for the second consecutive night and will be back into action in the final today.              
	After sqandering a 4-1 in the first set, the 23-year-old Indian was made to struggle by her Canadian rival in a marathon 12th game on her serve to force a tie-break and missed two set points in the tie-beak before she lost it.              
	However, Sania came back hard to take way the next two sets easily, despite dropping her serve twice and breaking Fichman thrice in the second set.              
	Threafter the Indian didnt looked back after she took the decisive break in the fifth game of the decider.              
	Finally, Fichman lost her next service to concede Sania walk away with the third set and match too.

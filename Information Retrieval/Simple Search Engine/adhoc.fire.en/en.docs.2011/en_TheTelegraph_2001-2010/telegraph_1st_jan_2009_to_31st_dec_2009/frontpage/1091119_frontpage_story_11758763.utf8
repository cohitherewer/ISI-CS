          OUR CORRESPONDENT                               
	Silchar/Guwahati, Nov. 18: Several cadres of the Dima Halam Daogah (Dilip) group have fled their designated camps with weapons over the past three days, jolting the police and administration out of their slumber.         
	Confirming the desertions, DHD (Dilip) chairman Dilip Nunisa today blamed it on the cadres frustration over the slow progress of talks with the government.         
	The 800-odd cadres of the group surrendered in 2003, after which they were accommodated in five designated camps  one in Karbi Anglong and the rest in North Cachar Hills.         
	Nunisa said over phone from Haflong that the first desertion by 11 unarmed cadres was from a camp in Umrangsu, an industrial town 140km from Haflong, on Sunday.         
	Last night, yet another band of four cadres fled from the Deogbra camp, 120km from the district headquarters town, taking at least four AK-47 assault rifles with them.         
	All the deserters are from lower ranks, Nunisa said.        
	Police in Haflong suspect that the deserters could join the outfits James Dimasa group which did not come overground during the mass surrender of the DHD (Jewel) on October 2. The James group is said to comprise 20-25 cadres.         
	The names of the fugitives are yet to be collected by both the police and Nunisas associates.         
	Both desertions point to the lax security system at the camps, where the arms are to be kept inside a storeroom, one key of which is to be in the possession of police and another with militants.         
	Both the police and DHD (Dilip) are probing how these arms were carried away from the camp by the deserters.         
	The system of double-locking of arms was introduced only two months ago before the capitulation of the dissident group of the DHD, led by Niranjan Hojai, on October 2 before chief minister Tarun Gogoi.         
	Before that, the rebels were allowed to carry arms when they were on duty or on occasional visits to their homes.         
	Nunisa said the rank and file was frustrated over the Centres procrastination inarriving at an amicable settlement on their demand for a separate Dimaraji state and other sundry economic and social demand packages.         
	He said both the police and his associates have now launched a manhunt for the deserters.

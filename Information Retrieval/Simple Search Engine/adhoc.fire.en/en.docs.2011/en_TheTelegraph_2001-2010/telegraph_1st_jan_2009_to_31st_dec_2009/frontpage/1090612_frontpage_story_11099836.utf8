The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Adda, pakora amp; Tatkal decisions
                                                                                                           Adda, pakora amp; Tatkal decisions
          JAYANTA ROY CHOWDHURY AND R. SURYAMURTHY                            Mamata                                  
	New Delhi, June 11: Mamata Banerjee today turned an informal chat with reporters over the teacup into a storm of impromptu decision-making, durbar-style, on issues ranging from Rajdhani meals to toilets.        
	A complaint from a reporter on Tatkal waiting lists saw instant justice handed out.        
	There should be no waiting lists on Tatkal tickets... we did not have that when we ran the railways earlier, the railway minister frowned at her officials at the Rail Bhavan session.        
	And Tatkal passengers to Kanpur on a Delhi-Calcutta train should pay only till Kanpur and not till Calcutta, she said, when told this was now the practice.        
	The adda over tea, paneer pakoras, chips and malai cham-chams had started like any other news briefing but Mamata, asked about touchy issues like her partys apparent opposition to the governments divestment policy, quickly changed its tenor.        
	Instead of asking me questions, give me your suggestions to improve the railways, she said.        
	As a flood of complaints poured in, she summoned Railway Board member (traffic) Shri Prakash and executive director Jayanta Saha to join her special officer Ratan Mukherjee in taking notes.        
	Why do trains like the Rajdhani refuse to serve extra meals even if they are running late, someone asked. Mamata told Prakash to ensure this did not happen in future.        
	The last railway administration has added an uncomfortable third bunk on the sides of some trains to earn extra money, went a complaint. Mamatas response: she has already ordered the measure scrapped.        
	A journalist said the computerised information service at phone number 139 had been outsourced and the agency running it was trying to increase customers calling time by adding unnecessary instructions and ad jingles.         
	Mamata told her officials to look into it and muttered: Vital things should be done by us.        
	But she could not entirely escape the tricky questions. Someone tried to get her to say the Manmohan Singh governments public-private partnership (PPP) model was flawed.        
	She narrowed her eyes and looked at the reporter before slowly replying with a smile: I started PPP in the railways in my last tenure, and we welcome that mode in new projects but not in existing railway facilities.        
	She ticked off reporters who said there was an impression she was turning into a minister for Bengal.        
	I have not been able to give enough time to Bengal. In this age of globalised communication, we can run a government from anywhere but I have spent more time here, she said. I will work for all... not just for Bengal.        
	Then came a slippery one on her predecessor. Lalu Prasad had signed an order in his last days in office allowing all former railway ministers two extra gold passes (complimentary passes for top officials) over and above the two they were already entitled to.        
	Asked for her reaction, Mamata looked somewhat embarrassed but said: I have great respect for Laluji (but) no new changes (in the rules on complimentary passes) should be made (in these difficult times).        
	She would have been thankful for the easiest one. Yes, she would upgrade toilets and build new ones  and not necessarily pay toilets.

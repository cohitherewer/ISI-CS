          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Oct. 5: Drink in public in the capital and you will be fined Rs 50,000 and jailed for six months before you can say hic, if the Delhi government has its way.        
	Thats a 250-fold hike from the current fine of Rs 200, but the state government needed to show it wasnt going soft on the snifter after deciding six days ago that it would allow liquor outlets at malls.        
	That revenue-raker raised fears that customers would start drinking in front of malls  perhaps using plastic coffee cups as camouflage  spoiling the atmosphere at these venues for family outings. So the government decided to balance the move.        
	It will, therefore, table an excise bill in the winter session of the Assembly that will give the official thumbs-up to liquor vends at malls but also turn public drinking into a non-bailable offence.        
	We have allowed sale of liquor at shopping malls, but it does not mean we will take a lenient approach towards those who consume alcohol at public places, state finance minister A.K. Walia said.        
	So, buy your liquor from a mall by all means, but wait till you get home before uncorking it.        
	Homemaker Sanchita Guha, 35, isnt convinced. We see people drinking at every street corner, how many are actually fined? The one place we could go to safely with our families will now become a den for antisocial people. Im sure they will start drinking in front of malls, she said.        
	A young Delhiite bore her out: Ive done it many times. I cant drink at home, so I drink near this beer shop with my friends in a car late at night. We get plastic cups and starters from the shop next door. The local cop knows us; sometimes he shares a drink or two with us.        
	In Calcutta, those caught drinking at a public place are charged with disorderly conduct and usually fined Rs 80.        
	The Delhi government has no figures on how many people it has fined for drinking in public. However, in reply to a right-to-information application by the Voluntary Health Association of India, it has said it fined 46,531 people and institutions between October 2, 2008, and early September this year for smoking in public places.

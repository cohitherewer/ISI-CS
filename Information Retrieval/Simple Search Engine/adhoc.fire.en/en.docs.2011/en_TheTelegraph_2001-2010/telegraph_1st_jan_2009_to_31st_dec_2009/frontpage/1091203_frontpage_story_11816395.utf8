The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | At Booth No. 1, a turnaround
                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                At Booth No. 1, a turnaround
          RAJ KUMAR                                              
	Mandar, Dec. 2: No one turned up to vote at Booth No. 1 of Mandar constituency in the Assembly elections of 1995. Today, men and women, including the elderly and children of Honhe Pakar Toli village, defied a Maoist poll boycott to do just the opposite.        
	With voter ID cards in their hands, even octogenarian women queued up in front of the booth from early morning to cast their votes. By 10.20am, as many as 167 of the 576 registered voters had voted. And another 50 were in line.         
	There was another group of 50 people hovering around makeshift party camps to collect their serial numbers in the voters list, a trend that was far more encouraging than what was seen here during the Lok Sabha polls when only 20 per cent votes were cast.         
	What prompted this turnaround? The overwhelming presence of security forces did help, but the real reason was perhaps best explained by Ashok Yadav, a local resident and himself a victim of Maoist terror.         
	This area was under the influence of the MCC till 2000. Gradually, their influence began to peter away and we began feeling a bit safer, said the villager, who lost his son, Rajesh, to rebel bullets only six months back.        
	But Ashok Yadav refused to talk about his sons death. Today was voting day and like him fellow villagers had all come out to vote.        
	Maoists abducted and killed Rajesh when he did not do as instructed, said another villager standing nearby, adding that even now, rebels often sent emissaries to try and take control of the village with a population of around 2000, primarily Mundas and Oraons.         
	There are three localities in the village, Lurungi, Honhe and Pakar Toli, and residents main expectation from this election is an elected representative who would ensure they got power, good roads, a culvert on the Honhe river and pond to irrigate their fields.        
	Surprisingly, the mood of the people wasnt combative. Rather, with children playing around the booth, it was festive. Some of them gathered around the district armed police jawan, curiously eyeing his firearm, while others were busy collecting pamphlets that were being distributed by supporters of the main contenders, Jharkhand Janadhikar Manchs Bandhu Tirkey, Congresss Deo Kumar Dhan and Jharkhand Partys Prabhakar Tirkey.        
	And when an irritated jawan tried to shoo the children away, one of them, Rikesh Mahto, shot back. Benches from my classroom have been brought out, and I am here to try and spot the one on which I sit in school. I have marked mine with chalk, said the class II student of the local school thats serving as Booth No. 1.         
	By afternoon, the securitymen posted there began to talk, obviously relieved that voting had passed off peacefully. Naga battalion and Seema Suraksha Bal jawans have not been deployed here. The entire booth is under our guard as we are well acquainted with the area, said the district armed police jawan who had come from Latehar.

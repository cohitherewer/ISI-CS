	New Delhi, June 10: Changes in planetary orbits may nudge Mars into a collision course with Earth about three billion years from now, the largest simulation of the future of the solar system has indicated.        
	Astronomers Jacques Laskar and Mickael Gastinaeu from the Paris Observatory calculated the positions of the planets in the distant future.         
	Their results show a 99 per cent chance of a stable, familiar solar system in the next five billion years and only a 1 per cent probability of a collision in the inner solar system.         
	The researchers simulated 2,501 possible orbital scenarios and found that in 20  1 per cent  a deformation of Mercurys orbit leads to a collision with Venus or the Sun. The findings appear in the journal Nature tomorrow.        
	In one simulation, about 3.3 billion years from now, the orbit of Mars will bring it 794km from Earth. At this close distance, Earths gravity will break apart Mars and lead to multiple impacts with Earth.         
	Collisions are possible, but they are difficult, Laskar said.         
	The astronomers also tweaked the positions of Mars to simulate 201 versions of the Mars-Earth close encounter. The resulting scenarios led to different outcomes  Mars and Earth have a direct collision in 29 scenarios, Venus collides with Earth in 18, Mercury falls into the Sun in 33 and Mars hurtles into the Sun in 48 scenarios. In five scenarios, Mars is ejected from the solar system.        
	We know the solar system is stable in the short term, but there has been a question about long-term stability, said Dipankar Bhattacharya, a scientist at the Inter University Centre for Astronomy and Astrophysics, Pune.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | So-cool Sallu melts girl, dad amp; rivals
                                                                                                           So-cool Sallu melts girl, dad amp; rivals
  - Star regales crowd with one-liners and seeks votes (after a whisper)           SAMYABRATA RAY GOSWAMI IN KALWA, MAHARASHTRA                            Salman at a rally in Mumbai                                        
	A shirtless youth displays his bare body from a balcony to cheering crowds in the small chowk.        
	Salman Khan is due any minute.        
	The most politically incorrect of Bollywood stars is slated to canvass at a political rally for Nationalist Congress Party candidate Vasant Davkhare.        
	Even on a Monday afternoon, over 1,000 people have gathered in this tiny square at Kalwa Naka in the heart of the industrial town of Kalwa near Maharashtras Thane city.        
	Davkhare, 60, an MLA contesting the Kalyan Lok Sabha constituency, is a first-time Parliament aspirant and faces a formidable challenge from his Shiv Sena opponent.        
	But this Monday, with Salman by his side, Davkhare has decided to hold his election rally bang in front of the Shiv Sena shakha at Kalwa Naka. As the crowds begin to swell, the dozen Sena men manning the shakha decide to down their shutters and join them.        
	Soon chairs and tables are pulled out of the shakha office and placed on the chowk so people can sit or stand on them as they wait for Salman.        
	This is our goodwill gesture. Many of the people here today are Shiv Sena sympathisers or fence-sitters. Salman Khan may be here for the NCP, but we will make the best use of this assembly before our shakha gate, said Anil Dave, Sena activist.        
	Arpita Pingle and her cousins jump on one table. A Class X student is not old enough to vote, though.        
	I am here for Salman. All my cousins and friends are here for him  whether they are voting or not. I know he is 40-plus, but it doesnt matter. He is so cool, she says earnestly.                    
	Arpita chattily thanks the Sena men and accepts the election pamphlets they nonchalantly distribute as the NCP activists turn a blind eye.        
	We are already provoking them by holding our rally right at their doorstep. We do not want an ugly situation here with Salman due any time now, says Aparna Salvi, a local NCP councillor.        
	A huge burst of firecrackers has everybody on their feet.        
	Salman arrives in his Landcruiser, followed by Davkhare and his men. In an uncharacteristic display of punctuality for a Bollywood actor, he is just 15 minutes late.        
	Davkhare walks the 20 yards from the main road to the chowk; Salman drives straight up to the stage.        
	The crowd goes berserk --- even the NCP workers make a dash for the Bollywood star, completely ignoring their aspiring party candidate.        
	In minutes he is on the stage waving. The crowd goes hysterical.        
	Arpitas father, who had been admonishing his teenaged daughter minutes ago for her exuberance, now stands on the chair clapping deliriously.        
	Meanwhile, short speeches by Davkhare and his party colleagues are on but no ones listening.        
	The crowd breaks into a roar as Salman spots and then salutes the shirtless youth who has been displaying his six packs for the past one hour now.        
	The actor is then handed the mike.        
	I am here because my daddy asked me to come and campaign for Davkhare saab. They are old friends, he says.        
	One should listen to their parents. I hope you do too, he looks at the college students and Arpitas gang and winks. They nearly swoon.        
	Oh I do, comments Tamal Wagle, a first-time voter in the crowd. I am here to see you but I shall vote for the candidate my family supports.        
	A middle-aged woman shoves and jostles to stand next to Salman, almost pushing Davkhare out of the stage.        
	Madam, ab aap mere aur Davkhare saab ke beech mein aa hi gayeen (Madam, you have now come between me and Davkhare), Salman jokes.        
	People ask me why I campaign for different political parties. I want to tell you that I campaign only for people who I feel will be able to bring change, people who want to bring development. I have cousins who stay nearby in Mumbra. I know this Kalyan area. I know the problems. I know Davkhare saab will address them  if he doesnt, just let me know, he says in a mock threat.        
	Then, turning to Davkhare, he delivers a couple of gems.        
	Davkhare saab here is wearing all white like a true neta. But let me assure you he is white from inside as well. Not a kala-dhanda wala (not engaged in anything illegal). And he has pots of money, he grins.        
	At this point Davkhare looks anxiously towards Salman, but the actor is on a roll.        
	And because he has pots of money, he does not need to steal from the public coffers. I am sure he is therefore a very good candidate to serve the constituency honestly, he says.        
	And then suddenly he turns dead serious and launches into an impassioned speech that leaves everyone speechless.        
	Devkhare is a karmayogi -- not a dharmayogi like some candidates. Beware of these dharmayogis -- they can be both Hindu and Muslim. They tell you to vote in the name of religion. They promise God will set everything right. I am asking you all  has God solved all your problems? You have to solve your problems yourselves. So go out there and vote. Exercise your right. Choose a candidate who does not use religion to divide you. Choose a candidate who will work to bring progress, he says and stops to pause for a moment.        
	The crowd is totally silent.        
	I am the son of a Hindu Brahmin mother and a Muslim Pathan father. I am telling you, this religious divide and politics over it is all nonsense, just a way to keep you and me from pondering about more serious issues like jobs, education and health. Do not let such people win, he says and pauses.        
	Davkhare whispers in his ears.        
	Oh yes, vote for Davkhare saab, vote for the clock symbol, he says, suddenly looking bored and distracted.        
	He then sits on his haunches at the edge of the stage and starts shaking hands and signing autographs. Minutes later he climbs into his car and drives away.        
	I dont know whether he used us or we used him, says Davkhares son Niranjan as he leaves.

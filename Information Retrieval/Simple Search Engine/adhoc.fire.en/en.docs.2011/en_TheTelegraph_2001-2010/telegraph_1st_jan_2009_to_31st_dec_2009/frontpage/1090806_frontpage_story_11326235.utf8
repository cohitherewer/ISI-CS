The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Stress over army vice-chief choice

  - Kapoor looks past Calcutta officer         OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              Deepak Kapoor, (below) VK Singh				                                       
	New Delhi, Aug. 5: The defence establishment is labouring over senior appointments in the army after the chief, General Deepak Kapoor, is understood to have preferred the northern army commander, Lt General Prabodh Chandra Bhardwaj, as the next vice-chief.         
	In the fitness of things, a senior officer said, the post should go to the army commander in Fort William, Calcutta, Lt General V.K. Singh. He is the senior-most officer in his rank with adequate years of service.         
	It is not necessary that an army chief should have served as vice-chief. All seven army commanders (eastern, western, southern, south-western, northern, central and training) and the vice-chief are of equivalent rank. The difference is that the vice-chief officiates as the chief when the top general is not available or is touring.         
	Singh, the eastern army commander, is also tipped to be the next army chief in March 2010 when General Kapoor is due to retire.         
	Even if Singh is not appointed the vice-chief, he will be the top contender for the chiefs post.         
	Within the top echelons of the army there are two contradictory views over the choice for the next vice-chief. According to one, Lt General Bhardwaj has served as 14 corps commander headquartered in Leh and subsequently as the northern army commander based in Udhampur.         
	The northern command is the most operationally active. He should, therefore, be brought to Delhi and given other responsibilities.         
	The second view holds that since Singh is most likely to be the next army chief, he should have stepped into the vice-chiefs office so that he can take over as the chief easily. General Kapoor was himself vice-chief before taking on the top job, it is argued.         
	The next vice-chief is scheduled to take over from the current vice-chief, Lt General Noble Thamburaj, after he retires in October.         
	General Kapoors recommendation that the northern army commander, Lt General Bharadwaj, should take over has not yet been accepted. Defence minister A.K. Antony is understood to have inquired about the reasons for the recommendation.        
	The defence ministry, after considering the list of senior officers, may also suggest the appointment of a third officer as the vice-chief. The name of the southern army commander, Lt General Pradeep Khanna, is doing the rounds.         
	The posting has to be cleared by the Cabinet Committee on Appointments (CCA) after the defence minister proposes it.         
	The top echelons of the navy will also see nearly 10 senior posts, including the chiefs, being vacated and filled in at the end of August. These are routine changes. The chief of naval staff, Admiral Sureesh Mehta, is due to retire next month.         
	Vice-Admiral Nirmal Kumar Verma, currently the eastern naval commander in Visakhapatnam, was named the next chief by the government as early as June.         
	The baton of the chairman, chiefs of staff committee, will pass from Admiral Mehta to General Kapoor. The post is held by the senior-most serving chief.

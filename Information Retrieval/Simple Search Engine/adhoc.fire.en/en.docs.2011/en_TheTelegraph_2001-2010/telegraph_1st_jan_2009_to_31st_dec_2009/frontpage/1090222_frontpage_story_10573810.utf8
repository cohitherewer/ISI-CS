The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Obama clears mercury deal path
                                                                                                           Obama clears mercury deal path
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Feb. 21: After eight deadlocked years, 140-odd countries including India, China and the US have agreed to have a legally binding treaty to control mercury pollution, a threat to people everywhere.         
	A dramatic shift in US policy, brought about by the Barack Obama administration, made the accord possible at yesterdays United Nations Environment Programme meeting in Nairobi, environment groups said.        
	The US move probably prompted a change of heart also by India and China who, like the Bush government, had opposed legally binding steps.        
	Mercury, a toxic metal, is spewed into the environment by coal-burning power plants, industrial products including mercury-based thermometers, mining and artisanship.        
	When mercury from air or water ends up in humans, it may harm unborn foetuses, stunt childrens development, and cause heart and nerve diseases in adults.        
	A study of fish from five Calcutta markets  Gariahat, Sahababur Bazaar, Manicktala, Sealdah and Behala  by NGO Toxics Link showed that 24 of 60 fish samples had higher levels of a mercury compound than allowed by food adulteration laws.        
	Surveys have suggested that Shiv lingas (phallic symbols in Hindu temples) may contain mercury. This could be a source of mercury poisoning in India  people drink water or milk in contact with the Shiv lingas, Toxics Link director Ravi Agarwal said.        
	The treaty, expected to be worked out by 2013, will bind nations to act to reduce the use of mercury products, slash atmospheric emissions of the metal, and cut mercury mining. As one of its consequences, the standard household thermometers may stop using mercury.        
	Analysts said Indias earlier opposition to a legally binding treaty may have been prompted by fears that such a treaty may be used to impose curbs on thermal power plants.        
	The UNEP estimates that of the 6,000 tonnes of mercury that enters the environment each year, some 2,000 tonnes come from thermal power plants. Mercury can travel hundreds of kilometres through air and water.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Dispur packages for twin hill districts
                                                                                                           Dispur packages for twin hill districts
          A STAFF REPORTER                                    
	Guwahati, Sept. 24: Dispur is preparing economic packages for two underdeveloped and militancy-hit districts of North Cachar Hills and Karbi Anglong.         
	Disclosing this today, chief minister Tarun Gogoi, who returned from the US yesterday, said development in the two districts would be put on the fast track. Gogoi also said two police battalions would be raised to accommodate all surrendering militants in the state.         
	Describing the return of the DHD (J) militants to the mainstream as a very good development, he said the militancy-infested NC Hills district could now see a lot of development. He said because of militancy, development activities suffered a lot there in the past few years.         
	A lot of development money was wasted and misutilised, Gogoi said in a veiled reference to the diversion of council funds to militants coffers.         
	Referring to the surrender of over 300 cadres of the DHD (J), Gogoi said initially there were lots of apprehensions whether the group would actually lay down arms. But somehow we could convince them to come overground, Gogoi recalled. The chief minister confirmed that the commander-in-chief of the DHD (J), Niranjan Hojai, too, would surrender.         
	Without elaborating on the economic packages his government was preparing for the twin hill districts, Gogoi said both NC Hills and Karbi Anglong would now get special attention.         
	Gogoi is expected to attend the formal surrender ceremony at Haflong on October 2, coinciding with the birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi.         
	The Karbi Longri North Cachar Hills Liberation Front, which is based in Karbi Anglong, has also offered a unilateral ceasefire and given the government time till this month to start a political dialogue.         
	Sources said the twin hill districts were crying out for development, the lack of which has been perceived to be a key reason for the birth of militancy.        
	Talking to reporters today, Gogoi shared the experiences of his US visit and dwelt on issues that had cropped up in the state in his absence.         
	He said the government would take action against any official found guilty of committing excesses while quelling the teachers agitation in Dispur on Id. He the government would constitute a judicial inquiry if necessary to unravel the truth.         
	The government will not try to protect anyone. The guilty will be punished, he said.         
	Gogoi, however, criticised the teachers for linking their agitation with a religious festival. What was the motive in holding the agitation during Id? They (teachers) have done it with the consent of the AGP. I am leaving this to the people to judge whether the teachers were justified in giving religious colour to their agitation.        
	On the demands of the teachers, Gogoi said the government was not in a position to provincialise over 16,000 schools.         
	We will give financial assistance to the schools which are doing well, Gogoi said, pointing out that 7,000 non-provincialised schools already got financial assistance from the government.

                        Indian composer A.R. Rahman holds up his Oscars for best original song and best original score for "Slumdog Millionaire" backstage at the 81st Academy Awards in Hollywood, California, February 22, 2009.   (Reuters)      
	 Los Angeles, Feb 23 (PTI): A R Rahman today became the first Indian to win two Oscars for his scintillating music in rdquo;Slumdog Millionaire rdquo; which swept the Academy awards winning eight with one going to sound engineer Resul Pookutty. ldquo;Slumdog Millionaire rdquo;, a rags to riches story of a Mumbai slum dweller, who goes on to win USD 20 million in a quiz show, was adjudged the best film. 	It also fetched Danny Boyle the Best Director award, Simon Beaufoy best Adapted Screenplay and Anthony Dod Mantle the best Cinematography award. The film was also awarded for Best Editing. 	A beaming 43 year old Rahman said: ldquo;Before coming here I was excited and terrified. The last time I felt that way was when I was getting married. 	 rdquo;There is a Hindi dialogue 'mere pass Ma hai' which means even if I have got nothing I have my mother here. I want to thank her for coming all the way to support me, rdquo; Chennai born Rahman said in his acceptance speech after bagging the Original Score Oscar. 	The foottapping number 'Jai ho', with lyrics by Gulzar, was adjudged the Best Song. 	Pookutty, who hails from Kerala's Kollam district, received the award for Best Sound Mixing with corecordists Ian Tapp and Richard Pryke.   
	Smile Pinki, a 39-minute short film in Hindi and Bhojpuri, directed by Emmy-nominated producer Megan Mylan also won the best documentary short subject Oscar.

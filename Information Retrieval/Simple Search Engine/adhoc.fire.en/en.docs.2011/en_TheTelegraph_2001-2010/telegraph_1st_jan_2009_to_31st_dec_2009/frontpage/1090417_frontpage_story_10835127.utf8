The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Women, saluted but needle in election haystack
                                                                                                           Women, saluted but needle in election haystack
  - Lads rule the roost in Aishwaryas land that bailed out Indira and gifted Sonia a cushion										      SUNANDA K. DATTA-RAY IN BANGALORE                                          
	If Bengalis worship Tagore instead of reading him, as Rudraprasad Sengupta says in Nandikars reworked version of Football, Kannadigas exalt womens power instead of exercising it.        
	Although Karnataka claims a 1000:964 male:female ratio, there are just 11 women among several hundred candidates for 28 Lok Sabha seats. With only four of them fighting under recognisable colours, there can be no question of living up to the commitment of 33 per cent female representation.        
	Women are only for decoration, implies the Janata Dal (Secular) which hasnt fielded a single female. Yet, the party whose parent organisation, the undivided Janata Dal, under leaders like Ramakrishna Hegde and, indeed, the architect of the third front, H.D. Deve Gowda, gave Karnataka a distinct political identity, flaunts as its election symbol the picture of a woman carrying a haystack. She must be feeling very neglected now.        
	The disgruntled sex workers who gathered recently under the auspices of two local NGOs, Ashodaya Samithi and Ashraya, had a special focus, but the rumblings heard at their two-day Positive Habba (Festival of HIV positive people) were part of the general complaint of discrimination under a dispensation that looks the other way when Sri Ram Sena hooligans clobber girls who are bold enough to go to pubs and bars and police tip off other chauvinist puritans to burst into a private party at a farmhouse.         
	Krishna Byregowda, the savvy young candidate from Bangalore South with a masters degree from the American University in Washington DC, calls it cultural fascism.        
	But it may not be only a top-down phenomenon. Though women form nearly half the vote bank  perhaps because of it  the share of victorious women has been declining as a percentage of those who contest Assembly elections. Perhaps many female Kannadiga voters are also like the serving maid in She Stoops to Conquer who, when ordered to serve the ladies first, protested, But I like the lads best.        
	Contrast this apathy towards women with Indonesia, which went to the polls last week and where an apolitical Internet blogger gave several reasons for preferring women candidates. They are not as corrupt as their male counterparts. Women politicians are more sensitive about social issues such as education, health, family problems and poverty. They are less likely to be gung-ho and macho when dealing with tensions and conflicts and, finally, women are more picky when it comes to money, which is good when it comes to scrutinising budgets.         
	No wonder President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono has a female finance minister, he wrote. The clincher is that the writers wife makes a better job of handling household finances than he would.         
	Ideology being determinedly sexless, the shadowy CPIs one and only investment in the electoral fray is female  Radha Sundaresh in Udipi-Chikmagalur. By that token and on a pro rata basis, the ruling BJP should have boasted at least a dozen women candidates. But theres only a single shrinking violet, J. Shantamma, an unknown novice who might still defeat N.Y. Hanumanthappa, a retired chief justice, without any effort on her part.         
	Her brother, B. Sreeramulu, is Karnatakas health minister. People are identifying me as Sreeramulus sister, the housewife admits with shy candour. That will ensure my victory. What may do so with even greater certainty, given the power of money and influence, is the fact that her sponsors are the rich and powerful Reddy brothers, mining lords of Bellary, where she is contesting.        
	True to its culture, the Congress party not only has two women candidates but both can claim some distinction. Tejaswini Gowda is a veritable Amazon, having vanquished her namesake, the former Prime Minister, with her very first throw of the electoral dice in 2004. This time she is pitted against the rising son of Karnatakas secular politics, H.D. Kumaraswamy, also a former chief minister. Like father like son is the Congress quip of the day.        
	Margaret Alva, the other Congresswoman and the only one of the four with a profile outside Karnataka, has been shunted off to Canara for daring to accuse her party bosses of selling nominations. Like Maneka Gandhi, she, too, knows the pain of motherhood: the high command refused her son, Nivedith, a ticket.        
	By rights, Karnataka women could have expected much much more. This, after all, is the state that provided Sonia Gandhi with a base in 1999, though she dumped Bellary in favour of Amethi with its dynastic and prime ministerial implications.         
	Even more significantly, Karnataka rescued Indira Gandhi from political exile in 1978. But D.B. Chandre Gowda, then Chikmagalurs sitting MP who gallantly sacrificed his seat for her, recently became the seventh Congress politician of some distinction to abandon the Hand for the Lotus. An exultant BJP gloats on the defection as a sign of the times. Others say it only confirms that the BJP is becoming an old age pensioners home for retired and retrenched Congressmen.        
	Be that as it may, the hand that rocks the cradle doesnt rule the world of Narendra Modis shishya even if some Kannadigas still speak glowingly of Gangubai Hangal and Ashwini Nachappa, Shakuntala Devi and Aishwarya Rai.  
	 Karnataka goes to the polls on April 23 and 30

	Colombo, Feb. 20 (AP): Two Tamil Tiger aircraft launched a surprise raid on the Sri Lankan capital late tonight, an act of defiance by the beleaguered rebels in the face of a punishing military offensive in the north.        
	The military shot down both planes, one of which crashed into a government office building, killing one person and wounding more than 40. A PTI report put the death toll at two.        
	The raid was an embarrassment for the government, which has driven the rebels out of most of their northern strongholds and said it was on the verge of destroying the group.        
	The attack was the first air raid here since the rebels bombed a power station on the outskirts of the city in October.        
	The military said two weeks ago that it had captured the rebels last hidden airstrip in the north, effectively grounding its tiny air force. But tonights raid proved the Tamil Tigers retain the ability to launch paralysing attacks across the country even as their ground forces are under siege in a small patch of territory in the northeast.        
	Two of the planes approached the capital just after 9.30pm, military spokesperson Brigadier Udaya Nanayakkara said.         
	The government immediately shut off all power in the capital and searchlights criss-crossed the sky. Anti-aircraft fire rippled across the city, tracer rounds flew overhead and flares lit up the night.        
	Anti-aircraft fire felled one of the planes, which crashed into a tax office in the centre of the city. The crash killed one person and wounded 43.        
	All the front windows of the high-rise building were shattered and furniture seen inside was charred and splintered. The second plane was shot down near an air force base in the town of Katunayake.        
	The military did not explain how the rebels were able to launch their aircraft.        
	The rebels are believed to have three or four light aircraft, which they have used sporadically for raids.         
	The air strikes had boos-ted morale of the rebels in recent years, though they have caused more fear than damage.

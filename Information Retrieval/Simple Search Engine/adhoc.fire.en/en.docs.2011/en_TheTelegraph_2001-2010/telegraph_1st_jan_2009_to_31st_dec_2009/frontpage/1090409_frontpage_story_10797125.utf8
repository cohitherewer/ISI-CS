The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | US wants soft India in Kabul 
                                                                                                           US wants soft India in Kabul 
          SUJAN DUTTA                            Holbrooke in Delhi. (AFP)                                  
	New Delhi, April 8: The US wants greater Indian soft-power in Afghanistan, meaning an increase in Delhis investment and more intensive engagement in development projects.        
	The message has been conveyed to Delhi by President Barack Obamas special representative for Afghanistan and Pakistan, Richard Holbrooke, and the chairman of the US joint chiefs of staff committee, Admiral Mike Mullen.        
	Holbrooke and Mullen were in Pakistan yesterday and in Afghanistan the day before. The agenda for their five-day tour of the subcontinent did not include attempts to broker peace between Islamabad and New Delhi, Holbrooke said at the very outset here.        
	For the first time since Partition, India, Pakistan and the US have a common threat (terrorism). It is in the interest of all three to work together, said Holbrooke after a meeting with foreign secretary Shiv Shankar Menon and the Indian ambassador to Afghanistan, Jayant Prasad. Holbrooke also met the national security adviser.        
	This is a view that contrasts with Indias. Only yesterday, home minister P. Chidambaram said India was surrounded by a ring of fire, meaning that forces of de-stabilisation in Pakistan, Sri Lanka and Bangladesh were threatening India. Unless these forces were tackled, Indias stability would continue to be threatened. Among these forces, the biggest threat was from fundamentalist elements in Pakistan. The US needed to do more to tackle them in Pakistan.         
	Delhi does not yet see a move in that direction from Washington.         
	Both Holbrooke and Mullen emphasised that Indias assistance to Kabul was central to the efforts to resolve problems in Afghanistan.         
	They acknowledged that India was already involved in building roads and in agriculture, power and educational projects. They also stressed on the need to revive a shelved project to build Kabuls Parliament.        
	(We) cant settle issues in Afghanistan and other issues without Indias full involvement and their own expressions of views. When Mullen and I met (Indian) ambassador Prasad in Kabul... he outlined Indias assistance plan for Afghanistan. The plan is impressive, Holbrooke said.         
	Both Holbrooke and Mullen said there was no discussion on Indian troop levels on the border with Pakistan. This was in the context of reports suggesting that the US had asked India to reduce troops.         
	Admiral Mullen said Indias role in Afghanistan was absolutely critical because there was an appreciation that problems in that country could not be resolved by military power alone.

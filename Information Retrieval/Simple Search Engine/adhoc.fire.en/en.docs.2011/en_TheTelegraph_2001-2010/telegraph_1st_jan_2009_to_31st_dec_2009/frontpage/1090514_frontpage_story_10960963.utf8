          AMIT ROY                            (From left) Italian actress Asia Argento, American director James Gray, Sharmila Tagore, French actress and jury president Isabelle Huppert                                   
	Cannes, May 13: Sharmila Tagore said today she saw no conflict between being a censor and breathing the libertarian air of Cannes.        
	Appearing ever so slightly irritated when she appeared at the traditional jury conference on day one of the 62nd Cannes Film Festival, the chairman of the Central Board of Film Certification in India responded in a forthright manner when an Indian journalist made so bold as to almost question her presence at the worlds most high profile gathering of actors, actresses, directors, producers and scriptwriters.        
	Mindful she was addressing an international gathering, this was not the demure Aparna of Apur Sansar who replied. I dont want to give a long spiel on India, she said haughtily. In India we live in many centuries  there are regional sensitivities.        
	It was drawn to her attention that her biography in the official Cannes brochure had made no mention of her role as chief censor  making her seem as almost a poacher among gamekeepers.        
	Sharmila emphasised, however, that I see no conflict between being the head of Indias censor board and the personality who was invited at the last minute to be the ninth and final member of the main jury at Cannes. She will have to sit through the 20 films in competition for the coveted Palm dOr.        
	When I sit on the board, I am looking at India. I have other identities. I am here to look at films as a jury member.        
	Earlier, she pointed out that this year there are wonderful directors  some better known than others. She  along with other jury members  would bring to bear our feelings and intuition in responding to the movies.        
	We are bringing a little bit of us and will meet (other jury members) half way  something wonderful will happen.        
	For her first public appearance at Cannes, Sharmila picked a pale yellow sari with blue flecks, worn with a pearl necklace and drop earrings.        
	In Isabelle Huppert, the jury appears to have a remarkably eloquent president. The French actress has made films that have brought her to Cannes on no fewer than 17 occasions  a record that has not been bettered.        
	We are not here to judge films, she said. We are here to love films, some we will love more than others.        
	She was philosophical when she added: It is difficult to express why you love something, why you are touched by a picture or a work of art or a painting  it is a deep issue. Perhaps we bring a bit of our souls.        
	Isabelle is only the fourth woman to head the jury in over six decades but without doubt one of the most impressive.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Dynasty to meet dynasty in US
                                                                                                           Dynasty to meet dynasty in US
          K.P. NAYAR                              
	Washington, June 14: Scions of Indias many political dynasties of the new millennium will arrive in one group in the US next weekend for a stint of academic work at Yale designed to promote their careers and then travel to Washington to engage their dynastic counterparts in the US.        
	Among the dozen members of Parliament will be Mausam Noor, new member of the Lok Sabha from Malda North and niece of A.B.A. Ghani Khan Chowdhury, Mohammad Hamdullah Sayeed, son of eight-term Lok Sabha member from Lakshadweep P.M. Sayeed, H.D. Kumaraswamy, son of former Prime Minister H.D. Deve Gowda, both former chief ministers of Karnataka, Neeraj Shekhar, son of former Prime Minister Chandra Shekhar, Jayant Chaudhury, grandson of former Prime Minister Charan Singh, Shruti Chowdhary, granddaughter of former Haryana chief minister Bansi Lal and daughter of Haryana tourism minister Kiran Choudhary, and Priya Dutt, daughter of former Congress MP Sunil Dutt.         
	Yet another member of the delegation, Ijyaraj Singh of the Congress, Lok Sabha member from Kota, is blue-blooded. He is a member of the Kota royal family.        
	Leading the team will be the chairperson of the India-US Forum of Parliamentarians, Abhishek Manu Singhvi, Congress MP and son of former BJP member of the Rajya Sabha L.M. Singhvi.        
	The visit of the young inheritors of Indian political dynasties will go down well in the US, where scores of similar dynasties control American politics from coast to coast.        
	In the chambers of the US Senate and the House of Representatives, it is difficult to take 10 steps without running into a member of one or other of Americas ubiquitous political dynasties.        
	The Kennedy and Bush stories are well known, but the Udall family from Americas west, for instance, now has two members of their political dynasty in the 100-member US Senate.        
	They are Senator Mark Udall, a Democrat from Colorado, and Senator Tom Udall, a Democrat from New Mexico. Senator Gordon Smith, a Republican from Oregon, also an Udall who uses a different last name, lost his bid for re-election last year in the Democratic wave for Barack Obama.        
	Similarly, John Salazar, a Democrat, has represented Colorado in the US House of Representatives for three terms. His brother, Ken Salazar, was the Senator from Colorado until a few months ago when president Obama appointed him to the cabinet as US secretary of the interior.        
	Virtually every US state has a story of one or more such dynasties in politics. So the interlocutors here for the visiting delegation will be extremely at home dealing with their mirror images from India.        
	Before arriving in Washington in about 10 days for the first Indo-US legislative interaction since the Lok Sabha elections, the MPs will provide a shot in the arm for Yales India initiatives.         
	The participation of several MPs in their 20s or early 30s  college enrolment years at the Ivy League institution  in an India-Yale Parliamentary Leadership Programme now in its third year, will help ensure that recession in the US will not affect the universitys India initiatives.        
	Yale has seen its endowments slide from $24 billion to $17.5 billion, but the excitement here over a generational change in Indian politics, reflected in the composition of the visiting delegation, will mean that its India programmes will, in fact, be augmented.        
	Sources at Yale said that if the team left in its wake an impression of excitement about Indian politics and the economy, a prestigious CEO Leadership Summit organised by Yales Chief Executive Leadership Institute twice a year, is likely to be held in India in November with the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry (Ficci) as a supporting partner.        
	It will be the first time that the summit, which brings together about 100 CEOs, will be held outside the US. In addition to their intense engagement of Senators and members of the House of Representatives, the MPs are to have discussions with a cross-section of leaders in the Obama administration at meetings to be also attended by Harsh Pati Singhania, president of Ficci and Amit Mitra, its secretary general.        
	The India-US Forum of Parliamentarians is supported by Ficci.

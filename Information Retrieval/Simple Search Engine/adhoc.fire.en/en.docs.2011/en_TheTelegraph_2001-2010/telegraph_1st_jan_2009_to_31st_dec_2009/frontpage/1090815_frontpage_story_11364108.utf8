The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Rebel camp destroyed in Dalma encounter
                                                                                                           Rebel camp destroyed in Dalma encounter
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Jamshedpur, Aug. 14: On the eve of Independence Day, a transit camp of the CPI(Maoist) was destroyed by security personnel in a two-hour encounter at Lotekocha jungle in the foothills of Dalma, 30km from here, at Patamda this evening.        
	State police, CRPF and Jharkhand Jaguar men conducted the joint operation that began around 6.30pm. No casualty has been reported on either side. Sources said rebel injury figures could be ascertained only after daybreak.         
	Superintendent of police, East Singhbhum, Naveen Kumar Singh said that they had information about the transit camp at Lotekocha.         
	About 25 Naxalites, including some new recruits, were lodged at the camp since the past three days. As the security team made its way to the spot, the rebels sensed trouble and started firing from their automatic guns, the SP said.        
	In retaliation, the security personnel fired a dozen mortars, besides more than 100 rounds of bullets. Four grenades were also lobbed. They were on a hill and, therefore, at an advantageous position. Our men retaliated by firing mortars and lobbing grenades. The rebels took a pause and then retreated firing indiscriminately, Singh said.        
	Since it was already dark, the police and paramilitary forces could not give a chase. The SP, however, hailed the operation as a big success for security forces in the wake of a rebel threat to mar I-Day celebrations across the state.

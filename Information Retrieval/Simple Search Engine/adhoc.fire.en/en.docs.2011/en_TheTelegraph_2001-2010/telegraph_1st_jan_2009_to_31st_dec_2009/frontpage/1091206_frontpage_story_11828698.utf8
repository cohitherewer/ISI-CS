          A STAFF REPORTER                                          
	Guwahati, Dec. 5: In a discreet move aimed at getting the much-anticipated talks with Ulfa off the ground, the Assam government has requested the Centre to devise a mechanism to incorporate the word sovereignty on the agenda for the proposed talks with the outfit.        
	Sources in Dispur said the government was of the view that there was no harm in having sovereignty in some form on the agenda as the Naga talks, too, had started in a similar manner 13 years ago.        
	In the meantime, we hope to convince Ulfa leaders how unreasonable their demand for a sovereign Asom is, a source in Dispur revealed.        
	The Centre is working on a greater autonomy package for the NSCN (I-M) though the outfit has not dropped its sovereignty demand, at least publicly. There are technical problems in including sovereignty but discussing it does not mean granting it. In the meantime, we hope to convince Ulfa leaders that sovereignty was not possible and then offer them the next best answer, one of the sources said.         
	He, however, added that including sovereignty would go against the Constitution as an elected government is sworn to protect the integrity and sovereignty of the country.        
	The sources pointed out that when the Naga talks got off, the operative word was unconditional talks which meant that both sides went ahead with all the issues raised by the outfit and even the objections by the government.        
	The Naga leaders had insisted that sovereignty was inalienable and Delhi had not made a fuss about those words, a source added.        
	The source pointed out that even after the Naga talks had started and the outfits leadership  Isak Chisi Swu and Th. Muivah  had arrived in Nagaland from abroad, they had publicly brandished their version of Nagalim by a writing on the base of their miniature flags Sovereignty is inalienable.        
	The source said that after the Naga outfit raised the pitch for integration of all Naga-inhabited areas, the issue of sovereignty had got diluted in a natural manner.        
	Given the secretive nature in which the Ulfa leaders were brought to the country, the delay in announcing whether they have been arrested/surrendered, producing them in court and chief minister Tarun Gogois public assertions that the state government would do everything possible for permanent peace only prove that hectic backroom parleys were on to ensure that the homecoming of Ulfa chairman Arabinda Rajkhowa was not frittered away, they said.        
	Addressing a panchayat convention in Goalpara, Gogoi today welcomed the arrival of the Ulfa leaders to the state and hoped that the development would be taken to its logical conclusion.         
	The Ulfa leaders have understood the futility of violence. It is a positive development and augurs well for the state, he said at the convention.

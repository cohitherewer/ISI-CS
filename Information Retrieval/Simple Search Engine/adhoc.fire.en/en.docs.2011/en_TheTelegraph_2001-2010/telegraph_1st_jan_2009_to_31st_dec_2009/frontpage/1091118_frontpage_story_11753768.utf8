	Ranchi, Nov. 17: The BJP is all set to embarrass Congress over the Madhu Koda affair in the winter session of Parliament beginning Thursday.        
	BJP president Rajnath Singh told The Telegraph over telephone from New Delhi that the issue would be raised in both Houses of Parliament.         
	We have to examine the corruption charges against Madhu Koda and the role of the Congress, he said, indicating a strategy to make the most of the corruption issue against its principal rival.        
	Singh said the Congress could not wash its hands of the Koda affair after having supported him for nearly two years.         
	It is necessary to disclose who all figure in Kodas diary, he said, suggesting it contained names of those who were beneficiaries of the alleged kickbacks received by the former chief minister while clearing mining leases.        
	According to party sources, the BJP would move an adjournment motion seeking details of Kodas diary entries on November 23-24 when the House convenes for regular business after the weekend.        
	The BJP, the sources hinted, would go to the extent of stalling proceedings if the Speaker refused to admit the motion for debate.        
	Raghubar Das, the state BJP president, said Koda could not have established business links in places like Mumbai, Thailand and Liberia on his own. There must be some big leaders who facilitated huge investments made by Koda and his associates, he maintained.        
	Singh maintained that Central intelligence agencies submitted regular reports to the Prime Ministers office on various states.         
	I dont know how the PMO remained silent all these years, he added.        
	Countering similar charges made by the Congress, the BJP chief said they were doing so out of political compulsion. They are suddenly dropping names like that of Munda (Arjun) since theres an election in Jharkhand. Why were they all silent so far? he said.        
	The BJP move, timed before the beginning of the first phase of polls on November 25, was meant to mount an offensive against the Congress, which is perceived to be on the backfoot after Koda threatened to reveal names behind a larger conspiracy.        
	The Congress leadership, it is understood, is particularly concerned about how Koda managed to persuade three JMM MPs to support the Manmohan Singh government during the July confidence vote in the Lok Sabha even though JMM chief Shibu Soren wasnt in favour of supporting the UPA.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Varun in communal comment storm
                                                                                                           Varun in communal comment storm
                          Varun Gandhi                    
	March 16 (PTI): Varun Gandhi, Sanjay Gandhis son and a BJP candidate, has been accused of making communal comments, prompting the Election Commission to issue a notice and his party to tick him off.        
	This is not a Hand (the Congresss symbol), it is the power of the Lotus (the BJPs symbol). It will cut the head of ****, Jai Shri Ram, the 29-year-old Varun was quoted as telling a meeting in Pilibhit, from where he is contesting his first election.         
	The constituency in Uttar Pradesh used to be represented by his mother Maneka Gandhi, who is estranged from the Nehru-Gandhi family, and is contesting from Aonla in the same state.        
	The complaint to the poll panel has been filed by the Congress.        
	The grandson of Indira Gandhi was quoted as telling another meeting: If anyone raises a finger towards Hindus or if someone thinks that Hindus are weak and leaderless, if someone thinks that these leaders lick our boots for votes, if anyone raises a finger towards Hindus, then I swear on the Gita that I will cut that hand.         
	The Congress, headed by Varuns aunt Sonia Gandhi, was quick to condemn the remarks as unethical and against law.        
	It is condemnable.... He (Varun) is associated with a party which has this ideology (anti-minority) and culture, Congress spokesperson Abhishek Singhvi told reporters in Delhi.        
	BJP leader Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi snubbed Varun, who is contesting his maiden election, saying the controversial speech was a manifestation of his familys past Congress culture and that his outburst did not reflect the BJPs traditional culture.        
	But Varun denied the charge in his reply submitted to district magistrate M.P. Agarwal.        
	The Election Commission charged Varun with the violation of the model code of conduct for elections on the Congress complaint.        
	Notices have been issued to the BJP candidate from Pilibhit and state unit president for their alleged communal remarks. They have been asked to submit their replies, an election official in Lucknow said.        
	An inquiry will be conducted by sub-divisional magistrate, Bisalpur, M.S. Akhtar.

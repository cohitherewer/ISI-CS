The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Pawar cuts Cong with Karat
                                                                                                           Pawar cuts Cong with Karat
          OUR BUREAU                            Pawar, Karat: Bhubaneswar bonhomie                                 
	New Delhi, April 1: UPA minister Sharad Pawar will share the dais with Prakash Karat on Friday, leaving the Congress little option but to grin and bear the discomfort because it had gifted its allies an escape hatch by ruling out a national alliance.        
	Pawar is the Congresss principal ally in Maharashtra. His party also partners the CPM in the Biju Janata Dal-led alliance in Orissa.        
	Having won a Lok Sabha ticket each from a grateful Naveen Patnaik, who dumped the BJP and squeezed himself through a trust vote with the help of his newfound secular allies, Pawar, Karat and CPIs A.B. Bardhan will address a joint rally in Bhubaneswar on Friday.        
	Not that the Congress needed any fresh jolt from Pawar he has been regularly tormenting his former party by dropping hints about being a contender for Prime Minister.        
	But the announcement of the public meeting with Karat will bite no less because a day before the Bhubaneswar bonding of Pawar and Karat, Sonia Gandhi is scheduled to launch her campaign meetings in Orissa.        
	It is unfortunate, said M. Veerappa Moily, the Congresss chief spokesperson, referring to the Pawar rally. The third front is not a partner of the UPA, we did not expect Pawar to do this.        
	But another leader said: We virtually created options for our allies by telling them they were free to do what they wished.        
	The Congress had set the bar on alliances by announcing in January that the UPA would not exist during the elections in its present form because the party wanted only state-level adjustments.         
	Four months ago, none of us thought Karats front had a chance. The Congress looked like the only choice for those parties who were uncomfortable with the BJP and the Left. But the BJDs exit from the NDA changed the dynamics, a Congress leader conceded.        
	Adding to the Congresss woes, Lalu Prasad, Mulayam Singh Yadav and Ram Vilas Paswan formed a ginger group.        
	Pawars team-up with the third front, although somewhat expected because of the alliance in Orissa, has compounded the Congresss worry on one count. What if we are forced to back its government to keep the BJP out? asked a general secretary.        
	The Congress has been hoping for a situation where it will emerge as the single largest party with enough numbers to persuade the Left and its allies to support it in the name of secularism.        
	With its stockpile of allies depleting, that of the third front increasing almost in inverse proportion and the BJP trying hard to polarise voters, the Congress is beginning to think that the outlook does not seem so pat any more, the sources said.

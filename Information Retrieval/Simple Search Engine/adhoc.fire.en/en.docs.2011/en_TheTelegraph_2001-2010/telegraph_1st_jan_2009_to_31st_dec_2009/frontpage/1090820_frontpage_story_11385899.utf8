The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Grandchildren claim Gayatri estate rights 
                                                                                                           Grandchildren claim Gayatri estate rights 
          RAKHEE ROY TALUKDAR                              Devraj (above) and Lalitya				                                 
	Jaipur, Aug. 19: Gayatri Devis grandchildren today claimed to be in possession of the former queens last will, which, they said, bequeaths to them all of her properties and estates worth at least Rs 1,000 crore.        
	In a statement, Devraj Kumar, 28, and his sister Lalitya Kumari, 30, said Gayatri Devis last will was left with her eldest stepson Bhawani Singh, who, they claimed, had handed over the document to them.        
	Devraj and Lalitya are the children of the maharanis only son, Jagat Singh, and Thai princess Priyanandana Rangsit. The couple divorced in 1987. Jagat Singh passed away in 1997. Devraj, who had so far refused to talk on the will, said he decided to make this public now after reports of a feud within the family.         
	Unfortunately while the family was in mourning and thereafter, certain unconfirmed reports were circulated in the media which has disturbed the family. In order to put an end to all speculation, we would like to announce that our grandmother Rajmata Gayatri Devi left behind her last Will in favour of us, giving us all her properties and rights. We are also the only natural legal heirs entitled to succeed to her estate. The last Will in our favour, which was left with his Highness Maharaja Sawai Bhawani Singhji of Jaipur, has since been handed over to us and the same is in the knowledge of all family members, says the statement, which was issued in the names of Maharaj Devraj and Rajkumari Lalitya from Lily Pool, one of the residences of Gayatri Devi. But what has raised eyebrows is Devrajs veiled appeal for support from his three step-uncles: Bhawani Singh, Jai Singh and Prithviraj Singh.         
	We sincerely hope to receive full support of all family members, namely HH Maharaj Sawai Bhawani Singh ji, Maharaj Jai Singh and Maharaj Prithviraj, says the statement, which is, however, not signed by either Devraj or Lalitya. Devraj later spoke to the media reaffirming what has been mentioned in the statement.        
	None of Gayatri Devis stepsons were willing to comment on the will or Devrajs statement. But at least one of them, Prithviraj, has earlier said he doesnt know whether the will exists or not. In case Gayatri Devi had not left behind a will, the entire property would have in any case passed on to Devraj and Lalitya.         
	Sources said the siblings were closer to Bhawani Singh than their other step-uncles.        
	Devraj, who holds an MBA degree, and Lalitya, who has studied history and architecture, used to spend their holidays in Jaipur while living with their mother in Thailand. But recently they have expressed their desire to come and stay in Jaipur and carry on the legacy of their grandmother.        
	Legal expert Panachand Jain, a former judge of Rajasthan High Court, said Devraj would have to prove the will in case there are other contenders. The will, he added, must have two attested signatories.         
	Jain pointed out that in Rajasthan, it was not necessary to probate the will (certifying the document under the seal of a competent court). Under Section 213 of the Indian Succession Act of 1925, probating a will is not necessary in states like Rajasthan (which were formed by merger of princely states).

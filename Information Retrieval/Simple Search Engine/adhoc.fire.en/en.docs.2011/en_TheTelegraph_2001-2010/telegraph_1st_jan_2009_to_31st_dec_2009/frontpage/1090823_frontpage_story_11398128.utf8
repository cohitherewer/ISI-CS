          OUR BUREAU                              
	Aug. 22: The Punjab government has terminated an agreement with Reliance Retail to set up a Rs 5,000-crore farm-to-fork project, possibly the first retail venture of Mukesh Ambani to be formally abandoned by a state.        
	The venture  once hailed as the harbinger of the second green revolution but jinxed from the start  had been firmed up in 2006 when a Congress government headed by Amarinder Singh was in power.        
	The Akali Dal and the BJP, now governing the state, had opposed the project then. When the new regime came to power in February 2007, Reliance had gone slow on the venture, fearing that the plug could be pulled any moment.        
	Reliance had faced opposition in Uttar Pradesh and Jharkhand, too, but the agreements were not scrapped. In Bengal, the group has opened some outlets but the comprehensive project is yet to take off.        
	It would have been untenable for the new government in Punjab to allow the project after opposing it earlier, a source said, terming the termination political.        
	The Punjab government said the company had not complied with the terms of the memorandum of understanding. The objective was to build farm infrastructure and deliver the produce to dining tables. The government had, in return, agreed to allot over 1,000 acres to Reliance Industries at a concessional rate.

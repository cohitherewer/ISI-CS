          G.C. SHEKHAR                            The scene of the collision near Chennai on Wednesday. (AP)                                  
	Chennai, April 29: At least one unidentified person took over a suburban train from the terminal station in Chennai at dawn, navigated it for six kilometres at high speed before ramming into a stationary goods train, leaving four dead and raising questions about security on tracks post 26/11.        
	The bizarre run, termed hijack by some baffled railway officials, began at Chennai Centrals suburban terminal at the Moore Market complex and lasted all of four minutes.        
	The nine-car suburban train (officially called Electrical Multiple Unit), scheduled to leave at 5.10am for Thiruvellore, 30km away, was on the platform. The driver, K. Karunanidhi, had gone to the washroom leaving the cabin unguarded with the ignition on.        
	This gap had been used by the miscreant or miscreants to drive away the train, said a railway official.        
	Around 4.50am, the train started moving, picked up speed, missed its first stop a kilometre away and switched to the main line from the suburban track. Travelling at around 90km an hour, it jumped tracks at Vyasarpadi Station, 6km away in the western suburbs, and collided into a goods train waiting to fill fuel at a nearby terminal.        
	Southern Railway general manager M.S. Jayanth said the train normally took eight minutes to reach Vyasarpadi. But today it took just four minutes, which meant we had little time to react to this emergency. Obviously someone in the know of operating this train started it in the high-speed mode. He must have been a well-informed miscreant, Jayanth said.        
	Theories  a drunkard out for a joyride, a disgruntled employee or even a suicide killer  abound on who was responsible for the disaster in which 11 people were also injured. A police officer said the terror angle was being probed given the feverish pitch raised on the issue of the Lankan Tamils.         
	The railways have identified one of the dead as M. Mohan Raj, a passenger and a former BPO worker. The identity of the other three is yet to be established.        
	Authorities pointed out that none of the four bodies was found in the motor-room  from where the driver operates  of the suburban train. But police said that since the motor-room is an extension of the first compartment and the whole unit was gutted, one of the four bodies could be that of the crazed driver.        
	Railway officials explained that it was difficult to abandon a train midway, leaving it to crash. The engine is put into motion by pushing a lever forward with four speed levels. If you remove the hand from the lever, it will bring the train to a halt. This is a safety measure in case the driver is unable to pilot the train or falls unconscious. So it is highly unlikely that anyone can simply drive a train at high speed and then jump off and make it crash, said a motorman with 15 years experience.        
	However, a railway engineer said he would not rule out the remote possibility of the engines drive mechanism getting jammed as the train gained speed very rapidly, something the engines are not subjected to normally.         
	These engines usually touch a maximum speed of 60km an hour and since they travel through heavily populated areas, the drivers accelerate them only gradually. Since we estimate the vehicle could have touched 90kmph, there was hardly any time for the staff at the next station (Basin Bridge), less than a kilometre away, to alert the following station or the control room, he explained.        
	Barely three months ago, the superfast Delhi-Ranchi Garib Rath Express had been taken over by two unauthorised drivers and driven to Lucknow.         
	A probe has established rivalry between warring drivers unions as the reason for the dangerous run, but no action has been taken so far.

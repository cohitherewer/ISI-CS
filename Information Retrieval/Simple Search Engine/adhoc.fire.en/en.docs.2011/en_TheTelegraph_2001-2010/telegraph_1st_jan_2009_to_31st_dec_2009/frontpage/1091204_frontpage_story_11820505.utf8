                                Mobile ensemble                            
	New York, Dec. 3 (Reuters): Welcome to an orchestra of the 21st century. iPhones are being used as musical instruments in a new course at an American university.        
	Students at the University of Michigan are learning to design, build and play instruments on their Apple Inc. smartphones with a public performance planned for December 9. The university said it believed the course, called Building a Mobile Phone Ensemble is a world-first. It is taught by Georg Essl, a computer scientist and musician who has worked on developing mobile phones and musical instruments.        
	Essl and his colleagues began using the microphone as a wind sensor a few years ago, which enabled iPhone apps such as the Ocarina that essentially turns the phone into an ancient flute-like wind instrument.         
	Were not tethered to the physics of traditional instruments. We can do interesting, weird, unusual things.This kind of technology is in its infancy, but its a hot and growing area to use iPhones for artistic expression.        
	Essl said to build an instrument on an iPhone, students programme the device to play back information it receives from one if its multitude of sensors as sound.

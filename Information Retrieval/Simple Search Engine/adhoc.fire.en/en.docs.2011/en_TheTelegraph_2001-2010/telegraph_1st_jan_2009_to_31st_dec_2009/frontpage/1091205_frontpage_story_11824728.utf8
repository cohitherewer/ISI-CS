The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | India lines up return gift of fugitives
                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                India lines up return gift of fugitives
          NISHIT DHOLABHAI                       Rajkhowa                          
	New Delhi, Dec. 4: Bangladeshs generosity in handing over leaders of the United Liberation Front of Asom springs from Prime Minister Sheikh Hasinas eagerness to see Sheikh Mujibur Rahmans assassins brought to justice, apart from her interest in smoothing relations with India.         
	Delhi is expected to return the favour to Dhaka by probably sending two persons wanted in the Mujib murder case who are lodged in Tihar jail, sources said. The duos identities are being kept under wraps though sources said their aliases could be Abud Mudib and Muslimuddin.         
	Mujib was assassinated by a group of junior army officers on August 15, 1975. After more than two decades, 12 of them were sentenced to death. Seven, however, escaped abroad and one of them is believed dead.         
	Two suspects are in India, having been arrested a few years ago for crimes committed here. During interrogation it was found that they were also responsible for the murder of the Bangladeshi leader, said a source.         
	They (Dhaka) have been asking us to hand them over for some time now and India is considering it actively, the source added.         
	If the duo are sent to Dhaka coinciding with Hasinas upcoming visit, it will be an apt response from India to the handover of Ulfa chairman Arabinda Rajkhowa and other leaders of the militant outfit. The gift had been held back because the Bangladesh National Party led by Khaleda Zia, which was seen as protecting the killers of Mujib, was in power in Dhaka.         
	Besides returning the Ulfa leaders to India, Bangladesh has promised to send back Ranjan Daimary of the National Democratic Front of Bodoland and Jeevan Singh of the Kamtapur Liberation Organisation, active in north Bengal.        
	Rajkhowa today surrendered with Ulfas deputy commander-in-chief Raju Barua at the Dawki border checkpost in Meghalaya, the BSF said.         
	The border force later handed over the Ulfa leaders and their families to Assam police who took custody of the group of 10 and took them to Guwahati via Shillong under tight security.        
	Hours after the surrender, Ulfa commander-in-chief Paresh Barua appealed to Rajkhowa to make his stand clear, honouring the sacrifice made by 12,000 martyrs and the hopes and aspirations of the people of the state.        
	He claimed that Rajkhowa and Raju Barua, along with a few others, have been in the Indian governments custody since December 2, which matches the unofficial version of the surrender.

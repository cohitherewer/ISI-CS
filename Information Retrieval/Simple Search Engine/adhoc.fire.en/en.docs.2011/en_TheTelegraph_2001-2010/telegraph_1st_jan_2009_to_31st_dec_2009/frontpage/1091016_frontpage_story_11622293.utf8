          SANJAY K JHA                            R.K. Anand                                  
	New Delhi, Oct. 15: The 34th National Games appears to have been postponed primarily because Indian sports officials are tied down by the Commonwealth Games preparations which is a real mess.         
	Sources say the Centre okayed the idea as it did not want to run the risk of handling a heightened Naxalite threat to the National Games at a time when its prime objective was to hold a peaceful election.         
	The postponement of the Games, fifth in a row, also suits the Congress politically as the BJP had accused it of giving greater importance than the installation of a democratically-elected government.         
	The Congress high command, which is alive to the pathetic state of affairs in its Jharkhand unit  as is its general secretary Rahul Gandhi who ended his two-day visit to the state today  apprehended negative political fallout of a major untoward incident during the Games. The best option was to leave the sporting event in the hands of the next government.         
	The National Games was to be held between November 21 and December 5. It is unlikely that electioneering would have started by then as the Congress expects polls sometime in late December or early January only. The new Assembly in Jharkhand is to be constituted before January 19.        
	This gives credence to speculation that the postponement had more to do with preoccupation with the Commonwealth Games than the electoral process.         
	Indian Olympic Association chief Suresh Kalmadi, however, asserted that the reason was only election and the decision had been taken in consultation with the Union government.         
	The Centre is also worried about the fate of the Commonwealth Games and the election excuse might have come handy in putting off the national games.         
	Sources said both the government and Kalmadi were well aware of the clash between the election and the national games and nothing new had occurred in the last few months causing this last minute hiccup.

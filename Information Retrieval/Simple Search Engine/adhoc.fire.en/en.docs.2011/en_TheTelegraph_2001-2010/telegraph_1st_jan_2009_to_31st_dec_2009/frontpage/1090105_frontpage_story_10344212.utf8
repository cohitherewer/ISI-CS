The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Hindi shield against hadsa
                                                                                                           Hindi shield against hadsa
                                            
	Pune, Jan. 4: If you misuse the Hindi word for accident, accidents are what might happen to you, R.R. Patil has realised.        
	The Nationalist Congress Party leader, who claims he lost his job as Maharashtra home minister over a slip of the tongue, today said he would take a refresher course in Hindi.        
	After the November 26 Mumbai attacks, Patil was quoted as saying: Itne bade shahar me ekadh hadsa ho jata hai (in such a big city, an accident or two can happen).        
	The Urdu/Hindi word hadsa can mean an accident or mishap or (minor) incident, and Patil was reviled for downplaying the scale of the tragedy.        
	His party chief Sharad Pawar quickly put it down to Patils poor knowledge of Hindi, a view the former home minister repeated today.        
	Many may argue, however, that if Patil had indeed meant to say tragedy or disaster (tabahi), he wouldnt have said ekadh ho jata hai.        
	Patil revealed that his motivation to brush up on his Hindi had increased after a new development: When I took over as the chief of the NCPs Maharashtra unit last week, I was also appointed chairman of the state Rashtrabhasha Prachar Samiti.        
	The NCP leader didnt seem worried that all this talk of a Maratha yearning to learn Hindi might upset Raj Thackeray and spark a few hadsas by his goons. Thackeray is prone to stress the converse  that Hindi-speakers in Maharashtra learn Marathi.        
	One reason could be that Patil was speaking in hometown Sangli, not an itne bade shahar as Mumbai. Patil himself hinted at a second, deeper reason: Hindi was crucial to his future political career.        
	That was apparently what his boss too had thought after Rajiv Gandhis assassination in 1991. Pawar, nursing dreams of becoming Prime Minister, apparently took Hindi lessons but was edged out by P.V. Narasimha Rao, a polyglot as comfortable in Spanish as in Hindi or Telugu.        
	Big Brushoff        
	Not even a hadsa, however, will bring Amitabh Bachchan face to face with Mumbai attacker Mohammed Ajmal Kasab. The actor has said the idea fills him with repulsion.        
	I read news reports that during investigation he expressed a desire to meet me and watch my films. I... sought views from fellow bloggers. Fifty per cent respondents felt that I should meet him while the remaining were against such an idea, he said yesterday.        
	Considering the ruthlessness and mercilessness of the carnage, there is repulsion.                    WRITTEN WITH A PTI REPORT

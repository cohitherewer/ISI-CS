	Argul (Jatni), Feb. 12: Some 57 years after the idea germinated, Orissas long-cherished dream of an Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) came true as chief minister laid the foundation stone for IIT, Bhubaneswar, today.         
	During 1950-51 when the Centre decided to set up four IITs across the country, Orissa was a serious contender. After a wait of more than 50 years finally the state has received what it deserves, said the additional secretary of Union HRD ministry Ashok Thakur.         
	While laying the foundation stone, chief minister Naveen Patnaik welcomed the move.         
	I had consistently pursued the IIT dream since 2003, he said. My government has allotted 935 acres free to the institute and steps are being taken to provide infrastructure facilities such as water, power and roads as soon as possible, he added.         
	A pipeline will be laid from Naraj for the campus water supply from the Mahanadi and the technical school would also get its dedicated grid sub-station. The government, from its own resources, would realign the road leading to the school.         
	Till date, IIT, Bhubaneswar, has been running from the IIT, Kharagpur, campus (from July 2008) and has 120 students. Now, within the next two years a sprawling 935-acres-wide campus would be ready, hoped director Damodar Acharya.         
	Necessary facilities are also being created in the extension campus of IIT, Kharagpur, at Bhubaneswar where classes would started for the next academic session from July, 2009.         
	When finished the IIT, Bhubaneswar, is expected to accommodate 10,000 students and reflect an architecture that reflects Orissas cultural heritage. A science park would also be set up on the campus with support from industries.         
	Recruitment for the faculty is on and interviews would be started within a week.         
	Previously, Union HRD minister Arjun Singh was supposed to lay the foundation stone, but as he could not make it to the programme the chief minister replaced him to do the honours.         
	The Centre is also planning to set up a central university, a national university, Indian Institute of Information Technology and polytechnics in Orissa during 11th plan period.

                                                                                                           7000 bullets, pistols found in city house 
          OUR BUREAU                                        
	Jan. 25: Seven thousand bullets and several firearms have been found in a house not far from VIP Road, the Republic Day-eve trail snaking to the city from a government guesthouse in Malda where six suspected arms dealers found shelter.        
	The ammunition and weapons, some apparently sophisticated, have been seized from a three-storey house in Baguiati, the site a kilometre from the highway slicing a neighbourhood that has seen an explosion of construction of flats.         
	We have so far found at least 7,000 rounds of bullets and cartridges and 15 improvised and sophisticated pistols and revolvers, said S.N. Gupta, deputy inspector-general, CID.         
	Sources said more raids were expected in the city supposed to be on high alert for Republic Day.        
	The CID said two men had been detained from the house, described as old but surrounded by middle-income-group flats.        
	One of the detained persons has been identified as Anup Chowdhury, the owner of the house. A wholesale trader dealing in fish and textiles, Chowdhury has been residing there for 10 years, according to neighbours.        
	The arms were found in lockers inside a ground-floor office that is no longer in use. Officials said at midnight that investigations were still on to establish the motive behind stashing such a huge quantity of ammunition in a residential neighbourhood.         
	Police feel that Maoists and crime lords could have been the potential buyers. A Nandigram angle was also introduced with the police claiming that the same gang had sold weapons to Maoists linked to the land protest.        
	With the shadow of Mumbai attacks still looming large, rumours flew that rocket launchers and a white powder had also been found. However, the CID denied knowledge of such seizures.        
	The house raid at 8.30pm was based on information provided by the suspected arms dealers picked up in Malda before dawn. The CID team had brought the alleged arms kingpin and another Baguiati resident, Ashok Mandal, with them.        
	The six alleged arms dealers apparently got access to two rooms at the guesthouse in Maldas Harishchandrapur after a woman employed at the block office introduced one of them as her brother to the block development officer over the phone.        
	Nabanita Sharmas brother Biswajit Das went to the guesthouse on Thursday to book the rooms. The rest of the gang, including Ashok, reached the day after.        
	An inquiry has been ordered to find out why BDO Norbu Shering Lepcha had allowed six men whom he did not know to stay at the guesthouse.         
	The police said Biswajits real name was Kamal Krishna Das. Nabanita is also from the Rajarhat area of North 24-Parganas, where Das lives. We are trying to find out why she identified him as her brother and gave a fictitious name, said CID officer Gupta.        
	Police said Ashok, 45, a resident of Baguiati, took the five others  all in their forties  to settle a deal with a new client. The driver of their hired Tata Sumo has been held.         
	Ashok had been arrested in 2003 for allegedly supplying arms to criminals but jumped bail and fled, a CID officer said. Ashok confirmed that he sold arms and ammunition to Maoists fighting against land acquisition in Nandigram, the officer said.

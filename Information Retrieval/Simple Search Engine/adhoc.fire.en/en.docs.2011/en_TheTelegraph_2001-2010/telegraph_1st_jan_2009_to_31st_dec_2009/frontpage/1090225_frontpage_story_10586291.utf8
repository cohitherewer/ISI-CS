The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Razi steps in to save Ghatkuri
                                                                                                           Razi steps in to save Ghatkuri
          AMIT GUPTA                                              
	Ranchi, Feb. 24: Governor Syed Sibtey Razi today ordered that the famed Ghatkuri mines in West Singhbhum be reserved for public sector undertakings (PSUs), thereby reversing a hasty move by the Shibu Soren government to allow six private firms access to the prized iron ore reserves.        
	Highly placed sources in the administration revealed the state mines and geology department would now file an application with the Supreme Court before the next hearing on March 3, clarifying its latest stand on the controversial issue.        
	A revision petition will be filed in the apex court before March 3 which would be contrary to the earlier affidavit filed during the Soren regime that was in favour of allocating a better portion of the valuable reserves to six private companies, said a senior official.         
	The petition would highlight earlier mistakes and everything would be left to the court for further action, he added.        
	The Telegraph had reported on February 6 that after the imposition of Presidents Rule, the state mines department asked the governor to spike the Soren governments order that would allow the six private firms access to the much sought-after reserves bypassing over 150 applicants.        
	The Ghatkuri mines, considered only second to Chiria in terms of quality of deposits, has been reserved for PSUs through three notifications by earlier governments in 1962, 1969 and 2006.        
	The six private firms who were supposed to be benefited by the Soren governments move include Monnet Ispat and Energy Limited, Jharkhand Ispat Limited, Prakash Ispat Limited, Adhunik Alloys and Power Limited, Abhijeet Infrastructure Limited and Ispat Industries Limited.         
	Except for Monet Ispat, all have been allotted iron-ore mines elsewhere.         
	Against the Soren governments affidavit in the apex court (filed on December 15), steel majors like ArcelorMittal, Tata Steel, JSW Steels Jharkhand Limited and Roongta Mines intervened in the matter. Moreover, two PSUs National Mineral Development Corporation (NMDC) and Steel Authority of India Limited (SAIL) also intervened.         
	But opinion within the industry was almost unanimous that the mines so far reserved for PSUs could not be handed over to private players unless first de-reserved through a gazette notification and thrown open to all applicants.

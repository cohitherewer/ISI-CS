The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | PM picks Amartya acolyte as adviser 
                                                                                                           PM picks Amartya acolyte as adviser 
          SANKARSHAN THAKUR                       Kaushik Basu                          
	New Delhi, Sept. 6: Prime Minister Manmohan Singh has effected a key lateral entry into his expanding technocracy by bringing in acclaimed economist Kaushik Basu as chief economic adviser to the finance ministry.         
	Government sources confirmed to The Telegraph that Kaushik, currently a C. Marks Professor of International Studies and Professor of Economics at Cornell University, had been persuaded to take the job that Prime Minister Singh himself held between 1972 and 1976.         
	Basu is a known Amartya Sen acolyte and completed his doctoral thesis on Revealed Preference of Government under Sens supervision in 1976. Basu is the second big-ticket inductee into government after Nandan Nilekani, who assumed charge as chairman of the Unique Identification Authority of India earlier this month, and brings on board top-flight economic expertise at a time the UPA government is setting its sights high on development upgrade.        
	The prospect of his arrival has the economic establishment already rippling with excitement. Interesting pick, said economist and Planning Commission member Abhijit Sen. It does the government proud and locates it internationally, although I am not sure Basu has followed the Indian economy day after day, year after year, because he is not an empirical economist, he is a big-picture man, a broad sweep, top-view man. But looking back the years, I cant seem to see a chief economic adviser as good as him.        
	Basu is known among his peers as an intellectual-academic rather than as a practitioner, and that may well have made him a preferred choice in the eyes of the Prime Minister.        
	As one top Delhi academician put it: Basu, along with Amartya Sen among the big names, shares a worldview with the Prime Minister, a common sense of where we are, what we need to do, where we want to head; practising economists can often not be detached enough to take in and expound on the larger picture.        
	How this latest entrant to the Prime Ministers league of extraordinary gentlemen fits into the scheme will have to be a function of time. Basu is known not to be pushy or aggressive and is, therefore, expected not to disrupt the furniture at the finance ministry or have run-ins with his boss, Pranab Mukherjee; on the contrary they might make something of their cultural synergy, both sharing Bengali roots.         
	Intellectually, and gradually on decision-making, though, Kaushik Basu may begin to outweigh the Planning Commission deputy chairman, Montek Singh Ahluwalia, the other Singh-appointed pillar of policy.         
	Although some among his contemporaries are surprised Basu has decided to give up the West and return to India, many see his decision as something that was coming, or was natural. Part of that sense comes from Basus self-professed and rather unabashed praise for Manmohan Singhs leadership.        
	Following the UPAs return to power this year, Basu wrote a signed column for the BBCs website foregrounding Singh as the chief victory factor. It is unlikely that Manmohan Singh will agree with me, but I believe that the Congress won the election not because of the Congress but because of Manmohan Singh.        
	Basu wrote: It is rare to have a politician who is not a politician and is actually bad at politicking  someone who is plain  speaking, honourable and intelligent. Such people do not usually survive the rough and tumble of politics, let alone be Prime Minister. India is lucky that such a person has.         
	The highly personalised tract also recalled the beginnings of their friendship in the early 1980s, when Basu taught economics in Delhi and Manmohan Singh was in between jobs  retired as secretary of the department of economic affairs and yet to become governor of the Reserve Bank.        
	A friend of mine called to ask if he could bring Manmohan Singh  I knew of him as an economist and he was already prominent as a policy technocrat  to take a look at our flat. He was looking to buy a simple apartment, my friend explained. I subsequently got to know Manmohan Singh well enough to know that that would indeed be his preference.         
	Basu was born in Calcutta and schooled at St Xaviers. In 1969, he moved to Delhi to do his undergraduate studies in Economics from St Stephens College and proceeded to the London School of Economics, from where he received his MSc in Economics in 1974.        
	Over the years, Basu has held visiting positions at the Institute for Advanced Study (Princeton), CORE (Louvain-la-Neuve) and the London School of Economics (where he was Distinguished Visitor in 1993); he has been visiting professor at MIT, Harvard and Princeton; and visiting scientist at the Indian Statistical Institute.         
	A fellow of the Econometric Society and recipient of the Padma Bhushan as well as the Mahalanobis Memorial Medal, Basu has published scientific papers in development economics and game theory, industrial organisation and political economy.        
	He is also the editor of the Oxford Companion to Economics in India, which is a compendium on the Indian economy, with contributors that include P. Chidambaram, Amartya Sen, Ratan Tata and N.R. Narayana Murthy.

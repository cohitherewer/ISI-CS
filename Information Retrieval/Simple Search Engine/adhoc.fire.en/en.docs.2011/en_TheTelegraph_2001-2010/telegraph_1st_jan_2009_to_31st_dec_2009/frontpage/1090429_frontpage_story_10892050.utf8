          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                               
	New Delhi, April 28: The CBI pursed its lips on Bofors accused Ottavio Quattrocchis name being dropped from Interpols wanted list, but the Congress lashed out against allegations that it was responsible for the decision.        
	The red corner notice against the Italian businessman was dropped on the CBIs advice on April 24, sources said.         
	As the BJP raked up the Bofors issue again, Priyanka Gandhi led the Congress charge. Absolutely not. Its out of question, she retorted when asked about the BJPs allegation that the Congress had pressured the CBI.        
	The sources said the CBI went by the counsel of attorney-general Milon Banerjee, whom it had approached in October since the five-year notice against Quattrocchi was due to expire. Banerjee pointed to the CBIs failed attempts to get the accused extradited from Malaysia and Argentina  in 2003 and 2007  and said there was no basis for the notice to continue.         
	Red corner notices are issued by the Interpol on a countrys request to help extradite an accused wanted by that country. In spite of the notice, Quattrocchi was not extradited because of lack of evidence.        
	A senior UPA minister said the Interpol had asked India why a man was being harassed without evidence. However, this could not be independently confirmed.        
	L.K. Advani and Arun Jaitley of the BJP alleged the government had tried to bury the truth about Bofors.         
	But 20 years after it lost an election over allegations of Rs 64-crore payoffs and five years after a court found Rajiv Gandhi innocent, the Congress was not defensive. It said it had nothing to do with Quattrocchi, described as a friend of the Gandhis, and if there was proof, the NDA should have acted when it was in power.         
	Congress sources said their leaders  Manmohan Singh, Sonia Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi  had an unblemished reputation and there was no scam against the UPA government.         
	I amp;B minister Anand Sharma reminded Jaitley that as additional solicitor-general in the V.P. Singh government, he had gone all over Europe with two other officials to look for Bofors proof. They stayed in luxurious hotels, spent millions of dollars but came up with nothing. As law minister (in the Vajpayee government), Jaitley could not even produce a dead rat, Sharma said.         
	Attorney-general Banerjee was unavailable for comment.         
	The CBI said it has taken action on the basis of legal advice of the highest order. We will inform the competent court on the next date of hearing, that is, 30 April.

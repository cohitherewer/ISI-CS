	Paris, June 7: Some questions are best answered by those who ask them.        
	Am I the greatest of all time? Roger Federer asked this afternoon at Roland Garros, soon after beating Robin Soderling, tying Pete Sampras and winning the French Open at last.        
	Comparing greatness is a complicated business. But Federer did not shy of fielding his own question. We dont know, but I definitely have many things going for me because Ive finally won all four Grand Slams, and Im particularly happy reaching Petes 14, Federer said.        
	Comparisons across tennis eras are risk-prone because the game was long divided into the amateur and the professional, with professionals unable to compete in the Grand Slam tournaments until the sport went open in 1968.        
	But with the French Open title now in his possession, a strong case can be made for Federer in the inevitable debate over who deserves to be considered the greatest player ever, though todays contest was not a classic.        
	To me hes the best player in history, he really deserved to win here, said Soderling, the 23rd seed who defeated Rafael Nadal in the fourth round and was playing in his first Grand Slam final.        
	Sampras said Federer deserves to be at the top of the all-time list. Im obviously happy for Roger, Sampras told the Associated Press in a telephone interview from Los Angeles, where he lives. Now that he has won in Paris, I think it just more solidifies his place in history as the greatest player that played the game, in my opinion.        
	Federer has won the Australian Open three times, Wimbledon five times and the US Open five times. But the French Open had always eluded him thanks mainly to Nadal, who beat him in the semifinals in 2005 and in the final the last three years.        
	In his mind, as Federer imagined over the years and the frustration what it would be like to finally win the French Open, it was probably not quite like this.        
	How could Federer have imagined that the obstacle across the net in one of the most important matches of his life would be Soderling, a relatively anonymous Swede, instead of Nadal, his left-handed Spanish nemesis?        
	How could Federer have imagined that with him cruising comfortably early in the second set on Sunday, an intruder would jump out of the stands and onto the clay, run towards him and drape a flag over Federers head, leaving the Swiss champion shaken?            FEDERER rsquo;S 14      
	The Grand Slams won by Roger Federer    French Open: 2009  Wimbledon: 2003-07  US Open: 2004-08  Australian Open: 2004, 06-07        Total 14 equalling   Pete Sampras      
	How could he have imagined that, on top of all the pent-up pressure and imminent tennis history already weighing upon him, that he and Soderling would also have to deal with some of the worst weather ever experienced during a major singles final?        
	No, it was all quite unexpected, but Federer, to his enduring credit, shrugged it all off and kept his eye on the one big prize he was lacking to win, 6-1, 7-6, 6-4.        
	This could be my biggest victory, the one that takes off the most pressure, said Federer, who dropped to his knees on the clay after he had secured victory. Now I can play in peace for the rest of my career and never hear again that I never won the French Open.        
	The victory gave Federer, 27, a complete set of Grand Slam singles titles and allowed him to tie the career record of 14 major singles titles held by Sampras. But Sampras never won the French Open, the only one of the four major tournaments staged on clay, and Federer is now one of only six men to have won all the Grand Slam titles during his career.        
	The others are Don Budge, Fred Perry, Roy Emerson, Rod Laver and Andre Agassi, the American who surprisingly won the title here 10 years ago and presented the trophy to Federer today.        
	Youre the last man to win all four Grand Slams, Federer told Agassi. Now I can relate to what it really feels like. ...It feels good to be for once on the podium as the winner. Its a magical moment.

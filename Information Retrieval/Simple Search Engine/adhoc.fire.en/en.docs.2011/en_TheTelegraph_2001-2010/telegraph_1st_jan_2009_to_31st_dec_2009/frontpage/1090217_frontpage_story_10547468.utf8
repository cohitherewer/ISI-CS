          OUR BUREAU                                            
	New Delhi, Feb. 16: Stand-in finance minister Pranab Mukherjee shovelled Rs 131,000 crore into a clutch of job-creating social welfare schemes for the masses as the outgoing coalition readied for the general election.        
	Mukherjee  the longest-serving Congress minister  stuck to convention and announced no tax breaks or stimulus measures for industry in todays interim budget that capped almost five years of governance by the UPA.        
	The Prime Minister, recuperating after a bypass surgery, termed it a peoples budget and chanted the key word of the UPA mantra: the aam aadmi.         
	I have no doubt that the continued stimulus for the various flagship programmes of the government will provide relief to all sections  especially the aam aadmi, Manmohan Singh said in a statement.        
	If any aam aadmi had any doubt who the benefactor is, Mukherjee squeezed a handy tip into the interim budget speech. I have no doubt when the time comes, the people will recognise the hand that made it all possible, the veteran said, prompting the Opposition to claim that he was referring to the Congresss anatomical election symbol.        
	The presentation of the vote on account  which sought funds for four months till a new government is in place  turned into a long litany of achievement and a short statement of intention by the UPA to revive a stuttering economy if it is voted back to power.        
	Extraordinary economic circumstances merit extraordinary measures. Now is the time for such measures, Mukherjee said fairly early into his speech, creating a tingle of excitement over a widely anticipated third stimulus package of measures.         
	But it wasnt to be.        
	Mukherjee left the task to the next government to devise a pump-priming programme that would kick-start an economy that is projected to grow 7.1 per cent this year.        
	In his statement, the Prime Minister described the budget as a fine balancing act between the need to revive the economy and the constitutional constraints of a pre-election budget.         
	Sources said the unreliability of restive allies such as Samajwadi Party in getting proposals cleared in the Lok Sabha might also have prompted the government to play safe.        
	The sensex fell 3.4 per cent and industry tried hard to conceal its disappointment. The present government could have at least set an agenda for the next government. We expected some stimulus measures, said Phiroz Adi Vandrevala, executive director of Tata Consultancy Services.        
	Policy mandarins were quick to defend the government. The government did not want to take policy decisions that could almost be binding in a way on the next government, said Arvind Virmani, chief economic adviser to the government. He (Mukherjee) has followed the path of constitutional propriety, added economic affairs secretary Ashok Chawla.        
	North Block officials said they expected the RBI to announce monetary measures later this month to bail out industry.                      
	Tucked away in the budget papers was a figure of significance in the coming months: the Lok Sabha elections will cost the exchequer Rs 850 crore  a 3.8 per cent increase over the cost of elections in 2004.        
	Muddled finances        
	The governments finances are in a muddle with its fiscal deficit projected to balloon to 6 per cent of the gross domestic product from an earlier forecast of 3.1 per cent.        
	In last years budget, the government had intended to cap fiscal deficit at 2.5 per cent. The target went haywire because of the Rs 71,700-crore farm loan waiver last June, the 21 per cent average pay hike for civil servants in September, and Rs 40,000 crore worth of tax benefits industry received to deal with the downturn.        
	For the second time in five years, the government announced it wouldnt be able to show financial rectitude by sticking to the tough targets enshrined in the Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management Act (FRBM) which calls for the elimination of the revenue deficit by March 31.

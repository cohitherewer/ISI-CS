  - Footwork of another kind for Aila victims           VIVEK CHHETRI                                                     
	Darjeeling, June 14: Bhaichung Bhutia and his choreographer Sonia rocked Gymkhana Club here with their hip-grinding, feet-tapping rendition of a number from Jung to help victims of the May 26 landslides and to thank people for voting him the winner in a dance reality show on television.         
	What was supposed to be a low-key felicitation followed by an auction of Bhaichungs on-field gear and footballs became a full house with residents of Darjeeling turning up in huge numbers to welcome their hero.         
	They screamed, jived to the music and took hundreds of photographs from the moment Bhaichung and Sonia alighted from his custom made red Scorpio with the number plate WB06-0015. Bhaichung has always donned jersey 15 while representing any football team.         
	One and five seem to be the magic number indeed.                     
	The ace footballer has decided to donate Rs 1.5 lakh for the relief work in Darjeeling and two of the three 15 numbered jerseys fetched Rs 22,100 within half-an-hour of being put to the gavel. The orange-and-blue jerseys had been worn by Bhaichung in the Asia Football Championship in 2008 when India qualified after 25 years for Asian Cup. The third white-and-blue jerseyworn by Bhutia during the Nehru Cup which India had won after 10 years in 2007  went out for Rs 13,000. The auction fetched just over Rs 60,000 in addition to Bhaichungs donation.         
	At the end of the day, when Bhaichung and Sonia swayed to Yaayla reAaila, Rs 2.1 lakh had already been collected. Nine footballs personally autographed by Bhutia were also up for grabs.         
	The footballs were auctioned through silent biddingwhere people had to denote their bids through secret ballots). The jerseys on the other hand were put on conventional British bidding: the buyers stood up and quoted the price starting from a reserve bid of Rs 5,001.         
	People vied with each other taking it on their personal egos to increase the stake by Rs 100 each, but all for a cause.         
	Both Sonia and Bhaichung talked about their concern for the people who died during the recent landslides and a minutes silence was observed in their memory.         
	But none could take Bhaichung out of his football. There is huge talent in Darjeeling. Many are playing in Calcutta too and I promise to extend all kind of support to budding footballers in Darjeeling, he said before promising another Rs 30,000 more to Bhaichung Fan Club to hold a soccer tournament here.         
	 I just cannot dance, he said while talking about his winning performance aired by a satellite channel.         
	Earlier in the day, Bhaichung and Sonia, regaled a packed Town Hall in Kalimpong, where they had stopped over on their way here. They did the same Yaayla reAaila duet there and Sonia floored all with a saucy rendition of the raunchy Bidi number from Omkara. Two factors played a big role in my winning the dance contest: one was Sonia, my choreographer and the second, you the people from this region, Bhaichung said while thanking all at Kalimpong.

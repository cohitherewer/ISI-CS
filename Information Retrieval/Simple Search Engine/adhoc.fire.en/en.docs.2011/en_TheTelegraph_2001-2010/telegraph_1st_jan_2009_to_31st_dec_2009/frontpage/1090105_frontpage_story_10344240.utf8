The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Plan to bail out trainee teachers
                                                                                                           Plan to bail out trainee teachers
          CHARU SUDAN KASTURI                              
	New Delhi, Jan. 4: The Centre is relying on executive powers available to the National Council for Teacher Education chairman to bail out around 75,000 trainee teachers from Bengal courses labelled illegal by Calcutta High Court.        
	The NCTE has dusted off a rarely used clause in regulations to try and salvage the careers of trainees affected by the court order. But it must walk a tightrope to avoid charges of contempt of court.        
	Officials have said the Centre plans to use section 1.10 of the NCTE (Recognition and Norms Procedure) Regulations, 2005. The clause, titled power to relax, allows the NCTE chief to relax any of the provisions of these regulations in respect of any class or category of institutions.        
	The clause clarifies that the chairman can only take this step relating to institutions from a particular state or Union territory if the state government appeals on grounds of removal of hardship. This clause is suited to the Bengal case, an official said.        
	The move follows intense pressure on the human resource development (HRD) ministry and the NCTE to intervene in a case that has united most parties. What is yet to be decided, the officials said, is the extent to which the chairman has to relax norms.        
	An argument against the unrecognised courses is that they are merely a year long, sources said. The NCTE has stipulated that such courses must be of two-year duration.

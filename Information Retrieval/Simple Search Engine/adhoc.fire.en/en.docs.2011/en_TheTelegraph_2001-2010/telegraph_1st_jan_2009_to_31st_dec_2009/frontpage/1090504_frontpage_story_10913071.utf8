The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Spectre of a soft coup
                                                                                                           Spectre of a soft coup
          K.P. NAYAR                       Katuwal, Prachanda (below)				                                       
	Washington, May 3: Close on the heels of a spillover of Indian diplomacy in Colombo on the election in Tamil Nadu, a similar challenge is unfolding in Nepal with implications on both sides of the border.         
	Within hours of sacking Nepals army chief General Rukmagat Katuwal today, Prime Minister Prachanda has been forced to commit ideological heresy for the second time in as many days.        
	Prachanda was to have begun a high-profile visit yesterday to China, the country which was the inspiration for his Maoist insurgency, but the trip has been cancelled with the likelihood of a soft coup over the dismissal of the army chief actually ousting the revolutionary Prime Minister from office instead.        
	On May 1, Prachanda committed another heresy for a communist: minutes after Indian ambassador Rakesh Sood met the Prime Minister and urged him not to dismiss the army chief, Prachanda cancelled his address to a May Day rally and, instead, went into a six-hour huddle with close comrades at a scenic location 30km outside the capital.        
	But Nepals coalition government, midwifed by India last year, is facing collapse, notwithstanding Prachandas huddle and his decision to remain in the country instead of going to Beijing.        
	General Katuwal has stayed put in his office and not obeyed Prachandas dismissal orders. Instead, he met the armys top brass to decide on a common course of action.        
	General Katuwal is expected to approach the courts for relief. His brother officers are likely to back him. Katuwal had already ensured their loyalty by recommending extensions in service to eight retiring brigadiers general, a recommendation Prachanda rejected. That issue is already in court.        
	The second biggest ruling coalition partner, the Communist Party of Nepal (United Marxist-Leninist) or CPN-UML, quit the alliance tonight on the ground that Prachanda acted like a dictator without seeking the approval of his coalition partners to dismiss Katuwal.        
	It is likely that three more coalition partners, the Madhesi Janadhikar Forum, the Nepal Sadbhavana Party and Communist Party of Nepal (United), will follow suit.         
	The first two of these three partners have influence on the Indian side of Nepals border and vice-versa: their stand on a crisis in Nepal can influence voting patterns in Indian pockets contiguous to Nepal.         
	Several non-Maoist ministers walked out of a cabinet meeting that decided to dismiss the army chief.         
	The Maoists have only 238 seats in the Nepals 601-member parliament. Nepals President, Ram Baran Yadav, belongs to the Nepali Congress.        
	On the face of it, Prachanda is facing a losing battle over the army chief. If he brings Katuwals dismissal before the parliament, the order may be voted out because the Maoists are isolated on the issue. If he takes the matter to the President, Yadav is expected to reject the order.         
	Worst of all, the Supreme Court may decide that Katuwals dismissal by the Prime Minister  and not the President  is unconstitutional as claimed by the army chief himself.

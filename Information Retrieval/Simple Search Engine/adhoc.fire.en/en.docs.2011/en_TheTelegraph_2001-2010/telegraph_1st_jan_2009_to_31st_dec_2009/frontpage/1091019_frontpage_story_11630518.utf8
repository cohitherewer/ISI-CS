The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | CBI cell to assist vigilance
                                                                                                           CBI cell to assist vigilance
          RUDRA BISWAS                              
	Ranchi, Oct. 18: The state vigilance department has decided to create a special cell of retired CBI officials to enable it to investigate better a number of high-profile cases that have been piling up.        
	The cell, which is expected to add more teeth to the functioning of the vigilance department, will comprise two SP rank officers of the CBI who would be supported by six deputy SPs and six inspector rank officials.         
	The idea is to lend more teeth to ongoing investigations, IG (vigilance) M.V. Rao said. The department has so long been managing its affairs with its own resources and employees. However, with an increase in the number of cases being referred to us in addition to the growing number of public complaints, we need the help of specialised personnel, Rao, under whom the CBI cell will be functioning, said.        
	Among the many high-profile cases being looked into by the vigilance department are disproportionate assets cases against former chief minister Madhu Koda and three of his cabinet colleagues, Bhanu Pratap Shahi, Bandhu Tirkey and Kamlesh Singh.        
	This apart, the vigilance department is also probing cases of corruption and nepotism against the chairman and members of JPSC, a racket in the unlawful sale of ayurveda, homeopath and unani doctors positions, Ranchi land scam cases with senior IAS officers S.S.Verma and Sudhir Prasad as accused and RRDA cases.                    
	Besides, the vigilance department is also burdened with several hundred cases concerning state officials nabbed for accepting bribes in return for official favours.

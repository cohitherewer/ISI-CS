          SAMYABRATA RAY GOSWAMI                                    
	Mumbai, Aug. 4: Bhupen Hazarika underwent a successful bypass surgery at Mumbais Kolkilaben Dhirubhai Ambani Hospital today and has been put on ventilator.        
	He had a good nights sleep and was wheeled into the operation theatre for surgery at 8am in the morning. The surgery ended at 2.30pm. The doctors have called it a successful surgery, said Hazarikas friend, Col (retd) Manoranjan Goswami, who was at the hospital.        
	Hazarikas companion, film director Kalpana Lajmi, allayed anxiety about the ventilator.         
	There is nothing to worry about the ventilator. It is a normal procedure to put a patient on ventilator post-bypass surgery. He is expected to regain consciousness by around 10am on Wednesday. The doctors will take him off the ventilator after that, said Lajmi.        
	The legendary singer is currently in cubicle number 102 of the ICCU on the third floor of the hospital.        
	He is doing quite well. He was cheerful when he went for the surgery and the sisters at the hospital who tended to him this morning said they were floored by his charm, said a senior nurse at the hospital.        
	Hazarikas biographer Surya Hazarika and old aide Kamal Katoky have been by the maestros side since Monday.        
	Assam chief minister Tarun Gogoi, who is currently visiting Mumbai, was supposed to visit Hazarika today.        
	But he changed his plan this morning after we told him that he would be in ICCU for the next two-three days at least. The chief minister will now visit him on August 8,said Col (retd) Goswami.        
	Gogoi chose to go to the Sai Baba temple at Shirdi near Mumbai with his wife instead.        
	The state government of Assam is bearing the cost of Hazarikas bypass surgery.        
	Hazarika fell ill at his Delhi hotel after returning from the Sangeet Ratna function on July 14.        
	After returning from the event, he started feeling breathless and was very uncomfortable. The hotel doctor passed it off as reflux and gastric disorder. But I did not want to take any chances. So the next day, after landing in Mumbai, I took him directly to Kokilaben Hospital, Lajmi had said yesterday.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                               
	New Delhi, Aug. 3: Indias pandemic influenza patterns turned ugly today with the death of a 14-year-old girl infected with the flu virus, the first signal of community spread in India, and the countrys first cluster in Panchgani town in Maharashtra.         
	The Pune girl who died this evening with symptoms of severe lung infection had developed cold and fever eight days ago and was admitted to a private clinic before fluid from her lungs was sent for flu tests to the National Institute of Virology in the same city.         
	At least 60 schoolchildren have picked up the pandemic H1N1 virus in Pune over the past two weeks, but this girl had no history of foreign travel, nor had she come into obvious contact with any person who was infected.         
	Health officials said tonight that her case indicated that community spread of the virus was occurring in Pune. A two-member disease investigation team from Delhi flew into Pune this evening to determine the source of her infection.         
	Public health experts say community spread is a key milestone in the evolution of a flu pandemic that indicates that the virus is well-entrenched. The focus at this point should shift from preventing its entry to managing it well, one expert said.         
	The number of people in India found infected with H1N1 through laboratory tests has climbed to 558, but almost all patients have displayed mild symptoms  in line with patterns of the infection in most other countries.         
	The virus which has infected more than 130,000 people in 135 countries has killed 816, mostly in North and South America but also in other parts of the world. Scientists from the US Centers for Disease Control had cautioned during the early phase of the pandemic in America that as the numbers of infections burgeon, deaths could be expected to occur.         
	But doctors in India say the death in Pune today has exposed flaws in the Indian governments existing strategy of testing only patients who have come in contact with a previously infected person or those who have a history of foreign travel.         
	The government currently provides the anti-viral drug oseltamivir to patients only through designated-government hospitals.         
	Because of this policy, the girl would have been denied a diagnostic test as well as the anti-viral drug oseltamivir  until it was too late, said a senior doctor at a government hospital who has been urging the health ministry to change its strategy.         
	Medical experts are hoping the death would jolt the government into corrective strategy shifts.         
	Its time the drug was made available to public and private hospitals, but its use should be judicious and made accountable, one expert told The Telegraph. There are guidelines on who should get the drug  vulnerable populations and those who appear to be heading for serious disease.         
	The girl in Pune had developed symptoms of sore throat and cold on July 21, for which she had received treatment from a private practitioner.         
	She developed fever on July 25 and was admitted to a private nursing home. She was placed on a ventilator when the infection affected her lungs , but samples of her lung fluids were sent for testing for flu only on July 31. Although doctors had initiated oseltamivir therapy on July 30, she died this evening.         
	Medical experts say oseltamivir appears to work best when administered early during the serious phase of the infection.         
	Health authorities today said three doctors and a nurse who developed respiratory symptoms at the hospital have been administered oseltamivir as preventive therapy. At least 85 other people, including 11 family members of the girl, have also been given oseltamivir therapy.         
	The countrys first cluster of pandemic flu has also surfaced in the town of Panchgani in Satara district where 90 children in a private school had developed an influenza-like illness and 23 have tested positive for the H1N1 virus.         
	Health officials said they were still investigating the circumstances under which the school was hit by a cluster of cases. Although some students had travelled to the US and the Netherlands during April and May, the earliest cases of flu-like illness in the school only emerged during the first week of July  well beyond the typical gestation period of two to seven days.         
	Community spread and clusters make it harder to detect individual cases. The World Health Organisation had recommended several weeks ago that countries where the flu is spreading in communities should move away from confirming every case to tracking broad trends of the disease in the community.

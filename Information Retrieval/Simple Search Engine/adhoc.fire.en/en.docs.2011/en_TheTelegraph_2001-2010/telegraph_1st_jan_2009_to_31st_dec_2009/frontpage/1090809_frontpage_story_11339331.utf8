          G.S. RADHAKRISHNA AND SATISH NANDGAONKAR                              
	Aug. 8: The poor monsoon has triggered early tragedy in Indias farm suicide belts, with several despairing farmers killing themselves right at the start of the kharif season.        
	Five took their own lives in the past few days in Andhra Pradesh after their seed stocks went waste, either because they couldnt sow them in time owing to scanty rain or because they dried up in the fields.        
	Seven suicides in August and 36 in July have been reported from Maharashtras Vidarbha, where a dry spell has damaged more than half the standing soybean crop.        
	Andhra farmers had taken huge loans to stock fertilisers and seeds and made preparations to expand their area of cultivation by over 20 per cent this year, buoyed by government assurances of a strong monsoon and the good rain of the past five years.        
	With the monsoon season more than halfway through and the nation-wide rain deficit up from 19 to 25 per cent, they have been left high and dry.        
	Mandal Koraiah, 45, of Karimnagar had taken a loan of Rs 50,000 to raise cotton on his 15 acres. He drank pesticide after his seedlings dried up.        
	I wish he had told me; then I too could have joined him, sobbed his wife Lakshmiamma, 40, left with the responsibility of feeding her two teenage children and repaying her husbands debts.        
	Such tragedies mostly occur during harvest time, in October or later, when crop failure drives some farmers to kill themselves, but the scanty rainfall is already filling many with despair this year.        
	Scientists have said the chances of a late monsoon rally making up the rain deficit are decreasing and predicted a drop in yields.         
	 In Vidarbha, Prakash Kotate of Gaigaon and Dadarao Mankar of Akola hanged themselves on Raksha Bandhan day. Ramdas Pawar of Yavatmal swallowed poison and Madan Andale of Amravati jumped into a well.        
	In Andhras Mahboobnagar, groundnut farmer Kavali Raju, 30, took sleeping tablets, leaving his pregnant wife to bear the brunt of his Rs 18,000 loan.        
	 Konda Mogili, 60, of Warangal and Baku Subbi Reddy, 40, of Chittoor had lost their cotton and tomato crops last season and this kharifs disappointment proved the last straw. We were to marry off our daughter Kanakalakshmi in October, said Reddys wife Mahalakshmi.        
	Almost one lakh quintals of seeds have gone waste and seedlings in 10 lakh hectares have dried up, Andhra agriculture minister N. Raghurami Reddy said. Cotton has been sown in 10.26 lakh hectares out of 12 lakh hectares, and groundnut on eight lakh hectares out of 14 lakh hectares.        
	The Andhra government says a 50 per cent rain deficit could lead to a failure of the cotton crop in seven districts and a loss of Rs 325 crore in input costs alone.        
	B. Ramanamma, a woman farmer from Karimnagar, said that even after the monsoon had a patchy start, the farmers had made preparations for intensive cultivation on assurances from officials and politicians that rainfall would improve by the third week of July.        
	Will anyone please tell us how we can carry on till October, when our neighbours will be in a position to lend us grains and alms? she asked.        
	Farmer-friendly chief minister Y.S.R. Reddy  first swept to power in 2004 by a wave of anger against the Chandrababu Naidu government following a spate in farmer suicides  had this to say: Nine years of misrule by Naidu and seven years of drought cannot be set right overnight.        
	Maharashtras Ashok Chavan government, facing an Assembly election in October, has announced measures to tackle the drought-like situation in 129 tehsils.

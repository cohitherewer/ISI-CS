          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Bhubaneswar, April 12: Armed Maoists have laid siege to the explosives depot of Asias largest bauxite mine in Orissa, trapping several employees and triggering a gun battle that stretched beyond midnight.        
	The mine is owned by Nalco and is located in Koraput districts Damanjodi, over 600km from Bhubaneswar.        
	If the huge stocks of explosives kept in the magazine for blasting mines fall into the hands of the Maoists, the threat to elections in the region will increase manifold, police sources said. The Maoists are boycotting the elections.        
	Preliminary reports suggested that at least 12 tonnes of explosives were kept in the facility. An officer expressed the fear that some of the Maoists could already have fled with part of the explosives but there was no confirmation.        
	The number of employees trapped inside the complex is estimated to range between 100 and 200.         
	The Maoists, said to number 200, including 50 women, are being engaged by 22 jawans of the Central Industrial Security Force assigned to protect the facility. Sources said heavy gunfire could be heard till late on Sunday night.        
	Two CISF jawans were feared killed, the sources said, but added that their bodies had not been found till late tonight. Hilly terrain and darkness are impeding the security operation. Telecommunication links have been cut off as the rebels have blown off mobile towers, a senior police officer said in Bhubaneswar.        
	The attack on the magazine (explosives depot) was launched around 9.30pm when the jawans were in the canteen. While the women cadres took position at the gates, the men encircled the mine complex.        
	The Koraput superintendent of police, Dipak Kumar, said the CRPF, Orissa polices Special Operations Group and district voluntary forces were moving towards the spot.        
	The sources said the Maoists were announcing over public address system that landmines had been laid on the route  the warning apparently meant to deter the advancing party of reinforcements.

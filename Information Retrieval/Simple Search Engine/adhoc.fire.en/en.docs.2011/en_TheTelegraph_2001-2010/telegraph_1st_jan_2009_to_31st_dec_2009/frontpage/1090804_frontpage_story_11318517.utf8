The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Double flop in weekday test 
                                                                                                           Double flop in weekday test 
  - Buses fewer than promised, auto crackdown flags          OUR BUREAU                            Commuters pile into a vehicle on shuttle service in Calcutta on Monday. Picture by Sanjoy Chattopadhyaya                                        
	Calcutta, Aug. 3: City commuters were left groaning on the first weekday of the polluting-vehicle ban with the state failing to ply the promised extra buses, just as it failed to convincingly enforce the court-ordered ban.        
	Instead of the pledged 2,200 public buses, barely 1,500 ran. Many were unable to force their way into jam-packed buses or too afraid to try.        
	Seems like were back in the 70s and 80s, said bank employee Subhro Moitro, 52, at Ultadanga, pointing at commuters hanging precariously from bus rods. Ive been waiting here for 35 minutes but there isnt a single auto or bus to take me to Shovabazar Metro station.        
	From Baguiati and Talla to Behala and Tollygunge, the scene was the same.        
	Not that the government did much better on the crackdown front. In the three days since the ban on two-stroke autos and older-than-15 commercial vehicles has come into force, police have seized two autos, eight lorries, three taxies, two buses and one mini-truck from Calcutta and adjoining Howrah and North and South 24-Parganas.        
	Yet two-stroke autos ran with impunity at places like Nagerbazar, not necessarily with acknowledgement slips saying they had applied for LPG conversion  an escape hatch left open by the government. That plan has had a poor start with few applications received so far.        
	The passenger load would be lower tomorrow because most schools will remain closed to mourn Subhas Chakrabortys death, but traffic could get worse as the funeral procession criss-crosses the city. We are making elaborate route diversion plans, a traffic department official said.        
	With the procession keeping them busy, the police are expected to pause the crackdown on banned vehicles. Anyway, from tomorrow, the crackdown teams will work a single shift instead of two, a senior officer said.        
	Bus and minibus operators are looking to tomorrow with hope, waiting for their plea for an extension of the ban deadline to come up in the Supreme Court. Whatever the outcome, we will not hold a strike, said spokesperson Swarnakamal Saha.        
	Auto operators, however, have threatened an intensified agitation unless the government lets all two-stroke autos convert to LPG and ply. The government has set August 2000 as the cutoff date, saying converting older ones would not ease pollution.        
	Our protests will continue till our demands are met, said Shobhandeb Chattopadhyay, leader of the Trinamul-backed Auto Bachao Committee.        
	In parts of the city, two-stroke auto operators attacked green autos and public buses, further hurting the transport system. The Metro too was paralysed from 2.16pm to 3.05pm after a 35-year-old man jumped in front of a train at Kalighat station.        
	Transport secretary Sumantra Chowdhury said the government had invited applications for 400 contract carriages to operate as private buses for 12 weeks. By end-August, he added, 50 new buses from Tata Motors, 40 from Ashok Leyland and 15 from Volvo would hit the streets.

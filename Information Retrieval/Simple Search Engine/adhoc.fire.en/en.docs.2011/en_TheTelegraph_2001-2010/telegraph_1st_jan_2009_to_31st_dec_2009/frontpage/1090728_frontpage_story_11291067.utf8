          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Mumbai, July 27: A middle-aged couple who took along their daughters, aged 16 and 3, on their way to plant a bomb were today convicted in Mumbais Gateway of India-Zaveri Bazaar blasts that killed 54 people in August 2003.        
	Along with Hanif Sayyed, 46, and Fehmida Sayyed, 43  who carried out what was probably the first all-family bombing in India  the court convicted Ashrat Ansari, 32.        
	Guilty of criminal conspiracy, murder and attempt to murder, the three residents of Mumbais Andheri slums face life terms or death when the Pota (anti-terror) court passes the sentences on August 4.        
	The trio, who said the twin blasts were revenge for the 2002 Gujarat riots, listened intently as judge M.R. Puranik pronounced them guilty but showed little emotion.        
	The verdict is not surprising. We have been held guilty by the media and people long before, Hanif said as he hugged Fehmida and elder daughter Farheen, now 22.        
	Our aim was to target areas with a Gujarati majority, said Ansari, a zari worker who had fled Surat after the riots and was driving an auto in Mumbai. He wants to appeal in the high court.        
	A co-conspirator had turned approver and testified in court the plot was hatched in Dubai by the Lashkar-e-Toiba and (some) Pakistanis, prosecutor Ujjwal Nikam said.        
	Police sources said Hanif, originally from Uttar Pradesh, worked as an electrician in Saudi Arabia and then as a forklift driver for Hilton Hotel in Dubai, were he came in touch with Lashkar operative Nasir Ahmed.        
	Hanif arrived in Mumbai in September 2002 and met Ansari on Ahmeds instructions. Ahmed provided them with RDX and gelatin sticks.        
	On August 25, 2003, the Sayyed couple climbed into a taxi with daughters Farheen and Shakira and a bomb that they placed in the boot. Reaching the Gateway around 1pm, they got off for lunch. The taxi driver, who stepped out for a stroll, watched his car blow up minutes later.        
	Around the same time, Ansari and Ahmed reached Zaveri Bazaar, a commodity markets hub, in another cab to trigger the other blast. The Sayyeds returned home by bus and Fehmida watched the TV coverage of the explosions together with neighbours.        
	Seven people were arrested, including Farheen who was later discharged with the approver and two others. Ahmed died in an encounter in September 2003.        
	The Sayyeds and Ansari are suspects in two other cases  the July 28, 2003, explosion in a bus at Mumbais Ghatkopar that killed two persons, and the planting of a bomb, which failed to explode, in a bus on December 2, 2002. These were among seven post-riot terror strikes in Mumbai.

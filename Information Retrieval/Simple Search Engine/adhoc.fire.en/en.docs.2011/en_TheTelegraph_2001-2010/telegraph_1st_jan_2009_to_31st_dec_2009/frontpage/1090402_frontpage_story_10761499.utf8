          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                            Writers Buildings empty picture gallery after the photographs of the chief minister and his colleagues were removed on Wednesday following a directive from the Election Commission. The panel, however, allowed the government to retain the pictures of national heroes who are not present-day politicians. Telegraph pictures                                   
	Calcutta, April 1: Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee should be happy that Rabindranath Tagore stays at Writers Buildings, thanks to a revised directive from the Election Commission. But perhaps Writers walls show what has changed, and what has not, in Bengals hero worship.        
	Picture this: Only three of Bhattacharjees ministerial colleagues have pictures of either Marx, Lenin or Engels on the walls of their rooms at Writers. The chief minister has none, choosing instead to have two portraits of Tagore on the walls of his two guestrooms adjoining his chamber.         
	The stark difference from the days of the United Front governments (in 1967 and 1969, made of mostly Left parties and a Congress breakaway formation) and the early days of the Left Front government is difficult to miss, when most of the ministers had pictures of Marx, Engels and Lenin up on their walls.         
	We can recall the portraits of Marx and Lenin in the late CPM leader and minister Benoy Chowdhurys chamber at Writers. The late RSP leader and PWD minister Matish Roy also had pictures of Marx and Engels on the walls of his Writers Buildings chamber, said PWD minister Kshiti Goswami, from the walls of whose room the picture of Marx has disappeared over the years.        
	The chief minister, of course, has never hesitated to display his admiration for Tagore.        
	It was during Bhattacharjees stint as information and cultural affairs minister  a portfolio he still holds  that Tagores Balmiki Pratibha portrait made an entry into Writers Buildings in 1993 which is now displayed on the walls of the corridor.         
	Buddhababu loves to deal with the cultural world and has the highest respect for Rabindranath. He took the initiative to put up the huge Tagore picture in the Writers Buildings corridor after talking to the then chief minister Jyoti Basu. I remember him saying at that time that there would be a sense of void in Writers without Tagores picture, recalled an old-timer in the government.                     
	It is because of Buddhababus weakness for Tagore that he had fumed at yesterdays Election Commission directive, social welfare minister Biswanath Chowdhury said today.         
	Bhattacharjee may have been peeved at the Election Commissions earlier fiat that only pictures of Mahatma Gandhi, the incumbent President and the governor could be displayed in government offices.        
	But a picture of Shakespeare does not adorn the walls of 10 Downing Street. Nor does Hemingway or Faulkner have any presence in the White House.        
	Jyoti Basu never had a fancy for photographs -- either from the Left or from the world of culture. But, according to an old-timer in Basus secretariat, the CPM patriarch would never miss out on an opportunity to talk about mahamoti (profound) Lenin.        
	Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose made his entry into the hallowed portals of Writers Buildings much later, in fact a little over a year ago.         
	During Siddhartha Rays regime, there were pictures of C.R. Das and Benoy-Badal-Dinesh in the Writers corridor, but Netaji was somehow missing, an official of the chief ministers secretariat said. It was at Buddhababus insistence that a photograph of Netaji was put up on the walls of Writers.         
	So are the Marxists falling out of love with the Marx-Engels-Lenin trio?        
	Can anybody think of being in a communist party without following Lenin? That would be going backwards. I am proud to have his picture, CPI minister Nandagopal Bhattacharyya asked in indignation. His picture dazzles in my room.        
	So is the case with his party colleague and minister Srikumar Mukherjee.        
	And among the ministers from the CPM? Lenin would still find an old faithful in industries minister Nirupam Sen. A picture of the revolutionary leader still hangs from the walls of his room.        
	As for the other portraits and photographs, Writers Buildings went into an overdrive today, removing from its walls framed images of the chief minister and other ministers inaugurating events and attending ceremonies.        
	But the photographs of all other national heroes continued to adorn its walls after the chief electoral officer clarified this morning that the election commissioner didnt want to disrespect national heroes and their photos can stay. So only pictures of present-day politicians and ministers would not be allowed in government offices.

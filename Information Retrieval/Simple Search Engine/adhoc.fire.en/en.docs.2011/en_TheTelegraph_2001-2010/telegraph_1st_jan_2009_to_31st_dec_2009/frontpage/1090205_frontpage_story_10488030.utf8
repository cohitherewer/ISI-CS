          OUR BUREAU                               
	Kohima/Imphal, Feb. 4: Armed with the licence to go hard after militants, Nagaland and Manipur got down to business today, a day after Union home minister P. Chidambaram said violence would not be tolerated by any means.         
	In Nagaland, the Assam Rifles dismantled six huts of the NSCN (Isak-Muivah) at Bade village near Camp Hebron, the council headquarters of the outfit, while Manipur chief minister Okram Ibobi Singh said his government would not tolerate any demand for sovereignty.         
	Sources said the Assam Rifles personnel, loaded in three Gypsies and three trucks, swooped down on the cluster of huts that housed the road opening party (ROP) of the Naga army, the military wing of the NSCN (I-M). The cadres comprising the road opening party are deployed along a road to ensure that no one can lay ambush to the outfits vehicles that pass by.         
	The Assam Rifles said it razed the ROP camps because they were not approved by the government and would dismantle other such camps in the state as well.         
	The paramilitary troops took away all the belongings of the NSCN (I-M) cadres, but not the arms. It assured the outfit that it would return the belongings at the earliest.         
	The NSCN (I-M), however, took strong exception to the action and accused the Assam Rifles of violating ground rules. It also claimed that the ROP camps were notified.         
	An NSCN source said the group had been trying to avoid any confrontation with the security forces, but they are testing our patience. The outfit said it should not be held responsible for any fallout of the action by Assam Rifles.         
	In Manipur, chief minister Okram Ibobi Singh today reiterated that India was a sovereign country and Manipur a part of it. He warned that the government would go after militants who refused to come to the negotiating table.         
	The government will not tolerate any group demanding sovereignty. We will evict rebel camps not authorised by the government, he told reporters while inspecting the construction of the Jawaharlal Nehru Institute of Medical Sciences in Imphal East today.         
	Sources said Chidambaram had asked Ibobi Singh to come down heavily on militants and extortionists and to be prepared for massive flush-out operations after Lok Sabha elections.         
	Official sources said Ibobi Singhs tough talk today was an indication that he was prepared to take firmer and stronger measures to force militant groups to come to the negotiating table.         
	In his first public reaction to the Siroy stand-off between the Assam Rifles and the NSCN (I-M) cadres, Ibobi Singh said Manipur was not a party to the peace talks with the outfit so there could not be any government-approved camp of the group in Manipur.

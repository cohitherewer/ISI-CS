  - Mamata upset after claim that officials wont venture out           OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      Members of the central team during a meeting at Writers rsquo; on Tuesday. (Sanjoy Chattopadhyaya)                                
	Calcutta, Dec. 1: The central team now in Calcutta has no plans to leave the city to visit the states trouble spots, the Bengal government said today, leaving Mamata Banerjee very upset.        
	The team is likely to discuss Bengals law and order sitting in Calcutta where they will meet the administrations of nine districts tomorrow before catching a 5pm flight back to Delhi, state chief secretary Asok Mohan Chakrabarti said.        
	The claim could not be confirmed with the four-member team, led by Union home ministry additional secretary Dipranjan Sarathi Chowdhury.        
	Mamata is very upset, Trinamul sources said.        
	She has directed me to meet the team tomorrow and ask them to visit Khanakul (in Hooghly), central minister Mukul Roy said. She had specifically requested home minister P. Chidambaram to send a team to Khanakul where our party workers are being killed.        
	Earlier, Chakrabarti had said after a meeting with the team at Writers Buildings: The central team has come to discuss law and order. Their intention is to help us maintain normality. However, I wasnt told by the team leader that they would visit any troubled area. Till this evening, they had no such programme. I dont think they have any such plan.        
	Trinamuls official reaction seemed to betray a sense of perplexity.        
	Whenever a central team visits any state to assess law and order, it is expected to look into all the details. Talking to the government, political parties and the public at large is necessary, party secretary-general Partha Chatterjee said.        
	We shall have to wait for the report the team submits to the home ministry. We prefer to wait and watch.        
	Trinamul staged a drama of sorts by sending MP Kalyan Banerjee to a city club where the central team and senior state officials were lunching before a second round of talks at Writers.        
	Banerjee walked up to the team leader and said his party would hand him a memorandum tomorrow at the BSF guesthouse where the team is staying, and not at Writers.        
	I saw them having lunch with the home secretary and other officials. I asked the team leader how he could have lunch with officials of a killer government, the MP said.        
	The Left Front handed the central team a memorandum at Writers with an audio-visual CD containing evidence of an alleged Maoist-Trinamul nexus. A front leader said RSP minister Kshiti Goswami had asked the central officials if they planned to visit the violence-hit areas.         
	But the leader of the team said they would not visit any place because of time constraints and would leave tomorrow, the front leader said.        
	The chief secretary said the central team would meet the district magistrates (DMs) and superintendents of police (SPs) of Hooghly, East Midnapore, West Midnapore, North 24-Parganas, South 24-Parganas, Burdwan, Birbhum, Jalpaiguri and Darjeeling.        
	The idea is to offer inputs on what has been happening in these nine districts where some trouble or the other had erupted before or after the Lok Sabha elections, Chakrabarti said. The home secretary and director-general of police will attend tomorrows meeting.        
	He said the days discussions included the Hooghly killings, Maoist violence, Darjeeling unrest and the Adivasi-Gorkha clashes in the Dooars.        
	A source said the state government had told the Delhi team Bengal needed more central forces. The team may submit a report recommending additional forces for troubled areas. The state, however, doesnt plan to send a written report to the Union home ministry, the source added.        
	The front gave the team photocopies of media reports and the CD, which allegedly shows Mamata at a Lalgarh rally with Chhatradhar Mahato, leader of the Peoples Committee Against Police Atrocities who has been booked under the Unlawful Activities Prevention Act for suspected Maoist links.        
	The CD also purports to show Trinamul MP Subhendu Adhikaris speech at a Nandigram rally where Maoist squad leaders Narayan and Sukumar were allegedly present.

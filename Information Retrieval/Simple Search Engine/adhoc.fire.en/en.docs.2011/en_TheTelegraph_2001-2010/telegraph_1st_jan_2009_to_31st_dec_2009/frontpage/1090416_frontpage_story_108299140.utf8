The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Poll in Maoist sights, IAF sends choppers 
                                                                                                           Off the blocks
										      
	THE FIRST ROUND  
	 The first phase of voting gets off the ground on Thursday. Polling will be held in 124 seats spread across 14 states   and three Union territories  
	THE STATES  
	 Andhra: 22 out of 42, Kerala 20 (all), UP 16 (80),   Bihar 13 (40), Maharashtra 13 (48), Chhattisgarh 11 (all), Orissa 10 (21), Jharkhand 6 (14) Assam 3 (14),   Arunachal 2 (all), Meghalaya 2 (all), Manipur 1 (2),   J amp;K 1 (6), Mizoram 1 (all) and Nagaland 1 (all)  
	BIG CHUNKS  
	Andhra: The single largest segment going to the polls today (22 out of 42 seats). The 22 are spread across   14 districts (10 in the Telengana region demanding a separate state and four in the north coastal region).  
	 In 2004, the Congress had secured 13 of the 22. The Telengana Rashtra Samiti and the Left parties, which later supported the UPA government, bagged seven. The Telugu Desam and the Majlis-e-Ittehadul   Muslimeen were left   with one each.   
	This time, the ldquo;grand   alliance rdquo; of the Desam, TRS and the Left appears to have consolidated the votes. But much will depend on the new kid on the block,   Chiranjeevi rsquo;s Praja Rajyam, which could eat into the Congress rsquo; share in   Telengana and impact the Desam in the coastal areas   
	 Kerala: Congress-led UPA hoping to make big gains.   Its assessment: 15 out of 
  20, instead of 1 last time.   But Left says it will clock   a ldquo;decent show rdquo;  
	 UP: Samajwadi swept 13   of the 16 last time. BSP looks the strongest now.   BJP appears to be making   a strong comeback  
	 Bihar: Of the 13 voting today, Lalu Prasad rsquo;s RJD won eight. But Nitish Kumar is on a strong wicket in the state now  
	 Maharashtra: In 2004,   the NDA won 11 of the 13 seats in the Vidarbha and Marathwada regions. This time, the Congress feels   it is an even battle  
	 Chhattisgarh: The ruling BJP holds 10 of the 11 seats. The Congress is banking on the theory that the rival will find it difficult   to repeat the near-sweep  
	BIG ONES  
	 lsquo;Star rsquo; candidates whose fate will be decided today: Shashi Tharoor, Lalu Prasad, Renuka Chowdhury,  Yashwant Sinha, K. Chandrashekhar Rao,   Vijayashanti, NTR rsquo;s daughter D. Purandeswari   
	ASSEMBLY POLLS  
	 Assembly elections in   some seats in Andhra Pradesh and Orissa will also be held simultaneously on Thursday. Elections will be held in 154 out of 294   Assembly constituencies   in Andhra and 70 of 147   in Orissa  
	CROREPATI  
	 At least 193 crorepatis are contesting in the first phase, according to the Association of Democratic Rights

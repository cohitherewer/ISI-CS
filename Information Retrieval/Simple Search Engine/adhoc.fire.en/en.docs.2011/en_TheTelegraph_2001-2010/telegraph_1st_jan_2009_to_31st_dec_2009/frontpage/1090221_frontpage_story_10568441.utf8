                                                                                                           Security loss for Clooney
                                Clooney: Peace price                            
	United Nations, Feb. 20 (Reuters): The UN said today it was looking into a media allegation it had withdrawn a security escort for actor George Clooney, a UN messenger of peace, as he visited a lawless area of Chad.        
	UN spokeswoman Michele Montas cast doubt on the report, saying the UN mission in the West African country had no armed military police and relied on others for armed escorts. In a column published yesterday, New York Times journalist Nicholas Kristof, who is travelling with Clooney, linked the alleged UN move with nervousness in the region over a possible indictment of President Omar Hassan al-Bashir of Sudan.

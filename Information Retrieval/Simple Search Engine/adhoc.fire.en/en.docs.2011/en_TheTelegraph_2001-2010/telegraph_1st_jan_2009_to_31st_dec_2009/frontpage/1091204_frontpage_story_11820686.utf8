	New Delhi, Dec. 3: A top US commander is in New Delhi to seek Indian military help to train Afghanistans army even as the import of Barack Obamas 18-month surge-and-exit strategy for the embattled country is being assessed.        
	The commander of the US Pacific Command, Admiral Robert F. Willard, met senior officers in the capital today and enquired if Indian special forces instructors could be deployed in select Afghan National Army (ANA) academies to train troops in commando operations.        
	We have not said yes or no. We are assessing and we will take everything into consideration, a defence ministry official told The Telegraph. This is not quite the same as deploying troops. So we shall see. We do have good relations with the Afghan military.        
	Admiral Willard met the chairman, chiefs of staff committee, and army chief, General Deepak Kapoor; the chief of naval staff, Admiral Nirmal Verma; the vice-chief of air staff, Air Marshal P.K. Barbora; and the defence secretary, Praveen Kumar. He was hosted by the chief of the integrated defence staff, Air Marshal Suresh Chand Mukul.        
	In international coalition efforts to stabilise Afghanistan, the US is the lead nation  denoting that it has primary responsibility  for the Afghan National Army. The surge-and-exit strategy, which involves deployment of 30,000 additional US troops plus anticipated (but much less) troop contributions from Nato countries, has a roadmap for the expansion of the ANA built into it.        
	In July, the chief of the ANA, General Bismillah Khan Mohammadi, was hosted in New Delhi. India says its involvement in Afghanistan is restricted to humanitarian projects. Deploying Indian military instructors in Afghanistan under US aegis will give Delhi a larger strategic footprint in Kabul at the cost of upsetting Pakistan.        
	Between 50 and 100 Afghan officers and soldiers are trained in Indian military institutions, such as the National Defence Academy and the Indian Military Academy, every year. India runs a medical mission in Kabul that is manned by army doctors.        
	It also trains Afghan soldiers in India to play martial music and has sent a team to teach Afghan army officers to read, write and speak in English so that they may communicate better with the Americans. Indian military efforts in Afghanistan since 2001 have included the supply of 300 troop carriers (trucks) and consignments of bullet-proof jackets and helmets.        
	But deploying Indian soldiers in Afghanistan, even if for the specific purpose of training, is more serious than lessons in music and tuitions in English.         
	First, it puts Indian soldiers at risk in a foreign country. Indian telecom engineers have been kidnapped and killed and the Indian Embassy in Kabul has been bombed twice. It also means that Pakistan, suspicious about Indian consulates in Jalalabad, Herat and Kandahar, may object.         
	The Karzai government has welcomed international efforts to train its army. After Obamas strategy was announced yesterday, Afghan defence minister General Abdul Rahim Wardak said: We just ask the international community to equip us quickly, to train us quickly, so that we can fulfil our historic responsibility.

          BROOKS BARNES                            Epic makeover                                  
	Los Angeles, Nov. 5: For decades, the Walt Disney Company has largely kept Mickey Mouse frozen under glass, fearful that even the tiniest tinkering might tarnish the brand and upend his $5 billion or so in annual merchandise sales.         
	One false move and Disney could have on its hands a New Coke, Coca-Colas 1985 variant that was rejected by drinkers who didnt like its flavour and preferred rival Pepsis sweeter fare.        
	Now, concerned that Mickey has become more of a corporate symbol than a beloved character for recent generations of young people, Disney is taking the risky step of re-imagining him for the future.        
	The first glimmer of this will be the introduction next year of a new video game, Epic Mickey, in which the formerly squeaky clean character can be cantankerous and cunning, as well as heroic, as he traverses a forbidding wasteland.        
	And at the same time, in a parallel but separate effort, Disney has quietly embarked on an even larger project to rethink the characters personality, from the way Mickey walks and talks to the way he appears on the Disney Channel and how children interact with him on the Web  even what his house looks like at Disney World.        
	Holy cow, the opportunity to mess with one of the most recognisable icons on Planet Earth, said Warren Spector, the creative director of Junction Point, a Disney-owned game developer that spearheaded Epic Mickey.        
	The effort to re-engineer Mickey is still in its early stages, but it involves the top creative and marketing minds in the company, all the way up to Robert A. Iger, Disneys chief executive.        
	The project was given new impetus this week with the announcement that, after 20 years of negotiations, the company has finally received the blessing of the Chinese government to open a theme park in Shanghai, potentially unlocking a new giant market for all things Mickey.        
	Disney executives are treading carefully, and trying to keep a low profile, as they discuss how much they dare tweak one of the most durable characters in pop culture history to induce new generations of texting, tech-savvy children to embrace him.         
	Disney executives will keenly watch how Epic Mickey is received, to inform the broader overhaul.        
	Keeping cartoon characters trapped in amber is one of the surest routes to irrelevancy. While Mickey remains a superstar in many homes, particularly overseas, his static nature has resulted in a generation of Americans  the one that grew up with Nickelodeon and Pixar  that knows him, but may not love him.         
	Domestic sales in particular have declined: of his $5 billion in merchandise sales in 2009, less than 20 per cent will come from the US.        
	Theres a distinct risk of alienating your core consumer when you tweak a sacred character, but at this point its a risk they have to take, said Matt Britton, the managing partner of Mr Youth, a New York brand consultant firm.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                              
	Mumbai, Oct. 8: Maoists today killed 17 policemen in a forest on the Maharashtra border that offers shelter to fugitives from other states, the massacre coinciding with a central flurry to launch an offensive against the extremists.        
	A group of 150 Maoists ambushed the police patrol this afternoon in a forested area at Bhamragad in Gadchiroli near the Maharashtra-Chhattisgarh border.        
	Gadchiroli, where arrested Maoist leader Khobad Ghandy plunged into activism in the 1970s, is located around the confluence of three rivers and is considered a safe haven for guerrillas on the run from Chhattisgarh and Andhra Pradesh.        
	The Centre has been fearing a spurt in attacks in areas such as Gadchiroli as the guerrillas are expected to disperse from known areas of concentration and spread out ahead of the expected offensive. Besides, Maharashtra goes to the polls on Tuesday.        
	The Union government today signalled that central and state police forces and the air force would go into mission-specific operations.        
	The police party, led by sub-inspector Chandrashekhar Deshmukh, was patrolling a semi-hilly stretch about 4km from their police station when they came under fire. The encounter went on for around three hours.        
	Reinforcements were sent soon but two BSF platoons could not advance fast because the Maoists had blocked the route with felled trees  an indication that the ambush was planned in detail. The troops eventually reached the spot on foot.        
	The BSF engaged some Maoists in gun battle and managed to rescue 20 policemen. The bodies of all 17 slain policemen have been found.        
	The attack came hours after an arson attack on a panchayat office in another part of Gadchiroli, following which a suspected police informer was found beheaded at the site.         
	The ambush unfolded soon after the Maoists rejected home minister P. Chidambarams appeal to abjure violence and an ultimatum to otherwise face the security forces which would engage and confront the rebels.

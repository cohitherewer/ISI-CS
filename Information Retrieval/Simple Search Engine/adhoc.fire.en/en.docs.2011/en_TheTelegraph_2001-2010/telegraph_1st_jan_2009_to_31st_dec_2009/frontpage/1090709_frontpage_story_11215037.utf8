   India voices climate dissent          SANKARSHAN THAKUR                             Gursharan Kaur (third from left), wife of Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, and the wives of other G8 leaders with Pope Benedict XVI (extreme right) at the Vatican on Wednesday. (AP)                                        
	LAquila (Italy), July 8: Prime Minister Manmohan Singh today stepped in to articulate the developing worlds concerns on climate change and the global financial crisis after Chinese President Hu Jintao left the G8/G5 summit abruptly to tackle a domestic crisis.        
	As responsible members of the international community, we recognise our obligation to preserve environment. But climate change cannot be addressed by perpetuating the poverty of developing countries, Singh said. This is a sharp retort to the developed nations goading to the developing countries on their compliance requirements.        
	Speaking after a meeting of G5 leaders (China, Brazil, Mexico, South Africa and India) at LAquila, Singh also foregrounded the concerns of the developing world arising out of the economic downturn.        
	The developing countries have been worst affected by the weakened global economy.... We will stress tomorrow the importance of maintaining adequate flow of finance to the developing countries and also of keeping markets open by resisting protectionist measures, the Prime Minister said.         
	The G5 leaders are scheduled to hold summit sessions with G8 leaders beginning tomorrow. There are apprehensions, some of them playing out already in the West, that the downturn will be used as a shield to raise more protectionist barriers.        
	At a joint media conference, the G5 leaders strongly echoed the views of Singh on both climate change and protectionism.         
	In an evocative message to the West, Brazils President Luiz Incio Lula da Silva said: We know who is liable for more pollution. The rich countries must agree to contain greenhouse gas emissions. We, developing nations, do not want to be treated as second class citizens of the world. We, too, want to go to the top floor.        
	A G8-backed proposal to halve greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 is believed to have been opposed by China and India; the move implies huge emission cuts by the developing nations which claim that halving emissions would impede their industrial and economic growth.                        Singh in L rsquo;Aqila, Hu. (PTI)      
	The developing world, vanguarded by India and China, has been arguing that the rich nations must first set and achieve far higher emission reduction targets and afford the developing world newer renewable energy technologies.        
	Reuters said a draft document by 17 major economies, including India, dropped any reference to halving target and aimed instead for agreement on the need to limit the average increase in global temperature to 2C since pre-industrial times.        
	The developed and developing nations are running against time on agreeing to new operational regimes on environment  the Copenhagen Conference on climate change is scheduled for December  and both sides were looking to the LAquila summit to provide some signal, if not determine the direction in which negotiations are headed.        
	But Chinas Hu has flown off without so much as a goodbye, creating an early flutter and clouding hopes of substantive discussions on climate change and the downturn.         
	Hus departure home has become the latest of many fringe irritants that have cannoned attention off the lofty, and prickly, agendas on the G8/G-5 table.         
	Host Silvio Berlusconi trails flaming personal scandal wherever he goes, his formidable guests must remain shuddered by the prospect of after-tremors to the killer LAquila quake of April  so much so that Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi has decided to pitch a tent as camp residence  and wildcat picketers have struck somewhere or the other protesting everything from globalisation to Berlusconis after hours lifestyle.        
	The Chinese have left behind their special envoy, Dai Bingguao, who is also their chief interlocutor with India on the boundary dispute.        
	Hus departure is being ascribed to bloody and sustained violence between Han Chinese and Uighur Muslim minority groups in the troubled Xinjiang province.         
	Sources in the Indian delegation described Hus departure as an extremely significant one their indication, clearly, was to the possibility of an unparalleled escalation of civic unrest in the northwestern Chinese region.        
	China-watchers say domestic matters are usually handled by Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao. So it must have taken an alarming deterioration for Hu to leave such a summit of world leaders.

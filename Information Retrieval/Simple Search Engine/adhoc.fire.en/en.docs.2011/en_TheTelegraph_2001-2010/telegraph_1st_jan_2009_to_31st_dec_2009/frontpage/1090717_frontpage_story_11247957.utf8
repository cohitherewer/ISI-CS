                                Cambridge University: 800 years and counting                            
	London, July 16 (PTI): Beer drinkers in Cambridge have been invited to toast the universitys 800th anniversary with a brand new ale brewed specially for the occasion.        
	The beer, known as 1209 after the year of the universitys foundation, is based on the type of medieval brew that would have been available to scholars when they arrived in Cambridge 800 years ago. It is described as a traditional recipe that has been updated for modern palates, according to its creator John Bexon, who is the head brewer of Greene King brewery. He describes the beers taste as slightly bitter, with a distinct malty flavour.        
	The beer has been sent to popular pubs in Cambridge, including the Eagle, the Champion of the Thames, the Fort, St George and the Green Dragon. Greene King, based in Bury St Edmunds, has been in existence for over 200 years.        
	Beer is the worlds oldest alcoholic beverage, dating back to ancient Egypt and Mesopotamia. It is unclear exactly when beer made its debut in the UK, although it is likely to have been drunk by the Celtic druid populations who pre-dated the Romans.         
	By the time of Cambridges foundation in 1209, beer was the most popular drink in Britain, and was even enjoyed at breakfast. Beer was often much safer to drink than water, which frequently carried germs and disease.         
	Bexon said that he was honoured to be asked to produce a brew for the universitys 800th anniversary. He said: It is a privilege and a pleasure to have been asked to apply our knowledge and craft for the production of a Cambridge University brew. I hope the residents of Cambridge will be joining students, alumni and university staff in raising a pint to this amazing institution.

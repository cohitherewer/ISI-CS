  - State budget tabled in Parliament          SUMAN K. SHRIVASTAVA                                    
	Ranchi, July 8: Union minister of state for finance Namo Narayan Meena today presented the annual budget for Jharkhand in the Lok Sabha with a thrust on rural development, energy and social welfare, but without proposing any new taxes.        
	The fiscal deficit, however, had zoomed to Rs 2,459.30 crore, approximately 2.97 per cent of gross state domestic product (GSDP). Last year, it was pegged at Rs 908 crore.        
	The budget for Jharkhand, now under Presidents rule  its six-month tenure was extended recently  was prepared by the state finance department under the aegis of G.Krishnan, the adviser to Governor Syed Sibtey Razi, handling finance.        
	Pegged at Rs 22,992.36 crore against last years Rs 18,989.72 crore, the budget did not announce any mega project for the state. It included a plan outlay (funds for development schemes) of Rs 9,555.55 crore, which is an increase of Rs 185 crore from the plan of 2008-09.        
	The remaining Rs 13,436.81 crore was meant for non-plan head (salary payments) which had shot up mainly due to the implementation of the Sixth Pay Commission report.                                
	Jharkhand has been under the Presidents rule since January 19 following a political crisis after chief minister Shibu Soren lost the Tamar by-election that would have made him a member of the state Assembly.         
	While the six-month term of the Presidents rule was recently extended, the Assembly has been kept under suspended animation. Hence, it was mandatory to table the budget in Parliament and have it approved by both Houses.        
	The Lok Sabha will debate the budget on July 13 while the Rajya Sabha will take it up on July 14. Jharkhand was able to keep revenue surplus and fiscal deficit within the prescribed limit of the Jharkhand Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management (FRBM) Act, 2007, in spite of the implementation of the Sixth Pay Commission report, said state finance secretary Rajbala Verma.        
	The focus, he added, was clearly on social sectors  25 per cent more allocation has been announced for welfare and social welfare sectors, while the allocation for education has been hiked by 23 per cent compared to last year.         
	Both rural development and energy got increased allocations: 32 per cent and 40 per cent more, respectively, compared to last year. There was a quantum jump of 190.48 per cent to ensure food security. The allocation for food and civil supply is Rs 305 crore as against Rs 105 crore last year.        
	The budget also approved Rs 3,103.10 crore for labour wages under NREGS against last years Rs 2610. 46 crore.

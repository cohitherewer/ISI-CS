          PETER ALLEN                            Bruni: Festive gesture                                      
	Paris, Dec. 30: Carla Bruni-Sarkozy has been credited with winning the controversial release of two convicted drug traffickers from a prison in the Dominican Republic        
	The French First Lady asked the government of the Caribbean country for a Christmas pardon for Celine Faye, 20, and Sarah Zaknoun, 19, who were caught with 6kg of cocaine in their luggage.        
	Its thanks to her that we are here, said Faye, referring to Bruni-Sarkozy soon after being released from her cell yesterday after serving just 18 months of an eight year sentence.        
	Faye and Zaknoun, who are both French, were caught trying to smuggle the drugs, which had a street value of around 150,000, onto a flight from the Dominican Republic to Paris in June 2008.        
	Both insisted that a mystery third party had planted the cocaine in their luggage without them knowing, prompting Bruni-Sarkozy to take up their case.        
	She is said to have read a number of letters from them, and taken the matter up with the Dominican Republics government, before President Leonel Fernandez freed them.        
	President Nicolas Sarkozy said it was a humanitarian gesture saying the womens one week holiday in the Domincan Republic had turned their lives into a nightmare.        
	He made it clear that they will not face further charges after they returned to France today.        
	But, despite the apparent diplomatic coup, French development minister Alain Joyandet suggested that the womens guilt was not in doubt.        
	Soon after greeting them, Joyanet said: This nice Christmas tale must not make us forget that drug traffickers continue to destroy lives and abuse the anxiety of our youngsters.

	Patna, Jul 15 (PTI): Nearly 10,000 lawyers of the Patna High Court today went on a day's strike to protest the recent killing of an advocate in a bomb blast in the Ara civil court premises last week.  
	 The strike was called by the coordination committee of all three associations of lawyers of the High Court--Bar Association, Lawyers Association and Advocates Association--following an extraordinary meeting on Monday.

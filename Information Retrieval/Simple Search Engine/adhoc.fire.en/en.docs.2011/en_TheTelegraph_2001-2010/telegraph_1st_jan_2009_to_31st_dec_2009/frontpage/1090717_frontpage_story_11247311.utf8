                                                                                                           Gadget supplier to be grilled in Ranchi
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Ranchi, July 16: New Delhi businessman Praveen Sharma, nabbed by Delhi police earlier this week for supplying latest communication gadgets to Maoists in Jharkhand, will be brought to the capital tomorrow for interrogation.        
	Senior superintendent of police Praveen Kumar Singh told The Telegraph that they had received a transit remand from New Delhis Tees Hazari court to bring Sharma to Ranchi.        
	He hoped that Sharmas interrogation would reveal the level of technological expertise of rebels in the state and in return help the police prepare counter-defensive or offensive measures.         
	We will try to find out the exact number of consignments that reached Jharkhand and its neighbouring states from Delhi in the recent past. We will also try to get word on the suppliers plan for the future, said Singh. The supplier will be grilled for the next three days.        
	Sharma was nabbed by New Delhi police on July 14 after Ranchi police tipped off their Delhi counterpart about a consignment of communication gadgets such as walkie-talkie sets, cellphones, transistors and compact antennae reaching Ranchi via an Indian Airlines flight.        
	The consignment was supposed to reach one Naresh Sharma, an employee of Shekhar Construction, supposed to execute road and irrigation projects worth Rs 50 crore and more in Palamau. He, in turn, was to deliver the communication devices to the rebels as levy. In exchange, they would allow the firm to continue work in the area.        
	Praveen Sharma owns a shop in Palika Bazaar of New Delhi. Ranchi police believe that the businessmans interrogation would spring surprises. They will also look into the manner in which arms consignment are being allowed to cross highly strict airport checks.         
	On July 15, Naresh Sharma reportedly confessed that his firm paid over Rs 50 lakh to rebel leader, Sandeepji, whose men torched construction equipment and kidnapped company staff during the initial phase of the project.        
	On July 14, about 60 mobile handsets, 60 wireless radio sets, 60 chargers, 54 battery sets, 10 transistors, two world band receivers, six micro cassette recorders, compact antennae and some bulletproof jackets were seized.        
	The largest haul of wireless gadgets in recent times from the cargo office of an airline in the capital set off alarm bells in security circles. Senior police officers yesterday said they were trying to locate the origin of the consignment and would request the Centre to crack down on illegal markets of sophisticated communication devices flourishing in several big cities, particularly Delhi.

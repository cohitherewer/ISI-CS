The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Cong, Mamatas greedy friend 
                                                                                                           Cong, Mamatas greedy friend 
          OUR BUREAU       
	Oct. 4: Mamata Banerjee without naming the Congress today alleged that my friends were greedy for power in Siliguri even it meant taking the Left support and blamed the partys national leadership for it.         
	I came here to apologise to the people of Siliguri as they gave us a favourable mandate to run the civic board. But we could not live up to that because of our friends betrayal. Aamar bandhura lobhi hoye giyehilo. (My friends had become greedy), the Trinamul Congress chief said with folded hands, while addressing a rally at Bagha Jatin Park in Siliguri town.         
	All 15 Trinamul councillors also stood with folded hands with her on the dais. On Thursday, an election became evident as the Congress and its ally Trinamul refused to give up their demands for the mayors post. The Congress won as all the 17 Left councillor voted in its favour.         
	Mamata today repeated what she had said in Delhi that the decision to form the civic board with Left support was taken at the national level and not at the local level.        
	 It (the decision) is not local, but national and global as well. From local comes the national and global, she said, indicating that both PCC president Pranab Mukherjee and AICC general secretary K.Keshava Rao, in charge of Bengal affairs, had given the go-ahead to the Left support.        
	Mamatas allegation comes closely after Raiganj MP Deepa Das Munshi, who was associated with the Siliguri elections from the very beginning, admitted having spoken to both Mukherjee and Rao before writing to the Left for support.        
	Worried by Mamatas allegations, state Congress leaders today contacted Rao in Delhi to immediately talk to her to clear her misgivings.         
	Mamata was given to understand that our national leaders had instructed Siliguri councillors to seek Left support. But this is not true since the matter was left entirely to the local councillors. We have requested Rao to take up the matter with the Trinamul chief as we will have to keep the alliance intact and take it forward to 2011 Assembly elections, PCC working president Pradip Bhattacharya said.        
	He added that the Siligui mayor had been asked to write to Trinamul councillors requesting them not to sit in the Opposition. We want Trinamul councillors to co-operate with us forgetting the sordid past.        
	During her 25-minute speech, Mamata alleged that the CPM had hatched a deep-rooted conspiracy to stop me from bringing about a change in Bengal.         
	Highlighting her plans for development of railway infrastructure in the region, Mamata said she would extend services to every corner of the region.        
	With Mamatas arrival in Siliguri, there was a rumour that Jalpaiguri Congress MLA Debprasad Roy would join Trinamul. Roy had resigned as PCC vice-president on Friday, alleging that he had not been consulted although he was part of the committee formed to oversee the Siliguri civic polls.         
	The rumour gained momentum when Roy was seen talking to Mamata at the railway function in New Jalpaiguri and described her as our leader, Bengals leader, and a national leader. Asked if he would join Trinamul, Roy said: I am a Congress man and will continue to be so.

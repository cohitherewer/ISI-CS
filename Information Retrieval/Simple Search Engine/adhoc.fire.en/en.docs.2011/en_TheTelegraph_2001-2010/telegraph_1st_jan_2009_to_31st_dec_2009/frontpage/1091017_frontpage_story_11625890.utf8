          RUDRA BISWAS                              
	Ranchi, Oct. 16: Former ministers Anosh Ekka and Harinarayan Rai were today taken to Patna by Enforcement Directorate (ED) officials for questioning in connection with money laundering cases against them.        
	Both the former ministers  lodged at Birsa Munda Central Jail here for possessing assets disproportionate to their known sources of income  were brought in a prisoners van to Sadar hospital here where a health check-up was done by Ranchi civil surgeon.        
	Medical check-ups of the duo were done by doctors at the Sadar hospital. Both of them were found to be in good health, civil surgeon B.K. Singh said.        
	The medical examination over, the duo were lodged back into the prison van and taken to Birsa Munda Airport en route Patna. The duo, escorted by ED officials, were later sent to Patna by a regular Air India flight. At the airport, neither of the former ministers agreed to talk to reporters.         
	Ranchi falls under the jurisdiction of the ED zonal office in Patna. The two former ministers were taken to Patna where in addition to questioning, they will be asked to authenticate various documents seized by the ED officials with evidence of purchasing assets and other properties by them in their own names, spouses and others, ED advocate S.R. Das said.        
	As per the court order, the two ex-ministers are to be sent back to the jail here before the tenth day beginning today, Das added.        
	On October 13, the special court (prevention of money laundering) had allowed the directorate to take the duo into custody for questioning after the agency brought to the notice of the court that they were not co-operating with the probe process and hence their custody was essential in the interests of justice.        
	On October 15, following a prayer by the ED to take the duo to Patna for interrogation, the special court had granted police remand for 10 days effective today.

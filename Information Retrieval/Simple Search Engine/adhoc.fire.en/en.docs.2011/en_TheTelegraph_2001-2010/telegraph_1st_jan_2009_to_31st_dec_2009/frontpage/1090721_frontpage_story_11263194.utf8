                                                                                                           Kasab drops confession bombshell
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                              
	Mumbai, July 20: Ajmal Kasab, the lone 26/11 terrorist captured alive, today made a voluntary disclosure of his guilt in the courtroom, baffling the legal world which was left wondering if the admission was a stunt pulled by a very good actor.         
	Sir, mujhe mera gunah kubul hai (Sir, I confess to the crime I have committed), the 21-year-old told special court judge M.L. Tahilyani.        
	Kasab told the court that Pakistans acceptance of him as a national of that country prompted him to confess  an intriguing statement that came in the middle of a controversy over whether Prime Minister Manmohan Singh conceded too much ground to Islamabad in a joint statement reached in Egypt recently.        
	The Centre has been defending itself by saying that Pakistan had agreed to pursue the 26/11 probe with more sincerity, following which Islamabad had made some legal gestures. However, no official in Delhi would say if Kasabs confession was in any way linked to the recent developments.        
	Special public prosecutor Ujjwal Nikam, who described Kasab as a very good actor, said he was sceptical about the entire act.        
	The cat has come out of the bag. We will analyse his statement and then argue the case. The police and I will try to investigate why he did what he did and the new claims he has made. He has told the court he decided to confess after Pakistan accepted he was a national of that country. This is a big victory for the prosecution. But we have to be careful. This may be a delaying tactic, Nikam said.        
	The scepticism has gained ground because through the confession, Kasab never acknowledged killing anyone  he blamed his slain module partner Abu Ismail. Kasabs lawyer Abbas Kazmi said he was in the dark about the confession.        
	Facing possible capital punishment if found guilty, Kasab ended the confession with a dramatic appeal: Yeh sab khatam karo. Mujhey maut chahiye (Please end all this. I want death). The judge said he would announce tomorrow how the trial would pan out.        
	As Tahilyani gave Kasab permission to speak, the accused No. 1 let it flow and even claimed the involvement of an Indian in the plot.        
	Clad in white kurta-pyjama, Kasab gave a detailed account of the operation, which he said was masterminded by Lashkar-e-Toiba commander Zaki-ur-Rehman Lakhvi, chargesheeted by Pakistan last week.        
	Kasab began with the 10-man squads departure from Pakistan to their landing on Mumbais shores, in four boats. He then detailed the massacre at Chhatrapati Shivaji Terminus and Cama hospital carried out by himself and his module partner Abu Ismail, the murder of some of Mumbais top policemen and his eventual capture.        
	He also gave information about his compatriots responsible for the rampage at the Taj Mahal and Trident-Oberoi hotels, the attacks on the Jewish Chabad at Nariman House and at Leopold Cafe. At least 166 people lost their lives in the three-day horror, around 60 of them at the hands of Kasab and Ismail.        
	Kasab claimed that Abu Jundal, a Lashkar operative he met in Karachi, was an Indian national. Jundal, he said, taught Hindi to the attackers, gave them crucial information about Mumbai and helped them get on to the boat Al-Husseni which brought them from Karachi to Indian waters.        
	Nikam, the special public prosecutor, dismissed the claim. He has some designs in making such a confession because earlier he had never disclosed the involvement of any Indian. I strongly suspect he is not telling the truth, PTI quoted Nikam as saying.        
	Kasab also denied he had killed assistant sub-inspector Tukaram Omble, who physically grappled with the terrorist and pinned him down before he was arrested after a gunfight.        
	I did not shoot him. Both my hands were injured earlier during a firefight with Mumbais ATS chief Hemant Karkares team. The police nabbed our car, opened the front left door and dragged me out. Another group was tackling Abu Ismail, my partner. While police were beating me with sticks, I heard a gunshot and saw Omble fall, he said.        
	Kasab said his Pakistani handlers  Lashkar operatives Lakhvi, Abu Hamza, Abu Qama, Abu Kafa and Abu Jundal  saw them off when they set sail from Karachi. All through his confession, he kept naming his handlers, who gave detailed instructions, maps, weapons and other equipment.         
	He gave the judge details about the contents of the bags of all the attackers  each carried eight grenades, one AK 47, several rounds of magazine and four big bombs when they disembarked from Al Kuber on the evening of 26/11.

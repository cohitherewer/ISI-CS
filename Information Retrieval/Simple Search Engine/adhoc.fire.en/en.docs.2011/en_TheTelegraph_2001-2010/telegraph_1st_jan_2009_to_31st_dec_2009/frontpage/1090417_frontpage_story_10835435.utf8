	Constituency: Manipur Outer        
	Booth: Nepra Company Junior High School        
	Why at 7: Casting of votes is very important as the people in Manipur were generally disinterested in the Delhi election (Lok Sabha polls). But I think everyone should cast their vote. Being a social worker, I have always wanted to serve as an inspiration to others. Also, I have family work to complete        
	Why vote: My vote counts. I want to help install a better government at the Centre that can deliver the goods

	Why vote: My vote is important as it will decide the election of the right candidate         
	Long wait for results: Thats not my worry. But I am worried whether I pressed the right button as I have cataract in my eyes. Let God decide which candidate my vote should go to. He makes the right choice

	Why at 7: I have seen the country under British rule and therefore know what it feels like to be a citizen of an independent country. I took an early bath, did my puja chores and was driven to the booth by my grandsons. Then I had to walk about 60 metres to get to the booth        
	Long wait for results: I am in no hurry. At my age, I have the luxury of taking things at their own pace

	Constituency: Jamui        
	Booth: Chourasa Primary School        
	Why at 7: This is the first time I voted and I was excited. I came home from Punjab for the elections. Also, this is the first time Jamui has been made a constituency and so I wanted to be here

	Place: Cherangre (Meghalaya)        
	Constituency: Tura        
	Booth: Cherangre        
	Why at 7: I walked from my home on the outskirts of Tura to the polling booth. I had to be the first as I can then concentrate on selling vegetables in the market at Ringre, which is 4km from our village. I have to reach Ringre market and find a vantage spot, else I will miss my customers        
	Why vote: There are three women candidates so I, a woman, had to vote. I voted for the best candidate since I hope the person will work for our empowerment, do justice to the demands of vegetable sellers and represent our cause in Delhi

	Booth: Zilla Parishad Primary School        
	Why at 7: In the 2004 elections, my vote was already cast by the time I reached the booth. There were nearly 310 other Venkateshwarlus in this booth. I wanted to be the first so that no one will cast my vote by impersonating me         
	What he doesnt do early: Almost everything. I studied to become a statistician, but became a schoolteacher. I have seen first day shows of NTR and Chiranjeevi films, though not always first show

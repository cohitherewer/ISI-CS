The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Bid to clear Jharnet dues
                                                                                                           Bid to clear Jharnet dues
          AMIT GUPTA                              
	Ranchi, May 11: Jharnet, Jharkhands ambitious e-governance project thats been rocked by controversy ever since its inception four years ago, seems headed for another one with the state administration initiating moves to pay the agency under a cloud for improper implementation of the Rs 100-crore project.        
	As per an agreement signed in 2005, Bangalore-based United Telecom Limited (UTL) was responsible for connecting and ensuring e-governance services in 212 blocks of the state. However, considering the problems of erratic power supply and unreliable Internet connectivity, the number was revised to 183 after UTL pleaded helplessness.        
	It seems now the administration has reconciled to a reality in which a lesser number of blocks would have access to Jharnet  state wide area network (SWAN).        
	Hence, the moves to clear payments, held up since UTL wasnt able to honour its commitment of e-connecting all 212 blocks of the state.        
	Now, the state IT department has roped in Telecommunication Corporation of India Limited (TCIL) as a consultant and software major, Wipro, as a third party monitoring agency, both of whom would file final acceptability tests (FAT) reports.        
	Based on their reports, a decision would be taken to clear UTLs quarterly fee of Rs 5 crore. This would amount to Rs 20 crore in a year and Rs 100 crore in the next five years  the total cost of the project to be executed under build, own, operate and transfer basis.         
	Sunil Kumar Burnwal, additional CEO of Jharkhand Agency for Promotion of Information Technology (Japit), which monitors the Jharnet project, told The Telegraph that after receiving the report from the two agencies, if the state was convinced about fulfilment of shortcomings (if any) by UTL it would start making payments to the Bangalore-based firm.        
	He, however, clarified they would be considering Jharnets performance in the revised list of 183 blocks as the rest still reported issues regarding BSNL connectivity and erratic power supply.         
	As per the original agreement of 2005, it was mandatory for UTL to provide networking in all 212 blocks. But later, considering the problem of connectivity, the number was reduced to 183 blocks. Even now, Japit officials concede that of the 183 clocks, only 150 were connected on any given day.        
	For several days in March and April, BSNL connectivity was switched off after a dispute with UTL on outstandings of Rs 3.5 crore. As per the agreement, UTL was to pay BSNL and get reimbursed by the state. But UTL defaulted on the plea that it had received nothing by way of payment for the Rs 100-crore project. The state had its own reasons for not paying  several remote blocks were yet to have access to Jharnet owing power and leased line facilities problems.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                              
	Calcutta, Sept. 1: No explicit court order was issued against the state governments takeover of Vedic Village land, minister Abdur Rezzak Mollah revealed today, unwittingly striking at the very root of the defence for handing over vested plots to the resort.        
	Besides, the rate at which the land was leased to the promoters of the resort was far lower than not only the then prevailing price but also what the government had charged establishments like hospitals several years earlier.        
	The revelations emerged ironically because of a long media conference held by Mollah, the land and land reforms minister who had cast himself as a vocal critic of the governments policy of acquiring farmland for industry and who is now at the centre of the Vedic Village land controversy.        
	Despite the absence of a clear-cut court order, Mollahs department did not pursue the case against the Vedic Village promoters. Instead, it handed them more than 44 acres at a throwaway price through an out-of-court settlement.        
	Sanjeevani Projects, the original promoter of Vedic Village, had moved Calcutta High Court in January 2003 against the governments decision to vest a large portion of the land the promoters had bought on the ground that the size exceeded the prescribed land ceiling figure. Justice Amitava Lala did not pass an order on the vesting but had restrained Sanjeevani from changing the character of the land.        
	The order did not say anything about vesting but also didnt nullify vesting, Mollah said today.        
	Later, in November 2003, when Sanjeevani moved a division bench of the same court, once again praying for an order against the vesting of their land, Mollahs department agreed to the settlement before the court could pass any order.        
	So, its clear that the government had no legal compulsions to strike the deal with Sanjeevani. Rather, it could have waited for the division bench verdict. Had it gone against the government, it could have moved the Supreme Court to try its luck again, a land department official said.        
	Asked about this, Mollah said: I have experience of cases lying in the Supreme Court. They take 25 to 30 years to pass an order. During that time, I would have witnessed the company going ahead with construction. Instead, the government got 95 per cent of the cost of purchase of land that amounted to Rs 97 lakh.        
	For a minister sworn in to uphold the law, fighting shy of courts citing inordinate delay is an unusual argument. Besides, the government that Mollah represents is not exactly known for getting things done on time.        
	As for the Rs 97 lakh lease money, the amount is peanuts, compared with what the promoters themselves had been charging buyers of plots in the Vedic Village complex to build bungalows. The price the buyers were paying the promoters in 2001  four years before Mollahs department reached the settlement  was Rs 50,000 a cottah, against the Rs 3,670 a cottah the Vedic promoters paid the government upfront.        
	The low rate for the resort land becomes starker when compared with what facilities like hospitals had to pay. In the early nineties, Duncan Gleneagles had paid Rs 3 crore to the Calcutta Metropolitan Development Authority for 8.5 acres to build the Apollo hospital. That translates into Rs 35.29 lakh an acre, against the Rs 2.20 lakh an acre the government got more than a decade later from a resort which involves little public interest.        
	The Apollo land is much closer to the city and will command a higher price but the differential highlights the fact that a resort was showered with more favours than a hospital.        
	 Besides the lease amount of Rs 97 lakh, the Vedic promoters have to pay Rs 88,000 a year as rent for 99 years for the 44 acres. Even if this spread-out cumulative amount is taken into account, the total cost will add up to only Rs 1.84 crore, far lower than what the promoters gain from buyers of the plots.        
	Mollah said he had been to the Vedic Village spa a good number of times.        
	He said the out-of-court settlement with the Vedic promoters had to be made as the government had issued an order to have a long-term lease for vested land which had been unknowingly bought by people in different parts of the state. He cited land around Peerless Hospital, which was vested but unknowingly purchased by people. How can we allow them to suffer? Mollah asked.         
	But the Vedic case was different. The promoters had bought land in excess of the ceiling, following which the surplus land was vested, and cannot claim the status of unknowing buyers. The use of the same model can only be termed blatant benevolence, an official said.

										      Srinagar, July 28 (PTI):   Jammu and Kashmir Chief Minister Omar Abdullah submits resignation letter to Governor N N Vohra after a senior PDP leader alleged in the state assembly that he was involved in the 2006 sex scandal, a charge dismissed by him as false.  In his resignation letter, Omar also asked the Governor to initiate an enquiry into the allegations levelled against him within a specified time frame. "I would be grateful if in a time bound manner you can enquire into the allegations levelled against me at the the earliest," his political Advisor Davender Rana quoted Omar as saying.  Although, quot;there is no question of Governor's Rule in Jammu and Kashmir in the wake of Chief Minister Omar Abdullah's resignation and We shall find a solution to this crisis, quot; says PCC chief Saifuddin Soz.

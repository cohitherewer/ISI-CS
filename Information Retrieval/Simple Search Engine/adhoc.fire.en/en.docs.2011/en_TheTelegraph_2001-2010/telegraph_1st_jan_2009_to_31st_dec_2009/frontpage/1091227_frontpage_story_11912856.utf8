The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | soren stakes claim   Late JD(U) letter adds to suspense
                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                Soren stakes claim     Late JD(U) letter adds to suspense
          SUMAN K. SHRIVASTAVA                                    
	Ranchi, Dec. 26: JMM chief Shibu Soren today staked claim to form Jharkhands seventh government with the help of the BJP, JD(U), Ajsu and a few Independents, ending, at least for now, uncertainties about the political future of the state that has already seen four chief ministers in nine years.        
	Governor K. Sankaranarayanan met the JMM chief and leaders of the BJP and Ajsu around 3pm and accepted a list of 42 MLAs, but did not indicate when they would be invited to form a government.         
	The list included names of MLAs  18 JMM, 18 BJP, five Ajsu and one Independent, Bandhu Tirkey. The JD(U), with two MLAs, was a bit late in making up its mind and it was only around 8.30pm when state unit chief Jaleshwar Mahto, accompanied by BJP leaders, handed over their letter of support to the Raj Bhavan.        
	Two independent MLAs, Chamra Linda and Videsh Singh, were also likely to support the government. But, so far the JMM combine has the official support of 44 MLAs, three more than the required number. I am going to form the government, Soren said while leaving Raj Bhavan. I have a lot of work to do for the people, whom various political parties have ditched so far.        
	According to a power-sharing formula being worked out, the JMM would keep the chief ministers post and three cabinet berths, the BJP will get four berths, the Ajsu three and the JD(U) one. The Speaker is also likely to be from the BJP.        
	We will finalise the issue with Raghubar Das tonight, said senior JMM leader Hemlal Murmu.         
	For 65-year-old Soren, this would be a dream comeback as chief minister, his third since the formation of the state in 2000.        
	If Raja Peter, one of the two JD(U) MLAs supporting him was the reason behind his losing the crown in January  he had lost the Tamar byelection to him then fighting on a Jharkhand Party ticket  he had now been able to avenge the humiliation.        
	Today, Peter was being counted among the MLAs supporting his government, for which he may even be rewarded with a ministerial berth.         
	The irony was also unmistakable in the way the Disom Guru played his cards  no doubt aided by the Congresss reluctance to do business with him  and forced the BJP to accept him as chief minister.        
	In 2000, when Jharkhand was formed, Soren was part of the NDA, but the BJP denied him the top job, saying the post belonged to the party with the highest number of MLAs.         
	Today, among the BJP leaders who accompanied him to Raj Bhavan were Yashwant Sinha, Ananth Kumar, Raghubar Das, Arjun Munda. The Ajsu was represented by its chief, Sudesh Mahto, and C.P. Choudhary.         
	Former BJP president Rajnath Singh, who arrived here last night after being appointed by his successor, Nitin Gadkari, as political manager, did not go with him to meet Sankaranarayanan.        
	The day began with the Congress mounting a last-ditch effort to wean away Mahto and his Ajsu. But Sorens son, Hemant, had already met him at an undisclosed location in Tatisilwai in the state capital where he took his signature on a letter of support.

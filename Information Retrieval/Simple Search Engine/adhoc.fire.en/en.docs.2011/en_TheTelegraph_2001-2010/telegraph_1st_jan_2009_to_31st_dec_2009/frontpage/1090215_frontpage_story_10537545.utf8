The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | US drone missiles kill 27 in Pakistan
                                                                                                           US drone missiles kill 27 in Pakistan
          PIR ZUBAIR SHAH                            A pilotless drone aircraft                                  
	Islamabad, Feb. 14: Two missiles fired from American pilotless drones killed up to 27 people, including Arab and Uzbek fighters of al Qaida and the Taliban, in South Waziristan this morning, according to a Pakistani intelligence official and local residents.        
	The attack, which occurred between 9.30 and 10am (local time), targeted an area close to Makeen, the headquarters of the leader of the Pakistani Taliban, Baitullah Mehsud.        
	The intelligence official said the missiles had hit a mud-walled compound owned by a local resident, Roshaan Khan, in an area said to be a hub of local and foreign fighters aligned with Mehsud and that they could have been intended for Mehsud himself. But Mehsud was not among those killed, said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorised to speak to the press.        
	If Mehsud was the target of the attack, the intelligence official said, it would be one of the first times that American missiles were aimed at the Pakistani.         
	Some Pakistani security officials have complained that the American missile attacks have been aimed solely at al Qaida and Taliban who cross the border into Afghanistan to fight American and Nato soldiers.        
	The officials have said that if the Americans were going to attack targets in the tribal areas, where al Qaida, with the support of the Taliban, have built safe havens, the Taliban that operate against Pakistan should also be targeted.         
	Mehsud is considered responsible for many of the more than 60 suicide attacks in Pakistan last year.         
	The attack followed the statement in Congress yesterday by Senator Dianne Feinstein, Democrat of California and the head of the Senate Intelligence Committee, that the pilotless aircraft take off from a base inside Pakistan.         
	As I understand, these are flown out of a Pakistani base, Feinstein said during a hearing attended by the director of US national intelligence, Admiral Dennis C. Blair. In his testimony, Admiral Blair said that the drone attacks had achieved their goal. Al Qaida today is less capable and effective than it was a year ago, he said.

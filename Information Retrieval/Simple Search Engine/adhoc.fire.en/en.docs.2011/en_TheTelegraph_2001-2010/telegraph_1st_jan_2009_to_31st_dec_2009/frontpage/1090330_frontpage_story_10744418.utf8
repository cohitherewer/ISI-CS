The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | State stays DA hike, Razi draws flak
                                                                                                           State stays DA hike, Razi draws flak

	Ranchi, March 29: The state finance department today clamped a stay on the governors advisory councils March 24 decision to increase dearness allowance (DA) of state government employees by 6 per cent.        
	Joint chief electoral officer Ashok Kumar Sinha said that the issue, after being stayed by the state, had been referred to the Election Commission for its approval.         
	The state swung into action after election commissioner S.Y. Quraishi made it clear yesterday that Governor Syed Sibtey Razi was bound to follow the model code of conduct as the chief executive of the state under the Presidents rule.                    
	The commissioners comment prompted the Opposition BJP to seek recall of the governor. The governor, as the constitutional head of the state, was mandated to protect the Constitution. Instead, he is violating the code formulated by the poll panel, state BJP chief Raghubar Das said, adding that it was not possible to hold free and fair elections under the Razi rule.        
	Das pointed out that the governor had held over half-a-dozen meetings of the advisory council after the model code was enforced on March 2 (see chart).         
	He had taken several policy decisions without taking clearance from the Election Commission with an objective to reach benefits to the Congress, he added.        
	BJP state spokesperson Sanjay Seth put chief electoral officer Debashish Gupta in the dock for not taking suo motu cognisance of the violations of the model code.        
	Das also criticised the governor for taking out full-page advertisements in local newspapers trumpeting his achievements. The Election Commission has already declared that the government must take its approval on fiscal measures, tax cuts and other financial relief, he added.

	Colombo, Feb. 11: To many, Maya Arulpragasam, known as M.I.A., is the very pregnant rapper who gyrated across the stage at Sundays Grammy Awards.        
	Yet in Sri Lanka, where she spent her childhood years, M.I.A. remains virtually unknown. And some who do know her work say she is an apologist for the separatist Tamil Tiger rebels fighting in the countrys long-running civil war.        
	M.I.A.  who has been nominated for an Oscar for the song she co-wrote for the hit film Slumdog Millionaire  has branded herself through music videos and interviews as the voice of the countrys Tamil minority. In the video for her song Bird Flu, for instance, children dance in front of what looks like the rebels logo: a roaring tiger.        
	M.I.A. was born in Britain but moved to Sri Lanka when she was 6 months old so that her father, an engineer and a leader in the Tamil separatist movement, could help fight for an independent Tamil homeland. Her childhood took her across northern Sri Lanka, wracked by insurgency, to India and back to Britain, where her mother and siblings settled into a public housing project outside London. Her father remained in Sri Lanka. She now calls New York home.        
	Being the only Tamil in the western media, I have a really great opportunity to sort of bring forward whats going on in Sri Lanka, she said in an interview on the PBS programme Tavis Smiley last month. Theres a genocide going on.        
	But her political views rankle some people at a time when most Sri Lankans are clutching to the hope that the rebels, branded by the US and European nations as a terrorist group, are on the verge of military defeat by government troops.        
	Frankly, shes very lucky to get away with supporting, even indirectly, perhaps the most ruthless terrorist outfit in the world, said Suresh Jayawickrama, a songwriter based in Colombo.        
	Jayawickrama is from the countrys majority Sinhalese ethnic group, and his reaction is similar to that of many Sri Lankans who know M.I.A.s music. But he also said that M.I.A. deserved credit for her artistry and the fame she had achieved. She really should have a little more recognition in this country, he said.        
	Despite decades of conflict, music has remained largely free of political messages or overtones in Sri Lanka, perhaps because audiences are seeking entertainment and escape from the daily reminders of civil war.

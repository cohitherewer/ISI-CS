          A STAFF REPORTER                            The car at New Town police station. (Tamaghna Banerjee)                                  
	Calcutta, Feb. 6: A 19-year-old student of St Xaviers College out on a spin with seven classmates died after their Toyota Qualis hit the divider on Rajarhat Expressway, spun several times and turned turtle.        
	Abhishek Dass friends, none of whom suffered serious injuries or was flung out, crawled out of the car and were surprised to find him lying quite some distance away, his face smashed.         
	Abhishek was in the middle seat while I was in the front seat. I dont know how he could suffer such fatal injuries, said friend Debaditya Chowdhury. He suggested that Abhishek may have come out of the Qualis on his own and been knocked down by another vehicle, but the police rejected this theory.        
	Abhishek, a bright and popular second-year student of computer science honours, was the only son of Asim Das, a senior public works department official, and Suparna Das, chief clinical psychiatrist at the Indian Institute of Bio-Behavioral Sciences, Calcutta. The couple rushed to Apollo Gleneagles Hospital after Debadityas parents rang them.        
	Debaditya and two other passengers  Arghya Guha and Anuranjan Mitra  too had been taken to the hospital while the rest left the accident site on their own.        
	When Abhishek was brought in, he was already dead, said Arijit Bose, in charge of medical administration at the hospital. He had suffered severe head injury. The rest had minor injuries and were treated and discharged.        
	The eight friends had set out from their Park Street college after their classes got over around 2.30pm, said Debaditya, who had known Abhishek for 12 years since their days at Salt Lake School, CA Block.        
	After driving around Rajarhat for sometime, we were heading towards City Centre (Salt Lake). Our friend Somark Malas was at the wheel  the car belonged to his father. As far as I can remember, the accident took place around 4.40pm, he said.        
	Chandi Charan Jana, a passer-by, said the car was travelling fast before it rammed the divider.         
	It spun several times and came to rest on its roof. The rear windshield was completely shattered, there was glass everywhere, Arghya, one of the passengers, said.        
	When the youths shook off their daze and came out after a few minutes, they noticed a body on the road. I walked towards it and recognised the black Adidas T-shirt. Abhisheks face was smashed, Debaditya said.        
	A police patrol arrived around 4.55pm and took Abhishek and three others to hospital. The police are verifying if the person who drove the Qualis had a valid licence.

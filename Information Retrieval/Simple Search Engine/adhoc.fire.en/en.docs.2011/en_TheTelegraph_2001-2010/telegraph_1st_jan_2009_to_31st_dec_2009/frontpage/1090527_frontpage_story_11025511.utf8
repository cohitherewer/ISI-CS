The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Wind of competitive compassion

	May 26: Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee played the avuncular but uncompromising hygiene enforcer, Mamata Banerjee switched from a train engine to a boat and Pranab Mukherjee asked his lieutenants to fan out.        
	A faint wind of competitive compassion is blowing in pockets of south Bengal, necessitated by the political typhoon two weeks ago and facilitated by the cyclone that devastated vast stretches.        
	The three principal political formations  the Left ruling the state, the Trinamul Congress holding sway over south Bengal and the Congress at the helm at the Centre  have shown remarkable zeal to offer help to those ravaged by the cyclone.        
	Suggestions of any link with municipal polls scheduled a little over a month away in South 24-Parganas  one of the worst-hit districts  are being dismissed as insensitive. But separate events that unfolded today suggest something has changed since the poll results were declared on May 16.        
	Chief minister Bhattacharjee exemplified that change at a college that has been converted into a camp for the displaced at Jamtala in the district.         
	Dont drink this water, Bhattacharjee told a group of people lined up before a tubewell pumping muddy water. He will provide you with clean water, Bhattacharjee said, pointing to the block development officer.        
	It was not clear whether the official could make good the chief ministers promise. But another assurance was kept soon after.        
	When Manikjan Mullick told the chief minister the inmates had eaten nothing but jaggery and puffed rice since yesterday, Bhattacharjee said: Dont worry, we have set up a kitchen and a meal is being prepared for you. The food was served a little later.        
	As the chief minister was turning to leave, Jogen Mandal asked him: Our homes are gone. When can we return home?        
	Bhattacharjee replied: You will get money to rebuild your homes within three days. Within three days, you will get your money.         
	Little of what the chief minister said or did today was extraordinary, but the move to mingle marked a departure from earlier such visits.        
	Although Bhattacharjee used to be sympathetic to the victims, he had earlier largely restricted himself to holding meetings with district officials. Today, he chose to wade into the midst of the people at the camp in the heart of Joynagar that elected a Trinamul-supported SUCI MP this time.        
	The gesture was a throwback to 2001 when an unsure Bhattacharjee was cutting his teeth as chief minister and had travelled to the interiors of Usthi in the same district in a rickshaw-van after a spate of armed robberies there.                     
	Bhattacharjee is now back on a similar unfamiliar terrain after the crushing election debacle of the Left. The uncertainties have been compounded by the natural disaster.         
	Mamata today virtually signalled her intention to consolidate her partys position at the June 28 municipal polls. She wasted no time after taking charge as railway minister in Calcutta to ride a train  in the drivers cabin  and hop on to a steamer to survey the plight of the people in Kakdwip in the same district.        
	The state government has prepared no flood control masterplan. It is I who has spoken to the defence minister, the PMO and the finance minister and managed to get food and packed water air-dropped. It is the BSF which, at my instance, rescued more than a hundred people, she said.        
	Mamata did not meet the displaced people but promised to use her MP funds to build permanent flood shelters.        
	The Congress, too, chipped in. Finance minister Mukherjee said he had asked all state Congress leaders to fan out in the districts to help people. The finance ministry is working on a package of short- and long-term relief measures.        
	The scramble has raised the victims hopes. What matters is that suddenly in the last two days, there is a flurry of activity among the political parties to help us. Three CPM ministers have already visited the area, said Zahir Mollah of Joynagar.        
	CPM state secretary Biman Bose denied any cyclone politics, saying: It is good if all sides extend their hand to help. Let us join hands.                    WITH INPUTS FROM BARUN GHOSH AND BISWAJIT ROY

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Truce with peaceniks under strain
                                                                                                           Truce with peaceniks under strain
          A STAFF REPORTER                                     
	Guwahati, Feb. 9: The honeymoon between the pro-talks Ulfa group and the Congress-led government has come under strain after the peaceniks charge that no party in the state has come to power without the outfits help since 1991.         
	Highly placed sources in the government today said the groups chances of getting its unilateral ceasefire converted into a bilateral one in the near future have now become dim.         
	This is because the peaceniks will be observed even more closely after their accusation, which has come as a bolt from the blue for Dispur ahead of the crucial parliamentary elections.        
	Though the government has been helping the group to settle down and mobilise opinion for lasting peace since they came overground in June last year, it has not formalised any agreement with it yet.         
	The initiative has come under strain. The timing and place of the accusation raises a lot of questions about their motives and intention. There could be more to the accusation than meets the eye and that is why we need to keep an even more close watch on their movements and activities. As things stand today, the scope for an early bilateral ceasefire has been pushed back, one of the sources said.         
	Pro-talks leader Mrinal Hazarika on Friday told reporters in New Delhi about Ulfa commander-in-chief Paresh Baruas links with Pakistans ISI, the outfits training camps in Bangladesh and its relationship with the state Congress and the AGP, the two parties which have formed the government since 1991.         
	The group was in Delhi to discuss about the need to turn Assam into an autonomous area, a demand they had revealed on January 1.        
	The pro-peace group comprises mainly of personnel from the Alpha and Charlie companies of Ulfas dreaded 28 battalion. Upper Assam, the main area of operation of the companies, has been relatively peaceful since the unilateral ceasefire in June.         
	Sources in the state PCC said the party was concerned because such sweeping accusation could be exploited during electioneering and, therefore, there was a need for checks and balances vis--vis the pro-talks group.         
	The government needs to find out why they are revealing such things now. We have suffered the most at the hands of the outfit. And why should we have any truck with Ulfa? We are for lasting peace and we will back any initiative that contributes towards ushering in peace, including the one initiated by the pro-peace group. But that should not give the members of the group the licence to say anything or do anything, one of them said.         
	That the government has taken exception to the accusation was also clear from government spokesperson Himanta Biswa Sarmas comment that having truck with the outfit would only invite a backlash from the public which has suffered at its hands.

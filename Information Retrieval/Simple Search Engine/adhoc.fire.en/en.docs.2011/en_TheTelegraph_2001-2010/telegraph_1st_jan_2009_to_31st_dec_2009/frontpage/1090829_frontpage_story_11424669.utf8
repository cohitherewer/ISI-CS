The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Monitored sale of flu drug
                                                                                                           Monitored sale of flu drug
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                               
	New Delhi, Aug. 28: The government is likely to soon allow prescription-based and audited retail sales of the antiviral drug oseltamivir for use against pandemic flu through a small set of chemists shops across the country, a senior health official said.         
	The drug will be classified under Schedule X, a category of medicines manufactured and distributed only with periodic audits of inventory and sold only when a patient has a prescription, the official said.         
	Under the existing policy, oseltamivir is provided free to patients exclusively at government hospitals and a small number of designated private hospitals. Health officials said retail sale of the drug had been discussed in several internal meetings of the health ministry in recent weeks and will be part of an evolving strategy to respond to the local spread of the pandemic H1N1 virus.         
	Health ministry figures show that among the 139 new H1N1 infections today from 11 states, 134 involved local transmission. Indias total number of cases since the start of the pandemic has climbed to 3,534, and 82 have died.         
	We dont want indiscriminate use and we dont want under-prescription of this antiviral drug, said Surinder Singh, head of the Central Drugs Standards Control Agency, Indias apex drug regulator.         
	Singh indicated that restricted retail sales might be allowed within two weeks.         
	A Schedule X drug is sold in India only through a small number of licensed retail chemists outlets that have to keep duplicate copies of prescriptions on which the drugs are sold for two years.         
	Drug regulators estimate India has only 300 to 350 such outlets. Delhi has about 10 outlets, while Mumbai has about 20 to 25, and some states would have five, a senior drug regulator said.         
	Doctors have welcomed the move, saying it would facilitate rapid treatment of patients infected with H1N1 who have acute illness or are at high risk of severe disease and who need to be treated on the first day of symptoms.         
	I will be glad when this restriction goes away, said Subhash Arya, a senior paediatrician in New Delhi. Under the existing policy, a few patients with even pneumonia have had to wait for a day or two before they got the drug, he said.         
	A doctor who requested anonymity told The Telegraph that he knew of a family who had two persons infected with H1N1 and requested a friend to fly into India with oseltamivir bought in a foreign country.         
	Singh said the inventory of a Schedule X drug is routinely tracked and audited at the points of manufacture, distribution and sale. Doctors who prescribe the drug would have to maintain a copy of the prescription.         
	This makes it easy for authorities to track faulty prescriptions.

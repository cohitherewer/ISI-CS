                                                                                                           Case history
                                            
	Only once in its 59-year history has the Supreme Court showed signs of almost buckling under. It was during Emergency, when it upheld the detention of Jayprakash Narayan, Morarji Desai, Bhimsen Sachar and Madhu Limaye under the much-dreaded Maintenance of Internal security Act, often called Misa.        
	Four judges, including Justice P.N. Bhagwati who later went on penitently, perhaps, to introduce public interest litigation (PIL), toed the government line when they said the right to life ceased to exist during Emergency.        
	One man, Justice H.R. Khanna, gave a dissenting view. It cost him the post. Indira Gandhi got him superseded. That was the lowest point in Indian judicial history, said former additional solicitor-general Altaf Ahmed.        
	Since then, the court has redeemed itself, regaining much lost ground when it came up with its basic structure (of the Constitution) doctrine that cut short Indiras dreams to switch to a Presidential system.        
	That no one could touch the basic structure has been a thorn in the side of all subsequent governments.         
	Proactive judges, such as Justice Bhagwati and V.R. Krishna Iyer, have also changed the way courts function, making them more accessible to the poor. The courts found a way of getting around red tape and encouraged public-spirited individuals or groups to take up issues affecting people through PILs.         
	The courts rulings, expanding the scope of right to life to include clean air, water, surroundings, health, education, employment and sleep, touch the lives of millions, says Ahmed.         
	Judiciary watchers also speak of the Mandal judgment, backing reservations for the backward classes, as an example of affirmative action.         
	Judges, mostly from the higher castes, pushed the case of reservations, Ahmed said, reflecting on the institutions maturity.         
	A mild-mannered Chief Justice of India (V.N. Khare) gave a whip-lashing to the Gujarat government for failing to stick to its Raj Dharma at a time riots there posed a threat to Indian secularism, he added.         
	Indian judiciarys biggest achievement has been to ensure that democracy and rule of law are read together, said constitutional expert Rajeev Dhavan. He contrasted this with the situation in Pakistan. Pakistans judiciary developed a usurper jurisprudence that justified any usurper of power, coup after coup. As a result theres no respect for rule of law there.        
	In India, he said, the judiciary told the executive clearly it cannot abandon the discipline of rule of law, placing us on a par with the best judiciaries in the world.                  
	Lawyer Prashant Bhushan singled out the Best Bakery carnage in which 14 Muslims had been burnt alive. In an exemplary instance of intervention, the apex court transferred the case from Gujarat to Maharashtra for re-trial. But Bhushan lamented that such examples were few.         
	The courts response to new-era terror has been hopelessly inadequate, he said. It has upheld draconian anti-terror laws and the Armed Forces Special Powers Act without addressing human rights concerns.        
	They (Supreme Court judges) have allowed victimisation and prolonged incarceration of peaceful and selfless activists like Binayak Sen (Chhattisgarh doctor who the state claims is a Naxalite sympathiser), he said.        
	This has resulted in a culture of impunity among police. The message is that peaceful protest and resistance are useless, forcing many activists to rethink their strategy.         
	Ahmed disputes the argument. He cites the examples of the Indira Gandhi and Rajiv Gandhi murder cases to argue that the institution has stood its ground on human rights. (The) two Prime Ministers fell to terror. But many were acquitted for lack of evidence.         
	The only other possible aberration was the Union Carbide case, where the court let those guilty of causing the worlds biggest industrial disaster walk free in return for a compensation that was inadequate, a keen judiciary watcher said. Three lakh people died in that incident but no one was taken to task, said an old-timer.         
	Dealing with dissent has been another challenge. Arundhati Roys faceoff with the apex court was symptomatic of the courts intolerance to dissent, Ahmed said.        
	Burgeoning costs of litigation and delays have added to public disillusionment with the system. Corruption has become an issue after one former chief justice famously said that 20 per cent of judicial officers were suspect.        
	More recently, the court has tied itself in knots over its refusal to reveal assets of judges under the right to information act. The judges, who are in the business of judging others, should also be willing to be judged, Ahmed said.        
	Bhushan has other grievances against the system. It is anti-poor, he said. The apex court has time and again refused to recognise the rights of slum-dwellers. It is pro-capitalist. Whenever it has had to choose between human rights and environment, it has chosen environment. But whenever it has had to choose between human rights/environment and corporate development, it has chosen corporate development.         
	Another judiciary watcher said: Criticism-wary judges go by the letter of the law and not the spirit, denying justice to many.         
	Bhushan, an active campaigner for change in the judiciary, was emphatic that the institution was on the decline.         
	So will Justice Khannas spirit of law prevail and the judiciary correct itself or its status be reduced to, in Justice Stables words, mice squeaking under a chair in the Home Office?         
	Much will depend on how the judiciary responds to public demands to ensure quick, transparent justice. If they (apex court judges) can ensure that criminalisation of politics is addressed, they will make a major breakthrough, Dhavan said.         
	Besides, they should put their house in order. They should not give the impression they have something to hide, Ahmed added.                    SAMANWAYA RAUTRAY

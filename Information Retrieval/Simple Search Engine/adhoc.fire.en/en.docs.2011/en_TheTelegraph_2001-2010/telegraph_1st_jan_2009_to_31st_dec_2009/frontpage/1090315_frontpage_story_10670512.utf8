The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | CPI, BJD agree to share seats
                                                                                                           CPI, BJD agree to share seats
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Bhubaneswar, March 14: The CPI has indicated that the Third Front was ready to accept Naveen Patnaik as a key ally whenever he wished to join, a day after its general secretary A.B. Bardhan met the Orissa chief minister and agreed to share seats with the Biju Janata Dal in the forthcoming general elections.        
	The CPI chief said he held preliminary discussions with Naveen last night and both agreed to share seats. But the details were yet to be worked out. Talks will start within two-three days and the seats to be shared are expected to be finalised by March 20, Bardhan said today, adding that the CPI had constituted a negotiating committee headed by state secretary Dibakar Nayak.        
	On the possibility of BJD joining the Third Front, he said: Last night, Naveen ruled out joining or supporting a BJP-led or Congress-led formation. If he does not want to go either with the BJP or the Congress, its obvious that he will go with non-BJP and non-Congress parties. Let him have his own time.        
	Though Bardhan was hopeful of BJD ultimately joining the Third Front, Naveen remained non-committal. Its too premature at this moment, he said last night. Asked as to how many seats CPI wanted to contest in Orissa, Bardhan said it depended on the outcome of negotiation with BJD.                     
	We will submit a list of Lok Sabha and Assembly seats we want to contest. Lets have a talk and everything will be known by March 20, he said.                          
	On the question of a Third Front prime minister, Bardhan said they would not like to project any candidate for the top job. There are a number of candidates. Lets wait for the Lok Sabha poll results first, the CPI general secretary said.        
	Stating that there was no point projecting any prime ministerial candidate before the polls, he asked: What happened to L.K. Advani?         
	Asked how many seats the Third Front would secure in the coming elections, he said: We expect to win more seats than the UPA and NDA. Already 10 non-Congress and non-BJP parties have come together and we have appealed to others to join us, he said.        
	On whether Mulayam Singh Yadav would join them, Bardhan said: Earlier, he was with us, but he broke away. He has to answer this question first.

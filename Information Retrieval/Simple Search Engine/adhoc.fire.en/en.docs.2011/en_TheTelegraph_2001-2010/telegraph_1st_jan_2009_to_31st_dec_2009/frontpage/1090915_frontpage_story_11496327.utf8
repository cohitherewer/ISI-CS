	New York, Sept. 14: Kim Clijsters dropped down on her knees in disbelief, and then looked to the stands to find her golden-locked daughter, Jada, up way past her bedtime so she could see her mother spin a fairy tale.        
	Clijsters, the 26-year-old wild-card entry from Belgium who was a former No. 1 player, left the game two years ago to start a family and returned to tennis just one month ago.        
	Suddenly on Sunday night, she had captured the 2009 US Open title by dispatching 19-year-old Caroline Wozniacki of Denmark 7-5, 6-3 in 1 hour and 33 minutes before an adoring crowd of 23,351 at Arthur Ashe Stadium.        
	Jada flashed on the giant screen in the stadium, pointing and hamming it up with the same infectious joy her mother had supplied to cap the most unexpected womens Open in memory, one marked by charming upsets, unsettling anger and disruptive rain.        
	I cant believe this has happened, its still so surreal, that in my third tournament back I won my second Grand Slam, Clijsters said more than an hour after the match. Its a great feeling to have, but its confusing in a lot of ways that it happened so quickly.        
	It has been four years since Clijsters last played in New York and won her first Grand Slam title. She has played exactly 14 matches in 27 months, and watched as the rest of the womens field at the Open crumbled under emotions or the weight of expectations she did not carry.        
	This has been so exciting for me, it was not really our plan, she said. I just wanted to get back into the rhythm of playing tennis. I have to thank the USTA for giving me a wild card for coming here.        
	It was not until a weak lob from Wozniacki floated above her like a gift on match point that Clijsters knew she could reclaim the title. She slammed the overhead with ease, punctuating her return.        
	Clijsters was the first unseeded woman to win the US Open, at least in the Open era, and in the process she became the first mother to win a Grand Slam title since Evonne Goolagong Cawley won Wimbledon in 1980.        
	As Clijsters laughed at her 18-month-old daughter, who was still wide awake around 11pm, she told the crowd: We tried to plan her nap time a little bit later. Its the greatest feeling in the world being a mother.        
	The final seemed a bit anticlimactic, in the wake of the previous nights controversial semifinal between Clijsters and Serena Williams.        
	On Sunday before the match, Clijsters did not watch the endless replays of Williamss meltdown. Instead, she watched the animated film Ice Age with Jada and her husband, Brian Lynch.        
	Watching her daughter scamper on court, twirling and entertaining the assembled photographers, Clijsters and her husband felt great delight. She just thought it was the most normal thing, I guess, Clijsters said.        
	Jada may not remember the night, but Clijsters will have a tale to tell her years from now  and the pictures to prove it.

  - Manipur Opposition party seeks Sonia Gandhis intervention to resolve crisis        OUR CORRESPONDENT                                          
	Imphal, Aug. 24: Students today joined the oust Okram Ibobi Singh campaign in protest against the July 23 killings while Opposition Manipur Peoples Party urged AICC president Sonia Gandhi to intervene in the state.         
	In its memorandum, signed by party president Nimai Chand Luwang, the MPP accused the chief minister of handing out a concocted story of the city shootout in the Assembly, triggering a mass upheaval against his government.         
	The MPP said normal life in Manipur was completely paralysed and the situation might go out of control if the turmoil was allowed to continue. Stating that the chief ministers resignation was the only remedy, the party demanded his replacement.         
	We gave Ibobi Singh time to gracefully resign on moral ground. We will not rest until he is ousted, Luwang said.         
	The MPP has twice submitted memorandum on the same demand to Governor Gurbachan Jagat.         
	The police story is that former militant Ch. Sanjit, while firing at them, killed a pregnant woman, Rabina Devi, and the police shot dead Sanjit in an exchange of fire.        
	The people have, however, rejected the police claim and are demanding Ibobi Singhs ouster and punishment to the commandos responsible for the fake encounter. The agitation is being spearheaded by Apunba Lup, a conglomeration of NGOs.         
	The protesters have been staging sit-ins and taking out torch-lit rallies. As a wave of protests swept the twin districts of Imphal East and West, the government clamped curfew in the disturbed areas.        
	Students delegates had submitted two memoranda to the governor earlier this month, demanding lifting of the curfew. Today they staged sit-ins for justice and a peaceful academic atmosphere.        
	Students of Ananda Singh Higher Secondary School in Imphal East skipped classes and staged a sit-in at the gate of their school this afternoon. They held placards like Resign killer CM Ibobi, Punish criminal commandos and Repeal Armed Forces Special Powers Act.         
	Students of Churachand Higher Secondary School, Ibotonsana Girls Higher Secondary School and two other government schools and a private school in Imphal East and West districts also staged sit-ins.         
	We are holding the sit-in in support of the peoples demand for resignation of Ibobi Singh and punishment to the police commandos, a student leader said.         
	The governments failure to deliver justice in the July 23 case and the subsequent unrest is seriously affecting the academic atmosphere. Curfews and bandhs are not allowing us to pursue our career. Our demand is deliver justice and maintain a peaceful academic atmosphere, a Class XI student of Pioneer Academy, Imphal East, said.         
	The students were, however, soon dispersed by police teams, which threatened them with sticks. Classes resumed after the brief sit-ins. There were also reports of students holding sit-ins in Bishnupur and Thoubal districts.         
	About 100 women also held a sit-in at Lamsang in Imphal West. They shouted slogans, demanding Ibobi Singhs resignation, and burnt effigies of the chief minister and his wife Landhoni Devi.         
	Night curfew is still on here. It is relaxed from 4am to 6pm every day.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Pak finds new Enemy No 1
                                                                                                           Pak finds new Enemy No 1
  - India dislodged by US in twin messages to Manmohan          SANKARSHAN THAKUR                                                     
	New Delhi, Aug. 13: Prime Minister Manmohan Singh may be terribly right, and fairly wrong, about pursuing peace with Pakistan even in the face of domestic cries of surrender following his joint statement with counterpart Yousaf Raza Gilani at Sharm-el-Sheikh.        
	A Pakistan Gallup survey, commissioned by Al Jazeera, has revealed that for the first time since Independence, and happily, India has been unseated as Enemy No 1 in Pakistani eyes. Conversely, the poll also revealed that the top slot has been grabbed by the US, the nation Manmohan Singh has pegged as Indias most loved and favoured.        
	The Pakistan-wide urban-rural poll conducted in the last week of July (sample size 2,662) says only 18 per cent of Pakistanis believe India is their main enemy; 59 per cent now think it is the US. There perhaps exists only one reference point to such a poll  a Gallup survey conducted five years ago, around the time the UPA first came to power, said 72 per cent Pakistanis thought India to be their biggest adversary.        
	The surveying agency said it had spoken face-to-face to those sampled for opinion and reckoned the error margin to be plus-minus 2-3 per cent.        
	These results may well be more revelatory of street sentiment in Pakistan over relentless US-driven drone attacks and ground military action in Taliban-dominated Swat and mountainous regions bordering Afghanistan, but the poll may also indicate a concurrent groundswell of desire for peace with India.        
	The Pakistani establishments response to Indian concerns over the export of terror since the Sharm-el-Sheikh joint statement has been fairly inconsistent.         
	Although the trial of those accused for plotting the 26/11 Mumbai terror strike is proceeding tardily in Pakistan, the Jamaat-ud-Dawa chief, Hafiz Sayeed, considered the fount of the anti-India terror infrastructure, has been allowed to go free for lack of evidence.         
	Over the past week, New Delhi and Islamabad have also traded words over whether Pakistan had really claimed the Mumbai terrorists to be its own nationals.        
	Despite Pakistani intransigence over the nitty-gritty of acting against the Mumbai plotters, New Delhi remains keen on taking forward the dialogue process, firm in the belief that it is the only way ties can be normalised or improved.        
	As of date, formal meetings between the two foreign secretaries, followed by the foreign ministers, on the sidelines of the UNGA in September are on.        
	An official source in South Block told The Telegraph: What the Prime Minister said about continuing dialogue remains a reality, whether it can graduate to a process of comprehensive dialogue will depend on whether Pakistan takes demonstrable, sustainable and credible action against the terror infrastructure.         
	It is clear from the Gallup survey that the Pakistani national mood is currently rather shaken and layered on the course the crisis-ridden country should take.        
	While an overwhelming majority seems to prefer peace with India  a victim of terror  a more overwhelming number considers the US  protagonist of the global war on terror  its chief threat.        
	Significantly, 67 per cent of Pakistanis opposed US drone attacks (in one of which the Pakistani Taliban chief Baitullah Mehsud is reported to have been killed recently), and only 41 per cent favoured military action against the Taliban; 43 per cent favoured political dialogue with the Islamists.        
	In another key revelation that could point the way to who India should be talking to in Pakistan, the survey said 42 per cent of Pakistanis thought President Asif Ali Zardari was bad for the country; only 11 per cent thought he was good.        
	But then, in what is another indication of a splintered nation, Prime Minister Yousaf Raza Gilani, (currently believed to have the backing of the armed forces and the ISI) did not win that poll against Zardari.        
	The winner for most popular leader of the country was the man still waiting in the wings for his turn  PML leader Nawaz Sharif, with a 38 per cent approval rating as opposed to Gilanis 11 per cent.        
	In what could be good news for democratic and secular institutions in Pakistan, only eight per cent favoured a resort to military rule, and fewer, only six per cent, wanted to be ruled by religious parties.

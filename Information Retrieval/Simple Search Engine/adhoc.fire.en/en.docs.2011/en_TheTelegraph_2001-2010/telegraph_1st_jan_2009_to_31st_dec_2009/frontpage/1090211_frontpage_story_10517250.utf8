	Bangalore, Feb. 10: An American Golden Sentry will inspect aircraft that will fly the Indian President, Prime Minister, defence minister and very important persons to verify that the planes are not being misused.        
	The head of the US military sales agency disclosed here today that India has signed an End-User Verification Agreement (EUVA) for three Boeing Business Jets (BBJs) that it bought recently for the countrys rulers. The third BBJ was delivered last month to the Indian Air Forces Headquarters Communications Squadron  as the VVIP squadron is called.        
	The EUVA is implemented through the Golden Sentry programme governed by the US defence department (the Pentagon) and the Blue Lantern programme governed by the state department. All direct foreign military sales are monitored by the Golden Sentry.        
	This week, India is also expected to present a new draft for an omnibus end-use and enhanced end-use verification programme, the Pentagons chief military sales officer and head of its defence security co-operation agency, Vice Admiral Jeffrey A. Wieringa, said here today.        
	I was present at the meeting between Mr (A.K.) Antony and Mr Gates (US defence secretary) during the defence ministers visit to the US. The feeling I got was that we are very very close (to signing the agreement), said the admiral.         
	We are delighted with your defence minister Antonys stand, the admiral added. Antony was in the US from September 7 to 10 las year.        
	The Left had strongly objected to the EUVA when it partnered the UPA coalition and remains opposed to it even now. It alleges that India is signing away authority to the US that a sovereign country ought not to. After his US visit, Antony had said no contentious issue was discussed.         
	Wieringa also confirmed that the Golden Sentry had applied to and would apply to all military sales authorised by the US defence department to India. US inspection teams verify that the military platforms it has exported are being used for their stated purposes every year. Much of this involves on-site verification.        
	Some of the weapons platforms to which the Golden Sentry applies or will apply are the USS Trenton, now the INS Jalashva, the amphibious vessel with six onboard helicopters and landing craft, AN/TPQ 137 Firefinder weapons locating radars with the Indian Army, and six C-130J Hercules transport aircraft for the special forces.         
	A contract for eight P8i maritime surveillance aircraft by Boeing for the navy will be governed mainly by the Blue Lantern programme but its armaments will be under the Golden Sentry. A similar arrangement has been adopted for the VVIP jets.         
	The US deputy chief of mission, Steven J. White, said the US had EUV agreements with about 80 countries.        
	The cabinet committee on security has been looking into the EUV deal, a logistics support agreement and a communications interoperability security agreement, for two years. A forward movement was confirmed only today.        
	India has never disclosed that it had already entered into separate EUV agreements for each of its military acquisitions from the US. Wieringa said it was Delhi that wanted an omnibus agreement to avoid bureaucratic delays in drafting EUV agreements for each purchase. This is also indicative of a willingness in India to buy more US-made military equipment.        
	At Aero India, the military aviation show that begins here tomorrow, the US is the largest presence in terms of space with aircraft custom-made for India in the hope of winning tens of billions of dollars worth of orders, including the prized $12.5-billion-plus deal for 126 multi-role combat aircraft.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Scientist wanted $2m for secrets
                                                                                                           Scientist wanted $2m for secrets
                                Stewart D. Nozette                            
	Washington, Oct. 29: A scientist who played a key role in Indias Chandrayaan-1 moon mission wanted $2 million for his secrets and stashed 55 gold Krugerrand coins worth about $50,000 in a California safe deposit box, federal prosecutors said.        
	The disclosure came in court papers filed late yesterday, in which prosecutors urged a federal judge to continue the pre-trial detention of Stewart D. Nozette, 52, who was arrested on October 19 on charges of selling classified information to an undercover FBI agent posing as an Israeli intelligence operative.         
	Prosecutors said Nozette posed a grave risk to the national security and was a flight risk. Nozette met the agent twice in recent weeks and exchanged sensitive information for $11,000 via a US post office box in Washington DC.         
	He worked as a contractor for Nasa and the defence department from 2000 to 2006, and had held other sensitive government jobs over the years. Nozette pleaded guilty in January to overbilling the US government by about $265,000. The case was sealed because Nozette was cooperating with authorities investigating unrelated corruption charges.

	Washington, Sept. 7: Whales have songs, and so do birds, of course. But does music lift the spirits of a swallow? Do humpbacks hum to make themselves mellow?        
	Although bird songs and many other animal vocalisations have been the subject of intense scientific study, the effect of music on the moods of creatures other than humans has remained mysterious. If anything, research has suggested that animals are indifferent to human music.        
	But a provocative new study, spawned by an unusual partnership between a cellist with the National Symphony Orchestra and a psychologist at the University of Wisconsin at Madison, has provided some of the first evidence that humans are not the only species whose heartstrings are pulled by music.        
	Weve basically shown for the first time that the components of music that seem to be important in affecting us emotionally are also the same components that affect other species, said Charles T. Snowden, the Wisconsin psychologist who teamed up with David Teie of the National Symphony Orchestra.        
	Snowden has spent years studying a diminutive species of monkey known as the cotton-top tamarin. These tamarins live in the rainforests of Central and South America and are known for their highly complex and frequent vocalisations.        
	Teie, who also teaches music at the University of Maryland in College Park, contacted Snowden in the hopes of exploring his ideas about the emotional effects of music. He thinks music has roots in the most primitive, earliest sounds to reach our ears.        
	After studying Snowdens extensive catalogue of recordings of tamarin calls and spending a couple of days in Madison making his own recordings of the primates, Teie set out to compose music tailored to the tamarins. My idea was, theres no reason for Barbers Adagio for Strings to bring tears to the eyes of a tamarin, Teie said. So I made a special kind of music just for them.

          PRATIM D. GUPTA                                                    
	Calcutta, Jan. 22: Slumdog Millionaire may not have to wait till -day to rake in the millions at the Bollywood box office.        
	Although Oscar trophies have generally given a boost to the winning movies at the Hollywood box office, this time just the nominations at the Academy Awards  a whopping 10 at that  coupled with the four Golden Globes will spell gold for Slumdog.        
	The timing couldnt have been any better for Danny Boyles small little indie film, which packs Bollywood masala into Hollywood storytelling.         
	In hindsight, it all looks like a well-planned marketing campaign. But no one could have anticipated the Golden Globe triumph on January 11, when the promotion around the India release began. Or the 10 Oscar nominations just a day before the film releases across the country.         
	No wonder, Slumdog Millionaire, which was till a couple of weeks back just another English movie about India, will release tomorrow with a total of 400 prints nationally. With all the buzz around, it looks like the calculated risk from Indian distributors Fox Star Studios may turn out to be an inspired move.         
	A new print of Vikas Swarups book Q amp;A, from which Oscar-nominated screenwriter Simon Beaufoy adapted the script, is out with the title changed to Slumdog Millionaire and the lead pair of Dev Patel and Freida Pinto on the cover.         
	Even Bollywood releases seem to have stepped aside in the wake of the Slumdog slam. The one-week-old biggie Chandni Chowk to China, Warner Brothers first major Hindi film production, has bombed so badly that its almost off the theatres within seven days. Aamir Khans Ghajini might have made quite a few crores but the December 25 release has very little trace left.         
	Raaz 2, Luck by Chance and Dev D, the new Bollywood releases in the coming weeks, may turn out to be successful but not big enough to challenge the Slumdog onslaught.         
	Not only the English version, even the Hindi version (Slumdog Crorepati) should do very well in the days to come. We are looking at a total haul of Rs 4-5 crore in just the first week, which is huge for a non-Indian release, said trade analyst Taran Adarsh.         
	Shah Rukh Khans home production Billu Barber on February 13 is perhaps the first box-office roadblock for Slumdog before the Oscars are announced on February 22. Ironically Irrfan, one of the stars of Slumdog Millionaire, plays the lead in it.        
	Nepal bans CC2C        
	Nepal today banned the Akshay Kumar-starrer Chandni Chowk to China after protests by students who claim the film distorts history by portraying that the Buddha was born in India.         
	Information and communication minister Krishna Bahadur Mahara said: The decision to ban the film has been taken on security grounds. The foreign ministry would lodge a formal complaint with India, he added.         
	The film released last Friday. On the order of the censors, cinemas in Nepal deleted a scene where Akshay is introduced as a person who was born in India, the birthplace of the Buddha.         
	But the students claimed DVDs freely circulating in Kathmandu contained the scene.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Kitchen gas, oil cheaper
                                                                                                           Kitchen gas, oil cheaper
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                               
	New Delhi, Jan. 28: The Manmohan Singh government did tonight what it has never done before: reduce the price of cooking gas.        
	Domestic cooking gas price has been cut from midnight by Rs 25 a cylinder, petrol by Rs 5 a litre and diesel by Rs 2 a litre, the government said.        
	The reduction will mean domestic LPG in Calcutta will cost Rs 327.05 a cylinder, petrol Rs 42 a litre and diesel Rs 31.74 a litre.        
	The price of cooking gas, often considered the fuel of the relatively better off, is being scaled back for the first time since 2002  two years before the current UPA government assumed charge.         
	Some state governments, including Bengal, had reduced local taxes in between to lower the overall LPG price but the current Centre on its own had not done so till now. In fact, in June last year when global oil prices were shooting up, the cooking gas price was raised by as much as Rs 50 a cylinder.        
	Tonights reductions, which follow a steep fall in global prices and precede the general election expected in a few months, came a day after Sonia Gandhi said she hoped fuel prices would be cut soon.         
	We are giving relief to housewives, railway minister Lalu Prasad said after a cabinet meeting this evening.         
	This is the second reduction in auto fuel prices in two months  a trend in line with the dip in global crude oil markets.         
	After the latest round of reductions, state-owned oil firms will make a profit of Rs 4.86 on every litre of petrol sold and Rs 1.48 on diesel.        
	However, on LPG, their losses per cylinder will rise from Rs 32.97 to Rs 57.97, because of which oil companies had opposed the reduction in cooking gas prices. This is on top of the Rs 12.16 they have been losing on each litre of kerosene.        
	No decision was taken today to free the pricing of auto fuel.

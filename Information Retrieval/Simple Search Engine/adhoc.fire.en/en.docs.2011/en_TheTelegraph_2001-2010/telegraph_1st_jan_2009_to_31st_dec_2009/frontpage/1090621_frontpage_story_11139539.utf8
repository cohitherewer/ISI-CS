          ROYA NIKKHAH                            Jobs: Part-time plans                                  
	London, June 20: Steve Jobs, founder of the computer firm behind the iPhone and iPod, has received a liver transplant, it has emerged.         
	Jobs, chief executive of Apple, had the operation around two months ago.         
	The Apple chief, who has previously battled pancreatic cancer in 2004, went on medical leave from the electronics giant in six months ago, to treat an undisclosed medical condition, thought to be a hormonal imbalance.         
	His gaunt and pale appearance at an Apple conference in January this year sparked further fears about his health.         
	Rumours about Jobss health have persistently caused fluctuations in Apples share price.         
	Several Apple directors are believed to have known of the surgery, which Jobs received in Tennessee.         
	He is said to be making a good recovery and is expected to return to work later this month, but may initially resume his position part-time.         
	Tim Cook, Apples chief operating officer, may continue to manage the companys daily operations when Jobs first returns. A spokesman for Apple said: Steve continues to look forward to returning at the end of June, and theres nothing further to say.        
	Jobs dropped out of college to start Apple Computers in his parents garage in 1976 with his friend Steve Wozniak.         
	He was ousted from the company in 1985 but returned 12 years later and engineered a revolution in the companys fortunes, based on sales of iPods and, most recently, iPhones.         
	Apple unveiled its eagerly-awaited new iPhone 3GS last week. The phone, which costs up to 274, is expected to sell out of shops within the first week of its launch.

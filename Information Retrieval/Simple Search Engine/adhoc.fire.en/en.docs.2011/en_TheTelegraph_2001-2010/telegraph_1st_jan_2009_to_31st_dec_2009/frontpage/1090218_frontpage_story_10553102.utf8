The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Trek to a rival empire
                                                                                                           Trek to a rival empire
  - What makes Naxalites fight a losing war           SANKARSHAN THAKUR                             Pandu, head of the east Bastar chapter of the Dandakaranya Peoples Government                                        
	Dandakaranya Forests (Bastar): A lugubrious full moon is weighing itself up behind the craggy hill and, the days work done, the peoples government of Dandakaranya is settling down to another night at the office.         
	Dinner must be cooked for the ranks, the ill and the battle-scarred taken care of, arms and ammunition secured, the night guard posted, the informer network whistled afresh into alert and the route to tomorrows camp headquarters mapped.         
	The roll calls just over and the tasks handed out; itll be a long night like every other, and an early morning, everyones at their stations.         
	Its an open-plan workplace, a bivouac scattered under a ragged forest canopy that defies address  somewhere in east Bastar, we are told, no more. We have no way of being wiser.         
	Shortly after we were picked up at our pre-arranged rendezvous on the highway, we became Hansel and Gretel in the hands of our changing guard  we had no notion of where we could be, much less of how to trace a path back.         
	A short dusk-hour break in a village courtyard, then a motorbike dash by dark deeper into the jungle, the rutted road having lapsed into a dirt track cutting through an obstacle course  underbrush and unploughed fields, causeways and riverbeds, sandy humps and troughs, even a precarious stretch of plateau. The bike leapt and dove, catching, at one point, a pack of rabbits startled by the headlights.         
	Another village, another walled courtyard, another halt, this time with a piping meal of rice and dal. A short nap and after that another change of guard and another stretch ahead, on foot. Deeper in, deeper through the dark amid the eerie howling of dogs, or were they jackals? Four hours later, a little past daybreak, we were delivered to the headquarters of a rival sovereignty  the bereft and nebulous empire of Bastars Naxalites.         
	Somewhere along the trek we had crossed an invisible line and entered the slipstream of a contrary world, another country. No passports asked for, no visas stamped, but the crossover was no less for the absence of those formalities. Allegiances had been reversed, legitimacies flipped, definitions turned on their head.         
	When Comrade Pandu, de facto head of the east Bastar chapter of the Dandakaranya Peoples Government, talks of the enemy, he means police and the paramilitary; when he refers to imperialists, he is referring to the Government of India; when he talks about loyalty and commitment, which he does often, he talks about loyalty and commitment to the scrapping of the Constitution and the overthrow of the governance system it has ordained.         
	Welcome to the peoples republic, he tells us, fist clenched and raised, Its a sham democracy you come from, it works for 5 per cent of the people and kicks the rest where it hurts most, it must be deposed.         
	Left to him, Comrade Pandu, gaunt and forever Guevara-like about his headgear, would have shot the enemy regime dead with a burst of his AK-47, a prize, he proudly tells us, from the lightning raid on the Nayagarh armoury in Orissa in the February of 2008.         
	But thats a far fantasy and Pandu is no dreamer, even though he dreams an improbable dream  violent overthrow of the current system and the establishment of a Federal Union of Peoples Democratic Republics of India.         
	We are embryonic, we have no illusions about that, we are not strong enough to headquarter our government because we cant defend it, we are weak compared to the might of the state we fight, but that is no reason to give up. Revolution will not be born if there is no embryo.         
	The camp is thick with shadows shuffling about in the dark, guns slung over their shoulders. Some of the weaponry, like Comrade Pandus, is sophisticated, but most of it of dubious vintage and even more dubious ability. Shivlal, teenaged and barefoot, carries a single-bore that he says he has never fired. Never needed to, he says.         
	But what if someone takes aim at him? He bares a fine, full set of teeth. They havent made a bullet with my name on it. Utterly filmi yet utterly craftless, a confidence deeply swigged in the headiness of youth.                     Women cadres at a camp    
	His leader may often sound equally intoxicated. Comrade Pandus exposition on eventual aims and objectives in this moonlit theatre might often tempt you into thinking youve entered the rehearsal rooms of an ultra-Marxist skit, a fanciful indulgence that cant be for real. But little in this story is fictitious other than the names of characters that populate it  Comrade Pandu, for instance, isnt the mans real name, but he and his mission are real enough.         
	These are men and women who have forsaken more commodious  if also more ordinary  lives elsewhere in the pursuit of belief. They have lost  and taken  lives, thousands of them over the past decade of resurgence along the countrys famished eastern flank, right down from Bihar to Andhra Pradesh through Orissa and Chhattisgarh. They bear, as a collective, a formidable and ominous sounding title bestowed by the Prime Minister, no less  the biggest internal security threat to India, a virus that needs to be wiped out.         
	Comrade Rupi  its the name of a jungle bird, not a virus, she sharply reminds you  would gladly return the compliment. Its about how you view the world, she says. From up there we might look like a virus to the system, from down here, the system looks like a virus. What has it given the vast majority of this country? Sixty years after so-called Independence, nothing has changed for most, things have gotten worse.         
	But for her guerrilla fatigues and her ease with guns, youd mistake her for a schoolteacher  shes thin as a reed, bespectacled and soft-toned. She is also, like most of the Naxalite vanguard in these jungles, from Andhra Pradesh.         
	Long back, she says, Andhra was long back, at least eight years. I hear my mother cries for me sometimes, but that is all right, this is more important, the fight we set out to fight. I jumped off the fence and committed myself, I did not come here to go back.         
	Is it getting anywhere, though, this fight, or is it just meandering about in this wilderness day after day, camp after makeshift camp?         
	Again, it depends on the way you look, Rupi counters, eyes focused on the far woods. There is a fight to be fought for people who have nothing and someone has to fight it. If we were doing so badly and if this were so meaningless, do you think we would have earned that dubious description from the Prime Minister? If you like, thats one of the things that keeps me going day after day, night after night.

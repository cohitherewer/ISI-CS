  - Speaker showcauses PA Sangma amp; sons          OUR CORRESPONDENT AND PTI                                    
	Shillong, May 8: Congress and Nationalist Congress Party leaders today met in Delhi to finalise the modalities of forming a coalition government in Meghalaya, while Speaker Bindo Lanong served showcause notices to NCP leaders P.A. Sangma and his two sons for switching allegiance.        
	The NCP, led by Sangma, was part of the Meghalaya Progressive Alliance  the United Democratic Party is the other arm of the coalition  that held power till Presidents rule was declared in the state.        
	While P.A. Sangma is still the chairman of MPA, Conrad Sangma is one of the secretaries and spokespersons of MPA.         
	James Sangma is the convenor of the committee on common minimum programme of the MPA.        
	Acting on a complaint filed by MPA legislators Ardent Basaiwmoit (UDP), Manas Chaudhuri (Independent) and Nimarson Momin (UDP) that the NCP legislators had violated the spirit of anti-defection law by holding frequent meetings with the Congress in Delhi, the Speaker today issued the notices.         
	He said it is a prima facie case of disqualification and has given the legislators seven days to reply.         
	While the Speaker pondered on the disqualification clauses, the NCP leaders thrashed out the final modalities with the Congress in Delhi.        
	We have made some breakthrough. We have accepted the NCPs offer to join hands. We are finalising the modalities, Congress leader and former deputy chief minister Mukul Sangma told PTI in Delhi.        
	Meghalaya was brought under Presidents rule on March 19 after dismissing the Donkupar Roy-led MPA government.        
	The 60-member Assembly, where Congress has 26 MLAs and NCP 14, has been kept under suspended animation since then.        
	With the chances of installation of a government, likely to be headed by veteran Congress leader D.D. Lapang, the Union cabinet may recommend lifting of the Presidents rule tonight.        
	NCP leader P.A. Sangma and Congress leaders Ahmed Patel and Luizinho Faleiro have held several rounds of meetings in the national capital during the last few days to sort out their differences, sources said.         
	According to the arrangement, the Congress will get the posts of chief minister and Speaker and NCP will get the post of the deputy chief minister.

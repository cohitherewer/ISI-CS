The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Nano goes to the grassroots
                                                                                                           Nano goes to the grassroots
          OUR BUREAU                                              
	April 8: The Nano has breached another Rs 1-lakh barrier in an attempt to reach out to the grassroots.        
	SBI has decided to lower the income eligibility criterion for car loans to Rs 75,000 from Rs 1 lakh a year. This means a person earning Rs 6,250 a month or a little over Rs 200 a day can now seek finance to buy the car.        
	Now individuals with a monthly salary of Rs 6,250 are eligible to get finance for the Nano, an SBI official said.        
	But buyers looking to book the Nano will have to carefully weigh their interest rate options. Tata Motors  which opens the booking window tomorrow for the Nano  has put out a list of 19 banks and non-banking finance companies and the upfront booking amounts.        
	On the face of it, Canara Bank offers the cheapest option with a prospective buyer having to stump up Rs 2,850 for the base model under the financing segment. The total booking amount for the base model is Rs 95,000.        
	Most of the state-owned banks are locked in a close band, requiring customers to put up between Rs 2,950 and Rs 2,999 to book the car. But a few others are asking for more: Central Bank (Rs 3,256), State Bank of Indore (Rs 3,516), Punjab National Bank (Rs 3,733) and United Bank of India (Rs 3,137). The finance companies will be charging slightly more than the banks.        
	This amount, ranging between Rs 2,850 and Rs 3,733, will be forfeited if the customer doesnt get an allotment after a computer-generated random lottery in July and chooses not to keep his booking alive.        
	The buyers will have to really chew over their financing options if they try to factor in the cost of converting their booking loans into auto retail loans. Under the procedure, customers who financed their bookings have the option of converting their booking loans into auto retail loans.        
	United Bank of India is offering the cheapest auto retail loan at 9 per cent. Most others are charging between 11 and 11.75 per cent. Penalties may result if a customer tries to change the financier after receiving a firm allotment.        
	Some banks are offering an interest band, either because of the loan tenure or the credit risk profile of the borrower. As a large number of buyers are expected to be those seeking to upgrade from two-wheelers, bankers are worried about a possible surge in bad loans.

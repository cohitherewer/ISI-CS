          LALMOHAN PATNAIK                              
	Cuttack, Feb. 25: The Cuttack-Bhubaneswar police commissionerate has launched an online hunt for 29 most wanted criminals accused in 140 cases of murder, rape, robbery, dacoity and cheating.        
	The list has been put up on the commissionerate website  www.bhubaneswarcuttackpolice.gov.in/most_wanted.php  for further information on those eluding arrest and subsequent trial for more than a few years  some of them since 1999.        
	Commissionerate officers said they were leaving it to the public hoping that they can help us catch them.         
	So far, the forces efforts to nab the criminals, who operate in areas under different police stations in Cuttack-Bhubaneswar urban districts, have failed, mainly because of an information gap regarding movements and hideouts.         
	The website unfortunately carries pictures of only 13 of the 29 criminals. Since most of them are dreaded gang leaders they manage to buy people or terrorise them into keeping their hideouts a secret.        
	Biban Biswal, one of the three accused in the 1999 Anjana gang rape, is still evading arrest. The police managed to arrest the two other accused, who were later convicted and sentenced to rigorous life imprisonment in 2002, but failed to trace Biban.         
	Dhal Samant brothers, the accused in the Bidanasi murder, that had created a stir in October 2006, are still absconding. Both Susant Dhal Samant, 39, and Susil Dhal Samant, 36, who had gained notoriety in 1993-94 are accused in two other murders in Bidanasi and Lalbag and are also accused in cases of murder, dacoity and robbery.         
	The duo are still beyond the polices reach even as reports indicate that they have been spotted since then in Bidanasi and parts of Cuttack. In fact, last week one of the Dhal Samant brothers had attended a birthday party at Panchamukhi Hanuman Temple under Madupatna police station area where he had threatened a guest with a gun.         
	A short request  if you have any information, please share it with us. Your identity shall be kept secret  precedes the list on the web.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Blanket flu scan advised
                                                                                                           Blanket flu scan advised
  - Everyone with symptoms urged to approach designated hospitals; home treatment allowed for mild illness          G.S. MUDUR                      Rida Sheikh, the   14-year-old girl who died in Pune on Monday                                
	New Delhi, Aug. 4: India dramatically changed its pandemic flu fighting strategy today, asking everyone with symptoms to seek help from a small set of public hospitals across the country and opening a window for home treatment.         
	A day after a 14-year-old girl died of pandemic flu in a private hospital in Pune, the health ministry released revised guidelines that urge any person with a running nose, sore throat, cough or fever to visit any of a set of designated government facilities for a clinical evaluation. Doctors there will determine whether the patient needs to be tested for the pandemic H1N1 virus.         
	This does not mean everyone will be tested, a senior health official said, emphasising that a doctor would decide whether a test was warranted.         
	Patients who test positive for H1N1 but have mild symptoms will have the option of isolation and treatment at home. Almost all patients in India so far have had mild illness.        
	Until now only persons with flu symptoms who also had a history of foreign travel or known contact with an infected person were offered the diagnostic test for H1N1 that is available only at 18 government laboratories in India.         
	Medical experts who had argued that the earlier testing policy was flawed because it was likely to miss patients who pick up the infection locally have now dubbed the new testing guidelines unrealistic and obviously temporary.         
	Not everyone with such symptoms will be able to even reach designated hospitals, said a doctor who has been advising the government on flu policy.        
	While Delhi has 13 designated hospitals, most other states have one or two such facilities. Bangalore and Calcutta, for instance, each have a single hospital with doctors specially trained to determine whether a person would need H1N1 testing. In Calcutta, it is the Infectious Diseases Hospital, Beleghata.        
	The flu season is beginning  were likely to be swamped by people with these symptoms, a senior chest physician said.        
	Public health specialists believe the guideline asking every patient with symptoms to visit a government facility is likely to be only a temporary step until capacity to handle the infection is built up in the private sector.        
	 As the pandemic evolves in the country  as we get more and more cases  the policy will need to change again, said Randeep Guleria, professor of medicine at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi.         
	We may reach a stage in the pandemic when we do not need to test individual cases and treatment might be provided only to a subset of people who are at high risk of developing serious disease, Guleria told The Telegraph.         
	Guidelines from the US Centers for Disease Control and the World Health Organisation lay out well-defined criteria on who needs to be tested and who needs to be treated with the anti-viral drug oseltamivir, he said.         
	Health ministry officials said they were developing a plan to circulate the criteria for testing and treatment to private medical institutions, although the modalities of doing this were still to be worked out.         
	Public health experts and virologists said the girls symptoms and the spread of H1N1 virus among schoolchildren in Pune in recent weeks should have prompted doctors at the private hospital to suspect pandemic flu and send her samples for testing earlier.         
	The number of laboratory-confirmed cases of H1N1 in India has climbed to 574. The virus has infected people in at least 45 cities. But over 470 patients have been discharged.        
	The virus has infected more than 134,000 people across 135 countries and killed 816.              
	NEW GUIDELINES: YOUR QUESTIONS        
	 What has changed?        
	Till now, those with symptoms of flu were tested for H1N1 only if they had travelled abroad or had come into contact with an infected person.        
	From now on, anyone with a running nose, sore throat, cough or fever needs to visit a designated government hospital for a clinical evaluation. A doctor will use clinical criteria to determine whether a test is required or not        
	 Where is the designated test centre in Calcutta?        
	The National Institute for Cholera and Enteric Diseases on the campus of the Infectious Diseases Hospital, Beleghata. The centre can test 25-30 samples a day. The test is not available in the private sector        
	 How much should I pay for the test?        
	The test is free. Each test costs the government Rs 10,000        
	 What is the treatment if I test positive?        
	In India, currently all patients found infected with H1N1 are quarantined at a government hospital and given anti-viral drug oseltamivir. The treatment usually lasts five to seven days. Some countries give themedicine only to high-risk patients or those with severe symptoms. Those with milder symptoms recover after symptomatic treatment, such as with paracetamol to reduce fever, and bed rest        
	 Cant I be confined to my home and treated?        
	Yes, if the symptoms are mild. The government on Tuesday allowed home confinement for mild cases        
	 How do I know if I have severe symptoms?        
	You have severe symptoms if you have high-grade fever that lasts more than three days, breathing difficulty even with mild activity, non-dry cough or coloured sputum, drowsiness, chest pain or low blood pressure        
	 How do I know if I am a high-risk patient?        
	You are in the high-risk group if you are pregnant, a child below 5, a person above 65, a person with underlying chronic pulmonary illness such as asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or cardiovascular disease, diabetic or obese        
	 Are there enough anti-flu drugs in the country?        
	As of now, yes. India has a stockpile of 10 million dosesof oseltamivir and another 6 million as reserve. Oseltamivir is now available only at designated government hospitals in all states        
	 What precautions should my family and I take?        
	Cover with hand or tissue paper coughs and sneezes        
	Wash hands often with soap and water        
	If you have running nose, sore throat, cough or fever, stay away from educational institutions and work for seven days        
	If treating an infected person at home, wear face mask        
	If face mask use not feasible, maintain a distance of 8ft from patient        
	Sleep and nutrition are important to maintain immunity

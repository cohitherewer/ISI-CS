	Ranchi, Dec. 22: Counting tomorrow for the five-phased Assembly elections in Jharkhand is expected to throw up a hung Assembly, forcing both the Congress and the BJP to revisit their stated positions in their search for partners who they hope can take them towards the magic figure of 41 to form a government.        
	At the centre of that search is Shibu Soren and his Jharkhand Mukti Morcha, which has deftly changed tack to declare that its doors were open to both the BJP and the Congress which had dumped it to join hands with Babulal Marandis JVM and fight the Assembly elections together.        
	The BJP maintains its confident of making up the numbers along with ally, the JD(U). But privately, senior leaders like former chief minister Arjun Munda and others admit that only if they manage anywhere close to 35  in a House of 81 MLAs  will they press ahead for forming a government.         
	Otherwise, the BJP seems resigned to sit in the Opposition.        
	Soren is only too happy to be back in the spotlight. The key to forming the next government is with me. The BJP is not an untouchable for us. If the NDA or UPA wants our support, they should approach us, he said in Bokaro yesterday.        
	He also went out of his way to trash Union minister and Ranchi MP Subodh Kant Sahay for his comment that the JMM and the RJD were natural allies of the Congress  even calling him greedy for power  making it clear that the JMM was neither a part of the UPA nor the NDA.        
	The BJP, too, returned the JMMs compliment. Nobody is an untouchable in politics, clarified state BJP president Raghubar Das, but hastened to add that his party was hopeful of an absolute majority, something it was denied in 2005 when it was forced to take the help of independents.        
	Jamshedpur MP and chairman of the BJPs state election campaign committee Arjun Munda, however, said his party would not attempt to form a government if it did not have the numbers. We will sit in the Opposition and not try to cobble up numbers by hook or crook, he maintained.        
	Sahay, a front runner for the chief ministers post if the Congress-JVM alliance comes to power, has tried to open up channels of communication with both the JMM and the RJD.         
	He has also reached out to Ajsu chief Sudesh Mahto, who denies politics was discussed when the two met on a flight to Delhi a couple of days back.         
	On his part, Marandi sent out a cautionary message to his ally, the Congress. We are ready to sit in the Opposition, if the alliance did not come anywhere near the magic figure. I believe that a government should be formed for the people and the development of the state and not for power, he told The Telegraph, indicating his opposition to getting close to the JMM.        
	If the NDA or the Congress-JVM alliance failed to get a majority, then Ajsu and the JMM would play an important role in government formation. But, irrespective of whoever JMM goes with, it is likely to bargain hard  Soren still harbours hopes of becoming chief minister as published in The Telegraph on 20 December.        
	A fractured verdict would also be a blessing in disguise for the RJD, which is hoping for a scenario that would eventually force the Congress to take its support to form a government, thereby paving the way for Lalu Yadav to renew his ties with the party.         
	Of the 1,493 candidates that contested the elections, the JMM put up the maximum at 78. The BJP contested 67 seats and JD(U) 14, while the Congress fought 61 along with JVMs 20  there were friendly fights in five seats.        
	The RJD contested 56, the Ajsu 58, Trinamul Congress 37 and CPI(Marxist-Leninist)-Liberation 35.

	Guwahati, July 18: Assam police tonight alerted people of an Ulfa plan to carry out blasts here in the next few days.        
	Bhaskar Jyoti Mahanta, the inspector-general of police (law amp; order), said the militant outfit had recruited a college student to plant bombs in the city. The bombs have already been handed over to the student, he said.         
	Mahanta appealed to the student to desist from such an act and approach the police immediately.                    
	 We will not cause any harm to him if he approaches us.         
	The IGP also requested the people to inform the police if anything suspicious was noticed.

          SUMAN K. SHRIVASTAVA amp; PINAKI MAZUMDAR                                                     
	Ranchi/Jamshedpur, Dec. 10: The state administration and security forces face their first serious test on Saturday when 14 Assembly constituencies go to vote in the fourth phase of elections spread over six districts that are either Maoist strongholds or under the grip of their breakaway group, the PLFI.        
	Despite a Maoist poll boycott, the Assembly elections so far have been relatively peaceful with the overall turnout hovering between an encouraging 52 per cent and more.         
	For the fourth phase of voting, the Election Commission has relocated as many as 161 booths in the regions of Ghatshila, Manoharpur, Chakardharpur, Simdega, Torpa, Kolebira and Lohardaga where campaigning came to an end today.        
	Joint chief electoral officer Ashok Kumar Sinha said the booths (37 in Manoharpur, 22 in Gumla, 39 in Bishunpur, 16 in Torpa, three each in Ghatshila and Potka, 11 in Ichagarh, four in Simdega, seven in Kolebira and nine in Lohardaga) had been relocated due to security reasons, a move that proved fruitful in the earlier three phases.         
	Most of these constituencies are sensitive, said South Chhotanagpur DIG R.K. Mallick, but we have taken foolproof security measures.         
	DIG (Kolhan) M.K. Mishra also expressed confidence that security arrangements in Kolhan would prove adequate. I cannot disclose details, but we have made foolproof arrangements to prevent any untoward incidents, he said.         
	All the areas have seen an unprecedented number of state and central forces that have been deployed strategically after careful scrutiny of the terrain. Though the police would not reveal the exact number of securitymen, sources said around 40,000 jawans and officers had been deployed.        
	We have six helicopters which will be used for air surveillance as well as ferrying poll officials. We have adequate number of strike reserve forces, too, said state police spokesperson and IG (human rights) V.H. Deshmukh.        
	Over 24 lakh people are expected to vote in 14 constituencies where 233 candidates are contesting in the fourth phase of elections at a time when the primary political formations have begun to admit, albeit in private, that the state was headed for a hung House yet again.        
	Half the 14 seats are in East and West Singhbhum, while the rest are in Gumla, Simdega and Khunti districts. The JMM has five sitting MLAs in the 14 seats, while the BJP has four, Congress three and UGDP (Joba Manjhi) and Jharkhand Party (Anosh Ekka) one each.        
	If the emerging political scenario is hazy, it is because both the Congress and the BJP failed to narrow focus their campaign on corruption and price rise, two issues that would have touched a chord with the electorate.        
	It left the space for the elections to be decided by local factors and personal relations of candidates with voters, pointed out Harishwar Dayal, an expert who has been studying previous elections in the state.         
	However, Congress state president Pradeep Balmuchu, locked in a triangular contest in the Naxalite-hit Ghatshila constituency, claimed the Congress-JVM alliance was the only alternative which could provide a strong and stable government in Jharkhand.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Rs 950cr on way to save forest land
                                                                                                           Rs 950cr on way to save forest land
          ANTARA BOSE                               
	Jamshedpur, Sept. 29: Jharkhand is all set to get Rs 950 crore from the Compensatory Afforestation Fund Management and Planning Authority (Campa) to rejuvenate over 4,000 hectares of forests as a part of a nation-wide effort to promote afforestation in areas where forest land was used up for development projects.        
	In Jharkhand, 4,700 hectares of land, mostly in districts of Hazaribagh, Ramgarh, Giridih and Chatra, have been identified for various afforestation programmes, the proposal for which has already been sent to the Union ministry of environment and forests.        
	We hope to get a notification soon, said C.R. Sahay, the principal chief conservator of forests, who will be co-ordinating the programme in the state.        
	Work should start from October or November. Of course we will have to seek the approval of a number of authorities in between, after which the money will come to the state Campa account, he added.        
	The regeneration project in the districts would concentrate on compensatory afforestation in double degraded land, safety zone reclamation around a 7.5-metre radius of a mining area, catchment area treatment and tree plantation below transmission lines.         
	Compensatory Afforestation Fund Bill, 2008, was introduced by the Union ministry of environment and forests to streamline efforts at regenerating forests by setting up Campa which would be responsible for managing the fund and deciding on issues such as compensation or identifying land for afforestation.         
	One of the main objectives of the Forest Conservation Act, 1980, was to promote afforestation to compensate for the massive diversion of forestland for development.         
	But with states having failed miserably in regenerating forests, the Supreme Court in 2002 asked the Centre to set up a separate compensatory fund. From 2002, states have been contributing to the fund that has so far remained with the Centre.        
	This money will now go back to the states in phases for conducting afforestation programmes. The first tranche will be around 10 per cent of the corpus.        
	The total amount to be disbursed  via a central ad hoc Campa  for all states was around Rs 11,000 crore.        
	States would also have its own Campa with a governing, steering and executive committee through which the funds would be channelled. And in order to keep a check on its use, the Centre has formed an advisory council to be headed by Jairam Ramesh, the Union minister of state for environment and forests.         
	The comptroller and auditor-general of India will undertake audits both at the Centre and at the state ensuring proper utilisation of funds.

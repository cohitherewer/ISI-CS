  - Producers slap ban but not all are worried          SAMYABRATA RAY GOSWAMI                            Nandana Sen in a still from Rang Rasiya                                        
	Mumbai, March 12: The two Cs that entertain India are both on a sticky wicket.        
	The Indian Premier League, the cricket tamasha scheduled to start on April 10, is tangled in security issues. Now it appears that even cinema will take a hit because of a standoff over profit-sharing between distributors and multiplex owners.         
	Producers and distributors have decided that no new film would be released from April 3.         
	To drive home the point, the Film Producers Guild and the Indian Motion Pictures Producers Association  the two most powerful producers bodies  have decided to give the go-by to single screen theatres as well.        
	As of today, this applies to Bollywood and Hollywood releases. But this could also stretch to regional films. We are in talks with them to ensure a blanket blackout of all releases in cinemas  multiplex or single-screen, said Mukesh Bhatt, chairman of the Film and Television Producers Guild.        
	Among the films due for release in April are Anil Kapoors Shortkut, Ketan Mehtas Rang Rasiya, Mukta Arts Paying Guest and Sohail Khans Kisan.         
	Multiplexes shrugged off the impending blackout, some are even relieved as they wont have to compete with the IPL.        
	How long will they hold out? They will have to exhibit their films after all. The timing of the ban is perfect for us. The IPL is a major killer for multiplexes, it keeps the audiences away. It is good not to have new releases now, for us as well as for them, said an official with PVR Cinemas.        
	Producers and distributors allege the multiplex owners short-change them. The multiplex owners act difficult while sharing profits in the initial four weeks of a films release. Once a big-budget film or a big-star-cast film is released, multiplex owners squeeze in as many as 18 to 20 shows that help them rake in the cash. But the worst part is that they do not share the percentage of profits with the distributors, said producers association secretary Anil Nagrath.        
	Although executives of multiplex chains like PVR, BIG cinemas and Fame refused to comment officially, off the record most said the ban was a ploy by producers to save face.        
	Film after film is taking a beating at the box office  and it has nothing to do with quality or content. The recession is keeping audiences away. The small producers have no option but to release them. But big producers, who rule these trade bodies, are using the rift with multiplex owners as an excuse to hold back releases. There are absolutely no big-ticket releases till June, said a Fame Adlabs official.        
	The last big budget film to release was Delhi 6, which hasnt fared too well, according to trade sources.        
	Smaller films like 13B, Dhoondte Reh Jaaoge and Karma Aur Holi, which released on March 6, had average collections of 10-15 per cent.        
	Even Oscar-winning Hollywood films such as The Reader, Milk and The Curious Case of Benjamin Button fared badly with 10-15 per cent. The presence of Aishwarya Rai Bachchan could not rescue The Pink Panther 2.        
	To lure audiences, Mumbai multiplexes have slashed ticket prices by 20 to 50 per cent.        
	Our rates are really low now and encouraged by them, people are coming in to watch movies they might have missed or avoided, or simply to get the multiplex experience since it is so affordable now, said the PVR official.        
	PVR Cinemas is now charging between Rs 70 and Rs 250 per ticket  a reduction of Rs 50 per screening.        
	Single-screen theatre owners agreed with their plex counterparts.        
	When even a Shah Rukh Khan movie like Billu failed to draw the crowds, I was perplexed. Content, recession, security fears  whatever it is  the crowds are staying away. I reduced rates for Billu from Rs 120-180 to Rs 65-85. Still nothing changed. In this situation, a ban by distributors and producers on releases is a godsend. They think they are teaching us a lesson. But we are relieved that at least, we will save on running costs, said Manoj Desai of Mumbais G7 cinemas, a collection of single screen theatres.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | BJP trumps Cong on tie-ups
                                                                                                           BJP trumps Cong on tie-ups
  - Friendly fights give away JMMs seat deal nervousness          SUMAN K. SHRIVASTAVA                                    
	Ranchi, March 30: If pre-poll alliances hold the key to success in the forthcoming battle of the ballot, the NDA is having the last laugh with rival UPA unity cracking up under the weight of demanding partners.        
	This time, the BJP has already sealed a 12:2 seat sharing understanding with the JD(U), no doubt a fallout of the bitter lessons of 2004 when the NDA felt the heat of a fragmented alliance and the BJP ended up being trampled in Jharkhand for not tying up with the JD(U) and the All Jharkhand Students Union (Ajsu).         
	And if the Congress-JMM understanding has all but collapsed this time, 2004 was definitely better for the UPA. The Congress had then managed to form a coalition of parties like the JMM, RJD and CPI, and the UPA pulled off a stunning show, winning 13 of the 14 Lok Sabha seats.         
	Now five years later, it is the BJP which looks comfortable, having sealed a deal with the JD(U), ignoring the rumblings of dissent from within. Though the Ajsu is not part of this club, its strategy is not to harm the prospects of BJP nominees.         
	For instance, in Jamshedpur, the Ajsu has fielded former BJP leader Shailendra Mahto who has the potential of cutting into the JMMs vote bank. But it has decided against a nominee in Ranchi as it would have effected the chances of BJPs Ram Tahal Chaudhary.         
	The UPA has more reasons to be worried this time. On paper, the Congress has extracted a 8:6 deal with the JMM, provoking the RJD and LJP to contest nine (4:5) seats. Lalu Prasad is also said to be backing Independents like Madhu Koda and Stephen Marandi who could play spoiler for Congress, JMM nominees.                           
	At the ground level, both Congress and JMM leaders arent sure the deal means much. No wonder, they have opted for friendly contests in Hazaribagh and Koderma.         
	JMM leaders admitted they were under immense pressure to allow more friendly fights with the Congress in other seats too. Their apprehensions have been proved right by the actions of Congress veteran Thomas Hansda who switched over to the RJD to put putting the sitting JMM MP from Rajmahal, Hemlal Murmu, on a sticky wicket.         
	Besides, UPA nominees will also have to contend with the anti-incumbency baggage. Though the state is under Presidents rule, the ineffectiveness of successive governments headed by Madhu Koda and Shibu Soren is sure to haunt them.         
	The success of the Congress, JMM and RJD was largely due to the pre-poll alliance which also led to a formidable social coalition that provided the edge, said Harishwar Dayal, who analysed the 2004 elections on behalf of the Delhi-based Centre for Study of Developing Societies (CSDS).         
	Studies of how parties have fared in Jharkhand revealed that the BJP not only won a large number of seats, but polled larger percentage of votes too. During the 1998 and 1999 Lok Sabha polls, the BJP polled more than 45 per cent votes and bagged 12 and 11 seats respectively. In 2004, it polled only 33 per cent of the votes, he added.         
	It was while contesting the 1991 elections that the JMM in alliance with the Janata Dal managed to win six of the 14 Lok Sabha seats, he added.         
	BJP legislator Sarayu Roy said even though the NDA unity seemed stronger than the UPA, things would work out only if the BJP was able to organise a cohesive poll management team at the state level.         
	He was hinting at how Arjun Munda was busy fighting his own battle in Jamshedpur, leaving Raghubar Das to handle the partys campaign in the state.         
	The Congress, however, felt the people would ultimately decide which coalition would work. We couldnt seal a deal as our partners did not agree to a consensus formula for assessing political strengths. On the other hand, the NDA was on cloud nine in 2004 as it was in power, said Congress spokesman Mohan Prakash.         
	This time, the electorate will support the Congress on the basis of the five-year performance of the Manmohan Singh government, he added.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Beauty regimen for Jewel at gym
                                                                                                           Beauty regimen for Jewel at gym
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Guwahati, June 6: When Dima Halam Daogah (Jewel) cadres were bleeding and burning North Cachar Hills, the outfits top leader, Jewel Gorlosa, was busy working out in an air-conditioned gym in Bangalore and pampering himself with costly anti-ageing treatment, hundreds of miles away from the blood-splattered hills of Assam.        
	He was apprehended from this very gym by a crack team of Assam police whose personnel enrolled themselves in the health club to keep an eye on the most wanted militant leader.        
	Director-general of Assam police G.M. Srivastava told reporters today that the man who has held NC Hills to ransom for several years was spending over Rs 60,000 per month on his healthcare and beauty regimen.         
	After Gorlosa was picked up from the gym on Wednesday evening, two of his associates, Partho Warisa alias Ahshringdaw and Samir Ahmed, were picked up from different locations in Bangalore with the help of Karnataka police.        
	All three were remanded in National Investigative Agency custody for 14 days by chief judicial magistrate, Kamrup, Robin Phukan after the police produced then in court today amid high drama.        
	Wearing balaclavas and surrounded by gun-toting police commandos, the three were brought to the court in a white Tata Sumo and promptly taken inside to avoid the media.         
	After the court accepted the plea for remand, the three were whisked away to an undisclosed location.        
	The NIA, which was formed after the Mumbai terror attack, is also investigating the link between Mohit Hojai, the chief executive member of the NC Hills Autonomous Council who has been remanded in its custody for 10 days, and the DHD (J).        
	The DHD (J) today announced a three-month unilateral ceasefire. ( )        
	Gorlosa will be booked in eight cases in NC Hills district and three in Guwahati, the DGP said.        
	Srivastava said Gorlosa had travelled to Bangalore from Nepal around February-March and was in the process of procuring a passport in the name of one Debujit Sinha when sleuths caught up with him. He already has a Nepal passport in the name of Birbahadur Chetri.        
	We had information that Gorlosa was hiding in Nepal and were trying to track him down through diplomatic channels and other contacts in that country. Then we got to know that he was in Bangalore, the DGP said.        
	A seven-member team of Assam police, led by deputy inspector-general of police (central western range) G.P. Singh was sent to Bangalore on May 31.                          
	Singh, who was also present in the jam-packed news conference, said the team first tried to locate Gorlosa and then followed his movements for the next few days.         
	Our men also joined the gym to which Gorlosa was a regular visitor. We picked him up from the gym on Wednesday evening with the help of Bangalore police, the DIG said.         
	Subsequently, the police searched Gorlosas flat, which he had rented for Rs 9,000 per month. They recovered four mobile phone handsets, bank documents, a driving licence in a fake name, a fake identity card, Rs 21,000 in cash, a laptop, an Internet data card and one 2GB pendrive from there.        
	The same evening, they picked up his two accomplices from different locations in Bangalore.        
	Srivastava said Samir, who hailed from the upper Assam town of Dibrugarh and was an employee of HSBC Bank in Bangalore, was a classmate of Warisa, the deputy commander of the DHD (J), from their students days in NC Hills and the duo had maintained contact since.         
	Samir provided logistical support to the two militant leaders in Bangalore, the DGP added.        
	Srivastava said Warisa was spending most of his time in night clubs and was leading a Bohemian lifestyle in Bangalore, spending money at will.        
	Gorlosa kept in touch with his commander-in-chief Niranjan Hojai and cadres through e-mail. Niranjan is hiding in a southeast Asian country, he added.        
	The DGP claimed that Gorlosa was staying in the house of a woman who is close to Hojai, when he was in Nepal. This woman, who is also a social worker, has close links with the film industry of that country. I dont want to reveal the name due to diplomatic reasons but we will take up the matter with the authorities in Nepal.        
	He said the DHD (J) chief had purchased immovable properties in Nepal  in Kathmandu and in Bhairabi bordering Uttar Pradesh  with the womans help.        
	When asked how the arrest of Gorlosa would affect the outfit, the DGP said there was information that the groups cadres were shocked on hearing the news. It cannot be said how the outfit will react to the development, but all we know is that it was a big blow.         
	He said some DHD (J) cadres had planned to attack Naga villages in NC Hills in retaliation to Gorlosas arrest but the security forces got the scent of it and foiled the attempt.        
	Srivastava said things were not going right for the DHD (J) in recent times, with the lower level cadres taking decisions on their own.         
	The local leaders had taken decisions on a few of the recent attacks in NC Hills, he said, adding that each of the five local leaders of the outfit has about 30-45 cadres under them.        
	The DGP said the outfit was trying to set up base in Bangladesh with the help of NDFB chief Ranjan Daimary. Frankie Dimasa, the outfits foreign secretary, who was killed here on Wednesday night, had just returned from Bangladesh where he met Daimary and the outfit was about to sent 30 cadres to Bangladesh to undergo training under Daimary, he added.        
	Srivastava also claimed that Ulfa commander-in-chief Paresh Barua was taking refuge either at Yunnan Province in China or in a tea estate in Bangladesh in which he had a 60 per cent stake.

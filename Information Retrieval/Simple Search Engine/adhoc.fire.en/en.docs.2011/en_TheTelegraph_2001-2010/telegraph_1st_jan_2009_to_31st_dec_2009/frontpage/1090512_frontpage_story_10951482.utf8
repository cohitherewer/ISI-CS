                                                                                                           Kasab giggles at AK-47
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                            Kasab: Smiles all the way                                  
	Mumbai, May 11: Show him the gun he used to kill a police officer, and Ajmal Kasab doesnt even try to look grim.        
	In fact, the baby-faced assassin cant stop laughing in court.        
	The Pakistani gunman, the only one taken alive during the November 26 attacks, continued to smile away as a police officer told the special court how Kasab shot assistant sub-inspector Tukaram Oomble and identified the AK-47 he had used.        
	When the assault rifle was shown to him, Kasab giggled. Then he looked at the media box to his left with a wide grin.        
	Special court judge M.L. Tahilyani, who looked annoyed, asked Kasab to behave. Yeh serious baat hain. Koi natak nahi ho raha hain yahan (This is a serious affair. No drama is being staged here), the judge said.        
	It wasnt the first time that the judge had rebuked Kasab, who has been smiling away in court from the day the trial began in the heavily fortified Arthur Road jail.        
	Sub-inspector Bhaskar Kadam, the first of the 106 prosecution witnesses in the case, identified the AK-47 that Kasab used to kill Oomble.        
	Kadam, who was leading the police team that captured Kasab, also identified two 30-calibre pistols manufactured by Diamond Nedi Frontier Arms, a company based in Pakistan. Kadam also identified the clothes Kasab and his slain partner Ismail Khan wore.

                                                                                                           Dread of drought in weather data
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                               
	New Delhi, Aug. 7: India appears trapped in a state of meteorological drought this monsoon with the rain deficit across the country rising this week to 25 per cent, new data from the India Meteorological Department show.         
	The rain shortages have worsened in all regions except for pockets of the east and the northeast, the IMD said in its first rainfall analysis after the monsoon seasons midpoint on July 31-August 1.         
	The rain deficit for the country rose from 19 per cent on July 22 to 25 per cent on August 5. In the northwestern region a major grain-producing zone  the rainfall has been 40 per cent below normal.         
	A senior weather scientist said the farther away from the midpoint, the lower the chance that rainfall during the rest of the season would be able to make up the shortage.         
	The longer we wait for the revival, the lower its chances of changing the seasons (rain) amount significantly, the scientist said. Agrometeorology teams are now attempting to simulate the impact of the poor rains on crops to predict yields in different states. One analysis conducted last week indicated that the yields of paddy in Assam, Bihar and Uttar Pradesh were likely to drop by at least 10 per cent.         
	The IMD had, however, predicted that monsoon activity was likely to improve over the coming week with a strengthening of wind flows over the Arabian Sea. It said parts of Uttar Pradesh and Bihar would also receive increased rainfall over the next two days.         
	Scientists have some clues about the poor monsoon behaviour. The anticipated rise in the sea surface temperatures in the eastern Pacific Ocean  the phenomenon known as El Nino which is unfavourable for rains in India  has occurred and may impact rainfall in the coming weeks, a weather researcher said.         
	The sea surface temperatures over the equatorial Indian Ocean just west of Indonesia have also been slightly higher this year, which might prevent monsoon weather systems from moving northwards, the scientist said.         
	Indias last major drought was in 2002.        
	Our bureau adds: Finance minister Pranab Mukherjee conceded in the Lok Sabha today that the poor rainfall might set back the economy that had started gathering pace. The economy has started moving slightly, but other problems may come from an adverse impact of scanty rainfall.        
	Monsoon concerns, combined with weak global cues, dragged down the stock market for the second consecutive day today. The sensex ended 354 points lower against its previous close, losing 744 points in two days. Agriculture minister Sharad Pawar allayed fears of an impending food crisis in the event of a severe drought but accepted that prices of essential commodities were too high. He told the Lok Sabha that the country had enough buffer stocks of wheat and rice to survive for the next 13 months.         
	Cabinet secretary K.M. Chandrashekhar has called a meeting of state chief secretaries tomorrow to discuss the surge in prices and the drought in various regions.         
	Drought and floods in some areas have resulted in a 25 per cent less sowing of paddy. Agriculture ministry officials are hoping that late rains would see paddy sowing going up in August.         
	D.K. Joshi, principal economist at Crisil, the credit-rating agency, said that a drought could stir inflation and pull down production of foodgrain and overall economic growth.         
	Tushar Poddar, vice-president and chief economist at investment bank Goldman Sachs India, said in a report that the weak rainfall could reduce agricultural growth to -2 per cent year-on-year, down from an earlier estimate of 1.4 per cent.

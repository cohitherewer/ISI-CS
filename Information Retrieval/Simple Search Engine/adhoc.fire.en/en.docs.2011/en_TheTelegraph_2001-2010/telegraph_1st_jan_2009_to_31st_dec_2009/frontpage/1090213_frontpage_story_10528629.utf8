  Part of plot from our soil: Pakistan          NASIR JAFFRY                                                     
	Islamabad, Feb. 12: Pakistan today declared that part of the conspiracy behind the Mumbai terrorist attacks was hatched on its soil in the first-ever such acknowledgement that suggested diplomatic manoeuvres had started to bite.        
	The public announcement  stunning not so much for the content as for who was making it  was topped up with the disclosure of the detention of the alleged ring leader and five suspects.         
	Some part of the conspiracy has taken place in Pakistan, Rehman Malik, interior ministry adviser to the Prime Minister, told a news conference, detailing how the gunmen had sailed from Karachi to carry out the carnage between November 26 and 28. At least 173 people were killed, including around 30 foreigners.         
	An intriguing element was added late this evening when Mumbai police appeared to echo Pakistan for a brief while. The Mumbai police chief said the list of wanted included some Indians, only to retract the statement in a flip-flop usually associated with Pakistan.        
	 Malik said a case had been registered against nine persons, including Ajmal Kasab, the lone terrorist captured alive. Six suspects are in custody, he said, and two are known but still at large.         
	Malik, however, made it clear India had to do more and furnish credible evidence to make the charges stick in court. The findings were handed over to Indias high commissioner in Islamabad, Satyabrata Pal, along with a set of 30 questions Pakistan says it wants answered to help further investigation.        
	India termed Pakistans admission a positive development.        
	Reading out from the progress report of the Federal Investigation Agency, which carried out the probe, Malik said a case had been registered against the nine persons  who he reiterated were non-state actors  under laws dealing with terrorist activities and cyber crime. The FIR (01/2009) has been registered with a police station of the special investigation unit here.        
	He sprang a surprise by naming as the mastermind one Hamad Ameen Sadiq, 37, who was arrested from Karachi. Indian investigators professed ignorance about Sadiq and wondered why his name hadnt come up earlier.         
	India maintains the mastermind was the top brass of the Lashkar-e-Toiba, including Zaki-ur-Rehman Lakhvi and Zarar Shah. The Pakistan interior ministry chief said both had been located and are under investigation, but didnt clarify if they had been named in the FIR.         
	The others in custody are one Khan and one Riaz, whose full names Malik did not reveal. Also in custody are two controllers who were in charge of the Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP), Mohammed Ashfaq and Javed Iqbal who was based in Spain.        
	Malik said phone calls and bank transfers had led to the capture of Sadiq, who had emerged as the main operator. His interrogation led to the raid on two hideouts, one in Karachi and another two hours outside. They had some kind of training, they went into ocean, Malik said, adding the gunmen had sailed from Karachi.         
	The suspect identified as Khan purchased the engine that powered the rubber boat used by the attackers to travel from their trawler to the Mumbai shore. Khan also gave sleuths a phone number that helped them trace Sadiq, he said.        
	The terrorists used three boats. Malik named two  Al-Husseni, which capsized at sea, and Al-Fauz, a fishing trawler that was traced though it had been repainted and renamed Mashallah.         
	Iqbal, who was lured from Barcelona to Pakistan, allegedly made payments in Spain and Italy to acquire the VoIP phone numbers the attackers used to contact their handlers.         
	Malik tried to shift part of the onus on India by insinuating that the terrorists had been facilitated by local people. He said only nine of the 10 gunmen came ashore in the dinghy. India maintains all 10 had set sail from Karachi.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Iran releases scribe, Hillary heartened 
                                                                                                           Iran releases scribe, Hillary heartened 
                                Saberi: Islamic kindness                            
	Tehran, May 11 (Reuters): US-born journalist Roxana Saberi walked free today after an Iranian appeal court cut her eight-year jail sentence for spying to a suspended two-year term.        
	Her release resolved a case that had further strained US-Iranian relations, at a time when President Barack Obama is seeking to reach out to Tehran after three decades of mutual mistrust.         
	US secretary of state Hillary Clinton said Washington was heartened by the news, though it still objected to Saberis espionage conviction. She is currently with her family and will be leaving Tehran to return to the US in the coming days, Clinton said .        
	Saberi, a citizen of both the US and Iran who moved to Iran six years ago, was arrested in January for working in the Islamic Republic after her press credentials had expired. She was later accused of espionage. The 32-year-old freelance journalist was released from Tehrans Evin jail, where rights groups say political prisoners are usually held, one day after a closed appeal court hearing.        
	Foreign minister Manouchehr Mottaki had said her sentence would be reviewed on the basis of human and Islamic kindness.        
	Im very satisfied and happy about the ruling. We expected her to be freed but not this soon, said her father Reza, 68, who moved to the US in the early 1970s.        
	Roxana is well and is staying at a relatives home tonight... The exact date of our departure is not clear but we should get ready for our trip to America, he said.        
	One of Saberis defence lawyers, Saleh Nikbakht, told the Isna news agency the court had acquitted her of spying but convicted her under a law covering offences including taking pictures or videos in areas where photography is banned.        
	She will be banned from doing any reporting work in Iran for five years, said her main lawyer, Abdolsamad Khorramshahi. Judiciary spokesman Alireza Jamshidi told state television that Saberi, who has worked for the BBC and US National Public Radio, had confessed and apologised. So the court reduced the sentence ... since it was her first offence.

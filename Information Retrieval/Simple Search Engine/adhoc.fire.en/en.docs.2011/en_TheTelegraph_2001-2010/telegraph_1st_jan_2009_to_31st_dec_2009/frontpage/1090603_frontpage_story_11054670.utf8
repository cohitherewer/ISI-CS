The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | BJP picks Munda
                                                                                                           BJP picks Munda
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                             Munda                                  
	New Delhi, June 2: The BJP parliamentary board today nominated Karia Munda as the deputy Speaker of the Lok Sabha.        
	Munda, a six-time Lok Sabha MP and two-time Union minister, was preferred over other contenders because he was a tribal and Jharkhand, his native state, would go to the polls in the near future.        
	Mundas seniority and close links with the RSS also helped. He had become a central minister as early as 1977, in the Morarji Desai government. But his dream of becoming Jharkhand chief minister hasnt been fulfilled despite the fact that the BJP formed the government in the state twice. Munda had been a member of the Assemblies in undivided Bihar as well as in Jharkhand.        
	BJP leaders argued that a high post was long overdue for Munda. But the fact is that he has been propelled into this situation by accident.        
	Had the Congress not beaten the BJP in playing the gender card and fielded Meira Kumar as Speaker, Munda would have remained a backbencher. The BJP had originally planned to nominate Sumitra Mahajan for the deputy Speakers post.        
	The BJP leadership is still undecided about its leader in the Rajya Sabha, which meets from Thursday. Sources said Venkaiah Naidu had almost been cleared for the post after Arun Jaitley indicated he was not interested. But senior leaders are now giving a different impression, saying Jaitley was very much interested and in contention.

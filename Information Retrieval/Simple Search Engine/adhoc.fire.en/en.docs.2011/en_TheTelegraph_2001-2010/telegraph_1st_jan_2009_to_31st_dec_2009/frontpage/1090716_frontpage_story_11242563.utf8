          SUMAN K. SHRIVASTAVA                              
	Ranchi, July 15: A fresh spell of rainfall has improved the situation in the state despite its four districts being declared drought-hit.        
	The state agriculture department today allayed fears of farmers, saying there was no need to panic if the present condition prevailed. Agriculture secretary A.P. Singh said: We dont see much problem if rainfall continues. The state has received 120mm against the average of 320mm in July so far. So, the overall situation is not that bad.         
	He said sowing had gained momentum. The rain was disappointing in June, when the state received only 25 per cent of the normal rainfall, around 50-55mm. June happens to be the crucial season when farmers go for preparing seedlings, Singh said.        
	The Met department has predicted heavy rain in the state. Jharkhand is likely to see more rainfall in the next 48 hours, said Animesh Chanda, the director of Patna Met office.        
	Union minister of state for agriculture K.V. Thomas had told the Lok Sabha yesterday that Jharkhand had declared four districts  Palamau, Garhwa, Latehar and Chatra  as drought-hit, adding that the state should announce a drought emergency taking into account various factors, like rainfall deficiency and the status of sowing operations.        
	Declaring drought brings relief operation, waiver of agriculture loans and special attention over implementation of various welfare schemes on a war footing.        
	Significantly, the four districts have received more rain than those in Santhal Paragana and Lohardaga (65mm), Giridih (81mm) and Dhanbad (84mm) in July against the average of 320mm. Jamtara has received a scanty rainfall of 76mm, Deoghar 73mm, Dumka 67.4mm and Godda 67mm.        
	On the other hand, Palamau has received 112mm, Garhwa 143mm, Latehar 88mm and Chatra 120mm of rainfalls in July. A few districts, including Ranchi (167mm), Simdega (207mm), West Singhbhum (196mm), East Singhbhum (143mm) and Seraikela-Kharsawan (211mm) have received good rain in July, he added.        
	Singh argued that there were no strict guidelines to declare a region drought-hit. There was little rain in Palamau after August 20 last year, though there was good rain in June and July. So, the crops were damaged last year. This aggravated the situation further this year in Palamau when there was little rain in June, he said.        
	The delay in the arrival of monsoon resulted in 40 per cent damage of paddy in upland. Now, the farmers can go for pulses and oil seeds to compensate the losses, he added.         
	The governor has already issued directives to give seeds and other necessary facilities to farmers in the four districts. Besides, the crop insurance premium amount will be borne by the state.              
	 in these districts. The deputy commissioners have been asked to stress on steps to check migration, quality of drinking water and adequate power supply for irrigation.

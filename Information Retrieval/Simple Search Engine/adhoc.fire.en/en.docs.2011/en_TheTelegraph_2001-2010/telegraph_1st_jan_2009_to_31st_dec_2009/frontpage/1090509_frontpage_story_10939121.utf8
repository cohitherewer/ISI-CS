The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Varun NSA snub to Mayavati
                                                                                                           Varun NSA snub to Mayavati
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                            Varun                                
	Lucknow, May 8: The Mayavati governments imposition of the National Security Act against Varun Gandhi was unwarranted and legally not tenable, the advisory board authorised to examine its legality has said.        
	The advisory board has invalidated the recommendation for NSA against Varun Gandhi, Javed Ahmad, the special secretary of the home department, confirmed.        
	The report was submitted to the government two days ago. Three high court judges  one sitting and two retired  make up the NSA advisory board, which was set up in 2003 and enjoys the status of a high court division bench.         
	Soon after the report was leaked to the media in Lucknow this evening, senior government officials went into a huddle. A meeting, headed by the chief secretary, was held to decide the next move. Chief minister Mayavati, who returned from campaign meetings in the evening, also took stock of the situation.         
	The state government is considering making an appeal before the Supreme Court against the advisory boards recommendation, additional cabinet secretary Vijay Shankar Pandey said later.         
	The advisory board has cited two grounds for its recommendation. No case that warrants invocation of NSA against Varun Gandhi has been made out, its report said. The evidence on record against Varun Gandhi is unsatisfactory, it added.         
	Virendra Bhatia, a former advocate-general, said the recommendation of the board was binding on the state government.         
	But with polling due next week in Pilibhit, where Mayavati campaigned against Varun yesterday, the BSP government does not want to revoke the NSA immediately and lose face. An appeal in the Supreme Court will at least buy it some time.        
	Government sources tried to justify the plan saying the matter was already pending before the Supreme Court, which had granted bail to Varun, so there was no illegality in approaching it.        
	Varun, out on parole after spending nearly three weeks in jail, did not react immediately. But BJP supporters burst into celebration in Pilibhit and party vice-president Kalraj Mishra said it was a moral victory for the 29-year-old.        
	The NSA was invoked against Varun on March 29 because of rioting by his supporters the previous day when he went to surrender in court after being charged with making communal speeches.        
	Varun had appeared before the advisory board on April 28 and said the NSA was slapped against him out of political vendetta. Justices Pradeep Kant, P.K. Sarin and S.N. Sahay make up the board, which was set up by the previous Mulayam Singh Yadav government.

	Calcutta/Ranchi/Jamshedpur, Aug. 7: Jharkhands first swine flu patient, Jamshedpur boy Gopal Tiwary, was today traced to a Calcutta hotel near the citys international airport, forcing the Jharkhand health secretary to finally admit that the state administration hadnt been able to locate his whereabouts till late last night.        
	We got in touch with his mother, Pushpa Tiwary, who is a doctor, and she told us he was in a Dum Dum hotel, said Bhaskar Bhattacharya, the joint director, public health in Bengal.        
	The official claimed the boy, who started taking his medication (oseltamivir) from August 3, had completed his dose today and hence he was no more a threat to anyone who came in contact with him.        
	Technically, he is no more a swine flu patient and he need not be quarantined. His mother has requested us to inform the Jharkhand administration and help him get a fitness certificate as he has to fly abroad, said Bhattacharya.        
	Pushpa, who is understood to have reached Calcutta today to join her son, had also started a course of oseltamivir, possibly as a precaution.        
	Ever since Tiwary tested positive for swine flu and fled Jamshedpur on Wednesday night, Jharkhands health officials have been issuing contradictory claims regarding his whereabouts.         
	While the East Singhbhum health officials, including civil surgeon Deepali Dey, maintained throughout Thursday the boy had gone to Calcutta, state health authorities, led by health secretary Shivendu, claimed he had been shifted to a safe house.        
	Today, Shivendu admitted that the Jharkhand administration had lost track of Tiwary for quite sometime yesterday, forcing them to issue a lookout notice across the country. The lookout notice has now been withdrawn, Shivendu said, refusing to divulge where he was.         
	People of the state (Jharkhand) need not panic as he has been kept in an undisclosed, but safe location, considering the highly contagious nature of the virus, he added.                                            
	However, the health secretary concurred with the Bengal government official and agreed that Tiwary was recovering, and he was now no longer a threat.         
	Yesterday, he had no fever. Its the same today. Symptoms of swine flu are disappearing fast. We will be able to give him a certificate saying he was fit to travel anywhere inside the country and abroad soon, Shivendu said.        
	He said the patient would not be required to take any further tests since the symptoms were no longer prevalent. We will not carry out any more tests to confirm that the boy is OK. We are following the Centres protocol that clarifies that if symptoms go away, it means the person has recuperated, Shivendu added.         
	In Ranchi, senior health department officials disclosed that orders had been issued to the Mahatma Gandhi Medical College and Hospital in Jamshedpur and Pataliputra Medical College in Dhanbad to prepare isolation wards in case of exigencies.         
	Rajendra Institute of Medical Sciences (RIMS) in Ranchi has already set up its isolation ward.

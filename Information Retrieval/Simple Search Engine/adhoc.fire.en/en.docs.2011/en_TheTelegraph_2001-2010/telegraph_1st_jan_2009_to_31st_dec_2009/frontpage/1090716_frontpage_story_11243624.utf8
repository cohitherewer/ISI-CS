The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Hospital vandals face bill
                                                                                                           Hospital vandals face bill
  - Law to extract damages   from offenders        A STAFF REPORTER                                                          
	Calcutta, July 15: If you damage hospital property, youll have to pay up.        
	A person found guilty of vandalising medical property  a common occurrence in Bengal where patients relatives complain of negligence and indulge in violence  will be made to pay compensation under a bill passed by the Assembly today.        
	The offender will also be jailed for up to three years and will have to pay a fine of up to Rs 50,000.        
	Penal provisions of up to 10-year imprisonment already exist under different laws, although the prevailing fine is not more than Rs 1,000. But compensation is a new feature, added apparently on the request of medical establishments.        
	The size of the compensation will be decided by courts. If a person fails to pay up, his or her property will be attached to recover the amount.        
	Till now, most sections of the Indian Penal Code under which an offender is booked for such crimes are bailable. However, the new law, which will come into effect once a gazette notification is issued after the governor gives his nod, makes them non-bailable offences.        
	The bill states that the provisions of the IPC, too, can be applied concurrently against an offender.        
	Moving the bill, health minister Surjya Kanta Mishra said Bengal was the eighth state in the country to introduce such a legislation.         
	Asked whether the law will be implemented in a state known for wanton destruction of public property in the name of bandhs and little action thereafter, officials said the main purpose of the medical law was to act as a deterrent.        
	The new law will achieve two things, health secretary Samar Ghosh said. First, it will act as a deterrent since the fine is high and the payment of compensation has been worked in. Second, action can be taken expeditiously since this is a specific law against a specific crime.         
	The medical community welcomed the move. We have been clamouring for this law for the past two years, said R.D. Dubey, all-India senior vice-president of the Indian Medical Association. It has already been introduced in many other states and it has worked as a deterrent there.        
	Mishra said patients and their families had several avenues of redress to pursue complaints of medical negligence.         
	He listed consumer courts and councils, and officials said complaints could be filed with police, too. If an expert committee upholds the complaint, the police can arrest the doctor.        
	However, few doctors have actually been punished, largely because of delay in proceedings and the chain of appeals a conviction by consumer courts triggers.

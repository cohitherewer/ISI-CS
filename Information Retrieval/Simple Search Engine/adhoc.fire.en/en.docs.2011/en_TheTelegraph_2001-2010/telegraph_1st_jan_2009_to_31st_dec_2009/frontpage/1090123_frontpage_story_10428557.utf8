The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Razi meets Prez with adviser wish list
                                                                                                           Razi meets Prez with adviser wish list
          SUMAN K. SHRIVASTAVA                            Governor Syed Sibtey Razi meets President Pratibha Patil in New Delhi                                  
	Ranchi, Jan. 22: Jharkhand appeared to be heading for a long stint of Presidents rule with Governor Syed Sibtey Razi meeting President Pratibha Patil, Congress chief Sonia Gandhi and home minister P. Chidambaram to discuss the future of the state.        
	His first port of call was the President whom he met yesterday soon after his arrival in New Delhi. Today, he met Chidambaram and Sonia, said a Raj Bhavan spokesperson.         
	According to him, the governor apprised them of the political scenario in the state.        
	Sources said that the governor apparently discussed with Patil the appointment of central advisers for the period when the state will be under Presidents rule.         
	Razi also recommended to the home ministry and the Prime Minister the names of P.P. Sharma, Sunil Basant and R.R. Prasad as his advisers, the sources added.        
	Usually, advisers are often drafted from out of the state. It means that those who are not from Jharkhand cadre of IAS and IPS, would be appointed his advisers. However, the governor may make some exceptions. No wonder, several retired IAS and IPS officers from Jharkhand cadre too are said to be in the race. They include former chief secretaries V.S. Dubey, G. Krishnan and Sharma, retired IAS officer Basant and former director-generals of police T.P. Sinha, K.A. Jacob (Bihar cadre) and Prasad.        
	Meanwhile, the delay in the appointment of advisers to the governor is being attributed to the fact that the UPA leaders have not yet lost hope on forming an alternative government in the state.        
	There is also speculation that Razi could be replaced in case the Assembly is dissolved and put under a long stint of Presidents rule.         
	Central rule was promulgated in Jharkhand on January 19, with the Assembly kept under suspended animation.        
	State Congress chief Pradip Kumar Balmuchu admitted that a section of party workers had already expressed their reservations against Razi before the party high command.         
	The governor also told reporters in Delhi that the government could still be formed if a valid proposal came for his consideration.        
	According to a senior IAS officer, the informal political affiliations of the officers, too, would be considered at the time of appointment. If in-service state cadre officers are appointed, the governor would certainly keep away those considered close to the NDA government, he added.

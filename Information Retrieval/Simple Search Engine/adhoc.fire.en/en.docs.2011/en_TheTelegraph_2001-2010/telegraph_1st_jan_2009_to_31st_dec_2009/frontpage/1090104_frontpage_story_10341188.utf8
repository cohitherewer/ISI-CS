          OUR BUREAU                              
	Kanpur/Hyderabad, Jan. 3: A postgraduate student of IIT Kanpur killed himself in his hostel room after brooding for several days that campus recruiters had not hired him during a recent drive.        
	Ganga Pattanam Suman, who was doing his MTech in electrical engineering, was found hanging from a ceiling fan around 2.30 this afternoon, institute director Sanjay Govind Dhande told reporters.        
	Dhande said Suman, a native of Andhra Pradesh, had been depressed ever since he failed to get a job offer after an interview he had appeared for a couple of weeks back.        
	Even after studying so much, we are not able to get a job, he would tell his friends, Dhande said, adding that Suman would lock himself in his hostel room and rarely meet anyone.        
	Batchmates said Suman had been feeling unwell last night. But when he did not come to the mess for breakfast and lunch today, his friends went to his room, which was locked from inside, Dhande said. They broke open the door to see him hanging from the fan.        
	The director said Suman was taken to a hospital where he was declared dead.        
	The 24-year-old came from a backward class family of six  parents, two sisters and two brothers  in Koverapalem, a village in Andhras Nellore district. He had studied in a government college at Nellore and passed with distinction.        
	IIT sources said his aged parents had been informed and were expected to reach the Uttar Pradesh institute soon.        
	Kanpur IIT sources said Sumans father, G. Bhaskariyya, told Dhande over phone his son sounded upset over the placement interview when he last spoke to the family. But we had no idea he was contemplating this extreme step, the father said.         
	Institute deputy director Kripa Shankar said the electrical engineering student, who generally kept to himself, had told his friends he was depressed because of the recession-hit job scenario.        
	Some teachers at the institute, who did not want to be named, said this was probably the first time an IIT student had committed suicide after failing to get a job.        
	Ravi Shankaram, a batchmate, said Suman had been inconsolable the past two days and had talked of nothing else but his failure to get a job and how much he needed one.        
	Dhande said a committee of professors has been set up to probe the incident.

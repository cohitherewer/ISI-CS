The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | 5 Cobra men found dead
                                                                                                           5 Cobra men found dead
          SHEENA K.                              
	Raipur, Sept. 19: The Commando Battalion for Resolute Action (Cobra) suffered its first biggest casualty after security personnel recovered the bodies of five of its missing men today, days after the elite force sneaked into a Maoist den in Dantewada district and destroyed an arms factory, besides killing as many as 24 rebels.        
	Operation Green Hunt, on for the last 48 hours, has so far claimed six Cobra men, including assistant commandant Manoranjan Singh whose body was recovered yesterday.         
	After a massive search operation, security personnel spotted the bodies of five missing Cobra men in the dense forests of Palachalam, inspector-general of police (headquarters) R. K. Vij told The Telegraph.         
	Among those killed were assistant commandant Rakesh Chaurasia, sub-inspector, a head constable and two constables.         
	With the death of six of its men in Operation Green Hunt, this would be first time that the CRPFs Cobra had suffered casualties while combing the forests of Chhattisgarh ever since the special unit was raised in August last year to fight Maoist guerrillas.        
	Besides moving ground troops to look for the missing men, the state had planned to deploy an Indian Air Force (IAF) helicopter to conduct the search operation. But, the troops traced the bodies before the chopper could be air borne.        
	Along with the state police, the Cobra men had launched a major offensive against Maoists by storming their den in Palachalam forests, about 600km from here, under Kisteram police station of Dantewada district. In the operation that was launched on Thursday, at least 24 Maoists were gunned down by the security personnel. The police have recovered 10 bodies so far. An arms factory being run by the rebels was also destroyed.         
	Senior police officers said rebel casualty figures could be more as the security forces had planned the massive operation targeting the camp well in advance.         
	The rebels may have carried away the bodies of some their top cadre while fleeing, they added.

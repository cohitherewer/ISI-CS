The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | 26/11 oils wheels of arms bazaar
                                                                                                           26/11 oils wheels of arms bazaar
          SUJAN DUTTA                               
	Bangalore, Feb. 11: The November attack in Mumbai has turned into a unique selling proposition for global arms majors to sell more to India, and, for India, to justify ever-increasing expenses on guns, bombs, aircraft, fences, radars and spyware.         
	In an arms-bazaar-like Aero India 2009, the military aviation exhibition that was opened by defence minister A.K. Antony here today, 26/11 was invoked in every discussion  between businesspersons and government officials, among businesspersons of Indian and foreign firms and inter-governmental meetings  to expand the market, to sell more and, for India, to buy more.         
	The 26/11 strike has created demands that did not exist before and at the Yelahanka air force base, where Aero India is being held, every firm, big and small, global and local, is citing it to hawk its wares.         
	For aviation companies like Lockheed and Boeing and EADS and Dassault, homeland security system makers like Lumenera Corporation that sell surveillance cameras to malls and for border fencing firms, 26/11 is the biggest reason to urge India to invest more in military and protection equipment.         
	In 2008-09, Indias defence budget crossed Rs 1 lakh crore for the first time, three times more than the expenditure on health and education.         
	A jittery India is responding with nervousness after the successive terror strikes last year. It has decided to fast-track procurement of essential military equipment.        
	Today, Antony said the outlay for purchases would be hiked substantially in the next year. This would happen even though the ministry is likely to end the current financial year without being able to spend a portion of the Rs 35,000-crore allocated for new purchases in 2008-09.         
	It is not only the Mumbai attacks, said Antony, justifying the eagerness to hike military expenditure. If you look at the security scenario in our neighbourhood, anybody will tell you that we should be prepared at all times.         
	The defence establishment under Antony is contending with a hawkish view from the Right that Indias response to the terror attacks was limp because its armed forces were ill equipped.        
	Asked if he felt satisfied with Indias military response, he replied: I do not know what you mean by that. My response is that restraint should not be taken as a sign of weakness.         
	The Mumbai attacks figured in discussions between Antony and the visiting French minister of state for defence, Jean-Marie Bockel, this afternoon.         
	France is selling Scorpene submarines to Indias navy and Agosta submarines to the Pakistan navy. Bockel ducked a question on whether France would cease military supplies to Pakistan till Islamabad curbs terrorism that India alleges was sponsored by it.         
	This is a major concern in New Delhi, but big foreign arms suppliers have not really addressed it. The US is Pakistans biggest arms supplier. It supplies to Pakistan, for instance, a version of the F-16 Fighting Falcon made by Lockheed Martin. Another later version of the same aircraft is competing for a $12.5-billion-plus Indian Air Force order.         
	For better or worse, 26/11 is generating business that is potentially worth hundreds of billions of dollars and, as of now, Indias nervous shopping means that long-term worries are fading into the background.         
	Antony has also suggested, to the delight of the arms bazaar, that for New Delhi, the business is recession-proof.

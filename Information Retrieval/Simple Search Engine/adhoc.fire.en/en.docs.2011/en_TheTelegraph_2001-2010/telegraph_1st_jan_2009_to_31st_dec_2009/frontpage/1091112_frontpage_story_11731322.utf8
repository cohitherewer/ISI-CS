	New Delhi, Nov. 11: A Supreme Court bench will decide if judges can frame laws.        
	A two-judge bench has said a larger bench should go into the question whether courts can take over the work of Parliament and create laws to address pressing social problems.        
	Courts can fill gaps where a law exists. But can courts create laws when there isnt any? Is it permissible? If its permissible what are its limits? Justices Markandey Katju and Asok Kumar Ganguly asked as they cast doubts on a 2006 directive of the court on reforming college elections.        
	The judges said there were thousands and thousands of pressing problems. Should the judiciary deal with them all? Prices are rising and so is unemployment. Of course, we are concerned, but should we step in to deal with them? We dont have the knowledge or the expertise to do so.         
	Former law minister Shanti Bhushan said courts couldnt and shouldnt make laws and parliamentary delay in enacting laws couldnt be an excuse.         
	There is a concept of separation of powers. Courts should not encroach into the domain of the legislature and the executive. Courts can only point out what laws contravene the Constitution or suggest on what lines a law can be framed, he said.         
	Courts are now not deciding cases for over 20 years. Does it mean the legislature and executive should intervene and say: list the cases before us, we will decide?         
	The courts observations came as the bench questioned the 2006 directive that has helped curb the influence of money and muscle power in campus polls.        
	Although some institutions like the Jawaharlal Nehru University have refused to fall in line, the orders will stay till a larger bench decides otherwise.        
	Indian courts, like courts the world over, have laid down guidelines in the absence of statutory provisions to deal with specific problems.         
	In a 1997 judgment, the apex court set guidelines on ways to tackle sexual harassment at workplaces. The court said the guidelines would be in force till Parliament passed a law. But till now, the House hasnt.        
	In another recent instance, the court fixed guidelines to make registration of marriages compulsory.        
	Justices Katju, a known votary of judicial restraint, and Ganguly said even if courts step in to deal with an urgent social issue, their orders should be based on wide consultations and should not be in the nature of a diktat.        
	Courts should also forward their guidelines to Parliament or the appropriate executive authority, the bench said before referring the issue to the chief justice to decide whether the matter would be heard by a three-judge or a Constitution bench.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                            Mayavati                                  
	Lucknow, April 8: Mayavati today said the Election Commission would be held responsible if terrorists or Maoists carried out attacks in Uttar Pradesh, a day after the panel transferred the states principal secretary (home) on Opposition complaints.        
	As if that wasnt enough, the chief minister went a step further by appointing the bureaucrat, Fateh Bahadur Singh, to another important post  her principal secretary.        
	Merely because of allegations of a party, no officer should be shifted. This will be a blow to their confidence. Such actions may lead to law-and-order problems. The commission will be responsible if there is any terrorist or Naxalite-related violence, she said.        
	Naxalites are active in the areas around Chandauli, along the Jharkhand border.        
	Singh was shifted yesterday following complaints from the Samajwadi Party, which said the officer was getting party workers arrested in old cases during pre-election swoops. The BJP has also levelled similar allegations.        
	The states chief electoral officer, A.K. Bishnoi, appeared to shrug off the chief ministers comment and asserted that the poll panel had the power to transfer any officer once the model code of conduct came into force.        
	The commission is always responsible for whatever action it takes, Bishnoi said.        
	Mayavati said her officers had been following poll-related directives sincerely, as were leaders of her Bahujan Samaj Party. It is my explicit and stern directive to party candidates, office-bearers and workers that they should abide by the model code of conduct.        
	But though they have been following the rules, Mayavati said, several officers, including district magistrates and district police chiefs, had been removed by the commission merely on allegations made by Opposition parties. No proper investigation was carried out, she said.        
	Mayavati said the poll panel should draw the governments attention to officers not performing their duties properly. Any action, she suggested, should be joint.        
	The chief minister also claimed that the panel had broken tradition by not asking for a shortlist from the state government before appointing DMs and district police chiefs. Bishnoi said such appointments could be made without seeking a panel of names.

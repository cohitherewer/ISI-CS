The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | CPM mulls fixed term for satraps, not Karat
                                                                                                           CPM mulls fixed term for satraps, not Karat
          JAYANTH JACOB                               
	New Delhi, Oct. 25: The CPM has begun discussions on fixing the tenures of organisational secretaries from the lowest rung to at least till the state committee, a proposal that may necessitate some tweaking to the saying a communist never retires.        
	The exercise has not yet touched upon the question whether the top post of general secretary, now held by Prakash Karat, should also be covered by the proposed fixed-term rule, sources said.        
	Asked about a fixed term for the general secretary, Karat today gave an enigmatic reply: I wish it was.        
	The tenures of secretaries of committees at the levels of branch, local, area or zonal, district and state was discussed by the CPM central committee over the weekend. The scope of the talks means the term of the CPMs state chiefs could also be restricted.        
	So far, the BJP is the only mainstream party in the country that has imposed a ceiling on the number of years a person can be at the helm without break. The BJP has set a three-year term, after which the incumbent will have to take a break before running for party president again.        
	The CPMs fixed-term proposal is expected to be discussed threadbare at the 20th party congress in 2011.         
	The plan to limit tenures is not part of the rectification campaign triggered by the Lok Sabha poll debacle. But a perception that the guarantee of a limitless innings has made several leaders static has prompted the party to think of imposing a ceiling.         
	At least one central committee member, based in Delhi, proposed that the rule should be extended to cover members ranging from the politburo to the branch committee, not just the secretaries, but it did not find wider acceptance, the sources said. The central committee member suggested a restriction of three terms.        
	If a three-term restriction is eventually accepted, the secretaries of the committees can be at the helm for nine years as the party congress meets every three years since 1982  a duration that has come to be accepted as one term.        
	State conferences ahead of a party congress elect the state committee, which in turn picks the state secretariat and the state secretary. The same process repeats itself down the ladder to the branch, the lowest rung.        
	At a media conference today, Karat, who has been at the helm since 2005, did not reveal much about the proposal to fix the term of office-bearers. Its not a rectification issue, he said, referring to the main issue on the agenda of the three-day central committee meeting.        
	If the tenure proposal is approved by the party congress, some comrades will have to officially retire as secretaries, though they can continue to be members.        
	But the sources said the weekend discussions also gave the impression that exceptions could be made in the rarest of rare cases.

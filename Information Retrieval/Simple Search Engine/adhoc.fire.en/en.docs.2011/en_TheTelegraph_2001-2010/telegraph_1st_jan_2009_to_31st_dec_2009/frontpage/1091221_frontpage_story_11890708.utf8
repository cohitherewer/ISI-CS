          J. FREEDOM DU LAC                       Bulge battle                          
	Washington, Dec. 20: In this season of Christmas cookies, an unlikely figure is leading the offensive against the obesity epidemic.         
	The beard on his double chin is as white as snow, and when he laughs, his little round belly shakes like a bowlful of jelly  and that, as Ernest Berger sees it, is the problem.        
	Berger is a Santa Claus. But as president of the volunteer group Santa America, Berger has been nudging some of his more corpulent colleagues towards a different model of Santa. He wants his fellow members of the Claus family to give themselves the gift of less girth, calling it a matter of self-preservation that will also help children to whom Santa is a roly-poly role model.        
	Im pushing to reduce the size of Santa by 25 per cent, Berger says from his home in Daphne, Alabama. Were gently and relentlessly focused on getting these men to be positive about fitness.        
	This battle of the bulge has been raging quietly within the Santa community, which is made up of an estimated 4,000 professional Santas.        
	In some Santa circles  typically, the ones with the largest circumferences  the idea that Santa Claus should consider swapping sugar cookies for carrot sticks is not popular. A half-dozen super-heavyweight Santas contacted for this story declined to comment.        
	Nicholas Trolli, president of the Amalgamated Order of Real Bearded Santas, says there was no shortage of blowback when he pushed for a slimmer Santa a while back. Some Santa lovers told me to shut up; like, who am I to decide what Santas weight should be? says Trolli, who is clinically obese at 5-foot-10, 270 pounds.        
	Berger estimates that one-third of professional Santas in the US are obese, roughly mirroring the prevalence of obesity among American adults. The rest of the Santas are fit, but you might not know it, since many wear padding under their big, red suits to create the illusion of a massive midsection. Berger wants to see Santa lose that fake fat, too, and get back to where he might actually fit in a chimney again.        
	Declaring a fatwa on excessive Santa fat is daring to tinker with a cherished American cultural icon that dates to the Great Depression, when Santa was drawn as a jolly fat man for a Coca-Cola commercial, his paunch intended to symbolise more prosperous times. Although Santa had been presented in varying sizes before then, Cokes ads made him permanently porcine, at least in American culture.

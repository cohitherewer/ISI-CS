The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Come home to PMs family
                                                                                                           Come home to PMs family
          RADHIKA RAMASESHAN                                  Gursharan Kaur, Upinder Singh, Daman Singh                                 
	New Delhi, April 21: Just when the country was getting used to an unknown face of Manmohan Singh, the curtains parted on another unfamiliar sight: his family on primetime television.        
	The Prime Ministers wife, Gursharan Kaur, and two of their daughters, Upinder Singh and Daman Singh, were beamed into living rooms by CNN-IBN tonight, adding another element to an unusual election season that saw the gentle professor transforming himself into a gladiator on the political arena.        
	Backroom boys in the Congress were quick to put a spin, saying that opinion within the party war room was that such an interview would be a hit with the middle class.        
	The Prime Ministers Office would not confirm how the interview came about. But a source associated with Singh till recently said when the interviewer approached him (the source) with the idea, he facilitated the interaction.        
	Our feedback was Singh connected with ordinary people because he came across as sincere, firm, mature and modest, said a source in the war room. So we thought, why not give the campaign a personal touch with the family in the frame? It will make the PM seem like a leader who is also an aam aadmi.        
	In the interview, the family did come across as one.         
	Gursharan complained, in mock exasperation and affectionate pride: Yup, its all work, work, work  work is his (Singhs) religion I just got used to the way he is.        
	Family holidays? Upinder, a history professor, had to think back three decades: In the 70s we all went to Nainital when we were small.        
	 Does he bring work home? Daman, homemaker and novelist, said even my son at 10-12 had come to know all about the nuclear deal but my mother has a rule: no talking work at the dining table.        
	The Congress is chuffed by the thought that the three articulate and individualistic women  the other daughter, Amrit, lives in the US  would raise Singhs stock before the middle class. They answered the questions like normal, intelligent women. No rhetoric, no cliches, a source said.        
	Gursharan, asked about the weak PM charge, quoted from a 70s Bollywood song: Kuch to log kahenge, logon ka kaam hai kehna (people will talk; its in their nature).

  - Nepal PM quits, seeks moral high ground by blaming India        J. HEMANTH                             Prachanda announces his resignation. (AFP)                                        
	Kathmandu, May 4: Prachanda, Nepals first Maoist Prime Minister, resigned today after indirectly blaming India and casting himself in the role of a martyr who refused to bow before foreign powers.        
	I will quit the government rather than remain in power by bowing down to the foreign elements and reactionary forces, Pushpa Kamal Dahal alias Prachanda said hours after President Ram Baran Yadav rendered the Prime Ministers position untenable by asking army chief Rukmangad Katuwal to ignore a sack order and continue in his post.        
	Simmering tensions reached a flashpoint when Prachanda sacked Katuwal yesterday after he refused to absorb former rebel units, now housed in UN-monitored camps, into army ranks.         
	Announcing his resignation over television, the 54-year-old Prachanda said his party was ready to maintain cordial relations with neighbouring countries but would not accept any intervention.         
	The comment is being seen as a reference to Indias advice to the Nepal government not to sack the army chief in haste  which Prachanda ignored and set in motion the chain of events that culminated in the political turmoil.        
	India fears that integration in haste will allow the Maoists to take full control of the Nepal army and raise the spectre of an unfriendly force along one more border.         
	New Delhi, which has put border guards on high alert, sought to play down the India hand by terming the developments in Nepal an internal matter but analysts said the Indian pressure on retaining the army boss had become too evident to too many to be denied.                
	If Prachanda did not name India, his finance minister Baburam Bhattarai was more blunt. The so-called democratic forces, specially headed by the so-called democrats in New Delhi, have been dictating (to) their patrons in Kathmandu to side with the army and fight against the democratic forces, he said.        
	That is why we have resigned in protest so that morally, we get the high ground to fight against the forces who are trying to restore monarchy and scuttle the new democratic republic in Nepal, Bhattarai added.        
	Asked if the Maoists would join a new government, he said: The so-called President, who is directly dictated (to) by New Delhi, has been sent messages to act against the elected government and has restored the sacked army chief. The President should (admit that it is an unconstitutional decision) and only then we can think of joining the government. Otherwise, we will go to the streets.        
	Soon after President Yadav accepted Prachandas resignation, the Maoist central committee announced protest programmes. A petition was filed in Nepals top court challenging the Presidents order reinstating the army chief.        
	Although Prachanda blamed foreign powers, his allies who jumped ship and the President who belongs to the Opposition Nepali Congress, he admitted that his eight-month-old government had failed to deliver on its promises.        
	The Communist Party (UML), which dumped the Maoists, and the Nepali Congress are exploring the possibility of forming a national government. UML chairman Jhala Nath Khanal said his party was ready to lead the next administration, adding that a national government with all parties, including the Maoists, should be formed.

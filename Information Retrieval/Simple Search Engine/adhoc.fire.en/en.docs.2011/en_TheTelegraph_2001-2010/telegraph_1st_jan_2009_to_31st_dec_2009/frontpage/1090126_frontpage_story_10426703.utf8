The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Grandads dream, now
                                                                                                           Grandads dream, now
										                                    
	Amid the nationwide din following the Mumbai terror attacks, India silently stepped closer than ever before to implementing a dream for the countrys progress articulated by some of the architects of our Constitution.        
	For a nation grappling with fundamental questions about its security in the immediate aftermath of the most audacious terrorist strikes on its soil, education was not top of the mind.        
	But a proposed legislation tabled in the Rajya Sabha after years in limbo has placed India on the verge of a prolonged surgery to cure a disease far older than AK-47s or grenades.        
	The Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education Bill, 2008, promises to address Indias embarrassing inability to ensure basic schooling for its children despite a 9 per cent GDP growth in recent times.        
	The bill will now have to be discussed either in the remainder of this Lok Sabha or in the next as it cannot lapse once tabled in the Upper House.        
	An ideal state, Plato had said in the 4th century BC, must provide basic education to all its citizens. Two millennia later, several of the founding fathers of Indias Constitution argued that the state must ensure education for all, the Constituent Assembly debates reveal.        
	It is essential for any Constitution which is drawn up to make all the citizens realise that their basic privileges  education, social and economic  are afforded to them, Sarvapalli Radhakrishnan had said, on December 11, 1946.        
	Algurai Shastri, an MP of the United Provinces on January 20, 1947, quoted the poet Kalidas to say: An ideal state, like a father, provides its people with protection, education and maintenance.        
	V.C. Kesava Rao, another member of the Constituent Assembly, on April 29, 1947, called education the birth right of every citizen.        
	But it took over five decades before a constitutional amendment in 2002 made elementary schooling a fundamental right.         
	Over the next six years, three drafts of the bill were discarded before they could be tabled in Parliament. The National Advisory Council under Sonia Gandhi at one stage remarked about Indias inability to fulfil a dream that should have been realised for the present generations grandfathers.        
	Once passed, the right to education act will form the template for fulfilling expectations that every Indian child can actually be sent to school and retained in school.        
	If implemented properly, the bill also promises to help India rid itself of the scourge of child labour. By ensuring children are in school, you ensure they are not at work, said Shantha Sinha, the chairperson of the National Commission for Protection of Child Rights.        
	If the law comes close to ensuring that every child is in school, it will help India address the concern that the countrys development is lopsided.        
	But equally, failure to rise above legislation that litter Indias legal library but are perceived to leave little impact could trigger fresh doubts about the focus of the countrys development model.        
	It will be really challenging to implement the right to education bill, once passed by Parliament. It will require a lot of effort from the government, said educationist Vinod Raina, one of the key drafters of the bill in conjunction with the human resource development ministry. But it is not impossible, he added.        
	Over the past decade and a half, India has significantly improved key primary education statistics. Gross enrolment rates have jumped from less than 80 per cent in the early 1990s to over 95 per cent at present, according to official figures.        
	Several critics have challenged these statistics, but independent studies by an NGO, Pratham, corroborate that the Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan, a drive to universalise primary education, has led to improved enrolment rates.        
	But in the absence of any penalties for failing to ensure children stay in class, Indias school retention rates lag behind enrolment figures at a dismal 70 per cent, even according to official figures.        
	The right to education bill for the first time hands parents and students a legal weapon with which to strike a state that chooses to ignore its responsibilities towards schooling. Once the bill becomes law, any parent could haul the government  central, state or both  to the courts for failing to ensure his child is in school.         
	That will be the real test for the bill. If in 10 years of implementation of the law, we have near-universal retention, it will be a success of the right to education, Raina said.        
	Under the proposed law, schools are barred from holding admission tests to select students, and cannot demand either birth certificates or transfer certificates as conditions for granting admission.        
	Each private school must reserve 25 per cent of its seats for students from economically weaker sections from the neighbourhood. The government will compensate private schools for providing free education  including books, uniform and essential stationery  to such students.        
	Parents and students will constitute a two-thirds majority in the school management committee that will have the responsibility of implementing the law in the school.        
	Schools will be barred from seeking capitation fees or mandatory donations  if found guilty, a school may have to pay up to 10 times the amount it sought as capitation fee or donation.         
	India will shift to a neighbourhood schooling system within three years of implementation of the law. Under this system, students seeking admission in government schools can only go to an institution in their neighbourhood  an area marked by distance from the students residence.        
	The distance used to demarcate the neighbourhood will vary from state to state  smaller distance in hilly areas, for instance.        
	Yet, the bill has its critics, too.        
	Several educationists have said the right to education legislation must ensure the right to education of largely uniform standards. This, they added, requires a common schooling system, as is followed in Britain.        
	Britain made primary education a fundamental right for boys in 1870 and later extended the right to girls. In the 1940s, the right was extended to secondary education.         
	In Britain, common schools are government-managed institutions where 93 per cent of primary and secondary school students study. The remaining seven per cent go to independent  private  institutions or take home schooling.        
	Starting a common schooling system in India today will require a ban on all private schools  a violation of the fundamental constitutional right to practise trade and enterprise  the government has said.        
	Some critics have argued that even after the law comes into force, students may have access to differential standards of education  depending on whether they go to a private school or to a government school.         
	But statistics over the past few years have repeatedly confirmed that Kendriya Vidyalayas  central government schools  are superior in most parameters, including academic performance, to the average private school.        
	Some critics of the bill feel that it must cater to students at the secondary education stage too  till the age of 18.         
	But proponents of the bill  in the government and outside  said that it would be foolish to lose out on the present opportunity to enact the law.

	2008 was a bad year for most of  us mdash; and the last quarter was  particularly distressing,
  especially for us techies, because of the global economic downturn.  
	 2009 unfortunately has not started off very well for our sector either mdash; just take a look at the Satyam mess.  Elections are round the corner. While my  expectations of the new government (incumbent or otherwise) aren rsquo;t very positive, we can expect the people in charge to provide a major boost in this direction as the economy seems to be topping everyone rsquo;s agenda.  
	 By the latter half of 2009, I am hoping to  see a certain level of normalcy for all sectors of industry, especially IT.  We lost out our ldquo;Singur rdquo; in 2008, but it will be wonderful if our state government manages to find another in 2009. More investments and more players, especially in the IT arena setting up bases in Sector V, giving us visibility
  and confidence, are what we need in the coming years.   
	 Our state needs this, the IT sector needs this mdash; and society as a whole will be the biggest gainer.  
	 To all you college  students whose campus placements have been withheld, to the fresh graduates who have not managed to crack job  interviews because of the ongoing ldquo;hiring freeze rdquo; and to all you young IT professionals enveloped by the dark gloomy ldquo;lay-off rdquo; spectre mdash; well, hold on tight! This bumpy plane ride is not over  yet mdash; but it will not last forever either.

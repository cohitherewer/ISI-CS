	London, Aug. 10 (PTI): Oscar-winning actress Penelope Cruz seems to have aroused sexual desire in the director of her new film, Broken Embraces, despite the fact that he is gay.         
	Pedro Almodovar, who is a homosexual and not generally interested in women, has confessed that he was intensely attracted to his muse despite his sexual orientation. Normally, as a director, you engage with your leading lady on an extremely emotional level, and there is everything but sex. But it is true that with Penelope it is different. She has caused me sexual desire, Almodovar said.         
	Out of all the actresses I have worked with, Penelope really has been the one who has caused a sense of desire in me beyond the sensuality of a film shoot, he added.         
	Meanwhile, it is rumoured that the 35-year-old actress is reportedly carrying her first child with boyfriend, actor Javier Bardem. Penelope is about four months pregnant. Shes really healthy now and will be a great mother, a source said. She attended the UK premiere of Broken Embraces in London wearing a red Bottega Veneta trouser suit, sparking speculations that she wore the high-waisted outfit to disguise her baby bump.

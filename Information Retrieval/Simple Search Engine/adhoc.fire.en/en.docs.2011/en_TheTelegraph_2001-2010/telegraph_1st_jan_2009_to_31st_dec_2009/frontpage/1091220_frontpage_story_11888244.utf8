          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Kohima, Dec. 19: The Naga peace process is poised to receive a boost with National Socialist Council of Nagalims general secretary Thuingaleng Muivah tentatively scheduled to visit New Delhi by mid-January to discuss the governments proposals to hammer out a solution.         
	Disclosing this today, kilonser (minister) in charge of the ministry of information and publicity, Vikiye Sumi cautioned that the visit would depend on the situation between now and then and the outcome of ongoing meetings between top NSCN (I-M) leaders and Indian officials in New Delhi. He did not divulge any details but added that the NSCN (I-M) would not accept any conditions.        
	The emissary to the collective leadership of the NSCN (I-M), V.S. Atem, is at present in New Delhi, meeting Indian leaders on the Centres proposals and doing the groundwork for Muivahs visit.         
	Sources said the outcome of the meetings with the central leaders would be communicated to Muivah who is reportedly somewhere in Europe.         
	Harping on the Centres sincerity, the NSCN (I-M) leader said a lot would depend on Delhis commitment and pragmatic approach to hammer out an honourable and acceptable solution to the imbroglio.         
	He added that Swu might not come even if Muivah did, but did not elaborate.         
	Sources, however, said according to the agreement between the Centre and the NSCN (I-M), talks are to be held at the prime ministerial level and Muivah is the ato kilonser (prime minister) of the Government of Peoples Republic of Nagalim (GPRN) while Swu is its president.         
	Sumi said even if they were to visit New Delhi first, all security aspects had to be worked out by the GPRN and the Centre. Security is also another problem for the leaders, the outfits spokesman said.         
	Though the Centre has prepared proposals for the Isak-Muivah faction, the Khaplang faction of the NSCN and the Naga National Council have jointly rejected any conditional proposal to hammer out a solution to the Naga issue.         
	Naga organisations and political parties have, however, urged the NSCN (I-M) and the Centre for an honourable and acceptable solution to the Naga imbroglio.         
	The Congress said as the Centre had shown its sincerity to resolve the Naga problem, the Nagas must take full advantage of the situation and come to a conclusion on a pending problem.         
	Nagaland PCC president K.V. Pusa said internal differences within Naga society should be sorted out so that joint talks could be held with the Centre.        
	Home minister Imkong L. Imchen said a logical conclusion to the Naga political problem should be a New Years gift to the Naga people.         
	I hope that with the dawn of the New Year many things will unfold for the Naga people, specially when the government of India is sincerely determined to bring and offer a meaningful and honourable solution to the Naga political issue which Naga people cannot afford to ignore, he said.         
	The Naga organisations have also urged the state government to defer elections to the municipal councils and town councils slated for February in view of the proposed meeting between the Centre and the NSCN (I-M).

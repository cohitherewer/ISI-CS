The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Pullout goes to politburo
                                                                                                           Pullout goes to politburo
  - Karat skirts criticism   by Bengal members         BISWAJIT ROY                                          
	Calcutta, June 12: Prakash Karat today avoided reacting to Bengal comrades criticism of the withdrawal of support to the UPA government, but Sitaram Yechury and Biman Bose made it clear the politburo and the central committee would discuss the issue.        
	Replying to the criticism at the end of a CPM state committee meeting on the poll debacle, Karat did not defend the withdrawal or the subsequent third front experiment. He confined himself to explaining the political background behind the moves and left it to the higher party forums to judge the decisions.        
	But the general secretary did not forget to remind detractors that both decisions had been ratified by the politburo and the central committee unanimously.        
	Karat continued to draw flak today with some leaders describing the support withdrawal as a serious departure from the directive of the partys Coimbatore congress.         
	Karats non-committal stand disappointed many participants. But the party, facing pressure from the Bengal unit, sought to address their concerns by saying the withdrawal issue would be discussed in Delhi from June 19 to 21.        
	Asked whether the committee members questioned the support withdrawal, CPM state secretary Biman Bose said: Our politburo and central committee will review the partys electoral tactics and the related issues. Thats why I am not mentioning the discussions we had on it.        
	Yechury, who was present along with fellow politburo member S.R. Pillai, said the decision on withdrawal would be discussed in the central committee as its an all-India issue.         
	The politburo was initially dismissive of any possible link between the withdrawal and the poll result.         
	Bose said the partys future relations with the Congress and the second UPA government would also be discussed by the central committee. Bose, like Yechury, is known to be against burning bridges with the Congress.        
	Although Karat admitted the failure of the third front, be insisted that a non-BJP, non-Congress alternative was still a political imperative. The Bengal committees media release, however, focused more on the peoples rejection of the third front as a credible alternative to the Congress to fight communal and terrorist forces.         
	But it was not Karats political line alone that came under fire. Many trained guns on the government led by Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee as well as the organisation headed by Bose.         
	A separate state committee meeting will be held to discuss ways to overcome the shortcomings of the government and the state party unit.        
	Karat, too, listed the state factors, including land acquisition that was seen as a major reason behind the huge erosion in the partys traditional peasant base.        
	He referred to the criticism of the governments poor performance in rural development and laid stress on regaining its pro-poor image by changing its priorities. The CPM chief felt that the government had failed to fathom the misgivings of Muslims.        
	Chief minister Bhattacharjee chose not to speak at the meeting, but Bose referred to multiple factors behind the electoral drubbing. The state secretary stressed the failure of the party, the government and local bodies to uphold the interests of the poor and the toiling. Non-communist lifestyle of a section of the party was also blamed.        
	In tune with the chief ministers new priorities before the Assembly polls, Bose stressed broad-basing BPL cards, tribal projects and rural electrification. Industrialisation was not mentioned.

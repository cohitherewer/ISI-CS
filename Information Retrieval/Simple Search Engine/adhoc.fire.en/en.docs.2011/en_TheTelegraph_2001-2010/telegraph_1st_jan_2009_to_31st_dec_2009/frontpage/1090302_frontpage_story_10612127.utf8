	March 1: A girl has been crowned Indian Idol for the first time in the nation-wide talent hunts four-year history.        
	Crowd favourite Sourabhee Debbarma, 23, of Agartala edged out Kapil Thapa of Dehra Dun in tonights final in Mumbai, while Torsha Sarkar of Asansol was second runner-up.        
	The petite Sourabhee has given Tripura a second pan-Indian star within two months of tennis player Somdev Dev Varman reaching the Chennai Open final.        
	I cant believe I have won. It feels like Im still at the rehearsals. I thank all of you for making a girl the Indian Idol and (hope to) continue to entertain you all, said the winner, who now has a Rs 1-crore contract with Sony TV.        
	Sourabhee, whose singing and dancing skills had earned her the sobriquet of Indian Shakira, performed Jai Ho with Kapil and a jig with John Abraham. Katrina Kaif and Neil Nitin Mukesh attended the final, as did Sourabhees father Sunil, a government official, and mother Arundhati.        
	Her victory will carry forward the legacy of music icons like Sachin Dev Burman and Rahul Dev Burman, said Sudipta Sekhar Mishra, a leading singer of Tripura.        
	Her Agartala neighbourhood of Krishna Nagar erupted in fireworks and street dancing. We were waiting for this day. Tonight will be a rocking night, said Raja Purkayastha of the Cosmopolitan Club.        
	Tripura royal Pradyut Kishore Dev Burman had taken to the streets urging people to vote for Sourabhee. She is the second woman to win a major talent hunt this year, after Mumbais Vaishali Made topped Zee Sa Re Ga Ma Pa in January.        
	Her victory continues the Northeasts fine run at talent shows, with Amit Paul of Shillong just pipped by Darjeelings Prashant Tamang in Indian Idol 3. Debojit Saha of Silchar, the trend-setter who won the Zee show in 2006, said: This is one more laurel for the Northeast. Its a double treat because she is a girl.

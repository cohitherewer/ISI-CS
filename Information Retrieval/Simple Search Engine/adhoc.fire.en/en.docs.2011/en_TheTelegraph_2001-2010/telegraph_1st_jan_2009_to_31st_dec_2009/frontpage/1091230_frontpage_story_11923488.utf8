The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | First sari for First Spouse
                                                                                                                                                 1                                                                                First sari for First Spouse
  - Feels like a nice kimono, says Bruni-beater Miyuki           ARCHIS MOHAN                             The sari-clad Miyuki Hatoyama in Mumbai on Sunday                                         
	New Delhi, Dec. 29: Miyuki Hatoyama draped a sari around herself for the first time in her life. It felt like wearing a nice kimono.        
	That was on Sunday, nearly seven years after Japans First Spouse had last visited India.        
	But the self-confessed lover of things Indian felt totally at ease  comfortable enough to wrap herself in the red sari.        
	It was like wearing a nice kimono, the Japan Prime Ministers wife told The Telegraph in an exclusive interview.        
	Veterans in the foreign service couldnt recall the wife of a visiting head of state of a major country wearing a sari to an official event.        
	A spokesperson for the ministry of external affairs said it was a rare and significant gesture.        
	Miyuki, a former actress, thought the sari she wore to the Mumbai event was heavy. But so it is with a kimono. The more gorgeous or exotic it is, the heavier it is, said the 62-year-old who ended her three-day visit to India with husband Yukio Hatoyama today.        
	Back home in Japan, Miyuki, who has authored several books, lends a dash of colour to the world of politics considered colourless in her country.        
	While the other First Ladies before her stayed away from the spotlight, Miyuki comes across as out of the world. In one of her books, she wrote how her soul rode on a triangular shaped UFO and went to Venus while her body slept.        
	Elsewhere, she has talked about getting energy from eating the sun, or that she knew Hollywood actor Tom Cruise in a different incarnation. He would recognise me when I see him and say Long time no see, she said on a Japanese television talk show.        
	In September, Time magazine rated her first on its list of ten most colourful first spouses of all time. Even ahead of Carla Bruni.        
	Indians missed out on a glimpse of the French Presidents wife when protocol stopped the former supermodel from accompanying husband Nicolas Sarkozy to last years Republic Day Parade. She hadnt become Mrs Sarkozy yet.        
	Carla missed, but Miyuki sizzled.        
	The Japanese First Lady spoke about a different energy she felt on her visit this time. I was in Mumbai seven years back. On my current visit, I could feel a different atmosphere. The energy covering India as a whole is different, she said.        
	Miyuki said Indias multifaceted culture fascinated her. I have always been interested in Indias songs, movies, dancing and its diverse culture, she said.         
	Her interest in spirituality was another reason she had been drawn to India, the pull strong enough to make her visit the country four times.        
	I have been to Kashmir, Mumbai, Delhi and Chennai, she said.        
	As for Carla, she has to wait to see the Taj. Her husband has promised to take her to India. Till then, she can practise how to wrap a sari around her.

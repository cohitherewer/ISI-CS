The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Border outposts for hell hills
                                                                                                           Border outposts for hell hills
          A STAFF REPORTER                               
	Guwahati, May 3: The deteriorating law and order situation in the North Cachar Hills district has prompted the authorities to revive the inter-state border outposts along Nagaland, Meghalaya and Manipur to check hit-and-run strikes by militants.         
	The 14 border outposts, of which 10 are in Nagaland and Manipur, were closed down in a phased manner by 1994 as the situation as the district was hardly the hell it is now, sources in Dispur said today.         
	The objective is to effectively guard the border to block entry and exit routes in North Cachar Hills and mount an all-out offensive against the rebels.         
	The district, spread over 4,890 square km in southern Assam, is surrounded by Nagaland and Manipur in the east, Cachar district in the south, Meghalaya and part of Karbi Anglong district in the west and part of Karbi Anglong and Nagaon in the north.         
	To revive the state-border guarding mechanism, the authorities plan to deploy at least one company or two platoons of well-equipped police personnel in each of the outposts given the spate of recent rebel attacks which have derailed the crucial East-West Corridor and gauge conversion projects.         
	The mixed population of North Cachar Hills  home to 18 communities, including Dimasas, Jeme Nagas, Hmars, Kukis and the Karbis  also makes it easy for rebels from outside to mingle easily with local residents.         
	The hilly district shares its boundary with the bordering areas of the three neighbouring states, serving as a kind transit for militants and mischief-makers. Nagaland is the most vulnerable of the three, as the Dima Halam Daogah (Jewel) shares links with the National Socialist Council of Nagalim (Isak-Muivah). Work is on to ensure the border is effectively guarded. The April 28 attack on a village by a suspected Naga outfit at Yia Basti in the Maibong subdivision only goes on to prove that trouble comes visiting the district from across the border, the source said.         
	Besides re-opening the border outposts, three additional companies of CRPF personnel are being moved to the district.        
	The police, army, BSF and CRPF personnel are also holding co-ordination meetings in Haflong at 4pm everyday.        
	The apex body of Dimasas, the Jadikhe Naisho Hoshom, and the All Dimasa Students Union, on the other hand, in a four-page memoradum to North Cachar Hills deputy commissioner S. Jagannathan today demanded a check on the gradually deteriorating law and order situation because of worsening ties between Dimasa and Naga communities by ensuring security in villages of both communities.

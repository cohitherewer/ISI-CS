	London, July 31 (AP): Queen Elizabeth II has switched bearskin hats for turbans outside Buckingham Palace, where Sikh soldiers have begun guarding the monarch and her treasures, Britains defence ministry said today.        
	Signaller Simranjit Singh and Lance Corporal Sarvjit Singh are the first Sikhs to take part in patrols outside the Queens residence and to stand watch over the Crown jewels at the Tower of London across town.        
	Guard duties are usually carried out by the Guards of Household Division, famed for their bearskin hats and crimson coats that attract picture-taking tourists. The ministry said the Sikh soldiers instead wore turbans and blue uniforms. It added that the two soldiers are the first of the 90 Sikhs in Britains army to be handed the task. Sarvjit Singh, who was born in India and is a member of 3 Regiment Army Air Corps, said he was thrilled to have had the opportunity to guard the queen. My experience of being a Sikh on the Queens guard is beyond words, said the 28-year-old.

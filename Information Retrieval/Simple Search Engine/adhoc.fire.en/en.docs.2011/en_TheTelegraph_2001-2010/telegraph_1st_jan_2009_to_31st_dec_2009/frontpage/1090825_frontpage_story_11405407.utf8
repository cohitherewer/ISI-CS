          OUR BUREAU                            Gaffars house and the gate on the premises that opens into Vedic Village. (Soumen Bhattacharjee, Sanat Kumar Sinha)                                 
	Calcutta, Aug. 24: Gaffar Mollah, the man at the centre of the Vedic Village flare-up, started out as a van-rickshaw driver but struck it rich by facilitating land deals for realtors keen to ride the property boom in North 24-Parganas.        
	The birth of the luxury resort in the late nineties marked a turning point in Gaffars transition from driving a van-rickshaw  and later a lorry  to steering far more rewarding deals in real estate.        
	As police hunted for him on Monday, Chandpur Champagachi village was abuzz with stories about how the 38-year-old had raised a 150-strong mastan bahini (army of toughs) to arm-twist property owners and occupants who were reluctant to sell.        
	Vedic Village came up right next to where he lived, and his fortunes rose along with that of the resort, said a neighbour.        
	The police are looking for Gaffar Mollah and his associates, who are part of the land mafia and also have connections with Vedic Village, home secretary Ardhendu Sen said, without explaining what the law enforcement agencies had been doing if they were privy to such information.        
	In less than a decade, Gaffar  a masons son who used to share a hut with his parents and nine siblings  went from being a poverty-stricken villager to the owner of a Bolero and a two-storeyed house flaunting Belgian glass on the windows.         
	The land dealer, who neighbours said fled the house along with his wife and four children a little after midnight yesterday, also got into the polices bad books along the way. There are several pending cases against his name, including for murder, said an officer.        
	Gaffars parents and siblings still live in shanties adjoining the house that he built, though neighbours say all of them have benefited from his prosperity and clout in some way or the other.        
	Apart from brokering land deals, Gaffar is known to be close to some CPM leaders and criminals who provided weapons to his personal army. Around two years ago, he started supplying building materials.        
	He would also meddle in dealings between realtors and other suppliers. His reach extended to 21 villages and nobody dared oppose him, said Rahamat Miyan, a building materials supplier who added that Gaffar owed him Rs 36,000. Gaffars aides would threaten me whenever I asked for the money, Miyan said.         
	Zakir Hussain, a cousin of Gaffar, said he had severed ties with him because of his reputation. We have nothing to do with that family, he said.         
	A neighbour who works as a mason pointed to the locked gate leading from Gaffars plot to Vedic Village. His lifestyle changed after that resort came up. He later developed ties with other realtors. A picture of him on the rogues gallery of Rajarhat police station was taken off at the behest of his realtor friends, the neighbour said.        
	Henchmen Alauddin Mondal, Mintu Molla and Nendu  all three are absconding  controlled Gaffars mastan bahini, investigators said.        
	Raj Kishore Modi, the managing director of Vedic Realty, which built the luxury resort and ownership bungalows, said: Many local residents have been associated with our project as brokers and materials suppliers. Gaffar might be one of them, but he was certainly not on our payroll.

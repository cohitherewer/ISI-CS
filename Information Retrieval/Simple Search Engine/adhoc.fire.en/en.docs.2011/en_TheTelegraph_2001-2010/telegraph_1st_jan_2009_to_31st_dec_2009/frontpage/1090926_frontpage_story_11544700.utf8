	New Delhi, Sept. 25: The Indian Air Force is strengthening its defences on the northern and western borders with China and Pakistan by moving fighter aircraft squadrons and installing modern radars, the chief of the western air command, Air Marshal N.A.K. Browne, said here today.        
	Two squadrons of the air forces most modern fighter aircraft, the Sukhoi 30mki, will be based in the western sector, possibly at Halwara in Punjab. In June, the IAF began moving a squadron of the same aircraft to Tezpur in Assam.        
	While the movements are meant to strengthen air-power capabilities against Pakistan and China, they are also replacements for squadrons of older fighter aircraft that the IAF is phasing out.        
	Air Marshal Browne said the IAF was also setting up radar stations along the Line of Actual Control with China in Ladakh, where intrusions were reported recently.        
	The air force is keenly examining the option of special type of radars, which we call the mountain radars and we are also looking at low-level light weight radar (LLLWR). So there is a definite plan, said Browne.        
	The chief of the western air command  the only theatre of the IAF that is defined by borders with Pakistan and China  said the IAF was acquiring and had capabilities matching that of the Chinese. He drew a distinction between capabilities of the air force vis--vis China and the number of aircraft vis--vis China.        
	He said the western air command had the capabilities to counter aggression from the air. Brownes view contrasts with that of the chief of air staff, Air Chief Marshal P.V. Naik, who said in Gandhinagar on Thursday that Indias air force was just a third of the size of Chinas.        
	The government is doing a lot to augment air force capability, said Naik. It is giving full support as far as acquisition is concerned, he added.        
	The air force and the army are currently engaged in rebuilding old or creating new military facilities along the border with China. Earlier this month, Browne was in an air force AN-32 transporter that landed at the Nyoma advanced landing ground (ALG) in Ladakh close to the China border.         
	The Nyoma ALG was reopened after 42 years for fixed-wing aircraft. Browne said it would be possible for fighter aircraft to land and take off from Nyoma soon.

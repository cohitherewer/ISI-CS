          A STAFF REPORTER                            The wreckage of the bus and the truck in Uluberia. Picture by Gopal Senapati                                  
	Uluberia, Dec. 13: At least 21 people were killed today in a high-speed crash between a packed bus and a 10-wheeler truck illegally speeding down the opposite end of the same flank of the six-lane Bombay Road, around 50km from Calcutta.        
	The collision occurred around 6.45pm at Kulgachia, seconds after the city-bound truck had crossed over to the other flank through an opening in the divider to presumably reach a fuel station or a dhaba of the drivers choice on that side of the road.        
	The tragedy brought to the fore the perils of a persistent menace on Bengals highways: drivers sneaking across dividers to avoid farther but safer turning points, especially at night, putting lives in danger. The same road is frequented by Calcuttans for weekend drives to roadside eateries.        
	Most of the casualties in the collision were passengers standing or sitting inside the bus or those perched on the roof of the vehicle, headed from Howrah station to the riverside village retreat of Gadiara, around 90km from the city. Police said 66 people were injured, around 10 of them critically.        
	There were at least 100 of us on the bus. I was standing at the rear end when I heard a deafening noise and tumbled over. The next thing I knew, I was under a heap of people, said a survivor, 34-year-old Adwaita Pramanik.        
	At least seven of the victims died at Uluberia subdivisional hospital, an apology of a healthcare centre with neither the infrastructure nor the expertise to dispense emergency trauma care.        
	Today being a Sunday, most doctors of the hospital were not on duty when the injured were brought in. Oxygen cylinders and medicines were also in short supply. Medical supplies and doctors from nearby nursing homes were brought in to cope with the emergency.        
	I was trapped in the debris for at least 10 minutes but lucky to come out without major injuries. Given the chaos at the hospital, I doubt whether any of those who were brought in critically injured survived, said Srikanta Hazra, 25, a passenger injured in the left leg and arm.        
	Officials later shifted 26 of the injured to SSKM Hospital, where railway minister Mamata Banerjee visited them.        
	Howrah superintendent of police Harikishore Kusumakar said the driver of the 10-wheeler truck  he was among the dead  was primarily responsible for the accident, the worst on this highway in recent memory.        
	On whether the police werent equally to blame given the lax policing along the busy highway, the officer said: We do book vehicles for rash driving. Unfortunately, there were no police personnel on that particular stretch this evening.        
	Calcuttans drive down Bombay Road, or National Highway 6, regularly on weekends and other holidays to eat at the dhabas and restaurants dotting the stretch from Uluberia to Kolaghat. Most accidents occur after dusk when the highway is buzzing with heavy vehicles that stop in the middle of the road or illegally cross over to the other flank to get to fuel pumps or eateries of their choice.        
	I have travelled on this highway and have had several close shaves myself because of rash driving by truck drivers. The fact that it has happened to me despite police patrol cars escorting my vehicle means nobody is safe on this road, said state minister Rabin Ghosh, who visited SSKM.        
	The minister said policing was a major problem on the highway. I have spoken to chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee about how accident-prone this highway is, Ghosh added.

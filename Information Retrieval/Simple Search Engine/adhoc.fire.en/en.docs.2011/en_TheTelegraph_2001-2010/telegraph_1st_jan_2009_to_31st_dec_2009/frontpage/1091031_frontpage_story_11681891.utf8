  - Big step for those who dont use Latin characters                              ICANN CEO Rod Beckstrom. (AP)                                  
	Seoul, Oct. 30 (AP): The non-profit body that oversees Internet addresses today approved the use of Hebrew, Hindi, Korean and other scripts not based on Latin characters in a decision that could make the Web dramatically more inclusive.        
	The board of the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers  or ICANN  voted to allow such scripts in so-called domain names at the conclusion of a week-long meeting in Seoul. The decision by the boards 15 voting members was unopposed and welcomed by applause and a standing ovation. It followed years of debate and testing.        
	The result clears the way for governments or their designees to submit requests for specific names, likely to begin on November 16. Internet users could start seeing them in use early next year, particularly in Arabic, Chinese and other scripts in which demand has been among the highest, ICANN officials say.        
	This represents one small step for ICANN, but one big step for half of mankind who use non-Latin scripts, such as those in Korea, China and the Arabic speaking world as well as across Asia, Africa, and the rest of the world, Rod Beckstrom, ICANNs CEO, said ahead of the vote.        
	Domain names  the Internet addresses that end in .com and other suffixes  are the key monikers behind every website, email address and Twitter post.         
	Since their creation in the 1980s, domain names have been limited to the 26 characters in the Latin alphabet used in English  A-Z  as well as 10 numerals and the hyphen. Technical tricks have been used to allow portions of the Internet address to use other scripts, but until now, the suffix had to use those 37 characters.        
	 That has meant Internet users with little or no knowledge of English might still have to type in Latin characters to access Web pages in Chinese or Arabic. Although search engines can sometimes help users reach those sites, companies still need to include Latin characters on billboards.        
	Non-Latin versions of .com and .org will not be permitted for at least a few more years as ICANN considers broader policy questions such as whether the incumbent operator of .com should automatically get a Chinese version., or whether that more properly goes to China, as its government insists.

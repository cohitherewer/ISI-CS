The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Seats on sale for no-fly day 
                                                                                                           Seats on sale for no-fly day 
  - Airlines offer tickets for August 18, IndiGo pulls out           SANJOY MANDAL AND JAYANTA ROY CHOWDHURY                                                    
	Aug.1: If the government wants proof of how desperate private airlines are, it need look no farther than their online booking sites. They are selling tickets for the day their planes are not supposed to fly.        
	Jet and Kingfisher are among those continuing to offer tickets for August 18, the day they have threatened to suspend flights to press the demand to reduce fuel tax.        
	The inventory for booking is open for sales. We have not been asked to close bookings for August 18, a Jet Airways employee said.        
	Cracks have already emerged in the airline industry on a day the government asked the airlines to explain within 48 hours why they needed to suspend flights on August 18.        
	IndiGo, part of the federation that announced the suspension of flights, said tonight it would not take part in the protest and would operate normal services on August 18. We should all engage in a dialogue with the (civil aviation) ministry, IndiGo Airlines president Aditya Ghosh said.        
	 Civil aviation officials said they expected more airlines, especially low-cost carriers that are not as deep in losses as Kingfisher and Jet, to follow suit. They added that SpiceJet and Paramount could announce in a day or two plans to operate flights on August 18. If that happens, the plan to ground the flights could well fizzle out.        
	The Federation of Indian Airlines has said its members will be happy to enter into discussions with government and re-consider their unanimous decision to suspend operations if their difficulties are addressed.        
	In case all airlines decide to keep the planes running, they are well prepared. Tickets are being offered through travel agents, too, as usual. Last evening, there was an internal message to close bookings for August 18. But today another internal message told us to open the bookings for the date, said a Kingfisher official.        
	Travel agents said they had not been asked to stop bookings for any day. We have done bookings for the date on various private airlines. The bookings have not been closed by the airlines and they have not asked us to stop bookings, said Anil Punjabi, chairman (east), the Travel Agents Federation of India.        
	Aviation industry sources in Delhi said the private airlines stood to lose between Rs 80 crore and Rs 100 crore if operations were suspended for a day.        
	While issuing the notice seeking explanation, the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA), the government-appointed regulator, also asked the airlines to refund passengers of the cancelled flights in 48 hours. The airlines had already said they would refund the money.        
	The DGCA issued notices to the private airlines to confirm that they would give an explanation and refund passengers on the cancelled flights. Any non-compliance may attract legal action as provided in the Aircraft Act, the regulator said. The DGCA has the powers to suspend or cancel airline licences and take away aircraft in case of an emergency.        
	The government understands the difficulties being faced by the aviation sector. However, the government does not support any move that will inconvenience the travelling public of the country, civil aviation minister Praful Patel added in a statement.         
	Officials said the DGCA notice was intended to dispel perceptions that sections of the government were keen to treat the airline industry with kid gloves.        
	The finance minister is believed to have talked to Patel and made it clear that the government should take a tough line on the threat to suspend flights.        
	Government sources interpreted as a softening of stand the airlines iteration today that they were not seeking a bailout but lowering of the fuel tax and a cap on airport charges.         
	Both government and airline sources agreed that ultimately, there will be talks.         
	The Federation of Indian Airlines said it wishes to clarify that this decision (to stop flights on August 18) is neither a threat nor blackmail nor a desire to pressurise.... It is emphatically denied         
	that member airlines are seeking any charity or bailout from the government. FIA does not wish to burden the government with such demands.        
	Anil Baijal, a former chairman of Indian Airlines and the current secretary-general of the FIA told The Telegraph: There is no economic regulator at the moment, so we can only hold a dialogue with the government on these issues.         
	However, former bureaucrat Yashwant Bhave today took over as the first chairperson of the Airports Economic Regulatory Authority, a watchdog that will play a key role if talks are called.

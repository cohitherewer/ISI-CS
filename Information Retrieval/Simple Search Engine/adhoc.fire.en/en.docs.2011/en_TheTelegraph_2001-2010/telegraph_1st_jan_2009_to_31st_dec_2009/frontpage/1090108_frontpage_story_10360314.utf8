The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Kasab gets country, NSA the boot
                                                                                                           Kasab gets country, NSA the boot
          NASIR JAFFRY AND OUR BUREAU                            Durrani, who has been dismissed as NSA                                  
	Islamabad/New Delhi, Jan. 7: Pakistan today finally confirmed that captured Mumbai terrorist Mohammad Ajmal Kasab is a citizen of the country but sacked its national security adviser for suggesting as much to an Indian TV channel earlier.        
	The seemingly incongruous actions are being seen as a reflection of the intense pulls and pressure Pakistan is facing from the army and the US.        
	The Americans have been steadily pushing Pakistan to take some step that would appease India which iterated today more than once that all options were open. The pressure had gone up another notch yesterday when India handed Pakistan a dossier of intercepts and other evidence, apparently put together on the basis of inputs mostly supplied by US agencies.         
	We have just been informed by authorities concerned that Ajmal Kasab is a Pakistani national, said Mohammed Sadiq, a spokesperson for the Pakistan foreign office.        
	Sadiq refused to elaborate or give details on how Islamabad had suddenly come to the conclusion after consistently denying for over a month Indias claim that the terrorist was a Pakistani national. Pakistan had earlier said it could not find Kasabs name in a national database of citizens.        
	Information minister Sherry Rehman also confirmed Kasabs Pakistani nationality. We are confirming Kasab is from Pakistan but investigations are ongoing, Pakistans Dawn newspaper quoted her as saying in a text message.        
	But hours after the confirmation, the government sacked national security adviser Mahmud Ali Durrani for speaking on the issue to an Indian channel.        
	Durrani, a retired major general appointed by Pervez Musharraf, was sacked by Prime Minister Yousaf Raza Gilani but observers saw the hand of the army in the late-night action. They also referred to a revelation, apparently made in December but disclosed earlier in the day, by the ISI chief that he had been willing to come to India after the Mumbai attacks but many people here (Islamabad) were not  seen as a reference to the army brass.               
	Some observers wondered whether the civilian government was holding out Durranis dismissal as a carrot to the army on a day Kasabs roots were officially confirmed. Another theory was the government just used the chance to get rid of the Musharraf nominee who was ambassador to the US when the generals writ ran.        
	He (Durrani) has been asked to step down for not taking the Prime Minister into confidence while giving a statement to an Indian TV channel, a spokesperson in Gilanis office said.         
	Durrani had told CNN-IBN on December 29 that Kasab could be a Pakistani, a statement that did not go down too well with the establishment in Islamabad which was still denying Delhis claim. GEO TV quoted Gilani as saying that Durranis statement had tarnished the countrys image.        
	Tonight, Durrani spoke to another Indian TV channel: I have not done anything wrong. I wish the government good luck in tackling security issues. I was supposed to tell media that Kasab is Pakistani.         
	Indian officials were circumspect on the official confirmation of Kasab being a Pakistani, pointing out that they were yet to see any positive steps being taken by Islamabad in the right direction.         
	We want our neighbour to investigate the involvement of elements in its territory and bring them to justice. We see statements in contradiction from across the border, different talking heads saying different things. What we want is action and we are waiting for that, said an official.         
	Defence minister A.K. Antony, who had earlier ruled out war between the neighbours, today said India would examine all available, possible options. There is no serious attempt to dismantle terror outfits working across the border. This is our major worry, Antony said in Delhi.        
	Hours later, foreign minister Pranab Mukherjee echoed Antony. I say we are keeping all options open, Mukherjee told a TV channel.        
	Delhis scepticism and growing frustration at Islamabads inaction have deepened after Pakistan yesterday summarily rejected as insufficient the dossier of evidence which India says definitively proves that the attack on Mumbai was launched from across the border.        
	Since the terrorist attack on Mumbai on November 26, the government of Pakistan has asked India for evidence. On January 5, we gave them the evidence. Less than 24 hours later, the Pakistan foreign office chose to reject this evidence. How can this rejection be credible or be based on a real examination and investigation of the evidence? This is a political rejection without any basis, said Vishnu Parakeet, the spokesperson for the foreign ministry.         
	India has stepped up its diplomatic offensive in the past 48 hours with Mukherjee writing to 180 of his counterparts across the globe and his office sharing evidence with some 130 mission chiefs. US assistant secretary of state Richard Boucher, who was in Islamabad on Monday, is scheduled to hold talks with Indian officials tomorrow.         
	Pakistani officials insisted that the admission on Kasab was not a result of diplomatic pressure. Pakistan would not bow to any pressure from any country, including India. We are carrying out our own independent investigation in line with our policy to extend full co-operation to India to unearth the culprits, said a senior official who did not wish to be named.        
	Kasab, who was part of the module which attacked Victoria Terminus and Cama Hospital and killed three Mumbai policemen, has already written to the Pakistani high commission in Delhi asking for consular access and legal assistance.         
	ISI chief was ready         
	Pakistans ISI chief Lt Gen Ahmad Shuja Pasha has said he was ready to go to India after the Mumbai attacks to help with the investigations, a German newspaper reported.        
	Pasha, however, added that others in his country were not game. Many people here are simply not ready, he told Der Spiegel in an interview in December, possibly hinting at objections from the army brass.        
	Pasha seldom gives interviews to reporters, and one of his aides said today that the comments made in early December were meant to be off the record. Der Spiegel declined to comment on the aides claims.        
	Pasha said Pakistan had initially feared an Indian strikeback post 26/11 but had realised soon enough that terrorism, not New Delhi, was its prime enemy.        
	We may be crazy in Pakistan, but not completely out of our minds. We know full well that terror is our enemy, not India. At first, we thought there would be a military reaction... as the Indians, after the attacks, were deeply offended and furious, but they are also clever.

	Nagaon/Silchar, April 20: Suspected militants of the Dima Halam Daogah (Jewel Gorlosa) continued their spate of attacks in Assams North Cachar Hills district with twin attacks on a private cement companys convoy of vehicles and an office today. Five jawans and a civilian were gunned down in the ambush on the convoy.         
	The militants ambushed the 20-truck convoy of Vinay Cement Company at Panimur Kalanala, near the industrial town of Umrangsu and 170km from the district headquarters of Haflong, under Doyangmukh police station, just after noon. They attacked the companys office at Umrangsu this evening.        
	A police official said the militants fired only on the two trucks in which jawans of 16 IRB were escorting the companys employees from Lanka to Umrangsu. The jawans were in the back of the trucks.         
	The police said the insurgents, who were hiding in the hilly jungles, opened fire from automatic weapons on the unsuspecting security personnel.        
	The entire ambush was carried out in a matter of minutes. The rebels fled into the jungles, taking with them five guns of the IRB personnel.        
	Superintendent of police Mridulananda Sarma said the security personnel retaliated from the moving trucks, but that failed to save the jawans.        
	Sarma said there were nine IRB personnel in the convoy of whom five  four constables and a havildar  were killed. The sixth was the driver of a truck in the convoy.         
	They have been identified as havildar Sayeed Ali, and constables Ramen Saikia, Akash Ali, Gulam Hussain and Golap Saikia. The truck driver was identified as Birmangal Singh.         
	The police said the trucks were returning from Lanka after offloading cement carried from the Umrangsu-based Vinay Cement Ltd.         
	Police and CRPF personnel from Umrangsu launched a combing operation in the nearby jungles, but the militants had not been traced so far.         
	Deputy commissioner S. Jagannathan said the IRB personnel had been deployed at Vinay Cement Ltd after the companys trucks were attacked at Krungminglangsu on May 14 last year.         
	Tight security arrangements have since been made for vehicles running on the route.         
	Todays ambush, described as one of the biggest by the rebels in the district in recent times, came after last nights raid on a camp of the Railway Protection Security Force at Harangajao village in the district. Two jawans, Atul Kumar and Ranjit Kumar Kanojia, were injured in the attack.         
	They were shifted to Silchar Medical College and Hospital after preliminary treatment at a primary health centre near Harangajao railway station.                                      
	The militants managed to flee before the security force could retaliate.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Blast scare for   Pranab 
                                                                                                           Blast scare for   Pranab 
          OUR BUREAU                             Mukherjee                                        
	March 31: A motorbike bomb exploded less than a kilometre from the venue of an election meeting addressed by foreign minister Pranab Mukherjee in Guwahati this evening, killing one person and injuring 10.        
	The bomb, which went off in the residential Jyotikuchi Tinali 15 minutes after the scheduled start of the meeting, was not placed on the route Mukherjee took.        
	Actress and BJP campaigner Hema Malini was also in the city to address a rally when the blast took place.         
	The hand of Ulfa, a faction of which is known for its opposition to elections, is being suspected. The bomb had several similarities with the one that exploded on P. Chidambarams route when the new home minister visited Guwahati on New Years Day.        
	Mukherjee did address the meeting, though his arrival was further delayed by the explosion at 5.45pm. Mukherjee spoke at 6.30pm, instead of the scheduled 5.30pm.        
	The Congress called off Mukherjees second meeting in the city. Sources said he would resume campaigning tomorrow.        
	Police said the blast victim, yet to be identified, appeared to be a day labourer. Among the injured is a Class VII student, Mantu Chetri. The motorcycle to which the bomb was strapped split into two.        
	The explosion took place soon after Mukherjee said Bangladesh was warming up to a request to extradite militants holed up there.

          OUR BUREAU                                    
	Guwahati/Calcutta, June 21: Assam police today arrested Pakhi Miyan, the kingpin of the biggest drug cartel in the Northeast and also a murder accused, from Durgapur, the industrial hub of West Bengal.         
	The druglord was netted from the Nayeemnagar area of Durgapur, around 11am, six months after his daring escape from the Gauhati Medical College Hospital where he was undergoing treatment in judicial custody.         
	Miyans arrest came as a huge relief for Assam police, riddled with accusations that they were not active in pursuing criminal cases registered against Miyan for his powerful political links.        
	The director-general of Assam police, G.M. Srivastava, said the fugitive was arrested with the assistance of the special task force of Calcutta police in Durgapur, 168km from Calcutta.         
	A probe revealed that Miyan had been staying at a rented flat in the Nayeemnagar area for the past one-and-a-half years.         
	Landlord Abdul Qadir told the investigators that he had introduced himself as a businessman dealing in transport.         
	Qadir told us that Miyan would leave everyday after offering daily morning prayers and returned late at night. He never interacted with his neighbours, an officer said.         
	The sleuths suspect that Miyan had arrived in Durgapur with some local contacts. Raids are on to apprehend them.         
	The joint commissioner of the STF, Rajiv Kumar, said acting on a tip off, the officers raided the house and arrested Miyan. We were on the lookout for him at five different places. After locating him we took the assistance of the Special Task Force of Calcutta police and arrested him, Srivastava said.        
	It was like the operation in Bangalore where we arrested DHD (J) chairman Jewel Gorlosa. There, too, Assam police had taken the help of police from the city.        
	There were several cases registered against Miyan at Nagaon, Karbi Anglong and Guwahati, including the murder of revenue intelligence officer Tarun Kumar Dutta on September 12, 2006 at Krishna Nagar in Guwahati.         
	The CBI is investigating the case.         
	Miyan, wanted for his alleged involvement in two other murder cases, was arrested by Bengal police along with contraband drugs from a flat at Baguihati in Calcutta in April last year.         
	He was later handed over to Assam police.        
	He was shifted to the GMCH from the Central Jail in Guwahati on December 19 and was undergoing treatment for diabetes and hernia during judicial custody in the male surgical ward on the second floor of the GMCH. He escaped on December 22.        
	Miyan is also allegedly involved in the murder of AGP leader Habib Ali and the journalist of a local vernacular newspaper, Muslimuddin Ahmed.         
	Miyan drugged the police constable guarding him by offering him coffee laced with some intoxicating substance before fleeing the hospital.         
	His son Ataur, alias Lohit Kumar, who was with him at the hospital as his attendant, helped him to escape as he too went missing.        
	Miyan was defeated in the 2001 Assembly election from the Jamunamukh constituency. He is from Borhawa in Morajhar under Hojai subdivision of Nagaon district.

	Amartya Sen said on Saturday that the   curriculum overload in primary schools was destroying the purpose of elementary education mdash; to bridge the inequalities in society.  
	 Releasing The Pratichi Education Report II in Calcutta, the Nobel laureate called for   an overhaul in children rsquo;s curriculum in   Bengal ldquo;right here right now rdquo;.  
	 ldquo;Those who are first-generation   learners do not get parents rsquo; support at home and, if they come from economically weaker   sections... they can rsquo;t afford private tuition.   
	 As a result, the children of the illiterate   tend to remain illiterate.... rdquo;  The report says parents consider   that schools are doing better and teacher   absenteeism has reduced compared with 2001-2, when the trust had conducted its first survey, but students rsquo; dependence   on private tuition is on the rise.  
	 Sen said private tuition did not play any important role when the US or Europe became mass literate in the 19th century. ldquo;My son Kabir teaches in a school in Boston. He says kids don rsquo;t bring any home task. rdquo;  
	 Parents might want private tuition for their kids to learn something ldquo;extra rdquo; but that, Sen said, shouldn rsquo;t mean the curriculum can rsquo;t be completed within school time.               
	As the guru made a pitch to make life easier for children, a disciple urged his audience to keep in mind that as they celebrated Indias growth story, many were being left behind.  
	At the reunion of the St Xaviers School old boys association, Kaushik Basu said: In India, there are about 220 to 280 million people who are poor, not just slightly poor but abysmally poor. Such chronic poverty for a country with 9 per cent growth is unpardonable.         
	Basu, now the chief economic adviser to the Union finance ministry, had completed his PhD thesis under Sens supervision in 1976.         
	Poverty, red tape and corruption are the biggest ills plaguing India, he feels. Getting clearance for a new business in India takes six times more time than in Singapore. In India it takes 1,420 days to get a contract enforced, in Singapore it takes six months.        
	The need of the hour, according to him: streamlining the bureaucratic system, cutting down corruption and eradicating poverty.         
	The pill: intelligent policy intervention, development of infrastructure, and the government in the role of an enabler. As the guru made a pitch to make life easier for children, a disciple urged his audience to keep in mind that as they celebrated Indias growth story, many were being left behind.

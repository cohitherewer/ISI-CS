	The alliance, known as the March 14 coalition, won the majority in the 128-member parliament with 71 seats, compared with to 57 for the Hezbollah-led coalition, according to official results announced today by the government. The results represent a significant and unexpected defeat for Hezbollah and its allies, Iran and Syria. Most polls had showed a tight race, but one in which the Hezbollah-led group would win.        
	In Washington, President Barack Obama pledged solidarity with the anti-Syrian bloc, saying the countrys peaceful election showed the Lebanese peoples commitment to democracy.        
	The winners celebrated in the streets, setting off fireworks and driving around in motorcades honking hours before the official results were even announced. The victory may have been aided by nearly unprecedented turnout. Preliminary results showed that about 55 per cent of the 3.26 million registered voters cast ballots.         
	Though the Hezbollah-led challengers lost, Hezbollah itself will continue to be one of Lebanons most powerful political forces. The biggest disappointment in this election well be for Michel Aoun, a retired general who aligned his party with Hezbollah.        
	The March 14 coalition is a predominantly Sunni, Christian and Druze alliance. It is led by the Sunni Future Movement of Saad Hariri, whose fathers assassination in 2005 led to huge protests that forced Syria to withdraw its troops from Lebanon.         
	The majority party in parliament gets to build the next government and set the direction of national policy.                             NEW YORK TIMES NEWS SERVICE

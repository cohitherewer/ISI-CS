	New Delhi, Sept. 10: Five schoolgirls died in a stampede on a cramped Delhi schools lone staircase after authorities made a sudden, confusing announcement of a change in exam sitting arrangements for 5,000 students.        
	Another 34 girls were injured in the crush, set off when at least 3,000 students rushed together into the two-storey school building through its single entry point, and then hundreds made for the stairs while another group was coming down.        
	The stampedes trigger remained unclear amid conflicting versions, one of which said a few boy students had tried to molest some of the girls on the staircase.        
	The stairway is narrow, only 4.5ft wide. Five suffocated and many more are still in hospital, said joint commissioner of police (JCP) Dharmendra Kumar.        
	Some 2,500 boys and 2,500 girls ---- from Classes VII to XII except Class X --- had arrived for their half-yearly exams at the Government Boys/Girls Senior Secondary School, which has thousands of students but just six classrooms.        
	The boys were to take their exams in a huge tin shed on the compound, some of the girls in the classrooms, and the rest of the girls in the open courtyard, sitting on the ground.        
	However, overnight rain had turned the school grounds into a cesspool. After the outdoor examinees protested, the authorities announced all exams would be held inside, setting off a race to get into the building.        
	Several boys had run up to the first-floor rooms when the authorities made a second announcement: the boys had to sit in the ground-floor rooms and the girls upstairs. The stampede followed soon after.        
	The tragedy highlights the poor infrastructure in some government schools at a time the Centre is treating education as a priority and crores are being spent to give the capital a makeover ahead of next years Commonwealth Games.        
	The school, which teaches students from Class V to XII, is forced to hold most of its classes in its open courtyard. The classes are held in different shifts for boys and girls but both groups were to sit todays exam together.        
	None of the boys were injured. Chief minister Sheila Dikshit denied the molestation theory as rumours but the parents of some injured girls said their daughters clothes were torn and some had scratch marks on their bodies.        
	Sunita, a Class VIII student, said some boys had tried to grope the girls. We were on the staircase when the boys blocked our way from the front and back. They started pushing us and then all of us fell on each other on the stairs. Our teachers rescued us after removing the boys from over us, she said.        
	Class XII student Neha, who fractured her left hand, however, suggested that some boys were merely pushing others on the staircase to get right of way.        
	The father of injured student Tabassum, however, said that when the girls went to a classroom upstairs, some unknown boys, who were not in uniform, started teasing them and the scared girls ran out and tripped over each other.        
	Dikshit said the girls were rushing to get to the classrooms and two groups, one climbing up and the other coming down, clashed and fell over each other.

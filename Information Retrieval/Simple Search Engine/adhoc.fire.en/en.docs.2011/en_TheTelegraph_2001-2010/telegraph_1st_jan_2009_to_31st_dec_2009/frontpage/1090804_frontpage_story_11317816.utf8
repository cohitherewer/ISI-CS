The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Protests over killings intensify 
                                                                                                           Protests over killings intensify 
  - CPI member resigns from Manipur coalition panel          OUR CORRESPONDENT                                           
	Imphal, Aug. 3: Protesters today continued to fight pitched battles with police at Khurai in Imphal East for the second consecutive day over the July 23 shootout, while the secretary of the ruling Secular Progressive Fronts steering committee resigned from his post.         
	Moirangthem Nara Singh of the CPI, which is a partner in the Congress-led SPF coalition, later told The Telegraph that he could no longer continue to hold the post under the prevailing circumstances.        
	Earlier, a statement issued by party secretary Langol Iboyaima had said, The central committee of the CPI today accepted Nara Singhs resignation from the post of SPF steering committee secretary. We decided to intimate the partys decision to chief minister Okram Ibobi Singh, who is the chairman of the steering committee.         
	It did not give any reason for his resignation.        
	A pregnant woman vendor, Rabina Devi, and a former militant, Ch. Sanjit, were killed and five civilians wounded in the city on July 23.         
	The police said indiscriminate firing by Sanjit had caused the death and injuries.         
	The people, however, claimed that Rabina Devi had died in police firing and Sanjit was not a militant.        
	A recent report by a Delhi-based portal, accompanied by pictures that showed police leading Sanjit inside a pharmacy and coming out with his lifeless body, injected fresh blood into the ongoing agitation.         
	Sanjits locality, Khurai in Imphal East, continued to resemble a battleground today, as protests over fake encounter grew more violent.         
	As the police fired teargas shells and rubber bullets, the protesters, mostly young boys, hit back with marbles and pebbles, using catapults.         
	Both the police and protesters pelted stones. The battle continued till late in the afternoon.         
	It is our teargas and rubber bullets versus their marbles shot from catapults. The fight started at 9am. Fortunately, no one was injured, a police officer leading the force said.         
	Though most people stayed indoors during the 48-hour general strike called by Apunba Lup, a conglomeration of NGOs, a large number of protesters turned out on the streets and blocked roads by burning logs and tyres in the twin districts of Imphal. The strike began at midnight last night.         
	The protesters put up womenswear, including undergarments, across streets and burnt effigies of Ibobi Singh and director-general of police Yumnam Joykumar Singh.         
	The bandh evoked a total response in the valley with markets, government offices, educational institutions, banks and petrol pumps remaining closed. Vehicles also stayed off the roads.        
	CPI sources said Nara Singhs resignation was the direct fallout of the July 23 shootout.         
	The CPI has entrusted Pheiroijam Parijat Singh, its lone representative in Okram Ibobi Singhs council of ministers, to press a judicial inquiry into the incident when the chief minister returns from Delhi.         
	Nara Singhs resignation and the CPI support to the peoples demand for judicial inquiry is the first signal to Ibobi Singh, who also holds the home portfolio, that the coalition partner is not happy with the handling of the situation.         
	In a related development, Opposition Manipur Peoples Party submitted a memorandum to Governor Gurbachan Jagat this afternoon.         
	It demanded a judicial inquiry into the shootout, action against the personnel that caused the casualties and dismissal of the Ibobi Singh government.        
	The governor assured the delegation that he would take a concrete decision on the case after getting reports from all angles including from the government.

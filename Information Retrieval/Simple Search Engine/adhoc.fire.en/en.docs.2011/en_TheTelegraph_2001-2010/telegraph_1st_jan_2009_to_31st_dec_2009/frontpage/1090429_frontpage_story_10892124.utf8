The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Kalahandi or not, job hunger gnaws
                                                                                                           Kalahandi or not, job hunger gnaws
          DEVADEEP PUROHIT                                               
	Bankura/Purulia, April 28: Rebecca Soren has never been to a school. The 19-year-old girl cant afford two square meals a day. She is also a suspected Maoist who spent 19 months behind bars.         
	Ganesh Deshwali is a primary school dropout but knows how to use his cellphone. The 19-year-old is a marginal worker  which means he doesnt get work six months a year.         
	When Rahul Gandhi compared Purulia with Kalahandi  the symbol of starvation and criticised the state government for lack of development in Bankura, Left leaders called him immature and said the situation was better off than that in Amethi.        
	Away from the war of statistics, the stories of Rebecca and Ganesh easily make them the faces of deprivation in Purulia and Bankura, among the most backward districts in the state.         
	We were working in a local dam project under the 100-day work scheme. As we were not getting our payments regularly, we had protested. A few days after that, some plainclothes men came to our village and took me away, recounts Rebecca, now out on bail.        
	She lives in Simni near the Purulia-Jharkhand border. Police sources said Maoists from bordering Jharkhand frequent the village but they have not found evidence against the girl. But Rebecca has got a Maoist tag for life.        
	Unable to bear the torture in the jail, I admitted that I was a Maoist, she says, her eyes welling up as she recalls the 19 months she spent in jails in Purulia and Hazaribag.         
	Her younger brother Shantiram knows he cannot marry off his sister. No one will marry her because she has been to jail, adds the boy, who passed Madhyamik last year.         
	Instead of carrying on with studies, the 16-year-old has turned a day labourer. Back in her village after serving jail term on suspicion, Rebecca  along with her five sisters  is trying to earn money to repay a debt of Rs 60,000 the family ran up to fight her legal battle.         
	In search of work, her father Sabran Soren has gone to Bangalore, making her brother-in-law Mahadev the head of the family. The biggest problem here is getting work, says Mahadev, sitting outside the mud house.        
	Ganesh, who lives in Bankuras Chanpaboni, echoes him and explains why even getting work cannot solve their problems. I cant earn more than Rs 20 to Rs 30 even on days when I get work, says the labourer.        
	Ganesh has a job card, which makes him eligible for at least 100 days of work under the rural job scheme. But he hasnt got even 10 days of work in the last year.        
	Despite the Left protestations, even the state governments data (the West Bengal Human Development Report, 2004) reveals that only 19.69 per cent of the male population in Purulia got work for more than 183 days a year. In Bankura, the percentage is a shade better at 23.87 per cent.         
	As irrigation remains a major bottleneck in the two districts, the problem gets compounded, says economist Ratan Khasnabis, who has carried out a survey on the backward villages in the state.        
	In terms of per capita monthly consumption, an indicator of the populations well being, the districts fare poorly  Rs 353.28 for Bankura and Rs 280.15 for Purulia.        
	That explains why both these districts have so many backward villages  994 in Purulia and 569 in Bankura  out of 4,612 villages spread across Bengal. Both have a poor record in female literacy rates  49.80 in Bankura and 37.15 in Purulia. In Jhalda 2, the block under which Simni falls, the rate is the lowest in Asia at 18.37 per cent.        
	It is a complete failure of the state government and the Left Front MPs who have won election after election in Bankura and Purulia, says Subrata Mukherjee, the Congress candidate from Bankura.        
	But the Left leaders are passing the deprivation buck to the Congress administration that was in power 30 years ago. You have to compare the condition of the two districts before 1977 and after we came to power, says Amiya Patra, CPM district committee secretary in Bankura.        
	Khasnabis agrees with the Left argument. According to him, entitlement of the poor in the two districts has improved under the Left rule.        
	But the young do not appear convinced. I dont know what happened before I was born. And I think 32 years are enough to make a difference in peoples lives, says a final-year BA student of Bankura Christian College.         
	The young man, who has to enter the competitive job market soon, adds: I know its going to be tough as we dont have much opportunities here. Probably, I will have to shift to Calcutta.         
	That option is not available to all. Wish we could have studied. Then it would have been easier for us to shift to a city, rues Ganesh, who doesnt know how to send text messages from his cellphone.

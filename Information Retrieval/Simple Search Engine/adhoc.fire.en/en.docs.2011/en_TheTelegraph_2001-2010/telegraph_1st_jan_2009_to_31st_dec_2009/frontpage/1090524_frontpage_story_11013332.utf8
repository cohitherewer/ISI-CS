The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Obama calls with an invite
                                                                                                           Obama calls with an invite
          K.P. NAYAR                               
	Washington, May 23: Barack Obama became the first foreign leader to invite newly sworn-in Prime Minister Manmohan Singh to visit his country when the US President called up Singh to congratulate him on assuming his second term as head of government.        
	President Obama... invited the Prime Minister to visit Washington, the White House said in an unusual announcement today.        
	The announcement is unusual because Washington is shut down from Friday evening till Tuesday morning for a long Memorial Day weekend, when Americans travel more than on any other holiday, taking in the best of the spring season.        
	During their conversation, the two leaders recalled their warm meeting in London on April 2 and discussed their mutual desire to strengthen US-India relations and work together to address common global challenges, such as the economic downturn, climate change, and counter-terrorism, the White House said.        
	It is understood that the Obama administration has already drawn up a timetable to pick up the pace of Indo-US relations from where the Bush administration left off, now that a new government is in place in New Delhi.        
	The under-secretary of state for political affairs, William Burns, is to visit India next month to be followed by the secretary of state, Hillary Clinton, sources in the US state department said.        
	The new external affairs minister, S.M. Krishna, has already told some friends from the US who telephoned to congratulate him today that he would like to visit Washington in July, although the dates of his trip will only be finalised after his meetings with Clinton in New Delhi.        
	On Wednesday, the new Indian ambassador to the US, Meera Shankar, presented her credentials to Obama, just 24 days after her arrival in Washington.        
	Some of the other envoys whose credentials Obama accepted on Wednesday along with Shankars have been waiting to meet Obama for more than 100 days.        
	Obama has also not yet formally announced a new ambassador to New Delhi. But indications are that the Obama administration has been waiting to accelerate the pace of its tie-ups with India until the composition of a new government in New Delhi became apparent.        
	Obama congratulated India on successfully completing the largest democratic exercise that the world has ever seen, calling it a testament to the strength of Indias democracy in his conversation with Singh, according to the White House readout.

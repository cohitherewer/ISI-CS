	Mumbai, Jan. 16: The curious case of terror witness Anita Uddaiya, who claims to have been taken on a secret visit to the US, has got murkier with police today slapping a case against her for allegedly spreading false information.         
	The 47-year-old Mumbai scrap-dealer and some neighbours had spotted the terrorists getting down from a dinghy on 26/11.         
	The lady went missing on Sunday, which she later explained was because she had gone to Satara, 250km from Mumbai, but then came up with a stunning disclosure: she had been taken to the US for questioning.         
	Mumbai police, which had been circumspect on the disclosure made on Wednesday, today said it was undue media-attention that had led Anita to weave yarns.        
	The crime branch moved in this morning and whisked away Anita and her eldest daughter Seema to its headquarters where their statements were recorded. Later, the police on their own lodged a case under Section 182 of the IPC (deliberately spreading false information) against the two. If convicted, they can be imprisoned for up to six months.        
	Anita, who lives with her two children in a fishermens colony in Cuffe Parade area, has an ailing husband being treated at St Georges Hospital. Seema is married and lives in Virar, a distant suburb.        
	Seema had filed a missing complaint soon after her mothers disappearance, but later backed Anitas claim.        
	The joint commissioner of police (crime), Rakesh Maria, claimed Anita had gone to Rahmatpur in Satara. But he would not give details on how the police had reached the conclusion that her claim was false.         
	But Madhusudan Nair, her neighbour and a Congress activist, claimed she had stuck to her claim of being flown to the US. Till late afternoon, Anita had not returned to her 7ft by 8ft shanty.

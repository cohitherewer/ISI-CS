The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | In bat capital, a cricket family 
                                                                                                           In bat capital, a cricket family 
          MUZAFFAR RAINA                              
	Bijebehara (Anantnag), Oct. 17: Cricket is the first love of the family of former player Ghulam Rasool Zargar, and the only skills he has passed on to his three sons are about how to swing the bat and the ball well, he says.        
	Today, when he heard of son Parvezs arrest in Bangalore on the suspicion of carrying explosives, he was confident that the 21-year-olds cricket credentials would save him.        
	My family is known here as a family of cricketers. I was sure that when somebody came here to investigate my son, everyone would tell them he came from a family of cricketers. Thats the only thing we know for certain, Zargar, 50, said.        
	He added: My son told me that when security personnel entered his room (in Bangalores Chinnaswamy Stadium), they tried to get his bag sniffed by their dogs. My son objected because there was a copy of the Quran in it, lest there is any sacrilege. Perhaps this caused some confusion.        
	Bijebehara is known as the countrys bat-manufacturing capital, from where the finest willow clefts come. Thanks to the availability of these bats, cricket has become a passion for most local young men.        
	For the Zargar family, its more than a passion. I myself played for 20 years representing Bijebehara Sports; there is hardly a place in the Valley where I didnt play. I couldnt make it big but I have high hopes that my children will, said Zargar, who had to take up a government drivers job to earn a living.        
	Parvez started playing cricket at the age of six and I was his first instructor. I tried to give my children a good education and make them better cricketers, he added.        
	His eldest son Asif, 23, has played in the Ranji Trophy and so too has Parvez, 21.        
	Asif said: My youngest brother Omar, who is 17, has represented the state in the under-14 and under-17 categories. Parvez, a student of BA second year, played Ranji last year and did well as an all-rounder. My father was an all-rounder and all three of us brothers are all-rounders too.        
	Zargar said he was glad his son had been released. He called me just now and told me he was safe. Our family was certainly shocked but I was confident he would be freed.        
	Parvezs mother, however, could not hide her tears. A steady stream of neighbours came in to express support, and many said it was another instance of Kashmiris being targeted outside the state.

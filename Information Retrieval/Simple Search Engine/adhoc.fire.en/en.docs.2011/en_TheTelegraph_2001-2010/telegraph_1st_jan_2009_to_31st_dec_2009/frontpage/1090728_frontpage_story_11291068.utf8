The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Capital falls to rain invasion 
                                                                                                           Capital falls to rain invasion 
          OUR BUREAU                                         
	New Delhi, July 27: Cars were floating around and traffic snarls were snaking up to 3km in the countrys capital this evening after the monsoon dumped on Delhi more rain in three hours than what the city has received in eight weeks.        
	Late tonight, PTI reported that 10 people, including four children, were feared dead in a wall collapse in Noida.        
	Thousands of commuters were stranded on roads crippled by the worst rainfall in the capital in recent memory. Between 8.30am and 11.30pm today, Delhi was at the receiving end of 125.6mm of rainfall, according to the Safdarjung Met office.        
	 The first 12 hours accounted for 69mm, which means that in the next three hours between 8.30pm and 11.30pm, 56.6mm of rain fell. The three-hour burst was heavier than the cumulative 53.8mm rain Delhi had received since June 1, though it was nowhere near the 994mm of rain in 24 hours that swamped Mumbai on July 26, 2005.        
	The Delhi administration may need a shower of statistics to cover itself because residents were complai- ning about clogged and overflowing drainage systems in several places across the pampered city that is to host the Commonwealth Games next year.        
	I saw some cars floating after water from the clogged bylanes gushed over into the main road, said a man in his twenties at Greater Kailash-1, stepping out of his stranded car and locking it before deciding to walk home, an hour away by foot. I have been stuck here for over two hours. Its a shame, he added.         
	Not many main roads were flooded  the bylanes bore the brunt of the overflowing drains. But the pressure soon began to be felt on the main arteries as people steered clear of smaller roads and a traffic management system, unused to the pressure Mumbai or Calcutta face during the monsoon, was reduced to a helpless spectator. Buses of the Delhi Transport Corporation went off the roads. At least 15 flights from the domestic airport were affected.         
	Place after place that are household names in the country became clogged with vehicles. Connaught Place, IIT junction, AIIMS, ITO, Janpath, Rajpath  police sources said they had lost count of the distress calls pouring in.         
	Rain did not spare its recorders either. The India Meteorological Department headquarters on Lodhi Road was flooded and officials had to wade through knee-deep water to get to their cars.

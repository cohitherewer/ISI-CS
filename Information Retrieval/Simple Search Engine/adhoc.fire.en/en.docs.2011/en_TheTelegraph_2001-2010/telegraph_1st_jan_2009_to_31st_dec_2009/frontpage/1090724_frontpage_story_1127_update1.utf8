	Kolkata, July 24 (PTI): The Calcutta High Court today rejected an application by the Bengal Bus Syndicate to extend the July 31 deadline of the ban on 15-year-old commercial vehicles in the city, observing that the right of citizens to breathe pollution-free air is supreme.    A division bench of Chief Justice S S Nijjar and justice B Somadder rejected the plea of the syndicate and also a prayer by environment activist Subhas Datta for an early hearing of the prayer by the bus owners.    Transport services were crippled in the metropolis and the districts today as all private buses, mini buses and taxis went off the roads in response to a strike called by 17 transporters' organisations in the state.    The state advocate general Balai Roy in his submission told the court that the transporters had already been given one year's time to comply with the court's order and as such the deadline should not be extended.    The petition by Subhas Datta, on whose PIL the court had passed an order in July last year banning 15-year-old commercial and transport vehicles as well as two-stroke auto-rickshaws from the Kolkata Metropolitan Area, praying for an early hearing of the extension of the deadline was also not entertained by the court.    The court had ordered that after the July 31 deadline no such polluting vehicle would be allowed to ply on roads in the city.

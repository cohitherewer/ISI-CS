  Duel or dialogue, Singh asks country and cites Atal to silence BJP           SANKARSHAN THAKUR                                                     
	New Delhi, July 29: The occasion seemed tailor-made for leader of Opposition L.K. Advani to fling his favoured adjectives at Prime Minister Manmohan Singh yet again  weak, ineffective. But Advani didnt bother with them today and Singh ensured theyd have fallen flat on the floor even if he had.         
	The Prime Minister made a resounding rebuttal to the Oppositions charge of a sellout to Pakistan at Sharm-al-Sheikh in the Lok Sabha this afternoon, claiming unprecedented admissions from Islamabad on the terror issue, keeping the peace door ajar, yet assuring the nation that comprehensive dialogue wont resume until Pakistan takes credible and sustained action to dismantle the terror infrastructure.        
	It is in our vital interest to make sincere efforts to live in peace with Pakistan, but despite the best of intentions, we cannot move forward if terrorist attacks launched from Pakistani soil continue to kill and injure our citizens, here and abroad. That is the national position. I stand by it, he told the House.        
	The treasury rippled in applause, as it would many a time as he continued; the Opposition, eager to see Singh trip, lay increasingly silent and neutralised.        
	So much, that when the BJPs Sushma Swaraj rose at the end of the Prime Ministers persuasive intervention, her doubts only concerned climate change and nuclear fuel enrichment and reprocessing. It was as if Singh had swayed the Opposition his way only a day after it had gone lobbying to Rashtrapati Bhavan against the foreign policy surrender to Pakistan.        
	He did that playing politically astute peacenik. He cleverly posited war as the only option to dialogue, but even more cleverly, named former Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee as inspirer of his theme.         
	Unless we want to go to war with Pakistan, dialogue is the only way out. But we should do so on the basis of trust but verify.To his great credit, Vajpayee was not deterred (by setbacks like Kargil and Kandahar), as a statesman should not be. In 2004, he went to Islamabad, where a joint statement was issued that set out a vision for a co-operative relationship. I must remind the House that Opposition parties supported these bold steps. I, for one, share Shri Vajpayees vision, and I have also felt his frustration in dealing with Pakistan, he said, blunting the fiery attack that had earlier issued from Yashwant Sinha and his NDA colleague, Sharad Yadav.        
	Singh wasnt cavalier on promises, but hung on to hope. There are uncertainties on the horizon, and I cannot predict the future in dealing with neighbours, two nuclear powers. We have to begin to trust each other, not blindly, but trust and verify. I believe that there is a large constituency for peace in both countries. The majority of people in both countries want an honourable settlement. People say that we have broken the national consensus. I refuse to believe that we have broken the national consensus.         
	Perhaps, the only faultline in his defence was the inclusion of Pakistani threat perceptions over Balochistan in the joint statement. It has been widely interpreted as Indias indirect admission on encouraging Balochi separatists. Indeed, Yashwant Sinha of the BJP quoted a top Pakistani journalist to say Pakistani premier Yousaf Raza Gilani had handed a dossier on alleged Indian involvement in Balochistan to Prime Minister Singh at Sharm-al-Sheikh.        
	Singh immediately rose to deny he had received any such dossier, but his we-have-nothing-to-hide clarification left anxieties on the Balochistan reference unassuaged.         
	Even so, the Prime Minister wasnt conceding Pakistan more room than what the quest for a just peace requires. He had clearly arrived with two arrows on his bowstring  just as he allayed domestic concerns over signing off Indian interests in the joint statement at Sharm-al-Sheikh, he sharply reminded Pakistan that the onus for securing peace now lay with Islamabad.         
	I have to say that (the steps taken by Pakistan) do not go far enough. We hope that the (Mumbai attack) trial will make quick progress and that exemplary punishment will be meted out to those who committed this horrific crime against humanity. We need evidence that action is being taken to outlaw, disarm and shut down the terrorist groups and their front organisations that still operate on Pakistani soil and which continue to pose a grave threat to our country, he said.         
	The Prime Minister didnt name names or pin blame  close advisers say he does not want to fritter gains made behind closed doors with blustery speech-making  but few in Islamabad could have missed the message.         
	New Delhi isnt pleased with Pakistans consistent nit-picking on punishing terror plotters, latest proof of which was interior minister Rehman Maliks blunt refusal yesterday to act against Jamaat-ud-Dawa chief Hafiz Sayeed on the grounds that there isnt enough proof against him.         
	Even so, the Prime Minister appears determined to give peace, rather than war, a chance. Even as he goaded Islamabad on to more credible action, he claimed unprecedented success in coaxing Pakistan out of denial on terror. He boasted that Pakistan had hitherto neither formally briefed India on terror investigations, nor even admitted that their nationals and a terrorist organisation based in Pakistan had carried out attacks in India.        
	The reality is that this is far more than the NDA government was ever able to extract from Pakistan during its entire tenure despite all their tall talk. They were never able to get Pakistan to admit what they have admitted now. So the UPA government needs no lessons from the Opposition on how to conduct foreign affairs or secure our nation against terrorist threats, he asserted to extended thumping of desks behind him.         
	Singh detailed some of the information contained in the 34-page dossier handed over to India. The document gives details of the planning and sequence of events, details of the investigations carried out by the special Federal Investigation Agency team of Pakistan, a copy of the FIR lodged and the details and photographs of the accused in custody and those declared as proclaimed offenders.         
	It provides details of the communication networks used, financing of the operation and seizures made in Pakistan, including maps, lifeboats, literature on navigational training, intelligence manuals, backpacks etc., the Prime Minister said.         
	He added  with the rider that these steps arent enough  that five of the accused, including Zaki-ur-Rehman Lakhvi and Zarar Shah, had been arrested, thirteen others declared proclaimed offenders and a chargesheet filed against them under the Pakistani Anti-Terrorism Act.         
	We have been asked for more information, we will provide this shortly, he said, affirming that, as agreed at Sharm-al-Sheikh, the two foreign secretaries will meet in the run-up to a foreign minister-level exchange on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly in September. There was, as he emphasised time and again today, no option but to go on talking. And today, Advani patiently heard.

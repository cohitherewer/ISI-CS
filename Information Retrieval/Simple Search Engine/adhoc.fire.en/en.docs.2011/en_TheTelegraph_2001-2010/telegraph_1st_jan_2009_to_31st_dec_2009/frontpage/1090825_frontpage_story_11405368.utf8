The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Obama starts holiday with tennis, golf

	Marthas Vineyard (Massachusetts), Aug. 24: President Obama hit the links today, on the first full day of his vacation, after a morning workout and a game of tennis with his wife at the 28-acre waterfront estate he has rented for the week.        
	South Carolina Representative James E. Clyburn, UBS Investment Bank president Robert Wolf and White House aide Marvin Nicholson joined President Obama for a round of golf. White House officials declined to say which of the islands courses hosted the President.        
	You know, hes on vacation. So everything is a little bit loose, spokesman Bill Burton said at the elementary school gymnasium that is serving as the island briefing room. You know, you wake up, you have some breakfast, you work out, and then you decide: Oh, what I feel like doing today? Hes doing that just like anybody else. The President has been coming to Marthas Vineyard for about 10 years, Burton said, visiting five or six times. But while he praised the hospitality of the islands residents, he made clear that the President would keep mostly to himself.         
	Last night, the Obamas stayed at home, hosting dinner for senior adviser Valerie Jarrett and her daughter, and longtime friend Eric Whitaker and his family.        
	Hes been coming here for some 10 years now, and he plans to come back, Burton said.         
	So, hopefully, going forward there will be some opportunities for him to be out in the public. But, for right now, hes just spending a little time with his family.        
	Burton said the President also plans to get in some reading while hes on vacation, though the list of books he offered seemed ambitious for a seven-day break.         
	The reading list includes George Pelecanoss The Way Home, Richard Prices Lush Life, Tom Friedmans Hot, Flat and Crowded, David McCulloughs John Adams and Kent Harufs Plainsong.

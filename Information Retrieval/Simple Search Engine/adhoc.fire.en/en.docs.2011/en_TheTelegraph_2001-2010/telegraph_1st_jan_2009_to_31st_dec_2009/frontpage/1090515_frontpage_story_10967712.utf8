          JAYANTH JACOB                            Jayalalithaa, Bardhan: No commitment                                 
	New Delhi, May 14: A.B. Bardhan tried his best, but couldnt coax a yes from Jayalalithaa.        
	The CPI chief had a long discussion late last evening with the ADMK boss to persuade her to come for a meeting of third front partners in Delhi on May 18 but Jayalalithaa, Left sources admitted, gave no clear commitment.        
	CPM general secretary Prakash Karat had, however, said yesterday that the ADMK would attend the meeting, where leaders of the Telugu Desam, Biju Janata Dal, Janata Dal (Secular) as well as Mayavatis Bahujan Samaj Party would also be present.        
	Bardhans efforts to get a commitment from Jayalalithaa came a few hours after the former Tamil Nadu chief minister said in Chennai that she was getting feelers from many places but would prefer to wait till the results are out on May 16.        
	Today, as verdict day neared, third front parties led by the Left were back to wooing Jayalalithaa to stop her from switching sides.        
	Left sources said there was reason why they were getting worked up. The primary interest of the ADMK, they pointed out, lies in Tamil Nadu. And if the ADMK helps the Congress come to power at the Centre, just by withdrawing support, the Congress can ensure the DMK governments fall in the state.        
	The 35-member Congress now supports the DMK-led alliance in Tamil Nadu. If the Congress withdraws support, the DMKs 97 MLAs and those of its smaller allies will not be able to ensure the 118 needed for majority in the 234-member Assembly.        
	The ADMK has 60 members in the Assembly and can manage a majority with the Congress, PMK (18) and others.         
	It all depends on numbers. Power in the state is an offer the ADMK may find irresistible, said a Left leader.

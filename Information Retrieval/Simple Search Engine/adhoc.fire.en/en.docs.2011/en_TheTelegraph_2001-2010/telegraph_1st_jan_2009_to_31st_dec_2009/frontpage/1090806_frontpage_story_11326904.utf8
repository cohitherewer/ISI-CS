The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Rules for safer, sensitive hotels
                                                                                                           Rules for safer, sensitive hotels
          OUR BUREAU                              
	Aug. 5: The Centre has made it mandatory for hotels to follow guidelines intended at making them more secure, disabled-friendly and environment-conscious.        
	It has also announced a new categorisation of cities based on security perception, not revenue generation, which makes Calcutta Grade A for the hospitality industry.        
	Several of the security measures announced by the tourism ministry were already being followed by hotels in the wake of the 26/11 attacks, mostly on their own or after being advised by police. But the new directives make it binding on the hotels to enforce the measures as soon as possible.        
	For hotels with a three-star label and above, an X-ray machine at the entrance to scan baggage and closed-circuit television in their properties are mandatory. Some five-star hotels already have the system in place.        
	All hotels should post security personnel at the gates and have facilities to belly-scan vehicles. The norms direct manual checks for staff and suppliers at designated entry points. The hotels have been directed to conduct verification of staff and suppliers by the police or through private security agencies. Kitchen staff should also be trained to administer first aid.        
	Among other suggestions are peepholes allowing guests to see the corridor, internal securing devices and visual and audible emergency alarms.        
	All existing and new hotels should build entry ramps and redesign bathrooms and other facilities to be more disabled-friendly. At least one dedicated room with attached bathroom that has guide rails for the differently abled, designated parking space, designated toilets with easy access and ramps in the lobby are among the other steps recommended.        
	The hotels have been given time till September 1, 2010, to comply with the guidelines. The penalty for flouting the norms has not been specified, but sources said compliance would be needed to retain star rating.        
	Star hotels will have to harvest rainwater, control air pollution and introduce non-CFC (ozone-friendly) refrigerators and air-conditioners, energy-saving lamps and water-saving devices.        
	Officials said the Mumbai attacks and the Commonwealth Games in Delhi next year, when many foreigners are expected, have prompted the ministry to issue the directives.

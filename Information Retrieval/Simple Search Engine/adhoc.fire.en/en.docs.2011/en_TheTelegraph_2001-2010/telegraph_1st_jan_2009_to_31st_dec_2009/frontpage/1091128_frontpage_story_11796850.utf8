          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Pirakata (West Midnapore), Nov. 27: A security team returning after patrol today walked into a Maoist trap, with four explosions punctuated by rebel fire killing an officer and a constable and leaving three personnel seriously wounded.        
	Police officers cited a lapse by the team of 100 state and central personnel, saying they were returning by the same route they had left in the morning.        
	They came under attack in Pirakata, 6km from Salboni, around 2.30pm and a gun battle raged till 5pm, when the rebels fled.        
	Assistant sub-inspector Alok Mondal, 37, died on the way to hospital and state armed police (SAP) constable Srikanta Banerjee, 24, after admission. Both had been hit by shrapnel, as were the injured.        
	The ambush, 2.5km from the Pirakata camp, comes 19 days after the Maoists gunned down four Eastern Frontier Rifles jawans near the Jharkhand border.        
	A team of CRPF, India Reserve Battalion and SAP personnel had left the camp at 10am to patrol villages in Salboni. On our way back, we were walking through a dense sal forest when there were three deafening explosions ahead of us and bullets came flying from both sides, an IRB jawan said.        
	We rushed forward, took up position and returned fire. There was another explosion and five of our team were hit by splinters.        
	While the encounter was on, the forces informed the camp, from which a Sumo arrived to take the injured away.        
	The Maoists may have triggered the first three blasts to draw the security forces towards a particular place where they had planted more explosives, a police officer said.        
	It seems the Maoists saw the patrol leave in the morning, planted explosive devices and detonated them when they found them returning by the same route.        
	Mamata Banerjee said the Centre should probe who planted the explosives. I am shocked and I condemn such killings. The Centre should conduct a probe to let people know who are actually involved, she said.        
	The explosives were planted by Maoist guerrillas, said district police chief Manoj Verma.        
	The three personnel in hospital are IRB assistant sub-inspector Madhusudan Banerjee, 52; IRB jawan Mintu Haldar, 27; and SAP jawan Lakshmikanta Chakraborty, 26.        
	Both the dead are from Purulia.

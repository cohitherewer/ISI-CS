The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Jobs make a devil less evil
                                                                                                           Jobs make a devil less evil
          MUZAFFAR RAINA                               
	Baramulla, Feb. 18: For many youths of the Valley, army is no longer the reviled a-word.         
	Over the last three days, around 15,000 able-bodied Kashmiri men aged between 17 and 21 have queued up to enrol in the military, seen as the oppressor of the people in the Valley for over a decade.         
	Youths had earlier shunned the armed forces, even when their job prospects were bleak.        
	This is the biggest ever rally organised in Kashmir for recruitment. Around 15,000 youths applied for it and they came from all the 10 districts of the Valley, said army spokesman Colonel Uma Maheshwar. The last recruitment rally was in May 2006, when just 2,000 men applied.         
	The job camp, which will continue for two more days, began on February 16 at a local stadium in Baramulla, around 55km from Srinagar. Applicants will have to go through physical and written tests for selection.         
	The site is not very far from the Baramulla-Uri road, where one of the biggest pro-freedom rallies, responding to separatists call of Muzaffarabad Chalo, had snaked its way towards the Line of Control last year during the Amarnath land protests.         
	Javed Mir, a separatist leader, said such recruitment rallies would not harm his freedom struggle.         
	We have a lot of unemployment here, but the Indian government is exploiting it to unleash propaganda about how youths are joining the army. Freedom struggle is in the blood of our youths and this will not vanish even if they join the army, he said.         
	The majority of the hopefuls, many of whom have come from far, said unemployment was the biggest reason they were here. Muneeb Hassan, who has come from a village in Kupwara, almost 50km away, said: The army is the biggest employment provider in our area and so I am here to be a part of it.         
	A fresh recruit for posts like soldiers on general duty, soldier clerk, soldier nursing assistant or a store-keeper  available for recruitment at the rally  is entitled to gross emoluments of around Rs 15,000 a month. The minimum educational qualification varies with the post  from Class VIII pass to a Plus-II degree.        
	The absence of any industry makes the Jammu and Kashmir government the biggest employment provider, ensuring over 4.5 lakh jobs.        
	While the army has not been a big draw in the past, the police have remained the choice for many. The state has the highest police-population ratio in the country.

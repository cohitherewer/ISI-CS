The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Ladies in line to run the House
                                                                                                           Ladies in line to run the House
          RADHIKA RAMASESHAN                        Meira (above), Girija				                                       
	New Delhi, May 30: After its first woman President, India may get its first woman Lok Sabha Speaker.        
	The Congress has more or less decided to nominate Girija Vyas or Meira Kumar for the post, sources said, and the UPAs numerical strength makes a contest unlikely.        
	Meira, daughter of Dalit icon Jagjivan Ram, appears the front-runner over Vyas, the articulate former womens commission chief; picking a Dalit may help the Congress counter Mayavatis aura among the community.         
	Manmohan Singh and Sonia Gandhi are expected to decide tomorrow.        
	There could even be a woman deputy Speaker. According to PTI, the Prime Minister tonight called L.K. Advani and offered the post to the Opposition, and the BJPs front-runner happens to be veteran Madhya Pradesh MP Sumitra Mahajan.        
	However, the BJP had given the post to ally Akali Dal in 2004, and this time the Janata Dal (United) is expected to make a pitch.        
	If Meira makes the cut as Speaker, she will have to resign as cabinet minister for water resources, a job she had bagged just two days ago. Sources said the Prime Minister might hold the portfolio for a while or hand it to sulking Balasore MP Srikant Jena.        
	Jena, upset with his minister-of-state post after holding a cabinet berth in the United Front government, is yet to assume office and is believed to be out of Delhi.        
	Having a woman Speaker would bring to its logical conclusion an abiding theme of Election 2009. Not only did Mamata Banerjee, Mayavati and Jayalalithaa join Sonia in the limelight, but the results threw up a record 59 women MPs, 10 more than the previous best in 1999.        
	Sources said Manmohan and Sonia were reluctant to let this historic opportunity go, having already helped the country beat America to a woman President in 2007. A repeat, however, is not possible, the US having already elected Nancy Pelosi Speaker of the House of Representatives.        
	The closest India came to having a woman Speaker was in 1998, when the NDA had toyed with the idea of appointing Sushma Swaraj. But ally Telugu Desam scuttled the plan by seeking the post in return for support to the government.        
	The state legislatures have had women Speakers, though. Punjab elected the first, Shano Devi, the daughter of a freedom fighter; and the Telugu Desam gave the Andhra Pradesh Assembly a woman presiding officer in Kavali Pratibha Bharathi.        
	The Lok Sabha meets from June 1 for a nine-day session with two main agendas: swearing the MPs in and electing a Speaker and a deputy Speaker.         
	President Pratibha Patil will address both Houses on June 4 after which the Rajya Sabha will be convened.        
	Till yesterday, the Congresss choice for Speaker appeared to be Andhra MP Kishore Chandra Deo, who had chaired the Lok Sabha panel that looked into the cash-for-votes scam that preceded the July 2008 trust vote.         
	But the party apparently had second thoughts after the BJP informally indicated to Congress leaders that it thought Raos report was biased against the Opposition.        
	Congress sources said that in the absence of any immediate challenge from the Opposition, the partys main objective was to ensure the House functioned smoothly.        
	We do not want to start by riling the BJP. If they are inclined to co-operate with us, we should reciprocate the sentiment in whatever manner we can, a source said.        
	Even the choice of the previous Speaker was a first  no communist party MP had held the post before Somnath Chatterjee.        
	Many are wondering how the soft-spoken Meira, if she occupies the chair, would cope with the inevitable chaos and din even if the BJP promises to be on its best behaviour.        
	One incentive, however, could be the chance to show that women can run the House better.

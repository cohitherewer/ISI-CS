	Sayra Bibi  
	How her day started   
	Sayra Bibi wakes up at 4am, offers namaaz. On election day, she prays for her husbands departed soul. Does household chores  
	Was she looking forward to this day?   
	Yes. Because I want to avenge my husbands death by defeating the CPM. My husband lost his life because of the land war. I hope the CPM loses, then at least Ill get some peace  
	Another day but different too   
	Around 6.30am, Sayra Bibi has muri and tea with her four children. She then opens the tea shop she runs next to her house. Makes tea for the polling personnel of her booth, 200 yards from her house  
	Stepping out   
	Before leaving for the booth at 7.10am, she tells her children: Pray that I can vote peacefully so that the CPM can be defeated. At least then, your fathers soul can rest in peace  
	On her way   
	I consider myself lucky to be alive and around to cast my vote, she says. I consider it providence that my children are all alive despite the attacks of the CPM goons  
	Fellow voters  
	 Sayra Bibi meets a few other women from the same village on their way to the booth. They embrace each other  
	The vote and after   
	A mission accomplished, she declares after voting at 7.20am. I am so relieved that I have been able to vote for my candidate. I am happy that there has been no violence in this booth and I have been able to cast my vote in peace  
	Will her vote make a difference?  
	 It will make a huge difference as the person I have voted for will definitely win, Sayra Bibi says. This will be a fitting reply to the CPM  
	What if her candidate loses  
	 I am confident that my candidate will win, she says. There is no doubt. If for any reason he does not, I will only curse my fate  
	What now?  
	 This evening, Ill pray for my candidate, hope that he wins, Sayra Bibi says. But tomorrow will be a normal day for me. Ill wait for the results now.              Age: 23
  Village: Gopalnagar, Singur 
  Occupation: Trainee technician at Tata Motors plant in Pantnagar
  Loss: Used to work at the Nano plant in Singur. The Rs 1,700 he got a month sustained him in Singur, but tough to make ends meet in Pantnagar      
	Raj Kumar Jyoti  
	How his day started   
	Jyoti wakes up at 6.30am, has tea, walks to nearby Sahanapara and buys a newspaper. Flipping through it, he chats with some friends. Returns home, changes and leaves again for Sahanapara, where his friends are waiting  
	Was he looking forward to this day?  
	 Yes. The dreams that I had been building crashed around me. This is why I have taken leave and come to Singur to vote for the CPM. I think we have been cheated by the Trinamul people. I was getting two free meals besides my salary. I was quite happy  
	Stepping out   
	Jyoti catches up with friends on the situation in Singur. He asks them whether they had visited the Tata plant administrative office that is still functioning. They say there is no positive news of the Nano returning. Jyoti snacks on muri and ghugni before setting out to vote around 2pm. He walks to his booth, located in Gopalnagar  
	On his way  
	 The thought uppermost in my mind today is that there should be some hope that industry will come up in Singur. I see only desolation here. But I want to come back to Bengal, to my home in Singur, says Jyoti  
	Fellow voters  
	 Jyoti runs into his uncle, Asit, on way to the booth, and Somnath Das, his batchmate at the Tata plant. My uncle told me to vote for the CPM, Jyoti says. I assured him that there was no need to tell me that. This time the vote is for industry in Singur  
	The vote and after  
	 After I voted, my thoughts went back to the four months that I had spent in the Nano plant in Singur, Jyoti says. There was food at home and hardly a worry  
	Will his vote make a difference?  
	 I do hope that my vote will make a difference. My vote could ensure a return to the days of hope in Singur. Drops of water make a sea  
	What if his candidate loses   
	My candidate will never lose, Jyoti says. But what Im not certain about is if the Singur Assembly segment can give him a big lead  
	What now?  
	 Ill discuss the polls with my friends in the evening.      REPORTING: IMRAN AHMED SIDDIQUI IN NANDIGRAM AND KINSUK BASU IN SINGUR.

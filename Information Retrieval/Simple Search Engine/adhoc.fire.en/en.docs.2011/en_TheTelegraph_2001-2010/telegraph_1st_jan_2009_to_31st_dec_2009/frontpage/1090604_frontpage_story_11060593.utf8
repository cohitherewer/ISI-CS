  - Bimal sticks to stand but agrees to attend Delhi talks           OUR BUREAU                            Gurung at a media conference at Writers Buildings.   Picture by Amit Datta                                              
	June 3: Chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee today shot down the Gorkha Janmukti Morcha demand for a three-tier panchayat system in the DGHC area and instead asked them to revive the two-tier system, the elections to which have not been held since 2000.        
	 The DGHC is still there and I cannot stop elections to the Siliguri Mahakuma Parishad. Their demand for a three-tier panchayat system is not possible, the chief minister said after a meeting with a Morcha delegation at Writers Buildings today.         
	However, it is positive (sign) that they are wanting to hold elections. I also requested them to allow the municipal polls to take place in the hills, the chief minister said.        
	The seven-member Morcha team led by its president Bimal Gurung met Bhattacharjee mainly to discuss the rescue and relief operations in the landslide-hit hills that saw the death of 28 persons on May 26. Amar Lama, a central committee member of the Morcha, told The Telegraph: The state government strongly believes that we are trying to reinforce our territory and is bent on not meeting our demand.         
	Observers said the demand for a three-tier system was largely to correct Subash Ghisinghs mistake to confine the DGHC administrative area to the hills. After the formation of the DGHC in 1988, the state government was quick to form the Mahakuma Parishad as the administrative unit for the plains in Darjeeling district.         
	Since the Constitution of India stands for only one zilla parishad for each district, a fulfilment of the Morcha demand would mean an amendment to the law. As far as the statehood demand was concerned, the chief minister told the delegation to participate in the tripartite talks. Gurung told reporters that the BJP MP from Darjeeling, Jaswant Singh, who took oath in the Lok Sabha today, would raise the demand for Gorkhaland in Parliament. We are participating in the Delhi talks to resume soon. We will take part in the elections only if there is a three-tier panchayat system.         
	The chief minister said Rs 4 lakh each would be handed over to the next of kin of those who died in the cyclone fury.

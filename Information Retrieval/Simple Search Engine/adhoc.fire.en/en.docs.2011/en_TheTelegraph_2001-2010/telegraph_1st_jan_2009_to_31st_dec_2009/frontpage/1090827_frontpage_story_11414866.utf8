	Washington, Aug. 26: Even in death, the Kennedys chart Americas political agenda. The passing away of Edward M. Kennedy, the last of a generation of Kennedys who held America and much of the world in thrall for half-a-century, will slow down, if not altogether stymie, President Barack Obamas most ambitious initiative: affordable health care for all Americans.        
	Obama needs 60 votes in the procedure-centric US Senate to pass his health care reforms as they are evolving in the face of determined opposition from a coalition of Republicans, conservatives and the cash-rich insurance industry. With the death of Kennedy, the third longest serving member of the US Senate, the Democrats have only 59 votes, one short to prevent a process known as filibuster that can indefinitely delay most votes in the legislative chamber.         
	Kennedys last political act a few weeks ago was to write to legislators in his home state of Massachusetts urging them to change the state law and authorise the governor of Massachusetts, a fellow Democrat, to nominate a successor, should a vacancy occur in the Senate, a reflection on his coming death.        
	His concern was that without his 60th vote in the Senate, health care reform  the cause of my life, Kennedy called it  would be delayed and possibly diluted or derailed.         
	Legislators in Massachusetts vacillated, worried about criticism that the law was being changed to suit politics. But today, one day too late, they were huddled, examining whether they could still do what Kennedy asked for and overcome the biggest challenge yet to the Obama presidency.         
	Few people remember that Kennedy, whose legacy is built around his struggles for Americans on domestic issues, made one of his rare and early forays into foreign policy in Calcutta and eastern India.         
	Although he was heir to the Kennedy legacy after the tragic assassinations of his two older brothers, in 1971 Edward Kennedy was still relatively junior in the Senate, where seniority is sacrosanct.         
	He was chairman of only an obscure sub-committee on refugees that reported to the main Judiciary Committee of the chamber when the crackdown in East Pakistan began after the election victory of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman.         
	Casting aside his reticence then to wade into foreign policy, Kennedy visited the camps in India where refugees from East Pakistan were being given shelter.         
	He publicised the reign of terror by the Pakistani army in what later became Bangladesh by describing the plight of refugees who had come to India as one of the most appalling tides of human misery in modern times.        
	Then US President Richard Nixon and the architect of Nixons policy in South Asia, Henry Kissinger, were solidly backing Pakistan against the breaking away of East Pakistan.        
	Kennedy elevated his Senate sub-committee into prominence by holding hearings about the problems of refugees who were flooding eastern India.         
	It was only after these hearings on Capitol Hill that drew attention across the US to a developing humanitarian catastrophe in South Asia that Nixon and Kissinger agreed to send any significant food aid to refugees from East Pakistan and somewhat softened their pro-Pakistan stand at the UN.         
	Kennedy acknowledged Indias rise in recent years and had a keen awareness of its importance, but unlike many fair-weather colleagues of his on Capitol Hill, he never chased Indian American money. Nor was he taken in by any hype about India that is now common in the US.         
	As a result, he remained a distant friend of India, a friend nevertheless who did not jump on the bandwagon of cheerleaders for New Delhi on Capitol Hill.        
	Kennedy never wavered in his long-held, principled positions on issues: his positions were not altered by lobbying campaigns or expediency that resulted in changes in US foreign policy.        
	An example was the Indo-US nuclear deal, over which Kennedy had serious reservations as someone who was a life-long proponent of nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation.        
	In November 2006, Kennedy voted in the Senate in favour of a killer amendment to the nuclear deal that would have required the US President to certify that New Delhi was maintaining a cap on its fissile material production before orders for export of nuclear equipment to India could be executed.         
	Another senator who then voted for this failed amendment  which would have killed the nuclear deal  was Barack Obama, who has since changed his mind and is going ahead with the deal in its present form.         
	As fate would have it, Kennedy did not have to vote against the nuclear deal in its final stage in the Senate and be cast in Indian eyes as being unfriendly for that reason.         
	He was the only senator who was absent from the chamber when the nuclear deal went for its final vote in 2008. By that time he was already diagnosed with his brain tumour and had stopped going to Capitol Hill except for very crucial votes.        
	Although he remained largely aloof from India and Indian Americans during this decade of closer Indo-US relations, most people of Indian origin here view the Kennedy family as a mirror image of the Nehru-Gandhi political dynasty back in their native country.        
	The two dynasties shared similar heartbreaks, identical tragedies  assassinations by gunmen, Sanjay Gandhis and JFK juniors plane crash  and a total sway over their people.         
	Kennedy won his last election to the Senate in 2006 with a landslide securing a phenomenal 69.3 per cent of votes. At the lowest point in his long career, after a fatal accident at Chappaquiddick that Kennedy did not immediately report, he won re-election with as much as 62 per cent of the vote.         
	Any inheritor of the Kennedy familys political legacy will have a long trek to grow into his shoes. But by those standards, Indias first dynasty in public life appears secure and poised to outlive the Kennedys.        
	Mourning Kennedy and vowing to continue his fight for health care reform under Obama, his supporters were tonight quoting from a speech by Martin Luther King Jr., which applies to the late senators unfinished goal.        
	I have seen the promised land. I may not get there with you. But I want you to know tonight that we, as a people, will get to the promised land.

          OUR BUREAU                              
	Jamshedpur/Gidhni, Dec. 30: Movement of trains on the Howrah-Mumbai via Tatanagar route was severely affected today after suspected Maoists yanked out about 400 metres of railway tracks near Jhargram early in the morning. A big accident, however, was averted as two railway patrolmen spotted the damage and alerted authorities.         
	Hundreds of lives were saved as the New Delhi-Bhubaneswar Purushottam Express, that was supposed to pass within 10 minutes, was stopped at Gidhni station, about 10km from the damaged tracks.        
	A senior railway officer said the track patrolmen were checking the 14-km stretch between Jhargram and Gidhni in the wee hours when they heard shouts and loud thuds from the tracks ahead.         
	After walking a few minutes, they saw around 150 people hammering away at the railway tracks near Jharageria village, about 4km from Jhargram. The rebels along with a large number of villagers were busy opening the pandrol clips and hammering the tracks out of shape along a 200-metre stretch on both the Up and Down lines. The pandrol clips hold the tracks to the sleepers.        
	The two patrolmen immediately informed the station authorities at Gidhni and Jhargram over their walkie talkies.        
	The incident spot, in Kharagpur division, is 16km away from Banstala, where Naxalites held the Bhubaneshwar-New Delhi Rajdhani Express hostage for over five hours on October 27.         
	Though no rebel outfit had claimed responsibility, intelligence sources said it was the handiwork of Peoples Committee against Police Atrocities (PCAPA), a pro-rebel outfit active in the area.         
	Immediately after the damage was detected, South Eastern Railways sounded an alert in Kharagpur and Chakradharpur divisions. Subsequently, all trains moving in both divisions were short terminated at different stations.         
	 The Hatia-Howrah Express was detained for several hours at Tatanagar railway station, while the Mumbai Mail was held up at Ghatshila. The Sambleshwari Express and Bhubaneshwar-New Delhi Sampark Kranti Express were terminated at Chakulia and Kandra railway stations respectively.         
	About half a dozen long distance trains including Howrah-Ahmedabad Express, Chennai-Guwahati Express and Puri-Nizamuddin Utkal Express were diverted from Kharagpur.         
	The Tata-Howrah Steel Express had to be cancelled this morning as normal traffic could not be restored by 6am. The train leaves Tatanagar at 6.10 am. Two other trains  Tata- Howrah Passenger (348) and Tata-Kharagpur Passenger (354) also had to be cancelled. Normal traffic on the Down line was restored at 7.30am while the services on the Up line were restored at 8, said A K Agarwal, station manager of Tatanagar. The Howrah-Barbil Janshatabdi Express reached Tatanagar an hour late, while the Howrah-Sambalpur Ispat Express was delayed by 40 minutes.

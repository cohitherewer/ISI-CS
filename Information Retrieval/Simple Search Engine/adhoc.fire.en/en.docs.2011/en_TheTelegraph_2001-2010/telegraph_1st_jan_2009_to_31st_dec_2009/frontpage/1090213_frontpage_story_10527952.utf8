  - Firms hopeful on Day 1 of project review          SUMAN K. SRIVASTAVA                            Razi nod to faster clearance                                        
	Ranchi, Feb. 12: Investors who have pledged mega steel and power projects in the state must have been relieved today when they were promised that land acquisition, the primary bottleneck facing most, would now be put on the fast track in Centrally-administered Jharkhand.        
	On Day One of the review meeting held today at the intervention of Governor Syed Sibte Razi, the state industries department asked deputy commissioners (DCs) to expedite land acquisition for industries across the state.        
	In turn, the department asked each investor to prepare a dossier on the rehabilitation package for each family likely to be displaced by its project in tune with the state rehabilitation amp; relief policy (R amp;R).         
	They have been asked to take the help of the district administration in this endeavour.         
	At the end of todays deliberations, held between officials and senior representatives of seven investing companies, industries director Rahul Sharma admitted the pace of land acquisition had been slow.        
	We have asked DCs to take up the issue on a priority basis, he told The Telegraph and added that other issues like water, coal and iron ore linkages were being cleared under the standard procedure.         
	Sharma said the R amp;R policy, cleared by the state government in August 2008, had been implemented. In fact, several companies had promised a lot more than what was specified in the policy.        
	The companies that held one-on-one meetings with the team of officials drawn from various state departments, included ArcelorMittal, Jindal Steel amp; Power Ltd, RPG -owned CESC Limited, Jharkhand Ispat, JSW Steels, Hindalco and Electro Steel Ltd.        
	The industries department circulated a three-page questionnaire among them, seeking every detail about their projects.         
	Over the next two days, the department will hold meetings with 13 other mega investors, including Tata Steel, to review their progress and find out how the administration could help.                    
	The three-day exercise was undertaken after Razi swung into action on the SoS from various investors seeking his intervention on clearances and other bottlenecks that have slowed down their projects in the politically unstable state.        
	CESCs senior representative Sanjeev Sengupta said the power plant, to be set up in Santhal Pargana, had received all mandatory clearances, except the land.         
	 He pointed out that a set of NGOs was creating hurdles in most of the projects. So, the government should take an initiative and invite them for talks to end the stalemate, he said.         
	 Industries secretary N.N. Sinha assured Sengupta of prompt action.        
	ArcelorMittal representatives, including Sanak Mishra, M.P. Singh and P.S. Prasad, also sought the active involvement of the administration in speeding up land acquisition.         
	It was a positive and fruitful initiative where officials of all relevant departments, including energy, water resources, land revenue were present. And they were all given directives. Now, it is for us to follow up, said a senior company representative.        
	JSW CEO R.P. Singh suggested the government hand out a demand note for 900 acres of gair majarua land and a clearance to buy 4,400 acres of non-tribal land to set up their unit _ a proposed 10MTPA steel plant. .        
	 I have promised to begin construction within three months of getting land, he said.        
	Sharma, when asked whether the administration would invite agitators for talks, said project specific problems could be sorted out at the district administration level. We will also intervene if we think it is necessary, he added.

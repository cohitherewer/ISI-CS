          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Cuttack, Aug. 27: In an unprecedented ruling, Orissa High Court today directed the government to pay a monthly relief of Rs 1,500 to both the father and the mother of a convict, who died while serving a sentence at Choudwar circle jail, for the rest of their lives.        
	A small-time farmer Chaityana Behera, 71, and Labani, 60, have been living in penury since their son died. Chaitanyas right hand, right from the shoulder, was amputated after a malignant tumour spread.         
	Krushna Chandra Behera, 43, of Nurukesabarini village in Badamba area of Cuttack, was sentenced for life in a case of dowry death in 2003. He died on June 10, 2008, after another jail convict stabbed him. His parents demanded social security of Rs 10 lakh. A two-judge bench said the government should pay Rs 1,500 each to Krushnas father and mother before the 10th each month.        
	Perhaps for the first time a court has awarded lifetime relief, said the petitioners counsel Amulya Kumar Budhia.              
	 In such cases courts generally award a one-time compensation, he added.         
	Holding jail officers prima facie guilty for the death, the court said that the state was duty bound to protect the fundamental rights of prisoners.        
	Krushna was stabbed by Pratap Khatei, a lifer, with a broken steel utensil (karchuli) used to serve food. He was found bleeding from his stomach near a jail lavatory in ward number-19 around 8.15pm on June 9.        
	The lifer was shifted to SCB Medical College and Hospital after preliminary medical attention and was declared dead around 9.05am in the emergency ward. He had suffered lung ruptures. Later, unconfirmed reports of a tiff between the two surfaced.

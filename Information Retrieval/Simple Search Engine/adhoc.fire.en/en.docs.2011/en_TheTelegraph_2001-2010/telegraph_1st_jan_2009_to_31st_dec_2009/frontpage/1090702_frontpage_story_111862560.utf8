          OUR BUREAU      New Delhi Jul 2 (PTI): The Delhi High Court today legalised gay sex among consenting adults in a path breaking judgement, holding that the law making it a criminal offence violates fundamental rights.   However, Section 377 of the Indian Penal Code, which criminalises homosexuality, will continue for non-consensual and non-vaginal sex.   A Bench comprising Chief Justice A P Shah and Justice S Murlidhar said, ldquo;We declare section 377 of IPC in so far as it criminalises consensual sexual acts of adults in private is violative of Articles 14, 21 and 15 of the Constitution, rdquo; The High Court said ldquo;the provision of section 377 IPC will continue to govern non-consensual penile non-vaginal sex and penile non vaginal sex involving minors rdquo;. The court clarified that ldquo;by adults we mean everyone who is 18 years of age or above rdquo;. It further said that this judgement will hold till Parliament chooses to amend the law. 	 rdquo;

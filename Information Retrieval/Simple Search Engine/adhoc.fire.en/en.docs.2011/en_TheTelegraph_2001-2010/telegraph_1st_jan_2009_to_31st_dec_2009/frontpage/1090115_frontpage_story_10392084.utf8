The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Kashmiri bother for Bips
                                                                                                           Kashmiri bother for Bips
          MUZAFFAR RAINA                            Bipasha: Role trouble                                  
	Srinagar, Jan. 14: Aasiya Andrabi, Jammu and Kashmirs hardline woman separatist leader, has served notice on the director of a film in which Bipasha Basu is purportedly playing her.        
	The Dukhtaran-e-Milat chairperson has alleged that Lamha director Rahul Dholakia violated their agreement that the script would be shown to her before shooting began.        
	Aasiya has served a legal notice on G.S. Entertainment under whose banner Dholakia is making the film, objecting to purported attempts to portray her. The entertainment house has been given three days to reply to the notice and furnish the script.        
	Dholakia said he had not received the notice. But I can tell you Bipashas role in my film is not even remotely connected with the life of Aasiya Andrabi.        
	The notice says Aasiya is a political leader and firm believer of Islam and remains always veiled and her portrayal is incompatible with her virtues and teachings.        
	The entertainment house has put her reputation, honour and dignity at stake, which is irreparable and could not be compensated, it reads.        
	Failing to comply with the advice tendered above, my client will be constrained to take appropriate legal action against you in a court of competent jurisdiction, at your own risk and cost.        
	Aasiya has referred to a meeting between her and Dholakia where it was agreed that the script of the picture will be made available to Aasiya before making the film.        
	Unfortunately the script was not made available despite several reminders.         
	At the peak of the Amarnath agitation, Bipasha had stormed out of the shoot, citing threat to her life. The shooting was repeatedly disrupted after crowd frenzy over the alleged misrepresentation of the Kashmir movement.        
	Dholakia had clarified that his film was pro-Kashmir but the disruptions continued. He resumed shooting last week.

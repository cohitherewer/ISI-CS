          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                               
	Mumbai, Dec. 29: Millions of retail investors who were diddled out of share allotments because of the infamous IPO scam between 2003 and 2005 have been promised compensation under a process recommended by a Sebi-appointed committee.        
	This is the first time that an attempt is being made to compensate retail investors who have been victims of scams.        
	The committee suggested that the market regulator could consider dipping into frozen bank and demat accounts of unscrupulous financiers who had cornered the shares through an army of bogus investors.         
	The 21 IPOs included those floated by TCS, Jet Airways, Suzlon Energy, NTPC and Yes Bank. These companies were unwitting victims and face no charges.        
	The panel estimated the unjust enrichment at Rs 95.69 crore. The frozen bank and demat accounts together hold Rs 149.06 crore, which more than covers the sum involved.         
	But the big problem is identifying the genuine retail investors who deserve to be compensated.        
	The committees elaborate scheme to compensate retail investors for the loss of opportunity could be mired in a legal swamp even if the market regulator chooses to accept it.

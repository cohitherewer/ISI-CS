The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | In Church versus communist state, party clings to two idols
                                                                                                           In Church versus communist state, party clings to two idols
          MANINI CHATTERJEE                             A Way of the Cross procession in Thiruvananthapuram, the capital of Kerala, on Good Friday. Picture by Haris Kuttipuram                                   
	Kottayam, April 11: There is a gentleness about him that is almost serene. Even when he first entered the Lok Sabha in 1984, the adjective firebrand  usually reserved for the young and the radical  was seldom used to describe CPM MP Suresh Kurup.        
	He was articulate when necessary but never made a spectacle of himself, and even four terms in the Lok Sabha did not change his understated persona or make him enamoured of power and publicity.         
	K.S. Manoj, who was elected to Parliament for the first time in 2004 is equally low-profile. Although he has asked 335 questions in the House, participated in 203 discussions and moved six private members bills, he remains unknown in Delhis power circuit and media circles  he is as quiet and unassuming, if much younger, than Kurup.        
	But if the CPM has a fighting chance in the central Kerala region this time, it is largely thanks to the immense grassroots popularity of Kurup in Kottayam and Manoj in adjoining Alleppey (Alappuzha).        
	The shops are all closed, the streets deserted and the churches are overflowing when we first enter Kottayam town on Good Friday. There is a palpable sense of piety in the air as people throng every church for special prayers and in the evening take out solemn Way of the Cross processions in memory of Christs journey to Calvary before being crucified.        
	Kottayam lies in the heart of Keralas Christian belt  a region spread between the spice-laden hills adjoining Tamil Nadu and the coastal towns of Kochi and Alleppey bang in the middle of the state. This is rubber country, and it has made some people very rich  luxurious red tile-roofed bungalows built in faux traditional style with SUVs parked under the porch reflect an in-your-face prosperity that surpasses south Mumbai or south Delhi.        
	But they are a minority, and the bulk of the population comprise agricultural workers, plantation labourers, small farmers and fisherfolk (in the coastal areas) who have been a traditional support base of the CPM.        
	This time, however, the communists are facing their toughest battle in this region because the Church  the Catholic Church in particular  has come out openly against the LDF.        
	Never since 1959, when the clergy-led Liberation movement led to the dismissal of the EMS Namboodiripad government by the Centre, has the Church been quite as vocal in Kerala politics.        
	The provocation was the bill passed by the Kerala Assembly in 2006 to regulate and monitor the functioning of self-financing educational institutions to stop them from charging exorbitant fees. Since a large number of the private engineering and medical colleges under the self-financing rubric are run by Christian bodies, the bill led to vociferous protests by the Church which has challenged it in the courts.        
	Although the bill was passed unanimously, Church leaders hold the communists primarily responsible for pushing it.         
	Father Philip Nelpuraparambil, who is the secretary of both the Kerala Catholic Bishops Council for Education and the Inter Church Council for Education, did not mince words when he told The Telegraph today: The education Act passed in 2006 is a way of denying minorities the right to establish and run educational institutions which is guaranteed by the Constitution. We have to fight it and that is why we have called for the defeat of the LDF.         
	Apart from the illegal Act, the Church is also against the LDF because of its attempts to indoctrinate the young against religion and to split the Church along class lines, he said, referring to primary school textbooks which allegedly promote atheism and see the history of Kerala only through the prism of class war.         
	The Catholic Church is taking the lead but innumerable other denominations (Jacobites, Marthomites, Malankara Orthodox and the Church of South India) that hold sway in the state are also against the LDF this time, insists Father Nelpuraparambil.        
	Politburo member S. Ramachandra Pillai says that only a section of the Church is against the LDF but it happens to be a very vocal section. To this, the Catholic priest counters: Our people are very educated and informed. They have been told of the crisis we face. It is not necessary to speak out at the time of elections.         
	Not every Christian will follow the Churchs diktat. Yet, coupled with the undercurrent of anti-incumbency, the vocal campaign by the clerics has dimmed the prospects of the LDF in a number of seats in this region.         
	That is why the tale of Kurup and Manoj is particularly interesting. Cadre-based parties insist that the organisation is all, the individual counts for nothing. But in Kottayam, almost everyone we meet  even those who admit to being anti-LDF  is full of praise for Kurups simplicity and accessibility.        
	Kurup, typically, does not make much of it himself. If there is no Parliament session, I am always there in my constituency, he says, adding: Whatever little I can do, I have done.         
	It is the little things, we discover, that ordinary voters want.         
	Sriresh, an auto driver in the town, says that Kurup is popular because anyone can go to him at any time for any little help. This could be a signature on a passport application, a recommendation for an education loan, a shoulder to cry on at a funeral or participation in local festivities.         
	With his MPLADS fund, he has provided computers to all the government and government-aided high schools in his constituency and focused on solving the drinking water problem that blights the district.         
	Manoj, a doctor by profession, treated the poor for free and was active in the youth wing of the Latin Catholic Church to which he belonged when he first came to the notice of the CPM.        
	The party decided to field the peoples doctor in 2004 and he won by a whisker against Congress rival V.M. Sudheeran (not least because a namesake Sudheeran, allegedly propped by the Left, bagged 7,000 votes).         
	But in the last five years he has acquired the reputation of being a true peoples representative as well, far beyond the boundaries of Alleppey. Like Kurup, his USP is that he is always available to his constituents. His big achievement is getting the Centre to sanction a virology institute here  saving a long trip to Pune for patients who are frequently victims of dengue and chikungunya that blight the area.        
	Neither Kurup nor Manoj fits into the media-driven stereotype of the ugly politician and neither are they inclined to become media celebrities who thrive on telegenic profiles and savvy sound bites.        
	But as K. Suresh, a shopkeeper, put it: (They are) in the hearts of the people; not in newspapers and television channels. Even if neither wins, they can take heart from this heart-felt compliment.

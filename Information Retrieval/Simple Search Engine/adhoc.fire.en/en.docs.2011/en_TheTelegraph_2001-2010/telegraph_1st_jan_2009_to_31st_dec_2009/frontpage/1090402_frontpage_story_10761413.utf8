The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | IIM-A faculty sop on hit list 
                                                                                                           IIM-A faculty sop on hit list 
          BASANT RAWAT                               
	Ahmedabad, April 1: Cut to IIM-A. The dreaded three-letter word has reached the business school.        
	Faculty members of the Indian Institute of Management in Ahmedabad have been told that their financial incentive, commonly known as free allowance, could be rolled back as the school has been hit by the global downturn.        
	Director Samir Barua is learnt to have conveyed this to the faculty, reasoning that the institutes earnings had gone down owing to the economic condition the world over. If implemented, the faculty members stand to lose around Rs 4.5 lakh per year.        
	Barua could not be reached for comment.         
	IIM-A spokesperson Ishita Solanki confirmed the move, but said it was still under consideration. The proposal is at a discussion stage. A formal circular has to be issued for it to be implemented and we are yet to decide on that, Solanki said.         
	In 2005, then director Bakul Dholakia had introduced the scheme under which faculty members were allowed to keep the first Rs 10 lakh they earned as consultancy fees every year, which they were not required to share with the institute. The remaining amount would be shared between the faculty member and the institute on a 55:45 basis.         
	But last week, citing recession and pay revision, Barua told the faculty council that he was going to reverse his predecessors decision, said sources privy to the discussions. This implies that faculty members will have to share with the institute the Rs 10 lakh they could have kept for themselves, which works out to a loss of Rs 4.5 lakh annually.        
	Faculty members are allowed to engage in consultancy work 52 days a year when they advise corporate houses. The sources said the members charge between Rs 80,000 and Rs 1.5 lakh a day for this.        
	The sources said Barua cited two reasons for the decision. One, following the sixth pay commission recommendations, there had been a substantial rise in the salary of faculty members. Two, because of the downturn, the institutes corpus had been depleted.        
	Faculty members disputed the second argument, saying the institute had been earning handsomely from various executive programmes. For example, the fee for a one-year PGP executive programme is Rs 20 lakh.        
	Nearly 80 per cent of the faculty members are involved in consultancy, which continues to fetch the institute a substantial amount of money.         
	An administrator, who did not wish to be named, justified the move to roll back the allowance. We have to be flexible keeping in mind the demand of the times. Even CEOs are forgoing bonuses, the administrator said.        
	A senior professor said the allowance had sought to ensure that faculty members did not leave for greener pastures unless the offer came with a package of over Rs 30 lakh per annum.         
	The seniormost IIM professors, with experience of over 10 years, draw yearly salary packages of around Rs 12-15 lakh. The incentive of Rs 10 lakh was a huge bonus, the professor said.        
	Another professor said the faculty members could now look for job options. Most Indian institutes insist on the faculty sharing the consultancy fee. A few foreign schools and universities are more magnanimous: most allow the faculty to retain the entire fee and charge a small percentage as overhead cost, others allow faculty to launch companies for consultancy work.        
	Those who can leave will certainly leave, the professor said.

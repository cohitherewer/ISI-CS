          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Calcutta, July 16: The Bengal government today announced that it would not proceed with a showpiece highway project assigned to the Salim Group and washed its hands of land acquisition, signalling the burial of the re-industrialisation effort that was on life support since Nandigram and Singur.        
	The proposed 108km highway was intended to connect Barasat in North 24-Parganas to Raichak in South 24-Parganas. The highway would have helped link Dum Dum airport and Haldia port without break. Several clusters of amenities and shops and a township at the Haldia end were also part of the now-shelved proposal.         
	The government is not proceeding with the Salim Groups highway project connecting Barasat to Raichak. The decision was taken following a discussion with the chief minister, finance minister Asim Dasgupta told the Assembly.        
	Dasguptas assertion confirmed what was already seen as a distinct possibility. The state government had failed to acquire any land for the project in the face of mounting opposition from the Trinamul Congress which now controls the zilla parishad in South 24-Parganas and has emerged as a force to reckon with in North 24-Parganas after winning all five Lok Sabha seats.        
	Told about the governments announcement, Prasoon Mukherjee, director of New Kolkata International Development, a partner of the Salim Group, expressed surprise.        
	We are surprised. This was not known to us. I do not know how one of the parties can take a decision when there is an agreement signed between the Bengal government and us, Mukherjee said.        
	A consolation for the government came from Changi Airport International which announced a $20-million investment in an airport township project in Burdwans Andal where the Trinamul Congress appeared to be in favour of the project. ( )        
	The second announcement made by Dasgupta was less surprising, though it brought out the contradictions within the government. Investors will have to buy land directly from the farmers. If they are in need of a small portion, the government can help, he said.        
	The announcement itself is not new but it appeared to contradict what industries minister Nirupam Sen said this week while presenting his departments budget. The states intervention was essential when a large quantum of land was involved. This is because the government cant allow landowners or farmers to be left at the mercy of land sharks, Sen had said.        
	The highway project is the second big initiative associated with the Indonesia-based Salim Group in Bengal that is running into trouble.         
	The chemical hub project in Nandigram was shifted to Nayachar after the initiation of the land acquisition process triggered a backlash that changed the face of Bengal politics. At least five other projects, ranging from infrastructure to motorcycle manufacturing, involving the Salim Group are mostly at the early stages in the state.        
	Several Calcutta-based industrialists described the governments decision to scrap the highway project as unfortunate.        
	 The cancellation of the Raichak-Barasat expressway is really unfortunate. That was needed for the betterment of the states physical infrastructure. But regarding the governments move on land acquisition, this should be the way. Industry should buy land directly from the owners and the government could act as a facilitator, said Vishambhar Saran, the president of the Indian Chamber of Commerce.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Leap in airline safety fine
                                                                                                           Leap in airline safety fine
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                            Stiff penalty                                  
	New Delhi, May 10: The next time an aircrafts nose-wheel collapses on the tarmac, as happened in Mumbai last month, the airline could be fined Rs 10 lakh and an errant executive jailed for two years.        
	Under new rules on aircraft safety and passenger comfort that came into effect today, even neglecting passengers plight during flight delays can attract punishment, aviation officials said.        
	Earlier, airlines faced a paltry fine of Rs 1,000 for violating or neglecting safety norms, and the officials responsible were liable to be jailed only for six months  that too on paper.        
	Till date in India, airlines have never been held to have wilfully compromised on safety, directorate-general of civil aviation (DGCA) officials said. Which is why, no one has ever been jailed in the country for airline safety violations.        
	However, we are now bringing in a graded punishment norm which includes both fines and jail terms for the airline executives responsible, usually operating officers who are found to have wilfully neglected safety norms, an official said.        
	The new rules, notified by the government last night, are based on amendments to the Aircraft Act 1934, passed by Parliament sometime ago.        
	Penalty for flying so as to cause danger. Whoever wilfully flies any aircraft in such a manner as to cause danger to any person or to any property on land or water or in the air shall be punishable with imprisonment for a term which may extend to two years, or with fine which may extend to ten lakh rupees, or with both, the notification says.        
	Pilots unions  including the Indian Commercial Pilots Association, Indian Pilots Guild and the Society for Welfare of Indian Pilots  had been urging the government to come out with stricter norms and force airlines to pay more attention to aircraft safety.        
	The DGCA too had been worried by the spate of recent mishaps. Only a week ago, a tow tractor had tried to move an Air India aircraft while it was still attached to an aero-bridge at Mumbai airport.        
	While some of these incidents involved human error, there were fears that some airlines might be compromising on safety because of the financial crunch the industry faces. Indian carriers are expected to post a combined loss of Rs 8,000 crore this year.        
	Airline executives point out that aviation in India is no longer a small community where everyone knows everyone else but has expanded into a big industry. Some of the large number of operators may not be maintaining the required safety standards.

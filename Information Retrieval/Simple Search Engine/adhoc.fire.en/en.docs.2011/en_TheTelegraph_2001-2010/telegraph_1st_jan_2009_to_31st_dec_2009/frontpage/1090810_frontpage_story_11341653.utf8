                                                                                                           Singed NH-33 caves in, 48 families face eviction 
  - Governor urges coal minister to check fire, fund rehab          OUR BUREAU                            The 15ft wide crater created on NH-33 near Kujju on Sunday. Telegraph picture                                            
	Hazaribagh/Ranchi, Aug. 9: The states worst fears have come true.         
	Even before work could begin on a proposed diversion near Kujju to facilitate movement of traffic on NH-33  the states lifeline singed by a raging coal mine fire  a portion of the highway near Lohagate caved in today, within 24 hours of mines secretary S.K. Satpathy setting a 90-day deadline for the new route.        
	The disaster has prompted Governor K. Sankaranarayanan to shoot a letter to Union minister of state for coal Sriprakash Jaiswal seeking immediate help to tackle the underground blaze.        
	Sources said that around 3.45am, the stretch, where the fire has been raging for over a month now, suddenly collapsed, creating a 15ft wide crater. Tall columns of gas and smoke spewing carbon monoxide billowed out of the chasm, upping the pollution level by several notches. The blaze reduced rows of trees to leafless skeletons.        
	The district administration rushed a team of senior officials led by Ramgarh deputy commissioner (DC) Arun Kumar to the spot.         
	Taking stock of the situation, Kumar cordoned the area and ordered shifting of 48 families living in the peril zone. B.N. Sahay, an official from the Union ministry of road transport and highway, also paid a visit to the site. The governor, clearly upset with the Central Coalfields Limited (CCL), urged the Union minister to ensure that the best technology be used to douse the fire.         
	In his letter, he said that the CCL management had not taken the job seriously even though state officials had alerted its chairman-cum-managing director, R.K. Saha, as early as July 16.         
	The casual approach led to craters 50m deep on NH-33, which connects Ranchi with Patna, he said, requesting the Union minister to also fund the rehabilitation of the 48 families who will be shifted to Ramgarh for the time being. The CCL is legally mandated to rehabilitate them, he pointed out.                                                  
	Talking to The Telegraph, DC Kumar said: Our primary concern is to shift the 48 families from the affected zone at the earliest. I have instructed officials of CCL to speed up efforts in this regard. We have even served notices to the people.                                 
	But the residents are not willing to follow the administrations directive yet.         
	We have been living here for the past 35 years and cannot move elsewhere just like that. The administration has no plans to rehabilitate us and we will not follow any groundless order, said Ramesh, a local resident.        
	Meanwhile, Hazaribagh MP Yashwant Sinha blamed both the state and the CCL for not taking appropriate action to aver the cave-in.         
	The lackadaisical attitude of both the administration and these two companies are to be blamed for the collapse of the highway  the lifeline of the state, he said.         
	Though the CCL and the district administration had earlier expressed helplessness in dousing the fire, teachers of Vinoba Bhave University (VBU) believe that the situation could have been controlled. Head of science department Ramyatan Prasad and former director of higher education K.K. Srivastava said that the first step should have been blocking the oxygen supply to the abandoned CCL mines. Then, liquid nitrogen and sand could have been used to douse the flames, they added.         
	V.V. Dogra of Bhagalpur University said: At this stage, it is more important to control the fire. In the past few days, the fire had spread rapidly. If no concrete action is taken immediately, Kujju will soon become another Jharia.

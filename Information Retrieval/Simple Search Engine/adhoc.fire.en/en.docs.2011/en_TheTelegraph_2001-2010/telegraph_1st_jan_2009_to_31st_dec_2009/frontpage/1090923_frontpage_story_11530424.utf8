The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Another quake strikes in 12 hours
                                                                                                           Another quake strikes in 12 hours
          A STAFF REPORTER                               
	Guwahati, Sept. 22: A moderate earthquake shook Guwahati and parts of the Northeast early this morning, barely 12 hours after another quake yesterday afternoon tilted a tower of a residential complex in the Assam capital, triggering fears that it was unfit for habitation.        
	Todays earthquake, with a magnitude of 5.7 on the Richter scale, had its epicentre in Myanmar and shook Guwahati, parts of Shillong, Mizoram and Manipur around 1.09am, said the Regional Seismological Centre in Shillong.         
	No damage was reported though.        
	Yesterdays earthquake, however, killed four from Assam in Bhutan. The bodies were handed over to the Assam government today.         
	All four were from Darangamela in Baksa.        
	P.C. Gohain, the district deputy commissioner of Baksa, said the bodies were brought today and later taken to Nalbari district for post-mortem. They (the deceased) were daily wagers, said to be working in a road construction project when they were killed, he said.         
	The afternoon quake, measuring 6.2 on the Richter scale, also dangerously tilted one of the two five-storey towers of Jaga Bandhu apartment at Bhangagarh.         
	The Kamrup (metro) district administration today asked the PWD to ascertain whether the buildings were safe for human habitation.         
	Our officials visited the apartment and made an on-the-spot assessment of the situation. Since we do not have the technical know-how to find out the extent of damage, we have sought a report from the PWD, based on which action will be taken, Kamrup (metro) deputy commissioner Prateek Hajela said.         
	The building division of the PWD will conduct the survey and is likely to submit its report within the next few days. After the tremor, the building has tilted perilously leaving a space of just six inches between the two buildings, a source said.         
	Seventy-two families live in the two apartment buildings, developed by builder P. Gogoi and Associates.         
	The source said the PWD has been asked to see whether the foundation of these buildings was strong enough to withstand an earthquake of yesterdays intensity or more.                           
	He said if the PWD declares the building unfit for human habitation, they will take steps to evacuate it.         
	The district administration would also assess two other buildings in which cracks reportedly appeared following the earthquake.         
	One of the buildings is located at Fancy Bazar and the other at Kumarpara.         
	The source said the administration was also contemplating a comprehensive study to assess the seismic resistance of all the multi-storied buildings in the city.         
	The government today also asked the district administrations to identify unsafe buildings in the state and evacuate people from there.         
	Revenue minister Bhumidhar Barman said the district administrations were asked to identify roads which were not broad enough for ambulance and fire brigade to pass and take steps to widen them.        
	The directive was issued following a high-level meeting chaired by Barman to review the earthquake-preparedness of various agencies and departments.        
	The minister later also visited Jaga Bandhu apartment.

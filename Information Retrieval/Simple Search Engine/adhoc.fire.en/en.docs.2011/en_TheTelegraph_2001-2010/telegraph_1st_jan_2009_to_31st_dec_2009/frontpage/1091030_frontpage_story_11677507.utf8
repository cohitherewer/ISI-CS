                                                                                                           Daylong blitz on Indira death anniversary
          SANJAY K. JHA                      Indira Gandhi                          
	New Delhi, Oct. 29: Hectic daylong programmes, punctuated by two minutes of silence, mark the Congresss plans to observe the 25th anniversary of Indira Gandhis assassination on October 31.        
	Both party and government will flood television, radio and newspapers with advertisements on Indira, for which jingles and short films have been prepared by ad agencies.        
	Prayer meetings, blood donation camps and seminars will be held across India, right from the block level, and goods will be distributed among the poor. Congress members will observe two minutes silence from 9.08am, the exact time when Indira was shot.        
	In Delhi, an exhibition on the former Prime Ministers life opens tomorrow at the Ram Lila grounds where a 40-minute documentary will be shown round the clock. Congress leaders have ordered hoardings and banners put up across the city.        
	The Indira Gandhi memorial at 1 Safdarjung Road has been redone and Sonia Gandhi has visited the place to oversee the preparations.        
	Sonia has in a letter to party members urged them to recall Indiras life and rededicate ourselves to the values she cherished, values that continue to have so much contemporary relevance.        
	She has emphasised the former Prime Ministers austere lifestyle and commitment to the poor and weaker sections. Although Sonia mentioned Nehrus influence on Indira, the letter said: She left her own distinctive and indelible mark on Indian and world history by her indomitable courage, tireless energy and abiding concern for the welfare of the poor, the disadvantaged and the deprived.        
	Among Indiras main achievements, Sonia has listed the Green Revolution, nationalisation of banks, her foresight in investing in science and technology, nuclear programmes, communications and broadcasting and environment protection, the liberation of Bangladesh and the welfare schemes for the poor and the rural population.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | TMZ website far ahead in reporting news of death

	New York, June 27: TMZ, the carnivorous celebrity news website, is accustomed to beating other media outlets on the stories that shape the entertainment world.         
	On Thursday, it not only scooped every other outlet by announcing Michael Jacksons death, it apparently beat the coroners office, too  by six minutes.         
	The blog  owned by the media conglomerate, Time Warner, but operated as a Web-traffic-fuelled fief in Hollywood  seemed to have sources everywhere: at Jacksons mansion; in the ambulance; and in the corridors of the UCLA Medical Center.         
	TMZs short post about the death was published at 5:20 pm eastern time. For more than an hour, TMZ was essentially the only outlet claiming that Jackson was dead.         
	Television and newspaper journalists read the TMZ report but largely held off on repeating it, for fear of making a mistake.         
	Still, the bulletin traversed the Web with remarkable speed, creating a stark divide: on the Internet Jackson was dead, and on TV he was still alive.         
	By the early evening Jacksons death had become the No. 1 story on newscasts worldwide. The intense, almost voyeuristic interest strained many Web servers, crashing AOLs instant messaging service and even tripping up Google News for about half an hour.         
	Tens of millions of viewers watched hastily arranged tributes to Jackson on nearly a dozen channels.         
	But it was TMZ that consistently led the news cycle, beginning with a report that paramedics had been called to the mansion.         
	Shortly thereafter, before any TV networks had mentioned Jackson, the site said he had suffered an episode of cardiac arrest.         
	We are totally wired in this town, Harvey Levin, the sites editor-in-chief, said in a telephone interview yesterday. The Jackson news was easily the biggest scoop in TMZs nearly four-year history. Kurt Andersen, a journalist and cultural critic, said the story was highly indicative of the evolving editorial practices that media outlets are grappling with.         
	Among many journalists, theres still this residual but not yet vestigial instinct to think: Oh, its just TMZ, lets wait for The Associated Press or The New York Times or The Los Angeles Times before we can say its true, he said, adding: I dont think in, say, five years, that will be the case.         
	The Jackson family said the time of death was 5:26pm eastern, several minutes after TMZs report, leading some to wonder whether the website looked accurate only in hindsight.         
	Levin stood by the report, calling it 100 per cent accurate.         
	Paramedics on the scene said he was dead long before we posted the story, Levin said, perhaps providing a hint about the his sources.         
	Like many other media entities, TMZ pays for photos. Levin also said the site will pay tip fees that lead to stories, but not for stories outright.         
	He refused to say whether he had paid any sources during the Jackson coverage, but he denied that the sites staffers pay police officials or nurses.         
	TMZ appeared able to stay online during the crush of traffic on Thursday evening. Twitter saw the biggest increase in short tweets since the presidential election.         
	The Jackson entry in Wikipedia appeared to have set the record as the most-viewed article in the eight-year history of the online encyclopedia.         
	In print, Rolling Stone and Life said they would publish commemorative book-style magazines about Jacksons life.         
	Time magazine will produce a special edition about the singer, due on newsstands on Monday.        
	MTV and BET flashed back to the early 1980s on Thursday and yesterday as the channels showed marathons of Jacksons music videos.         
	Van Toffler, the president of the MTV Networks music group, said the singer undoubtedly moved the art form of the video from what were maybe mini-commercials to mini-movies.        
	He observed that when the 13-minute Thriller music video had its premiere on MTV on December 2, 1983, viewers had never seen anything like it.         
	Im not sure weve seen anything like it since, he added.                     NEW YORK TIMES NEWS SERVICE

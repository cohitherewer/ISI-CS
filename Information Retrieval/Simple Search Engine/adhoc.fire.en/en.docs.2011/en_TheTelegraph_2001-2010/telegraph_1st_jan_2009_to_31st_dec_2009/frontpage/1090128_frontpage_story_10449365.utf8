The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | 70000 jobs lost in one-day jolt   Global giants wield the axe
                                                                                                           70000 jobs lost in one-day jolt 
  Global giants wield the axe          OUR BUREAU                            Davos, Switzerland, on the eve of the World Economic Forum meeting. (Reuters)                                        
	Jan. 27: The global economic downturn burst into thousands of homes yesterday with the announcement of more than 70,000 job cuts across the world.         
	The staggering one-day toll, involving some of the worlds largest and sturdy companies , underscored how quickly layoffs were accelerating and how widely misery was spreading throughout the labour market.        
	In one of the darkest days since the credit crunch started, more than 4,000 posts in Britain were axed with Corus, the UKs largest steelmaker that is owned by the Tatas, alone shedding 2,500 employees. The Corus move was expected but it coincided with an avalanche across the Atlantic.        
	In the US, some leading companies sacked a total of as many as 45,000 workers  the number many times higher than the 1,900 Jet Airways had sacked and then taken back in what is considered the largest declared retrenchment in India on a single day.        
	The global job losses represent yet more evidence that the financial crisis that erupted on Wall Street two years ago has now infected the whole of the corporate world, engulfing industries ranging from healthcare to heavy-equipment manufacturers.         
	In America, jobs began disappearing in home building and mortgage operations early in the recession, then across finance and banking more generally.         
	Now the axe is falling across large swathes of manufacturing, retailing and information technology, taking out workers from New York to Seattle. Last week, Microsoft announced its first significant job cuts ever.        
	Because companies like Microsoft invest in their workers skills and knowledge, they usually delay major workforce reductions as long as they can. But with orders for new products and services drying up and financing tight, employers are looking to shrink their costs drastically and slashing payrolls.                
	In all, 22 of the 30 companies that are part of the Dow Jones industrial average have announced job cuts since October.        
	The impact of such an upheaval abroad is expected to be felt in India in export-oriented industries like gems and jewellery, textiles, IT and IT-enabled services.        
	An official from the Confederation of Indian Textile Industry told The Telegraph that by the end of this financial year, close to 1 million jobs could be lost and, so far, around 7 lakh employees had been affected in the sector that employs 35 million workers in the country.        
	In the US, Caterpillar, one of the worlds biggest heavy-equipment makers, led the field in cutting jobs. The woes of Caterpillar, which reaped gains from the construction boom worldwide and suffered when global demand slumped, highlights how badly President Barack Obamas stimulus package is needed.        
	If the package unleashes construction of bridges and roads and other countries launch similar initiatives, the demand for equipment like earth movers will rise and it will have a trickle-down effect on the job market.

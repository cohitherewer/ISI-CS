The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Indias jail politics: When nothing else works, bring on the lumpens
                                                                                                           Indias jail politics: When nothing else works, bring on the lumpens
          SANKARSHAN THAKUR                             A Varun Gandhi supporter with a slipper in one hand and a brick in another in Pilibhit. BJP candidate Varun, 29, surrendered before a Pilibhit court on Saturday and was sent to the district jail for two days. His bail application will be heard on March 30.

	New Delhi, March 28: Gregor Johann Mendel experimented painstakingly with pea pods to bring to us the key truth about genetics and heredity: Like Begets Like. Weve been spared Mendels hard work; weve only had to be keen on the national ringside to be appraised of that wisdom. Varun Gandhi, unrepentant over patent wrongdoing, basked in the vanity of violations outside the Pilibhit court this morning just as his father Sanjay did post-Emergency three decades ago.         
	Today, it was a saffron clamour around Varun, making shrill virtue of villainy as he emerged, rapped and interned for the weekend, from the courthouse.        
	Back then, it used to be Sanjays rampaging khadi-shirts, riding routinely rough into attempts to bring his many Emergency-era excesses to book. Defying court summons, challenging judicial right to pronounce on documented misdeed, collaring judges with allegations of political motive and mala fide prejudice.         
	When Sanjay could escape arrest no more  in the summer of 1978  they loosed hell on the streets of central Delhi. It was zindabad for the guilty Sanjay then, it was zindabad for the errant Varun this morning  a discordant celebration of calumny, the street roused to shake established standards of the state.                     
	It was lumpens for Sanjay then, and it is the same lot wearing different colours for Varun today, said a senior journalist who reported Sanjays post-Emergency skirmishes with justice first hand.        
	There were huge and clear grounds to prosecute him, and yet he was able to create a sentiment that raged against civil society and its rules. But he was not the first nor the last to benefit from baser appeals, as his son Varun is probably demonstrating.         
	Images from another corner of the country flashing on television screens all day probably underline the power of the crass and the crude to seduce us, if only in small, though often critical, spells: Gujarat minister Maya Kodanani, arrested for murder and abetment to murder at Naroda Patiya during the Gujarat horror of 2002, waving triumphally to a huge eddy applauding her all the way to prison.         
	Her boss Narendra Modi famously waved away wanton post-Godhra massacres with a political flick to Newtonian science  every action has an equal and opposite reaction. Lal Krishna Advani, Murli Manohar Joshi and Uma Bharti have expressed no remorse for  and profited from  their celebratory ek dhakka aur do clasps as the Babri Masjid was razed by frenzied mobs, dome by dome.        
	There has been no rejection of the late Rajiv Gandhis cryptic justification of the anti-Sikh violence following Indiras assassination. And Jagdish Tytler and Sajjan Kumar keep getting awarded Congress tickets.        
	With his unapologetic breach of the acceptable in his Pilibhit speeches, Varun may just have proved himself a keen student of the Indian rules of political conduct; he may have cleverly cashed in on sentiment that has oft been widely accepted irrespective of its state unacceptability.        
	There are those who draw more parallels between Sanjay and Varun than just their irreverence to norms. With the Turkman Gate demolitions in Old Delhi and his zeal for sterilisation, Sanjay had become particularly feared  and despised  among the minorities. Varun has quickly achieved the same for himself far beyond the confines of Pilibhit.        
	But whats probably uppermost in the young BJP Gandhis mind at the moment is the course his father was able to chart consigning civility and convention to the winds.        
	Of the dozens of charges against Sanjay --- extra-constitutional authoritarianism, forced sterilisation, vandal demolitions, suppression of freedoms and dissent --- one came to really stick: the destruction of Amrit Nahatas controversial, and now fabled, film Kissa Kursi Ka, meant to be a less-than-subtle take on the Indira-Sanjay dictatorship of party and country.        
	A sessions court convicted Sanjay in 1979 for destroying the movie. Judge .N. Vohra ruled that Sanjay and Emergency-era information and broadcasting minister, V.C. Shukla, were guilty of criminal conspiracy, criminal breach of trust, mischief by burning property and destruction of evidence.        
	Sanjays response to the verdict: This is a false case.        
	From his visage in Pilibhit today, its not even remotely likely Varun will plead guilty on Monday. Sanjays boy must, of course, have a strong memory of what followed his fathers enraged rejection of charges against him in the Janata Party years.        
	Indira Gandhi won the 1980 election and returned to power just two-odd years after shed been so rudely rejected. Varun has already proved how well like begets like; now hes probably waiting for history to repeat itself and reward wrongdoing.

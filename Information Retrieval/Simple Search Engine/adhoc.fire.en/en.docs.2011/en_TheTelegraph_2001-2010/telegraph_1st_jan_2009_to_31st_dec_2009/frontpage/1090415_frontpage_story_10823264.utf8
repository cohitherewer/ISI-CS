          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Bhubaneswar, April 14: Four suspected Naxalites were detained today from the forests close to Nalco bauxite mines at Damanjodi, where the rebels tried to loot an explosive depot on Sunday.        
	Director-general of police Manmohan Praharaj, who has been camping at Damanjodi to supervise a joint combing operation by Orissa-Andhra Pradesh police, confirmed the development.        
	The night-long joint operation was carried out with the help of two IAF helicopters to locate and chase the rebels who were believed to be hiding in the nearby forests.         
	Koraput superintendent of police Deepak Kumar said that four persons were held from the forested area between Damanjodi and Narayanpatna. They were suspected to be Maoist rebels involved in Sunday nights operation. One of them was a Naxalite cadre earlier.        
	Kumar, however, refused to divulge the details. They have been detained and interrogation is on, he said, adding that the body of another Maoist rebel was recovered today from the forest after the joint combing operation. More casualties from the Maoists side were expected, he added.        
	Yesterday, bodies of four Maoists, including a woman cadre, were recovered from the bauxite mines area, about 600km from here. Police suspect some more bodies were carried back by the rebels while retreating into the nearby forests yesterday.         
	Praharaj said around 250 boxes of explosives, which the Maoists had attempted to loot, were found from the forest. The mini truck loaded with explosives, which had been driven away by the rebels, was found abandoned 5km away from the explosive depot of the largest bauxite mine in Asia.         
	An estimated 5 tonnes of explosives, mainly gelatin sticks, were recovered, said Kumar, adding that they had sought the details of explosives missing from the truck.         
	Meanwhile, 10 CISF jawans, who had been killed in the Sunday gun battle with the rebels, have been identified. A guard of honour was given to the martyrs in Koraput in presence of CISF director-general N.R. Das and senior state police officers.

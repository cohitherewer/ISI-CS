	Ranchi/New Delhi, Aug. 24: Maoists blew up railway tracks and bombed a mobile phone tower in Latehar and Palamau districts on the first day of their two-day bandh across five states, prompting the Union home ministry to ask all rebel-infested states to step up vigil against possible targets.        
	Todays attacks in Jharkhand  the house of an anti-insurgency activist in Chatra was also torched in the demolition drive that began at midnight yesterday  rendered at least a Rs 50 lakh blow to the cash-strapped state. Though sources confirmed the role of Maoists in all three incidents, DGP V.D. Ram expressed scepticism over the attack in Chatra, hinting at possible involvement of local gangs.         
	Around 50 armed rebels descended on Kupbera, 200km from here, in the Vishrampur police station area of Palamau at 12.05am, barely five minutes after the 48-hour Maoist-sponsored bandh was enforced in Bihar, Chhattisgarh, Bengal and Orissa, besides Jharkhand.         
	They blew up a portion of a Bharat Sanchar Nigam Limited (BSNL) tower, erected at a cost of Rs 50 lakh, leaving a big crater on the spot. Divisional engineer, BSNL, U.S. Manjhi said the attack had snapped mobile connectivity in the forested area. This, he added, was a rebel strategy to make their hideouts secure.        
	Within seven hours of the strike in Kupbera, another armed squad of 20 blasted a pillar (No. 236/37) and small stretch of tracks between Hehegarha and Ghumandi stations on the CIC section of Dhanbad division in Latehar district, disrupting train services for four hours. While the Delhi-Ranchi Rajdhani Express had crossed the stretch several minutes earlier, the blast  though low in intensity  stranded the Gomoh-Choupan Express for over three hours.         
	Senior Dhanbad divisional operating manager, East Central Railway, Niraj Ambastha, said that no train was diverted or cancelled as a very small stretch was affected.         
	Only the passenger train running between Barwadih and Gomoh was delayed. Services resumed at 9.30am, he said.         
	Earlier in the day, the rebels also targeted the abandoned house of one Moinuddin Khan, an anti-Maoist village activist, at Jolhabigha in Chatra, 250km from here. A group of 100 vandalised Khans property and torched the house before leaving.         
	DGP Ram and Latehar SP Kuldip Dwivedi have only confirmed the first two incidents.         
	Response to the bandh was total in several parts of the state, including Ghatshila sub-division of East Singhbhum, the industrial hubs of Chandil and Chowka in Seraikela-Kharsawan, Nawadih, Bermo, Gomia and Petarwar areas of Bokaro, besides the rebel pockets of West Singhbhum, Chatra, Palamau and Latehar.         
	While schools, offices and business establishments remained shut, roads, including NH-33, witnessed thin traffic throughout the day.

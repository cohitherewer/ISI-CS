                                                                                                           Rain prevents Rahul visit
          OUR BUREAU                              
	Agartala/Itanagar, Oct. 6: It was a case of so near yet so far for Congress leader Rahul Gandhi and thousands of his followers in Itanagar who were left disappointed as bad weather played spoilsport.        
	The Gandhi scion landed in time at the Lilabari Airport in Assams Lakhimpur district but he could not take a flight to Itanagar, 40 km away, to address an election rally because of bad weather.         
	A Congress leader in Itanagar said the special protection group (SPG) refused to give clearance for Rahuls chopper, as visibility was very poor because of overcast conditions and occasional drizzles.         
	At the picturesque Indira Gandhi Park in Itanagar, which wore a festive look to welcome Rahul, the announcement disappointed thousands who had braved the constant drizzle and thronged the park in their traditional attire.        
	The Congresss poster boy looked down from lifesize banners around the ground, as young Arunachalee boys and girls waited for hours for a glimpse of their hero only to return disappointed.         
	So near yet to far. This is disappointing, said a young Congress worker, as he sat down on one of the hundreds of vacant chairs after all had left. We worked hard for nothing, he added.        
	From Lilabari, Rahul went to Agartala to address a scheduled rally. He declared his resolve to strengthen the partys frontal organisations, the Youth Congress and the NSUI, in the Northeast by involving people belonging to the Scheduled Tribes and Scheduled Castes. He reached Manu in Dhalai district by a chopper. Here he addressed a convention of Youth Congress members belonging to the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes at the Manu community hall. He returned to Agartala one-and-a-half hours behind schedule.

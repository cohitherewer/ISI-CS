The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Why budget bypasses state
                                                                                                           Why budget bypasses state
          AMIT GUPTA                               
	Ranchi, July 7: Given its poor track record of implementing centrally sponsored schemes, Jharkhand is unlikely to benefit from significant increases in social sector allocations announced by Union finance minister Pranab Mukherjee in Budget 2009.        
	If allocation to the Pradhan Mantri Gram Sadak Yojana (PMGSY) was increased by 59 per cent to Rs 12,000 crore, the Jawaharlal Nehru National Urban Renewal Mission (JNNURM) received a hike of 87 per cent working out to Rs 12,887 crore.        
	The allocation for the UPA governments flagship rural job scheme, National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (NREGS), was up 144 per cent to Rs 39,100 crore and the uniform minimum wage fixed at Rs 100.        
	But Jharkhand hasnt been able to get its act together, its continued political turbulence adding to problems, ending up with the state being put under Presidents rule.         
	Not surprisingly, the states top bosses, including chief secretary and various departmental secretaries, had no place to duck when the visiting Union cabinet secretary, K.M. Chandrashekhar, and his entourage of 20 senior officials from Delhi, flew down to Ranchi to conduct a review.         
	His rating of the states implementation record of central schemes hovered between pretty poor and satisfactory.        
	In the PMGSY, the state rural works department was still executing schemes in its sixth phase, amounting to Rs 928 crore, under which 336 rural roads, all bituminous, were to be laid to connect the rural hinterland.         
	Jharkhands progress was tardy at best, while other states had already begun work on the seventh and eighth phases.         
	There are about 300 pending PMGSY schemes that were supposed to have been completed between 2001 and 2007, said A. Prakash, the chief engineer in the rural works department.         
	JNNURM was meant to significantly upgrade city life in capital Ranchi, Dhanbad and Jamshedpur. But so far, no project has been implemented despite sanctions worth Rs 2,000 crore.                                 
	Among the projects cleared were a revamped water supply scheme, solid waste management and a city bus service for Ranchi with similar plans for Dhanbad and Jamshedpur.         
	Jamshedpur has received funds for 50 buses, but other urban infrastructure schemes have been held up for want of a memorandum of understanding (MoU) that was to be signed between the state and the Union ministry of urban development, but was held up due to a legal tussle.        
	Gajanand Ram, the assistant town planner in the state urban development department who looks after implementation of JNNURM schemes, was however hopeful.        
	Since the Centre had increased allocations, the state would now send in its proposals for various schemes under JNNURM, he said, but could not provide a time frame.        
	Budget 2009 also hiked allocation for National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) for the national highway development programme (NHDP) by 23 per cent to Rs 8,578 crore.         
	In Jharkhand, only one road project  a 265km thoroughfare between Barhi and Bahragora  was under NHDP, funds for which had been allocated in earlier budgets. But thats yet to start.        
	A Delhi-based NHAI official was scathing about the states implementation record. Jharkhand can reap the benefit of central allocations only if projects get implemented. But unfortunately, we havent been able to ensure that, he said.        
	The contract for a Rs 650-crore four-laning project between Hazaribagh and Ranchi, part of the Barhi-Bahragora stretch, was ready to be awarded to IL amp;FS and Punj Llyod under BOT-annuity basis, but is held up for a cabinet nod.        
	On NREGS, out of a total fund allocation of over Rs 2,347 crore, the state has been able to utilise about Rs 1,341 crore since the job scheme was launched. And Jharkhand, again, was one of the worst performers, with economist Jean Drze, entrusted by the centre to conduct a social audit of the scheme, saying as much.        
	Moreover, as many as 36,548 projects taken up under NREGS were running behind scheduled.        
	The states development commissioner, S.K. Choudhary, however, put up a brave front. Jharkhand will benefit from increased central allocations, he insisted. More money for development should ensure better development prospects, he maintained, but agreed the state needed a strategy to make use of central funds.

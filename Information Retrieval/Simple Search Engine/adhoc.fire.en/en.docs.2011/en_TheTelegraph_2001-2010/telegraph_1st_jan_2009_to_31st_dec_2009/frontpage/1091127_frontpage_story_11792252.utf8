  - Soni says ex-CM being tried by media          OUR BUREAU                                                    
	Ranchi/Jamshedpur, Nov. 26: The Congress today sprung a surprise by claiming that it was not averse to taking the support of former chief minister Madhu Koda as long as he wasnt pronounced guilty by a court of law.        
	Addressing a news meet in the capital today, Union I amp;B minister and senior Congress leader Ambika Soni said: I am not defending Koda, but, at the same time, cannot approve of his trial by media. We are not interfering with investigations. But holding someone guilty is the jurisdiction of a court. Anyone who respects our commitment to secular development and has faith in our leader (Sonia Gandhi) is welcome to the UPA fold, she said, leaving the partys doors open for Koda in the process.        
	Sonis statement seemed contrary to the Congresss poll strategy, where it focussed its campaign on distancing itself from the former chief minister who had come under the Enforcement Directorate scanner for having allegedly amassed over Rs 2,000 crore through illegal channels.        
	Congresss Jharkhand affairs in-charge K. Keshav Rao echoed Soni. He said the RJD, LJP, JMM and other secular forces were still important constituents of the UPA even though they had not joined hands with the Congress during the Assembly elections. The Congresss doors (for post-poll alliances) are open for them. We decided to fight the elections here with the JVM(P). But that does not mean we have parted ways with our other allies. We have great respect for each other, he added.        
	Insiders said frustrated by tepid public response during the first phase of Assembly elections and unnerved by reports suggesting that all tainted former ministers might excel in their respective strongholds, the Congress had decided to soften its stand. Party leaders and cadres have reportedly been asked to refrain from directly targeting Koda and his former ministerial colleagues during campaigning for the next four phases.        
	Having touched a raw nerve on the Koda issue, Soni went on to add that the Congress was trying to form a government on its own in Jharkhand. She cited several examples to prove that the party had done an excellent job everywhere in the past and that AICC general secretary Rahul Gandhis campaigns had infused new confidence among workers and leaders. We fully endorse the Election Commissions methodology to cleanse the system. But then, an accused (read Koda) is innocent till convicted by court, she reiterated.        
	On the Liberhan Commissions recommendation to set up a regulatory body for the media, the minister said she favoured a self-regulatory body to ensure the freedom of Press. A task force has been constituted to work out the modalities, she added.         
	Touring the steel city earlier in the day, Soni promised a corruption-free government, if Congress was voted to power.         
	She cited examples of Maharashtra and New Delhi, where the party had formed governments thrice. It is because we keep our promises, we have enjoyed the support of people there. We want the same in Jharkhand. Experiments in the past nine years have failed. The people of this state should give Congress a chance to prove its worth, she said.

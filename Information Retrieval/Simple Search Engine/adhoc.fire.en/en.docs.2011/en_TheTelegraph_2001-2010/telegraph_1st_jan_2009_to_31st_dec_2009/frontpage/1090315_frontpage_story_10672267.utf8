The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Cable diktat in Valley Tora Bora
                                                                                                           Cable diktat in Valley Tora Bora
          MUZAFFAR RAINA                      Channel check                          
	Srinagar, March 14: A region known as Kashmirs Tora Bora, after the Taliban stronghold in Afghanistan, faces a new wave of moral vigilantism. Its clerics yesterday asked cable operators to stop showing obscene channels.        
	The Valleys Tral area earned its sobriquet because it has been a long-time hub of militants. Tora Bora had been under the Talibans iron grip even after the regimes ouster from Kabul, and Osama bin Laden was once thought to be hiding there.        
	Apparently taking the cue from the growing Talibanisation of Pakistans tribal areas, much of which neighbours Kashmir, clerics at a Friday congregation in Tral regretted that cable channels were spreading obscenity.        
	There was a clear direction to stop their operations, a police source said.        
	He said cable operators had resumed operations in Tral barely a fortnight ago, after shutting shop longer than in other places in the Valley for fear of militants.        
	We used to watch some channels through dish antennas, but an operator recently laid cables in the area and a lot of channels are now available, the source said.        
	A prominent cleric in Tral, Molvi Noor Ahmad, said the cable operators had been asked to stop beaming only the obscene channels, and had accepted the advice.        
	We issued an appeal asking cable operators not to harm our society. We have received complaints from people that their content is not good, the cleric said.        
	There are some good channels, including a few which have religious content. We are not against such channels.        
	The police, however, said all the channels were still available. These clerics do enjoy considerable clout and it will take a couple of days to gauge the full impact of the call, a source said.        
	Cable operators have always been under pressure in Kashmir. In the 1990s, the militants had banned them, and several operators were injured in attacks.        
	Over the years, the militants stopped interfering in cable operations or merely banned obscene channels. The operators would comply for some time and then ignore the diktat. Tral and some other areas, however, remained the exception till recently.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Tax cut in new stimulus shot
                                                                                                           Tax cut in new stimulus shot
  - Relief on utility bills, steel amp; cement        OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                                    
	New Delhi, Feb. 24: The Centre today cut excise duties on a wide range of products by 2 per cent and trimmed service tax by another 2 per cent as part of a fresh stimulus package to jump-start faltering businesses.        
	Stand-in finance minister Pranab Mukherjee announced the package of measures  the third in as many months  while closing the debate on the interim budget.        
	Industry, however, clamoured for another round of interest rate cuts to buttress todays fiscal measures. The RBI is widely expected to trim the benchmark rates soon.        
	Excise duty on products ranging from two-wheelers and light commercial vehicles to consumer durables will now come down to 8 per cent  which will be the general floor rate.        
	Small cars  which already attract excise at 8 per cent  will not benefit from the duty rejig. Similarly, medicine prices will not be affected.        
	Last February, P. Chidambaram had cut the floor rate of excise to 14 per cent. It was further reduced to 10 per cent in early December.        
	Service tax will now come down to 10 per cent from 12 per cent earlier, providing partial relief on the payment of utility bills and credit card use.        
	The central excise duty on bulk cement will go down from 10 per cent to 8 per cent or from Rs 290 a tonne to Rs 230, whichever is higher.        
	Steel, cement and many consumer durable makers have promised to cut product prices. Steel prices are expected to fall by Rs 600 a tonne from tomorrow, companies said.        
	I have tried to make certain changes to provide a further stimulus to the economy. Even though the signals are encouraging, the full impact of the recession in other parts of the world, particularly Asia and Europe, has yet to unfold, Mukherjee said.        
	The revenue loss because of the measures announced today was estimated at Rs 30,000 crore in a full year, which would deepen worries of global credit rating agencies which have been concerned about the rising fiscal and revenue deficits. The countrys fiscal deficit is expected to top Rs 362,000 crore.        
	Mukherjee announced the measures on the very day that Standard amp; Poors, the global rating agency, flagged its concern by lowering its outlook on the long-term sovereign rating from stable to negative. There is now danger that S amp;P could downgrade Indias rating to junk bond status  a tag it shed in January 2007.        
	The cuts in excise and reduction in service tax will go a long way in stimulating consumer demand, said Chandrajit Banerjee, the director-general of the CII.

  - Call for central forces, no to poll duty outside city        KINSUK BASU AND OUR BUREAU                            Lalit Modi                                        
	March 10: Calcutta police have set two conditions for agreeing to the new dates proposed for the Indian Premier League matches to be held in the city in April and May.        
	In a report to be submitted to the Bengal government, Calcutta police commissioner Gautam Mohan Chakrabarti has said that a minimum of three companies of central paramilitary forces would have to be present during the matches. Also, personnel of his force cannot be posted out of the city on poll duty till the IPL season ends in Calcutta.        
	Under the revised schedule, Calcuttas matches have been proposed for April 11, 14, 16, 21 and 26, and May 2 and 4.        
	Bengal votes on April 30, May 7 and 13.        
	A final call on the dates would be taken at a meeting at a Writers Buildings on Thursday, to be presided over by chief secretary Asok Mohan Chakrabarti.         
	The Union home ministry today sent a reminder to the states concerned asking them how they planned to organise security and what they wanted the Centre to do.         
	Ministry officials said that with heightened threat perception for cities like Mumbai and Hyderabad, they wanted clarity on who would be responsible in case of any incident.         
	IPL commissioner Lalit Modi vowed to take direct responsibility for all security arrangements for the teams amid reports that some foreign players had reservations about travelling to the subcontinent.         
	Modi said the leagues governing council would centralise security, relieving the eight franchisees of the responsibility.        
	 Security is paramount for us this year it will be IPLs direct responsibility and centrally handled. The budget (for security) has been increased 10 times over; we will leave no stone unturned. From the moment foreign players land in India until they leave, well take over their security, Modi said in Mumbai.        
	Modi also said the revised schedule was 90 per cent approved.         
	We have got confirmation from three states in writing so far but we want everyone to give it in writing before announcing the revised schedule, he said.        
	However, the home ministry appeared out of the loop with top sources saying no state had replied as yet. We have received nothing, said an official.         
	Calcutta police sources made it clear the demand for additional manpower was justified. One has to weigh the resources available against the priorities. If we are talking about security and elections and also planning to hold IPL matches, then the demand for additional manpower is obvious, said a senior officer handling security affairs for Calcutta police.         
	The police are comfortable with the new timetable, which packs in five matches in April, the last fixed for April 26, four days before the first phase of elections in Bengal.         
	The new dates take into account the concerns we had raised earlier and thats fine. But a change in schedule is not enough. With elections round the corner and security being the top concern, we want the Union home ministry to realise that using officers from the city police to the best of their abilities would be our main concern, particularly while handling law and order situations, said an officer.         
	Sources said the central paramilitary forces, if available, would ideally be coupled with the city force in covering the hotels where players would be put up and for securing the ground, inside and outside. That done, the remaining force from the city would be deployed to cover election rallies and other exigencies.        
	IPL sources said in case security proved to be a problem in Calcutta, the Kolkata Knight Riders would have to move out to centres like Cuttack.         
	The Barabati Stadium (in Cuttack) has hosted international matches. Teams have usually stayed in Bhubaneswar and played at Cuttack, which is less than an hours drive. These are unusual times and franchisees should be open to unusual solutions, said an IPL source.        
	Modi announced that apart from the eight franchise cities, Ahmedabad and Visakhapatnam would also host matches. Dharamsala and Nagpur too were under consideration, he added.

  - Journalist says Castro has 10 kids by a string of women          PHILIP HART                            Castro in 1955                                        
	London, Sept. 27: Fidel Castro has fathered at least 10 children by a string of women, according to a new book.         
	Fidel Castro is renowned in Cuba for his verbosity and longevity. But his compatriots know little about another sphere where El Commandante has proved prolific  his private life.         
	Discussing his womanising ways is strictly taboo on the Caribbean communist outpost, even on an island where the gossip grapevine flourishes in the absence of a free press.         
	But a long-time Cuba-watcher has now revealed the scale of Castros philandering and the existence of at least 10 offspring. That is more than previously believed  but very possibly not the full tally.         
	During an interview with Vanity Fair in 1993, when journalist Ann Louise Bardach asked Castro how many children he had, he smiled and answered almost a tribe.         
	During the research for Without Fidel, her new book chronicling the lives of Castro and his brother, Raul, she discovered how true that observation was.         
	Castro, now 83, was a dashing young man whose good looks and rebel swagger clearly lent him a strong sexual allure during the years before and after the 1959 revolution.         
	Indeed, media reports describe female fans swooning after he arrived triumphantly in Havana and during early trips to the US.         
	He had one child, Fidelito (Little Fidel), with his first wife Myrta Diaz-Balart in 1949 and five boys between 1962 and 1974 with Dalia Soto del Valle, a little-seen companion whom he is said to have secretly married in 1980. Remarkably, she was first shown on Cuban television in 2003, so forbidden was Castros personal domain, Bardach observes.         
	But there have been many more paramours and several other children along the way  most notably from the time when the 29-year-old rebel leader celebrated his release in 1955 after being jailed for a failed uprising.         
	Three Castro offspring were born to three women during 1956. Most famously, there was Natalia Revuelta, an aristocratic beauty who became a fierce defender of his revolution  she bore him a daughter, Alina Fernandez.         
	Bardach, an investigative journalist and a member of the Cuba Study Group at the Brookings Institution think-tank, had previously reported the existence of another illegitimate 1956 child, Panchita Pupo. She was not even known to his other offspring and her mother remains unidentified.         
	And in this book, Bardach reveals the identity of the mother of Jorge Angel, the third Castro child of 1956  Maria Laborde, an admirer whom Castro met just after he was freed.         
	She also discloses another apparent addition to the brood  a son known as Ciro, the early 1960s product of another brief fling. He was previously unknown outside the family inner circle, but a close relative of Celia Sanchez, Castros closest confidante and yet another rumoured lover, revealed his existence to the author.         
	Ciro, named after a revolutionary martyr and whose mothers name is still secret, is said to have movie star looks, with green eyes and dark complexion. He lives in a Havana suburb where nobody knows his provenance.         
	And if a claim made earlier this year by a Cuban intelligence defector that he sired another son in 1970 is true, that would take the count to 11 children by seven women  and counting.         
	Castros first name is derived from the Latin for faithful, but while he has remained true to his politics, the same cannot be said of the women in his life. His offspring have, however, largely adhered to their fathers instructions not to flaunt their privileged backgrounds and are rarely seen in public.         
	His first son, Fidelito, has received the highest prominence. But when he mishandled the countrys nuclear power programme, his father ordered his dismissal. He was fired for incompetence, Castro said. We dont have a monarchy here.         
	Many Cubans would, however, disagree with the last point  and with good reason. After the crippling intestinal disease of diverticulitis nearly killed him in 2006, Castros brother Raul was anointed to replace him. The younger Castro was confirmed as President last year in a handover which appeared almost feudal.         
	Bardach also reveals that Fidel Castros vanity and obstinacy almost proved fatal when he rejected the recommended surgery in 2006  a colostomy. Castro insisted on a much riskier operation as he did not want to suffer the perceived indignity of living with an attached bag.         
	The bolder procedure failed and Castro was nearly killed by a peritonitis infection as a result. After a life-saving colostomy was finally performed, Bardach reports that Castro was distraught. Fidel was crying, a source present in the hospital told her. He cried several times that day. He was devastated.         
	From her contacts within the Cuban medical system, she also learns that Castro was fed intravenously for five months after the surgery and lost 45 pounds.         
	A Spanish doctor brought in to treat him feared he was starving to death and gradually restored solid food to a highly restrictive diet.         
	In his occasional photo shoots with visiting Left-wing Latin American proteges, Castro has abandoned his old uniform of olive fatigues.         
	Instead, he opts for garish track suits because they hide the hated colostomy bag  emblematic of his transformation from hirsute heart-throb to frail octogenarian.

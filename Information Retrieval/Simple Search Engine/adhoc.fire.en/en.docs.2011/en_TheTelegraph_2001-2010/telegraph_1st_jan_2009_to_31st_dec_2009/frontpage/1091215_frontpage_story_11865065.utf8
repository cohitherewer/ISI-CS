	Dec. 14: The Gorkha Janmukti Morcha today called off its four-day bandh to respect requests from national leaders but said party workers would press ahead with their fast to keep up the pressure for statehood ahead of tripartite talks next Monday.        
	The Morcha claimed positive indications from the Union home minister but added that the BJP too had played a role in the temporary truce.         
	The BJP leadership, which had lost its link with the hills after the expulsion of Darjeeling MP Jaswant Singh from the party, today met a Morcha delegation in Delhi.        
	The BJP is officially in favour of small states. But the rash of demands in Uttar Pradesh and even Gujarat  states which the BJP does not want to carve up  appears to have prompted the party to counsel restraint to the Morcha at least until the tripartite talks scheduled for December 21 are over.        
	The serial bandh, which was in force in Darjeeling till 6 this evening, also set the stage for the first interaction in public between Jaswant and L.K. Advani since the expulsion.        
	In Parliament, Jaswant, the Morcha-backed MP, asked the House and Advani in particular to intervene to defuse the situation in the hills.        
	People of Darjeeling have fought for India and have been our saviours for years. This is an emotional issue for them, the former foreign minister said. He urged Advani not to forget the party manifesto. The party manifesto had said it would sympathetically examine the long-pending demands of the Gorkhas.        
	Advani responded, saying he was meeting representatives from Darjeeling.        
	A four-member Morcha delegation led by general secretary Roshan Giri met Advani and Sushma Swaraj.        
	In Darjeeling, Morcha president Bimal Gurung said: L.K. Advani and Sushma Swaraj called me up today and requested us to lift the strike. A similar message had also been sent by P. Chidambaram and by Jaswant Singh. We will respect their requests.        
	Bengal home secretary Ardhendu Sen said the state government was happy. However, they are continuing with the hunger strike and two people have fallen ill, he added. We are concerned about the situation and it is not conducive for the tripartite talks.        
	Morcha leaders said they had also kept in mind outgoing governor Gopalkrishna Gandhis departure-eve appeal to join the talks.        
	Gurung, however, warned that if the December 21 meeting didnt yield satisfactory results, he would intensify the agitation and start an indefinite hunger strike involving schoolchildren.        
	Morcha leader Amar Lama said the delegation had received positive indications from Chidambaram.        
	We cannot always look at pressure tactics. They can be used only to a certain extent, Lama said. The statement appeared to suggest the Morcha didnt expect a Telangana-like announcement anytime soon.

          SUMAN K SHRIVASTAVA                               
	Ranchi, Jan. 28: Governor Syed Sibtey Razi has ordered a vigilance probe into alleged irregularities in examinations conducted by the Jharkhand Public Service Commission to recruit 60 deputy collectors, thereby setting the tone of the kind of administration he would like to head under Presidents rule.        
	According to a communiqu issued by Raj Bhavan today, the governor approved a proposal mooted by the personnel department to have the state vigilance inquire into JPSCs bungling while conducting the first limited examinations for recruiting deputy collectors from among government staff in April 2006.         
	Todays move comes after the former Shibu Soren government ignored Raj Bhavans earlier directive to conduct a probe into allegations of foul play levelled by the special branch.        
	But, the personnel department swung into action after the imposition of Presidents rule and resurrected the issue, leading to Razi himself ordering a vigilance probe in the matter.        
	The results of the competitive examinations, in which over 7,500 government employees appeared, had to be withheld after .P. Khare, the then IG, Special Branch, reported that examinees at three centres  RTC High School, Anita Girls High School, Kanke and Hinoo United School  had resorted to malpractice.        
	Thereafter, Ratan Tirkey, the Jharkhand Janadhikar Party president, filed a PIL in high court seeking a probe. The court, however, rejected his petition.        
	The JPSC, too, did not evaluate the papers.         
	As a result, state government employees who took the exams were denied promotions to the rank of deputy collector for over three years.        
	According to sources in the JPSC, soon after the IGs letter was made public, the JPSC sought a report from the district administration as well as the exam superintendents at the three centres.         
	But, all of them refuted the inspector-generals allegations.

          K.P.S. GILL      
	The concluding part of K.P.S. Gills series on Lalgarh.                    TRUTH ABOUT
    LALGARH 4      
	Counter-insurgency responses in India  and the broader discussion regarding these  never fail to astonish me.        
	India has such a long history of insurgency and terrorism, and yet so little seems to be learned, not just by policy makers but by the police and security forces leaderships as well.        
	It is, indeed, a mystery to me why the West Bengal government has responded so tentatively, so slowly and so ineptly, both to the wider challenge of progressive Maoist consolidation in the state and to the long-drawn crisis in Lalgarh.        
	This is all the more scandalous in view of the fact that the Marxists have themselves engineered the most astonishing counter-insurgency success in Tripura in circumstances that are extraordinarily more complex and challenging than any that prevail in West Bengal.        
	Yet, it is clear, the party mechanism has learned nothing from this experience, and has certainly failed to communicate its key components to party leaders in other states, or at the Centre, all of whom continue to regurgitate exhausted platitudes about political and developmental solutions  the now-established alibis for doing nothing.        
	Indeed, very few even in Indias police leadership display any awareness of the contours of the extraordinary victory in Tripura against one of the most virulent insurgencies in the country.                  A jawan on vigil in Lalgarh on Sunday. (PTI)      
	In Andhra Pradesh, similarly, after long years of fitful struggle  with political solutions intervening repeatedly to wipe out the gains secured through great sacrifices by the police  the state has inflicted overwhelming reverses on the Maoists (though some difficulties persist along the Andhra-Orissa border).        
	Unfortunately, the only lesson drawn from this experience by Indias security establishment, it seems, is encapsulated in one word: Greyhounds.         
	The entire success has been attributed to this special force. The virtual reinvention of the police and intelligence apparatus, which created the environment for effective special force operations, and which directly neutralised a considerable proportion of the terrorist threat, remains largely unknown.        
	Both the Tripura and Andhra experiences  while they evolved in vastly different circumstances and applied to insurgencies that had unique characteristics of their own  drew their principal strategies from the Punjab experience.        
	This has, unfortunately, largely been lost in a vicious campaign of denigration of Punjab police and the security forces who participated in what is certainly one of the worlds most significant  and humane  counter-insurgency victories.        
	It is not possible here to analyse in any detail the components of these three crucial counter-insurgency successes. At core, however, their underlying principles included the realisation that a police-led response is the most effective method of dealing with insurgency and terrorism, and for this, effective police and police intelligence capacities had to be created.        
	West Bengal fails abysmally at the stage of this first principle itself. For instance, West Bengal has a police-population ratio of just 92 per 100,000 against an Indian average of 125. The ground reality is worse, since there is a 24 per cent deficit against sanctioned strength, leaving just 70 policemen per 100,000 population. The crisis at leadership level is worse.        
	In the armed police, for instance, there is a deficit of 35 per cent between the ranks of senior superintendent of police and deputy superintendent of police, and 37 per cent in the ranks between inspector and assistant inspector of police.        
	The police are ill-equipped, poorly trained, and have almost no capacities to handle an organised insurgent movement, particularly one as coherent as the Maoists. No force can effectively perform even the minimal tasks of peacetime policing with such a manpower and resource profile.        
	It is crucial to realise that all other solutions  to the extent that they actually exist  including the political and developmental, are predicated on security. It is impossible to implement such solutions where the state has lost control.        
	The Marxists should understand this after having lost, according to one report, at least 74 cadres to Maoist annihilation in just the West Midnapore district since 2002.        
	This needs to be understood before any solutions can be rightly assessed: the most appalling demonstrations of violence lie at the heart of the Maoist strategy. I have seen the Maoists engage in the most brutal manner of killing, clearly intended not merely to end the life of the target but to terrorise large populations into compliance.        
	It is through this tactic that the Maoists establish their disruptive dominance  not their control over areas, but the ability to dislocate the states capacities for governance.        
	If the state is to restore its capacities, it has to demonstrate clearly that violence will not pay, and that it can exercise its will over its entire jurisdiction.        
	The state must not hesitate in the condign and lawful use of force. I recall one incident in Punjab that drove this point home with utmost intensity.        
	An old man in one of the villages I was touring after a terrorist incident admitted that certain wrongs were committed by the police from time to time, but added: There are always limits to what the police can do; but there are no limits whatsoever on what the militants can do.         
	The state cannot allow its people to be abandoned to the limitless violence of the Maoists.

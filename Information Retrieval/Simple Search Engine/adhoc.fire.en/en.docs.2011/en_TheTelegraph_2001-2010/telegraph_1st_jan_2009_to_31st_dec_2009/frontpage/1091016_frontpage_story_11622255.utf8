	Lahore, Oct. 15: A wave of terror attacks by bands of suspected Taliban militants pulverised Pakistans security apparatus for the second time in less than a week, the terrorists striking with impunity in commando-style raids within sniffing distance of the Indian border.         
	The militants, most of them dressed in police uniforms, simultaneously attacked three law enforcement agencies in Lahore, the fifth major strike in Pakistan in a little over a week and five days after an audacious assault on the army headquarters in Rawalpindi.         
	Todays attacks on the regional hub of the Federal Investigation Agency and two police training centres  located within 8-12km of the border with India  started around 9.15am (9.45am IST) as Lahore, which, along with Karachi, is the economic nerve-centre of the country and its cultural bedrock, was getting ready for the day.         
	At least 19 people were killed, among them 14 police officers and five civilians, but the toll could rise. Ten militants were either killed or they blew themselves up. It was not clear if some gunmen managed to escape in the melee.         
	Further shaking the country, a suicide car bomber rammed his vehicle into a police station in the northwestern city of Kohat. At least 10 people were reported killed, including three police officers. Later, a car bomb was set off in Peshawar, killing a child and wounding 10.        
	The Tehrik-e-Taliban Pakistan, which has taken responsibility for other recent strikes, has owned up to the Lahore attacks, according to Geo TV.         
	The attacks today also were the latest to underscore the growing threat to Pakistani Punjab, the countrys political and economic heartland, and India, which is less than an hours drive from Lahore.        
	The enemy has started a guerrilla war, interior minister Rehman Malik said. The whole nation should be united against these handful of terrorists, and God willing we will defeat them.        
	The attacks began about 9am when a single gunman wearing civilian clothes and a suicide vest burst into the offices of the Federal Investigation Agency, the national law enforcement body that deals with matters ranging from immigration to terrorism, and began shooting, said Rana Sanaullah, the law minister of Punjab.         
	The gunman killed two men and four civilians and was mowed down by guards before he could detonate his explosives, Sanaullah said.                    
	The FIA is in charge of investigating the Pakistan-end of the Mumbai attacks case. Some 50 staff members were in the building, on Temple Road in the heart of Lahore, which is in ruins after being bombed in March 2008.        
	Soon after, at least four gunmen raided the Manawan police training school on the outskirts of the city  and around 12km away from Wagah  killing 11 officers and recruits.         
	Police officers and army rangers mounted a counterassault and exchanged fire for more than two hours. All the attackers were killed, three of them blowing themselves up. There were unconfirmed reports of three female fighters among the attackers.        
	This is the second time this year that the school for fresh recruits has come under militant attack. On March 30, 12 people died during an eight-hour militant standoff in the facility.        
	Mohammed Shahdab, a trainee at the Manawan school who was hit by a bullet in the leg, said the militants, all under-20, were screaming to another: Kill them all, dont let any one of them go, they are our enemies, they are enemies of Islam.        
	Around the same time, a third team scaled the back wall of a police commando training centre at Bedian, about 6km from the Allama Iqbal International Airport towards the border with India, though not in the same direction as Wagah.        
	The attackers stood on the roof of a building housing families of the trainees, shooting at security forces and throwing grenades, said Lt. Gen. Shafqat Ahmad, the top military officer in Lahore.         
	A police officer and a civilian were killed along with five gunmen. Three of the attackers blew themselves up and two, including one who was about 16, were shot by snipers.         
	The coordinated attacks resemble a pattern that began with the Mumbai terror strikes last year and was evident during last Saturdays assault on the army hub as well. The attackers are young, armed with guns and grenades and carry dry fruits, apparently preparing to dig in for a long siege.        
	The string of attacks appeared to be timed ahead of an offensive by the Pakistani Army against the headquarters of the Pakistani Taliban in South Waziristan, and appeared to send an ominous signal that the militants were daring the army to come and get them.         
	Last Saturday, militants stormed the army headquarters in Rawalpindi and held 42 hostages for nearly 20 hours, a severe embarrassment to the military, the most revered institution in Pakistan.         
	The style of the assaults seemed to demonstrate that the new Taliban leader, Hakimullah Mehsud, remained aligned closely to al Qaeda and was receiving technical training, planning and support for the attacks from the organisation. Baitullah Mehsud, the previous Taliban leader, was killed in an American missile strike in August.         
	This was borne out by the statement of Adeel, a police recruit at Manawan. He said the terrorists, clad in the black uniform of the elite police force, were agile, quick and their movements were calculated. They were fully trained and had the agility of commandos. I saw many of my colleagues blowing up in the air after the grenade attack, he said.

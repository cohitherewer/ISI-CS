          OUR BUREAU                            Amar Singh, AB Bardhan                                  
	New Delhi, Feb. 2: Prime Minister Manmohan Singh has requested the Congress not to nettle the Samajwadi Party until this months Parliament session to take a vote-on-account is over.        
	Sources said Singh did not want to upset or provoke leaders of the Samajwadi Party into threatening to review support as the UPA is critically dependent on that party for its majority.        
	Since the vote-on-account is a money bill, a defeat would amount to a no-trust vote and could bring the government down, parliamentary ministry sources said. We would not like to end our innings this way, a source said.        
	Samajwadi general secretary Amar Singh gave the Congress its first real jitters when he called on CPI general secretary A.B. Bardhan today.        
	This was the first formal meeting between them after their parties split last July over the nuclear deal.        
	We are old friends and colleagues. He came over and discussed the prevailing situation, Bardhan said.        
	Left sources quoted Amar as telling Bardhan that though seat-sharing talks with the Congress were on, it could be unreliable. Amar was unavailable to confirm this.        
	Amar also told him the Congress would be given 15 seats in Uttar Pradesh and, along with new ally Kalyan Singh, the allies could win 30-35 of the 80 seats.        
	He said he would call on Prakash Karat shortly. But the CPM general secretary said Amar had not sought him out yet.        
	A political re-alignment, however, seems on the cards with the Samajwadi signalling to the Congress that if push comes to shove it could always patch up with the Left.        
	Whether the alliance shapes up before or after the parliamentary polls will depend on:        
	How the Congress-Samajwadi alliance pans out. If it falls through, the Samajwadi may pursue the Left seriously and return to the inchoate third front floated by the Left;        
	The Samajwadi sees an opening for itself in this anti-Congress, anti-BJP front because Mayavati, supposed to be the nucleus, has practically rejected a pre-poll alliance with the Left and others like the Telugu Desam and the ADMK;        
	The Samajwadis need to align with a secular front to shake off the communal baggage that Kalyan has brought from the Babri era.

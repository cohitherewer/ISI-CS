                                                                                                           Docked: sports car fine on Dhoni
          AMIT GUPTA                         Dhonis Hummer				             Dhoni                                
	Ranchi, Oct. 8: Mahendra Singh Dhoni will be fined Rs 100 for delay in the registration of his Hummer H2 sports utility vehicle (SUV).         
	The Team India skipper is also on a sticky wicket with his Harley-Davidson: he is yet to submit a road worthiness certificate by the makers of the bike. That is necessary to have it registered.        
	He will be fined Rs 100 for the delay in applying for registration for the SUV. The norm is to apply for registration within seven days of purchase. Dhoni failed to do so. Its a normal process being followed by one and all, said A.K. Banka, the district transport officer of Ranchi.        
	However, according to another official of the transport department, Dhoni had applied for the registration of the Hummer within the stipulated time, but the form submitted was incomplete.        
	Transport office sources said Dhoni had opted for a number of his choice, a combination of his lucky number 7, and there was a high possibility that he would get it.        
	The Rs 100 fine for an SUV said to have cost him Rs 1 crore, including the high import duty, may not pinch the skippers pocket, but he could face a bigger hole if he continues to drive around in the numberless luxury vehicle. Under the motor vehicles act, the penalty increases to Rs 4,500 after the initial fine, the official said.        
	On the Harley-Davidson, Banka said the registration number could not be issued till the road-worthiness certificate was furnished.         
	First, the maker certifies whether the bike is fit for driving on a particular road. Then we send a motor vehicle inspector to assess the fitness of the vehicle. After that, we issue a fitness certificate, following which the registration is done, Banka said.         
	Speedster R.P. Singh had accompanied Dhoni when the captain had driven the Hummer from Lucknow to Ranchi on July 30.         
	Harbhajan Singh is the only other cricketer to own the SUV, made by US auto giant General Motors.        
	This is the second time Dhoni faces a penalty in connection with cars or for flouting driving rules. Three years ago, a traffic policeman had fined him for driving a car with tinted window panes, which is banned in Ranchi.         
	Dhoni was unaware of the curbs, which came into force when he was out of town on India duty.

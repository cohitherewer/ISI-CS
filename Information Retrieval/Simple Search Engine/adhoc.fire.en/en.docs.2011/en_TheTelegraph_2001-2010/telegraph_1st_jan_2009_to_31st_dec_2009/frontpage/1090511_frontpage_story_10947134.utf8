	Anti-American rhetoric is back in Bengal as never before in recent elections.         
	From obscure, little villages in far corners of the state to congested lanes in small towns like Howrah and Asansol to the slums in Calcutta, the Left is warning people against an American takeover of Indias foreign policy. See how the Congress government of Manmohan Singh signed the civilian nuclear deal with the Americans, the crowds at Left meetings are told.         
	It is the same Americans who destroyed Iraq, invaded Afghanistan and are waging a war against the whole Islamic world, Left campaigners, including Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee, tell crowds at election rallies.         
	The anti-American cry in Bengal this time betrays one of the Lefts main anxieties in these elections. All independent surveys and analyses have one thing in common about Bengals vote this time  that the Left has lost a substantial chunk of its Muslim support.        
	Recent election results, starting with the 2008 panchayat polls, confirm the trend across the state where Muslims account for 26 per cent of the population and where Muslims hold 30 per cent of farmland.         
	The CPM has good reasons to be worried about the Muslim vote this time. The Oppositions campaign over the Singur-Nandigram issues whipped up fears that poor Muslim peasants would be the worst victims of the Left Front governments policy to acquire farmland for industry.         
	Although the number of Muslims among the landlosers in Singur was very small, the large Muslim population in Nandigram, where no land was actually acquired, helped the Opposition campaign. It was aided in no small measure by Muslim leaders like Siddiqullah Choudhury and stirred up anti-CPM passions among Muslims elsewhere, especially in south Bengal.         
	Adding insult to the CPMs injury came the Sachar Committee report. The timing of its publication coincided with the Oppositions Nandigram charge. Even if the Marxists can attribute the Opposition campaign over land to the latters political motives, they have problems defending themselves against the Sachar Committees finding that the Left Front government has done precious little to improve the socio-economic conditions of Bengals Muslims.        
	CPM leaders argue that the committees report is flawed because it reflects the position of Muslims only in government jobs. It is simply wrong, they say, to ignore the fact that 25 per cent of the land distributed to the landless in the state went to Muslims or that Muslims could account for 8 per cent of the jobs in the police force and so on.        
	But even party leaders know the defence does not assuage the sense of injustice and deprivation that the Opposition has managed to stir among Muslims with the help of the committees report.         
	It is not that the social and economic backwardness of Muslims in Bengal had been unknown before the Sachar Committee exposed it. But the current political context has given it a new focus, thereby strengthening the Oppositions argument.        
	Add to all this the change in the Oppositions political profile this time. Unlike in the 2004 Lok Sabha and the 2006 Assembly polls, the Trinamul Congress this time has the Congress, and not the BJP, as its ally. With the 2004 polls coming in the wake of the Gujarat riots and Mamata Banerjee choosing the BJP as her ally, Muslims had little choice but to support the Left.        
	The CPMs Rajya Sabha MP, Moinul Hassan, does not agree that Muslims vote en bloc, as is commonly assumed. His own experience in the 2004 polls was different, though. He suffered a surprise defeat in the Murshidabad parliamentary seat primarily because of a campaign in the constituency over a book he wrote on reforms in Islam.        
	Political parties and Muslim leaders agree, however, that there is a difference between the voting patterns of Urdu-speaking Muslims in urban areas of Bengal and of the Bengali-speaking Muslims in rural constituencies.        
	Bengali-speaking Muslims, most of whom live on agriculture, are known to vote more on political lines than their Urdu-speaking counterparts in urban areas such as Calcutta, Howrah and Asansol. There is also a difference between, they say, between the communitys political choices in north and south Bengal.        
	Most of the Muslim votes shifting away from the Left are in south Bengal districts, where Trinamul has improved its position over the Singur-Nandigram agitations. The fear of losing farmland to new industries is behind this shift more in south Bengal than in the north.        
	Having faced this shift in the panchayat polls last year, CPM leaders are worrying how big it can be in these elections. Most opinion polls predict that the Left could lose some of its supposedly safe seats if the shift turns out to be as big as 10 per cent.        
	The anti-American rhetoric this time is one of the Lefts desperate games to try and recover lost ground among Muslims. But then, America-bashing has long lost its shine in Left politics in Bengal. It may not be worth much as a vote-gathering ploy.

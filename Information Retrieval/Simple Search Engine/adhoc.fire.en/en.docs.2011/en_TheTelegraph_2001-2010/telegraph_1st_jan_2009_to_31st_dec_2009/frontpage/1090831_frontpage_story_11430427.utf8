	Kokrajhar, Aug. 30: Kamtapur Liberation Organisation chief Jiban Singhs sister and brother-in-law were arrested in an early morning operation from Kokrajhar today, giving police some hope of extracting information about the rebel leader who is said to have links with Ulfa.        
	Acting on specific information, a team of Kokrajhar police and 19 Madras Regiment, surrounded a house on the fringe of Chakrashila Wildlife Sanctuary late last evening.        
	The couple, Sumitra Das and her husband, Dhananjoy Barman, who is a 2nd lieutenant in the outfit, had been taking shelter in a house belonging to a senior member of the All Koch Rajbongshi Students Union (Biswajit faction), Dalim Choudhury, with their two-year-old son.        
	As the forces closed in on the house in the wee hours today, Barman ran out and began firing, forcing the army to retaliate. As Barmans gun fell silent, the police inched closer. Wounded in the stomach, Barman was admitted to the first referral unit at Bongaigaon for treatment.        
	The gun-toting rebel out of the way, the police searched the house and arrested his wife, Sumitra. An Italian made 7.65mm pistol, four bullets, two mobile handsets, five SIM cards, including two Bangladeshi cards and Taka 100 were found on the couple.         
	The couple hail from Bolka Barobaisa of Jalpaiguri district in Bengal, about 150km from here.         
	After operation All Clear (Operation Flushout) in Bhutan, they went to Bangladesh and had been staying there. But they came back recently and were taking shelter in Dalim Choudhurys house, Kokrajhar police station officer in-charge Haren Das said.        
	Although the KLO has never been very active in Assam, it has a working relationship with Ulfa, which had helped the outfit find its feet in the initial stages after it was founded in 1996. The KLO provided logistical support to the Assam outfits members to find shelter in Bengal and also access to Bhutan.         
	At a news briefing today, Sumitra, now lodged in Kokrajhar police station with her son, said she and her husband received arms training in Bangladesh and that nearly 30-40 members of the outfit were still in that country. Jiban Singh, whose real name is Tamir Das, is also said to be taking shelter in Bangladesh.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Frontpage | Finger   at Yuvi riddle and IPL
                                                                                                           Finger   at Yuvi riddle and IPL
  - Fatigue on Kirsten lips          LOKENDRA PRATAP SAHI                            Dhoni                                              
	Nottingham, June 15: The boos at home, even though it was designated a home match for India, actually made England raise the level of their game phenomenally. But even the cheers at Lords, last evening, did nothing for the defending champions.         
	Long after the bars around crickets most revered address had emptied, the question still being asked was: How could the form-batter, Yuvraj Singh, be sent at No. 5 in an all-important Super Eight match?        
	Captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni had no proper answer, neither was coach Gary Kirsten very convincing. The bottom line is that the two coolest heads in the dressing room cracked under pressure.        
	That Yuvraj decision went a long way in ending Indias campaign in edition No. 2 of the World T20.        
	Mystifying.... Unbelievable, the batting order, former England quick Jonathan Agnew told The Telegraph, shaking his head.         
	Other factors contributed too, not least the moolah-earning IPL, which left the players physically and mentally compromised.        
	Virender Sehwags shoulder injury (thanks to the IPL) and his non-availability didnt help either.        
	The IPL, which involved 16 matches for players whose teams made the final, finished just days before Dhoni and Co. assembled in Mumbai for the flight to London.        
	Dhoni didnt offer the IPL as an excuse, but that didnt surprise as the tournament is controlled by the Board of Control for Cricket in India and its secretary, N. Srinivasan, runs the captains franchise  Chennai Super Kings.        
	The board, however, is driven only by the desire to add to its coffers and, so, nobody is going to raise questions which need to be asked.        
	Kirsten, to his credit, admitted that the players arrived tired and fatigue was definitely a factor, but not an excuse.        
	One hopes the board doesnt take him to task for being so candid.        
	Sure, India got beaten by the better team on the day, but few believed that 154 couldnt be achieved.         
	We were desperate to win and that desperation showed.... The lads put on a magnificent effort and our plans worked perfectly, remarked the unassuming Paul Collingwood, Englands captain.                    
	Collingwood ought to have sent a thank you note to Chris Gayle and Fidel Edwards. The hosts, after all, replicated the West Indies bodyline attack and earned dividends.        
	One of the ways to go against India is to be aggressive.... We did that.... Wed also been hurt by the (pre-match) booing, Collingwood added.        
	More than anything else, the Indians technical shortcomings at the top got exposed, ex-England captain Nasser Hussain was heard observing.        
	Indeed, yes, with MoM Ryan Sidebottom producing splendid spells to impact big.        
	Despite the stand taken by Dhoni and Kirsten, the team took to the World T20 in a distracted frame of mind. The unity parade, for example, was totally unnecessary.        
	Necessary, of course, was a solid session of nets on the eve of the England match. It had been scheduled, yes, but the Indians decided to stay away.        
	A point which needs to be stressed is that optional sessions may work for the Sachin Tendulkars. The lesser mortals, though, need to regularly train and the team management has to be firm instead of encouraging complacency.        
	Perhaps, even laziness.        
	Dhoni asserted that its not the end of the road. Of course, it isnt, but Team India could well end up on the same path if the many lessons arent learnt quickly.        
	One being that a spark of brilliance, like Yuvrajs stumping by specialist James Foster, may count for more than history and reputation.

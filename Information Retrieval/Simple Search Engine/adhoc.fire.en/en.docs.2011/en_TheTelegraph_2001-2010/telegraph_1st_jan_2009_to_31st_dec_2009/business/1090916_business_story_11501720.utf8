The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Tatas plan it big in Karnataka
                                                                                                               Tatas plan it big in Karnataka
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          H.M Nerurkar (left) and Harsh K. Jha in Calcutta on Tuesday. A Telegraph picture                                  
	Calcutta, Sept. 15: Tata Metaliks, Indias largest pig iron manufacturer, is planning a large steel plant in Karnataka.        
	Chairman Hemant Nerurkar said it would like to build a plant with a capacity of 3-5 million tonnes.        
	The company, a subsidiary of Tata Steel where Nerurkar is the executive director for the Indian and Southeast Asian operations, had earlier considered a 1mt plant.         
	However, it is now thinking big. It does not make sense to put up a small plant. So, we are looking at 3-5mt capacity. But nothing is finalised as yet, Nerurkar, who is tipped to take charge at Tata Steel when managing director B. Muthuraman retires this month, said.        
	The Karnataka government has identified 900 acres for the company. The state is also scouting for iron ore mines for a lease to Tata Metaliks.        
	Harsh K. Jha, managing director of Tata Metaliks, said the company would require 250-300 million tonnes of iron ore deposits.        
	Our investment is conditional upon getting iron ore mine lease there, Jha said.        
	Jha and Nerurkar were speaking to reporters after the 19th annual general meeting of Tata Metaliks.        
	The Calcutta-headquartered company had plans to put up a steel plant in Bengal, next to its existing pig iron plant at Kharagpur. It scrapped the project following a delay in land acquisition.        
	The Karnataka project would cost Rs 12,000-15,000 crore if the Tatas set up a 3mt plant. However, arranging finance could be a tough call for Tata Metaliks, which had a turnover of Rs 1,000 crore last fiscal. There is a possibility that Tata Steel may team up with it, given the magnitude of the project.

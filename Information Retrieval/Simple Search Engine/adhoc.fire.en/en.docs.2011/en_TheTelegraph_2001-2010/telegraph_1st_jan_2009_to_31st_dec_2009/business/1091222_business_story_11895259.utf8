The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Deora seeks bonds to help oil retailers
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Deora seeks bonds to help oil retailers
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Deora: Voicing concern                                  
	New Delhi, Dec. 21: Petroleum minister Murli Deora today said he had sought oil bonds worth about Rs 21,000 crore for state-owned refiners to compensate them for selling fuel below cost.        
	I met the Prime Minister with a request that oil bonds worth Rs 20,872 crore for April-December be issued immediately, Deora said.        
	We have not got any bonds in the last three quarters. It is not possible to continue like this, the minister said.         
	Bharat Petroleum and Hindustan Petroleum reported net losses in the second quarter, while IOC barely made a profit.        
	Finance secretary Ashok Chawla said, We are examining what will be the exact number, what will be the method of sharing the under-recoveries and finally the government will take a call.         
	Sources said petroleum and finance ministry officials would jointly work out a subsidy mechanism that would not come under pressure if international crude prices turned volatile.         
	The officials could suggest a formula to hike fuel prices if the crude moved beyond a sustainable level.        
	Officials said the formula would be discussed in the meetings of an expert group set up under noted economist Kirit Parikh to suggest a pricing policy for petroleum products. The expert group would submit its report by January.        
	The three PSU refiners are losing Rs 3.49 a litre on petrol, Rs 2.38 a litre on diesel, Rs 18.13 a litre on kerosene and Rs 250.67 per LPG cylinder.                    
	The government had earlier decided to compensate Indian Oil, Hindustan Petroleum and Bharat Petroleum for the losses they incurred on selling LPG and kerosene through the public distribution system by way of oil bonds. But the finance ministry has not issued any bonds for the last three quarters.        
	The oil companies are projected to lose about Rs 45,000 crore in revenues in full year. The official said under-recoveries on petrol and diesel amounting to Rs 4,003 crore had been compensated by ONGC, Oil India and GAIL (India) through discounts on crude oil and products sold to retailers. The government had in the last fiscal issued oil bonds worth Rs 71,292 crore.        
	Under the current system, the government issues bonds to oil marketing companies for its share of losses. The balance losses are split between oil marketing companies and ONGC and GAIL.

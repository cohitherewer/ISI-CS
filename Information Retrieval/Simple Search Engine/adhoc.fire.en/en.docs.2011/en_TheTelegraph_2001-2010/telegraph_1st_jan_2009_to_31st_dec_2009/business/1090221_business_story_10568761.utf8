The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Buyers keep off tobacco auctions 
                                                                                                               Buyers keep off tobacco auctions 
          G.S. RADHAKRISHNA                              
	Guntur (Andhra Pradesh), Feb. 20: The Tobacco Board on Friday suspended the auctions because there were no buyers at the initial price of Rs 100.        
	Chairman J. Suresh Babu, temporarily suspended the auctions till an agreement was reached with the Indian Tobacco Association over the price.        
	In the absence of prominent buyers such as ITC, there is a downward pressure on prices.        
	The auction was already delayed in Andhra Pradesh because of untimely rains. In Karnataka, farmers are yet to sell 7 million kg.        
	For tobacco grown in the Northern Light Soils region, the auction will now be on February 27, with 54 million kg on sale.        
	Central Black Soils and Northern Black Soils tobaccos will be sold on March 1.         
	Estimates for sales are 182 million kg from 45,000 growers compared with 162 million kg in the last season.        
	Auctions were introduced in 1985, while in Karnataka it was launched a year earlier.        
	The board fixes beforehand the area for production and the quantity, to discourage speculative over-production among the farmers.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | RIL denies curbs on gas supply
                                                                                                               RIL denies curbs on gas supply
                            
	New Delhi, Aug. 30 (PTI): Mukesh Ambani-led Reliance Industries Limited has asked the Centre to nominate users for incremental gas from its fields in the Krishna-Godavari basin, saying that it has not denied natural gas to any government-identified customer.        
	In a letter to petroleum secretary R.S. Pandey, RIL executive director P.M.S. Prasad said customers of about one-fourth of the initial 40 million cubic meters per day of gas were unable to draw because of failure at their ends.         
	Of the customers identified by the government, Essar, NTPC, Dabhol and GAIL (India) were yet to draw a single unit.         
	Anil Ambani group firm RNRL said RILs communication to the government was a conclusive evidence that there were no takers for the gas at the high prices offered by it.        
	An RNRL spokesperson said, RILs letter conclusively demonstrates that customers are not willing to buy gas at these high prices.                                                  
	NTPC is yet to sign a contract; Dabhol has signed a deal for the gas allocated but has not yet begun drawing.         
	Essar and GAIL are expected to start drawing by next month.                          
	Of the allocated quantity of 40 mmscmd, allocation to the extent of 9.4 mmscmd remains un-operational till date, he wrote. No customer who has been allocated gas by government, has been denied gas for reasons attributable to RIL.

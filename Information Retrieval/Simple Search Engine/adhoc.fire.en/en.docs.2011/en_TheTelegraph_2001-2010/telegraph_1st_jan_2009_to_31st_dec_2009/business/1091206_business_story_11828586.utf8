                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Global tea output drops
          SOUNAK MITRA                              
	Calcutta, Dec. 5: Global tea output is likely to be lower by about 140 million kg this year, 40 per cent more than the estimated 100 million kg shortage for the full year.         
	Tea-producing countries such as Africa, Kenya, India and Sri Lanka have suffered a sharp fall in output this year because of drought conditions during the producing months. In India, however, production has picked up in the last quarter because of improved weather conditions in the tea-growing regions.         
	According to statistics available, the deficit in Africa and Sri Lanka is now 70 million kg, while India is likely to end the year with a shortage of 50 million kg. Taking into account a 25 million kg shortage at the beginning of the year, the industry is staring at a shortage of a little more than 140 million kg.        
	Kenyas tea production during the January-October period declined 11 per cent to 242.2 million kg compared with the same period a year ago, according to the Tea Board of Kenya. Kenya is the largest exporter of black tea.        
	During the January-September period, world tea production stood at 1,275.5 million kg, down by about 89 million kg. Production in January-September fell 10 million kg to 696.7 million kg, a fall of 1.4 per cent over the last year. In the first five months of 2009, the shortfall in production over the previous year was almost 13 million kg.        
	Companies are hopeful that due to output shortage globally, Indias tea exports will grow by about 6 million kg during the full year.

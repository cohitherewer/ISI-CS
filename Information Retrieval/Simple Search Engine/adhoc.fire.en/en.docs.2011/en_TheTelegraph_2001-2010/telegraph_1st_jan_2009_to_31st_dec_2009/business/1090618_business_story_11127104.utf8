          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                               
	Mumbai, June 17: Wockhardt Ltd today sold its German business Esparma to Mova  a subsidiary of Lindopharm of Germany  for an undisclosed sum.         
	Wockhardt had acquired Esparma in May 2004 for $11 million.         
	The sale is seen as the first major step by the beleaguered pharmaceutical company to reduce its debt and restructure operations.        
	Wockhardt had suffered a loss of Rs 159 crore for the year ended December 2008, and the companys net debt stood at Rs 3,400 crore.         
	According to reports, the company plans to sell part of its hospital business (Wockhardt Hospitals) and its biotechnology and veterinary divisions.         
	Apollo Hospitals and Fortis Healthcare were keen on a stake in Wockhardt Hospitals. However, a senior executive of Apollo had recently said the firm was not interested anymore because of the high valuation of the assets.         
	The market is also speculating on Wockhardt selling its French subsidiary Negma Laboratories and Irish subsidiary Pinewood. Wockhardt had bought Negma for $265 million in May 2007 and Pinewood for $150 million in 2006.         
	Wockhardt, the countrys sixth largest drug maker by sales, is also planning to raise money to repay short-term loans and meet other liabilities.

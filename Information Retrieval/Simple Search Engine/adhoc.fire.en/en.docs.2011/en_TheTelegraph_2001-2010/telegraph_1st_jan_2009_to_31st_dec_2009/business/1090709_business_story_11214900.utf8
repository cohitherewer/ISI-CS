	New Delhi, July 8: The government is likely to add more than Rs 50,000 crore to its kitty from selling spectrum.        
	While the sale of third-generation (3G) spectrum will fetch Rs 35,000-44,000 crore, the auction of second-generation (2G) spectrum can add Rs 15,000-20,000 crore to government revenues.        
	According to budget estimates for 2009-10, the government expects to collect Rs 48,335.33 crore from telecom firms this fiscal, with 3G spectrum sales contributing Rs 35,000 crore to the kitty.        
	A senior finance ministry official said the Telecom Commission might take a call on selling 2G spectrum soon. The commission is preparing a road map for the auction of 2G spectrum.        
	With all operators offering 2G services, analysts said the auction could fetch Rs 15,000-20,000 to the exchequer.         
	Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and the finance ministry are in favour of the auction route for 2G spectrum allocation, in line with the global best practices. Industry players are also ready to bid for 2G spectrum.        
	The telecom sector needs a stable spectrum allocation policy. If the government decides on auction of additional spectrum (for 2G services), well align with the new policy, said Sunil Bharti Mittal, chairman and managing director of Bharti Airtel.        
	At present, operators become eligible for additional spectrum through a subscriber-based criteria.        
	According to Economic Survey 2008-09, the auction of 2G spectrum will improve the investment environment and drive growth in telecom.         
	On 3G spectrum, finance ministry officials said, The reserve price has been fixed at Rs 4,040 crore. Only a decision on the number of licences to be sold in each telecom circle needs to taken.         
	The finance ministry wants to allocate 10MHz of 3G spectrum to each player and auction only four licences.

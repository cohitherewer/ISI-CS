The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Govt favours base price for Satyam sale
                                                                                                               Govt favours base price for Satyam sale
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                          Gupta: Strict stance                                  
	New Delhi, March 3: The government feels there should be a base price for the auction of troubled infotech firm Satyam Computer Services.        
	The board will find a strategic investor for Satyam through an international competitive bidding within the next few weeks. We will not remove the reserve price in the bidding, P. C. Gupta, corporate affairs minister, told reporters.         
	Earlier, B. K. Modi, the chairman of Spice Corp, a prospective bidder, had said that a minimum reserve price was undesirable.         
	The CBI is investigating the case and new things about the companys liabilities are coming out every day. Fixing a minimum reserve price may not be ideal as the share price may fall if something drastic emerges during the period, Modi had said.        
	Gupta said the government-appointed Satyam board was expected to outline the bidding process and terms for the sale of a strategic stake within a few days.        
	He said the Satyam board would carry out the entire process in a transparent and competitive manner without any favour or disfavour to any bidder.        
	The induction of a strategic investor will infuse much-needed funds into Satyam, whose accounts are being restated.         
	Multiple agencies are investigating Satyams murky past following confessions of a Rs 7,100-crore fraud by B. Ramalinga Raju.        
	The company faces numerous lawsuits in the US, with one law firm reportedly threatening to an injunction against the strategic sale until the cases are resolved.        
	Analysts are, however, sceptical about the Satyam sale until its accounts are fully restated and the lawsuits cleared.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Refiners lobby for oil price hike
                                                                                                               Refiners lobby for oil price hike
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                             
	New Delhi, May 7: Oil refiners want an increase in fuel prices after the elections. The companies are reporting higher losses because of a rising gap between global crude prices and domestic retail rates.         
	Since the beginning of this month, the three state-run oil marketing firms  IOC, BPCL and HPCL  have been losing Rs 1.54 per litre on petrol. This is in addition to the losses on kerosene (Rs 11.80 per litre) and domestic LPG (Rs 87.99 per cylinder).         
	Though they have been making a profit of Rs 1.09 per litre on diesel, this margin, too, has been steadily declining, with crude prices soaring in the international market.         
	Global crude prices have risen nearly 25 per cent in the last nine weeks. They had fallen to a low of $35 a barrel in January-February and are now hovering around $54.        
	Through successive rounds of reduction in December and January, the government had lowered petrol and diesel prices by Rs 10 and Rs 4 per litre, respectively.         
	It had also reduced the price of cooking gas by Rs 25 a cylinder.         
	When fuel prices were cut in January, the Indian basket of crude was averaging $44 a barrel.         
	The government was contemplating another round of cuts before the Lok Sabha polls but had to drop the plan as global crude prices started moving up.         
	India imports around 80 per cent of its crude, which means global trends influence the domestic rates.         
	Analysts said that towards the end of the year, crude oil price might rise to $70, depending on the stability in the US and other global economies.         
	In a research note, Goldman Sachs said, The improvements in the leading economic indicators increase our confidence that a return to sequential economic growth in the second half of 2009 will support a rise in crude oil prices to $65 a barrel.         
	State-run oil marketing firms will face under-recoveries worth Rs 1,03,000 crore in 2008-09, petroleum secretary R.S. Pandey said.

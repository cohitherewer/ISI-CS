The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | New-found spring in sensex step
                                                                                                               New-found spring in sensex step
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                            
	Mumbai, Sept. 14: The markets are on fire once again. If the sensex is a barometer of its exuberance, then the Lehman spook has been finally laid to rest.        
	Investors, who had seen the value of their equity holdings disintegrate when the global markets went into a tailspin exactly a year ago, have finally some reason to rejoice.         
	The bullish fervour in the markets has dimmed memories of the dog days of 2008 with the sensex going into a steep decline after hitting a heady high of 20873 on January 8.        
	According to the Reserve Bank of India, the turbulence in global financial markets began to deepen in July when the US guarantors Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac reported a drop in the value of their assets. That sent the sensex skidding to 12576 on July 6 last year.        
	Even though the market recovered a little after that, the Lehman collapse saw the bellwether index tumble 469 points to 13531 on September 15 last year.        
	Bad news for the investing community did not end there as the disclosure of financial irregularities at Satyam Computer Services  an unrelated event  also saw shareholder wealth evaporate.        
	While the BSE sensex hit a low of 8160.40 points on March 9, it has since recovered to 16214.19.         
	Stocks have swelled and ebbed along with the tide of cash from financial institutional investors. In September 2008, FII outflows had risen $1.80 billion and then rose further to $3.15 billion. But with investors seeing value in Indian stocks, FII flows turned positive at $1 billion in August this year.        
	Market circles aver that there are two reasons responsible for this two-fold rise in the index and the jump in liquidity. At that point, the markets were highly oversold on fears that the world economy would sink into a depression. But it slowly became clear that this was not going to be the case. Moreover, central banks across the world aggressively pumped in money and that boosted the value of all asset classes including equities, says Apurva Shah, head of research (institutional equities) at Prabhudas Lilladher.        
	But theres a niggling worry now: some analysts wonder whether the markets are beginning to show signs of irrational exuberance once again with the benchmark index having run up over 65 per cent since March. They worry that this surge may not be warranted with the global economy not completely out of the woods.

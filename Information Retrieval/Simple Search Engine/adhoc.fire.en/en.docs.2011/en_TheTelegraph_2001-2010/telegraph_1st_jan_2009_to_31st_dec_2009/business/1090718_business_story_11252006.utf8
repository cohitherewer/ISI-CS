The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Govt wants say in RIL gas case
                                                                                                               Govt wants say in RIL gas case
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                          
	New Delhi, July 17: The government today approached the Supreme Court with a request to become a party to the gas dispute between the warring Ambani brothers.        
	The government approached the apex court after Mukesh Ambani-owned Reliance Industries Ltd filed an affidavit in which it said it could not supply gas from the D-6 well in the Krishna Godavari basin to Reliance Natural Resources without the approval of the government.        
	Last month, Bombay High Court had upheld RNRLs right to 28 million cubic metres of gas a day from the D-6 field at a concessional price of $2.34 per million British thermal units (mBtu). The government had fixed the price of gas at $4.20 per mBtu.        
	The apex court will start hearing on one of the most rivetting corporate battles from Monday. The battle has raged for close to three years.        
	In its affidavit, the government rejected the Ambani family pact for the carve-up of the empire that patriarch Dhirubhai Ambani had built, which was the basis on which Bombay High Court had passed its judgment.         
	The government asked the Supreme Court to allow Reliance to supply gas to customers other than RNRL.        
	The affidavit, filed by the petroleum ministry, sought a stay on the Bombay High Court order on the ground that it infringed the sovereign rights of the government as the owner of all petroleum resources.         
	The affidavit said the high court order had the effect of completely undermining the gas utilisation policy of the Government of India and the principle of pricing natural gas declared as a policy by the government.        
	The high court had ordered RIL to supply gas at the same price for 17 years.        
	It is not the private property of RIL and RNRL and any understanding arrived at between them is not binding upon the government, the affidavit said.        
	The government argued that the gas had to be distributed in terms of the policy approved by an empowered group of ministers.        
	Rejecting RNRLs contention that it was entitled to a particular quantity of gas, the affidavit said it was for the government to decide who was entitled to it.        
	The entire amount of gas would have to be approved, valued at the approved price to determine the entitlements of the government and the contractor (which in this case is RIL), the affidavit said.        
	The government said it had rejected a proposal by Reliance to supply gas to RNRL as it was not based on an arms length transaction.         
	It said the Bombay High Court order would lead to the fixation of two prices  one for RNRL and the other for public sector undertakings.        
	Such an interpretation would be violative of Article 14 of the Constitution of India, it said. Article 14 provides for equality before law and equal protection.         
	In its affidavit, RIL accused RNRL of taking contradictory stands in an attempt to mislead the Supreme Court.        
	It said the Anil Ambani groups claim to KG-D6 gas should be rejected as it did not have any plants capable of utilising the fuel.        
	It also submitted that any damages suffered by RNRL, if established, could be recompensed later.        
	It said the gas supplied at this stage to RNRL could be used only for the purpose of trading with third parties.

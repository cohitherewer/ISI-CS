                                                                                                               Recovery doubts rattle stocks     Markets in Mumbai, Shanghai suffer most
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                                  
	Mumbai, Aug. 17: Stocks stumbled on world markets with the bourses in China and India recording the sharpest falls at 6 per cent and 4 per cent, respectively, amid concern that equities had rappelled up too quickly this summer anticipating a global economic recovery that seemed too brittle now.        
	The BSE sensex  the markets bellwether index  gave up close to 627 points and ended sharply below the 15000-mark at 14784.92.        
	Market mavens blamed overseas factors for the sudden correction while admitting that the truant monsoon had also played its part in depressing values.        
	Investors, who had sounded confident of a recovery, looked less certain after last Fridays data in the US that showed weak consumer confidence. The Reuters/University of Michigan index of consumer sentiment declined to 63.2 in August, reigniting concerns about the US recovery.        
	The sombre mood that hung over the global markets wasnt dissipated by the news that Japan had climbed out of recession after Germany and France had indicated last week that the worst was over.        
	Japans gross domestic product had expanded at an annual 3.7 per cent in the three months ended June 30. However, the growth rate was lower than expectations expressed in a straw poll of economists that showed a median estimate of 3.9 per cent.        
	Investors have been really spooked by the indications coming out of China.        
	The voices coming out of China suggest that the government there will slap some controls or cap investments that go into asset growth. This has created fear in the minds of investors and stock markets reacted sharply, Hitesh Agrawal, head of research at Angel Broking, told The Telegraph.        
	The Shanghai Composite Index slumped 5.8 per cent at 2870.63  the biggest percentage loss since last November.         
	The Chinese slump was reflected in the sharp drop in the prices of metals and global crude.        
	Copper for delivery in three months fell 2.1 per cent to $6,115 a metric tonne on the London Metal Exchange, while crude oil retreated 2 per cent to $66.15 a barrel in New York.        
	The global turmoil was reflected on the local bourses when the sensex opened lower at 15284.23 against its last close of 15411.63.         
	With its Asian peers and the European indices drifting lower, the benchmark index slumped to a days low of 14740.63 and later ended the day at 14784.92, a drop of 626.71 points, or 4.07 per cent. Analysts added that the worry over the poor monsoons had also clouded sentiment.        
	Although valuations are now in the fair zone, we need upward triggers. However, that is not coming. The monsoons are also a negative overhang, Agrawal added.        
	On the BSE, realty, metal, oil amp; gas, auto and bank stocks led the slide. The BSE realty index recorded the sharpest loss with DLF plunging almost 8 per cent. Metal stocks such as Sterlite Industries were aggressively sold because of weak commodity prices. The Sterlite scrip closed nearly 7 per cent lower.         
	Heavyweights such as Reliance Industries and ICICI Bank tumbled 4.7 per cent and 5.3 per cent, respectively.        
	The selloff in the equity markets had its impact on the forex markets, also, with the rupee crashing 71 paise to close at a one-month low of 48.95/96 against the dollar.         
	Earlier, the rupee had fallen to an intra-day low of 49.02 per dollar. The currency had started the day sharply lower at 48.53/54 per dollar.

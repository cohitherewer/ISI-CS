          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                            
	Mumbai, Aug. 18: Housing Development Finance Corporation (HDFC) plans to raise Rs 4,300 crore through a simultaneous issue of equity warrants and non-convertible debentures to qualified institutional buyers.        
	The countrys largest disburser of housing loans said the maximum equity dilution on conversion of warrants into shares would be capped at 3.5 per cent of the expanded equity capital.         
	Shareholders of HDFC had given a blanket approval for a QIP issue on July 22 but it is only now that the details of the issue have been finalised. The equity warrant issue will raise Rs 300 crore.        
	At a board meeting held on Monday, the directors of HDFC decided to issue 109,53,706 warrants with the right to holders to convert each warrant into an equity share at any time before the expiry of three years from the date of allotment.         
	The board also decided to issue 20,000 zero per cent secured redeemable non-convertible debentures (NCDs) of the face value of Rs 10,00,000 each due in August 2011 for cash aggregating to Rs 2,000 crore and 20,000 zero per cent secured redeemable NCDs of the face value of Rs 10,00,000 each due in August 2012 for cash aggregating to Rs 2,000 crore.        
	Market circles said QIP investors could subscribe to either the warrants or NCD issue or both. HDFC is expecting a strong response to the issue, which may close on Thursday.         
	HDFC follows scores of companies such as Unitech, Bajaj Hindusthan, Indiabulls and HDIL that have floated QIP issues recently.        
	In its preliminary placement document, HDFC has said that funds garnered from the issue would be used to augment long-term resources.         
	Although HDFC is the largest housing finance company in India in terms of total assets and mortgage lending, it operates in a fiercely competitive market in which banks such as the State Bank of India (SBI) are now looking to make a major dent.         
	The SBI, the countrys largest bank, has quickly increased its market share in the home loan segment with attractive schemes. This comes at a time when another key player  ICICI Bank  has adopted a deliberate strategy to slow down its asset expansion. With the economy gradually coming out of a slowdown, it is expected that there will be more demand for housing loans in the months to come.         
	As of June 30, HDFCs outstanding mortgage loan portfolio amounted to Rs 88353.83 crore. Loan approvals for the quarter ended June 30 were put at Rs 12259 crore compared with Rs 9996 crore in the corresponding period in 2008, representing a growth of 23 per cent.         
	Loan disbursements rose 21 per cent to Rs 86,88 crore during the period compared with Rs 7204 crore in the corresponding period in 2008.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Power struggle                                  
	Calcutta, April 17: The Supreme Court has allowed Descon to participate in the divestment of power generator and distributor DPSC Ltd.        
	The court has also directed the Company Law Board (CLB) to wrap up the case between Descon and Andrew Yule within three months.         
	Descon  a city-based IT firm  is the single largest shareholder in DPSC, formerly Dishergarh Power Supply Corporation Ltd. Descon and its parent Andrew Yule are locked in a legal battle over the ownership of DPSC.        
	Yule and domestic financial institutions such as the LIC and United India Insurance have put their combined 57.17 per cent stake in DPSC for sale.        
	Sixteen bidders, including Tata Power, Anil Ambanis Reliance Infrastructure, CESC, JSW Energy are in the fray for the company.         
	Yule has stopped short of calling price bids for DPSC following Calcutta High Courts verdict, which allowed the stake sale process to continue but restricted the transfer of shares to the successful bidder.        
	Yule chairman and managing director Kallol Datta said the company would decide on the calling of price bids next week. Descon managing director S. Radhakrishnan declined to comment as the matter was sub-judice.

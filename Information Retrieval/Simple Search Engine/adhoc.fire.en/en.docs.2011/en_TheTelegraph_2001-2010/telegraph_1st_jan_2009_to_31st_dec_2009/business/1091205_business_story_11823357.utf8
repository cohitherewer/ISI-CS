The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Wraps off GM pact with China partner
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Wraps off GM pact with China partner
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Dec. 4: US auto major General Motors today said it would enter the Indian commercial vehicles market through a partnership with Shanghai Automotive Industry Corporation (SAIC) of China.        
	Sources said the two partners might also explore the possibility of introducing a small car.         
	However, the company remained tight-lipped and said our focus is the commercial vehicle space. General Motors has entered into a collaboration with SAIC to develop and manufacture commercial vehicles and other competitive products for India and export markets, the company said.         
	The tie-up will give GM India access to mini-commercial vehicles and other products from the stable of GMs joint ventures in China.         
	These will be produced at GM Indias Talegaon and Halol facilities alongside GMs portfolio of models for India and the global markets, it said.        
	The statement, however, did not elaborate on SAIC picking up a 50 per cent stake in GM India. The collaboration, which is expected to be finalised shortly, would create more jobs in India. This (the tie-up) will give us an opportunity to utilise and expand our manufacturing capacities as we introduce additional products that are tailored to meet the needs of local buyers and driving conditions, GM India president Karl Slym said.        
	The deal follows the collaboration between GM India and Reva for electric vehicles.        
	Nick Reilly, president of GMs international operations, said over the past decade GM and SAIC had created one of the worlds most successful automotive industry partnerships in China and Korea.

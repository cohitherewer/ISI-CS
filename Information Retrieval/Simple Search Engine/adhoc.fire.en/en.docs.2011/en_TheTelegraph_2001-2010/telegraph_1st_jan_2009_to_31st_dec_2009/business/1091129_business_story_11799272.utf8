          OUR CORRESPONDENT                          Finance minister Pranab Mukherjee with Haryana chief minister Bhupinder Singh Hooda in Chandigarh on Saturday. (PTI)                                  
	Chandigarh, Nov. 28: Finance minister Pranab Mukherjee today said the Dubai debt crisis would not affect India much but the government was keeping a close watch and would act to prevent any fallout.        
	There is no need to panic over the potential adverse impact of the Dubai World crisis on Indias economy, Mukherjee said after delivering the P.N. Haksar Memorial lecture at the Centre for Research in Rural and Industrial Development here.        
	The state-run Dubai World had stunned the financial world on Wednesday when it announced it would need to restructure its debt, estimated at $59 billion, to pre-empt default and asked creditors for a six-month moratorium.        
	Mukherjee, however, said the situation developing in Dubai would be watched. Let us wait and watch what has exactly happened.        
	The impact cannot be much as our stake is so small and the amount involved compared to the world economy is miniscule, Mukherjee told reporters here.        
	Watchful and effective intervention at the appropriate time can avert some immediate crisis, he said.        
	On the issue of the large number of Indians working in the emirate, Mukherjee said, It will have to be seen how this affects Indians working in Dubai.        
	He, however, sounded confident saying, I dont think it will have much effect on Indian workers in that country.         
	Indians constitute as high as 42.3 per cent of the population of Dubai, he said.        
	Stimulus         
	Mukherjee said the stimulus measures that buoyed the economy in the wake of the financial crisis were unsustainable and the government would have a road map by December to consolidate its fiscal position over the next five years.        
	The firefighting policies by Asias third-largest economy have contributed to a bulging of the fiscal deficit to a projected 6.8 per cent of GDP for 2009-10.        
	This level of fiscal expansion can only be a short-term response and is unsustainable on a long-term basis, Mukherjee said.

	New Delhi, Aug. 25: The countrys largest car manufacturer, Maruti Suzuki India, today launched a variant of its small car Estilo. The car will now run on a more fuel efficient engine.         
	Powered by the K-series engine, the 998cc petrol Estilo comes at an introductory price ranging from Rs 3.12 lakh to Rs 3.95 lakh (ex-showroom, Delhi).        
	Maruti is planning to upgrade all its models to Bharat Stage-IV emission standard by March 2010.        
	The company also expects sales to grow by over 10 per cent during current fiscal.

	Maruti sold over 7.22 lakh vehicles in the domestic market in 2008-09.

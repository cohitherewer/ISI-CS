The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Bourses stay ahead of moves
                                                                                                               Bourses stay ahead of moves
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                               
	Mumbai, Feb. 22: The Satyam boards approval to a 51 per cent stake sale yesterday is unlikely to have any major impact on the movement of the beleaguered firms stock.        
	Analysts say the recent developments have largely been factored into the stocks current value. Investors, however, will be keen on the terms of an open offer.        
	Last week, the Satyam stock fell around 7.7 per cent. It closed at Rs 49.25 on Friday.         
	The Satyam stock may continue to hover around the current levels, though one cannot rule out the possibility of a spike. But this could come only after more details on the process of the sale is known, an analyst, who did not wish to be identified, said.         
	Meanwhile, the World Bank has said it would now reveal a vendors name which it debarred from doing business as soon as it took the decision.        
	Announcements will be made at the time of a finding that a vendor is debarred, or in other words, determined to be a non-responsible vendor, a World Bank official said.        
	The bank temporarily suspended Satyam in February 2008 and after a detailed probe, the IT firm was debarred in September.

	New Delhi, July 2: The auction and trading of second-generation (2G) spectrum will improve the investment environment and drive growth in telecom, according to Economic Survey 2008-09.        
	The survey also suggested that spectrum allocation be delinked from a telecom licence.         
	At present, on paying Rs 1,650 crore for a pan-India telecom licence fee, GSM and CDMA operators get 4.4MHz and 2.5MHz of start-up spectrum per circle, respectively.        
	The 2G auction price can be in the form of a fixed price or charge per unit of bandwidth per annum or a combination of the two, the survey said.        
	On third-generation (3G) spectrum, the survey said, The auctioned 3G spectrum must be freely tradable with capital gains on spectrum to be taxed under the income tax Act. The government plans to raise Rs 30,000-40,000 crore from 3G auction, which will help it plug a widening fiscal deficit. The auction is likely to be completed by year-end.         
	On the emphasis on spectrum trade, telecom analyst Mahesh Uppal said, Spectrum in India is leased to operators at a subsidised rate. If it is allowed to be resold at market prices, the government may decide to charge a tax as it does for land transfer deals.

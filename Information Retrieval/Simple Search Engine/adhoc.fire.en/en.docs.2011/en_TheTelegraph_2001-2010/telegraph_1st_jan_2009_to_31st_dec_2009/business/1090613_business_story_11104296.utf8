	Mumbai, June 12: Vedanta Resources Plc, the Anil Agarwal promoted metals and mining company, is raising its stake in iron ore producer Sesa Goa Ltd.        
	Vedanta today announced that it would subscribe to a preferential share issue by Sesa Goa that would take its stake to 55 per cent from 53.1 per cent.        
	Under this offer, Vedanta will subscribe to an additional 33,274,000 shares. Vedanta added that the total cash outlay to subscribe to the preferential offer was estimated to be $120 million. The transaction is subject to the approval of Sesas shareholders and is expected to be completed by July.        
	News of the acquisition and the preferential offer led to the Sesa Goa stock jumping 5.6 per cent to end at Rs 202.90 on the BSE today.        
	The development comes only a day after Sesa Goa announced the acquisition of VS Dempo amp; Companys mining assets in an all-cash deal of Rs 1,750 crore.         
	This deal will be funded by Sesa Goas existing cash resources which stand at over Rs 4,100 crore.        
	Post-acquisition, Sesa Goa will have the ownership right of the Dempo groups mining assets and related infrastructure such as processing plants, barges, jetties, transhippers and loading capacities at the Mormugoa port, and its position as the countrys largest iron ore exporter in the private sector will further be consolidated.

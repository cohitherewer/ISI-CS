The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Import ban on mobiles minus code
                                                                                                               Import ban on mobiles minus code
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Call barred                                  
	New Delhi, June 17: The government today banned the import of mobile handsets without the unique identity code that helps authorities track users.         
	The unique code, known as the international mobile equipment identity (IMEI), is a 15-digit number appearing on an operators network during a call.        
	Phones without an IMEI number are a security threat, with questions raised on their use during the terrorist attacks in Mumbai last year.        
	While the ban is applicable on handsets from all nations, in reality it will end up hitting Chinese phones.        
	It is a step in the right direction. However, there are handsets already in use which lack IMEI numbers. These should also be banned, said Pankaj Mahindroo, president of the Indian Cellular Association.        
	There are about 250 lakh Chinese handsets in India. GSM service providers, including Airtel and Vodafone, have said they will deny connectivity to phones without an IMEI number.        
	The government has also extended the ban on sub-standard toys to all countries and restricted import of milk products from China.        
	Most US and European firms comply with global norms on toy quality and have a very little market share in India. Officials said India had extended the import restriction on toys to all countries to stop China from taking the issue to the WTO. The government had banned toys from China in January but later modified the order.        
	Import of toys is prohibited up to January 23, 2010 and until further orders. However, toys conforming to international health safety standards can be imported, the directorate general of foreign trade said in a notification.        
	On the ban on milk products, a DGFT notification said, The government extends the prohibition on the import of milk and milk products, including chocolates and chocolate products and candies/confectionery/food preparations with milk or milk solids as an ingredient from China for a period of six months from June 24, 2009.         
	A dozen countries in Asia and Africa have banned milk and dairy products from China after a few infants and several thousand adults fell ill from consuming these products.        
	Officials said India did not import milk products from China, but the ban was a preventive measure.

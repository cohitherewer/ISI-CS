The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Fidelity earns a breather
                                                                                                               Fidelity earns a breather
          R. SURYAMURTHY                              
	New Delhi, Sept. 30: The government today gave a six-month breather to Fidelity International to lower its stake in Multi Commodity Exchange of India Ltd (MCX) to 5 per cent in compliance with the foreign investment norms.        
	Fidelity has a 9.21 per cent stake in MCX and holds 7.2 million shares in the exchange. According to sources, Fidelity has been talking to various private equity funds and international exchanges to sell part of its stake in MCX. A Fidelity spokesperson refused to comment on the progress of the talks.        
	Like MCX, foreign investors are selling their stakes in National Commodity amp; Derivatives Exchange Ltd. Shree Renuka Sugars Ltd had recently acquired a 5 per cent stake in the bourse from Intercontinental Exchange (ICE) and Goldman Sachs Investments (Mauritius) Ltd. Goldman Sachs Group and ICE held 7 per cent and 8 per cent in NCDEX, respectively.        
	The government, for the second time, has extended the deadline to meet foreign investment norms to March 31, 2010.         
	A single foreign investor cannot hold more than 5 per cent in a commodity exchange, within a overall foreign investment cap of 49 per cent.        
	The department of industrial policy and promotion (DIPP), however, said the latest extension would be the last opportunity for complying with the August 2008 guidelines that required the commodity exchanges to bring the overall foreign investment ceiling to 49 per cent. Portfolio investments share should be 23 per cent and FDI, 26 per cent. Over and above this, no foreign investor/entity is to hold more than 5 per cent.        
	Difficulties have been brought to the notice of the government in complying with the provisions within the stipulated time frame, the DIPP said in its latest Press Note 7 of 2009. Non-compliance would be a violation of the Foreign Exchange Management Act, 1999.        
	The original deadline of June 30, 2009, was first extended to September 30.        
	All commodity exchanges will have to inform the DIPP, department of consumer affairs, Foreign Investment Promotion Board, Forward Markets Commission and Securities and Exchange Board of India about their foreign investment structure. According to the Forward Markets Commission, the value of commodities traded on exchanges may jump 20 per cent in the current fiscal . The value of commodities traded till August-end was Rs 27.3 lakh crore, 31 per cent more than last year .         
	With commodity trading on bourses going up manifold, a new Indian Commodity Exchange has applied for a licence and is expected to begin trading in gold, natural gas, soybean oil and seven other items by the end of October, company sources said.         
	Indian Commodity Exchange Limited is promoted by Indiabulls Financial Services Ltd and MMTC Limited.

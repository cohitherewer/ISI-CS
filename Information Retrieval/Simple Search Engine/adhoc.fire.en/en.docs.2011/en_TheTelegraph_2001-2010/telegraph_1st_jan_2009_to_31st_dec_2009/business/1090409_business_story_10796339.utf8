                                                                                                               Banks plan to cut rates in May 
  Yield on deposits to fall          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                           Narayanasami: Hopeful                                        
	Mumbai, April 8: Public sector banks may again bring down lending rates by 50 basis points next month.         
	However, a cut in lending rates will come only after a reduction of 50-75 basis points in deposit rates, said T.S. Narayanasami, chairman of the Indian Banks Association, here today.         
	(The) cost of deposits (is) still high. This will have to come down first. Then only (will) the lending rates ease, he said.         
	 Narayanasami, who is also the chairman of the Bank of India, said more banks could reduce deposit rates over the next two weeks to bring down their cost of funds.         
	The IBA chief was speaking to reporters after a pre-credit policy meeting with Reserve Bank of India governor Duvvuri Subbarao and other officials of the central bank. The RBI is set to announce the policy on April 21.         
	The central bank has been reducing key rates such as the reverse repo and repo since October to signal a lower interest rate regime and revive the economy.         
	Subbarao had earlier indicated that banks were not cutting rates to the extent desired even after the RBI had gone on cutting its key policy rates.        
	 Private banks have been complaining of falling prices of government paper which are causing mark-to-market losses and preventing them from cutting rates.         
	Mark-to-market is an accounting process, under which banks record the value of an asset, such as a bond, at its current market value, which may differ from its purchase price. The government is selling bonds in the market to finance its expenditure, causing their prices to fall.        
	Recently, Axis Bank and the Bank of Rajasthan brought down their prime lending rates by 25-50 basis points. This came after four public sector banks  Allahabad Bank, Oriental Bank of Commerce, United Bank of India and Uco Bank lowered lending rates by 25-50 basis points.         
	Narayanasami expects the prices of government securities to soften in the coming days. He said the central bank had been managing the governments borrowing programme efficiently.         
	At the meeting with the governor, the bankers raised the issue of rising non performing assets.        
	They also told the RBI that they expected credit growth to moderate to 18-20 per cent in the current fiscal, below the 25-30 per cent growth recorded in the last financial year.

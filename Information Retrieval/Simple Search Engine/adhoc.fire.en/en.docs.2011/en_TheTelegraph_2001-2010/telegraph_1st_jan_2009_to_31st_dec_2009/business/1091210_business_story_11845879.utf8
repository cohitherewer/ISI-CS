The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | VW to pick up 20% in Suzuki 
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      VW to pick up 20% in Suzuki 
  - German car maker sets sights on top spot                                              
	Tokyo/Frankfurt, Dec. 9 (Agencies): Germanys Volkswagen AG will buy a 20 per cent stake in Suzuki Motor, in a $2.5-billion deal that is aimed at tapping the Japanese firms expertise in small cars and dominance in India as VW seeks to become the No.1 auto maker.        
	The move is the second coup this week for ambitious VW chairman Ferdinand Piech, coming on the heels of the German car makers 3.9-billion-euro ($5.8 billion) purchase of a 49.9 per cent stake in sports car maker Porsche.        
	Piechs top lieutenant, VW chief executive Martin Winterkorn, was hopeful the Suzuki alliance would help catapult the Wolfsburg-based car maker past industry leader Toyota Motor Corp ahead of plan. If that succeeds faster (than 2018), were happy, a grinning Winterkorn told reporters as he sat next to Suzukis nearly 80-year-old CEO Osamu Suzuki at a Tokyo press conference.        
	CEO Suzuki repeated that he did not intend the company he had led for three decades to come under VWs control.        
	I dont want you to misunderstand: Suzuki is not becoming a 12th brand for Volkswagen, Suzuki said when asked whether the company might get a German CEO in the future. I dont want other folks telling me how to do things.        
	With the global car industry still facing fragile demand, overcapacity and stricter environmental regulations, auto makers are joining forces to save billions each would need to develop powertrains.        
	PSA Peugeot Citroen of France and Japans Mitsubishi Motors Corp said this month they were exploring deeper ties which had so far been limited to a project-based partnership.        
	The latest deal will see Suzuki invest up to half the proceeds in a cross-shareholding through the roughly 100-billion-yen ($1.13 billion) purchase of a 2.5 per cent voting stake in VW.        
	This comes right after the Mitsubishi deal and shows that foreign car makers are coming to take stakes in Japanese firms, raising expectations of a reorganisation in the auto sector, said Noritsugu Hirakawa, a strategist at Okasan Securities.        
	Suzuki shares rose 3.5 per cent in a weaker Toyko market. Volkswagen rose 2.9 per cent in Germany and were up 1.5 per cent by 1153 GMT, the leading gainer among German blue chips.        
	VW, which is also the No.1 car maker in China, the worlds largest auto market, would provide Suzuki the technology to make the hybrid and electric cars it lacks in its line-up. In partnership with Suzuki, the VW group can take a big step forward in the compact car segment, particularly in emerging markets in Asia, Winterkorn said. In turn, Suzuki can benefit from our experience with efficient and environmentally friendly drive-train and vehicle technologies, Winterkorn added.        
	Changing landscape        
	Volkswagen with its 10 brands, including Audi, Skoda, Seat and Porsche, has said it wants to become the worlds No.1 auto maker by 2018  a goal it will reach with relative ease if Suzuki becomes a subsidiary.        
	In the first six months of 2009, Volkswagen sold 3.265 million vehicles and Suzuki sold 1.15 million. Their combined sales of 4.415 million units would be larger than top-ranked Toyotas 3.564 million.        
	Suzuki lost its equity ties to General Motors Co a year ago, having bought back the US auto makers 20 per cent stake in it, now worth about 257 billion yen ($2.9 billion).

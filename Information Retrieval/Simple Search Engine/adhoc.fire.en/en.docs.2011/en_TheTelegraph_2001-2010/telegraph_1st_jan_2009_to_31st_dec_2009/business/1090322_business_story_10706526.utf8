                                                                                                               Satyam board vets bids
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Kiran Karnik in Mumbai on Saturday. (PTI)                                  
	Mumbai, March 21: The board of Satyam Computer Services met here today to scrutinise the bids submitted by a clutch of entities, seeking to acquire a 51 per cent stake in the troubled company. Satyam is set to announce the short-listed candidates next week.        
	The company spokesperson stonewalled questions on todays board deliberations. However, sources said the shortlist had been drawn up in consultation with the two investment advisers  Goldman Sachs and Avendus.         
	The two investment bankers made a detailed presentation on the bidders and assessed their strengths in running the company.        
	The short-listed entities will now be granted access to the latest financial data on the scam-scarred company, estimations of the liabilities arising from class action lawsuits in the US and other relevant data. The bidders will have to sign a non-disclosure and non-solicitation agreement.        
	Satyam had earlier said it would announce the list of selected candidates by March 25.        
	More than 60 entities were reported to have evinced interest after Satyam kicked off the bidding process on March 9.         
	However, the number dropped sharply when the bidders were asked to submit detailed expressions of interest (EoIs) on Friday. An indication to this effect was available when Nasdaq-listed iGATE quit the race.        
	The board meeting, which lasted for nearly five hours, assessed all the bidders, including Larsen amp; Toubro, Tech Mahindra and the B.K. Modi-led Spice Group. Kiran Karnik, chairman of Satyams government-appointed board, declined to comment on the outcome of the meet.        
	Apart from Karnik, other members who attended the board meeting included Deepak Parekh, C. Achuthan, T. N. Manoharan and Tarun Das.        
	The board also discussed the current financial position of the company and other issues that included employee retention and operations.        
	On Friday, Deloitte and KPMG, the independent auditors, apprised the board members of the financial details that could be shared with the selected bidders who submitted the EoIs.        
	It is expected that Satyam could complete the selection process for a strategic investor in the next three to four weeks after a thorough evaluation of the potential bidders.         
	Some reckon that the winning bidder will be picked by the end of this month.

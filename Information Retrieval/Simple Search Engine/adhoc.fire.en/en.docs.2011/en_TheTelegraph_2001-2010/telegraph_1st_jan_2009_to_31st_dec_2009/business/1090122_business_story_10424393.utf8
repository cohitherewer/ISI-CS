The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | SEC keeps track of events
                                                                                                               SEC keeps track of events
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Jan. 21: The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) may start probing the Satyam accounting fraud and is in touch with the Indian authorities on the issue.         
	The SEC could investigate whether Satyam, which has Fortune 500 companies such as General Electric and Fujitsu among its clients, misled investors.        
	The SECs probe would have an impact on the class action law suits filed against Satyam in the US. Investors are seeking compensation as they had invested in Satyams American depository receipts (ADR) based on information furnished by the company. After Ramalinga Raju admitted to the fraud, the authenticity of such information is under cloud.        
	The ADRs are traded on the US bourses. Indian companies, that have issued ADRs, need to file their accounts restated under the US accounting norms. Hence, any accounting fraud by Satyam makes it accountable to investors in the US.

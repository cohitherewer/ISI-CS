The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Bourses on back foot
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Bourses on back foot
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Time game                                   
	Mumbai, Dec. 17: Angry stockbrokers today forced the two bourses  the Bombay Stock Exchange and the National Stock Exchange  to defer plans to extend trading hours, arguing that they were not ready to make such a momentous change at such a short notice.        
	The authorities of the two bourses, who seemed to be engaged in a game of one-up-manship with unilateral announcements earlier this week, finally came out with a joint statement that said the markets would start trading from 9 am from January 4.        
	On Wednesday evening, the two exchanges had announced they would start trading from 9 am from Friday. The decision drew howls of protests from a section of the market that felt the systems were not in place to allow for such a quick transition to the new hours. The other grouse was that the change would disrupt the lives of stockbrokers, especially those who live in the suburbs of Mumbai.        
	Based on the market feedback, it has been jointly decided by the BSE and the NSE that the revision of market open timing to 9 am shall be effective from Monday, January 4, 2010. In the interim, the current market open timing of 9.55am shall continue, the joint statement said. While the statement did not provide any details, it contradicted NSEs announcement on Wednesday that the decision had been taken after extensive talks with market participants.        
	Dinesh Thakkar, chairman and managing director of Angel Broking, said the large brokerages were prepared for extended trading hours but the small brokers were not. The whole market should be geared for the change, he said.        
	E.M.C. Palaniappan, president of the Association of National Exchanges of India, which represents members of both the NSE and BSE, said the ANMI would meet on December 20 to discuss the plan to extend trading hours.        
	A BSE spokesperson said the brokers of Calcutta Stock Exchange Ltd were not consulted on the matter. The BSE has a 5 per cent stake in CSE.

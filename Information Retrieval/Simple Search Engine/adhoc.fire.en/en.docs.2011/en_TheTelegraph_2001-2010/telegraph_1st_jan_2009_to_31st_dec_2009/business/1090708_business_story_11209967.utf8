The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Tiff over oil PSU losses
                                                                                                               Tiff over oil PSU losses
  - A day after the budget, industry is busy assessing the impact of Pranabs proposals        R. SURYAMURTHY                          Hard hit                                        
	New Delhi, July 7: The finance ministry has questioned the petroleum ministrys claims on the under-recovery of state-owned oil marketing companies from selling petrol and diesel below cost.        
	A large part of the losses are borne by the ministry through subsidies in the form of oil bonds and cash.        
	Ashok Chawla, the finance secretary, said the global crude price average was $50-52 per barrel, whereas the oil ministrys calculations were based on an average price of $70 per barrel.        
	He said, The average global crude oil prices in the first half of the year were around $50 to $52 a barrel. We do not understand how the petroleum ministry has calculated the fiscal average (for 2009-10) to be $70 a barrel, which would result in an under-recovery of Rs 30,000 crore.        
	However, Chawla did not rule out more support to the oil firms, if the global crude prices continued to rise.        
	Petrol and diesel prices were increased Rs 4 per litre and Rs 2 per litre, respectively, last week to partly cover the losses of the oil firms.         
	The government did not raise the prices of domestic LPG cylinder and kerosene though the public sector oil companies were losing Rs 92.96 per cylinder and Rs 15.26 a litre, respectively.         
	Even after the steep increase, the government said they would be losing Rs 2 a litre on petrol and Rs 1.62 a litre on diesel.        
	Previously, fuel prices were raised in June 2008, when global crude prices were around $140 a barrel, but were cut in December and again in January as crude prices tumbled.        
	Since touching $32 in January, crude has firmed up and is now at $64 per barrel.        
	Finance minister Pranab Mukherjee today said speculators and cartels might be working behind the scenes to jack up prices at a time when the US and Europe were still in the grips of the recession.        
	Oil secretary R.S. Pandey said with the restoration of tax breaks in natural gas production, the government would resume the eighth round of bidding for oil and gas blocks. The last date of application was likely to be extended.

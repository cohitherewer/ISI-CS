The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Oman wants to up Bina refinery stake
                                                                                                               Oman wants to up Bina refinery stake
                                  
	Dehradun, May 30 (PTI): After initial hesitation, Oman Oil Company is now keen on increasing its stake in Bharat Petroleum Corp Ltds Bina refinery project to 26 per cent and is ready to pay $250 million for the same.        
	Oman Oil has so far invested Rs 75 crore for a 2 per cent stake in Bharat Oman Refineries Ltd  the company that is building the six-million-tonnes-a-year refinery at Bina in Madhya Pradesh at a cost of Rs 10,400 crore.        
	We want to increase our equity (in the project) to 25-26 per cent. We are in discussions with BPCL, Oman oil minister Mohammed bin Hamad Al-Rumhy told reporters here.        
	The Bina refinery project was originally mooted in 1994 with BPCL and Oman Oil having a 26 per cent stake each and the rest going to public and a strategic investor.        
	However, Oman Oil did not make any equity contribution beyond Rs 75 crore and asked BPCL to convert it into equity which came to about 2 per cent in the revised project cost.        
	The reluctance of Oman Oil forced BPCL to approach the government to allow it to raise its stake in the project up to 50 per cent and the construction began in 2006.        
	The project is to be funded by Rs 4,000 crore equity and Rs 6,400 crore debt.         
	Since the project was nearing completion, a BPCL official said, the company had decided to offer a 26 per cent stake to Oman Oil again, but this time it would be at a premium.        
	The company has tied up the debt for the project that is expected to be commissioned in December this year. Besides its share, BPCL is advancing the equity share of its prospective partner as loan.        
	We are talking to BPCL and as far as we are concerned an agreement can be reached by next week, Al-Rumhy said.        
	The BPCL official said a 26 per cent stake was available to Oman Oil but it would have to pay a premium now.        
	A 26 per cent stake at par would entail an investment of Rs 1,040 crore while the Oman Oil offer of $250 million comes to Rs 1,250 crore. It was not immediately clear if the offer of $250 million was acceptable to BPCL.        
	The Bina refinery in Madhya Pradesh will have a crude supply arrangement consisting of a Single Point Mooring system, crude oil storage terminal at Vadinar in Gujarat and a crude pipeline from Vadinar to Bina.

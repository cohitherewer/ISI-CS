The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Srei rethink on Maytas project
                                                                                                               Srei rethink on Maytas project
          SOUNAK MITRA                          Kanoria: Review mode                                  
	Calcutta, Feb. 20: The Satyam fraud has prompted Srei Infrastructure Finance to take a relook at its business ties with Maytas Infrastructure. The Kanoria-promoted Srei was supposed to provide finance to Maytas for the Machilipatnam sea port project.        
	Everything depends on the governments decision. We are closely watching the developments of the Maytas case. We will only take a call after the government takes a final decision, Hemant Kanoria, Srei Infrastructure Finances chairman and managing director, told The Telegraph.        
	Maytas Infra along with Nagarjuna Construction Company, Srei Infrastructure and Sarat Chatterjee amp; Company had bagged a contract from the Andhra Pradesh government for constructing an all-weather deep-water port at Machilipatnam.        
	On Wednesday, the Andhra Pradesh government initiated a process to dump scam-scarred Maytas Infra from the Hyderabad metro rail project and the Machilipatnam port project.         
	We had expressed our intention of picking up equity in the Machilipatnam project about three years back. However, as we did not receive a detailed project report, we are yet to take a call on the project till date, Kanoria said. The company had made an initial investment of Rs 2-3 lakh in the proposed venture.        
	As an infrastructure company, Srei evaluates the viability of projects after a company approaches it.        
	We also assess whether it makes financial sense to invest in the company. Decisions are taken only after a detailed project report is ready and financial viability assured, he added.        
	The Company Law Board today adjourned the hearing on the takeover of the boards of Maytas Infra and Maytas Properties till February 26.

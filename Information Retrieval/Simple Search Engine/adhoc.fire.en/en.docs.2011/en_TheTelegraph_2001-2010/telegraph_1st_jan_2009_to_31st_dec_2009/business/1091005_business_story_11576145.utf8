The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Loan bonanza for festive shoppers
                                                                                                               Loan bonanza for festive shoppers

	New Delhi, Oct. 4: Consumer durable firms are spending more on advertising and betting on interest-free loans to push sales in the festive season.         
	Samsung has tied up with Bajaj Finance for a zero finance scheme that translates into nil initial payment, processing fee and interest, covering all products till the end of this month.         
	The offer will help consumers upgrade to premium products easily, said R. Zutshi, deputy managing director of Samsung India.        
	Under the scheme, the manufacturer bears the interest cost on the loan, while the processing fee is either passed on to the consumer or shared between the dealer and the manufacturer. So, while the consumer benefits by buying the product on easy instalments, the company earns revenues on bulk sales.        
	Tata group firm Voltas offers traditional finance schemes throughout the year under which partial payment is made at the time of purchase and the rest is financed according to market rates. It has now launched a zero per cent finance scheme on its mid and high-end air conditioners and water coolers.        
	Till early last year, financed consumer durables constituted 15-20 per cent of overall sales. This came down to 8-10 per cent after banks and finance companies drastically reduced lending during the end of last year.        
	The festive season accounts for almost 35-40 per cent of the annual sales of durables firms.         
	Kamal Nandi, vice-president (marketing), Godrej amp; Boyce, said, This festival season we are optimistic of a growth rate of 30 per cent over last year. There was a dip in sales last year because of a slump in the market.         
	Godrej amp; Boyce, which registered a 20-25 per cent growth in sales in the April-June quarter, expects to earn nearly Rs 600 crore between September and December. This will be Rs 140 crore more than the corresponding period last year.        
	Electronics and home appliances firms are increasing their advertising and marketing spends by 15-60 per cent this year. The market for consumer durables is estimated at around Rs 25,000 crore        
	LG Electronics India is eyeing Rs 2,800 crore this festive season  a sales growth of 35 per cent over the year-ago period. Amitabh Tiwari, business head (consumer electronics) of LG, said, Last year, consumer sentiment was bad. But it has improved substantially now. So we are spending Rs 110 crore on advertising and promotions, up from Rs 68 crore last year. We are also looking at investing more in television commercials.        
	LG has set a target to close this year with a turnover of Rs 11,500 crore, up from Rs 10,000 crore last year. Whirlpool India plans to increase its investment in advertising and marketing by 10-15 per cent from Rs 45 crore last year.         
	We are now a debt-free company and we are looking at improving our sales, quarter-on-quarter in this festive season. While last year was uncertain because of the global recession, markets are already improving now, said Shantanu Dasgupta, vice-president (corporate affairs and strategy), Whirlpool.         
	The firm is looking at earning Rs 500 crore between September and November, a 25-30 per cent growth over the year-ago period.

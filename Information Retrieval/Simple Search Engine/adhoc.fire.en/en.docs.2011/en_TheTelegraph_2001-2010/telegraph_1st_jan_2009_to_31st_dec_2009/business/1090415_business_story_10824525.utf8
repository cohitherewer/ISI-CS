          OUR BUREAU AMP; AGENCIES                          Hand in hand                                  
	Mumbai, April 14: GVK Biosciences and Chinese clinical research organisation Excel PharmaStudies have joined hands to do clinical trials.         
	GVK Bio and Excel will help each other in conducting clinical trials, statistical analysis and medical writing.        
	GVK will manage the India trials of Excel and vice-versa.        
	This is a first of a kind alliance between an Indian and a Chinese clinical research organisation. The GVK Bio-Excel alliance integrates trial management across India and China and provides sponsors with a single point of contact, GVK Bio president Manni Kantipudi said.        
	Clinical trials are done on humans to test the efficacy of a new drug. They are done in five phases (0-IV) with the sample size rising in each phase.         
	GSK and Excels arrangement is for phases II to IV of trials, which involve handling a huge mass of information.        
	Pharmaceutical companies which are developing a drug  called a sponsor in industry parlance  can use GSK and Excels partnership to do trials in both India and China.         
	Indias strength lies in phase II and phase III of a trial, while Chinas is in phases III and IV.        
	This is the first instance of pharmaceutical research firms from India and China joining hands.        
	Based in Hyderabad, GVK Biosciences has more than 1,500 employees spread across its research facilities in Hyderabad, Chennai, Mumbai and Gurgaon.        
	Excel is the leading clinical research organisation of China.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Oct. 8: The government plans to divest stake in four listed firms this fiscal to raise funds for expansion and social projects.         
	The four PSUs on the divestment list are National Thermal Power Corporation Ltd (NTPC), Rural Electrification Company Ltd (REC), Minerals and Metals Trading Corporation Ltd (MMTC) and NMDC Ltd. Around Rs 35,000 crore can be mopped up from the stake sales in these state-owned firms.        
	According to officials, the government is considering offloading a 10 per cent stake in MMTC, 8.38 per cent in NMDC, 5 per cent in NTPC and 4.5 per cent in REC.        
	The commerce ministry has recommended a 10 per cent divestment in MMTC  the largest importer of gold in the country  for an estimated Rs 17,000 crore, sources said.         
	MMTC shares fell Rs 135.45, down 0.38 per cent, to Rs 35,666.50 on the BSE today.        
	The government holds 99.33 per cent in MMTC, a global trader of minerals and metals, including gold and silver. The state-owned firm brought in 146 tonnes of the total gold import of 600 tonnes in 2008-09.        
	Sources said the government was also planning to sell 8.38 per cent in iron ore producer NMDC that could mop up at least Rs 10,000 crore. The scrip closed at Rs 344.85, down 1.19 per cent, on the BSE. The proposed divestment will reduce the Centres holding from 98.38 per cent to 90 per cent.        
	The cabinet was scheduled to discuss the stake sale of NTPC today, which would have set the ball rolling for divestment in other listed firms.        
	The meeting of the cabinet committee on economic affairs, however, could not be held as finance minister Pranab Mukherjee and home minister P. Chidambaram had prior engagements, officials said. The committee will now discuss the issue at its next meeting.        
	With the sale of a 5 per cent stake, the governments holding in NTPC will come down to 85 per cent. Going by the current valuation, the government may be able to raise over Rs 8,000 crore. The market capitalisation of NTPC is Rs 1,72,000 crore.        
	The NTPC stock closed on a positive note at Rs 211.90, up 1.39 per cent, on the bourses.        
	The countrys largest power generator, with an installed capacity of over 30,000MW, needs money to expand generation by the end of the Eleventh Plan period.        
	REC, which provides loan to state power utilities for investment in rural electrification schemes, can partially dilute the governments 81.8 per cent stake. The dilution will involve a 4.5 per cent follow-on issue of fresh equity along with a 10 per cent sale of government holding.         
	The government plans to raise Rs 10,000 crore in a year through stake sale in public sector companies. This is more than what the UPA government had mopped up during its previous tenure, when it had to face opposition from the Left parties.        
	The National Investment Fund (NIF) now has a cash reserve of just Rs 994 crore. However, if the allies allow the Congress-led coalition government to use the money raised from divestment to fund social projects, either directly or through the NIF, it will help the Centre balance its books better.

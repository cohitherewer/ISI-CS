          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                            
	Mumbai, Dec. 2: The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has relaxed its tough provisioning norms for banks that are due to kick in next year.        
	In late October, the RBI had said banks would have to have provisioning on their books to cover 70 per cent of their non-performing assets (or bad loans) by September 2010.        
	Several banks such as the State Bank of India are way below the 70 per cent coverage ratio, which had raised the prospect of a scramble to comply with the tough requirement.        
	Now, the RBI has relented somewhat by tweaking the formula. It has permitted banks to include technical write-offs while calculating their provisioning coverage ratio.        
	Technical or prudential write-off is the amount which have been written-off by the bank against outstanding non-performing loans.         
	The change  which was announced late on Tuesday  will ease some of the pressure on banks, sources said.         
	A loan is classified as an NPA if a customer fails to pay his dues for a period of 90 days.        
	In the case of such accounts, banks have to provide a specific portion, which till now ranged between 10 per cent and 100 per cent of the outstanding amount, depending on the age of the NPAs and the security available.        
	The provisioning coverage ratio (PCR) is the ratio of provisioning to gross NPAs and indicates the extent of funds a bank has kept aside to cover loan losses.        
	After its second quarter review of monetary policy on October 27, the RBI had directed banks to augment their provisioning cushions consisting of specific provisions against NPAs as well as floating provisions, and ensure that their total PCR, including floating provisions, was not less than 70 per cent.        
	Floating provisions are those extra provisions made by banks that are not linked to any specific account. This is done to create a buffer, should there be any defaults.        
	The RBIs move to hike the PCR to 70 per cent in the monetary policy was seen as affecting those banks who had lower provisioning ratios.         
	It was feared that banks such as the the SBI, ICICI Bank, Oriental Bank of Commerce and Dena Bank would be forced to make higher provisions for NPAs, thereby impacting their profitability.        
	Brokerages such as Nomura estimated that the SBI provision shortfall would be close to Rs 2,900 crore, while it would be around Rs 1,360 crore in the case of ICICI Bank.        
	Responding to the measure, banks had urged the RBI to not only include write-offs while calculating PCR but also extend the timeline to March 31, 2011.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | iGATE opts out of race for Satyam 
                                                                                                               iGATE opts out of race for Satyam 
  - L amp;T, Tech Mahindra and Spice submit EoIs        OUR BUREAU                          Backtrack                                        
	March 20: Larsen amp; Toubro (L amp;T), Spice Corp and Tech Mahindra today submitted expressions of interest (EoIs) in their quest to acquire a majority stake in fraud-hit Satyam Computer Services Ltd, but Nasdaq-listed iGATE dropped out of the race.        
	The deadline for submission of formal EoIs ended at 5pm. It wasnt immediately clear how many private equity firms and overseas entities had gone on to submit their formal EOIs after registering last week for the right to participate in the sale process.        
	Kohlberg Kravis amp; Roberts and Texas Pacific Group are some of the private equity firms that had reportedly jumped into the race. IBM was also keen to bid.         
	The entities that submitted their EoIs were also required to prove that they had a cash trove of at least Rs 1,500 crore to buttress their bids.        
	Sources at iGATE said the firm dropped out of the race as it did not get any clarity on the updated liabilities of the company. The firm said it had no option but to withdraw its EoI as Satyam had not provided the information. iGATE had insisted on the latest financial statements for the quarter ended December 31 and the months of January and February this year.        
	Satyams board of directors is expected to meet in Mumbai on Saturday and confer with its investment advisers  Goldman Sachs and Avendus  before short listing the bidders. The short-listed entities will then be given access to financial information on Satyam. The bidders will conduct a due diligence and submit their final bids.        
	The bidders want greater information on the size of Satyams liabilities, its current financial position, an estimation of the liabilities arising from the class action lawsuits filed against the company by shareholders in the US, and the attrition levels over the past few months. L amp;T had indicated that the submission of its final bid would hinge on the disclosures made by Satyam.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Centre weighs bond issue for banks
                                                                                                               Centre weighs bond issue for banks
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                               
	Mumbai, Jan. 4: The Centre may issue bonds to banks when it infuses them with Rs 20,000 crore of capital as promised on Friday in its second stimulus package.         
	Such a strategy was recently taken in the case of the State Bank of India. Though the boards of banks make the decision, the government being the majority shareholder has a say.        
	Bankers are, however, divided on whether the government will issue bonds or cash. The government will most likely look to increase the Tier I capital of these banks. One of the ways of doing this is through a rights issue to which it will subscribe, a senior official of a PSU bank said.         
	In the SBI rights issue, the government had invested a little less than Rs 10,000 crore.         
	Instead of subscribing to the issue through cash, it had issued special bonds to the countrys largest bank for maintaining its stake at around 59 per cent.         
	Sources said one of the main advantages of this method was that it would help those having a government stake of around 51 per cent.         
	Since the government cannot bring down its holding below 51 per cent, these banks find it difficult to raise money from the capital markets.         
	The Centre holds around 51 per cent in Dena Bank, Andhra Bank and the Oriental Bank of Commerce. Moreover, an expansion in a banks Tier I capital gives it room to raise funds through other instruments such as bonds.     
	The Rs 20,000-crore plan will be implemented over the next two years. Planning Commission deputy chairman Montek Singh Ahluwalia had said that additional capital would help in sustaining economic growth via increased credit.         
	It is expected that banks with capital adequacy ratios below 12 per cent will get the money to meet the Basel international banking norms.        
	Capital adequacy ratio is the ratio of capital that banks must have relative to their assets. The Reserve Bank of India stipulates a ratio of at least 9 per cent.         
	Uco Bank, Andhra Bank, Dena Bank, Vijaya Bank, the Central Bank of India and Allahabad Bank could be the beneficiaries of the recapitalisation plan.         
	Earlier, the government had released around Rs 20,000 crore to raise capital during 1995-96, 1996-97 and 1997-98.         
	During that period, the banks to benefit were Allahabad Bank, Canara Bank, the United Bank of India, Andhra Bank, the Central Bank of India, Uco Bank, Vijaya Bank, Indian Bank and Punjab and Sind Bank.         
	The decision to increase capital will improve sentiment, especially after the RBI had said last month that the non-performing assets of banks had gone up for the first time in six years in 2007-08. Bad loans of new generation private banks and foreign lenders are more noticeable.

          OUR BUREAU                          In fine fettle                                  
	New Delhi, Sept. 25: The six key infrastructure industries grew 7.1 per cent in August in a clear indication of a robust recovery in the economy.        
	The six industries  cement, coal, electricity, steel, crude oil and petroleum refinery products  grew 2.1 per cent in the same month last year.        
	Cement was at the top, expanding 17.6 per cent in August. Others to do well were coal (12.9 per cent) and electricity (9.8 per cent).         
	Petroleum refinery production expanded 3 per cent and finished steel, 3.1 per cent. However, crude oil remained in the negative zone with a 2.6 per cent decline.        
	Crisils chief economist D.K. Joshi said the infrastructure numbers indicated that overall industrial production would be very healthy.

	Excise mop-up jumps        
	Excise duty collection in August rose 22.7 per cent, further raising revival prospects. The government now hopes it will be able to meet the indirect tax targets for the year.        
	The industry is clearly showing signs of a revival. We are hopeful of meeting the target, said V. Sridhar, chairman of the Central Board of Excise and Customs. He was addressing a seminar organised by the Confederation of Indian Industry.         
	Sridhar said the growth in excise collections was led by sugar, petroleum products and cigarettes.         
	Excise mop-up from sugar rose 16 per cent, while from petroleum products it was about 4-5 per cent.

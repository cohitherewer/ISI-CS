The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | August 7 date for NHPC flotation
                                                                                                               August 7 date for NHPC flotation
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Garg: Raring to go                                  
	New Delhi, July 16: State- owned NHPC is set to come out with its initial public offering on August 7 to mop up around Rs 5,000 crore, kicking off the governments divestment programme for the fiscal.        
	If everything goes well, the IPO is likely in the first week of August, tentatively August 7, S.K. Garg, NHPC chairman and managing director, told reporters on the sidelines of an industry event.        
	Indias No. 1 hydel firm will issue fresh shares to the extent of 10 per cent of equity, and the government will offload 5 per cent of its stake.        
	Investors will be offered 168 crore shares having a face value of Rs 10 each, with the premium being decided through book-building.         
	Sources said a premium of at least Rs 20 per share would be charged. The company had deferred its IPO last year because of unfavourable market conditions.         
	Garg said the proceeds would be utilised to finance the companys expansion. NHPC plans to invest Rs 28,000 crore by 2012 to position itself as an over 10000MW utility. At present, its generation capacity is 5200 mw.         
	The public sector company accounts for 3.7 per cent of the countrys power generation capacity.        
	The budget has estimated divestment proceeds to be Rs 1,120 crore for 2009-10. However, finance ministry officials said a road map would be ready by mid-August to raise Rs 15,000 crore this fiscal if market conditions were favourable.         
	A senior petroleum ministry official said Oil India was likely to hit the market with its IPO on September 7. According to the tentative schedule drawn, the IPO may open for public subscription on September 7 and close on September 11, the official said.         
	Oil India will offer new shares to the tune of 11 per cent of equity, while the government will divest 10 per cent of its stake.        
	Finance secretary Ashok Chawla had said yesterday that the government would come out with a road map for divestment in three to four weeks. He had also said there would be no strategic sales, meaning a single investor would not get chunks of a government firm.

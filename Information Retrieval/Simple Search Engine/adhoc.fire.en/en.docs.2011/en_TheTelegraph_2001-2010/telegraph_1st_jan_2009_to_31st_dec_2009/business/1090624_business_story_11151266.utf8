	New Delhi, June 23: State-owned telecom player Bharat Sanchar Nigam Limited (BSNL) is planning to use part of its Rs 30,000 crore reserves for global acquisitions.         
	The company is also awaiting the approval from the government for a proposed public offering to fund domestic expansion and purchase 3G spectrum.        
	We are looking at various options, whether it is for new licences being issued or partnering with existing players in the overseas markets, Kuldeep Goyal, chairman and managing director of BSNL, said today.         
	He said BSNL had cash reserves of over Rs 30,000 crore and had received government approval to apply for overseas licences.         
	BSNL is looking at opportunities across the globe but is more interested in the African and the West Asian markets, especially South Africa.         
	The PSU has shortlisted eight consultants, including Ernst amp; Young, McKinsey, KPMG and PwC, to advise it on mergers and acquisitions, strategic partnerships and overseas forays.         
	On its initial public offering, Goyal said, We will have to await the decision of the government. We will start negotiating with the (employee) unions once we get the governments approval.        
	BSNL today entered into a three-year pact with Microsoft, under which it will offer business mail applications for Rs 420 per month.

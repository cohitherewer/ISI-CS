          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                             
	Mumbai, March 19: The rupee today gained 92 paise, its biggest rise in 2009. It closed at a three-week high of 50.39 against the dollar, helped by a weak US greenback and a firm domestic equity market.        
	In active trade at the inter-bank foreign exchange market, the rupee opened sharply higher at 51.05 per dollar from the previous close of 51.31.        
	There was no stopping the rupee. Exporters and banks were heavily selling dollars on fears of a further fall in its value, a dealer said.        
	Analysts said the unit hit an intra-day high of 50.30 and later settled at 50.39, a sharp rise of 1.79 per cent.         
	Yesterday, it was up 19 paise.         
	Urvi Gandhi, analyst at Mecklai Financial Services, said the rupee gained on account of the dollars weakness against most global currencies, including the euro. Gandhi said the rupee was likely to appreciate in the immediate term.        
	On Wednesday, the US Federal Reserve surprised the markets by announcing that it would buy government bonds of up to $300 billion.

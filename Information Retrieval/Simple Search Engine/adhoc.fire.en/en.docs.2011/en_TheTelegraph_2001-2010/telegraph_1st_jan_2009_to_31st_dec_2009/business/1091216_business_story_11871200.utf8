          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                            
	New Delhi, Dec. 15: Merchandise exports grew 18 per cent to $13.2 billion in November  a positive growth after 13 months  but the government said it was just a statistical blip.        
	There is no great shift in demand, it (growth) is because of the base effect there is no need to go hoopla over these numbers, commerce secretary Rahul Khullar told reporters. A year ago, exports had fallen almost 20 per cent to $11.6 billion. Between April and November, exports were actually down 22.3 per cent to $104.25 billion from a year ago.        
	Exporters were, however, more positive. The export growth in November is largely due to Christmas and New Year sales. During the remaining part of the fiscal, exports are likely to be in the positive zone, but will not be as impressive as the latest figure, A Sakthivel, president of the Federation of Indian Export Organisations, said.        
	Among the sectors to perform well were gems and jewellery, which grew over 40 per cent to $2.15 billion, readymade garments, 6 per cent to $727 million, and man-made fibre and petroleum products.        
	Sakthivel said the December figures were very crucial to determine whether the buoyancy would continue.         
	Commerce minister Anand Sharma said the government would soon decide on exports sops for labour intensive sectors such as engineering goods and textiles.        
	Currently, the government is undertaking a review of the performance of the sectors.        
	Khullar said exports for the full financial year could possibly touch $165-$170 billion, down from $185 billion last year. The government will formally release the figures for November on January 1.        
	Exports have snapped a lengthy losing streak that began in October 2008 following the collapse of Lehman Brothers. The decline was as much as 33 per cent both in March and April, though it had since been arrested. In October, exports had fallen 6.6 per cent.

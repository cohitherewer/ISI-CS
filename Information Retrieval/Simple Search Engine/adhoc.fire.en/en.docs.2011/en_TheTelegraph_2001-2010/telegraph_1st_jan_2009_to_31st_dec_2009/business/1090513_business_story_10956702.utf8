The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Stake sale on DLF agenda
                                                                                                               Stake sale on DLF agenda
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Mumbai, May 12: The promoters of DLF  the countrys foremost realty firm are planning to sell about 9.9 per cent equity to raise around Rs 3,800 crore.        
	Deutsche Bank and JP Morgan are the joint bookrunners to the issue and are pitching the shares at foreign investors.        
	Sources said the bookrunning operation would continue through the night with a strong possibility that the deal would be notified to the bourses tomorrow.        
	The total number of shares on offer is just over 168 million shares.         
	Sources said the shares would possibly be sold at Rs 225 apiece.        
	Officials from JP Morgan could not be reached to confirm the development.        
	The DLF stock closed today on the Bombay Stock Exchange at Rs 236.25.        
	In the year ended March 31, DLF reported a net profit of Rs 4,680.44 crore on net sales of Rs 10,044 crore.        
	The proceeds from the issue will be pumped into group company DLF Assets Ltd.        
	DLF Assets will use the money to redeem the compulsory convertible preference shares that were issued to US hedge fund DE Shaw.        
	DLF Assets also owes Rs 4,900 crore to DLF and the stake sale proceeds will be used to close this liability.        
	This will also prove beneficial to the DLF stock as analysts have been expressing concern over the DLF Assets liabilities.        
	DE Shaw had invested over $400 million in DLF Assets back in 2007 when the market was still booming.         
	DLF Assets was planning to establish special economic zones in Gurgaon, Chennai and Hyderabad but couldnt make much progress as a result of the economic downturn.         
	At one point, DLF had even considered an equity flotation to raise the cash and redeem the bonds that DE Shaw had bought. But this idea was abandoned as the market went through a roller coaster which wrecked the prospects for a stock flotation.

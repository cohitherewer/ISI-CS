                                                                                                               UBI awaits nod for capital recast
          A STAFF REPORTER                          S.C. Gupta                                   
	Calcutta, Feb. 28: The United Bank of India (UBI) expects the Centre to clear its proposal to restructure equity capital by March 31.        
	We believe the finance ministry will approve our capital restructuring proposal by the end of the current fiscal, UBI chairman and managing director S.C. Gupta said.         
	In the interim budget, the finance ministry had approved a Rs 250-crore recapitalisation support to the bank. This will help us raise the capital adequacy ratio of the bank to over 12 per cent from 11 per cent now, Gupta added.         
	In December, the bank had submitted a capital restructuring plan that proposed reduction in its paid-up equity capital to Rs 266 crore from the present level of Rs 1,532 crore. The bank has asked for transfer of Rs 1,156 crore of equity to general reserves and conversion of another Rs 110 crore to perpetual debt.

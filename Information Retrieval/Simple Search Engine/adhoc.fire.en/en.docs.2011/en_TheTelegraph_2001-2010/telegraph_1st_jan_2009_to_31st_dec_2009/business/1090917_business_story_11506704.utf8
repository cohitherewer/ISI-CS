	New Delhi, Sept. 16: Bharat Sanchar Nigam Ltd (BSNL) may not be able to make a foreign acquisition in a hurry because of a cash crunch.         
	The company is not opposed to overseas expansion. But it needs to save money for the impending third-generation (3G) auction and, hence, will have to steer clear of acquisitions right now, said an official.         
	BSNL has around Rs 35,000 crore of cash, which will not be sufficient to fund the purchase of 3G radiowaves, domestic expansion as well as a foreign acquisition, the official said.        
	The state-run firm will have to use part of its cash reserves  which had earlier been earmarked to launch its global footprint  to pay for 3G spectrum.         
	BSNL will have to match the highest bid after the auction is complete for private companies.        
	The firm will also have to pay a minimum of Rs 6,000 crore for Wi-Max, said analysts. Besides BSNL will have to factor in an increase in its wage bill of about Rs 2,000 crore for the current fiscal.        
	Earlier, the company had planned to raise cash through its proposed equity listing to fund overseas and domestic expansion plans and to buy 3G spectrum .        
	However, falling profits and adverse market conditions have put the flotation plan on the backburner. Opposition from the unions backed by the Left has also put a spoke in BSNLs wheel.        
	The company also wants to hold on to its cash to maintain interest earnings, and pay for an ongoing restructuring programme critical for long-term profitability, added the official.         
	BSNL has hired Boston Consulting Group to implement a restructuring programme that would improve operational efficiency. BSNLs revenues have been dipping over the past few years owing to high competition and low margins.         
	Lanka foray        
	BSNL has placed a bid for Luxembourg-based Millicoms Sri Lanka operations. Since the deal will not be completed before the second quarter of 2010, well after the completion of 3G auction, it is a possibility, said the official.        
	BSNL had recently been approached to buy a controlling 46 per cent stake in Kuwaits Zain Telecom as part of a consortium of investors led by the Vavasi Group for Rs 66,719 crore. However, the firm said it was not very enthusiastic about this offer at present. The company had also expressed interest to bid for licences in Tunisia and Oman.

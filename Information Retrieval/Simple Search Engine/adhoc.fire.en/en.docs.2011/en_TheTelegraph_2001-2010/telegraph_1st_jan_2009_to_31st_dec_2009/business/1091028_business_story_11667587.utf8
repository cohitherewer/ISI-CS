	New Delhi, Oct. 27: Power plants and refineries will get the bulk of Reliance Industries gas from the Krishna-Godavari basin beyond the previously allotted 40 million metric standard cubic metres per day (mmscmd).        
	At its meeting today, the empowered group of ministers (eGoM) also made some allotments for Reliances petrochemical plants and refineries.        
	The eGoM today fixed buyers for 50 mmscmd of gas  20 units on a firm basis and another 30 on a temporary basis till Reliance is confident of sustaining production of 90mmscmd of gas.        
	Oil secretary R.S. Pandey said power plants would get 13 mmscmd of the initial 20 mmscmd of gas.         
	Refineries and chemical plants, including units of Reliance Industries, will get 6.9 mmscmd, and the remaining will go to steel and fertiliser producers.        
	In the allocation on a temporary basis, power units will get 12mmscmd, refineries 6 units, city gas projects 2 units and captive power plants 10 units.         
	Reliance will have to conclude all agreements for gas purchase by December 1.        
	Pandey said the eGoM did not discuss marketing margins for the gas.         
	Sibal term        
	Oil minister Murli Deora said there was no decision yet on extending the term of the director-general of hydrocarbons V.K. Sibal.        
	He said the vigilance panel report on Sibal was expected in 2-3 days.

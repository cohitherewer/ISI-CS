	New Delhi, Dec. 8: Car sales soared 36.7 per cent in November, driven by a buoyant economy and rising demand during the festive and marriage season.        
	According to the Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers (Siam), sales rose to 1,13,687 units in November  the eighth consecutive month of growth  compared with 83,121 units in the same month last year.         
	Car sales grew 34 per cent in October.         
	Higher interest rates and the reluctance of banks to lend in a slowing economy had crimped demand last year. However, a series of stimulus measures, including tax concessions and rate cuts by banks, and launches have encouraged buying. Siam senior director Sugato Sen said the launch of models from January would boost the industry.        
	Siam is likely to revise its forecast for this fiscal following robust sales in the past few months.        
	Motorcycle sales were up 42.4 per cent to 6,14,274 units in November against 4,31,171 units a year ago. Sales of commercial vehicles almost doubled to 40,874 units from 20,631 units.        
	Sales of Maruti Suzuki India increased 56.7 per cent to 67,786 units, while Hyundai Motor India registered a 92.8 per cent growth at 28,161 units. Tata Motors sales went up 47.6 per cent to 18,480 units.        
	In motorcycles, Hero Hondas sales grew 33.6 per cent to 3,57,293 units, while that of rival Bajaj Auto rose 97.82 per cent to 1,62,773 units.        
	Siam said auto sales in November were impacted by the paucity of components, particularly tyres.

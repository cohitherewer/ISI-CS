The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | ONGC cash prop for Cairn crude
                                                                                                               ONGC cash prop for Cairn crude
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Sharma: Way ahead                                  
	New Delhi, June 6: The board of state-owned ONGC Ltd today decided to invest $1.22 billion in the Rajasthan oilfields operated by Cairn India.        
	This investment is $350 million more than what ONGC originally planned to pump into the oilfields, which are expected to begin commercial production later this month.        
	The board has approved the revised investment plan in Rajasthan field on the assurance from the government that it will be compensated for the payment of all statuary levies on the Rajasthan crude, R.S. Sharma, chairman and managing director of ONGC, told The Telegraph.        
	Company sources said the PSU had informed the petroleum ministry that it might not be able to go ahead with the revised investment plan if the firm was not compensated for the payments made by it on statuary levies.         
	They also cited the recommendations of a group of ministers and the committee of secretaries in this regard.        
	During its last meeting, the board of ONGC had deferred a decision on the issue after some of the independent directors raised questions over the steep increase in the cost and negative returns on investment.         
	ONGC had been delaying the clearance for the revised budget as it felt the investment could fetch negative returns if it was made to bear the entire burden of royalty and cess for the oil produced from the block.        
	Cairn had earlier revised the total cost for developing three oilfields in the Rajasthan block to $3.60 billion. The cost went up steeply because of a sharp hike in construction, drilling and manpower bills. Also the initial cost did not include the 600-km pipeline, to be built at a cost of $940 million, to move crude to the Gujarat coast.         
	When work started in 2005, Cairn India had estimated that the cost of developing the block would be $1.5 billion. The block has three main oilfields  Mangala, Bhagyam and Aishwariya.        
	According to the revised cost structure, ONGCs total exposure in the project will now rise from $874.2 million to $1.22 billion.        
	ONGC holds a 30 per cent stake in the oilfields. Under the deal, the PSU major is only entitled to an equivalent share of the crude recovered from the area though it has to pay the entire royalty, including that of Cairn, which gets 70 per cent share of the crude produced from the field.        
	With crude prices at $60 a barrel, sources said, ONGC would be left with $6.5 per barrel after payment of royalty, cess and profit petroleum to the government. On the other hand, Cairn, the operator of the oilfields, will get $42.5 per barrel since it does not have to pay royalty.        
	Officials said the potential net loss, estimated over the life of the block of 18-20 years, could be as high as Rs 14,000 crore for ONGC.        
	The crude from Cairns field will cut Indias oil import bill by as much as 7 per cent at a peak production of 175,000 barrels a day. Cairn intends to kick off with an output of 30,000 barrels a day in the June-August period and will increase it to 80,000 barrels by the end of the year. The production is expected to reach its peak in 2011.        
	The Rajasthan crude is heavy and waxy and it will only be able to produce small volumes of kerosene and diesel and not LPG.        
	The government has found buyers in Indian Oil, Hindustan Petroleum and Mangalore Refinery for only 2.4 million tonnes of the 8.75 million tonnes peak output planned by Cairn. It will produce 1.5 million tonnes in 2009-10 but the three firms are willing to take no more than 0.7 million tonnes and the prices have not yet been finalised.

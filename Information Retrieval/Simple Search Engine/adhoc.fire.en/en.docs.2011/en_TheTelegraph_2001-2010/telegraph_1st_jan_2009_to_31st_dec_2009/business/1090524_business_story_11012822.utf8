	New Delhi, May 23: Fiat Automobile India Limited, a 50:50 joint venture between Fiat S.p.A and Tata Motors, plans to launch its hatchback Grande Punto in the second half of this year.        
	Based on the Lineas platform, the Grande Punto is set to be rolled out as early as June or July. The car is Fiats second offering in the compact segment after the Palio.        
	Grande Punto will be available in both petrol and diesel versions and is expected to be priced between Rs 4.5 lakh and Rs 6.75 lakh.         
	It will compete with the Skoda Fabia, Marutis Swift, Ford Fusion, Hyundai i20, and Hondas Jazz, which is slated for launch in June.        
	Analysts said the Fiat hatchback was a huge success in Europe.         
	Around 75 per cent of the components for the Grande Punto in India will be sourced locally. Company sources said the localisation content will be raised.        
	The five-door compact car will be rolled out from the companys Ranjangaon facility near Pune.         
	Fiat has already started training sessions for dealers. There are plans to ramp up the dealer outlets from 70 to 100 by the middle of 2009. Also in the pipeline are Fiat Bravo and Cinquecento (Fiat 500) for the niche segment.         
	The company has achieved a very high level of localisation for the Linea, helping it to keep costs of spares under control and allowing better after sales service.         
	According to company sources, the Linea is expected to clock a volume of 24,000 units in the first year.         
	The rest of the volume will comprise a mixture of Grande Punto, Palio, Bravo and Fiat 500.        
	Other car companies such as Toyota, Volkswagen, Honda Siel and Ford have also firmed up plans to roll out hatchbacks and sedans in India.

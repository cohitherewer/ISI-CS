The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Manu mom stakes claim to SWC assets 
                                                                                                               Manu mom stakes claim to SWC assets 
                              Battle brews                            
	New Delhi, Aug. 4 (PTI): Ranibai Rajaram Chhabria, the mother of late Manohar (Manu) Rajaram Chhabria, has challenged the merger of Shaw Wallace with UB Group in the Supreme Court, saying she was entitled to a fifth of her deceased sons estate.        
	Ranibai has contended that Calcutta High Courts approval to the amalgamation of Shaw Wallace with Vijay Mallya-run United Spirits will dilute her right to inherit one-fifth of the estate.        
	She claimed that Manu Chhabria had died intestate (without a will) in April 2002, and according to the Hindu law, she was entitled to a share of his property.        
	However, the wife and three daughters of the deceased had taken control of the group citing a will left behind by him and have since then sold off certain businesses, including the liquor arm.        
	Accusing her sons family of denuding the valuable assets of the company, Ranibai said she had learnt from newspaper reports in 2004 that her daughter-in-law Vidya Chhabria tried to dispose of the controlling shareholding of the Chhabria family in Shaw Wallace.        
	Seeking to restrain United Spirits from taking any steps to delete the name of Shaw Wallace from the registrar of companies, Ranibai said the high court was wrong in refusing to look into the allegation of siphoning off assets before effecting the sale of shares, thus adversely affecting the valuation of Shaw Wallace.        
	She said the high court should have taken into consideration a Dubai court decision, which held that she as the mother of the deceased was entitled to her share of the estate.        
	The high court should have directed an investigation into the affairs of Shaw Wallace before sanctioning the amalgamation scheme, the petition said.        
	A bench headed by Justice S.H. Kapadia last week deferred the hearing on the matter by three weeks.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                            
	Calcutta, Jan. 21: City-based Uco Bank today reported a 107.35 per cent growth in net profit at Rs 171.64 crore for the quarter ended December 31, 2008 compared with Rs 82.78 crore during the same quarter a year ago.         
	For the nine months from April to December, the public sector banks net profit grew to Rs 455 crore from Rs 326 crore in the previous year, an increase of 39.57 per cent.        
	However, the nine months net profit, as a percentage of the total business of Rs 1,47,764 crore as on December 31, 2008, was only 0.31 per cent.         
	We are targeting a total business of Rs 1,60,000 crore by the end of the current financial year, said S. K. Goel, chairman and managing director of Uco Bank.         
	In the third quarter of the current financial year, we disbursed around Rs 2,500 crore by way of advances. The growth in advances is expected to pick up in the fourth quarter, he added.         
	The bank expects a higher profitability in the fourth quarter on the back of a higher growth in advances.        
	Uco Banks higher profitability in the third quarter is attributed to non-interest income, including cash recovery from non-performing assets.        
	The bank reported a growth of 19.05 per cent in net interest income at Rs 450 crore during the quarter, while its operating profits surged 103.03 per cent to Rs 402 crore.

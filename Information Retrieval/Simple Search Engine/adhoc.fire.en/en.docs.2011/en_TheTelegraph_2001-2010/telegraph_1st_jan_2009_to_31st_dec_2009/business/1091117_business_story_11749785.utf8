          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Mumbai, Nov. 16: Oman Oil Company will raise its stake in Bharat Oman Refinery Ltd, a joint venture with Bharat Petroleum Corporation Ltd (BPCL), to 26 per cent from 2 per cent.        
	Oman Oil will acquire the additional stake for Rs 1,220 crore, increasing its total investment in the venture to Rs 1,295 crore.         
	Bharat Oman is setting up a 6-million-tonne refinery at Bina in Madhya Pradesh, and the project will be commissioned by the second quarter of next year.         
	An agreement for the additional stake was signed in Oman on Sunday among Oman Oil, BPCL and Bharat Oman. A senior BPCL official told The Telegraph that after Oman Oils stake hike to 26 per cent, BPCL would hold 49 per cent in the refinery venture. The remaining stake will be offloaded either through an initial public offering or via a private placement.         
	This will be decided at a later stage, the official said. Bharat Oman had earlier considered an IPO to raise around Rs 1,000 crore. The plan was dropped because of poor market conditions.        
	The estimated cost of the project is Rs 11,397 crore ($2.4 billion) and 96 per cent of the work have been completed, BPCL said in a statement. Under the project, crude oil will be transported from the western coast in Vadinar, Gujarat, through a 935km pipeline to Bina.         
	According to BPCL, the refining facility will provide petroleum products to customers in central and northern India.

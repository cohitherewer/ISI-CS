                                                                                                               Satyam buyer to make open offer
          OUR BUREAU                              
	March 5: The government today said the prospective buyer of Satyam Computer would have to make an open offer of 20 per cent.         
	Whether it (stake to be offered in Satyam) is 31 per cent or 26 per cent, anybody coming in would have to make an open offer of 20 per cent in the market. So, that is not an issue, Gupta said.        
	The Securities and Exchange Board of India had earlier amended the takeover code that allows companies whose boards have been superseded by the government to seek exemption from regulations such as the mandatory open offer and 26-week average price.         
	The open offer allows existing shareholders to exit the company by selling their stake to the acquirer at a pre-determined price.         
	In Hyderabad, Ramalinga Rajus brother and general manager of SRSR Holdings, B. Suryanarayana Raju, has been granted anticipatory bail.

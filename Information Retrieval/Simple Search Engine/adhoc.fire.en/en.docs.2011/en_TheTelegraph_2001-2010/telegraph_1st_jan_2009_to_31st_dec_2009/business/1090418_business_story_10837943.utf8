          OUR CORRESPONDENT                          REAP DIVIDENDS                                  
	New Delhi, April 17: Unitech Ltd, the countrys second largest real estate developer, today said it had sold the 199-room Marriott Courtyard hotel in Gurgaon for Rs 231 crore.        
	Unitech, which has raised $325 million (about Rs 1,625 crore) to retire part of its Rs 8,400-crore debt, plans to sell four hotel sites in Calcutta, Gurgaon and Noida in six months. In a presentation to investors, Unitech said it sold the Courtyard to a high net worth individual in Delhi.        
	As part of its strategy to deal with the slowdown in realty, Unitech is cashing in on its non-core assets by deleveraging through sale of assets like hotels, offices and infusion of private equity at the individual project level.         
	Unitech has signed MoUs for the sale of school plots in Gurgaon and a realty project in Kochi.         
	Of the companys total debt, it has to repay Rs 2,500 crore in this fiscal year. The developer is expected to pay part of the debt on April 19.        
	The company also expects to close a deal to sell its Saket office complex in New Delhi spread over 2.2 lakh sq ft in the current quarter.        
	The office property is expected to be sold during the September quarter, while the four hotel sites will be sold in around six months. Unitechs sales have dipped to an all-time low because of the slowdown in the property market.        
	Real estate prices have fallen by almost a half from their 2007 peak as high interest rates, tight credit conditions and an uncertain economic environment kept buyers away from the market.        
	Unitech said it would launch 40 projects in the next 12 months across all major cities, with a focus on low-cost housing. In the sale of non-core assets, Unitech is preferring sales over leasing because it wants to increase cash at its disposal and pay back debts. This should result in a comfortable liquidity position in due course of time, Unitech said.        
	Meanwhile, foreign fund house CLSA (Mauritius) has picked up a 1.05 per cent stake in Unitech for Rs 88.28 crore through an open market transaction.

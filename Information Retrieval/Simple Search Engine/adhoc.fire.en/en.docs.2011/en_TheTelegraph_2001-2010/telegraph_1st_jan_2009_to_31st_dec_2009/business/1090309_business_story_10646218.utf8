The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Borrowing costs on the rise 
                                                                                                               Borrowing costs on the rise 
          JAYANTA ROY CHOWDHURY AMP; R.SURYAMURTHY                           Home truths                                  
	New Delhi, March 8: The steady dip in inflation has put industry and retail borrowers at a disadvantage.         
	They now find that their borrowing cost is steadily creeping up with every decline in the rate of inflation.         
	With headline inflation now near 3 per cent, real interest rates are hovering around 9-9.5 per cent for blue chip borrowers. Real interest rate is nominal lending rate minus inflation and gives a fair measure of the borrowing cost.         
	A year back, when prime lending rates were at least 100 basis points higher and inflation 7 per cent, real lending rates were 6.5-7.5 per cent.         
	The current rates have made Indian industry and exporters less competitive vis--vis their Asian rivals.         
	In Singapore, the rate is 5.6 per cent, the fifth lowest in Asia. Japans the lowest at 2.5 per cent, followed by South Korea (3.9 per cent), Malaysia (4.4) and Thailand (5.1), according to a survey.         
	Higher real rates also justify the decision of Indian consumers to stay away from buying cars and homes despite a fall in nominal rates.         
	Car loans currently vary between 11 per cent and 13 per cent and home loans, 9-12.5 per cent. However, real interest rates on car loans are 8-10 per cent against 5-7 per cent a year ago.         
	For home loans, they are at 6-9.5 per cent against 4-6.5 per cent a year ago.         
	Analysts said that faced with higher real rates, the Reserve Bank of India might put pressure on banks to cut nominal rates more drastically. The central bank may also go in for more rate cuts.         
	If banks do not cut (nominal) rates to bring down the real cost of financing we may face a situation where the demand for retail loans may actually start coming down, said Amit Banerjee, head of research with a leading state-run bank. When you have deposits and no takers for loans, banks end up being the losers. So logic dictates that in such cases rates are usually cut.         
	Last week, the RBI had reduced the repo rate  or the interest rate at which banks borrow from it  to 5 per cent, a reduction of 400 basis points since July.         
	However, bankers are reluctant to follow suit. The government wants to tackle the situation head-on, though it realises that its ability to influence banks is limited, following the announcement of the Lok Sabha polls.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Maytas hearing today
                                                                                                               Maytas hearing today
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Feb. 23: The company law board will hear a government petition on dissolving the board of Maytas Properties tomorrow.         
	For Maytas Infra, the hearing has been postponed to Thursday.        
	Earlier, the CLB had fixed the hearings of both the Maytas firms  promoted by the sons of Satyam founder B. Ramalinga Raju  for Tuesday.         
	In its petition to the CLB, the government had alleged that Maytas Infra diverted public money to Raju group companies.        
	Substantial funds (raised through IPO by Maytas Infra) received in the companys books of accounts have been diverted to group companies, associate concerns and subsidiaries. Most of the investments made are in the nature of interest-free loans and advances against the share application money, said the ministry of corporate affairs in its petition.        
	The government also said the corporate veil of the company should be lifted to see who were the persons in control. It will throw light on the present state of mismanagement, gross negligence and persistent financial irregularities into the running affairs of the company.        
	Last week, the ministry of corporate affairs had moved the CLB to remove the boards and have government nominees.        
	Experts said it might be difficult for the government to replace the Maytas boards. Akil Hirani of Majmudar amp; Co said the government needed to have a good case before the CLB. This case is different from Satyam where Ramalinga Raju had confessed to a fraud.         
	The Maytas management has already filed a caveat before the CLB and may move the Supreme Court as well, Hirani said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Dell to buy Perot Systems
                                                                                                               Dell to buy Perot Systems
          DAVID JOLLY AMP; ASHLEE VANCE                          Growth story                                  
	New York, Sept.21: Dell today said it would acquire information technology provider Perot Systems for $3.9 billion as it sought to expand beyond its core personal computer business.        
	Michael Dell, the companys founder and chief executive, has spent much of the recession talking about directing his companys cash stockpile towards acquisitions, particularly in the services arena. By agreeing to buy Perot Systems, for $30 a share in cash, Dell has made just such a purchase. But even with the acquisition, Dells services arm would remain far smaller than those of rivals, Hewlett-Packard and IBM.        
	Perot Systems, based in Plano, Texas, handles a wide range of technology services, including data centre management, software and consulting.        
	Perot Systems is a premium asset with great people that enhances our opportunities for immediate and long-term growth, Dell said. There will be efficiencies from combining the firms, but the acquisition makes such great sense because of the obvious ways our businesses complement each other.        
	Dell and Perot Systems  which was founded in 1988 by H. Ross Perot  said the terms of the deal had been approved by the boards of both firms. Perot Systems, which had garnered $2.8 billion revenue last year, will become Dells services unit and be led by Peter Altabef, the Perot Systems CEO. Ross Perot Jr., the chairman, is expected to join the Dell board.        
	Todays announcement is the next step in formalising a relationship that has flourished for some time, Ross Perot Jr. said. When my father founded Perot Systems, he envisioned a global IT leader. The new, larger Dell builds on that promise and its own successes by taking Perot Systems expertise to more customers than ever.        
	The combined heft of Perot Systems and Dells own services organisation should result in about $8 billion of services revenue annually, according to Dells statement. Services deals tend to have far higher margins than selling PCs and computer servers.

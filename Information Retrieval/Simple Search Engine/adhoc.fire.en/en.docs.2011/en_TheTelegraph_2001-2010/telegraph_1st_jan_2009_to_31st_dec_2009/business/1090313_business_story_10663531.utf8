The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | January jitters for industry
                                                                                                               January jitters for industry
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                            
	New Delhi, March 12: Industrial output fell 0.5 per cent in January  the second month in a row. This is the first time in 16 years that there has been a back-to-back decline in industrial output.         
	The government is looking to close the year with GDP growth of 7.1 per cent, and this forecast was predicated on the fact that the last quarter would show sharp growth.         
	In December, GDP growth stuttered at 5.3 per cent, and the economy needs to grow at 7.5 per cent in the last quarter to be able to keep its tryst with the 7.1 per cent overall growth target for the year. If industry slips  as it has in January  the growth target becomes harder to achieve. Meanwhile, as expected, inflation tumbled to 2.46 per cent.        
	In January, manufacturing production fell 0.8 per cent, while mining was down 0.4 per cent. However, capital and consumer goods offered scope for cheer.        
	While capital goods grew 15.4 per cent against 2.6 per cent a year ago, consumer goods expanded 2.5 per cent against a decline of 0.5 per cent in January 2008. Electricity generation during the period was up 1.8 per cent.        
	Analysts and industry chambers said the good show in some sectors was the result of the stimulants of the government and the RBI.        
	Inflation is at its lowest in over six years as prices of food items such as pulses, dairy products and edible oil softened further in the last week of February.        
	The prices of manufactured items, including iron and steel, textiles, chemicals and batteries, also declined during the week ended February 28.        
	In the previous week, inflation was at 3.03 per cent.        
	Falling wages        
	A report by the labour ministry says the average income of workers in labour-intensive industries has fallen 3.45 per cent a month in October-December.         
	This (fall in earnings) is consistent with the slowdown in the global economy, said D.K. Joshi, economist at Crisil.

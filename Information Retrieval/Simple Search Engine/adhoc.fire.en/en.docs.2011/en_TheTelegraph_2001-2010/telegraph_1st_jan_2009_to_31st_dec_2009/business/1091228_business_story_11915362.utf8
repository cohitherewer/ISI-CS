          A STAFF REPORTER                          Old is gold                                  
	Calcutta, Dec. 27: Multibrand used car company Mahindra First Choice Wheels Ltd plans to spend about Rs 100 crore over the next three years.        
	The estimated expenditure will be used in ramping up the number of outlets to 300 from 103 in the next three years and as capital expenditure, chief executive officer Subhabrata Saha said.        
	The company is targeting tier-I and tier-11 cities to fuel growth.         
	We will be entering the rural areas once we have our presence in major towns across the country, he said.        
	The company, which enjoys an 8 per cent share in the organised used car market, is targeting a turnover of Rs 500 crore by this fiscal.         
	In India, the used car market is estimated at 1.5-1.7 million units per annum, and the profit margin is around 8 per cent. About 10 per cent of this market is in the organised segment.         
	We are growing at 60 per cent against the industry rate of 20 per cent. Last year, we sold around 10,000 cars and we expect to end this year with 18,000. With expansion plans in place, we expect to sell 1 lakh cars by 2014, he said.        
	The company also plans to tie up with banks and financial institutions to make easy loans available to customers.        
	We have tie-ups with all the major banks apart from our own Mahindra Finance Ltd. We have a special arrangement with Syndicate Bank, which is offering car loan at 9 per cent. This is almost half of what is being offered in the unorganised used car market, he said.

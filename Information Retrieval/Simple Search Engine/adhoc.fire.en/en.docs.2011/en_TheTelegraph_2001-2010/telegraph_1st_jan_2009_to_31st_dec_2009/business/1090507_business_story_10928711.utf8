The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Post-poll props take shape
                                                                                                               Post-poll props take shape
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Singh: Future plans                                  
	New Delhi, May 6: Prime Minister Manmohan Singh today held a meeting with plan panel members who had hammered out a post-poll stimulus plan. While the details of the plan are under wraps, it may include increased spending in infrastructure projects and sector-specific packages.        
	Singh is keen on a 100-day revival programme for the economy. Officials said they were exploring the possibility of quick gestation infrastructure projects, where the money would be spent within this calendar year, deeper tax cuts to boost demand and expansion of the job guarantee scheme to urban areas.         
	However one problem is that we have no way of monitoring the impact of the previous stimulus packages, the officials said. A new quick index to measure the impact of the previous stimulus packages, which had included interest rate cuts, along with excise and service tax reductions, is being worked out.         
	Without inputs on how these packages have benefited industry or consumers, its no use throwing more money the same way, they said.         
	The Congress-led government has proposed a job guarantee scheme for urban areas on the lines of the rural plan. Though critics have derided the rural job guarantee scheme, the Congress feels it has given the party good political dividends in the elections. The urban job scheme and a plan to promote hubs for tiny industries could be part of the new stimulus package and are an answer to the lakhs of jobs lost in export industries because of a global recession.        
	Politically, the new jobs scheme and the tiny industries cluster development could pay huge dividends as it would directly impact lakhs of families.        
	Problems arose for the economy when the West plunged into a recession, hurting Indias export sector, which saw 5 lakh job losses over October-December.        
	Though exports make up only 20 per cent of the GDP, the feeling of gloom engulfed the rest of the economy, and consumer sentiment took a hit.        
	The officials said fiscal stimulus would be the main weapon to fight the slowdown as there was limited scope for cut in the RBIs key policy rates. The problem is the fiscal deficit, which is projected at 6 per cent of GDP in this fiscal.         
	Multilateral agency International Monetary Fund yesterday said that the Indian economy was expected to rebound near the end of the current calendar year. For India, we expect growth to slow markedly in 2009 before starting to rebound towards the year-end, the IMF said in its latest report, Regional Economic Outlook: Asia and Pacific.

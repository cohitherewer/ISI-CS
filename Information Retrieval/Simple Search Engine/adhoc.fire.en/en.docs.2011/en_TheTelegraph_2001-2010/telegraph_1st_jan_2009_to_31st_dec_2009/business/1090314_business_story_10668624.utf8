                                                                                                               Telecom tussle over 3G-type service
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                          TECH TIFF                                  
	New Delhi, March 13: GSM mobile operators have accused their CDMA rivals of providing 3G-equivalent services under the garb of wireless data cards.        
	In the line of fire is the EVDO (evolution data optimised) technology, which allows the CDMA players to provide services such as real-time transactions, video streaming, and fast Internet browsing using 2G spectrum. These services are the domain of 3G, for which the government is yet to issue a licence.        
	These (EVDO) services are being marketed as wireless broadband, high-speed Internet access services, but that does not change the fact that what is being made available to the customer is 3G EVDO services, according to T. V. Ramachandran, director of the Cellular Operators Association of India (COAI), which represents GSM operators.         
	Speeds of 2.4 mbps, 3.1 mbps are simply not possible in CDMA, Ramachandran stated in a letter to telecom secretary Siddhartha Behura.        
	Reliance Communications has recently launched a wireless Internet service that has a downlink speed of up to 3.1Mbps and an uplink speed of up to 1.8 Mbps. It is suited for video streaming and Internet browsing.        
	The COAI has requested the department of telecom to immediately stop these services and take action against errant operators.

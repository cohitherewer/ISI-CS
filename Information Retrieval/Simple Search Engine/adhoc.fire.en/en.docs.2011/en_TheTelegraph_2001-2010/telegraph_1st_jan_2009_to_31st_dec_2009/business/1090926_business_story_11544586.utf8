The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Fresh jolt to Sterlites Asarco bid 
                                                                                                               Fresh jolt to Sterlites Asarco bid 
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                            
	Mumbai, Sept. 25: A US bankruptcy court has spurned Sterlites sweetened bid for Asarco LLC  the second time that the Anil Agarwal-owned company has suffered a legal setback in its effort to wrest control of the US copper miner.        
	The court has once again recommended to Asarcos board that it should accept Grupo Mexicos competing offer.        
	On September 11, Sterlite had revised its open offer price for Asarco to $2.56 billion from $2.13 billion, which was higher than Grupo Mexicos offer of $2.48 billion. The Anil Agarwal companys revised offer was also very close to its original offer of $2.6 billion it made in 2008, which it later tried to renegotiate after the global economic downturn.        
	Last month, the bankruptcy court had recommended Grupo Mexicos bid on the ground that the plan was more likely to pay back Asarcos creditors in full.        
	Initially, Sterlite only wanted to acquire the assets of Asarco and wasnt keen to pick up its liability.         
	After the setback in August, it said that it would match Grupo Mexicos offer to release the US copper miner from its potential $8-billion legal liability arising from the transfer of Asarcos stake in Peruvian miner Southern Copper Corp.        
	A US district court referred the issue once again to the bankruptcy court to reconsider Sterlites revised offer.        
	Indicating that Sterlite was late in making the revised offer, the US bankruptcy court judge Richard Schmidt said the countrys bankruptcy code did not provide an unlimited right to modify a plan of reorganisation after it had been rejected in favour of a superior plan.        
	Judge Schmidt further concluded that if the parents plan (Grupo Mexicos bid) is closed it will culminate (in) perhaps the most successful major bankruptcy reorganisation in history.        
	Reacting to the judgment, Grupo Mexico said that it considered it a complete victory for the parent, Asarco and its creditors.        
	Sterlite Industries had announced its intention in May last year to acquire all the operating assets of Asarco, the Tucson-based mining, smelting and refining company for $2.6 billion in cash. Asarco had filed for bankruptcy and it also faced environment-related liabilities.        
	The Sterlite stock fell 1.5 per cent to close at Rs 750.35 on the Bombay Stock Exchange after the market learnt of the latest legal setback.        
	The final decision about which company gets Asarco will be made by US district judge Andrew Hanen in Brownsville, Texas. Grupo Mexico lost control of Asarco after putting it under court protection in 2005. Last year, Hanen ruled that Grupo Mexico intentionally harmed Asarco before putting it into bankruptcy by stripping the companys stake in Southern Copper.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Inflation creeps up to 0.57%
                                                                                                               Inflation creeps up to 0.57%

	New Delhi, April 30: Inflation rose to 0.57 per cent during the week ended April 18 on the back of costlier food and other items, but still remained close to a three-decade low.        
	Inflation increased 0.31 percentage points over the previous week, despite a high base effect of 8.23 per cent in the year-ago period.        
	The increase in inflation over the previous week is due to food prices, which have been showing some rise, the Prime Ministers economic advisory council chairman, Suresh Tendulkar, said.        
	Manufactured and fuel items also turned dearer. On a weekly basis, raw food articles rose 0.6 per cent, but turned expensive by 7.39 per cent year-on-year. Prices of manufactured food items were up 1.9 per cent week-on-week, but rose 11.38 per cent on a yearly basis.         
	Many analysts expected inflation to turn negative by the end of the last fiscal. Some economists said costly food items had restricted the downward spiral, but the high base effect was sure to drive inflation below zero shortly.

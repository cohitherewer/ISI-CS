The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Anil seeks public opinion on price
                                                                                                               Anil seeks public opinion on price
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Mumbai, Aug .17: The Anil Ambani group has tried to whip up public support ahead of a crucial court battle with Reliance Industries over the supply of gas from the fields in the Krishna-Godavari basin.        
	The ADAG group today sought views from the public on the supply of gas from KG fields at the government-determined price of $4.20 per million British thermal units (mBtu).         
	Through advertisements in various newspapers, the group attacked the Centre by saying the petroleum ministry wanted state-owned power utility National Thermal Power Corporation to pay a price that was 80 per cent higher than what the latter had itself offered to the corporation.         
	It said NTPC would suffer a loss of up to Rs 30,000 crore as a result. On the other hand, RIL would make a super-normal profit of nearly Rs 50,000 crore and the government would get only Rs 500 crore. Is this in public or national interest? the advertisement asked and sought a public response to the question.         
	According to the group, this was issued in public and national interest on behalf of its nearly 8 million shareholders.

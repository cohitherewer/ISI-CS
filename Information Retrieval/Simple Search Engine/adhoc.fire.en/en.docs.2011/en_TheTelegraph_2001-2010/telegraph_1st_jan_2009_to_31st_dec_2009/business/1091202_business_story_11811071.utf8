          OUR LEGAL REPORTER AMP; PTI                              
	Calcutta, Dec. 1: A division bench of Calcutta High Court today passed an interim order that allowed Dunlop India Limited to remove finished products from its factory premises till December 7, after an earlier order by a trial bench to maintain status quo.        
	Dunlop, owned by Pawan Ruia, will commence production from tomorrow.        
	The direction came after the management of the tyre-maker moved the division bench challenging the trial court order, which, it said, would hamper the companys production plans.         
	In the interim order, valid till Monday, the division bench comprising acting Chief Justice Bhaskar Bhattacharya and Justice Prasenjit Mandal ordered that the rest of the status quo order passed by the trial bench would remain in place.         
	The bench ordered that only finished products would be allowed to be taken out of the company premises till Monday when the matter would be taken up for hearing again.         
	Trial court judge Pranab Chattopadhyay yesterday ordered a status quo on the removal of machinery and assets from the companys premises on a petition by creditor P.V. Mathaiah seeking quashing of relief undertaking status given by the Bengal government to Dunlop.         
	The undertaking, which gives certain immunity to a sick company after being taken over by a new management, was given by the government through a notification of June 10 under the West Bengal Relief Undertaking Act.

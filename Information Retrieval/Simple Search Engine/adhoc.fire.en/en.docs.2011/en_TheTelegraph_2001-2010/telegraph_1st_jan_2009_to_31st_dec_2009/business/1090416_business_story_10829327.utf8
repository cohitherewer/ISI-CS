The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Stocks ignore warning
                                                                                                               Stocks ignore warning
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                             
	Mumbai, April 15: Stocks staged a remarkable rally today after coming under initial pressure as Infosys dished out a disappointing guidance. The BSE sensex surged nearly 565 points from its intra-day low and ended at a six-month high of 11284.73 on strong buying in banks, capital goods and realty stocks.         
	The close marked a gain of 317.51 points, and it is the eighth rally in a row. The strong show came despite analysts warning that should Infosys project a revenue fall for the current fiscal, share values could take a beating.         
	Infosyss results came before market hours, affecting the sensexs opening, which was lower at 10805.14. The index dipped to an intra-day low of 10719.18 as investors aggressively sold IT stocks.         
	Stability soon returned on the back of strong buying in many other counters. Market circles said while investors had expected Infosys to project a fall in dollar revenues, hopes that the global economy was on a recovery path triggered a rally. Apart from domestic investors, foreign institutional investors were also seen making purchases. The FIIs had pumped in over Rs 580 crore on Monday, according to provisional figures.         
	Shares of realty, capital goods, power and banks were the major gainers of the day, while IT shares lost out. The realty pack led the list of gainers. The BSE realty index surged nearly 9 per cent on strong showing by counters such as DLF, which gained 10 per cent to close at Rs 256.80. This apart, capital goods shares such as Larsen amp; Toubro also contributed to the gain.         
	Commenting on the rally, Arun Kejriwal, director of KRIS, said this came even as cues coming from the global markets were not positive. Investors perhaps feel that the Infosys guidance could be an exception and that other sectors will not perform as badly.        
	Kejriwal, however, has asked retail investors to be cautious about the bullishness seen in recent times as he feels that the market fundamentals have not changed overnight.

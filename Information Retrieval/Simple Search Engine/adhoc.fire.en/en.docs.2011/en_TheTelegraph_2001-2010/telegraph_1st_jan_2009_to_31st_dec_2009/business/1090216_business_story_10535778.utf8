 												      Existing home loan borrowers can shift to schemes offering lower interest rates, says Srikumar Bondyopadhyay                        
	Home loans have become cheaper. But existing borrowers have little to cheer.         
	Beginning December, banks and housing finance companies started slashing their lending rates. But the discount in interest rates for existing borrowers is far less than that for new sign-ups.         
	One can now get a home loan of Rs 20 lakh at an interest rate of 9.25 per cent, whereas an existing borrower will still have to pay between 11 per cent and 11.75 per cent.         
	Rules of the game        
	A bank or a housing finance company fixes its floating home loan rate at a discount to its benchmark prime lending rate (PLR). So, unless the bank reduces its PLR, the floating home loan rate doesnt come down. But, under special home loan offers, banks and housing finance companies offer a higher discount and hence a much lower lending rate to new customers.        
	Moreover, different lenders follow different rate reset cycles  the period after which a changed rate becomes applicable.         
	For example, HDFC reduced its prime lending rate by 0.50 percentage point in early December 2008. The interest rate for its (as well as for HDFC Banks) existing home loan borrowers declined to 11.25 per cent from 11.75 per cent. An existing borrower, however, will continue to repay the home loan at the rate of 11.75 per cent and the new rate will be applicable only after three months from the date when the loan was originally disbursed.         
	For example, if you have taken the loan in December, your EMIs will be adjusted to 11.25 per cent interest rate from March.         
	In the case of the State Bank of India, the revised rate is reset from the same day when the change becomes effective.         
	For ICICI Bank customers, the benefit of rate reduction started accruing from January  the bank announced the rate reduction from December 31, 2008. ICICI Bank resets the changed rates on specified dates of a year January 1, April 1, July 1, and October 1.        
	However, even after a 0.5 percentage point cut in its floating reference rate with effect from December 31, 2008, the interest rate for existing borrowers of ICICI Bank came down to 12.5 per cent from 13 per cent for a Rs 20-lakh loan. A new borrower can enjoy the same loan at a floating interest rate of 11 per cent under certain new schemes.        
	The existing borrowers of the SBI will also continue to pay between 9.75 per cent and 10.25 per cent (depending on the tenure of the loan), while a new borrower can get a loan at 8 per cent under its Happy Home Loan offer till April 30 this year. However, the 8 per cent interest rate is fixed for one year, that is, till April 30, 2010. After that it will be on a par with the ruling rate at that point of time.         
	Transfer trick        
	Unfortunately, existing borrowers of the SBI cannot transfer their entire outstanding home loan principal to the Happy Home Loan offer. They can get the 8 per cent interest rate benefit only up to 10 per cent of their outstanding balance under the banks Lifestyle Home Loan offer.        
	The thumb rule is that for every 0.25 percentage point rise or fall in home loan rate, the equated monthly instalment (EMI) for a 20-year loan increases or decreases by Rs 16 per Rs 1 lakh loan taken. In the case of a 15-year loan, the saving in EMI per Rs 1 lakh loan is Rs 15. It is Rs 14 and Rs 13 per Rs 1 lakh loan for 10 years and 5 years, respectively.         
	Thus, an existing borrower of the SBI, who has taken a loan for 20 years, will lose Rs 130 per month, or Rs 1,560 for one year for every Rs 1 lakh loan outstanding, as he/she is denied the benefit of lower interest rate under its Happy Home Loan offer.         
	However, the SBI will take over loans from other banks under this new scheme till April 30, 2009. Thus existing borrowers of ICICI Bank will save Rs 3,456 in terms of interest outgo on every Rs 1 lakh loan outstanding if they switch to the SBI at 8 per cent interest instead of the 12.5 per cent they are paying.         
	Even after paying a 2 per cent penalty (on the loan outstanding) for foreclosure of the loan with ICICI Bank and shifting it to the SBI, they will be able to save Rs 1,456 in the 12 months till April 2010.         
	Customers of HDFC and HDFC Bank, too, can save between Rs 880 and Rs 496 per Rs 1 lakh loan outstanding by foreclosing their loans and moving over to the SBI.        
	Tax poser        
	Let us now consider the income tax aspect. A home loan involves twin tax benefits  you can claim a maximum deduction of Rs 1 lakh on repayment of the principal amount under Section 80C, and, second, you can claim a maximum deduction of Rs 1.5 lakh in a financial year on interest payment under Section 24.         
	Now, when the home loan rates come down, your interest burden comes down  you either choose to lower your EMI or shorten the loan tenure. Thus, in the next financial year, youll be able to claim less deduction under Section 24.         
	If you choose to pay the same EMI and repay the loan faster, you can claim higher deduction on the principal repayment, provided you have not exhausted all of the Rs 1 lakh available under Section 80C.         
	If you choose a lower EMI, you can either invest the savings in interest outgo or utilise it to take a top-up loan, if you need one.        
	Now, the question is what will happen to the interest rate next year?         
	Given the current trend, interest rates will come down further in the coming months of this year. So, by locking into an 8 per cent interest rate in the SBIs Happy Home Loan offer, you run the risk of not getting the benefits in case the lending rates fall below 8 per cent. But probability of that risk seems almost zero given the spread of 2.25 to 4.5 percentage points between the home loan rates of other banks and that in the Happy Home Loan offer.         
	But you will certainly have to pay a higher interest rate after April 30, 2010, when the SBI proposes to restore the 8 per cent interest rate to its prevailing home loan rates at that point of time.

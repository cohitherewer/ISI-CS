          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Calcutta, Jan. 19: Allahabad Bank today reported a 28 per cent jump in operating profit at Rs 666.06 crore for the quarter ended December 31, 2008 from Rs 521.12 crore a year ago. Net profit remained flat at Rs 369.47 crore for the quarter compared with Rs 365.05 crore in the corresponding period last year.        
	Net profit remained flat because we had to make higher provisions for income tax and increased wages of employees, said K.R. Kamath, chairman and managing director of Allahabad Bank.        
	The bank allocated Rs 193.61 crore for income taxes in the quarter compared with Rs 31.06 crore a year ago. Total provisioning stood at Rs 296.59 crore against Rs 156.07 crore in the previous year.         
	Net profit for the nine months (April to December) of the current financial year declined 37.35 per cent to Rs 504.51 crore from Rs 805.23 crore a year ago despite 15.99 per cent growth in operating profit.         
	We had to take a huge hit of Rs 334.46 crore on account of depreciation in investment during the first two quarters of the current financial year, said Kamath.         
	The bank was able to write back Rs 68.07 crore from investment provisioning in the third quarter after the rate of interest started declining, giving rise to capital gains from bonds and government securities.         
	Total provisioning for the nine months ended December 31, 2008, was higher at Rs 782.49 crore than Rs 304.31 crore a year ago.

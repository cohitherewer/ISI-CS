	Mumbai, May 17: Private equity deals are likely to pick up with the return of the UPA.        
	Deal-makers and investment bankers are confident that with the Left out of the picture and a majority government free to push reforms faster, more foreign money in the form of private equity (PE) is likely to flow into the country.        
	So far, big private equity firms in India were selling the consumption story to their head offices in the United States. Now, theyre going to talk about reforms  regulatory and governance-oriented, said a banker working with a global firm in India.  
	Whether it is privatisation or more public-private-partnership projects, this government is expected to push proposals. That is attractive to foreigners waiting for an opportunity in this market, said Ernst amp; Youngs transaction advisory director Jayesh Desai.        
	Coincidentally, the April numbers for PE investments have picked up. Merger and acquisition activity has also increased marginally.         
	C. G. Srividya, Grant Thornton partner (transaction support services), said, On the private equity front, we are seeing some increase in the deal values in April compared with the first three months of the year. There has also been a marginal increase in pure play M amp;A activities (excluding restructuring) in April compared with March this year.        
	According to Grant Thornton, several group restructuring activities were carried out in April but these deals and their values have not been announced yet and factored into the data collated by the firm.        
	Fifteen private equity deals were announced in April 2009 with an announced value of $493.94 million, according to Grant Thornton.         
	The number of PE deals in the first four months of 2009 stood at 56 with an announced value of $1.31 billion.         
	However, the numbers are not impressive compared to last year.         
	In the first four months of 2008, 149 PE deals worth $4.68 billion were struck.         
	Mergers and acquisitions have been much slower this year against 2008. However, that is expected to change.        
	Grant Thornton data show 20 M amp;A transactions (excluding group restructuring deals) worth $427.55 million were announced in April this year.         
	There were 13 domestic deals (both acquirer and target being Indian) with an announced value of $351.33 million and seven cross-border deals worth $76.22 million.         
	Four of the cross-border deals were outbound, that is Indian companies acquiring entities outside the country. These were valued at $31.78 million.         
	Three were inbound deals  international companies or their subsidiaries acquiring Indian business  with an announced value of $44.44 million.         
	The total number of M amp;A deals (excluding group mergers and restructuring deals) during the first four months of 2009 were 74 with an announced value of $2.03 billion compared with 174 deals worth $9.43 billion in the corresponding period in 2008.

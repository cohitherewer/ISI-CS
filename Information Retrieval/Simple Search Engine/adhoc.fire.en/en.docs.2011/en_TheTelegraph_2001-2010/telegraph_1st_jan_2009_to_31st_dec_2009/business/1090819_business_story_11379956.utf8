          OUR CORRESPONDENT                          Goenka: Planning ahead                                  
	New Delhi, Aug. 18: RPG Groups Spencers Retail plans to invest Rs 100 crore in expansion in this fiscal.         
	The retail chain  which had shut down over 100 stores because of declining sales and high rentals  plans to tie up with global apparel brands.         
	The company was looking at expanding the US-based Beverly Hills Polo Club brand, with which it had entered into a deal last year. It will raise the number of Beverly Hills Polo standalone stores to 10 in the next six months from three. We are planning to invest Rs 100 crore this year in expanding our retail business. This will cover both the Beverly Hills Polo brands as well as 10-12 large format Spencers stores we plan to open during the next six months, said Sanjiv Goenka, vice-chairman of RPG Enterprises.        
	We are in discussions with three international apparel players, and we are hopeful of bringing them to the country soon, he said. Goenka, however, refused to disclose further details, including the names of the brands or the nature of the tie-ups.         
	The period of shutdowns is now over. We have opened five large format stores in the past three months, and all have reported sales amounting to Rs 1,000 per square feet a day, more than double the normal sales rate. So we are optimistic about revival, Goenka said.        
	The company has also entered into an agreement with French bakery chain Au Bon Pan and will open the first outlet in Bangalore in October.        
	Besides, we have just finalised agreements with another western high-fashion apparel players and will be launching it in the country in the next few months, he said.        
	We are ready to launch more such brands under exclusive agreements. Our tie up with Beverly Hills Polo has shown good results, and we plan to have a total of 10 outlets of the brand in Delhi and NCR (National Capital Region) within the next six months, he said.         
	Spencers Retail today opened its third Beverly Hills Polo outlet here.        
	The company, which had a turnover of around Rs 1,000 crore in 2008-09, has registered an 18 per cent growth in its mainstream grocery business during the first quarter of this fiscal.        
	Goenka said Spencers was exploring the revenue-sharing model with realty owners for its new stores.         
	The realty players should also consider this option seriously. Although rentals in many markets are down 20-25 per cent than the peak rate two years ago. I believe, there is still scope for more course correction, he said.        
	On plans to raise fresh equity he said, Not at the moment, but we might look into it towards the last quarter of the fiscal.

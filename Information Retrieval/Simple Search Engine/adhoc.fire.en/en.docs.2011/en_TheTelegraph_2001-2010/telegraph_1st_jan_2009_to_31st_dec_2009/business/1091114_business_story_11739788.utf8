          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Calcutta, Nov. 13: A city court has restrained FMCG giant Hindustan Unilever Ltd (HUL) from running its Vaseline advertisement either in the print or in any other audio-visual medium irrespective of language, till further orders.         
	The ex-parte order was passed on November 7, Emami said in a statement today.         
	HUL has appealed against the order in the same court.        
	The verdict comes in the wake of a petition by Emami, seeking a court injunction to restrain HUL from telecasting, broadcasting or publishing a Vaseline advertisement; Emami said the advertisement disparaged its Boroplus brand.         
	However, according to the latest monitoring report, HUL has not stopped showing the advertisement as of Wednesday, Harsh Agarwal, director of Emami, said.        
	HUL should have stopped but has not done so, he said.        
	Boroplus is one of the largest brand in Emamis portfolio. It is the market leader in the antiseptic cream segment with annual sales of over Rs 200 crore. Boropluss market share is about 70 per cent.        
	The Calcutta-based group is worth Rs 750 crore and has brands such as Navratna, Fair and Handsome, Sona Chandi Chyawanprash, Mentho Plus, and Himani Fast Relief.        
	Emami last year acquired century-old Zandu Pharmaceuticals of Mumbai after a prolonged bid battle.        
	The Emami scrip gained Rs 2.30, or 0.49 per cent, to end at Rs 471 on the Bombay Stock Exchange today.

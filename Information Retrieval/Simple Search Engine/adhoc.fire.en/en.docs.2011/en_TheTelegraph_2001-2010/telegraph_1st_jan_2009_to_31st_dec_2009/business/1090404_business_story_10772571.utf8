The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Auto parts firms keep close watch on GM
                                                                                                               Auto parts firms keep close watch on GM
          GARIMA SINGH NEOGY                          CHAIN REACTION                                  
	New Delhi, April 3: Local auto parts firms are dreading to think what will happen in case General Motors files for bankruptcy.         
	Component exports to the US are at $1-1.5 billion, and the industry is fearing the non-payment of dues by GM, which has just 60 days to put its house in order, can seriously dent their fortune.         
	There is a good chunk of component manufacturers who are dependent on the US market. They will suffer a setback. Some of them may even be wiped off, said Jayant Davar, vice-president of the Automotive Component Manufacturers Association of India (Acma).         
	Acma members exported $3.6 billion worth of auto parts in the year ended March 31, 2008, of which 27 per cent were to the US.         
	These were mostly to vendors as well as direct sales to GM, Ford and Chrysler.        
	GM has warned that it may have to file for bankruptcy if the US government does not bail it out. A filing under Chapter 11 of the US bankruptcy code will protect GM from creditors, while it restructures its operations under court supervision.        
	Unless suppliers have taken export credit guarantee insurance, their losses will not be covered, said an official of an Indian firm, which earns nearly 15-20 per cent of its revenues from the US.        
	Suppliers to a company are generally unsecured creditors and rank last in order of priority of payment in a normal bankruptcy filing. In most cases it is seen that creditors forgo a portion of what a company owes to them (suppliers), to allow a company to restructure itself, the official said.         
	Sumi Motherson Group chairman Vivek Chaand Sehgal said, Its too difficult to let a company like General Motors shut down. We are keeping our fingers crossed. Its a wait-and-watch situation for now.

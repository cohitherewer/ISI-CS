The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Private equity funding in slow lane
                                                                                                               Private equity funding in slow lane

	Mumbai, March 15: Private equity investment is likely to remain flat in the next six months, meaning that not much needs to be read from the slight improvement in the number and value of deals struck in February.         
	According to accountancy firm Grant Thornton, 17 deals worth $339.66 million were sealed in February compared with 14 deals worth $202 million in January this year.         
	 Promoters have stopped hankering for old valuations and are open to raising money from PE funds. Some large funds have around $3 million ready to invest in India and there are several transactions that are currently under negotiation, said Grant Thorntons director, Harish H.V.         
	All this may hint at a spurt in private equity transactions in the country.         
	However, the 25 deals struck in February 2008 were estimated at $1.30 billion compared with just $339 million in the same month this year.         
	Private equity players feel there is unlikely to be a turnaround soon, and last months number may just be a blip.         
	We have 60 to 80 deals before us. However, a bulk of these transactions is very piecemeal and there is very little opportunity for scale in these deals. It will be a while before we see a number of high quality transactions in the market once again, said Shahzaad Dalal, vice-chairman and managing director of IL amp;FS Investment Managers. According to Dalal, a large number of these transactions are in the pharmaceutical, healthcare and technology industries.         
	Another private equity player said many of the transactions were from companies looking to realign their debt commitments.        
	Several large PE funds are also facing rough weather at home and have turned cautious in their outlook despite a steep correction in valuations followed by the mayhem on the sensex.         
	Some large funds have recently exited. For instance, Singapore governments Temasek Holdings has nearly quit container-freight stations operator Gateway Distriparks. This is being seen by industry watchers as a sign that large funds facing troubles at home are looking to churn their portfolios in India.         
	Funds are in no hurry to shovel money into the sub-continent.

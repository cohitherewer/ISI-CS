The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Credit growth tops govt agenda
                                                                                                               Credit growth tops govt agenda
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                          Chandrasekhar: Proactive                                  
	New Delhi, March 19: The government will soon call a meeting of the chiefs of PSU banks to spur credit growth and rejuvenate the economy, which is staring at a 5-6 per cent growth in the next fiscal.        
	A meeting is scheduled for March 26-27. We will meet bankers and discuss the entire issue of credit disbursement, cabinet secretary K.M. Chandrasekhar said.         
	He said private banks should join their PSU peers in cutting rates.        
	Last month, after a meeting with stand-in finance minister Pranab Mukherjee, the PSU bank chiefs had agreed to cut rates.        
	While many public sector banks did cut rates by 50-100 basis points, private lenders had not shown much eagerness.        
	According to the government, banks need to complement the RBI initiative by lending more. The central bank has been aggressively reducing policy rates since the global recession shook India.        
	Since October, the RBIs repo rate, or the rate at which it lends to banks, have been revised downwards five times to 5 per cent from 8 per cent. A lower repo rate means banks can borrow and lend more.        
	The reverse repo, or the rate at which it borrows from banks, has been revised thrice since December and is at 3.50 per cent now.         
	A lower reverse repo means banks are discouraged to lend to the central bank and hence, have more money to lend.        
	The cash reserve ratio, or the portion of deposits which banks must maintain with the RBI, has also been reduced five times since October and is now at 5 per cent. Lowering CRR also increases cash in the hand of banks, giving them a greater leeway to lend.        
	Industry players, however, said that credit was still not sufficient.        
	Lenders, however, expect healthy growth in disbursement. Credit growth now is 30 per cent and we see growth at 25-26 per cent in 2008-09, said K.C. Chakrabarty, chairman and managing director of state-run Punjab National Bank.         
	Bankers say almost 75-78 per cent credit are given at rates lower than the benchmark prime lending rate to entities such as farmers, small and medium enterprises and blue-chip firms.        
	There will not be any additional lending rate cuts for now, Chakrabarty said.         
	He added that unless banks were able to reduce their deposit rates, they would not be able to offer cheap loans. Currently, PNB charges the lowest rate in the industry at 11.5 per cent.         
	Chandrasekhar said public sector banks had been far more active in the disbursal of credit to industry and asked private banks to be equally co-operative. (I) hope private banks will play their role in bringing down lending rates. he said.        
	The cabinet secretary said the 0.44 per cent inflation rate for the week ended March 7 did not mean that it would fall below zero (deflation). I do not see any sign of deflation right now. Probably, decline in inflation is more due to the higher base last year than any significant drop in prices.        
	Experts have warned that growth in 2009-10 would be 5-6 per cent, a far cry from 9 per cent growth of 2007-08. Brokerage CLSA even said that growth would be as low as 4.6 per cent.         
	For this fiscal, Pronab Sen, the governments chief statistician, had made it clear that slowing industry and services could ensure that the 7.1 per cent growth (target) is not achievable.

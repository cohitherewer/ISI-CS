  - Experts put deal dynamics under scanner
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                
	Mumbai, May 26: Bharti Airtel may have to raise over $2 billion worth of debt to pay for a 49 per cent stake in MTN, the South African telecommunications company.                    
	If the deal goes through, Bharti Airtel will have a net cash outflow of around $4 billion. The Indian telecom company has over $1 billion in cash and short-investments on its books.        
	Analysts said as part of the payment structure in the first leg of the transaction, Bharti would have to pay out South African rand (ZAR) 86 per MTN share which amounts to roughly $6.8 billion.         
	The company will get $2.9 billion from MTN and shareholders as part-payment for a 36 per cent economic interest in the Indian company.         
	The company does have over $1 billion in cash but a significant sum of money will be needed to bid for the 3G licences which will come up for auction pretty soon.         
	The company is more likely to take on debt. This will significantly raise its net-debt equity ratio, which is currently at comfortable levels, said a report by Angel Broking.        
	Another analysis by Kotak Institutional Equities Research estimates that the net cash outflow of $4 billion from Bharti will be debt-funded at a pre-tax cost of debt of 8 per cent (assuming foreign debt and including hedging costs).         
	The Kotak analysis points out that the total consideration for Bhartis 49 per cent stake in MTN work out to roughly $16.8 billion assuming Bhartis share price at Rs 860 per share (See table).         
	At Rs 860 per share of Bharti Airtel, MTNs equity valuation amounts to $34 billion, a 28 per cent premium to MTNs market capitalisation before the announcement.         
	Kotak Institutional Equities Research has also said that the deal will be EPS accretive for Bharti if it goes through in its current form.         
	However, value from the EPS accretion may be offset by the lower growth profile of MTN and higher risks attached to operations in multiple countries, the report added.

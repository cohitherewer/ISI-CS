The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Dunlop bid to soothe Sahagunj nerves
                                                                                                               Dunlop bid to soothe Sahagunj nerves
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Calcutta, March 9: Dunlop India today said it would retain all its workers at the Sahagunj plant and resume production in two months.         
	Moreover, all the workers at Sahagunj, which reopened on March 6 after remaining closed for about three months, will be given Rs 1,000 each as an ad hoc payment.        
	Keeping their needs in mind, the company will give the money to each worker of Dunlop, barring those given chargesheets, chairman Pawan Kumar Ruia said.         
	He denied that the Sahagunj unit would be converted into real estate. The company has no intention of building any colony, he said.        
	The Citu-led Dunlop Workers Union welcomed the companys decision.         
	We are happy that he (Ruia) said there would not be any retrenchments, said Dipankar Roy, general-secretary of the union. However, Bijon Sarkar, joint secretary of Intuc-led Dunlop Rubber Factory Union, said, In the past, we have seen that Ruia had not kept his promises. We stick to our demand for a tripartite meeting at the labour ministers chamber.        
	Ambattur plant fate        
	Ruia said Dunlop might wind up its Ambattur factory or shift it to some other location. If we see relocation is viable, we will go for it. But, for that, we need buyers for the property. The factory is spread over 32 acres.         
	Two to three banks are ready to provide the company Rs 50 crore to help it overcome a financial crunch.         
	The company had earlier sought a loan of Rs 100 crore from the West Bengal Industrial Development Corporation.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                           Mukherjee: Growth tips                                  
	Mumbai, Dec. 20: The governments stimulus measures at the start of the year kindled economic growth  which surged 7.9 per cent in the second quarter ended September 30  but it is now time for the private sector to crank up spending and spur consumption, finance minister Pranab Mukherjee said.         
	Mukherjee, who was here on Saturday to hand out the Businessworld Best Bank Awards, said private consumption expenditure was nowhere near the levels seen before the global financial crisis erupted in September 2008.         
	The finance minister  who forecast a robust economic growth of 7.75 per cent for the year ended March 31  said the onus was now on India Inc to seize the opportunities that had been thrown up by a resurgent economy.         
	Banks must look to disburse more credit to bankroll corporate investments and provide a wide suite of services through a variety of savings, insurance and remittance products, he said.         
	Mukherjees advice is significant as they come at a time when the Reserve Bank of India has started talking about unwinding the stimulus measures. Weak private consumption and investment demand continue to be a key drag on faster recovery, the RBI had said in its second quarter review of monetary policy in late October.         
	Growth in private consumption demand fell to as low as 1.6 per cent in the first quarter of 2009-10, the RBI said.         
	Mukherjee and the RBI do not want to see the economy falter again as they prepare to unwind some of the pump-priming measures, which are widely anticipated next month.         
	Bankers had turned out in full force to witness the star-studded inaugural Businessworld event. Those present included Om Prakash Bhatt, chairman of the State Bank of India, Neeraj Swaroop, chief executive for India and South Asia, Standard Chartered Bank, Axis Bank CEO Shikha Sharma, IDBI Bank chairman Yogesh Agarwal, Kalpana Morparia, CEO of JPMorgan India, Corporation Bank chairman J.M. Garg, M.S. Sundara Rajan, chairman of Indian Bank, and M.V. Nair, chairman and managing director of the Union Bank of India.         
	Industry stalwarts who attended the event included TCS managing director N. Chandrasekaran, Videocon group chairman Venugopal Dhoot, Suzlon Energy chairman Tulsi Tanti and Financial Technologies chairman Jignesh Shah.         
	The star of the night was the State Bank of India and its chief .P. Bhatt. The SBI was named the best large bank and was also honoured as the most socially responsible bank. Bhatt was named the banker of the year.         
	The awards, brought in partnership with PricewaterhouseCoopers and presented by TCS, classified the banks into three groups  small, medium and large, based on the size of their balance sheets.         
	Corporation Bank was rated as the best mid-size bank and Deutsche Bank won the award for the best small bank.         
	The banks were analysed on a set of parameters, following which a shortlist was prepared and then given to an eminent jury who picked the final winner in each category.         
	The jury comprised Kalpana Morparia, Rashesh Shah, chairman and CEO of Edelweiss Capital, A.K. Purwar, former SBI chief and chairman of India Venture Advisors, and M.B. N. Rao, former chairman of Canara Bank.         
	Axis Bank won the award for the fastest growing large bank. It had to compete with the SBI, HDFC Bank, the Bank of India and IDBI Bank.                                       
	Chennai-based Indian Bank was honoured as the fastest growing mid-size bank and Yes Bank got the award for the fastest growing small bank.         
	HDFC Bank was adjudged the most tech-friendly bank.

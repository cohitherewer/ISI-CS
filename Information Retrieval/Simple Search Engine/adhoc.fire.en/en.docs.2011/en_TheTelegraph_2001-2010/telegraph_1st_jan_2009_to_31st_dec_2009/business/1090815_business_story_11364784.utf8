          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      Cash chase                          
	Mumbai, Aug. 14: JSW Energy, a Sajjan-Jindal controlled JSW group company, plans to launch an initial public offering to raise up to Rs 3,000 crore.        
	The company, which has filed its draft red herring prospectus with the Sebi for the IPO, joins other power companies such as Adani Power and state-owned NHPC who have tapped the capital markets recently.         
	Market observers, however, reckon that the company will choose to wait for the skittish markers to stabilise before floating the IPO.        
	We have been seeing IPOs at the rate of just about one per month. Eighteen companies are holding Sebi approvals for IPOs to raise about Rs 6,000 crore. However, it will be unfair to say that the IPO market has taken off even though the pipeline is strong. How much is converted to actual offering depends on whether the market is buoyant or stable for at least a month at a stretch, said Prithvi Haldea of Prime Database, a company tracking capital markets.         
	Proceeds from the JSW Energy IPO will be largely used to fund power projects.         
	According to the company, at least 60 per cent of the net issue will be allocated on a proportionate basis to qualified institutional buyers, of which 5 per cent will be available on a proportionate basis only to mutual funds.         
	The company also said that not less than 10 per cent of the net issue would be available to non-institutional bidders and not less than 30 per cent would be for retail bidders.

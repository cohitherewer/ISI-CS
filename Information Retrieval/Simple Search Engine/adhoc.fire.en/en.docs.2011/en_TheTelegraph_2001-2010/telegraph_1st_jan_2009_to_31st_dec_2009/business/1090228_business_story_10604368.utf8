The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Four to join Maytas board
                                                                                                               Four to join Maytas board
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Feb. 27: The Company Law Board (CLB) today decided to appoint four independent directors on the board of Maytas Infrastucture, including a chairman.        
	I would appoint four persons on the board of the company (Maytas Infra) that I have in mind. Out of that four, one would be appointed as chairman, said CLB chairman S. Balasubramanian.        
	The move was accepted by Maytas Infras counsel. At present, the company has three board members  vice-chairman B. Teja Raju, additional director B. Narasimha Rao and independent director R.P. Raju.        
	The CLB chairman, however, refused to accept the names suggested by the Maytas counsel for the post of independent directors.        
	The quasi-judicial board today reiterated its hesitation to supersede the board as suggested by the government. It asked the government to furnish evidence supporting the demand.         
	You want to supersede at this stage. I disagree. Show me the material evidence. I want to see it before taking any decision. I have to follow principles of law and cannot go merely on allegations, said Balasubramanian.         
	Tell me incidences, how is the company suffering? How are they not discharging their duties? How has it affected public interest, the CLB chairman said after the government failed to present material evidence against Maytas Infra.         
	You are at an interim stage. Investigations are going on. Bring more material evidence based on that, he said.         
	The government has opposed the appointment of independent directors by the CLB. It again suggested that the current Maytas board be replaced by nominees of the department of corporate affairs.        
	The central government has no faith in the present management of the company, said a deputy director appearing on behalf of the government.         
	Maytas Infra creditors  IDBI, ICICI Banks and IL amp;FS  today said that they do not want any representation on the board. They requested the CLB to appoint experts. They pleaded that the present directors should refrain from participating in the board meeting in greater public interest.

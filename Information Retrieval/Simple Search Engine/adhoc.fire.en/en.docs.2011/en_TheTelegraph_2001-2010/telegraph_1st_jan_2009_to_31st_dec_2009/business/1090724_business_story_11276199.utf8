          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, July 23: The government today imposed a three-year lock-in on the sale of promoter equity in telecom companies that were given licences in early 2008. The move is aimed at preventing the promoters from making windfall profits.        
	However, there will be no lock-in when a strategic investor subscribes to fresh equity, as in the case of the Unitech-Telenor and the Swan-Etisalat deals.         
	While the UAEs Etisalat bought a 45 per cent stake in Swan Telecom for $900 million, Unitech divested up to 67.25 per cent in its telecom venture to Norways Telenor for $1.1 billion. Chennai based S Tel had also sold 49 per cent to Bahrains Batelco for about $225 million. These companies maintained that they did not offload stakes but issued fresh equity to the foreign partners.         
	The lock-in clause can affect the expansion plans of Datacom (owned by the Dhoots of Videocon and Mahendra Nahata of Himachal Futuristics) and the Essar groups Loop Telecom, who are in talks with foreign players for a stake sale.        
	There shall be a lock-in-period for sale of equity of a person whose share capital is 10 per cent or more in the company, effective from the date of licence till completion of three years or till fulfilment of the rollout obligations, whichever is earlier, the department of telecommunications (DoT) said in a statement.        
	Such a person shall not transfer in any manner, such as sale, assignment etc, his share capital directly or indirectly to any other person during the lock-in period, the DoT said.        
	3G spectrum meet        
	The panel of ministers, led by finance minister Pranab Mukherjee, formed to look into the auction policy and pricing of third-generation spectrum will meet for the first time on July 31. The panel is expected to give its approval to setting the reserve price for the auction at Rs 4,040 crore.         
	Meanwhile, mobile number portability will be delayed by at least three months from its scheduled implementation date as the telecom regulator is still busy preparing regulations for the new system.

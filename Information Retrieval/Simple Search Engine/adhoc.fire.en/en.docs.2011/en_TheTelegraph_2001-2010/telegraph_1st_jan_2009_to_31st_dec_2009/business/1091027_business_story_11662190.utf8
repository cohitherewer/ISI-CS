The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Reliance resumes gas supply to Anil firm
                                                                                                               Reliance resumes gas supply to Anil firm
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT AMP; PTI                              
	New Delhi, Oct. 26: Reliance Industries today resumed the supply of natural gas to the Anil Ambani groups power plant in Andhra Pradesh after the company agreed to pay all the charges on the fuel.        
	In view of you having paid the amounts due, including the marketing margin according to the last invoice... we propose to resume supply of gas with effect from October 26, RIL has said.        
	Reliance Infrastructure had stopped paying $0.135 per mBtu (million British thermal unit) marketing margin charged by RIL on the sale of 0.56 mmscmd (million metric standard cubic metres per day) of gas to its 220MW Samalkot power plant. This prompted RIL to suspend supplies. Reliance Infrastructure relented but said it would pay the marketing margin under protest.        
	Meanwhile, an empowered group of ministers (eGoM) headed by finance minister Pranab Mukherjee will meet tomorrow to decide on the allocation of additional gas produced by RIL from the KG basin.        
	The production from KG fields will be ramped up in phases to 80 million metric standard cubic metres per day. The eGoM will consider making a part of the allocation on a firm basis and the rest on a fall-back basis, officials said.        
	The government had allocated the initial 40 mmscmd from the D6 fields to fertiliser units, power plants, city gas projects, LPG plants and the steel sector. The eGoM will consider allocating an additional 20 mmscmd to power and fertiliser units on a firm basis.

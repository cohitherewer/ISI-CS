The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Exports show signs of revival
                                                                                                               Exports show signs of revival
          R. SURYAMURTHY                          Zhong Shan, Chinese vice-minister of commerce, with commerce secretary G.K Pillai in New Delhi on Thursday. (AFP)                                  
	New Delhi, March 19: Exports of textiles, leather and gems and jewellery, which had contracted in the past few months, are showing signs of recovery.        
	The first quarter of the next fiscal will show signs of stability and from there how it goes will depend on the global economic recovery, commerce secretary G.K. Pillai said. He said there were signs that the global economy would pick up from July.        
	Analysts said the quick estimate of exports for March had sent some positive signals.        
	There is a positive sign as orders have started flowing, but the quantity is not much. The good thing is that the contraction has stopped, R.K. Dalmia, president of Century Textiles, said.        
	The analysts said the weakening of the rupee would help exporters. Labour intensive industries such as textiles and garments, gems and jewellery and leather would benefit the most.        
	Rajiv Jain, vice-chairman of the Gems and Jewellery Export Promotion Council, said, The sentiments are positive and April is a crucial month, which will indicate the direction we are going.        
	However, D.K. Nair, secretary of the Confederation of Indian Textile Industry, said, There are no numbers available to suggest that exports have recovered. However, the numbers from textile mills suggest that there is a decline in the rate of contraction, which means the declining trend seems to be tapering off.        
	Pillai said exports in this fiscal would be higher than last years $162 billion. However, it might miss the target of $175 billion.        
	China toys        
	China may approach the WTO against India over the import curbs on its toys even as it is in bilateral talks to resolve the dispute.        
	We do not rule out litigation at the WTO. But (now), we are (in) bilateral consultation, Chinese vice-minister of commerce Zhong Shan said after his meeting with Pillai.        
	India has lifted the ban on Chinese toys imposed in January but retained the safety standards on the imports.

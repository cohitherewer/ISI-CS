The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Ambanis get ready for court battle
                                                                                                               Ambanis get ready for court battle
                            
	New Delhi, Oct. 19 (PTI): Two of Indias leading companies  headed by estranged industrialist brothers Mukesh and Anil Ambani  are set for a showdown in the Supreme Court, which will commence hearing on their gas supply dispute tomorrow.        
	Justice R.V. Raveendran has replaced Justice B.S. Chauhan on the three- member bench of the Supreme Court that will hear the case. The other two members are Chief Justice K.G. Balakrishnan and Justice P. Sathasivam.        
	The fight relates to supply of gas to Anil Ambani groups Reliance Natural Resources from the KG-D6 fields of Mukesh-led Reliance Industries.        
	Meanwhile, the government has told the apex court that it was well within its rights to file a petition in the gas dispute, as its interests have been prejudiced by Bombay High Court.         
	Replying to RNRLs contention that the government could not make a plea as it was not a party before Bombay High Court, the Centre said since the court order was detrimental to its rights to regulate natural resources, its petition could be maintained with the apex courts permission.         
	The order of Bombay High Court is clearly detrimental to the governments ability to regulate natural gas supply and distribution as it privileges a private arrangement over the governments utilisation policy, it stated.

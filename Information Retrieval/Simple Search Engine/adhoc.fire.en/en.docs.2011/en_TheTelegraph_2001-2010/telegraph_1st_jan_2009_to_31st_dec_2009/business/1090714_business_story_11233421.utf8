                                                                                                               Panel to take a call on 3G price, auction
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, July 13: The Centre today set up an empowered group of ministers, led by finance minister Pranab Mukherjee, to look into the auction and pricing for third-generation (3G) mobile services.         
	The ministerial panel is expected to fix the reserve price for 3G auction at Rs 4,040 crore. The ministers will also decide on the amount of spectrum for sale, number of players in each circle, annual fee for using 3G radiowaves and other administrative charges.        
	The Prime Ministers Office and the finance ministry expect the 3G auction to attract foreign players resulting in higher revenues.        
	Prime Minister Manmohan Singh wants the 3G service to be available as soon as possible. Therefore, the panel will expedite the process of decision making. The auction can take place within two months of the panel finalising the base price and slots to be auctioned, said officials in the department of telecom.        
	According to budget estimates, the sale of 3G spectrum will enable the government to mop up Rs 35,000 crore.        
	Other members on the panel are Union home minister P. Chidambaram, telecom minister A. Raja, defence minister A.K. Antony, information and broadcasting minister Ambika Soni, agriculture minister Sharad Pawar and Planning Commission deputy chairman Montek Singh Ahluwalia.        
	After the auction, winners will need three-five months to roll out the high-speed services.        
	Global players such as the Americas AT amp;T, Germanys Deutsche Telekom, Frances Orange and Japans NTT DoCoMo are keen on 3G.         
	Domestic companies such as Bharti Airtel, Vodafone Essar, Reliance Communications, Tata Teleservices and new operators such as Unitech-Telenor and Sistema Shyam are also in the 3G race.        
	Differences among ministries over the floor price and the number of players have prompted the cabinet to form a group of ministers. There were also many pending court cases.

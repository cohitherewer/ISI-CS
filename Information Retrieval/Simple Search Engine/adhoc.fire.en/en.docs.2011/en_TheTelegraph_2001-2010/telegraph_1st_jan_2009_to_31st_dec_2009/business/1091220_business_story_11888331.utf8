          SOUNAK MITRA                          FLAVOUR MISSING                                  
	Calcutta, Dec. 19: Bangladesh has witnessed a drastic fall in tea exports because of a sharp rise in domestic demand.         
	The country now exports below 10 per cent of its total tea production compared with 90 per cent a few years back.        
	Rising internal consumption may see the country importing tea over the next 5-6 years, according to industry experts.        
	Bangladesh, which had earlier competed with major exporting countries such as Kenya, India and Sri Lanka, consumes around 50 million kg of tea every year.        
	At present, Bangladesh exports about 5-6 million kg annually. Of the total exports, 82 per cent is shipped to Pakistan. Other importers include Afghanistan, Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan.         
	According to Bangladesh Tea Board, domestic consumption has nearly doubled over the last decade.         
	With demand rising and production falling, there has also been a steep hike in prices, which in turn has affected the interest of international buyers.         
	Annual output has remained static for the last 10 years  between 53 million kg and 56 million kg  except 2005 and 2008 when the figures were 60 million and 58 million kg, respectively.         
	This years projection is around 56 million kg.        
	Between 1985 and 1990, Bangladesh exported up to 90 per cent of its tea.

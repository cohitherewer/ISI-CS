                                                                                                               Britannia weighs options
          SOUNAK MITRA                                            
	Calcutta, Oct. 22: Britannia Industries is planning to relocate its sales team for the eastern region from 15 Taratala Road.        
	During a meeting with the workers union today, a five-member management team, headed by vice-president and chief technology officer Rajesh Kumar Lal, told the representatives that the company planned to shift the sales team from Taratala. However, it did not say where the team would be relocated, a source who attended the meeting told The Telegraph.        
	When contacted, a Britannia spokesperson said, Yes, a meeting was held today. We are looking at various options to protect the companys business and safeguard employees interests. The spokesperson refused to divulge any specific details of the meeting, but did not deny the issue either.        
	The union is not too happy with the decision. We have requested the company management not to relocate the sales team, which takes care of the entire eastern region, from 15 Taratala Road, a source in the union said.         
	At present, there are about 200 management cadre officers and 300 workmen along with a large number of contract labourers at Taratala. A large number of the employees are engaged in sales. The manufacturing, planning, logistics and sales operations for the eastern region are done from Taratala.        
	The Telegraph had reported on Thursday that the Calcutta Port Trust (CPT) had served an eviction notice to Britannia on October 15 telling the company to vacate the Taratala premises  Britannia had leased the property from the CPT  in 15 days.        
	In an e-mailed statement, the company said, Britannia will take necessary steps to protect the company against such draconian action, whilst ensuring that the legitimate and fair interests of its employees are safeguarded.        
	According to the source in the union, Britannia will seek a stay order on the CPT notice. The union members expressed their willingness to co-operate with the company management to sort out the dispute with the CPT, the source said.

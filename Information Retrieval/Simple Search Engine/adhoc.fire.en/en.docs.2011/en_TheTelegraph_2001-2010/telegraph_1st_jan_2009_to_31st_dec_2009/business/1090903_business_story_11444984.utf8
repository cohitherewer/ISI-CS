          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          N. Bhalla in Calcutta on Wednesday. A Telegraph picture                                  
	Calcutta, Sept. 2: Oil India Ltd, which will come out with its maiden IPO on Monday, will start drilling activities in Libya next month.        
	The company is also talking to a few foreign companies for acquiring oil and gas blocks overseas.        
	In May last year, a consortia of Oil India, Indian Oil Corporation and Sonatarch of Algeria signed an agreement with the National Oil Corporation of Libya to explore and produce gas from six blocks. Oil India, which is the operator of the project, will drill four wells before 2011.         
	We are before schedule and will start our first well drilling in Area 86 followed by another in Area 102 beginning October this year with a budgeted investment of $11 million, said N. Bhalla, executive director (corporate affairs) of Oil India Ltd. The Libya project is estimated to have a reserve of 2 trillion cubic metres of gas and 95 million barrels of condensate with possible oil.         
	We are also talking to 3-4 foreign companies to buy oil blocks overseas, Bhalla said. He declined to give details and only said that the blocks were already producing oil.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Insurers can club life and health cover
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Insurers can club life and health cover
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Calcutta, Dec. 23: The insurance regulator today allowed non-life and life insurance companies to jointly offer a combination of health and life insurance policies.         
	Health-plus-life policies  a combination of pure term life insurance (sold by life insurers) and mediclaim plans (offered by general insurance companies)  will provide life cover along with health insurance to subscribers.         
	Though both non-life and life insurance companies offer standalone health insurance plans (life insurance companies also offer health riders in the form of critical illness), they differ significantly.         
	While the mediclaims being offered by non-life insurance companies are indemnity plans that pay out the sum assured or the treatment cost, whichever is lower, the standalone health insurance plans offered by life insurance companies are defined-benefit plans that give a predefined lump sum irrespective of the treatment cost (such as hospitalisation benefit).        
	Besides, the medical insurance plans of non-life insurance companies are short-term plans which a policyholder has to renew every year and the renewal premium varies as the policyholder gets older.         
	The premium of health insurance plans of life insurance companies remains the same for three or five years and vary from plan to plan.         
	Under the new guidelines issued by the Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority (IRDA), the policy term and the sum assured limit of these plans will be determined on a file and use basis, that is as proposed (in the product prospectus) and approved (by the regulator).        
	It would be mandatory for life and non-life insurance companies to enter into agreements before offering the new product to subscribers.        
	However, one life insurance company will be allowed to tie up with only one non-life insurance firm to offer the combo product.        
	It is envisaged that the proposed product class (will) enhance the penetration of personal lines of insurance business with a wider product choice to policyholders, IRDA said.        
	The IRDA notified the guidelines following representations by the insurance companies for an umbrella of single product to give more choice to a policy subscriber. The regulator has allowed combo products for micro insurance.         
	The combo products do help the policyholders and would help in increase the penetration of health insurance in the country, said S.B. Mathur, secretary-general of the Life Insurance Council.

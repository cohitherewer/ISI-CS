	Calcutta, Feb.19: Indian companies will spend less on information technology this year, according to a study by IT research and advisory firm Gartner.        
	The IT budget of domestic firms is likely to fall to 5.52 per cent in 2009 from 13 per cent last year, Gartner India research head Partha Iyengar said. The majority of this budget  up to 60 per cent  will be used to run day-to-day business operations. 23 per cent will be utilised to grow business and 19 per cent to transform it, he said.        
	Gartner surveyed 1,527 chief information officers (CIOs) from September 15 to December 15 on their budget plans. The study said CIOs in India had shifted focus from investing in emerging technologies to maximising returns on existing investments.        
	Business intelligence applications and information consolidation will get priority this year. This will enhance enterprise visibility and transparency in sales and operational performance.         
	CIOs are more likely to invest in ERP technologies, server and storage technologies to meet the demand.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Oil cop, CAG at odds 
                                                                                                               Oil cop, CAG at odds 
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Aug. 8: The Comptroller and Auditor Generals office has not audited or certified Reliances Rs 45,000-crore investments in the KG basin gasfields.        
	The CAG said it was supposed to audit the governments gas contract with Mukesh Ambanis RIL, but had not been able to access the books of the contractor for about two years.        
	We have been seeking the third party (RIL) account books from the petroleum ministry for more than a year and a half now ... it has not yet come, CAG officials told The Telegraph.        
	We believe the petroleum ministry has forwarded our requests but have not been successful in obtaining the records, they said.         
	This statement contradicts an earlier comment by V.K. Sibal, director-general of hydrocarbon, that the CAG had cleared RILs investments in KG Basin.         
	NTPC stand         
	NTPC will fight for its contracted price of $2.34 per mmBtu of gas from RILs KG basin and if necessary seek the power ministrys help. It was reacting to oil minister Murli Deoras comment that NTPC might have to pay the government-approved price of $4.20 per mmBtu.        
	Oil ministry         
	The oil ministry had informed Prime Minister Manmohan Singh it was not favouring Mukesh Ambani in his ongoing tussle with younger brother Anil and it had moved Supreme Court only to protect its rights on natural gas.

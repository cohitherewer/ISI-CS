The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Retailers lose appetite for duty-free shops
                                                                                                               Retailers lose appetite for duty-free shops
          PIYA SINGH                          Rough patch                                  
	Mumbai, Feb. 3: Indian retailers who had bet heavily on duty-free retail shops are quietly cutting their losses and exiting the business.        
	Kishore Biyanis Future group, which had entered into a joint venture with UK-based aviation support company Alpha Airports to run duty-free shops at New Delhis Indira Gandhi International Airport, has walked out of the venture after about two years.        
	The group is silent on the revenues from duty-free retailing so far at New Delhi. It is likely to be way below the estimated Rs 1,700 crore that it expected to earn in three years.         
	We exited the joint venture for two reasons. First, the infrastructure at the airport did not support us. Second, as passenger traffic began to slow, there were concerns on the execution of the business plan, said Future group director Rakesh Biyani.        
	While Biyani has left duty-free retailing in the hands of Alpha Airports in New Delhi, there is trouble brewing in duty-free stores across other major cities. In Bangalore, duty-free retailing is under a cloud as litigation has broken out over the tenders awarded to operate these stores at the citys international airport.        
	The Nuance group-Shoppers Stop combine won the duty free contract for the Bangalore International Airport in March 2008. A private duty-free operator has pointed out that the tendering process is faulty and the matter is in the Karnataka high court. Industry sources said a fresh tender could be floated for duty-free retail outlets at the international airport.        
	Nuance India Pvt Ltd CEO Shiv Kumar refused to comment on the status of its duty-free retail store in Bangalore saying, The matter is sub judice.        
	There are unconfirmed reports that Shoppers Stop might opt out of the Hyderabad airport where it runs a store with Nuance. Shiv Kumar, however, denied this. Both partners have a long-term outlook on this partnership, he added.         
	He, however, admitted that margins were under pressure.        
	Retailers have been complaining about the high rentals at airports, dwindling traffic and fewer footfalls at Indian duty-free stores.         
	Profitability is always a challenge in high cost environments like airports but revenues are a function of being able to offer the travelling consumer a retail experience which is on a par with international standards, Shiv Kumar said.        
	Duty-free retailing has pretty much been a non-starter in India with government-run shops stocking old perfumes and stale cigarettes that failed to attract customers. Consumer spends in India at duty free have been estimated at a few hundred rupees per flier.        
	The privatisation of Indian airports and the entry of private operators changed that scenario. Indian retailers, however, already seem to have had their fill. It is now up to the global operators to stick it out for the long haul.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Larsen gears up to raise $600m 
                                                                                                               Larsen gears up to raise $600m 
          PIYA SINGH                                            
	Mumbai, Aug. 2: Larsen amp; Toubro, the Rs 35,000-crore engineering giant, is likely to raise up to $600 million through a qualified institutional placement (QIP).        
	In a notice to the shareholders ahead of the companys annual general meeting on August 28, the management has said it will be seeking approval through a special resolution to raise $600 million, or Rs 2,400 crore, which will include a greenshoe option.         
	A qualified institutional placement allows companies to raise equity through shares or convertible debentures from institutions.         
	The price fixed for the QIP is not less than the average of the weekly high and low of the closing price of the scrip in the preceding two weeks before the management proposes to open the issue.        
	The stock markets have been abuzz with talks of a proposed QIP or a global depository receipts (GDR) issue from L amp;T. However, no confirmation was available yet.        
	The notice further states that the L amp;T shareholders have passed a special resolution for a QIP issue at its meeting held on August 29, 2008.         
	While that resolution was valid for 12 months, the company could not come out with the issue because of unfavourable market conditions.        
	This resolution will extend the validity of the QIP option by another 12 months, subject to shareholders approval.        
	However, details are not available on the exact price and timing of the issue.         
	The QIP proceeds will be used to provide capital to meet the expansion needs of L amp;T.         
	Recently, the companys subsidiary, L amp;T Finance, announced plans to raise Rs 1,000 crore through a non-convertible debenture (NCD) issue. The NCDs with a face value of Rs 1,000 will aggregate to Rs 500 crore with an option to retain over-subscription for another Rs 500 crore.         
	The proceeds will be used to meet L amp;T Finances capital expenditure and working capital needs. The NCDs will be listed on the National Stock Exchange.        
	Economical option        
	Recently, several Indian companies have opted for QIPs to raise funds since this route is economical and quick.         
	The response to QIPs so far has been mixed as it depends on how buoyant the stock markets are in the weeks before the company launches the issue.         
	Some estimates indicate that corporate India is ready to raise QIPs of nearly $20 billion as promoters are keen to raise funds when the markets are bullish.        
	Market sources, however, said QIPs were no longer the flavour of the season and many Indian companies that were aiming to raise large amount of fund were opting for GDR issues.         
	Several Indian companies, including Sterlite Industries, Suzlon Energy, Tata Steel and Tata Power, have recently closed GDRs and raised over $2 billion.         
	Firms seem to prefer GDRs even though QIPs are cheaper as they offer access to a larger number of institutional investors.

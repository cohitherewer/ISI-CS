	Calcutta, April 17: Swedish commercial vehicles major Volvo is eyeing about 25 per cent increase in bus sales this year. The company is banking on institutional purchases, especially orders from states.         
	The market is affected badly due to the current economic scenario. Business is coming mainly from institutional purchase and the state government orders under the Jawaharlal Nehru National Urban Renewal Mission (JNNURM), managing director of Volvo Buses India, Akash Passey, said.         
	The company sold 450 buses last year registering 100 per cent growth. Volvo is targeting a bigger pie of the city transport segment with low-floor air-conditioned buses.         
	Volvo  which has already captured the city-bus markets in Bangalore, Chennai, Pune, Hyderabad and Mysore  plans to enter the cities in the north and the east, including Calcutta.        
	Under JNNURM, the Centre will fund buses for 63 cities to improve urban transport. Passey said Volvo expected to make a dent with its low-floor AC buses. Volvo buses have a higher life cycle than others.         
	Already we have a couple of hundred orders from the state governments. We are also in talks with three private transport operators in Bengal besides the state government, he said.

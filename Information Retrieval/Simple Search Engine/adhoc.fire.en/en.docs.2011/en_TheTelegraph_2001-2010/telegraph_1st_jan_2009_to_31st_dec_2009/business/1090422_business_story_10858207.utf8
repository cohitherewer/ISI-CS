	New Delhi, April 21: The information technology industry may miss its export target of $60 billion for 2010 and only reach the figure three to four quarters after the deadline, according to Nasscom.        
	The aspiration for 2010 is at risk since an unprecedented slowdown is expected in key markets overseas (the US and Europe). A delay of at least three to four quarters is anticipated before we reach the 2010 target of $60 billion in exports, Som Mittal, president of Nasscom, said.        
	We expect the next few quarters to be extremely challenging with companies doing everything required to effectively overcome the challenges, he said.        
	Mittal said, As we continue to address the present situation, we also need to stay focused on the opportunities being created. Indias value proposition remains strong for sustained long-term growth.        
	However, a McKinsey report on the outlook for the industry said earnings could touch $225 billion in another 11 years.        
	Outlining the challenges ahead for the industry, Noshir Kaka, director of McKinsey, said, The industry has the potential to generate revenues of $225 billion in 2020, but this also can be at risk if certain problems are not tackled soon.        
	The report Perspective 2020: Transform Business, Transform India, based on research conducted over a year by McKinsey, outlines the road map for the Indian technology and business services industry.        
	Of the $225 billion, $175 billion is expected from exports and the remaining from domestic sources, it said.        
	Mittal said, Eighty per cent of the incremental revenue growth by 2020 will be driven by opportunities outside the current core markets, verticals and customer segments and the industry needs to redefine its value proposition to capture these.

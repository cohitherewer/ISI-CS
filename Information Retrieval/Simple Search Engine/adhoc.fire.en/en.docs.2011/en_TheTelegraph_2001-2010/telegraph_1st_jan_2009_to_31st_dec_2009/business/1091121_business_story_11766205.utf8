          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Rajnikant Patel in Calcutta on Friday. A Telegraph picture                                  
	Calcutta, Nov. 20: Reliance Exchange Next  a wholly owned subsidiary of Anil Ambani-controlled Reliance Capital Ltd  is planning a national spot exchange for commodities before entering the commodity futures exchange business.        
	Reliance Exchange Next CEO Rajnikant Patel said, The proposed uniform goods and services tax will help in our endeavour to create a robust national spot exchange for commodity trading.         
	At present, spot markets for commodities are very localised (mandis) and hence prices vary widely from one location to another. There is no mechanism for price discovery.         
	Patel was speaking on the sidelines of a seminar organised by the Indian Chamber of Commerce here today,        
	In equity markets, trading in derivatives such as futures and options contracts was allowed in a well developed spot market. In commodities markets, the reverse has happened  futures markets were allowed though there was no developed spot markets.                                 
	Reliance Spot Exchange started in October with trading in steel ingots. We have recently launched trading in pepper, Patel said.         
	Trading is done through e-auction and memberships are by invitation.         
	Currently, we are trading 10-15 tonnes of steel per day, Patel said.        
	The company is also planning to launch an equity exchange. We shall consider this at an appropriate time, Patel said.        
	These exchanges will be set up as different companies, which will be subsidiaries to the holding company, Reliance Exchange Next, he said.        
	According to sources in Reliance Capital, the company has plans to enter the stock and commodity exchange business by 2012.        
	At present, our focus is solely on the spot exchange business, he said.         
	Earlier, the Anil Dhirubhai Ambani group wanted to acquire 26 per cent in the National Multi-Commodity Exchange but received permission for a 10 per cent stake only.

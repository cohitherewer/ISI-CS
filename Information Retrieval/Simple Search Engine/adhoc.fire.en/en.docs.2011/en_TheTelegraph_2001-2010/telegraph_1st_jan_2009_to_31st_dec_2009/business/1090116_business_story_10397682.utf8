          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Tata Consultancy Services CEO S. Ramadorai (right) with chief operating officer N. Chandrasekaran in Mumbai on Thursday. (Reuters)                                  
	Mumbai, Jan. 15: Tata Consultancy Services, the countrys largest IT service provider, today failed to meet analyst expectations when it reported a 2.67 per cent growth rate in net profits for the third quarter ended December 31, 2008.         
	Net profits of the company rose to Rs 1,362.06 crore compared with Rs 1,326.67 crore in the same period last year. Analysts had expected TCS to post a net profit of over Rs 1,400 crore.         
	On Tuesday, Infosys had reported a 33 per cent rise in profits that beat the Streets expectations. TCS reported revenues of Rs 7,277.04 crore during the quarter, a 24.13 per cent growth rate over the level of Rs 5,862.65 crore in the corresponding quarter last year. The company posted a foreign exchange loss of Rs 250.59 crore.        
	TCS said in terms of markets, North America was stabilising and the company added two new customers during the quarter. Further, its strong European presence helped the company significantly grow its revenues in a sluggish market. On the other hand, despite the weak economic outlook, Latin America registered strong demand both from local and multinational companies.        
	However, the Indian market continued to see low capital spend by both public and private sector clients. TCS expects government spending to revive demand.        
	In tough market conditions, TCS continues to perform in a stellar fashion, driving revenue growth through our diversified market presence and boosting our operational profitability by conserving costs and creating efficiencies, said S. Ramadorai, chief executive officer and managing director of TCS.        
	During the third quarter, there was a gross addition of 11,733 employees of which 8,704 were trainees and 1,696 were lateral recruits in India and 1,373 employees were added in overseas subsidiaries and branches. The total employee base was 130,343 professionals.        
	According to TCS, the utilisation rate (excluding trainees) was 79.9 per cent and the attrition rate dropped to 11.9 per cent overall with an 11.2 per cent attrition rate in the IT services business and 20.5 per cent in the BPO segment.

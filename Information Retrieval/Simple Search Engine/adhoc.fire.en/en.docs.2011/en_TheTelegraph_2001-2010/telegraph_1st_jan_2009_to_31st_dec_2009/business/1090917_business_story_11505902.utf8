The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | DPSC plans 500mw unit in Bengal
                                                                                                               DPSC plans 500mw unit in Bengal
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Calcutta, Sept. 16: Power generator DPSC plans to build a 500-mega-watt plant in Bengal. The company has earmarked an investment of Rs 2,200 crore for the project, which will come up in two phases in Burdwan.        
	S. Radhakrishnan, managing director of DPSC, said the company had applied for water, coal linkages and environmental clearance.        
	It would require about 225 acres, half of which is with the company at its existing plant.        
	Contiguous land is available near our plant. We have to purchase it from private parties or take it on lease from Coal India or the state government, depending on who the owner is, he said.        
	Without the land, it would be difficult to get allocation of coal or water.        
	DPSC, which is a subsidiary of Andrew Yule, is up for divestment. Radhakrishnan said the financial closure of the new project would depend on the sale process initiated by Yule by putting its stake on the block.

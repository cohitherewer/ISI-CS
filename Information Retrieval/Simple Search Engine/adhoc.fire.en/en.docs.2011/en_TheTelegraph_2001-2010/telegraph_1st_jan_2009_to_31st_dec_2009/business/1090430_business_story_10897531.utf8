The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Pension option rules in place
                                                                                                               Pension option rules in place
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                                            
	New Delhi, April 29: The pension regulator today announced the final guidelines for a new scheme that gives citizens the option to invest half of the corpus in an equity index scheme.        
	According to the final guidelines, the regulator has allowed investment in index funds that replicate the portfolio of a particular index such as the BSE sensitive index or the NSE Nifty 50 index.        
	The regulator has classified investments under three categories  E, G and C  from which subscribers can choose their portfolio.         
	The asset class E indicates high return and high risk and it will be done through equity participation in index fund.        
	Under the G asset class, the regulator has restricted investments to central and state government bonds, while banks fixed deposit schemes and mutual fund investment, suggested by the Deepak Parekh panel, have been rejected.         
	In case of asset class C, the investment should be made in liquid funds of asset management companies, fixed deposit schemes of banks and debt securities.         
	In case of a chosen option, the investment would be made according to the choice but in case of auto choice investment, exposure would vary with age.        
	The New Pension Scheme was to be launched in April. It got delayed as the Election Commission, which has the right to stop any public pronouncements of policies that can influence the ongoing polls, is yet to give its approval.         
	The plan was to extend a defined pension scheme available to civil servants to workers in organised and unorganised firms. However, the difference is that for civil servants, the riskiest pension plan is one where a mere 5 per cent of their pension fund can be invested in the stock market.         
	The other difference, officials said, was that the schemes default offer was an auto choice option under which fund managers could change the debt-equity investment mix, depending on the age profile of the subscriber.        
	The option will come into play if an investor does not provide his or her preferred investment mix. Under this, the younger the subscriber, the higher will be the amount invested in equity.        
	Debt investment will rise as the subscriber gets older. This is to protect the aging subscriber from market uncertainties.        
	The default option, finalised by the pension regulator, provides that those who do not choose a specific pension plan, will be placed under a plan that will invest 50 per cent in equities, 20 per cent in government bonds and the rest in corporate bonds. This option will remain valid till the age of 35 after which the investment will change in favour of safer gilt and debt.

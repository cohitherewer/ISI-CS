The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Growth gloom deepens
                                                                                                               Growth gloom deepens
          JAYANTA ROY CHOWDHURY AMP; R.SURYAMURTHY                                             
	New Delhi, March 18: A 7 per cent growth during the current financial year seems unlikely to be achieved with experts confirming a worsening of the slowdown.        
	What is disturbing is that most of the experts are apprehending that the gloom will continue and may even deepen during the next financial year.        
	The governments chief statistician, Pronab Sen, made it clear that slowing industry and service could ensure that 7.1 per cent growth during 2008-09 is not achievable.         
	The International Monetary Fund (IMF) said today that growth would be 6.25 per cent. For the next fiscal, the IMF and brokerage CLSA came up with alarming forecasts of 5.25 per cent and 4.6 per cent, respectively. CLSA, however, said growth would pick up in 2010-11 and reach 6.5 per cent .        
	Planning Commission member Abhijit Sen said, We do expect a slowdown in the next financial year. In the worst-case scenario, the economy may grow a minimum 5 per cent and stimulus measures may add another 1.5 to 2 per cent.        
	Last month, RBI governor Duvvuri Subbarao had said the moderation might be steeper and more extended than earlier projected.        
	The government had earlier projected that 2008-09 growth would be 7 per cent.        
	Pronab Sen said after growing 5.3 per cent in the third quarter, the economy needed to expand 7.4 per cent in the fourth to reach the 7.1 per cent target for the fiscal. He said that this does not seem to be possible.        
	Arvind Virmani, the chief economic adviser to the finance minister, said if agriculture fared well then it was possible to reach the target.        
	However, he said, if agriculture growth is below 2.6 per cent then our forecast would have to be adjusted. Farms were one of the worst performers in the third quarter, expanding by just 2.2 per cent.        
	In the next budget, the finance ministry favours a fillip to infrastructure, more jobs and demand in core industries such as steel and cement, and deeper tax cuts.         
	Creating jobs and creating demand. These will be the two priorities of the new government and the bureaucracy and planners will be working out sets of possible policies to achieve that, said top officials.        
	However, the huge spending plans will be constrained by the governments fiscal deficit which is projected at 5.5 per cent in 2009-10.        
	Officials said a monetary stimulus would have to go hand in hand with fiscal measures. The Reserve Bank is expected to come up with further cuts in its key overnight policy rates.        
	The global recession has taken a toll on Indias exports, which have been falling since October.         
	As much as 5 lakh jobs have disappeared in textiles, gems, jewellery, handicraft and light engineering.        
	Though exports make up 20 per cent of production, the global recession had dampened the mood among India consumers.         
	IMF on inflation        
	IMF expects inflation to hover around 2 per cent during 2009-10, mainly on account of declining commodity prices and weakening demand resulting from economic slowdown.         
	With commodity prices waning and demand slackening, inflation is expected to fall further to 3 per cent by March 2009 and to 2 per cent on average in 2009-10.         
	Inflation has already dipped to 2.43 per cent for the week ended March 1, 2009, much ahead of the funds month-end projection of 3 per cent.

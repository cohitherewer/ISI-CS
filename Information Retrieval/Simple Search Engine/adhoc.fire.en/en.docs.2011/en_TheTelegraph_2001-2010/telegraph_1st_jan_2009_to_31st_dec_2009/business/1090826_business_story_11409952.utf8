                                                                                                               Govt vows gas mask for NTPC 
   Bid to limit impact of court ruling          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                                  
	New Delhi, Aug. 25: State-owned power utility National Thermal Power Corporation Ltd will not have to worry about the ramifications of the Supreme Court ruling in the Ambani gas dispute.        
	The government has decided to protect the interests of NTPC by moving an application before the Supreme Court later this week which will insist that the courts decision should not prejudice the PSUs case against Mukesh Ambani-owned Reliance Industries Ltd.        
	A panel headed by finance minister Pranab Mukherjee today decided to clarify before the apex court that the government-mandated price of $4.20 per million British thermal unit (mBtu) for RILs KG-D6 gas would not compromise NTPCs claims to gas at $2.34 per mBtu  a price that RIL had committed in 2004.        
	The interlocutory application will clarify that NTPCs case against RIL is different from the dispute between RIL and Anil Ambanis Reliance Natural Resources Ltd. The government will insist that the price for gas supplies to NTPC has been obtained at arms length through a global bidding process.         
	However, RNRLs claim to gas at the same price was based on a private family agreement and was, therefore, not at arms length.        
	As a result of the fresh application by the government, NTPC will no longer seek to become a party to the case before the Supreme Court  which at one stage had seemed a distinct possibility.        
	After todays meeting, law minister Veerappa Moily said the NTPC issue had been sorted out and the group of ministers would not hold further talks on the gas dispute.        
	Moily said the petroleum ministry would, if required, file amendments to the special leave application that the government had placed before the Supreme Court.        
	The ball is now before the Supreme Court, Moily said. The case comes up for hearing on September 1.        
	NTPC and RIL are battling before Bombay High Court over the pricing terms for the supply of 12 million cubic metres of gas per day for a period of 17 years. The state-owned power utility is insisting that RIL should supply the gas at $2.34 per mBtu  a price that the Mukesh Ambani-owned company had bid in response to the global tender. RIL insists that it has never signed a firm contract.         
	Moreover, the government had not approved the price.

                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      GST rollout date to be fixed at January meet
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Calcutta, Dec. 25: A date for the commencement of the goods and service tax regime, which seeks to radically overhaul the countrys indirect tax structure, is likely to be announced on January 8.        
	There will be a joint statement after a meeting with Union finance minister Pranab Mukherjee on January 8 on GST rollout, Asim Dasgupta, chairman of the state finance ministers panel on GST and Bengal finance minister, said here today. He was speaking on the sidelines of the 23rd industrial trade fair, which is organised by the Bengal National Chamber of Commerce and Industry.        
	State finance ministers will meet on January 7 and January 8 in Delhi to review the progress, and after a meeting with Mukherjee, they would be in a position to announce the launch date. However, Dasgupta did not give further details on the schedule of the rollout.        
	GST, which will do away with most of the indirect tax levies such as excise duty at the Centre and VAT at the state level, is slated to be introduced on April 1.        
	However, there are apprehensions that its introduction could be delayed. States such as Madhya Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Gujarat and Rajasthan are demanding that the introduction of GST be postponed as there is no consensus on the rates.        
	Asked whether a consensus with all the states had been arrived at, Dasgupta did not make any comments. He said progress had been made, which would make it possible to introduce GST at the appropriate time.        
	Mukherjee himself said yesterday that the Centre might miss the April 1 deadline because of a lack of consensus among the 28 states.        
	Citing a lack of preparedness, a task force constituted by the 13th Finance Commission had recently said the implementation of GST should be postponed by six months.        
	Earlier this month, Dasgupta had said GST would have four slabs. The rate would be zero for exempted items, one standard rate for majority of the goods and services and another having a moderate rate. Precious metals were likely to continue to attract 1 per cent.        
	Price rise        
	Dasgupta said a relaxed essential commodities act and forward trading had led to the rise in prices of commodities. During the NDA regime... there was a complete relaxation of the Essential Commodities Act. We are trying to bring that in order, he said.

	New Delhi, Sept. 16: Japanese two-wheeler maker Yamaha is keen to enter the automatic scooter market in India.        
	India has a 1.2-million units a year scooter market ... it has a huge potential. So, we are looking to enter the space. We will launch a scooter sometime soon, Yukimine Tsuji, CEO of India Yamaha Motors, told The Telegraph.        
	While Tsuji refused to give a deadline for launching the scooter, company sources said it should roll out its first model in the next two years.        
	Mahindra amp; Mahindra recently expanded its portfolio by launching two gearless scooters  Rodeo and Duro.        
	These are the first indigenously developed products of the company after it took over the assets of Pune-based Kinetic Motors in July last year.        
	Export target        
	Yamaha also plans to double the export of bikes from India to 1.4 lakh units by 2010, while stepping up efforts to increase domestic sales and introduce new models.        
	The company today launched its iconic superbike, the VMAX, sporting a 1679cc engine. The bike has been priced at Rs 20 lakh (ex-showroom Delhi) and will enhance the companys position in the high-end segment.        
	We are confident of exporting 70,000 bikes this year and doubling it to 1.4 lakh units by 2010, said Tsuji.         
	In 2008, the company had exported 40,000 units from India, which is Yamahas only hub globally for its 150cc models. Bikes in the 150cc range include Fazer, FZ-6, FZ16 and YZF-R15.        
	Tsuji said exports had fallen in 2008 and the first half of this year because of recession. In 2007, exports stood at 50,000 units.         
	Now, we are confident of a bounce-back, specially in the 150cc and above capacity, said Tsuji.        
	In India, the company plans to launch two models a year as it aims for a 10 per cent market share by 2012.        
	Motorcycle sales in the country in 2008-09 stood at 58,35,145 units. Yamahas share was 3.5 per cent in 2008.         
	Tsuji said Yamaha was also looking to sell 2.2-2.5 lakh units this year and 3 lakh units by 2010.

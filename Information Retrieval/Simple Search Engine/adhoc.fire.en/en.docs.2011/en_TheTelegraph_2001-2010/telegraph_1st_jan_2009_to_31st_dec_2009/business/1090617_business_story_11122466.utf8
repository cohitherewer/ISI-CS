          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, June 16: State-run oil firms are losing about Rs 135 crore a day for selling petroleum products below costs and have sought support from the government.         
	Already, the higher cost of crude oil in the world markets has forced private retailer Essar Oil to hike petrol and diesel prices. An official of the Mumbai-based firm said it had raised diesel prices by Rs 1-2 a litre and petrol prices by Rs 1-2.5 a litre, depending on the location of the petrol pump. The company operates 1,233 outlets.        
	However, Reliance Industries, which sells diesel from some outlets, has not revised prices. We would like to wait for some more time before taking a call, a company official said.        
	Indian Oil Corporation, Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Ltd and Bharat Petroleum Corporation Ltd are selling a litre of diesel at Rs 30.86 and petrol at Rs 40.62 a litre in Delhi.        
	The PSU oil firms are mounting pressure on the government to review prices as they stand to lose Rs 38,700 crore in this fiscal. The firms are making a loss of Rs 2.96 a litre on diesel, Rs 6.08 a litre on petrol, Rs 12.65 a litre on kerosene and Rs 62.49 on every LPG cylinder.        
	Petroleum minister Murli Deora said the government was concerned about rising global crude oil prices and was exploring various options, including an increase in retail prices to minimise their impact.        
	Crude oil had touched a low of $32.40 per barrel in December after peaking at $142 a barrel in July last year. When the prices of petrol, diesel and LPG were reduced last January, crude was averaging $42.12 a barrel.

          OUR CORRESPONDENT                          Salman Khursheed in New Delhi on Monday. (PTI)                                  
	New Delhi, Nov. 30: The government today said it would come out with a corporate governance code by December-end.         
	The adoption of the code will be voluntary for one year, corporate affairs minister Salman Khursheed said.        
	We will come out with a comprehensive code on corporate governance by the third week of December. This will be kept voluntary for one year. We will see if the companies have any difficulties. Accordingly, we will take a decision to include, exclude or abandon certain portions, Khursheed said. The minister today released a report on corporate governance prepared by the Confederation of Indian Industry (CII).        
	The code has been prepared by a CII task force headed by former cabinet secretary Naresh Chandra. The report of the task force, formed after the Satyam scam, contains some voluntary recommendations. The recommendations outlined in this report are aimed at listed companies and their wholly owned subsidiaries, the CII said.        
	The report wants a nomination committee to pick independent directors. The committee should comprise a majority of independent directors, including the chairman.        
	The report also suggested that non-executive and independent directors should be paid in a manner not linked to the net profit of a company.         
	The Serious Fraud Investigation Office today filed a case against Ramalinga Raju and others in the Satyam case in a Hyderabad court, Khursheed said.                                                                                        
	The task force said a statutory or internal auditor has to confidentially disclose its net worth to the listed company appointing it.         
	Each member of the audit firm is liable to an unlimited extent unless they have formed a limited liability partnership firm or company for professional services, said CII.        
	Even in the case of a limited liability firm undertaking audit in the future, the individual auditor responsible for dereliction of duty shall have unlimited liability. The firm and its partners shall have limited liability to the extent of their paid-in capital and free or undistributed reserves, said the report.         
	In respect to letter of appointment to NEDs and independent directors, the task force said the letter should specify the expectation of the board from the appointed director, the fiduciary duties and the liabilities that accompany such a position.        
	The remuneration committee of a board is asked to have atleast three members, majority of whom should be independent directors.        
	The committee should set the remuneration of for all executive directors and the executive chairman, including any compensation payments, such as retiral benefits or stock options.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Bid to keep tabs on select FDI
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Bid to keep tabs on select FDI
          JAYANTA ROY CHOWDHURY                                          
	New Delhi, Dec. 20: The government is planning to monitor from the security standpoint operational FDI projects in sensitive segments such as telecom, oil and aviation and the border areas.        
	Till now, foreign investment scrutiny is only at the proposal stage, and the government is trying to strengthen the norms even further. However, the pro-reform ministries have been arguing for minimum checks on this count so as not to delay investment approvals.         
	Officials said there was also a need for monitoring when projects were up and running, particularly the movement of expatriates and technology.        
	Tabs need to be kept even on share transactions that lead to the transfer of ownership to entities, which make the government uncomfortable. By implication, screening of selective mergers and acquisitions involving huge sums of foreign investment can occur. In telecom, officials said, some 3G proposals can come under scrutiny, along with some 2G players.        
	These manoeuvres are the result of recommendations of the National Security Council, which has done a risk analysis of FDI in sensitive sectors and the border areas.         
	The NSC felt the sharing of hydrological, geological and seismic data of certain regions should not be done without prior vetting and clearance. Such data have relevance for the governments plan to sell oil and gas exploration blocks.        
	Officials said there were loopholes in travel documents, with foreign consultants often coming to the country on tourist and business visas and not work visas. These are among the issues which need attention and monitoring is part of that process.        
	Another area of concern is valuable data thrown up by mining and oil exploration activities, which are supposed to be processed within the country. Since the data are computerised, they can be transferred abroad through the Internet.        
	Officials also point to attempts to bring in telecom technologies and equipment by tainted suppliers who are associated with foreign intelligence or military agencies.         
	Recently, the government banned state-owned Bharat Sanchar Nigam Limited from buying equipment from Chinas Huawei, which, allegedly, has links to the Peoples Liberation Army.         
	Threat perception        
	Last year, the government had deliberated on a note discussing situations in the event of Indian industries falling into wrong hands.        
	Many issues were seen as possible threats such as shutting down or sabotaging a crucial facility, impeding a national security investigation and accessing sensitive data.        
	Other issues covered were the possibility of limiting Indian government access to information and denying critical technology to local entities. Besides, the note discussed unlawful transfer of technology abroad and the beefing up of intelligence capability of a foreign country.

                                                                                                               Glenmark arm to woo large investors
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Mumbai, Oct. 2: Glenmark Generics Ltd, a subsidiary of Glenmark Pharmaceuticals Ltd, is looking at a pre-IPO placement with institutional investors to raise up to Rs 100 crore.        
	The company had recently filed a draft red herring prospectus with Sebi for an initial public offering. The company is planning to raise Rs 575 crore.         
	If the pre-IPO placement sails through, the issue size of the proposed public offer will be reduced to the extent of such a placement.         
	At present, 35 per cent of an issue is reserved for retail investors.        
	In its prospectus, Glenmark Generics has said a portion of the funds raised from the issue will be invested in its wholly owned subsidiary, Glenmark Generics Finance SA, Switzerland (GGFSA).         
	The money will be used for part payment of a loan taken from group company Glenmark Holding SA (GHSA) under a share purchase agreement inked last year. GGFSA bought 215,600,000 shares of a GHSA subsidiary.        
	The plan is to utilise Rs 480 crore from the net proceeds of the issue to fund equity investment in GGFSA which will latter be used to repay the loan.        
	In 2007-08, Glenmark Pharmaceuticals had restructured its businesses into generics and specialty.         
	The generics and active pharmaceutical ingredients businesses were brought under Glenmark Generics.

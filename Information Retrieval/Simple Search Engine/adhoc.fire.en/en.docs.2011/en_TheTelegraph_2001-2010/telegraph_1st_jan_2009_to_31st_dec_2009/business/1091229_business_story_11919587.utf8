          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Anand Sharma in New Delhi on Monday. (AFP)                                  
	New Delhi, Dec. 28: Indias ambitious infrastructure project to develop economic hubs along the railway passage from Delhi to Mumbai took a big step forward with the signing of two agreements with Japan.        
	The first memorandum of understanding (MoU) was signed between the Delhi-Mumbai Industrial Corridor Development Corporation and the Japan External Trade Organisation for the development of modern townships along the passage.        
	The other pact was between India Infrastructure Finance Company Limited and the Japan Bank for International Cooperation for setting up a project development fund worth over Rs 1,000 crore for 24 industrial hubs.        
	A similar hub has been planned between Punjabs Ludhiana and Dankuni near Calcutta, for which the government is negotiating a loan with the World Bank.        
	The new township, which would come up on this (Delhi-Mumbai) corridor, will help the large populations that move to this region. This project will help us in the faster movement of goods through the corridor and will generate employment, infrastructure and have a huge multiplier effect for wealth generation, said commerce minister Anand Sharma after the two sides signed the deals.        
	The pact between the two countries is a confirmation of the political will of both countries to take forward our bilateral co-operation and to further consolidate our relationship, he said.        
	Sources said Japans investment in the Delhi-Mumbai hubs, or industrial corridor, would be around $10 billion, spread over five years.        
	The industrial corridor will be built on either side of a freight corridor, also being supported by Japan. This is aligned along roughly the existing rail tracks  it begins at Tughlakabad and Dadri in the National Capital Region and ends at the Jawaharlal Nehru port in Navi Mumbai, passing through Haryana, Rajasthan, Gujarat and parts of Maharashtra.        
	The freight corridor is estimated to cost Rs 26,000 crore.        
	The industrial corridor will have several supporting infrastructure projects such as power facilities and rail connectivity to ports. It will also cover the development of ports on the west coast.         
	Along this corridor, several industrial estates, special economic zones and clusters with high quality infrastructure are proposed to be developed to attract more investments, including from Japan.        
	The 24 hubs, which will utilise the money in the Project Development Fund, will consist of 13 investment regions and 11 industrial regions.        
	Nuclear tech        
	Japan today offered nuclear technology to India, with whom it aims to achieve $20 billion worth of trade within a year.         
	Japanese Prime Minister Yukio Hatoyama met Ratan Tata and Mukesh Ambani, and discussed ways to take bilateral trade and investment to the next level.                     
	 Bilateral trade was worth $13 billion in 2008.

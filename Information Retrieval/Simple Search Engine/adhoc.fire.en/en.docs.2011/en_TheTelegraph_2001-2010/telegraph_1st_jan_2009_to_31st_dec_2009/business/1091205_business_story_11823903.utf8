The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Corus mothballs steel plant
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Corus mothballs steel plant
          AMIT ROY                                    
	London, Dec. 4: Ratan Tata and his colleagues at Tata Steel have a moral and social obligation to rescue Teesside steel workers, union leaders said today, after Indian-owned Corus Steel announced it was mothballing its Redcar plants with the loss of 1,700 jobs.        
	Corus says the international consortium, which was taking 80 per cent of the slabs manufactured at Redcar, pulled out of a legally binding 10-year purchase agreement the moment the steel price dropped.        
	The Corus facilities on Teesside turn iron ore into steel slabs, which are typically 6-12 metres in length and have a cross-section of 250mm by 2 metres.         
	The slabs constitute the raw material that go into the rolling mills to be made into tubes and a wide range of steel goods.        
	Corus is furious with the consortium which made profits amounting to $800 million when times were good but allegedly turned its back on Redcar the moment recession hit the steel industry.        
	Although Corus is emphasising it is mothballing its Redcar facilities and not closing them down permanently, no one thinks the jobs will come back in the foreseeable future.        
	Communities which have grown up around steel plants in the north of England have traditionally been close knit so that todays announcement is considered nothing short of devastating.         
	Any suggestion that the jobs could be rescued by exporting the slabs to Tata Steel factories in India were dismissed as wholly impractical. The made-in-England slabs are surplus to requirement since Tata Steel has quite enough of them back in India.        
	Given the troubles of Jaguar Land Rover and the prolonged dip in car sales, the last 12 months have not been easy for Tatas British acquisitions.         
	Unites joint general secretary, Derek Simpson, said todays news was absolutely devastating. This is a dark day for British manufacturing.        
	Keith Hazlewood, national officer of the GMB union, reflected public anger that bankers, even in banks rescued by taxpayers, want to be paid bonuses this Christmas.                                                                                                                     
	What a terrible contrast between the 1,700 workers losing their jobs on Teesside and the multimillionaire bankers continuing to gorge themselves at the expense of the taxpayers.        
	 Redcars Labour MP Vera Baird declared: This is a gut-wrenching disappointment after all the effort and the hopes won by the sheer doggedness of our workers at Corus since the consortium left last April. My heart is with those people getting this abysmal news three weeks before Christmas.        
	Fiona Hall, Liberal Democrat MEP for the North East, agreed. This is a major blow for Teesside which will have a huge knock-on effect on the regions economy.        
	 Todays Corus announcement began by pinning the blame on the buyers. The companies in the consortium were named as Marcegaglia SpA, Dongkuk Steel Mills Co Ltd, Duferco Participations Holding Ltd (through Steel Invest Trading SA) and Alvory SA (a wholly owned subsidiary of Ternium SA).        
	 An international consortiums breaking of a binding contract has led Corus to partially implement the proposal announced in May 2009 of mothballing some of the facilities belonging to the Teesside Cast Products (TCP) business in northeast England, it said.        
	 It went on: TCPs Redcar Blast Furnace, Lackenby steelmaking and the South Bank Coke Ovens will be mothballed at the end of January 2010. Corus will continue to have a substantial presence in the Teesside area, employing more than 2,000 people at operations in Hartlepool, Skinningrove, the Teesside Beam Mill and Teesside Technology Centre.        
	 Kirby Adams, the chief executive of Corus, said: We are acutely aware that this will be devastating news for our employees, our contractors, their families and the local community. I am personally very sad we have reached this point. I did not join Corus to close plants.        
	 Prime Minister Gordon Browns spokesman told reporters at a regular Westminster briefing: This is a disappointing announcement. We know that Corus were trying to find a long-term solution to the difficulties they flagged up earlier this year. We all know the steel industry has suffered really difficult times during the global recession. We have worked hard with all parties since the cancellation of a main supply contract in May and we are very aware that Corus management have worked very hard to try to keep the plant open.        
	 Lord Swraj Paul, chairman of the Caparo steel group, who believes Browns electoral prospects are improving, told The Telegraph: My personal view is that steel will have a difficult time for the next two years.

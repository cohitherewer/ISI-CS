	Calcutta, Dec. 21: Tata Steel managing director Hemant Nerurkar today said vested interests had held up the companys proposed steel plant at Kalinganagar in Orissa.         
	The company plans to build a 6-million-tonne facility on 3,500 acres, but the project is yet to take off because of resistance from the local people.        
	Nerurkar compared Kalinganagar with the failed Nano project of the Tatas at Singur in Bengal.         
	According to the Tata Steel boss, politics was behind the refusal of the companys compensation package by some Kalinganagar families.        
	There is a hint of politics. As it was with Singur here, Nerurkar said at the CII national conference on leadership in Calcutta.        
	He called for political will at the government level to implement large greenfield projects.        
	Like the Tatas, several companies  Posco, ArcelorMittal, Reliance  are facing trouble in acquiring land for their projects.         
	Observers said Nerurkar could have referred to the extremists as the vested interests.        
	At Singur, Mamata Banerjee of the Trinamul Congress had laid siege to the Tata Motors plant that forced the company to shift the project to Sanand in Gujarat.         
	Many had then blamed Bengals Left Front government for not showing enough political will against Mamata.        
	However, Nerurkar did not put the entire blame on political parties and governments.         
	He said companies must sharpen their skills to build confidence among the people. Sometimes people like us who live in the cities do not understand the psyche of the rural people, Nerurkar said.        
	In Kalinganagar, land with compensation was first acquired by the Orissa government in the early nineties.         
	However, the locals continued to occupy the plots.         
	Tata Steel was allotted the land in 2005, and in January 2006 six villagers protesting the project died in a police firing.        
	The company had since then set up an elaborate rehabilitation scheme named Tata Steel Pariwar.        
	Around 800 individuals have accepted the package offered by the Tatas and now live in a colony built by the company.        
	The Tatas provide schooling to children and medical help, apart from organising technical training and entrepreneurial development programmes.        
	Nerurkar said the quality of life provided by the company was better, but some 100 core families have not shifted.

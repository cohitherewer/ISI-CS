The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | World Bank ban on Wipro adds to gloom
                                                                                                               World Bank ban on Wipro adds to gloom
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                            
	Mumbai, Jan.12: Wipro Ltd today disclosed that the World Bank had in June 2007 barred it from bidding for any contracts up to 2011. This development comes after the Bangalore-based IT services company offered American depository shares to three World Bank employees in 2000.        
	The announcement sent Wipro shares crashing 9.6 per cent to Rs 226.60 on the BSE today. Though implications of the decision is not material on Wipros revenues, market circles questioned as to why the company did not disclose this fact earlier.        
	Wipro is not the lone Indian entity to have been debarred by the World Bank. A similar action has also been adopted for Megasoft. Earlier, Satyam Computer was barred for eight years for what the bank called providing improper benefits to its staff and failing to maintain documentation to support fees charged for its sub-contractors.        
	In a statement, World Bank said it had decided to make public the names of all companies that have been debarred from receiving direct contracts from the bank group under its corporate procurement programme and that this change was made in the interest of fairness and transparency.        
	It said Wipro Technologies, the global IT services business of Wipro, has been found ineligible as it provided improper benefits to its staff. As regards Megasoft Consultants, World Bank said the action beginning December 2007 had been taken as it had participated in a joint venture with the bank staff while also conducting business with the bank.        
	Delhi-based Nestor Pharmaceuticals and trading firm Gap International along with an individual Surendra Singh are the other Indian entities to be barred from working on World Bank projects for engaging in collusive practices for projects financed by the bank.        
	Wipro and Megasoft said the ban would have no effect on their earnings. However, analysts contended that investor confidence would be shaken and the companies needed to assuage their clients on their commitment towards transparent dealings.        
	A spokesperson for Wipro told The Telegraph from Bangalore that revenues from World Bank were insignificant and that business from the bank over the last eight years was less than $1 million. The spokesperson said the disclosure was made today as World Bank changed its disclosure norms yesterday, hinting that a clause with the World Bank prevented the company from making this fact public.        
	G.V. Kumar, managing director and CEO of Megasoft said, Megasoft has had no business from World Bank since 2004 and there is no financial impact on the company due to this announcement.

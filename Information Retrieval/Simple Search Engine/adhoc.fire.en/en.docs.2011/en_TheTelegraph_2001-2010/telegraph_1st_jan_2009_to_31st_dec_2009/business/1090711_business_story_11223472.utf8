          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      Yogesh Agarwal in Calcutta on Friday. A Telegraph picture                          
	Calcutta, July 10: Deposit and lending rates are likely to rise after September when the busy season kicks in, according to IDBI Bank chairman and managing director Yogesh Agarwal.        
	The third quarter of the current financial year may herald a change in the softer rate cycle and the cost of bank loans will go up, Agarwal said at a banking seminar organised by the eastern regional council of Ficci here today.        
	The third quarter being a busy season for economic activities, the demand for bank credit from retail as well as institutional customers generally rises. The supply of fund is likely to fall short of the aggregate credit demand from the government, retail customers and corporate houses, particularly in the infrastructure sector, and this may push up interest rates, he said.        
	In 2009-10, IDBI Bank is targeting an 18 per cent growth in credit against Rs 1,03,428 crore last year and a 20 per cent growth in deposits.        
	The bank is operating at a capital adequacy of 11.57 per cent that is above the stipulated 9 per cent but lower than the desirable 12 per cent. This explains why IDBI Bank is not being aggressive in increasing its portfolio of advances.                    
	When you talk of inclusive growth in the farm and SME sectors, someone will have to bear the cost of the subsidy burden, Agarwal said.               
	Though finance minister Pranab Mukherjee has assured that the government will not put the burden on the credit market, the impact of the huge fiscal deficit on interest rates remains a concern, according to the IDBI chief.                    
	However, neither the government nor the RBI has come out with any market borrowing plan. At the end of the first quarter of the current fiscal, banks are reporting around 20 per cent growth in credit.                                      
	 compared with the same period a year ago.                                                   
	The bank is operating at a capital adequacy of 11.57 per cent that is above the stipulated 9 per cent but lower than the desirable 12 per cent. This explains why IDBI Bank is not being aggressive in increasing its portfolio of advances.        
	We definitely need to raise tier I capital (which stood at 6.81 per cent at the end of March this year), though we still have a headroom to raise tier II capital to Rs 1,000 crore. We have approached the government with our capital-raising plan. The government owns a little more than 52 per cent in the bank. But we have not yet heard anything from the government, Agarwal said.        
	The bank is also planning to venture into private equity and has made an application with the Reserve Bank of India.         
	The RBI has allowed IDBI Bank to start the mutual fund business. The bank has market regulator Sebis permission for the venture but is not looking for a partner for the asset management business.                    
	He also added that bank interest rates in the country have often been seen in conjunction with rate of inflation. Corporations may argue that bank lending rates should come down because the wholesale price inflation has turned negative. For banks, deposit rates must come down first so that they can lower their lending rates. But the consumer price inflation is still above 9 per cent and bank deposit rates are already lower than this. How far you can lower the deposit rates? he explained.

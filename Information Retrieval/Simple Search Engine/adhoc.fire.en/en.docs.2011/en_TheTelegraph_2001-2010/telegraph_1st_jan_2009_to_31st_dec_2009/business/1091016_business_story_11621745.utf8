The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Ministers review gas case
                                                                                                               Ministers review gas case
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Oct. 15: Senior central ministers today took stock of the governments preparedness for the battle in the Supreme Court between the Ambani brothers over the price of gas from Reliance Industries fields in the Krishna-Godavari basin.        
	Though the court battle is between Mukesh Ambanis RIL and Anil Ambanis Reliance Natural Resources Limited, the government has filed a special leave petition to preserve the sanctity of its gas utilisation policy.        
	At the meeting, attended by finance minister Pranab Mukherjee, petroleum minister Murli Deora and law minister Veerappa Moily, it was decided to strengthen the governments legal team for the hearing which is slated to commence on Tuesday.        
	Sources said NTPC Ltd and the power ministrys point of view might be included in the governments application so that the entire government would be seen as speaking in the same voice.         
	Mukherjee wanted to know what was happening in the case and so the meeting was called. Whatever assistance is required will be given (to the legal team), petroleum minister Murli Deora said.         
	NTPC and the power ministrys point of view is that the case should not prejudice any judgment of Bombay High Court in the PSUs gas case with Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL). NTPC wants RIL to sell it gas from the KG basin at $2.34 per million British thermal unit (mBtu), which is being disputed by the Mukesh Ambani firm.        
	The panel of ministers also took stock of how the governments interest was being protected.         
	It was decided that not only should more government lawyers be brought in for the case but private counsel could also be chosen to work with additional solicitor general Mohan Parasaran. The government is even considering to field solicitor general Gopal Subramaniam.        
	Reliance Natural Resources Ltd had moved the Supreme Court for the speedy implementation of a Bombay High Court order that had asked Reliance to sell 28 million metric standard cubic metres of gas a day at $2.34 per mBtu for 17 years to RNRL.        
	While Harish Salve will fight for Reliance, Ram Jethmalani and Mukul Rohtagi will represent RNRL.        
	Last Sunday, Anil made a dramatic peace overture to his brother Mukesh.         
	I sincerely believe that Mukeshbhai and I can, even at this late stage, sort out all our disagreements, in a constructive, cordial and conciliatory manner, if we both commit to getting this done, Anil had said in a statement.

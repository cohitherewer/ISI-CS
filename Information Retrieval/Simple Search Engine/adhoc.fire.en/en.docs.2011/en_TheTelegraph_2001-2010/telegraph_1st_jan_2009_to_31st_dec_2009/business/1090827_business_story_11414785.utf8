The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | BP boost for infotech triumvirate
                                                                                                               BP boost for infotech triumvirate
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Mega offer                                  
	Mumbai, Aug. 26: The Big Boys of Indias infotech industry  Tata Consultancy Services, Infosys Technologies, and Wipro  along with IBM and Accenture of the US have together bagged a deal worth $1.5 billion from global oil giant BP.         
	None of the companies divulged the size of the mega deal or their share of the pie. However, analysts estimated that each of the Indian companies could expect to earn revenues of $100 million each from the BP deal that will have a five-year tenure.         
	IBM will get the lions share, estimated at anywhere between $500 million and $700 million.         
	Although the deal was announced after market hours, stocks of the three Indian IT companies had flared up during the day.         
	On the Bombay Stock Exchange, the Infosys share ended 4 per cent higher at Rs 2,182 while Wipro gained 2 per cent at Rs 556.10. The TCS scrip rose nearly 4 per cent to close at Rs 548.        
	The mega deal will buoy spirits at the infotech companies that had reported robust results in the first quarter ended June 30 but had given muted forecasts for the second quarter. The deal also comes amid signs of a recovery in the global economy.        
	Analysts said for a sector where a good part of the revenues came from the banking, financial services and insurance segment, the order would improve the prospects of non-traditional sectors such as energy.        
	The trend of farming out a large contract among multiple vendors is not new in the IT industry. In 2005, ABN Amro had awarded a five-year, $2.2-billion contract to IBM, Infosys and TCS  with IBM bagging the lions share.        
	TCS said it had been selected as a strategic IT vendor by BP. Sources close to the countrys largest IT services exporter said it would look into application development and maintenance at BP apart from innovating applications to manage the latters IT infrastructure.        
	TCS said it won the contract after BP undertook a rigorous selection process, which assessed it on the capability to deliver innovation for efficient management of applications, oil and gas sector knowledge and reduce cost through various methods.

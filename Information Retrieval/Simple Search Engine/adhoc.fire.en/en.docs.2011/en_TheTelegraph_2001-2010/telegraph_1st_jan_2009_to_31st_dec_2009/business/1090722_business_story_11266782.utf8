The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | ByCell plan gets second chance
                                                                                                               ByCell plan gets second chance
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, July 21: The Foreign Investment Promotion Board will reconsider ByCells proposal to launch mobile services in India in its meeting on Friday.        
	The Switzerland-based telecom player had appealed to the finance ministry against the revocation of an earlier FIPB approval of its plan.         
	Based on a request from the finance and telecom ministries, the FIPB decided to give ByCell a second chance.        
	The government had withdrawn the permission granted to ByCell for an investment of $500 million (Rs 2,566 crore) over a period of 3-5 years after the revenue department and the ministry of home affairs asked it to review the application on the grounds of security.         
	ByCell CEO Alexandre Louzine had written to the FIPB on May 9 offering to change its shareholding if necessary.

                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Asset assessment 
        On the threshold of a new decade, Srikumar Bondyopadhyay wonders what investors gained from assets in the year gone by                                            
	The first decade of the new millennium draws to a close. The decade was remarkable in its extremes. Financial markets rose to heights never seen before and it toppled over like a house of cards in no time at all. But alls well that ends well. The year 2009 was one of recovery, of crawling out of the debris left behind by the global financial crisis and start building anew.         
	Smart recovery        
	Prices of all asset classes recovered smartly in 2009 and there are encouraging news of economic recovery from all around.        
	If we take stock of how different asset classes have fared so far in 2009, equities emerge as the winner far ahead of other asset classes. Table B shows that Rs 1 lakh invested in equities in January this year would have amounted to anywhere between Rs 1,74,000 and Rs 1,88,000 by now, a return of 74 per cent to 88 per cent in less than a year!         
	Gold is good        
	In comparison, investments in gold generated only 29-30 per cent though gold price in the international markets scaled a new high of $1217.40 per troy ounce this month from a level of $850 at the beginning of the calendar year  an increase of more than 43 per cent.        
	The yellow metal yielded lower returns in the domestic market because the Indian rupee appreciated vis--vis the dollar from 52.06 a dollar in March to 46.76 as on December 24, an appreciation of more than 10 per cent.        
	Silvers better        
	Interestingly, silver fetched a far superior return  Rs 1 lakh invested in silver would have amounted to Rs 1,60,991.        
	Other ferrous and non-ferrous metals also yielded handsome returns during the year as is evident from the fact that the metal index on the Multi-Commodity Exchange surged 52.43 per cent between January 1 and December 24, 2009.         
	Crude cut        
	Even crude oil price in the international markets during the year rose 58.3 per cent to rule at $73,36 on December 18 at the New York Mercantile Exchange (Nymex). But because of the appreciation of the rupee against the dollar, investments in crude oil here have generated only a tad over 50 per cent.        
	Bonding well        
	The government and the Reserve Bank of India followed an easy monetary policy to stem economic slowdown. As a result, investments in bonds and debt papers yielded a good 22 per cent return in the face of a declining interest rate regime.         
	But now that the central bank is facing a dilemma with the rapid price inflation, particularly of food items, a squeeze in money supply as well as an interest rate hike is on the cards in early 2010. If interest rate and inflation increases in 2010, investment in debt/bonds will not be a lucrative proposition.        
	Realty trend        
	Real estate showed a mixed trend amid economic slowdown and credit crisis. Prices of residential properties in some cities rose significantly, while they declined in some other locations, according to the Residential Property Price Index (Residex) published by the National Housing Bank.         
	Property prices rose by nearly 40 per cent in Calcutta, but declined by more than 32 per cent in Hyderabad (see Table A). So, the return on real estate investment varied from city to city.        
	Asset boom        
	It is interesting to note that the price of all assets rose significantly in 2009, a phenomenon that is not quite usual.         
	Each asset class not only has a distinct risk-return profile, but the correlation of price movement also varies widely among various categories of assets.         
	Hence it is not common that price of all assets move simultaneously in the same direction.        
	So what did happen in 2009? After the fall of Lehman Brothers and the big economies went into recession, governments across the globe pumped in more than $7 trillion as bailout/stimulus packages. In the absence of sufficient credit offtake, this created excess liquidity that pushed up the prices of every asset class at the same time.         
	While a weakening US economy and greenback shattered peoples faith on the US currency and forced them to look for safe haven investments in gold and other precious metals, a growing reserves of foreign exchange in emerging economies also forced central banks there to diversify their forex assets into gold and this prompted more demand for the yellow metal.        
	As and when the US and other European countries start withdrawing their stimulus packages and increase interest rates, asset prices will head for a correction driven by an outflow of foreign investments that are now flowing into emerging markets.        
	End of decade        
	The year 2009 was also the last year of the first decade of the new millennium. An analysis of returns from investments in various asset classes during this decade reveals a slightly different picture than we have discussed so far.         
	Over the 10-year period, gold outsmarts equities in terms of returns. An amount of Rs 1 lakh invested in gold in January 2000 would have now amounted to Rs 3,70,387 compared with Rs 3,33,247 in case of the BSE sensex and Rs 3,66,159 for the BSE 500 index. Even silver trailed way behind gold in generating returns on investment (see Table C).

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Mobile call rates set to drop
                                                                                                               Mobile call rates set to drop
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                          Cell buzz                                  
	New Delhi, March 9: Charges on mobile calls may fall following the telecom regulators decision to reduce the termination fees for domestic calls.        
	The termination charge on domestic calls is now down to 20 paise per minute from 30 paise. The revised rates are from next month.        
	Termination fees are paid by an operator from whose network a call originates to an operator on whose network the call ends.         
	Termination fee constitutes a significant portion of mobile call charges. So, any reduction in it will lead to a direct fall in tariffs, said officials of the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai).         
	However, telecom companies said they would work out the new rates only after assessing the impact of the cut.         
	Only upon examining the cost implications will the industry be able to react to these revised charges, said T.V. Ramachandran, director-general of the Cellular Operators Association of India, which represents the interest of GSM mobile players.        
	Telecom minister A. Raja had earlier said a reduction in termination charges along with increased competition could lead to local call rates being as low as 10 paise per minute and STD 25-35 paise per minute by 2010.        
	Along with lower termination charges for domestic calls, Trai has raised the termination charge on calls made from abroad to 40 paise per minute from 30 paise.        
	The new rates will enable telecom companies such as Bharti Airtel, Vodafone Essar and Idea Cellular to earn Rs 5,000 crore annually.        
	We expect the service providers to pass on this benefit in the form of lower tariff for outgoing international calls, said Trai officials.        
	Before todays change, domestic players could not charge more than 30 paise a minute from foreign firms for calls made to India. However, foreign operators charge around Rs 3 per minute for Indian calls terminating in their country.        
	India gets 3 minutes of overseas calls for every minute of calls made abroad.The regulator said termination charges for third-generation (3G) voice calls would be the same as those for 2G calls.

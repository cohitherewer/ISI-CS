	New Delhi, Aug. 5: Cairn India is likely to begin crude production from its Rajasthan fields in the third week of this month.         
	It is the second major crude discovery in the country since Bombay High and is expected to cut Indias oil import bill by $6.8 billion, or 7 per cent, at peak production. The stake holders and the government are considering August 18 to 20 to formally commence production, industry sources said.         
	Cairn said the output would touch 30,000 barrels per day by the end of the third quarter of this fiscal and reach 175,000 bpd (8.75 million tonnes) in 2011. Cairn is working with the government to start production from the Mangala field in Rajasthan in August, officials said. According to Goldman Sachs, the peak output from the fields is likely to be 190,000 bpd.

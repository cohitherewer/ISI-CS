The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Sector caps to guide FDI in small units
                                                                                                               Sector caps to guide FDI in small units
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Sept. 4: Foreign investment in micro and small enterprises will now be governed by sectoral caps instead of the earlier 24 per cent ceiling on foreign holdings.         
	According to Press Note 6 issued by the department of industrial policy and promotion (DIPP), foreign investment in micro and small enterprises will now be subject to sectoral equity caps, entry routes and other relevant rules.        
	There are 21 items reserved for exclusive manufacture by small units, including pickles, wooden furniture, exercise books, glass bangles, wax candles and PVC pipes.         
	These industries will now be guided like other large enterprises as far as FDI is concerned, said DIPP officials.        
	However, industry players do not think the change will help small businesses attract higher overseas investments.         
	I do not think the Press Note will result in a fresh inflow of foreign direct investment. As far as FDI is concerned, there is no distinction between small and large industries as sectoral caps are the guiding principles, said Anil Bhardwaj, secretary-general of the Federation of Indian Micro and Small and Medium Enterprises.        
	Bhardwaj said the new Press Note was a continuation of the Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises Development Act, 2006, which removed the ceiling for equity participation, both domestic and foreign, in these units.        
	According to the 2006 act, micro manufacturing units are those where investment in plant and machinery does not exceed Rs 25 lakh, while small enterprises can invest between Rs 25 lakh and Rs 5 crore.         
	In the services sector, the investment in equipment is up to Rs 10 lakh for micro enterprises, and Rs 10 lakh to Rs 2 crore for small units.         
	The DIPP said the new Press Note replaces Press Note 18 of 1997, which said for a foreign collaboration, the maximum equity participation for small scale units was 24 per cent. A company would have to get itself deregistered as a small-scale unit for inducting foreign equity of more than 24 per cent.

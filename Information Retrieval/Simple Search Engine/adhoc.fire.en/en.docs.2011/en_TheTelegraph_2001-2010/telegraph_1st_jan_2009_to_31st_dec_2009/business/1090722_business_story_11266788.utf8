The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Airports high on priority list
                                                                                                               Airports high on priority list
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Mumbai, July 21: Anil Ambani intends to invest in airports  and he isnt fazed by the loss of the Mumbai and Delhi airports in a bidding war three years ago.        
	We will keenly pursue the upcoming projects for international airports at Navi Mumbai, Pune and Goa, Ambani told shareholders of Reliance Infrastructure here today.        
	The younger Ambani scion is also betting big on cement and aims to emerge as one of the top five players in this area in the next five years.        
	Ambani is hoping to realise both ambitions through Reliance Infrastructure (formerly BSES). He said the government wanted to modernise 35 non-metro airports, and it had opted for a public-private participation model for the purpose.        
	Taking air travel to Indias remoter regions and rural hinterland will throw up the next big opportunity for growth in the aviation sector, he said.        
	In 2006, Ambani was a serious contender for the modernisation of both the Delhi and Mumbai airports. He, however, lost out in the race to two consortia led by GMR and GVK, respectively.         
	The younger Ambani, however, sees good potential in the sector as there has been a sharp growth in air traffic in India in the past few years, and existing infrastructure at most airports is inadequate to deal with the surge in traffic.        
	Ambani said the foray into cement was a natural extension of the power and infrastructure interests of the group.        
	Reliance Infrastructure is planning to set up cement plants with an aggregate capacity of 20 million tonnes, annually, at a cost of nearly Rs 10,000 crore over the next five years, thus placing it amongst the top five players in the country.

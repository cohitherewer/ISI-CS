The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | House panel puts fetters on retail
                                                                                                               House panel puts fetters on retail
          JAYANTA ROY CHOWDHURY                          Tough time                                  
	New Delhi, June 8: A parliamentary standing committee on retail has proposed a ban on the entry of foreigners and domestic corporate houses, which could lead to the first policy spat within the UPA.        
	The recommendations of the committee, which is chaired by BJP leader Murli Manohar Joshi and has Trinamul Congress leader Dinesh Trivedi as a member, also include curbs on malls and a ban on multinationals in the cash-and-carry business as it is a mere camouflage for entering retail through the backdoor.         
	The committee recommends that a blanket ban be imposed on domestic corporate heavyweights and foreign retailers (to prevent them) from entering into retail trade in grocery, fruits and vegetables, it said. Restrictions should be put on opening large malls by them for selling other consumer products, it added.        
	The Trinamul Congress in its manifesto had taken a strong line against organised retail.         
	TMCs Trivedi, who is also the minister of state for health and family welfare, said, The recommendations were unanimous cutting across party lines. Now it is up to the government to implement it.         
	Trinamul is promoting the Lefts pet stands as its own to up the ante against its main political rival in Bengal.         
	According to CPM leader Nilotpal Basu, The report reflects our own demands for regulation of the retail sector and a ban on FDI in multi-brand retail. It should be taken into account by the government while formulating the FDI policy.         
	Top officials said the government would take the time-honoured way of getting out of this conflict by referring the report and its recommendations to an internal panel and then sit on it. This is a traditional tactic taken by governments to sweep under the carpet inconvenient suggestions.         
	However, the strongly worded report, which also calls for setting up a regulator and bringing an act to reserve some areas for small and medium players, will probably ensure that the government does not go ahead with its earlier plans to liberalise the sector.         
	We will probably be also asked to be cautious in granting cash-and-carry licences, though with the existing crisis in the retail market one cant see too many foreign retailers venturing here, said the officials.         
	Indian laws allow 51 per cent foreign equity in single-brand retail. Multinationals are not allowed in multi-brand retail, though they can set up cash-and-carry establishments having 100 per cent ownership.

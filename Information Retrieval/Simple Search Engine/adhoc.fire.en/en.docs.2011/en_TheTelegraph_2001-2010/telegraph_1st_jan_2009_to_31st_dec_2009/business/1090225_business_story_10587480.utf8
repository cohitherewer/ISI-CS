The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Tax cuts to benefit telecom 
                                                                                                               Tax cuts to benefit telecom 
          JAYATI GHOSE                          Music to ears                                  
	New Delhi, Feb. 24: Excise and service tax cuts announced today would reduce mobile tariff, network rollout costs for telecom service providers, and the price of printers and keyboards.         
	However, the information technology sector had expected an extension of the software park tax holiday.        
	The cut in service tax will benefit mobile users in both prepaid and post-paid categories, T. V. Ramachandran, director-general of the COAI, told The Telegraph.         
	On an average monthly bill of Rs 250, a consumer can expect a reduction of Rs 5. Telecom players feel even such small cuts help in the lower end of the market.         
	With around 40-50 per cent of new additions coming from rural and semi-urban segments, reduced tariff rates help the telecom company attract the untapped low-end customer base, said Ramachandran.        
	Vodafone Essar reacted to the cuts by launching a Bonus Card 39 for its pre-paid customers in Delhi. Priced at Rs 39, the card allows local calls at 60 paise a minute.        
	For new telecom players such as Datacom, Swan and Loop, the excise cut will reduce the cost of setting up base stations.        
	Moreover, with a cut in excise duty on hardware equipment to 8 per cent, the prices of printers, monitors, keyboard and other computer peripherals will go down, said Vinnie Mehta, executive director of the Manufacturers Association for Information Technology. The service tax cut will also provide some relief to computer industry, he said.        
	It would have been nice if the STPI (technology park) scheme was extended. However, the incentive is available till March 2010 and we expect the new government to take up the issue and do the needful, said Som Mittal, president of Nasscom.        
	Infotech firms, however, welcomed the move to provide full tax concessions to units in special economic zones that were divisions of the parent IT firm.

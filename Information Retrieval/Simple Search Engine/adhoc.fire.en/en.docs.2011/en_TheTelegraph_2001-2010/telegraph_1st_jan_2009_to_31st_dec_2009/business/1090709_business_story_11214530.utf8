The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | CLB clears Satyam preferential issue
                                                                                                               CLB clears Satyam preferential issue
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Mumbai, July 8: Mahindra Satyam Ltd today said it had received approval from the Company Law Board to issue shares to Tech Mahindra on a preferential basis.        
	This comes after the open offer made by Tech Mahindra to the shareholders of the Hyderabad-based company evoked a poor response.        
	In a statement to the stock exchanges today, Satyam said it would issue 19.86 crore new shares to Venturbay Consultants Pvt Ltd, a subsidiary of Tech Mahindra, at Rs 58 apiece. This will increase Tech Mahindras stake to 43 per cent in the IT firm.        
	In May, Venturbay had acquired 31 per cent in Satyam, comprising 30.27 crore shares at Rs 58 per share. This was in accordance with a share subscription agreement in April among Satyam, Venturbay and Tech Mahindra.        
	According to Sebi (Substantial Acquisition of Shares and Takeovers) Regulations, 1997, Venturbay made an open offer to acquire another 19.90 crore shares, or 20 per cent of Satyams equity, also for Rs 58 per share.        
	However, the open offer got a poor response from the Satyam shareholders as the open offer price was lower than the market price.        
	Venturbay has the option to increase its holding in Satyam to 51 per cent through a second preferential issue.        
	The Satyam scrip fell 70 paise to Rs 70.45 on the Bombay Stock Exchange today.        
	A Hyderabad court today extended the judicial custody of former Satyam chairman B. Ramalinga Raju and the others accused in the multi-crore Satyam scam till July 22.         
	Yesterday, the Andhra Pradesh government had cancelled the contract to Maytas Infra  promoted by the kin of Raju  for building the Rs 12,000-crore Hyderabad metro rail project.         
	Hit by the Satyam scam, Maytas had failed to achieve financial closure.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Coal India puts mine revival on fast track
                                                                                                               Coal India puts mine revival on fast track

	New Delhi, Oct. 5: ArcelorMittal and nine other firms have been shortlisted by Coal India to develop its abandoned mines in Bengal and Jharkhand.         
	We have selected 10 global companies, including ArcelorMittal, to develop 18 mines abandoned because of technical reasons in Jharkhand and Bengal. The mines have superior grade coal reserves of 1.6 billion tonnes, including 350 million tonnes of coking coal, Coal India chairman Partha Bhattacharyya told reporters here today.        
	The 18 mines are under the CIL subsidiaries of Eastern Coalfields, Central Coalfields and Bharat Coking Coal, spread over Bengal and Jharkhand.         
	We hope to sign a contract for one or two of these blocks this fiscal so that the mines can start production by 2013-14, Bhattacharyya said.         
	The coal ministry is expected to clear the signing of contracts soon.         
	The new coal policy does not have a provision for a joint venture partner picking up a 50 per cent stake in a coal mine and that is why the clearance is needed, he said.        
	Coal India plans to buy mines abroad by March. The company, which hopes to produce 435 million tonnes of coal in the current fiscal, had an output of 154.6 million tonnes during April-August 2009 compared with 140mt in the corresponding period last year.        
	The demand for coal during the current fiscal is expected to rise by 10 per cent from a year earlier. CIL, which is expected to divest about 10 per cent stake, is looking at mines in Australia, US, Indonesia and South Africa to meet the growing coal demand.

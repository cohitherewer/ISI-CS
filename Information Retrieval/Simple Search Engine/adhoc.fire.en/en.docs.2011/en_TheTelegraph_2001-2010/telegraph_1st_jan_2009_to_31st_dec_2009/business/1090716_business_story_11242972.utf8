	Calcutta, July 15: Tech Mahindra, which recently took over Satyam, is expanding in Calcutta.        
	The company today announced that it was setting up a BPO facility at DLF IT Park in Rajarhat.         
	Tech Mahindra already has two development centres in the city. The BPO unit will be spread over 50,000sqft and can accommodate 1,000 professionals.         
	The facility will start functioning by the end of this month. We will initially start with 500 professionals and the headcount will be ramped up to 1,000 by August, Sujit Baksi, president (corporate affairs) of Tech Mahindra, said.         
	This is Tech Mahindras first BPO unit in the eastern region and the fifth in the country. The others are in Noida, Pune, Chandigarh and Chennai. Tech Mahindras existing units in Calcutta employ about 1,100.         
	The new BPO will provide end-to-end customer service to telecom operators.         
	Tech Mahindra said it was yet to take a call on the 12 acres it had taken at the Bantala Leather Complex.

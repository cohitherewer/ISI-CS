The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Inflation dips to 3.92%
                                                                                                               Inflation dips to 3.92%
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                        
	New Delhi, Feb. 19: Inflation fell to a 13-month low of 3.92 per cent for the week ended February 7, raising hopes of a further cut in interest rates by the RBI. During the previous week, inflation was at 4.39 per cent, while it was 4.98 per cent a year ago.        
	Prices have cooled off because of cheaper fuels, food and non-food items.        
	According to analysts, monetary policies will now determine the growth course.         
	Weakening economic activity and lower-than-expected inflation data suggest that there is clearly more room for rate cuts. We expect the RBI to cut both the repo and the reverse repo rates by 50 basis points before March, said Sonal Varma of Nomura.        
	RBI governor D. Subbarao yesterday said there was room to cut interest rates.        
	D. K. Joshi of Crisil said he expected the RBI to cut the key interest rates by 50-100 basis points in the near term. In its policy review last month, the RBI did not change the rates.

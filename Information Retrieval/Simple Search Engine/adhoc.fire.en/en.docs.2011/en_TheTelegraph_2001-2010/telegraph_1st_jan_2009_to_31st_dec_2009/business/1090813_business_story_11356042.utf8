  Proposed rule tweak to widen tax ambit          OUR CORRESPONDENT                          All ears: Finance minister Pranab Mukherjee with home minister P. Chidambaram at the launch of the Direct Taxes Code in New Delhi on Wednesday. (PTI)                                        
	New Delhi, Aug. 12: Companies like Reliance Industries, which pay minimum alternate tax (MAT), could receive a big blow when the new tax code comes into effect.        
	The new tax code proposes to charge MAT at 2 per cent of gross assets instead of the present system of charging it at 15 per cent of book profits.        
	MAT was introduced in 1996 to counter the rapid increase of zero-tax companies who thrived on a cocktail of tax exemptions, deductions and high rates of depreciation.        
	The tax code says MAT will be levied at 0.25 per cent of the value of gross assets in the case of banking companies and 2 per cent for all other companies.        
	The other big change is that MAT will be treated as a final tax and cannot be carried forward to claim tax credits in subsequent years.        
	This is actually a bigger blow for MAT-paying companies. Finance minister Pranab Mukherjee had said in his recent budget that in order to provide relief to these companies, he would allow them to carry forward the tax credit for up to 10 years.        
	Analysts said the tax tweak would discourage asset-rich, low profit earning companies from continuing to take shelter under MAT.        
	The change in how MAT is computed is a major modification in the tax code. With MAT now proposed to be paid on the value of gross assets, it increases the tax liability of even companies that have no income, said Hemal Zobalia, executive director of PricewaterhouseCoopers.        
	The code added that shift in MAT base to gross assets will encourage optimal utilisation of the assets and thereby increase efficiency.         
	However, E amp;Ys Kapadia said the change would impact capital formation by companies. It will lead to capital intensive firms  which have more assets  paying higher taxes than services-based industries. The implication, analysts said, was that MAT-paying companies would no longer splurge money on new plants and factories.        
	Industry players also said a 2 per cent MAT computed on gross assets is extremely high by global standards. Internationally around 0.5-0.7 per cent MAT is charged by countries as a fixed percentage of the assets of the business, said Mukesh Butani, partner at BMR and Associates, a tax consultancy.        
	Corporate tax cut        
	The draft code also wanted to bring down the corporate tax rate to 25 per cent from 30 per cent charged earlier.        
	This is in lieu of removal of all exemptions. Only deductions on R amp;D and investment based deduction of capital expenditure in certain sectors such as oil and gas will be allowed under the new code, said Sudhir Kapadia, partner with Ernst amp; Young.        
	However, foreign companies with branches here would have to pay an extra 15 per cent on their remaining profits after paying the normal corporate tax.        
	Indian companies will have to pay a dividend distribution tax at a flat rate of 15 per cent of the amount declared by way of dividends, apart from the 25 per cent corporate tax. The dividend, however, will be exempt in the hands of the recipient.         
	The code proposed to treat all business assets as capital assets. On sale of assets, the normal rate of capital gains tax would now have to be paid, said Kapadia.        
	The new code also proposed to allow companies to carry forward indefinitely any losses incurred on business.        
	Currently, the law says that the business loss can be carried forward for eight years and can be set off only against future business profits. If it could be carried forward indefinitely, it would have been a great relief to the taxpayers, said R.C. Bhargav, chairman of Maruti Suzuki.        
	Certain amalgamation and demerger provisions have also been proposed in the code to allow for tax-neutral business reorganisation. The code said the transfer of investment assets in amalgamation (merger) or demerger would not be liable to pay capital gains tax if the merged entity was an Indian company.         
	The move is likely to promote business reorganisation through mergers or demergers between domestic firms.        
	Moreover, in order to fix tax liabilities arising from international transactions like global merger or acquisition, the code allows companies to enter into advance pricing agreements with the approval of the Centre.

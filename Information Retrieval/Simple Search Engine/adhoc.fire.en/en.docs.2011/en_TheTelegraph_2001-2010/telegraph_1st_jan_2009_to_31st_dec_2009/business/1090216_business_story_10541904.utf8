Interim budget to focus on jobs, growth          JAYANTA ROY CHOWDHURY                           Pranab Mukherjee in New Delhi on Sunday. Picture by Prem Singh                                        
	New Delhi, Feb. 15: The UPA governments interim budget will look at ways to revive the flagging economy and create more jobs.         
	Prime Minister Manmohan Singh today approved the interim budget, to be presented by external affairs minister Pranab Mukherjee in Parliament tomorrow. Mukherjee is currently in charge of the finance ministry.        
	With polls round the corner, the government will also seek to highlight its achievements of the previous five years. It will get an opportunity to showcase the high growth rate of over 9 per cent it has been able to maintain for the major part of its tenure.        
	Policy-wise, the emphasis will be on stepping up expenditure in flagship programmes and offering concessions to industry, reeling under the impact of the global economic slump.         
	The interim budget is supposed to be more of a vote to allow the spending of money during the few months this government has. By convention, it is not supposed to announce major changes, said S.P. Gupta, former member of the Planning Commission. According to analysts, the government is most likely to change some indirect tax rates to push up sales, just as the BJP did in its interim budget of 2004.         
	On the agenda are duty drawbacks and tax waivers on goods and services. The export sector, in specific, is likely to get further concessions.        
	However, many feel that the government may break conventions and offer direct tax sops to raise the level of disposable income and help drive up demand at the retail level. If it does so, it will be the first to introduce wide-ranging tax changes in an interim budget.         
	The tax concessions are expected to boost demand which, in turn, can reverse job losses.        
	The Congress, however, has a justification in the slowing economy.         
	The economy has slowed down and is expected to grow at just 7 per cent this year. Industry shrank by 2 per cent in December last year, and government data revealed that at least 5 lakh jobs had been lost.         
	Job creation obviously has to be on the top of this governments agenda, said Gupta.         
	The government is likely to increase the allocation for schemes such as the National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme. It will also try to start a similar urban scheme.         
	Allocations to the Jawaharlal Nehru Urban Renewal Mission scheme and other rural development and housing programmes will also be raised over last years budget.         
	Besides the budget stimulus, the government will depend on a co-ordinated money policy, which it expects the Reserve Bank of India to announce next week.         
	The central bank may cut key policy rates, according to the PMs economic advisory council. The repo rate has already been cut by 3.5 percentage points since October last year.         
	Mukherjee has nothing to lose from this budget. If the UPA is re-elected, this budget will be at best fine-tuned. If the Congress fails to come to power, the budget proposals will be scrapped.

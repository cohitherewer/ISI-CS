The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Cement prices to drop
                                                                                                               Cement prices to drop
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Mumbai, Feb. 24: Cement prices are likely to soften by Rs 3-4 per 50-kg bag following the governments decision to cut the excise duty on bulk cement.        
	Cement prices now hover around Rs 220-250 per bag.        
	According to industry experts, cement accounts for 10-13 per cent of construction cost.         
	Real estate is among the largest consumers of cement, and a reduction in its price is expected to have a positive impact on construction.        
	The government today said the excise duty on bulk cement would be cut to 8 per cent, or Rs 230 per tonne, whichever was higher.        
	Though the industry is likely to pass on the benefits of the excise duty cut, a few observers feel the relief will not make much of an impact. This is because for some companies bulk cement accounts for a small portion of their sales.        
	D.D. Rathi, the CFO of Grasim Industries, said bulk cement accounted for only 10 per cent of its total sales.         
	At this stage we would not like to comment by how much the prices would come down, but they could turn cheaper by Rs 3 per bag, he said.        
	Cement stocks rose on the BSE today. Grasim gained 3 per cent to Rs 1,384.65, while ACC rose less than a per cent to end at Rs 558.80.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Trai links 2G spectrum bid to user base 
                                                                                                               Trai links 2G spectrum bid to user base 
          JAYATI GHOSE                                    
	New Delhi, Oct. 11: The Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai) has proposed a mix of auction and subscriber-linked criteria for the allocation of additional second-generation (2G) spectrum.        
	The eligibility of an operator to bid for the next incremental quantum of spectrum will depend on whether the operator meets a minimum subscriber base, Trai said in its report on 2G spectrum allocation.        
	The regulator said periodic sales of fresh quotas of spectrum through a combination of the auction and subscriber principles were worth considering. It will soon submit the report to the department of telecom (DoT).        
	In July, the DoT had asked Trai for its suggestions on the allocation of spectrum, or radiowaves.         
	The regulator had earlier sought time till November to submit the report.         
	The government has put on hold any fresh allocation of 2G spectrum and licences till the policy is finalised.        
	The finance and law ministries are in favour of auctioning spectrum to both the new and existing operators who require additional spectrum for expansion.        
	India is the only country where 2G radio frequencies are given to operators based on their subscriber strength. They are given additional radiowaves every time subscriber numbers touch a limit.        
	Trai has also proposed that incremental spectrum be given to GSM operators in tranches of 1 megahertz (MHz). The operators are now given additional radiowaves in blocks of 1.8-2.2 MHz.         
	Trai has asked the DoT to set up a technical committee to evaluate and specify the method of allocating spectrum.        
	The committee should conduct the study needed to establish the rules for implementing the method recommended by it (Trai), said the report.        
	Another committee set up by the DoT recently to review the policy has also recommended the auction of fresh spectrum and doing away with subscriber-based criteria.        
	Sale norm        
	For the existing players, the Trai report proposes that spectrum be auctioned beyond 6.2 MHz. Regarding the new players, the spectrum allocation and grant of licence should be delinked, meaning they must bid for even the 4.4MHz start-up frequencies.        
	At present, a telecom licence comes bundled with 4.4 MHz of GSM spectrum, which is the minimum amount required to launch mobile services.         
	The practice of allocating radiowaves on the basis of subscribers had hit a hurdle in 2007 when the government decided to increase the number of users that would make the operators eligible for additional spectrum. All telecom service providers in India offer their services using 2G airwaves.        
	Operators are facing an acute spectrum shortage  specifically in Delhi and Mumbai  because of a huge addition of subscribers every month. The situation has worsened with the inability of the defence authorities to vacate spectrum.

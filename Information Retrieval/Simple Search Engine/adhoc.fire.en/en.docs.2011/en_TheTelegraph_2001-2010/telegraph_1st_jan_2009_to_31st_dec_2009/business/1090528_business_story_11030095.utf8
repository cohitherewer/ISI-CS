	New Delhi, May 27: Finance minister Pranab Mukherjee will discuss with the leaders of various parties his plan to clear the budget by July 31.         
	The interim budget was for four months up to July 31. I will try to complete the entire exercise by July 31, he said.        
	If leaders agree to relax scrutiny by standing committees, that will help me complete the exercise by July 31, he said. Finance ministry officials said attempts would be made to shorten the periods of scrutiny by standing committees and debates in Parliament.        
	The government wishes to place the budget in Parliament in the first week of July, and have it passed by end-July. This is not without precedence and has been done earlier too, said officials.

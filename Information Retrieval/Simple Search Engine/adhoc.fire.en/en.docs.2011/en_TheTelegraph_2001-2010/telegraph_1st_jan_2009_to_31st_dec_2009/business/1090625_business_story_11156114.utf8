          JAYANTA ROY CHOWDHURY                          Banerjee: Listing priorities                                  
	New Delhi, June 24: Railway minister Mamata Banerjee will meet Prime Minister Manmohan Singh tomorrow to discuss the railway budget.        
	Besides some sops for the poor, Banerjee has lined up some innovative proposals such as stations running on solar power and captive power plants.        
	She is keen that the railways overhaul the creaking tracks; another major concern for her is to generate funds for all the expenditures.        
	Sources said she might also discuss Lalgarh and raise the issue of the need for the Congress to take the other UPA partners on board before taking major policy decisions such as banning the Maoists.         
	On the agenda in the meeting with Singh is the politics of new trains  her staff has been inundated with some 600 representations from MPs for new trains and lines. The railways are planning a Rs 20 monthly pass for the poor, an overhaul of the old tracks and high speed demonstration trains connecting Delhi to Calcutta and Mumbai.         
	Banerjee will also focus on freight earning, which is the real cash cow for the railways. More than 15,000 wagons may be ordered and freight loadings may top 900 million tonnes to boost income.        
	Railway board officials said Mamata was concerned about the financial situation  there are apprehensions that much of the reserves of Rs 90,000 crore are mainly on paper.         
	On top of that the railways will have to shell out some Rs 14,000 crore extra this year to pay for the arrears and the higher wages awarded by the Sixth Pay Commission.

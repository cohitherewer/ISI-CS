	New Delhi, June 24: Oil and Natural Gas Corporation Ltds fourth-quarter profit fell 16 per cent to Rs 2,207 crore from Rs 2,627 crore a year ago. However, the upstream oil major remained bullish for the current financial year.        
	The profits fell as ONGC had to share the subsidy burden of oil marketing companies who were selling fuel below cost.         
	It also had to set aside Rs 860 crore as provision for a matter under arbitration.        
	I do feel these negative pressures will not be there during the current fiscal and I see every reason for the results to be better, R.S. Sharma, chairman and managing director of ONGC, said.        
	In January, the government had assured ONGC that there would be no subsidy burden in the March quarter. But in late May, the government said it would have to bear a subsidy bill of Rs 852 crore for the March quarter.        
	With global crude prices now rising, ONGCs burden could again increase unless the government implements a proposal to deregulate fuel prices.         
	Petroleum minister Murli Deora has said that a plan to free prices may be presented to the cabinet as part of the ministrys 100-day programme.        
	ONGCs consolidated net profit for 2008-09 fell 0.4 per cent to Rs 19,795.34 crore from Rs 19,872.28 crore in 2007-08. The refiner, however, registered its highest turnover in 2008-09 at Rs 1,09,294 crore, up 7.4 per cent from Rs 1,01,835 crore earned during the previous fiscal.

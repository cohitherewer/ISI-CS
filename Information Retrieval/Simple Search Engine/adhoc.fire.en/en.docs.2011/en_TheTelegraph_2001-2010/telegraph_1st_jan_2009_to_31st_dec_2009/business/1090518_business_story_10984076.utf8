The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Win raises dream budget hope   Deficit poses a challenge
                                                                                                               Win raises dream budget hope     Deficit poses a challenge
          JAYANTA ROY CHOWDHURY amp;; R. SURYAMURTHY      
	New Delhi, May 17: The Congress-led alliance, preparing to form a government at the Centre, is likely to announce a stimulus package with the budget.         
	Top finance ministry officials said they would take between six and eight weeks to prepare a budget after a new government was sworn in. We expect the budget to address the need for a fresh stimulus package, which the Congress manifesto, too, has spoken of, senior officials in the ministrys budget division said.         
	Expansion of the rural job guarantee scheme, a similar scheme for the urban areas and cheap grain for the poor are expected in the package.         
	Besides, the government will focus on infrastructure projects, which should create jobs and boost growth. Quick gestation projects where the money will get spent within this calendar year may get the nod. Policy-makers have also been toying with deeper tax cuts, which can see the prices of manufactures falling and demand going up.        
	 However, the government is facing a huge fund crunch, constraining it from providing too many sops.         
	It has already committed itself to higher spending on employment guarantee schemes and food security, and this is likely to constrain us in attempting deeper tax cuts which the industry has been clamouring for, said the officials. Already, the country is burdened with a combined fiscal deficit of the Centre and the states of above 11 per cent of GDP.         
	Industry, among other things, wants a reduction in excise duties on automobiles to 8 per cent and cuts in import duties on raw materials to 5 per cent from the current average of 10 per cent along with the lowering of personal tax rates.         
	For the new coalition, time is short, for it must be ready with the budget by July 31  the last government had got a vote-on-account till that date. The budget could be delayed by going for a second vote-on-account, but this would not go down well with the global markets.        
	In the budget, the officials are expecting the continuation of existing policies. Our reading of the manifestos of the coalition parties does not show any great deviation from goals set earlier by Manmohan Singh about bringing down fiscal deficit and cutting red tape to usher in faster growth.        
	The continuation may be tempered by some amount of tightrope walking to balance the various demands of the coalition partners.        
	The policy on PSUs is expected to retain the ban on the sale of profit-making PSUs, though it will not stop market offerings and the outright sale of sick entities.        
	Besides, the government would bring in regulation for corporate governance to instil confidence among small investors in the wake of the Satyam scandal. State investments in agriculture and a second phase of green revolution are also on the cards.         
	Investment in social and physical infrastructure is likely to be a major priority, with targeted spending on health at up to 2 per cent of GDP and education at 6 per cent.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Jan. 19: Fixed deposit documents and other instruments seized from Satyams offices seem to be fake, according to investigators.         
	Officers of the Serious Frauds Investigation Office have impounded around Rs 3,300 crore of such papers, including fixed deposits of over Rs 2,000 crore.        
	Analysts said if this was correct, bankers and auditors could get off the hook.         
	Letters from banks such as ICICI, Citi, Bank of Baroda, BNP Paribas and HDFC do not even have stamps, the investigators said.        
	Most banks have said they never issued deposit certificates to Satyam. Earlier, Satyams chief financial officer Srinivas Vadlamani had told CID officials that bank deposits were handled by B. Ramalinga Raju. Vadlamani had specifically been told not to look into them.         
	However, investigators wondered why analysts and auditors failed to spot any malpractice.        
	Even banks did not try to find out who among them held Satyams deposits.         
	The officials said that they would have to find out who else from Satyam was involved in forging bank letters, if these were indeed fake.         
	Forgery could not have been done alone or without anyones knowledge in the company ... there must have been a team working on this, the officials said.

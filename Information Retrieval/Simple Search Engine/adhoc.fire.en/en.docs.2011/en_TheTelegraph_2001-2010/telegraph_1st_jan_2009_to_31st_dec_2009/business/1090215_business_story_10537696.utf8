	A local court yesterday granted two days to the SFIO to examine and record the statements of the accused in the Satyam scam.The SFIO team will also interrogate two sacked employees of Price Waterhouse  S. Gopalakrishnan and Talluri Srinivas.        
	The income tax department has also filed a petition, seeking three days time to examine and record the statement of Raju. The judge has posted the matter to Monday as the defence lawyer sought time to file a reply.

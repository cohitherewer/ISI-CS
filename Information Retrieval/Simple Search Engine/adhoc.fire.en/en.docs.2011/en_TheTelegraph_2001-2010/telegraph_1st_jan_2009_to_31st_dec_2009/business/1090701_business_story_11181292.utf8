The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | SBI bid to lure home buyers
                                                                                                               SBI bid to lure home buyers
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                            
	Mumbai, June 30: The State Bank of India today launched a scheme that could cap the interest rate on home loans under Rs 30 lakh below 10 per cent.        
	The 10 per cent rate cap will work only if the benchmark rates do not rise  a plausible prospect in the current falling rate scenario. The new home loan scheme has been unveiled less than a week before the Union budget.         
	For home loan seekers, there are two aspects that they should look out for in Pranab Mukherjees fourth budget: an increase in the tax deduction benefit on the interest paid on home loans from the current limit of Rs 1.5 lakh a year to Rs 2 lakh. The other big expectation is a hike in the ceiling on priority home loans to Rs 30 lakh from Rs 20 lakh now.        
	SBI seemed to anticipate the second change today when it set a Rs 30-lakh floor for its SBI Easy Home Loan Scheme, which will carry a fixed interest rate of 8 per cent in the first year and 9 per cent in the second and third years.        
	From the fourth year onwards, the home loan customers can choose between a floating rate of 2 per cent below the SBI Advance Rate (SBAR) prevailing at that point of time or a fixed rate of 1 per cent below SBAR.        
	The advance rate now stands at 11.75 per cent. Assuming that there is no change in this benchmark rate, the floating interest rate will be effectively capped at 9.75 per cent. There is a reset clause every five years, but customers may not have to worry too much in a falling interest rate scenario.        
	The SBI also came out with another scheme for home loans above Rs 30 lakh that had slightly higher rates of interest. Called the SBI Advantage Home Loan which targets home buyers in the premium segment, the SBI said the interest rate would be fixed at 8 per cent for the first year and 9.5 per cent for the second and third years. From the fourth year onwards, the customer can choose between a floating rate at 1 per cent below SBAR and a fixed rate of 0.5 per cent below SBAR with a five year reset clause.        
	This is not the first time that the SBI is coming out with an attractive scheme to lure retail home loan borrowers. In February, it had surprised all by freezing the interest rate on home loans for a period of one year at 8 per cent.        
	While the chief of a leading housing finance company called it a gimmick, Canara Bank brought out an attractive similar scheme wherein it provided home loans at 8.25 per cent for the first year and 9 per cent fixed for the next five years. After that, it will be 200 basis points below the BPLR from the sixth to the 20th year.        
	A senior SBI official said the present plan was a modification of an older scheme called the SBI Special announced in December 2008. Last year, nationalised banks came together under the aegis of Indian Banks Association to stimulate growth in the lower end of the housing spectrum. Under the scheme, the banks were offering loans up to Rs 5 lakh for a tenure of 20 years at an interest rate not exceeding 8.50 per cent.

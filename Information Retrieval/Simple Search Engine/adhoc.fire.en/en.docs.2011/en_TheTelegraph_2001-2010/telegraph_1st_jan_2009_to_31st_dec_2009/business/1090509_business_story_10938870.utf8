	Calcutta, May 8: GE Healthcare, a unit of General Electric, plans to spend about $6 billion by 2015 on low-cost healthcare.        
	GE will invest $3 billion in research and development to deliver better healthcare to more people at lower cost, said T.C. Chopra, GE Indias president and chief executive officer, while announcing the Healthymagination global initiative in Bangalore.         
	The company also introduced two India-specific products  Lullaby Baby Warmer and Logiq P3.         
	The company will commit $2 billion over the next six years to drive healthcare initiatives in rural areas.         
	Another $1 billion will be spent on partnerships, content and services, he said.        
	The drive will focus on the research and development of new technologies that will help lower the cost of using GEs CT-scan machines and other devices by 15 per cent. GE said it would focus on simpler, less costly equipment such as portable ultrasound machines. Were going to have more products at different price points in the future, chief executive Jeff Immelt said in a statement.         
	GE said it was not trying to reach the $8-billion sales target for the country by 2010. We are not focusing on the aspirational $8-billion target, which was set about 2-3 years back. But the company is confident about the long-term opportunities, Chopra said.

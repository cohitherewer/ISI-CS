          JAYANTA ROY CHOWDHURY                          Drill time                                  
	New Delhi, May 21: The new government has open auctions of coal mines for captive use on the list of reforms that it plans to initiate quickly.        
	The government has already drafted the Mines and Minerals (Development amp; Regulation) Amendment Bill and may either try to push this through Parliament or bring in an ordinance.        
	Besides, the government will try to work out a compromise with iron-ore-rich states who have rejected the new mineral policy.         
	The policy has proposed the auction of iron-ore mines instead of the grant of leases to concessionaires on the back of promises to invest in a state.        
	Officials said currently coal and iron-ore mines were allocated to steel mills and power plants by the central government, but often questions of transparency arose.         
	The central government believes a bidding process is necessary; otherwise, transparency gets compromised and a state is robbed off mineral riches merely on the basis of promises.         
	The government has asked states to suggest alternatives in iron-ore. At the same time, it is working on a compromise plan that proposes multiple criteria in the selection of a bidder with weights attached to each. These include the bid value in an open auction, investment plans in the state where the mine is located and proposals on social infrastructure.         
	Mineral-rich but backward states such as Jharkhand, Orissa, Chhattisgarh have been arguing that promises by steel makers, for instance, to set up mills in return for mineral concessions were the only way to development.         
	PSUs joint venture        
	State-owned power and steel companies have come together and set up a joint venture firm for coal equity abroad.        
	Five firms  NTPC, Steel Authority of India, Coal India, Rashtriya Ispat Nigam and NMDC  today registered the long planned joint venture firm, International Coal Ventures Pvt Ltd, to acquire or operate coal mines and blocks.         
	Industry sources said the joint venture firm was exploring opportunities to acquire coal fields in Zimbabwe, Russia, Indonesia, Australia, Canada and Mozambique. It is also looking at picking up stakes in Australian, Canadian and Brazilian companies.

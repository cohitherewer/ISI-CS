The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Tatas tap employees for funds 
                                                                                                               Tatas tap employees for funds

	Mumbai, Feb. 8: Tata Capital will turn to the employees of the $62.5-billion Tata group in its hunt for subscribers for its AA+ rated Rs 500-crore non-convertible debenture (NCD) issue that closes on February 24.         
	The over 3,00,000-employee base of the Tata group will serve as a captive segment for Tata Capital to market this issue that has a greenshoe option of Rs 1,000 crore.         
	Speaking to The Telegraph, Tata Capitals head of investment banking J. Niranjan said, We are definitely retail focused in the marketing of this issue. While the Tata group employees will be targeted, they are not the only focus of the issue.         
	The financial arm of the Tata group plans to not just tap employees in this issue, but will also use the distribution strength of the groups various retail formats to market the offer.         
	Apart from the Rs 500-crore NCD issue, Tata Capital will also approach the group employees for Tata Motors fixed deposit scheme.         
	Tata Motors has so far garnered Rs 610 crore from the public for the scheme that opened in early December and offers 10.5 per cent for a two-year tenure and 11 per cent for a three-year deposit.         
	Since the fixed deposit is an open-ended, on tap product, it will be easier to market it to the employees especially since it requires a lower level of sophistication from the depositor compared with the NCD issue subscriber who, for instance, needs to maintain a demat account, said a financial services expert.         
	The general expectation is that Tata Motors will get anywhere between Rs 1,500 crore and Rs 2,000 crore from this fixed deposit scheme, said a Tata group senior official.         
	The groups ecosystem comprising dealers, vendors and other relationships affiliated with group companies will also come in handy when it comes to finding customers for Tata Capitals fund raising.         
	While we may not have access to cheap funds compared with commercial banks, we have the advantage of leveraging from the Tata groups ecosystem for our lending activities and, therefore, lowering our credit risk, Niranjan said. Around 50 per cent of the money raised by Tata Capital finds its way out of the Tata ecosystem.         
	Tata Capital, which will be raising high cost funds from the 12 per cent NCD issue, expects to lower these costs. Funds raised from the issue will be pooled with the companys existing book of roughly Rs 8,000 crore that has been raised at lower rates of interest, thus bringing down the average cost of funds.        
	The issue has opened on February 2 and the minimum investment is Rs 10,000.

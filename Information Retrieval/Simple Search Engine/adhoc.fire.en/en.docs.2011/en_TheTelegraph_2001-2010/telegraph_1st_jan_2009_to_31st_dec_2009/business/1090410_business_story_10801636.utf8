                                                                                                               Inflation slips to 0.26%

	New Delhi, April 9: Inflation declined to a three-decade low of 0.26 per cent in the fourth week of March, giving room to the RBI to cut rates in its monetary policy slated for April 21.        
	Wholesale price-based inflation declined 0.05 percentage points for the week ended March 28 from 0.31 per cent in the previous week, though food prices remained high.        
	Although inflation is inching towards zero, the average rate of price rise works out to 8.4 per cent for the entire 2008-09 against 4.7 per cent in the previous fiscal.        
	I expect a 50 basis point cut in the repo (short-term lending) rate by the RBI during the month as inflation is expected to slip into negative territory, Crisil principal economist D.K. Joshi said.         
	According to RIS director-general Nagesh Kumar, Inflation is low because of a drop in demand and crisis of confidence.         
	During the week, the minerals group declined 11.8 per cent because of the prices of fire clay going down 19 per cent, iron ore by 14 per cent and chromite by 2 per cent. The prices of tea, sugar and linseed declined, but the overall food index rose 0.3 per cent.        
	During the week, the prices of food items such as barley increased 5 per cent. Ragi, bajra and fruit and vegetables were dearer by 2 per cent each.         
	Elsewhere, the prices of raw rubber went up 8 per cent and raw cotton by 2 per cent.

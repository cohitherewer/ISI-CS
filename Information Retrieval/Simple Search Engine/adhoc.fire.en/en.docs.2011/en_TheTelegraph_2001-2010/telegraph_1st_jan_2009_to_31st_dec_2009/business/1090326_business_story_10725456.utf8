The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Spice rethink on Satyam bidding
                                                                                                               Spice rethink on Satyam bidding
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Mumbai, March 25: Bidders for Satyam Computer Services have started to get cold feet, sensing that the beleaguered software giant isnt going to put out too much of reliable information about its financial health.         
	B.K. Modi of Spice Corp  one of the six known bidders in the race  has indicated that he might pull out since there doesnt seem to be a great deal of transparency in the bidding process. Sources say Modi is angry over the fact that Satyam hasnt yet disclosed the names of the other bidders. The bidders had submitted formal expressions of interest (EOIs) last Friday and backed it up with proof that they had at least Rs 1,500 crore on call to support any bid they made.        
	The Spice group is reportedly upset with some of the terms of the bidding process. Modi has been insisting on an e-auction that will allow multiple rounds of bidding. However, Satyam told the capital market watchdog Sebi yesterday that there would be a second round of bidding only if one or more of the contestants came within 90 per cent of the highest bid.        
	Modi had also estimated the potential liability of the class action suits against Satyam in the US at Rs 500 crore. Satyam, however, expressed its inability to reveal the extent of liabilities being faced by it in the US. The legal claims will influence the size of the bids.        
	If a qualified bidder has any queries on the pending class action lawsuits in the US against the company, such a bidder will be permitted to discuss such lawsuits through its legal counsel with the US legal counsel representing the company on such matters as part of the due diligence. However, neither the company nor its counsel will be in a position to provide an estimate of the potential claim values or settlement values in such class action suits. The bidder may undertake its own independent assessment based on publicly available information, Satyam told the bidders.        
	Modi is believed to have written a letter to the Satyam management seeking more clarity on various issues. This, however, could not be confirmed.        
	The development comes at a time when the due diligence process at Satyam has commenced. It will last till April 4. Indications are that the financial bids could be called by April 9.

                                                                                                               Magor firm hunts for land in Gujarat
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Calcutta, Feb. 10: Williamson Magor Group company McNally Sayaji plans to set up a manufacturing facility in Gujarat at an investment of Rs 150 crore over the next three years.        
	We are looking for a 25-acre plot in Gujarat and hope to finalise it in a month, McNally chairman Deepak Khaitan said.         
	McNally acquired Sayaji Iron amp; Engineering Co Ltd last year and increased its stake to 92 per cent in November.        
	Khaitan said McNally Sayaji targeted a turnover of over Rs 500 crore over the next three years against Rs 210 crore now.        
	McNally Sayajis manufacturing plant in Vadodara spread over six acres  is incapable of supporting expansion. We need more space, Khaitan said, adding that the company might also relocate its existing facility to the proposed unit in Gujarat.        
	McNally has facilities in Asansol and at Kumardubi and plans to start production at its Bangalore plant soon.        
	We see good growth in the products business on better orders from engineering and infrastructure projects, Khaitan said. Another group company, Eveready Industries, will focus on the non-battery segment.         
	Eveready plans to introduce at least 10 products in the segment before the festive season this year.         
	The company expects non-batteries segment to match its core battery business over the next two years.         
	At present, batteries contribute about 70 per cent to Evereadys total business.        
	Eveready today launched a lighting equipment for the rural areas and plans to sell a modified version in the urban areas soon.

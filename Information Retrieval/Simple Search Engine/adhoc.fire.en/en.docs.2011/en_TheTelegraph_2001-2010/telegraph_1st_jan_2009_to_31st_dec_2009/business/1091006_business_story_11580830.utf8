                                                                                                               Bharati raises offer for Great Offshore
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                          
	Mumbai, Oct. 5: Bharati Shipyard, which is engaged in a battle with ABG Shipyard to gain control of Great Offshore, today raised the open offer price for the offshore service provider to Rs 560 per share.        
	Following the revision in the offer price, the size of the open offer proposal now stands at Rs 438.3 crore.         
	The company, which holds a 22.48 per cent share in Great Offshore, had earlier offered to acquire 20 per cent for Rs 405 per share.        
	ABG Shipyard has made an open offer to buy over 32.12 per cent stake in Great Offshore at Rs 520 per share.        
	In a communication to the bourses today, Bharati Shipyard said its revision of the open offer price followed the acquisition of a 3.01 per cent stake in Great Offshore by Dhanshree Properties (a group company) from the open market on September 16.        
	Based on the highest price paid for acquiring some of the shares, the open offer price now stands revised at Rs 560 per share, the company said.         
	Shares of Bharati Shipyard closed at Rs 194.95, down 3.01 per cent, while Great Offshore settled down 0.45 per cent at Rs 558 on the BSE.         
	Bharati had acquired close to 11 lakh shares of Great Offshore through block deals last month on both the Bombay Stock Exchange and the National Stock Exchange. The stake purchase took Bharatis holding in Great Offshore to a tad less than 23 per cent.         
	Bharati acquired 7.56 lakh shares on the BSE and 3.60 lakh shares on the NSE through bulk deals at an average price of Rs 558.80 a share.        
	ABG now holds under 11 per cent in Great Offshore. Both the companies have been acquiring Great Offshore shares from the market and revising their open offer prices.         
	Market circles feel Bharati is keen to get close to the 26-per-cent-mark so that it will have a say in the management of Great Offshore.        
	However, Bharati said it intended to consolidate its shareholding in Great Offshore and provide stability to the existing management. The company had no intention of gaining management control, a statement said.

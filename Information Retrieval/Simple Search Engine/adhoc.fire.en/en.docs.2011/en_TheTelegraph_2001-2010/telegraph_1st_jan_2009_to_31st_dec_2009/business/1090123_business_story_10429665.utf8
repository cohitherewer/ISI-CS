	New Delhi, Jan. 22: Ranbaxy Laboratories today suffered a net loss of Rs 679.80 crore for the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2008 because of foreign exchange drainage.        
	The adoption of Accounting Standard 30 caused a huge forex loss of Rs 784 crore during the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2008, Ranbaxy said in a statement.         
	Under the new accounting norms, Ranbaxy had to make a mark-to-market entry based on a fair valuation of the foreign exchange contracts and bonds it had issued. In other words, it had to put a current value to a futures contract.        
	The drug firm had a net profit of Rs 187.80 crore in the fourth quarter of the previous fiscal, the statement said.        
	Sales rose 6.38 per cent to Rs 1,909.60 crore for the quarter under review from Rs 1,795.10 crore in the corresponding period last fiscal.

	Shares of Ranbaxy closed at Rs 186.10, down 8.89 per cent on the Bombay Stock Exchange.        
	Company chairman and managing director Malvinder Mohan Singh said, The past year has been a significant one. We saw ourselves redefining paradigms in the pharmaceutical space through the alliance we reached with Daiichi Sankyo. However, we also faced hurdles such as the USFDA import alert and unprecedented forex volatility following an unforeseen global financial crisis.        
	Through several path-breaking initiatives, we have secured a future of high growth for the company while we are focused on resolving the ongoing issues that have adversely impacted us this year, he said in the statement.        
	In June last year, Ranbaxy and Japans Daiichi Sankyo signed a deal with the latter acquiring a majority stake of 63.92 per cent in the Indian firm.

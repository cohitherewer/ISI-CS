The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Govt puts off oil hunt   Confusion over tax breaks 
                                                                                                               Govt puts off oil hunt   Confusion over tax breaks 
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Deora: Halt order                                        
	New Delhi, April 17: The government has deferred the latest round of bidding for oil and gas blocks just a week after its formal launch because of a lack of clarity over tax breaks in gas production.        
	Bidders were unhappy that gas did not enjoy a tax holiday as was the case with oil.        
	The Prime Ministers Office had criticised the ministries concerned for not resolving the issue. Sources said the PMO had raised doubts about the success of the eighth round of bidding under the New Exploration and Licensing Policy (Nelp-VIII) because of the confusion among global companies.        
	The petroleum ministry has, therefore, decided to defer the bidding by cancelling the road shows scheduled from next week.        
	Petroleum minister Murli Deora said, Concerns had been expressed by potential bidders on lack of tax holidays for natural gas, similar to the ones given to crude oil production. We could not have got the issue sorted out just now because of the elections. So, we decided that let the issue be dealt by the new government.        
	The promotional road shows for the 70 oil and gas blocks on offer under Nelp-VIII and 10 coal bed methane areas were to begin on April 20.         
	In Union Budget 2008-09, the finance ministry had scrapped the seven-year tax holiday on natural gas production. Though oil and gas occur together and a single well can be producing both, the incentive was restricted only to crude oil. Analysts said foreign firms expected political and fiscal stability as they would invest huge sums.        
	Global players want a level-playing field for both oil and gas. With the elections on in the country, and the new government to decide on the fiscal benefit, it is expected that E amp;P players will wait and watch, said Deepak Pareek, energy analyst with Angel Broking.

	New Delhi, Nov. 14: The countrys annual rate of inflation based on wholesale prices rose sharply to 1.34 per cent in October from 0.5 per cent in the previous month on account of costlier minerals and fuels.         
	The government today switched to using monthly inflation data for all commodities with 1993-94 as the base year from the earlier practice of announcing weekly price movements. The wholesale price index was 11.06 per cent a year ago.        
	The monthly release of WPI is a widely followed international practice and the government expects the decision to improve the quality of the WPI.        
	Data on the official wholesale price index released on today showed that while minerals and industrial fuels (furnace oil) were each costlier by 3 per cent, food prices had declined by 1 per cent from the previous months level.        
	On the food index, prices were lower for fruits amp; vegetables (11 per cent), bajra (3 per cent), maize and poultry chicken (2 per cent each) and jowar (1 per cent).

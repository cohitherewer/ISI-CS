          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                      
	New Delhi, May 19: Pranab Mukherjee is unlikely to become the finance minister, a post he held from 1982-84. The MP from Bengals Jangipur currently holds additional charge of the ministry.        
	The job is likely to go either to a younger Congress leader such as Kamal Nath or an economic expert such as former RBI governor C. Rangarajan or plan panel deputy chairman Montek Singh Ahluwalia.         
	Sources close to Mukherjee said the Congress leader would prefer to remain in South Block in his present job as foreign minister. He enjoyed his additional responsibility as finance minister after P. Chidambaram was given charge of home affairs, but he does not really want this job as a full-time charge, said sources.         
	However, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, who depends upon Mukherjee on a large number of issues and has placed him as the head of numerous ministerial groups, may still try to persuade him to take on the job.         
	Sources say if Congress chief Sonia Gandhi and Prime Minister Manmohan Singh decide that the job has to go to a politician, it could then be commerce minister Kamal Nath. The MP from Madhya Pradeshs Chhindwara has the experience of handling the commerce ministry and has deftly handled tricky international trade negotiations.        
	However, if they decide to opt for a non-political person, C. Rangarajan, currently a Rajya Sabha MP, or Montek Singh Ahluwalia could be taken on for the job.         
	Both are believed to be close to Manmohan Singh. Ahluwalia was finance secretary during Singhs tenure as the finance minister in the 1990s.         
	Rangarajan was the chairman of the PMs economic advisory council till he was elected to the Rajya Sabha.

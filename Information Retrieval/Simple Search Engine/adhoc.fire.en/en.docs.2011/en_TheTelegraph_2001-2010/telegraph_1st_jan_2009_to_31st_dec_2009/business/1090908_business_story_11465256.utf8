The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Austerity drive in full swing
                                                                                                               Austerity drive in full swing
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                             
	New Delhi, Sept. 7: The government today asked all ministries to cut non-plan expenses under select heads by 10 per cent so that it had sufficient resources to fight a looming drought.        
	Following an order by Sushma Nath, secretary at the department of expenditure, the partial cut will be on expenditure on travel, publicity, professional services and equipment purchase, except security gadgets. Office expenses will also be cut by 10 per cent.        
	Besides, there will be a full ban on meetings and conferences in five-star hotels, travelling by first class, undertaking study tours and holding conferences abroad at government expense. The purchase of vehicles will not be permitted, except for security forces.         
	All other non-plan expenses will be cut by 5 per cent.        
	However, interest payouts, defence expenses, salaries and pensions are outside the ambit of the cuts. The total non-plan expenditure stands at a staggering Rs 6,95,689 crore. Interest outgo, defence spend and pensions account for the bulk at Rs 3,90,000 crore.         
	Total savings from this order should be about Rs 35,000 crore, officials said.         
	Finance secretary Ashok Chawla had earlier hinted at an expenditure cut when he said, Well get what we want (extra money to combat drought) by way of taxes, and if necessary, well be making adjustments in the existing budget.         
	Government officials said the order was issued so that more could be spent on flagship programmes such as the rural jobs scheme as well as on food subsidies. The weakest monsoon in at least seven years has resulted in drought in 278 of the countrys 626 districts, damaging crops such as rice, sugar cane and oilseeds.         
	Finance ministry officials said, Saving is the only way out to give relief to farmers as we have already budgeted to borrow some Rs 4,06,000 crore  a huge amount by any standards. We do not wish to add to this debt burden. Naths order issued today asked secretaries and financial advisers of various departments to ensure that the austerity instructions were enforced.

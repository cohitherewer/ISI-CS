The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Gas tariff hike in pipeline
                                                                                                               Gas tariff hike in pipeline

	New Delhi, Oct. 19: The government is exploring the possibility of raising the price of gas sold by state-run ONGC Ltd and Oil India Ltd under the administered price mechanism (APM) by 30 per cent. The price is Rs 3,200 per million standard cubic metre now.         
	The petroleum ministry has proposed the move, but the power and fertiliser ministries along with the user companies are not in favour of the plan. The finance ministry supports the move.        
	The government decides the price of gas sold from the fields run by ONGC and Oil India as these were awarded to the companies on a nomination basis.        
	However, gas in the Northeast will continue to be cheaper. The present system of selling gas at 60 per cent of the price for the rest of India will stay.        
	The government will also provide around Rs 150 crore as an annual subsidy to oil companies for selling fuel below cost in the Northeast.         
	The move towards raising the administered prices of the fuel comes after the government approved higher prices for the gas produced from Reliance Industries fields in the Krishna-Godavari basin.         
	Gas is sold under the APM quota mainly to power and fertiliser plants at almost half the current market rates.        
	Officials said gas prices across the country, except in the Northeast, would be aligned to the market rates in a few years.         
	At present, there is a dichotomy as some firms get gas supplies under APM at cheaper rates while others buy at market prices which are higher.        
	The petroleum ministry wants prices under APM to be fixed at Rs 4,140 per million standard cubic metre and then progressively link them to the market rates by 2012-2013.        
	There is also a proposal to set up a gas pool account where money mopped up from the sale of APM gas at market prices as well as from sale at reduced rates will be collected.         
	Losses suffered by oil companies for selling gas under APM at reduced rates will be compensated from this pool till all prices are aligned to the market rates        
	The fertiliser ministry had earlier argued that if the government agreed to increase the price of gas, the already bloated fertiliser subsidy bill would shoot up further.        
	Fertiliser prices are kept low by the government to please the farm lobby. With farmer suicides becoming a nation-wide political issue, it is unlikely that the government will pass on the higher price to the farmers.        
	However, officials indicated that the prices would have to be hiked as the current rates fixed for fertiliser and power utilities were too low.

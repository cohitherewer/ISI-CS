The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | High deficit puts strain on rating
                                                                                                               High deficit puts strain on rating
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Mumbai, July 8: Standard amp; Poors (S amp;P) today threatened to downgrade Indias sovereign credit rating unless the country improves its fiscal health.        
	The global rating agency has a BBB- rating on India  the lowest at the investment grade level  with a negative outlook.        
	The warning comes after the budget projected a fiscal deficit of 6.8 per cent of the gross domestic product (GDP) for 2009-10  against 5.5 per cent in Februarys interim budget  which the agency said was within its expectations.        
	However, if one considers state government deficits and off-budget items such as oil and fertiliser bonds, the fiscal deficit is at 12 per cent of GDP.        
	Speaking to The Telegraph from Singapore, Aninda Mitra, a vice- president of Moodys, said a rising deficit would not necessarily result in a downgrade, though they were concerned about high debt.        
	S amp;P revised its outlook on India to negative in February on expectations of a higher deficit.         
	Analysts said that the risk of an immediate downgrade did not loom over India as the richer nations are themselves looking at double-digit deficits.         
	S amp;P said that in the budget there was no significant information on the road map for a fiscal correction.         
	Besides, there were no major tax changes but minor adjustments in the run-up to the introduction of the goods and service tax nationally in April 2010.        
	IMF ups outlook        
	The International Monetary Fund today raised Indias growth forecast to 5.4 per cent for 2009, while it projected the world economy to shrink 1.4 per cent this year.         
	The multilateral lending agency in April had forecast a growth rate of 4.5 per cent for India in 2009.

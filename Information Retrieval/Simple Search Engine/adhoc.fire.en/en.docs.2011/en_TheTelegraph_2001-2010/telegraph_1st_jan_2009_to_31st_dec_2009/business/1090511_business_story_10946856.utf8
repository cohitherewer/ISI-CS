          JAYANTA ROY CHOWDHURY                                                   
	New Delhi, May 10: The finance ministry has asked all other ministries and departments to list the outcomes of the stimulus packages administered by them to revive the economy. A note of the ministry  F(MoF)/Apex Com/2009/109  seeks to know how the stimulus money has been spent by the different departments and the impact of the exercise.        
	The government fears the tax breaks, interest subsidies and even its direct spending have not really fetched it the kind of growth it was looking for.         
	Much of it went to industries which used the breaks to fatten bottomlines. For instance the automobile industry, which got tax breaks and is now demanding more, never cut prices, points out officials.         
	Following the global recession and the consequent slowdown in India, the government had put in place many stimulus measures.        
	It had cut excise duties on almost all products as well as slashed service taxes to rescue manufacturing which had started shrinking. The total cost of the two stimulus packages is being put at 3 per cent of the gross domestic product (GDP). The government also doled out interest subsidies to exporters hit by the recession and cajoled the Reserve Bank to cut key policy interest rates from a peak of 9 per cent in October last year to the current 4.75 per cent.         
	The fears are being partially borne out by the report cards being sent by some of the ministries. The revival of growth seen in cement, steel sectors and consumer durables is being seen as more a result of infrastructure spending and strong rural demand caused by good winter crops than of the stimulants.        
	According to officials, Fiscal stimulus and interest rate cuts have had a limited impact in boosting growth. Tax cuts reduce government finances, forcing more borrowing and higher inflation.         
	We are increasingly coming round to the belief that old fashioned spending on infrastructure paid for by modest tax structures is the best way of creating jobs and boosting demand while maintaining fiscal discipline, they said.         
	Last week RBI governor D. Subbarao said as much at a book release function, stating we need to think about managing inflationary expectations about the medium-term consequences of policy actions in the economy.         
	Officials calculate that the government can spend another percentage of GDP, or about Rs 54,000 crore, to stimulate the economy but will like to work out its arithmetic properly before announcing any spending programme. It prefers spending plans to be balanced by moves to suck out excess money from the system as, otherwise, inflation may again inch up.         
	The report cards that are coming in also show that the money for reviving the economy quite often gets stuck in the pipeline. Highway projects are being implemented at a slow pace, while the funds for urban renewal, including expenditure on new fleets of buses, are yet to be spent.         
	Interest subsidies meant to help exporters to get more orders were often spent on reducing their interest liability.

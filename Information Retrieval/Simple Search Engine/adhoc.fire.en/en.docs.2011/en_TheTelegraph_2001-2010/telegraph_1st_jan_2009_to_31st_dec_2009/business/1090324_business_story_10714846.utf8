The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Slowdown pinches overseas borrowing
                                                                                                               Slowdown pinches overseas borrowing

	New Delhi, March 23: External commercial borrowings have almost halved to $17.02 billion in the last calendar year from $33.33 billion in 2007, according to Assocham.        
	High global interest rates and a liquidity crunch have caused the slide.        
	Bankers involved in raising money for top companies said liquidity in the international market was still restrictive and available on very hard terms. The mark-up in some cases is about 900 points over Libor (a benchmark rate), which makes it very difficult for companies to raise money, said one banker who is raising funds for two Indian companies.         
	According to Standard and Poors analyst Takahira Ogawa, At this stage, it is very difficult not only for the companies in emerging markets but also in the developed countries to raise funds in the international market because of the lack of liquidity and uncertainty in the global financial and capital markets and economy.        
	 Last month, credit rating agency Standard and Poors lowered the outlook on Indias debt to negative, putting the countrys rating at the risk of being cut to junk.        
	Analysts said the change of outlook attached on Indias sovereign debt might add to the cost of overseas borrowing for domestic companies.

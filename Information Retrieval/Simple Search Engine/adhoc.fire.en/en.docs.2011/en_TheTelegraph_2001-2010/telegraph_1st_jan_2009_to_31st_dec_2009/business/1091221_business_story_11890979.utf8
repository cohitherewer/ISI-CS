	New Delhi, Dec. 20 (PTI): Growth in the services sector, led by an over 20 per cent jump in the wireless and broadband subscriber base, gained momentum during the April-October period this year against the same period last year, a survey by the Confederation of Indian Industry said.        
	The survey was based on the responses from 350 firms.        
	Around 12 per cent of the services sector, including wireless and broadband subscribers and asset under management firms, registered a growth rate of over 20 per cent against 12.5 per cent last year.        
	Services such as foreign exchange earnings, franchising, life insurance premium, housing finance, education and training came under the high growth category of 10-20 per cent.

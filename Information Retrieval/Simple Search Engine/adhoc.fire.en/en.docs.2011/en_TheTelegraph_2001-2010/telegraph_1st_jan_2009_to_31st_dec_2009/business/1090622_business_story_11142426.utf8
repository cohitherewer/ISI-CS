The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | TCS staff feel variable pain
                                                                                                               TCS staff feel variable pain
          SOUNAK MITRA                              
	Calcutta, June 21: Tata Consultancy Services, the countrys largest software exporter, has slashed its employees variable pay for the January-March quarter  a move triggered by the compulsion to tamp down on costs in an uncertain working environment.        
	TCS employees were told recently that the variable will not be paid for the fourth quarter of 2008-09.                     
	The variable pay ranges between 22 per cent and 35 per cent of an employees gross salary and is paid in two parts; half of it is paid every month along with the salary and the other half at the end of the quarter.        
	We received the monthly component of the variable pay along with our salaries. But after the company declared its fourth quarter results on April 20, we were told that we wouldnt get the quarterly component of the variable pay, said an employee.        
	TCS has over 126,000 employees on its rolls  and the cuts will apply across all the business segments.        
	A variable is a variable. It is not a 100 per cent commitment, a TCS spokesperson said over the phone from Mumbai.         
	The variable, which TCS pays after each quarter, is based on the performance of the company as well as the employee during the quarter, he said.        
	The spokesperson believed the cut was no big deal. There has been a cut of about three per cent in an employees variable to be paid annually. Over 90 per cent of the TCS employees have got over 95 per cent of their variable for the financial year 2008-09, he said.        
	Future worries        
	Employees are, however, worried that theres no assurance that the cut will be restored in the next quarter, which ends on June 30.        
	We have no idea about what will happen after the first quarter. We will get to know only after the company announces its first-quarter results for 2009-10, said an employee.        
	The future doesnt look too good. In the fourth quarter, the core business actually shrank 7 per cent quarter-on-quarter if one leaves out the $71-million contribution of Citigroups captive BPO in India (now called TCS e-Serve)  a point that chief operating officer N. Chandrasekaran admitted in a conference call with analysts on April 20.         
	The big worry is that existing clients in the US which have seen their revenues fall during the global downturn  may step up pricing pressure, impacting TCS revenues and margins in the next quarter.         
	It is difficult to predict whether we will have volume growth (in the next few months), CEO-designate Chandrasekaran had said during the interaction with analysts.        
	Tackling downturn         
	An internal letter circulated among TCS employees said the decision to trim the variable payouts was part of the companys cost-saving measures that had been prompted by the need to tackle the effects of the global financial downturn and the comparatively poor performance in the January-March quarter.        
	TCS reported a seven per cent year-on-year increase in net profit during the quarter at Rs 1,333 crore against Rs 1,245 crore in the year-ago period.         
	However, net profit fell 2.1 per cent from the third quarter profits of Rs 1,362 crore.        
	On February 26, TCS chief executive and managing director S. Ramadorai said in Calcutta that the company was reviewing the payment of the employees variable component.         
	He added that there would be no salary hikes in 2009-10. TCS had earlier restructured the variable component in the second quarter of 2008-09. The third quarter variable was paid in full, an employee said.        
	Meanwhile, the company has also withdrawn the subsidised bus services it used to offer to its employees in Calcutta. The buses are still there. But the subsidy is gone. So, we are paying the full charges for the last few months, employees said.        
	During 2008-09, the total employee costs at TCS rose to Rs 11,676.34 crore from Rs 9,413.05 crore in 2007-08.        
	The increase is primarily attributed to the increase in headcount and increase in compensation package, particularly in India, the annual report said.         
	During 2008-09, the employees got a hike of 10-15 per cent across all verticals, the spokesperson said.        
	The total pay of the companys top management and board of directors rose over Rs 1 crore during 2008-09, according to a TCS annual report.        
	Shareholders of the company have also been rewarded with a dividend of Rs 14 per share and a 1:1 bonus  only the second time the company is paying a bonus since its IPO in 2004.

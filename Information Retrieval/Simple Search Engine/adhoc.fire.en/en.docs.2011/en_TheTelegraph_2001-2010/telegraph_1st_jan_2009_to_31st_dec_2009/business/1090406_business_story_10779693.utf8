                                                                                                               Satyam bid to publish results
                              HORROR SHOW                            
	New Delhi, April 5 (PTI): Satyam Computer Services, which is in the process of restating its accounts following the admission of an accounting fraud by disgraced promoter B. Ramalinga Raju, has sought the Company Law Boards (CLB) approval to publish its third-quarter results.        
	We have written to the CLB on third-quarter results and (are) awaiting their response. There is no timeline yet on the restatement of accounts, the company spokesperson said.        
	The cleaning up or restatement of Satyams accounts is expected to come in July as the newly-appointed audit firms will have to scrutinise the companys fudged numbers starting from 2002, according to a source in the company.        
	Meanwhile, the Enforcement Directorate (ED) has registered a case against the company and Ramalinga Raju for alleged money laundering.        
	The ED has claimed to have found prima facie evidence against Raju and others of violating the Prevention of Money Laundering Act. The CBI will file a charge sheet against Raju and others accused in the Satyam scam on April 9.         
	Sources alleged that Raju had diverted Satyams funds to purchase nearly 50 plots at Medchal and Qutbullahpur near Hyderabad.        
	Meanwhile Satyam Computers former CFO Vadlamani Srinivas today told accounting body ICAI that Ramalinga Raju and his brother Rama Raju were the masterminds behind the multi-crore accounting fraud. He admitted before the two-member team of the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (ICAI) that the fraud was going on for the last four to five years.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | SAIL opts for debt
                                                                                                               SAIL opts for debt
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                          Roongta: Cash course                                  
	New Delhi, July 17: Steel Authority of India Limited (SAIL) today said it would borrow Rs 5,000 crore in the current financial year to partially fund its expansion plans.        
	We will borrow to finance our capital expenditure this fiscal. It could be through long-term debt. Well borrow at least 50 per cent of our capex of about Rs 10,000 crore, said S.K Roongta, chairman of SAIL.        
	On whether the public sector steel behemoth was considering a follow-on public offer to raise funds, Roongta declined to comment.         
	SAIL wants to increase its hot metal capacity to 26 million tonnes by 2012 from 15 million tonnes at an investment of around Rs 78,000 crore.        
	The expansion cost has come down from the highs of last year, Roongta said without giving any figure.         
	Last year, the cost of SAILs capacity expansion had touched Rs 90,000 crore as equipment makers revised their rates upwards.        
	Sources say the company will either go for a follow-on public offer or a qualified institutional placement to raise funds.         
	The company has already held preliminary discussions with investment bankers.

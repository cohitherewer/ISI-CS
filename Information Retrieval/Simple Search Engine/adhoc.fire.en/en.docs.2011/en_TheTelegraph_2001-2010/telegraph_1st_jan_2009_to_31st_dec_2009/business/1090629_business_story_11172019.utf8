The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Hotels clamour for infrastructure status
                                                                                                               Hotels clamour for infrastructure status

	New Delhi, June 28: The tourism industry has sought infrastructure status for hotels, tax sops for restaurants and a uniform road tax on tourist vehicles in the budget.        
	According to a blueprint prepared by the ministry of tourism, one of the top demands is the inclusion of hotels within infrastructure under Section 801A of the income tax act, along with airports, sea ports and the railways.        
	Sources in the ministry said if this was allowed, new projects would be able to get full tax deduction on profits for 10 years.        
	The industry has also sought a uniform road tax on tourist vehicles.         
	Transporters say tourism is subjected to a great disparity in taxation.        
	Sarab Jit Singh, president of the Indian Tourist Transporters Association, said, A cess or surcharge may be imposed on fuel to compensate the revenue loss of the state.        
	The hospitality industry, which has been demanding infrastructure status, said de-linking the sector from real estate would help it to access easier credit. The industry has also sought a special package linking it to small and medium enterprises for priority lending.        
	At present, the Reserve Bank of India classifies loans to the sector as a commercial real estate exposure, resulting in higher interest rates and non-priority status for financial assistance.        
	However, analysts said this alone would not be enough to ensure easier access to credit. Ultimately, bankers would only take a call based on the strength of the borrower and all these things will not necessarily increase the flow of credit, said analyst C.V. Prasad.         
	A 10-year tax holiday for new hotel projects in the country is another priority of the industry.

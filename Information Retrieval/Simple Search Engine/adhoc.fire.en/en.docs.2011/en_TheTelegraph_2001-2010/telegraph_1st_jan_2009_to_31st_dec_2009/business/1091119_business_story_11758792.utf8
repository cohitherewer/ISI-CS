          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Calcutta, Nov. 18: Calcutta High Court has cleared the decks for a divestment in power generator DPSC Ltd through an auction.         
	Public sector Andrew Yule and two government-owned insurance companies will put their combined 57 per cent holding on the block this Friday. The name of the highest bidder will be known on the same day.        
	The auction, an unusual route for the divestment of a government stake, will give interested parties multiple chances to outbid others.        
	One of the senior advocates, S.K. Gupta or Ahin Chowdhury, will oversee the auction, Justice Girish Chandra Gupta said.        
	Descon, the largest shareholder of DPSC, had moved Calcutta High Court after a Company Law Board order allowed only Descon to take part in an auction along with the highest bidder but imposed a rider.         
	The CLB had said Descon could participate in the auction only if the difference between its bid and that of the highest bidder was not more than 10 per cent.        
	The highest bidder was to be selected through a close bidding, involving all the interested parties.         
	The court today removed the 10-per-cent clause and allowed all parties to the auction.         
	We are happy with the order as it has given an equal opportunity to all the bidders, including Descon, to pick up the stake. We expect the highest possible price through the process, Andrew Yule chairman Kallol Datta said.        
	Descon managing director S. Radhakrishnan, who is also the MD of DPSC (formerly Dishergarh Power Supply Co), said he was happy with the order. It is fine with us. We will go ahead, he said.        
	In divestment, interested parties submit sealed tenders and whoever bids the highest clinches the deal. Here, bidders will have multiple chances to outbid others. Sajjan Jindals JSW Energy, R.P. Goenkas CESC, Sanjay Budhias Patton, Srei-led IPCL, Pawan Ruias Raghab Industries and Descon are expected to participate in the auction.

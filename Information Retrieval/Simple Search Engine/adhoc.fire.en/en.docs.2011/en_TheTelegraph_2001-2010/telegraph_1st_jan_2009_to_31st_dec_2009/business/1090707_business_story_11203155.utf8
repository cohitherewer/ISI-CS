The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | A balanced approach to core growth
                                                                                                               A balanced approach to core growth

	I give a thumbs up to Pranab Mukherjees budget for 2009-10. The strategy has been crafted in a balanced manner, while giving impetus to infrastructure growth and rationalising the taxation structure.        
	As promised, the government has delivered on the infrastructure front.         
	It is commendable that the government has increased allocations substantially for the NHAI (up 23 per cent) and the JNNURM, where the allocation is higher by a whopping 80 pre cent. The measures reiterate the governments commitment to infrastructure reforms.        
	The finance minister has also stated that take out financing will solve the asset liability mismatch on bank balance sheets due to the long-term nature of loans to the infrastructure sector. The government SPV set up for infrastructure development, IIFCL, will refinance 60 per cent of the infrastructure loans extended by banks for PPP (public-private partnership) infrastructure projects.         
	A reasonable attempt has been made to rationalise the direct tax structure. Fringe benefit tax (FBT) has been abolished and surcharge has been removed. It is not clear as to how much tax will be saved because of this move since FBT appears to have been replaced with perquisite tax.         
	Clearly, the fiscal deficit has kept market participants worried. While the expectation was 6.2 per cent, the actual figure at 6.8 per cent was unexpectedly higher.         
	This leads us to speculate on the direction of medium-term interest rates. At present, interest rates are drifting lower, with banks cutting deposit and lending rates.         
	An excess of government paper in the market is likely to create some sort of upward pressure on interest rates going forward.        
	What disappointed the capital market was the non-articulation of the steps to be taken to reconcile government finances. Though the finance minister has categorically stated that divestment in public sector enterprises will be the governments priority, he has not elaborated on the road map for the process.

	New Delhi, April 6: Investment in PCs, servers and peripherals is likely to decrease 20-40 per cent in 2009, an industry study said.        
	The economic slowdown is accelerating enterprise transformation, manifested in cost savings and productivity enhancement, said a study conducted by IDC India, a software consultancy firm.        
	Instead of building new IT capacities, companies in India are focusing on better management of existing IT infrastructure by consolidating, optimising and leveraging resources, said Kapil Dev Singh, IDC India country manager.        
	Of the total planned IT expenditure for 2009, enterprises plan to spend 20 per cent on new purchases and reserve the balance for managing the existing set-up, he said.         
	Technology researcher Gartner said IT spending would grow only 5.5 per cent in 2009, a drop by more than half.        
	Computer sales have been impacted by restrained demand from the retail, IT and small and medium enterprises due to concerns over liquidity and general economic performance. Consumption in households is also muted, said Vinnie Mehta, executive director of Manufacturers Association of Information Technology.        
	PC maker Dell also expects to see slowdown in spending by large enterprises.         
	There will be a slight slowdown in IT budget in the enterprises segment in India. But they still have to spend on IT, said Sameer Garde, Dell India country general manager.        
	Singh said companies expected the slowdown to be over by December.         
	However, the demand for IT products would pick up only from April-June 2010.

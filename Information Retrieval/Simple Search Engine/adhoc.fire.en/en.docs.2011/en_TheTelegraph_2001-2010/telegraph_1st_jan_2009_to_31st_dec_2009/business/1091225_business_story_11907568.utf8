The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Maharatna status for select PSUs
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Maharatna status for select PSUs
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                            
	New Delhi, Dec. 24: The government today granted certain public sector firms more financial and operational autonomy to acquire assets, set up joint ventures and become globally competitive.        
	The main objective of the Maharatna scheme is to empower mega state-run firms such as SAIL, ONGC and NTPC to expand their operations and emerge as global giants, information and broadcasting minister Ambika Soni said after a meeting of the Union cabinet presided by Prime Minister Manmohan Singh.        
	The government, however, did not provide a list of state-run companies to be accorded the Maharatna status. Of the 18 Navaratnas, SAIL, ONGC and NTPC are likely to meet the stiff criteria set by the government, including an average annual profit of Rs 5,000 crore, average turnover of Rs 25,000 crore and average net worth of Rs 15,000 crore  all over the last three years.        
	The company should be listed on the bourses and have a significant global presence.        
	This is a huge encouragement and recognition of our performance. This will boost our plans of acquisition and help in speedy investment decisions, R.S. Sharma, chairman and managing director of ONGC, said.        
	The status empowers the boards of these firms to take investment decisions up to Rs 5,000 crore against the present Rs 1,000-crore-limit without seeking government approval.        
	The PSUs which have the potential to become Indian multinational companies can be recognised as a separate class as Maharatnas, Soni said. The Maharatna firms would now be free to decide on investments up to 15 per cent of their net worth in a project, limited to an absolute ceiling of Rs 5,000 crore. Earlier, the navaratna companies could invest up to Rs 1,000 crore without government approvals.        
	However, the overall ceiling on such equity investments and mergers and acquisitions in all projects put together will not exceed 30 per cent of net worth of the state-run units, Soni said.        
	U.D. Choubey, director-general of the Standing Conference of Public Enterprises (SCOPE), said: Efficiency of the companies should not be just based on the net turnover and corresponding net profit because there may be companies which have less turnover but higher profits.        
	The proposed higher category will act as an incentive for other navaratna companies, provide brand value and facilitate delegation of enhanced powers to the central public sector enterprises, the government said.        
	The government had introduced the navaratna scheme in 1997 to identify state-run firms that had comparative advantages over others and needed autonomy and support to become global giants.        
	The boards of these firms have been delegated powers in capital expenditure, investment in joint ventures or subsidiaries, mergers and human resources management.

                                                                                                               Credit flow to get priority
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Cabinet secretary K.M. Chandrasekhar (extreme left) along with other officials in New Delhi on Saturday. (PTI)                                  
	New Delhi, Jan. 31: The government is likely to announce a third stimulus package in the third week of February. This time the package will address sector-specific issues and focus on measures to ease credit flow to industry. However, tax sops will not be a part of the package.        
	The non-fiscal measures will be announced in the third week of February before the election code comes into play, commerce secretary G.K. Pillai said.        
	This is the first time that a senior bureaucrat has hinted at the timing of the third stimulus package.        
	The government will consider several sector-specific issues that had not been addressed in the previous two packages announced between December and January.        
	Cabinet secretary K.M. Chandrasekhar along with the chief secretaries of state governments and top officials of key economic ministries today took stock of the progress being made in the implementation of the stimulus measures announced over the past two months.        
	Chandrasekhar said the government was considering non-fiscal steps as the finances of the government are overstretched. He urged the states to focus on large-scale housing projects, coordinate with banks to ensure smooth credit flow to industry and encourage easy payments to small units.

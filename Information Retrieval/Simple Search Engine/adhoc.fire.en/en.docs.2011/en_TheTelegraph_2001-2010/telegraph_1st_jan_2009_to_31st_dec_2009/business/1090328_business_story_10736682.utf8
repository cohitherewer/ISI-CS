The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Recovery hint in core growth
                                                                                                               Recovery hint in core growth
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, March 27: Core industries grew 2.2 per cent in February against 1.4 per cent in January, holding out a faint hope of economic recovery. However, the growth was poor compared to the year-ago level of 7 per cent.        
	The data show some kind of recovery in the core sectors, suggesting that the stimulus measures are starting to have an impact, N.R. Bhanumurthy of the Institute of Economic Growth said.        
	However, he said, a turnaround can only be confirmed if the growth is sustained in the next two months.        
	Output growth in the six key industries  crude, petroleum refinery products, coal, electricity, cement and finished steel  during the April-February period of this fiscal was 3 per cent against 5.8 per cent a year ago.        
	According to D.K. Joshi, principal economist with Crisil, the core sector was performing in line with overall industrial production.        
	Exports flat        
	Exports may post a near-flat growth of $170-175 billion in the next fiscal, but job losses in export-oriented industries are expected to slow down, commerce secretary G. K. Pillai said today. I think by April end there will be no more job losses, he said.        
	The World Trade Organization has forecast a drop of 9 per cent in world trade during 2009. In this backdrop, we may see total exports hovering around $170-billion in 2009-10, he said.        
	Exports in the current fiscal are likely to be $170 billion, lower than the revised target. In 2007-08, exports grew over 25 per cent and stood at nearly $162 billion.        
	We will be lucky if we touch the $170 billion target for the current fiscal. This means a growth of roughly about 3-4 per cent, Pillai said.        
	The government has given exporters sops such as an interest subsidy in its three stimulus packages.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      Goel: Growth mantra                          
	Calcutta, July 30: Uco Bank is set to foray into non-life insurance through a joint venture.        
	We hope to finalise the memorandum of understanding for the joint venture by September this year, chairman and managing director S.K. Goel said while announcing the Calcutta-based banks financial results for the first quarter of the current financial year.        
	According to a senior official of the bank, a sub-committee of the board of directors has appointed a consultant to look for a foreign partner for the non-life joint venture.        
	There will be four partners. Besides Uco Bank and the foreign partner, there could be another public sector bank and a non-banking company, he added.         
	Uco will hold a 36 per cent stake in the non-life entity, while another 26 per cent will go to the foreign partner. The remaining 38 per cent will be shared between the two domestic partners, who are yet to be finalised.        
	Uco today reported a 34 per cent growth in net profit at Rs 178.85 crore in the first quarter of the current financial year. Total business grew a little over 26 per cent to Rs 1,68,808 crore.         
	Deposits grew 28.37 per cent to Rs 1,00,428 crore, while advances went up 22.71 per cent to Rs 68,380 crore.        
	A slowdown in the banks overseas business ate into its domestic performance.         
	However, we are aiming the banks total business to grow to Rs 2,02,000 crore by the end of the current financial year, Goel said.        
	UBI profit        
	The United Bank of India (UBI) has reported a 65 per cent increase in net profit at Rs 70.28 crore for the first quarter of 2009-10 against the corresponding period last fiscal.        
	UBI chief S. C. Gupta said the growth in net profit was because of a 158 per cent rise in non-interest income.

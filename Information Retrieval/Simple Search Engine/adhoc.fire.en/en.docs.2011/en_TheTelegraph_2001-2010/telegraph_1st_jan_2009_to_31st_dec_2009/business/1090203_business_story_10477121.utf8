          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Mumbai, Feb. 2: Hit hard by the global economic slowdown, Mastek Ltd has decided to give 425 employees a forced break by placing them on a virtual bench.        
	The mid-sized IT company said the employees on the bench would receive a monthly allowance for 12 months. They have also been given the option to leave the company with a compensation package.        
	Mastek told the bourses that it had experienced a demand slowdown in the last quarter. With a lower level of attrition, it had ended up with a surplus of 425 professionals. Most of them are trainees.        
	The company said the employees could remain on the virtual bench for a maximum period of 12 months, during which they can leverage the companys learning and development facilities to upgrade their skills and competencies. These employees, it said, can return to a full-time role when suitable opportunities arose.        
	Mastek is implementing other cost-cutting measures to trim expenditure. It plans to reduce travel costs and scale down other forms of spending.        
	These are tough times and market uncertainties are compelling us to take steps that are unprecedented in our 26-year history, said chairman and managing director Sudhakar Ram.

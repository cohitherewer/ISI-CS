                                                                                                               South Indian Bank aims big
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Thariyan: Growth focus                                  
	Calcutta, Sept. 20: The Kerala-based South Indian Bank is aiming at achieving a nearly four-fold increase in net profit in the next four years.         
	We have set a net profit target of Rs 750 crore by 2013, said Abraham Thariyan, executive director of the PSU bank. By then, we plan to grow our business to Rs 75,000 crore and employ 7,500 people, he said.        
	The bank clocked a net profit of Rs 194.75 crore in 2008-09 and expects to increase this to 18 per cent to Rs 230 crore at the end of the current fiscal. We are targeting a total business of Rs 36,000 crore by the end of 2009-10, Thariyan said.        
	However, with comfortable levels of low-cost deposits (33 per cent of total deposits), capital adequacy ratio (15.07 per cent under Basel II) and 0.68 per cent net non-performing assets, the bank is well placed to expand its lending business.         
	Tier-I capital (primarily equity and retained profits) comprises 13.71 per cent of the banks capital adequacy, which doesnt include the Rs 200 crore it has raised recently as Tier-II (debt) capital. We have a very comfortable CAR and dont need to raise further capital at this moment, though we have enough room in Tier-II, he said.         
	To bring down its cost of deposits further and enhance the net interest margin level, now at 3.11 per cent, the bank is focussing on low-cost resource mobilisation.         
	In a couple of weeks, well raise Rs 300 crore through certificate of deposits, Thariyan said. Deposits of less than one year are called certificate of deposits (CD), and currently the interest rate on one-year CDs are ruling below 6 per cent. Generally, mutual funds, pension funds and corporations with high cash levels park their funds in these deposits.        
	The bank has also launched a savings product called Mahila Savings Bank amp; Recurring Deposit Accounts for women depositors. It offers free personal accident insurance of Rs 1 lakh and house-to-house travel insurance of Rs 50,000 in the first year, provided the depositor maintains a minimum balance of Rs 1,000 in the savings bank account and a minimum 12-month recurring deposit of Rs 100 per month. For this scheme, South Indian Bank has joined hands with United India Insurance.         
	In the case of any misfortune, the depositor will have to make a first information report with the nearest police station at the place of incident and produce the copy of the FIR at the bank, he said.

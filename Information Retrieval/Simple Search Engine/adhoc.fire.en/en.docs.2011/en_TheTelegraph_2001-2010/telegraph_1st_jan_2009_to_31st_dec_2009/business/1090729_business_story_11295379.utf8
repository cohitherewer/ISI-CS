          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Pranab Mukherjee in New Delhi on Tuesday. (PTI)                                  
	New Delhi, July 28: Finance minister Pranab Mukherjee today told the Rajya Sabha that the Congress-led government would sell minority stakes in state-run companies once the stock market indices improved.         
	However, the government made it clear that PSUs that have received navratna status were not being considered for divestment.         
	Other PSUs would be considered for minority stake sales on a case-by-case basis.         
	The Trinamul Congress and the DMK  major partners in the UPA  have already flagged their concerns about divestment, though they have not called for a halt to it.        
	The governments cautious stand on divestment came on a day it set the price band for the initial public offering of NHPC at Rs 30-36.        
	The NHPC issue, which will open on August 7, is the first since 2006 when the DMK forced the government to halt all divestments. NHPC is targeting Rs 6,048 crore from the issue.        
	PSUs with high profits are under consideration and as soon as markets are in good shape, we will make them public. We want to gain maximum advantage of the markets, once they get back in shape, Mukherjee said in the Upper House.        
	Mukherjee said the disinvestment policy was an ongoing one and was in the common minimum programme of the previous UPA government, too.        
	The policy of the government is to develop people-ownership of PSUs, while ensuring that government equity does not fall below 51 per cent and the government retains management control of the company, the minister said.        
	The Congress-led government was also looking at the possibility of turning the National Investment Fund  where the divestment proceeds are parked  into a pass-through corpus, allowing it to use the entire amount instead of just the returns from the funds.        
	However, the government has put the proposal on the backburner because of opposition from Trinamul.        
	The government may not face any problem if it allows NHPC Limited and Oil India Limited to issue fresh shares or piggybacks on these offers to sell minority stakes in them.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Sebi seal on Satyam sale
                                                                                                               Sebi seal on Satyam sale
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                          
	Mumbai, March 6: The Securities and Exchange Board of India has approved the sale of 51 per cent of beleaguered software firm Satyam Computer Services through an international competitive bidding process.        
	Satyam is expected to commence the exercise next week by issuing an application form for the bidding.        
	Sources said that more details on the bidding, including a possible reserve price, would be known then.        
	The bidding will be for 31 per cent of Satyam, with the winner issued fresh equity shares.        
	Subsequently, the strategic investor will have to make an open offer for another 20 per cent at the price it paid for the 31 per cent stake.        
	If the investor fails to get 20 per cent from the open offer, Satyam can issue fresh shares to enable it to reach the 51-per-cent mark.        
	Besides, the investor will not be able to sell the shares for a period of three years from the date of the acquisition. However, the investor will be able to subscribe to additional equity shares.        
	Satyam also said that bidders were expected to have net assets of more than $150 million.        
	The announcement led to the shares of Satyam surging on the stock exchanges today. On the BSE, it ended 20 per cent higher at Rs 42.10.        
	The bidding process will begin shortly, Deepak Parekh, director of Satyam, told reporters after meeting corporate affairs minister P. C. Gupta in Delhi today.        
	Though Satyam had already got a Sebi relief on some takeover regulations, sources said prospective investors such as Larsen amp; Toubro (L amp;T) would wait for more disclosures before placing a bid.         
	Investors want to not only know how the bidding will be conducted but also, more importantly, want more clarity on Satyams financial position, sources said.         
	The company is facing many class action lawsuits in the US, while auditors KPMG and Deloitte are restating the accounts of the firm for a number of years.        
	L amp;T is now the single largest investor in Satyam with a 12 per cent stake. Chairman A.M. Naik had recently said the company would seek permission from its board for a bid.        
	Apart from L amp;T, the Hindujas and the Spice group have expressed their interest. IBM, reportedly, is also in the fray.        
	Satyam is yet to announce how it will conduct the bidding as observers debate on the e-auction option. Based on todays closing price on the BSE, the company is valued at a little over Rs 2,837 crore.        
	Satyam plunged into a crisis in January when its founder B. Ramalinga Raju confessed to a massive Rs 7,100-crore fraud.         
	Sebi has sent a show cause notice to Price Waterhouse, which audited Satyam, under regulations dealing with fraudulent and unfair trade.        
	According to sources, the market regulator has sent the notice to Price Waterhouse under the Fraudulent and Unfair Trade Practices norms, which prescribe a maximum penalty of Rs 25 crore.

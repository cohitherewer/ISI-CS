The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Petrol, diesel set to turn dearer
                                                                                                               Petrol, diesel set to turn dearer
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, June 22: The government may increase the price of petrol by Rs 2 per litre and diesel by Rs 1 per litre in sync with rising global crude prices that are hovering at $70 a barrel, a senior petroleum ministry official said.         
	However, petroleum minister Murli Deora said, Nothing is on the cards as of now.        
	He said the government was considering deregulating fuel prices. I had said that this would be taken up in four to six weeks and we are still considering it, Deora said.        
	According to the oil ministry official, We have to act to save our PSUs as they have been hit by rising global prices. The burden has to be shared equally by companies, the government and consumers. The Indian basket of crude has averaged $70.49 per barrel in the second fortnight of June against $58 in May.         
	Analysts feel the government may not hike prices before the budget.        
	The oil firms, which began this fiscal on a positive note, are expected to suffer a loss of Rs 50,000 crore this fiscal. They are losing Rs 6 per litre on petrol, Rs 3 on diesel, Rs 12 on kerosene and Rs 70 per domestic LPG cylinder for selling them below cost.        
	The three PSU retailers  IOC, BPCL and HPCL  closed 2008-09 with under-recoveries of Rs 103,908 crore. They have been compensated through government bonds and discounts from upstream firms.         
	Gas price        
	The government is likely to increase the price of natural gas produced by ONGC and Oil India to $4.2 per mmBtu, which is equivalent to the price that Reliance Industries is getting for its KG basin gas over a three-year period.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      Central Bank CMD S. Sridhar in Calcutta on Saturday. A Telegraph picture                                
	Calcutta, May 16: The Central Bank of India will focus on doubling its customer base to five crore to shore up its business and profitability.         
	Inaugurating a model branch here, chairman S. Sridhar said, At present, we have 25 million customers. I want to see this number double to 50 million. For this, we need to focus on providing better customer services at all branches.        
	Sridhar took up the top job in the bank in April this year. Prior to this assignment, Sridhar was the head of the National Housing Bank.         
	The banks net profit fell by half in the January-March quarter to Rs 62.51 crore from the same quarter a year ago.        
	The Central Bank, in which the government owns 80.20 per cent equity, reported a marginal 3.8 per cent increase in net profit for the whole of 2008-09 at Rs 571.24 crore against Rs 550.16 crore a year ago.        
	The banks annual net profit of Rs 571.24 crore covers only half of its net non-performing assets of Rs 1,063.42 crore. Even after restructuring loans worth Rs 1,802.84 crore in 2008-09, the bank had to set aside Rs 511.76 crore compared with Rs 416.36 crore in the previous year. In the January-March quarter alone, the bank made a provisioning of Rs 347.28 crore, of which Rs 268 crore was set aside for NPAs.         
	In fact, there has been very little decline in bad loans in 2008-09 compared with the previous year in absolute terms. Recovery of bad loans will be our top priority in 2009-10, Sridhar said. The new chairman will focus on tightening the recovery cells in Mumbai, Calcutta, Bhopal and Raipur.        
	The Central Banks total business, however, went up to Rs 2,18,012 crore from Rs 1,84,607 crore a year ago, a little more than 18 per cent growth. While deposits grew by 19 per cent to Rs 1,31,272 crore, advances went up by 16.76 per cent. The bank targets a 27 per cent growth in deposits and 24 per cent growth in advances in 2009-10.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Sensex rally takes a break
                                                                                                               Sensex rally takes a break
          OUR BUREAU                                             
	Mumbai, April 28: The sensex snapped a three-day winning streak and declined 370 points on the back of weak global cues and fears of political uncertainty after the general election.        
	The 30-share barometer of the BSE moved in the range of 11375.97 and 10961.76 before closing at 11001.75, a fall of 370.10 points or 3.25 per cent over the previous close.        
	In the previous three sessions, the sensex gained 554.31 points or 5.12 per cent. The 50-issue Nifty of the NSE dipped 107.65 points or 3.10 per cent to 3362.35 from its last close.        
	Brokers attributed the sensex fall to profit-selling ahead of the expiry of derivatives contracts on April 29.         
	The fall in the Asian indices because of weakness on Wall Street on Monday dampened sentiments. The Kospi ended down 2.95 per cent, the Nikkei 2.67 per cent, the Hang Seng 1.92 per cent, and Taiwan 1.90 per cent.

	Calcutta, June 26: The Reserve Bank today said it would continue to ensure that money supply was easy, a hint of further cuts in key rates to spur consumption in the economy.        
	There is plenty of liquidity in the system and we want to assure that it will be maintained, RBI deputy governor Usha Thorat said. A cut in rates would prompt banks to reduce interest rates on loans.        
	The central bank will undertake the quarterly review of its monetary policy on July 28.        
	Meanwhile, the RBI has authorised public sector banks to give more relief to farmers under the debt relief scheme, provided the banks do not ask the government to bear the losses. Farmers were given debt relief to the extent of 25 per cent of their loans, if they paid 75 per cent of their debt.

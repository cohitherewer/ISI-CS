The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Yamaha to double exports
                                                                                                               Yamaha to double exports
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Calcutta, Sept. 23: Yamaha Motor Company plans to double the export of bikes conditioned for India to countries with similar road situations. The company also plans to increase its market share to about 4 per cent this year from 3 per cent in 2008.        
	We have identified some new geographies that hold potential for made-for-India (bikes). The markets include South Asia, South America, Africa and European countries, Yukimine Tsuji, managing director of Yamaha Motor India, said. Road conditions in these regions are similar to India.         
	Yamaha exported 50,000 units in 2007 and just 30,000 units in 2008. This year the company aims to export 70,000 units followed by 1.4 lakh in 2010 and 2 lakh units in 2012.         
	We are planning to export the FZ16 and R15 to Indonesia, the Philippines and Columbia next year. The two bikes are made for India and contain the DNA of Yamahas R1 and FZ models. These will undergo suitable changes for introduction in Europe and the US, Tsuji said.

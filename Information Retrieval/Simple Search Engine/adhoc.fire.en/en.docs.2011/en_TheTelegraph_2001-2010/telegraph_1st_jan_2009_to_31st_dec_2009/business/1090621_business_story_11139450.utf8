                                                                                                               Air India appeal to employees
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, June 20: Air India chairman Arvind Jadhav today wrote to employees asking them to help tackle the current financial crisis.         
	It is a fight for survival, Jadhav said in a message that asked employees to view the current financial crunch being faced by Air India in the global context as the aviation industry worldwide has been passing through turbulent times.         
	He added that an attempt to secure a bailout package from the government might succeed if it agreed to certain tough conditions.        
	Air India has approached the government for infusion of funds both by way of equity and soft loans, Jadhav said. We are hopeful that the government will extend a helping hand soon.         
	However, Jadhav added, As we have seen in the United States, financial help from the government comes with conditions attached. Sources said Air India expects the government to impose cost cutting measures and ask it to delay the purchase of fleet in return for a bailout package.        
	The appeal for help came as the airline started talks with employee unions over plans to delay salary disbursement.

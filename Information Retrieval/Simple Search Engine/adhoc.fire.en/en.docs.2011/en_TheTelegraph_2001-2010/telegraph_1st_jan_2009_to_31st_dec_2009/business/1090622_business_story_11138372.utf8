                                                                                                                 Q amp;A      Land logic
                                I got a vacant plot from my father as gift in 2002 through a registered deed. The valuation of the land was shown as Rs 4.6 lakh in the deed. The registration cost was Rs 9,000. If I sell the land for Rs 7.5 lakh, what will be my capital gains tax? How can I avoid the capital gains tax?          Kartik Ch. Das, Sonarpur
                    To calculate your long-term capital gain, you shall have to first arrive at the cost of acquisition adjusted for the cost inflation index (CII). The cost inflation index for each financial year is notified by the income tax department. Assuming that your father bought the property in 2002-03 and gifted it to you in the same financial year, your indexed cost of acquisition will be Rs (4,60,000 + 9,000) x CII of the year of sale/CII of the year of purchase, i.e., Rs 4,69,000 x 582/447, or Rs 6,10,644. Thus, your long-term capital gains will be Rs 1,39,356 and you will have to pay tax at the rate of 20 per cent of this amount. Now, if you invest Rs 1,39,356 to purchase a residential house within two years from the sale of the land, you dont have to pay any capital gains tax. You can also avoid paying the tax if you invest the money in constructing a residential house within three years from the sale of the land. If you dont want to reinvest the money in a residential property, you can invest the same in bonds specified under Section 54EC capital gains tax saving bonds of the National Highway Authority of India, Rural Electrification Corporation and the National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development.                                  Tax tally      I am less than 65 years of age, a retired government employee and pension holder. Do I need to show my interest income from the bank and post office fixed deposits and monthly income schemes, as other income in the income tax return?        D.K. Dasgupta, Belur
                    If your total annual income, including the interest income from bank and post office fixed deposits, is more than Rs 1.5 lakh, you shall have to file income tax return. In the income tax return, youll have to show interest income under the head other income.

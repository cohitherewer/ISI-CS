The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Grupo ups Asarco bid, Sterlite stays firm
                                                                                                               Grupo ups Asarco bid, Sterlite stays firm
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Calcutta, Aug. 18: Grupo Mexico has raised its offer for Asarco, moving ahead of rival Sterlite Industries in the race to acquire the US copper smelter. Grupo is ready to give $2.2 billion in cash plus a $280 million note.         
	Sterlite, owned by London Stock Exchange- listed Vedanta Resources, had offered $1.71 billion, including $1.58 billion in cash, last week.         
	Vedanta chairman Anil Agarwal subsequently said the company had put in its best bid, and the offer would not be increased any further. He said Sterlite would be fine even if it lost the bid war.        
	In a filing with the US bankruptcy court in Corpus Christi, Texas, Grupo Mexico said its offer would include the full repayment of administrative, priority, secured and asbestos personal injury claims, as well as a full payment of general unsecured claims.        
	The move to offer full repayment to Asarcos creditors could be a turning point for the control of Asarco as any higher bid would mean repayment to the Asarco shareholders, and Grupo Mexico already owns 100 per cent of Asarcos shares.        
	Grupo had bought Asarco in a leveraged buyout but lacked board control. The Tuscan, Arizona-based company filed for bankruptcy in 2005, and Grupo lost control over Asarco.        
	The reorganisation plans proposed by Sterlite and Grupo to revive Asarco are being heard by judge Richard Schimdt at the bankruptcy court of Corpus Christi, Texas.        
	The present management of Asarco has so far supported the plan submitted by Sterlite.        
	The workers of Asarco do not want Grupo at the helm as they claim the Mexican company had stripped Asarco, already saddled with environmental claims, of its assets and pushed it towards bankruptcy.

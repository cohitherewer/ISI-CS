The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | African rules a headache
                                                                                                               African rules a headache
          OUR BUREAU                              
	May 26: The Bharti-MTN deal could run into regulatory hurdles in South Africa though it conforms to foreign investment norms in India.        
	South Africas powerful trade union COSATU, which carries a lot of clout with President Jacob Zuma, has said there are worrying aspects about the deal and that it is looking at the terms of engagement very closely.        
	COSATU nearly derailed Vodafones takeover of MTN rival Vodacom earlier this month, industry analysts said.        
	Other hurdles include the affirmative action policy in South Africa, which requires companies to vest at least 25 per cent of their equity and 40 to 50 per cent of their management control in people of African origin.        
	Some analysts also questioned the synergies of the deal and the restrictions on repatriation of profits in African countries.        
	A report by Kotak Institutional Equities Research said, We see few synergy benefits in a potential MTN acquisition. We presume that both the companies will be equally efficient in operations and negotiations for equipment purchases given the impressive return ratios and profitability. We do not see meaningful strategic objectives other than achieving global aspirations of the company (Bharti Airtel).        
	Analysts also said MTN faced restrictions in its home markets on repatriation of cash flows back to the parent. These restrictions reflect in high cash balance of MTN  cash balance of $3.8 billion and debt of $5.3 billion in end-December 2008, said the Kotak report.        
	MTN has operations in countries like Congo, Iran, Sudan and Afghanistan, countries where the political risks tend to be on the higher side and this is another potential challenge that Bharti may face, Angel Broking said in a report.        
	Bharti Airtel, however, insisted the deal would face no hurdles at home.        
	Foreign direct investment in Bharti Airtel will remain within the sectoral cap of 74 per cent, a spokesman for Bharti Airtel said.        
	Under the new rules framed in February, foreign equity up to 99 per cent is allowed through the indirect route.         
	As a result, a 36 per cent economic interest (or the sum of direct and indirect equity holding in a company) in MTNs favour can be easily accommodated, Bharti said.        
	Bharti Airtel had close to 70 per cent foreign equity stake under the old guidelines  where beneficial ownership is interpreted to include indirect holding. Under the new rules, the foreign stake is close to 43 per cent.         
	This is because a significant part of SingTels 31 per cent holding in the company as well as Vodafones entire stake are routed through majority-owned Indian companies.

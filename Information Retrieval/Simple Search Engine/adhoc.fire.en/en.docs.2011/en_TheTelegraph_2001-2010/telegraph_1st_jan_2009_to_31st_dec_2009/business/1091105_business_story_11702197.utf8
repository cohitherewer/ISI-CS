          OUR CORRESPONDENT                      Raja: Cautious                           
	New Delhi, Nov. 4: The government wants to beef up the manufacture of telecom equipment in India to allay security concerns over the use of foreign devices.        
	A core group, comprising senior officials of the department of telecom (DoT), will be formed in the next two to three weeks to promote and oversee localisation of telecom equipment manufacturing in the country, telecom minister A. Raja said after meeting the heads of mobile equipment manufacturers here today.         
	The group will be headed by DoT secretary P.J. Thomas.        
	Analysts said the move would help security agencies keep a tab on the telecom equipment being used in sensitive border and insurgency-hit areas.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Maytas lenders seek govt cover
                                                                                                               Maytas lenders seek govt cover
          JAYATI GHOSE                              
	New Delhi, Feb. 19: Banks want the government to protect their loans and guarantees to Maytas Infra. They are apprehensive that Maytas, promoted by the Raju family, may see a change in the management as it gets embroiled in the Satyam scam.         
	The banks, both Indian and foreign, are worried that Maytass clients will terminate their contracts.         
	The government should try to ensure that the clients of Maytas do not cancel contracts midway and that Maytas Infra completes the projects within the stipulated time to protect our investments in the company, said a senior banker.        
	A consortium of 19 banks, which includes the countrys two largest lenders  the State Bank of India and ICICI Bank  have lent over Rs 5,000 crore to Maytas.         
	Most of the exposure is in guarantees, which cannot be invoked if Maytas collapses for no fault of its own. This is of some relief to the banks. A guarantee is a pledge made by a third party to repay a loan which a borrower cannot.        
	Loans to Maytas will be affected if orders are cancelled. ICICI Bank has the largest exposure to the firm. This includes both fund-based and non fund-based exposures, including guarantees, said officials of the RBI.         
	The SBI has an exposure of about Rs 500 crore in Maytas Infra and Maytas Properties, which is an unlisted real estate developer.        
	Other financial institutions that have lent to Maytas include IDBI Bank (Rs 300 crore), Indian Overseas Bank (over Rs 90 crore) and the Central Bank of India (Rs 49 crore).        
	Last week, Maytas Infras lenders moved Andhra Pradesh High Court to stop clients of the company from invoking bank guarantees.

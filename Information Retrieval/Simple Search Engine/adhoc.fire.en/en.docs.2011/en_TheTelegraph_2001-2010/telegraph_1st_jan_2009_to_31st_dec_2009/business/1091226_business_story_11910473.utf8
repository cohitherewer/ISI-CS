The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | RIL ready to up Lyondell offer
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      RIL ready to up Lyondell offer
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                            
	Mumbai, Dec. 25: Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL) has decided to aggressively pursue its bid for bankrupt petrochemicals maker LyondellBasell (LB)  and will even consider the option of raising its non-binding cash bid of $12 billion announced on November 21.        
	The move comes at a time when the existing management of LyondellBasell has submitted a reorganisation plan to a bankruptcy court even as it termed RILs offer as way too low.        
	Sources said the Mukesh Ambani-controlled company, which is seeking to gain scale by buying one of the worlds largest petrochemicals company, might now up the ante on two counts.         
	First, it could consider raising the offer price for LB  estimated at around $12 billion  especially since the existing management had predicted that the company could achieve a turnover of around $30 billion next year after the reorganisation, said sources.        
	This is typical of negotiations and RIL was definitely not going to offer the best price in the initial stages, said a Mumbai-based investment banker.         
	Second, RIL may increase the cash component of the transaction. Unconfirmed reports indicate that RILs non-binding offer of $12 billion includes a cash infusion of around $2 billion. Sources said the cash portion of the deal could be increased to $5-6 billion if RIL was keen to remain in the fray.        
	A spokesperson for RIL declined to comment on the developments.        
	The cash component of the offer has become significant as the existing management has proposed a $2.8-billion rights issue to help the company to emerge from bankruptcy. Apollo Management, an affiliate of Access Industries and Ares Corporate Opportunities Fund, will backstop the rights offer.         
	The reorganisation plan submitted by the LyondellBasell management also includes creditor support to convert $18 billion of debt into equity.         
	Sources said RIL was also enthused by the support that it had received from the unsecured lenders of LB.         
	There are two ways forward for RIL  garner support from the warring lenders faction and up the price of the offer, said an analyst.         
	Reports in the international media indicate unsecured lenders of LB are seeking an investigation by a court- appointed examiner to ensure that bids from other suitors are evaluated fairly and that interested bidders such as RIL are considered along with the reorganisation plan submitted by the companys owners and creditors Access Industries, Ares Management and Apollo Management LP.         
	The LB management has indicated that the reorganisation plan, which hinges on the conversion of $18 billion of debt into equity, does not eliminate RIL as a potential suitor for LB.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | RBI builds base for new rate regime 
                                                                                                               RBI builds base for new rate regime 
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                        
	Mumbai, Oct. 20: A Reserve Bank of India panel has recommended the replacement of the benchmark prime lending rate (BPLR) of banks with a base rate to remove the rigidities and lack of transparency in the pricing of loans.        
	The base rate, which can be used by banks as a benchmark for floating rate loans, is the bare minimum rate below which it will not be viable for banks to lend.        
	The panel was set up following repeated petitions to the RBI to change the BPLR system. Competition had resulted in most loans being given below BPLR, undermining its role as a reference rate.        
	Moreover, there were complaints about banks using internal and non-transparent norms in fixing rates with reference to the BPLR.        
	Banks were found to be quick in hiking rates when the RBI tweaked the policy tools but were slow in reducing them when the RBI lowered its rates.        
	The panel proposed many components in the base rate: the card interest rate on retail deposits (below Rs 15 lakh) with one year maturity; negative carry in respect of cash reserve ratio (CRR) and statutory liquidity ratio (SLR); overhead cost of banks that could not be allocated; average return on net worth; and yields from current and saving account deposits.        
	Negative carry implies the low return suffered by banks in parking funds as CRR with the RBI and in government securities to fulfil the SLR requirement. Funds in CRR fetch no return, while returns from SLR are small. The overhead costs under consideration are the minimum expenses incurred by a bank. They include aggregate employee compensation, directors and auditors fees and advertising costs. The panel said the base rate criterion was for loans of more than one year. Loans of less than a year can be given without reference to the base rate.         
	Bankers and financial sector experts today welcomed the concept of a base rate as it would usher in greater transparency in lendings.        
	I think it is a move in the right direction. We need some benchmark that calculates the risk element to improve transparency, HDFC chairman Deepak Parekh said.

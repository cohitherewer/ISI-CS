The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Pressure on Pandit 
                                                                                                               Pressure on Pandit 
                                          
	Washington, Feb. 23 (Agencies): Vikram Pandit could well lose his job as the chief executive of Citigroup if the US government comes in with yet another lifeline for the beleaguered financial services company.        
	Citi has received fresh capital of $45 billion from the Federal government. Pandit took over the reins of Citi in December 2007.        
	Top government officials warned Pandit that a third trip to the taxpayer trough would probably cost him his job, The Wall Street Journal reported today.         
	The report noted that in November last year Federal officials privately discussed the possibility of replacing Pandit. But the government decided not to remove him due to a dearth of qualified replacements, it added.

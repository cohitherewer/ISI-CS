The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Wealth tax threshold raised
                                                                                                               Wealth tax threshold raised
          OUR BUREAU                              
	New Delhi, July 6: The threshold for the levy of wealth tax has been raised to Rs 30 lakh. The earlier limit was Rs 15 lakh.        
	The government said it was raising the threshold to allow for inflation adjustment. The limit had been last fixed in 1992. Wealth tax is charged every year in respect of net wealth, on the valuation date, of every individual, Hindu undivided family and company at the rate of 1 per cent of the amount by which the net wealth exceeds Rs 15 lakh.        
	The proposed amendment will kick in on March 31 next year and will apply in relation to assessment year 2010-11 and subsequent years.        
	 Industry has been demanding that wealth tax be scrapped. Finance minister Pranab Mukherjee didnt buy the argument that the tax was not viable since the government had managed to collect just Rs 325 crore  a piffle considering the gross tax revenue of Rs 687,715 crore last year.         
	The wealth tax is projected to grow to Rs 425 crore in 2008-09  an increase of over 30 per cent.        
	LLP structure        
	The government has also tweaked the way limited liability partnerships (LLPs) will be taxed.        
	A detail tucked away in the explanatory memorandum to the Finance Bill 2009 says that limited liability partnerships will be taxed in much the same way that general partnerships. This means that in the case of LLPs, taxation will be in the hands of the entity and exempt in the hands of the partners.

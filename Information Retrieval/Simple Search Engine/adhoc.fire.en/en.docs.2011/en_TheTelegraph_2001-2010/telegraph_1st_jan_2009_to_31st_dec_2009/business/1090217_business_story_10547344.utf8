	New Delhi, Feb. 16: Exporters of some labour-intensive items will enjoy the interest subsidy of 2 per cent till September.        
	Pranab Mukherjee today extended the subsidy on pre- and post-shipment credit to September 30 from March 31.        
	However, exporters were expecting more sops. Reeling under the impact of the global recession, exports have declined for three consecutive months from October to December. In the fist half of the fiscal, exports grew 30 per cent. The government would have to spend Rs 500 crore in 2009-10 on the subsidy.         
	The relief is meant for firms in textiles, carpets, leather, gems and jewellery and marine products.         
	Interest subvention (subsidy) would ease cash flow pressure on exporters and enable them to be more competitive because of the reduction in interest cost, Santosh Dalvi, executive director at PricewaterhouseCoopers, said.        
	It is a welcome step but we were expecting the extension till December and a higher subsidy support which would set us on a par with exporters from other countries who enjoy a lower interest regime, said A. Sakthivel, president of the Federation of Indian Export Organisations.        
	Exporters were also expecting the scrapping of the fringe benefit tax and higher duty drawback rates.         
	Mukherjee, however, gave a fillip to labour-intensive units by proposing the development of giant clusters of small-scale and tiny units in some regions.        
	The government has more than halved the corpus of the technology upgradation fund scheme for textile mills to Rs 1,090 crore from Rs 2,632 crore. The rationale is of many firms availing themselves of funds.

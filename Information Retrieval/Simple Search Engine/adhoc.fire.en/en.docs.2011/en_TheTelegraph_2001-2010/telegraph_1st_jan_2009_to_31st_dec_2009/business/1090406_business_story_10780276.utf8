	New Delhi, April 5: The eighth round of bidding for oil and gas blocks will take off on April 9 amid the global recession and a lack of clarity over tax concessions.        
	I think clarity on the taxation issues will be given by the finance ministry before the bidders file their papers, said a senior petroleum ministry official.        
	In the Union Budget 2008-09, the finance ministry withdrew the grant of a seven-year tax holiday to firms involved in gas production from blocks awarded under the new exploration and licensing policy (Nelp).        
	Officials said, We are discussing with the finance ministry to work out a solution as oil and gas should have a level-playing field.        
	Nelp VIII will be launched on April 9. The bidding will take place in two phases. The first phase will have 70 blocks on offer. In the second phase, which could be held in November, around 80 blocks would be put up for auction.        
	The first phase will include 24 deep-sea blocks, 28 shallow water blocks and 18 onland areas. Of the deep-water blocks, 18 will be in the Andaman amp; Nicobar basin, while the rest are located along the Mumbai, Krishna-Godavari and Kerala-Konkan basins. The 70 blocks will cover an area of 400,000 sq km and are the largest ever offering so far.        
	The first roadshow to promote the bidding will be held in Mumbai on April 20, followed by others in Australia, Singapore, the US and Canada.        
	While officials are optimistic that companies will bid aggressively, industry experts feel mid-level players from other sectors may stay out of the bidding.        
	The impact of the liquidity crunch along with the softening of crude prices will affect the bidding process. However, serious players will still look forward to the bidding, industry analysts said.        
	International crude prices have fallen sharply from a high of $147 a barrel to about $50 at present.         
	The country is launching Nelp VIII at a time when global majors such as Royal Dutch Shell, Exxon Mobil and ConocoPhillips have rationalised their growth plans and trimmed their exploration budget.        
	Under Nelp VII, India awarded 57 blocks to 44 companies, including BHP Billiton and Oil and Natural Gas Corporation Ltd. In the previous six rounds, 162 areas with an investment commitment of $8.33 billion were awarded.

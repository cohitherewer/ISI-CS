          OUR CORRESPONDENT                          Chanda Kochhar in New Delhi on Tuesday. (AFP)                                   
	New Delhi, April 28: ICICI Bank today said it could not be termed a foreign bank and was awaiting further clarification on the circular on new FDI norms.        
	Commenting on the concerns that ICICI Bank and some other domestic banks could be classified as foreign-owned under the governments new FDI guidelines, ICICI Bank joint managing director Chanda Kochhar today said that nothing has changed in the ownership pattern to make it a foreign-owned bank.         
	We continue to have the same ownership for years. Lets see if there are further clarifications that come in the new norms, everyone is waiting for that, Kochhar said.        
	When asked if the bank had got a response to the letter it had written to the department of industrial policy and promotion, she said, we are awaiting a clarification from them. She was speaking on the sidelines of a seminar organised by Ficci.         
	According to the latest filing with the BSE, around 38 per cent of ICICI Bank is owned by overseas investors, including Indians living abroad. However if investments in ADRs, which are bonds issued against equity without voting rights, are taken into account, then foreign investments shoot up to 64 per cent.

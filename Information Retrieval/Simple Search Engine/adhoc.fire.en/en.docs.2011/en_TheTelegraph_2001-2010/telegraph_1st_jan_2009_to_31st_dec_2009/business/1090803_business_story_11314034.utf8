The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Left for gas control
                                                                                                               Left for gas control
          OUR BUREAU                      Bone Of Cotention                          
	Calcutta, Aug. 2: Left MPs today demanded that the government should take over the marketing and distribution of gas produced by Reliance Industries from the Krishna-Godavari (KG) basin so that the national asset was not surreptitiously appropriated as family property.        
	In a letter to Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, the Left members said they were also opposed to linking the price of gas to international rates.        
	As gas is being produced in our own soil, there is no justification in pricing it on the basis of the international price of an altogether different product like crude oil as has been done at present by fixing the gas price at $4.32 per mBtu, the letter said.        
	The members want the empowered group of ministers to revise the gas price and benchmark it to $2.34 per mBtu (million British thermal unit), which is the rate at which Reliance Industries Limited has proposed to supply to NTPC in 2004-05.        
	The Left welcomed the Centres move to file an affidavit in the Supreme Court in the KG gas case and urged the government to follow up such firm assertion by appropriate executive action on proper distribution mechanism to make the gas available to priority sectors.        
	Stressing the need to maintain a regional balance in gas distribution, the letter stated that the government should take over the distribution and marketing rights of the gas at the delivery point so that it could be transported through the national gas grid.        
	According to the Left members, GAIL (India) Ltd, a public-sector unit, can be assigned the nodal agency for the purpose. The signatories to the letter include Sitaram Yechury, Brinda Karat, Basudeb Acharia, Prashant Chatterjee and D. Raja.         
	Commitment call        
	CPI national secretary D. Raja told reporters in New Delhi that the government should stand firm in its commitment made through the affidavit in the apex court that gas was a national asset.        
	We ask the government to remain firm in its commitment in the court. It should not deviate from its stand, Raja said. He said as the custodian of the peoples property, the government should not allow private parties to fight over a national asset.        
	In its recent affidavit in the Supreme Court, the government said a private pact could not be allowed to threaten national interests.         
	It also asked the court to make it a party in the ongoing case between Mukesh Ambanis Reliance Industries Limited and brother Anils Reliance Natural Resources Limited.

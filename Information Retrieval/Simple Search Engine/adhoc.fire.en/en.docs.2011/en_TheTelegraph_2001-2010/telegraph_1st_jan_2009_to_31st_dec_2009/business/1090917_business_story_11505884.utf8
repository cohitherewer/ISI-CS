          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Calcutta, Sept. 16: Hong Kong-based Townland Consultants Private Ltd (TCPL) hopes to finalise the master plan for a proposed airport city project at Andal in the next six months.        
	Bengal Aerotropolis Private Ltd, in which Singapores Changi Airport is a partner, has asked TCPL for a detailed plan of the airport city, which will come up over 2,200 acres.        
	We will create a framework for optimum land use within the city, keeping in mind the various components of the project  airport, industrial cluster and residential block, Richard J. Durack, director of TCPL, said.        
	Durack was in Calcutta today to kickstart the planning exercise. About 600 acres have been earmarked for the airport around which the city will be built.         
	Construction work is expected to start in the next one year.        
	Durack said two-third of the project land has been earmarked for light engineering, logistics and IT.        
	Steven Michiel Beunder, the master planner for TCPL, said the residential block would be low-rise.        
	There will be a central park on 50 acres. There will be a lot of green patches and water bodies, Beunder added.         
	The proposed city will accommodate 150,000.        
	TCE Consulting Engineers will do the infrastructure planning for the project once the master plan is submitted.        
	Townland is working on seven other projects in India, Veronique M. Dryden, town planner of TCPL, said. The projects include a 700-acre township project at Sriperumbudur in Chennai and another 700-acre residential project in Navi Mumbai.

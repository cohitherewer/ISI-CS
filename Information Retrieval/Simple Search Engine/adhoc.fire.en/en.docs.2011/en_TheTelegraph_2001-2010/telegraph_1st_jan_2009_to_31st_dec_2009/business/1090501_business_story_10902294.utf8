	New Delhi, April 30: Bharti Airtel today inked a $500-million, five-year deal with Frances Alcatel-Lucent to build, operate and manage Bhartis fixed line and broadband services.        
	The operations will be managed by a joint venture in which Alcatel-Lucent will hold a 74 per cent stake and Bharti Airtel the remaining 26 per cent.         
	The new entity will also engage over 4,000 Bharti employees who currently handle its landline business.        
	The deal, expected to cover around 2.7 million wireline and broadband customers spread over 95 cities, will see Alcatel-Lucent manage the entire network on Bhartis behalf.         
	Landline business, which combines Internet and IPTV services, is one of the most profitable segments for the countrys largest private telecom company, contributing around 9 per cent to its total earnings.        
	The joint venture will also help us accelerate performances as we migrate to next-generation networks for our broadband and telephone customers, opening the door to advanced services and applications, said Manoj Kohli, CEO and joint managing director of Bharti Airtel.        
	The partnership will drive optimal capital investment and increase operational efficiency by moving voice and data traffic onto a single packetised infrastructure, Kohli said.        
	For Alcatel-Lucent, this will be its second major outsourcing deal in India.         
	Last year, the French-American combine had bagged the deal to manage Reliance Communications CDMA networks across the country. The deal will also help Alcatel-Lucent catch up with its larger competitors in India  Nokia, Siemens and Ericsson.        
	Akhil Gupta, deputy chief executive officer and managing director of Bharti Enterprises, the parent company of Bharti Airtel, had earlier said the benefits of outsourcing network management include better quality and costing, as well as enhanced economies of scale.         
	Bharti Airtel has already outsourced its information technology operations to IBM and its wireless network to Ericsson and Nokia Siemens Networks.

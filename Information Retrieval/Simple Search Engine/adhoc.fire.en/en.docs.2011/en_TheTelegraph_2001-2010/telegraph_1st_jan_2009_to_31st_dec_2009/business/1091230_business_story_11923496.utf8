The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Ground handling status quo
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Ground handling status quo
          JAYANTA ROY CHOWDHURY                          PUT ON HOLD                                  
	New Delhi, Dec. 29: The cabinet committee on security today put on hold a new ground handling policy in airports that was to be brought in from the New Year as it feared job losses.         
	It also decided to tweak the policy, which will now take effect from 2011, by allowing airlines to handle baggage within a terminal building.         
	The Congress-led government had earlier decided to limit the number of ground handling agencies to three per airport. The decision to limit ground handlers, taken at the insistence of the home ministry, was meant to limit the number of people in the tarmac side of an airport, which is the area where planes land and park.         
	Under the new rules, airlines will handle cargo on the terminal side, but on the tarmac there will only be three ground handling agencies.        
	However, airlines under the Federation of Indian Airlines complained that this would lead to job losses.        
	Officials said over 50,000 people employed by foreign and domestic airlines at the Delhi, Mumbai, Calcutta, Chennai, Bangalore and Hyderabad airports risked losing their jobs.        
	Air India unions, representing 20,000 ground handlers, had also threatened to go on strike to oppose the governments decision to set up a ground handling joint venture between Air India and Singapore Airport Terminal Services.        
	The 50-50 joint venture was expected to start from January 1, 2009. However, with todays decision a cloud is hanging over the deal, officials said. Air Indias ground-handling services contribute Rs 800 crore annually.        
	Many companies had shown interest in ground handling, including Jet Airways and Reliance. Of the three agencies, one will be Air India, the other the airport operator, while the third will be chosen via bidding.

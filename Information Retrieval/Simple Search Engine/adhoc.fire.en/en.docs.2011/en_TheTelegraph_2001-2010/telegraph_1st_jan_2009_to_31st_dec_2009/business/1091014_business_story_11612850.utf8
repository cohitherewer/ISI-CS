The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | September car sales zoom
                                                                                                               September car sales zoom
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                                            
	New Delhi, Oct. 13: Domestic car sales are likely to register a double-digit growth this fiscal compared with just 1.31 per cent last year on the back of buoyant sales in the first half of 2009-10, the Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers (Siam) said.         
	The main factors driving growth include the stimulus package and a cut in interest rates. Now we are cautiously optimistic about the future and hopeful of a double-digit growth this fiscal, Dilip Chenoy, director-general of Siam, said.        
	Car sales in September jumped 20.61 per cent to 1,29,683 units  the highest in a month  from 1,07,517 units in the corresponding period a year ago. During the first half of the year, sales grew 14.75 per cent to 6,89,339 units from 6,00,738 units a year ago.         
	Chenoy said the revival in stock markets, a resurgent monsoon and the festival period improved consumer sentiment.        
	Other factors such as launches, festival discounts, a reduction in taxes, improved liquidity and the salary hike of government employees, following the recommendations of the pay commission, also helped.        
	Analysts saw recovery ahead but chose to exercise caution.         
	Issues of concern include fluctuating commodity prices, multiple tax structures, repossession norms, the weak pace of infrastructure growth and the availability of upgraded fuel.        
	We still need stimulants to drive growth in the market, though by-and-large most firms have shown good signs of recovery. If easy access to funds and an improved market condition continue to be a constant phenomenon, double-digit growth is not far away, said auto analyst Murad Ali Baig.        
	However, the buoyancy seen in the car segment during September was missing in two-wheelers, particularly motorcycles.         
	Bike sales rose just 6.56 per cent to 6,73,891 units, while two-wheeler sales grew 7.67 per cent to 8,38,150 units.         
	Commercial vehicles sales increased for the third consecutive month.         
	Sales grew 6.46 per cent to 45,451 units from 42,693 in the year-ago period, Siam said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Flights of fancy too fast to catch
                                                                                                               Flights of fancy too fast to catch
  - Mutuals declare no business day, stop taking trade requests        SRIKUMAR BONDYOPADHYAY                          ON A HIGH: Brokers rejoice outside the Bombay Stock Exchange in Mumbai on Monday. (AFP)                                        
	Calcutta, May 18: The flash of brilliance on the bourses today left investors thirsting for more. Both the sensex and the Nifty jumped more than 17 per cent each, but few investors could buy or sell their holdings.         
	Trading on the bourses halted within a minute of the opening bell and a number of mutual funds declared it a no business day. Investors in equity funds of most fund houses could not purchase fresh units or sell their existing holdings.         
	Fidelity, Tata, Sundaram BNP Paribas, DSP BlackRock, Kotak, HDFC and HSBC announced a no business day and didnt allow any investor to buy or sell units under their equity schemes, said an official with Computer Age Management Services (CAMS) here.                     
	CAMS provides transaction processing and customer care services to 18 mutual fund houses.         
	It was quite logical that fund houses stopped taking any buy or sell requests from investors because they themselves could not buy or sell shares after the trading was suspended for a couple of hours to start with and then for the whole day, said Sanjay Sinha, chief executive officer, DBS Cholamandalam Mutual Fund.         
	In such an event, you simply cannot determine the net asset value of an equity scheme when the prices of the underlying assets are frozen, he added.        
	However, T.K. Maji, regional head of UTI Mutual Fund, said: We have accepted purchase and redemption requests for all our equity schemes except for index plans.        
	On a normal business day, if an investor approaches a fund house to buy or sell units before 3pm, the days NAV will be applicable for that transaction. However, if the request comes after 3pm, the next days NAV will be applicable. Therefore, todays requests will be executed at tomorrows net asset value.         
	Mutual funds that did not accept any redemption or purchase request have also decided not to announce NAVs of their schemes based on todays stock prices.         
	Other fund houses are waiting for the Association of Mutual Funds in India to come out with a clarification on how to calculate the NAV of a scheme in such an event.         
	This is the first time in Indias stock market history that trading on exchanges was suspended because of an unusual rise in share prices. Mutual fund managers, thus, have never dealt with such a situation before.         
	Domestic institutional investors, including mutual funds and life insurance companies, made a net purchase of equities worth Rs 10,317.18 crore since the beginning of this year till last Friday.

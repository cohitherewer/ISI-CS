          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, June 2: General Motors today said it was facing problems in raising funds for its $200-million engine transmission plant at Talegaon, Maharashtra.        
	It hasnt been easy in India to raise the money ($200 million). Frankly, we have had difficulties from Indian financial institutions, but we have not given up, Nick Reilly, GM group vice-president, said.         
	The majority of the fund remains to be raised. It might take us a little longer, but the opening of the plant is largely on schedule. It may be delayed by a month or two, he said.         
	The company said the falling sales of General Motors India  the wholly owned subsidiary of the US firm  were mainly because of customer perception of the months-long uncertainty over GMs future.

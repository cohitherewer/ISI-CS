The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Nokia expands after-sales reach
                                                                                                               Nokia expands after-sales reach
          SOUNAK MITRA                              
	Calcutta, Aug. 2: Nokia is extending its after-sales network to rural India as part of its expansion plans.         
	We felt there was a need for a rural care network to match the rapidly growing distribution footprint. We are also increasing care service centres in semi-urban areas, Sudhir Kohli, Nokia India director (customer care), said.         
	Nokia has started the care-on-wheel service to reach customers in remote villages. The company sends mobile vans, offering services for Nokia phones, regularly.         
	In these areas, it has not been viable for us to open a Nokia Care Centre, though the penetration is speeding up. We need to provide proper services to each of our customers, Kohli said.         
	The company has about 20 such mobile vans across the country.         
	We will be adding more depending on the need, he said.         
	Nokia is also increasing the number of care centres in the semi-urban areas.         
	Nokia has over 200 care centres in the eastern region.         
	The company said it was looking at microfinance as a major initiative to increase mobile penetration. Currently, the penetration is 26 per cent. While India is adding 8 million subscribers a month, the country still has a huge untapped base.

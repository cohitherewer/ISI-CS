	New Delhi, June 22: The government is planning to link royalty rates on minerals to the market price.        
	Royalty system on minerals will be rationalised by adopting an ad valorem principle, wherever feasible, to make assessment and collection simpler and enhance accruals to the state governments, mines minister B.K. Handique said today.

	New Delhi, Aug. 13: The government today agreed to form a group of ministers to look into the woes of the airline industry such as high taxes on jet fuel and steep airport charges.         
	This comes a week after a strike call by the private airlines fizzled out under state pressure. Todays decision was taken after civil aviation minister Praful Patel approached the cabinet with airlines concerns.         
	Airlines face financial trouble because of higher prices of air turbine fuel (ATF), jacked up by the sales tax imposed by states, Patel told reporters after the meeting.        
	He told the cabinet that jet fuel made up 40 per cent of the operating cost of airlines in India, compared with 20-25 per cent, globally. Andhra Pradesh was charging the lowest sales tax of 4 per cent on jet fuel, while it was as high as 28-30 per cent in Karnataka, Gujarat, Kerala, Tamil Nadu and Bengal. The number of flights during the January-July period dropped 12.5 per cent year-on-year, he said.        
	A Rs 1,000 change in ATF price translates into a Rs 300 crore increase or decrease in the cost of operations, he said. Fuel prices have risen 99.6 per cent in the past year.

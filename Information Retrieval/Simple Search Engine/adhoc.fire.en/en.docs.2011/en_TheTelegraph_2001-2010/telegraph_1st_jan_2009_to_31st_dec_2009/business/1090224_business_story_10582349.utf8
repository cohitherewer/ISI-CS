          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Cause for concern                                  
	Mumbai, Feb. 23: ICICI Venture, which has a 23 per cent stake in Subhiksha, is engaged in discussions with various lenders and investors to explore options for revival of the troubled discount retailer.        
	Simultaneously, it has approached the registrar of companies (RoC) to investigate the operational, managerial and financial affairs of Subhiksha Trading Services Ltd (STSL).        
	We are a minority shareholder and do not have management control. But as a responsible investor, we are talking to all the concerned players and are trying to seek a possible solution that will be in the best interests of all, including the employees, said Renuka Ramnath, managing director and CEO of ICICI Venture.        
	Zash Investments, which belongs to Wipro chairman Azim Premji, holds a 10 per cent stake in Subhiksha.        
	The industry is abuzz with rumours that minority investors such as ICICI Venture and Zash may come together to take over the company. Ramnath said the solution would depend on a clear understanding of the problems that beset Subhiksha.        
	ICICI Venture has an exposure of around Rs 106 crore in Subhiksha. It has approached the RoC to order an inquiry and investigate the financial affairs of STSL for the period beginning April 1, 2007 till date. It also wants a reputed firm to be appointed as an independent auditor to look into the accounts of STSL.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | All-clear signal for 3G auction
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      All-clear signal for 3G auction
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                                            
	New Delhi, Dec. 21: The auction of spectrum for third-generation mobile services will be held on schedule with four slots on sale in each of the 22 telecom circles in the country, the empowered group of ministers on 3G policy said today.        
	The nine-member group, headed by finance minister Pranab Mukherjee, has decided that while the auction process will be completed in January, spectrum will be allocated to the successful service providers only in August. Spectrum are radio waves through which mobile phone data travel.        
	To ensure a level-playing field for all successful bidders, 3G spectrum would be allocated simultaneously in August 2010, telecom minister A. Raja told reporters after the meeting.        
	Earlier, the department of telecom had said spectrum would be given in phases with the highest bidder in a circle getting it immediately and the second and third bidders by July and September, respectively.        
	The change in the allocation schedule should allay fears about the highest bidder getting a six-month advantage over others.         
	All spectrum would be allocated at the same time when it is available for commercial use, said Raja. The defence authorities have agreed to vacate around 20 megahertz of 3G spectrum by August to ensure enough availability for four players.        
	The ministerial panel had decided in August this year that five players would be allowed in every circle, with one slot reserved for state-owned BSNL and in Mumbai and Delhi for MTNL.         
	It had set the base price for pan-India 3G spectrum at Rs 3,500 crore.         
	Following the eGoMs decision, the department of telecom will soon issue a notice inviting applications for the sale of spectrum. The DoT has failed to keep its December 8 deadline to issue the notice.        
	The notice is a legally binding document on the auction and will specify all details regarding the sale of spectrum, including its exact availability in each circle and the specific bands for the winners.         
	India expects to auction 3G spectrum from January 14 to enable the countrys almost 500 million mobile subscribers to use advanced telephony services such as video-calling and high-speed Internet access.         
	The government hopes to rake in between Rs 30,000 crore and Rs 35,000 crore from the proposed 3G and WiMax auctions. This revenue will help the government bridge the steep fiscal deficit.         
	Thirteen mobile phone firms are jostling for space in the Indian telecom market, and three more companies are due to launch their services by next year.         
	Number portability, the facility that allows customers to retain their mobile numbers while changing operators, will be implemented from early 2010. This may affect operators who do not win 3G spectrum as they may see their high-end customers migrating to rivals.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Panel to vet foreign investments 
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Panel to vet foreign investments 
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Nov. 24: The government today set up a working group to review investments in the country by foreign institutional investors, NRIs and venture capitalists.        
	The 16-member group, headed by UTI Mutual Fund chairman U.K. Sinha, is expected to review the existing policy on foreign capital and suggest changes to encourage investment.        
	Officials said the group would also study the arrangements regarding participatory notes  instruments through which unregistered foreign entities invest in the domestic stock markets. The committee has to submit a report within four months.        
	The group has been mandated to identify challenges in the way of meeting the financing needs of the economy through foreign investment.         
	It would also examine the rationale of securities transaction tax (STT) and stamp duty, officials said.        
	The government had removed the curbs on participatory notes last year after foreign funds dried up because of recession.         
	However, STT, which is imposed on the sale and purchase of securities, continues to be charged.         
	The panel is in the wake of a recent surge in foreign capital, which has led to the appreciation of the rupee.

	New Delhi, June 8: Passenger cars recorded a sales growth of just 2.48 per cent in May, while two-wheelers grew at an impressive 12.45 per cent.        
	Though rate cuts and the stimulus packages announced by the previous UPA government helped the industry to grow for the fourth successive month, automobile makers demanded fresh support because of the high cost of funds.        
	Borrowing costs still remain high and the effect of the government support measures such as tax cuts are waning, said Sugato Sen, senior director of the Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers (Siam).        
	The fundamentals are not improving and you need more (stimulus), he said.        
	According to Siam data, domestic passenger car sales in May went up to 1,13,490 units from 1,10,745 units in the year-ago period.        
	In the same month, two-wheeler sales surged to 7,27,937 units from 6,47,358 units. Bike sales were up 12.34 per cent at 5,76,541 units against 5,13,209 units in the corresponding month a year ago.        
	Siam is, however, apprehending lower sales in June and its fear is based on the feedback received from vendors and dealers.        
	June will be worse. Fundamentals have not changed  unavailability and the high cost of finance are still affecting, Sen said. Though public sector banks are coming forward, private lenders are not supporting the auto industry to a big extent, he said.        
	Industry analysts, too, believe its going to be a challenging year for the industry. No doubt the industry has recovered but a further push is needed to help the industry get back on its feet faster, said Murad Ali Baig.         
	Vehicle sales in May stood at 9,29,596 units against 8,53,969 units, up 8.86 per cent.        
	In the passenger-car segment, sales of Maruti Suzuki increased 9.71 per cent to 62,878 units from 57,315 units in the same month last year.

Sales of Tata Motors were down at 12,838 units against 14,228 units.

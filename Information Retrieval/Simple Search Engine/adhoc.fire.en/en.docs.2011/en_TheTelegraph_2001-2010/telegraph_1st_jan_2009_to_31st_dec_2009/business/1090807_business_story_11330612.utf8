          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Aug. 6: Finance minister Pranab Mukherjee today promised action to tame the prices of essential commodities, even as the cabinet secretary called a meeting on Saturday to discuss the issue and assess the drought situation in the country.        
	We are sensitive to it (price rise) ... The government is responsible and is responsive. As and when policy measures are needed, it will be taken, Mukherjee said.        
	The finance minister blamed the erratic monsoon for the higher prices of vegetables, fruits and milk. The rainfall was 19 per cent lower than normal on July 29.         
	Agriculture minister Sharad Pawar today said, The overall price situation is very serious but the government has taken various steps (to ease the situation).         
	Mukherjee said the government was taking steps to remove demand and supply imbalances.         
	The government has allowed the duty-free import of refined sugar till November, banned the export of non-basmati rice and cut the duty on edible oil imports to zero. However, it could take more steps to open up imports if it felt the delayed monsoon was unable to deliver.         
	According to sources, cabinet secretary K.M. Chandrasekhar has called a meeting of the state chief secretaries to assess the requirements of states and Union territories that have been hit by insufficient rainfall, or floods, and have seen the prices rising.         
	The government is worried on the monsoon front but if August and September go well we will see a different situation, Pawar said.        
	The worst affected have been Bihar, Punjab, Haryana, western and eastern Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Himachal Pradesh and parts of Andhra Pradesh and Tamil Nadu. Farmers have so far sown paddy crop over 191.30 lakh hectares (lh) in the kharif season against last years 256.76 lh, according to latest agricultural ministry data.        
	However, officials said this would not affect Indias food security as the country had enough rice stocks to last the year. Besides, late rains could see paddy sowing going up in August.        
	Agriculture ministry officials said late sowings were still possible as the situation had improved in the eastern Indian states of Bengal, Bihar and Assam.        
	The country has 329 lakh tonnes of wheat as on July 1 this year against a buffer food security norm of 171 lakh tonnes. Similarly, 196 lakh tonnes of rice are in reserve against the buffer requirement of 98 lakh tonnes.        
	Senior weather scientists said a significant rain deficit was unlikely to be wiped out by the rainfall during the remaining two months of the monsoon season. The meteriological department has predicted a 7 per cent lower-than-normal rain this year.        
	Rabi prospects will depend a lot on how the monsoon fares in the rest of the season.

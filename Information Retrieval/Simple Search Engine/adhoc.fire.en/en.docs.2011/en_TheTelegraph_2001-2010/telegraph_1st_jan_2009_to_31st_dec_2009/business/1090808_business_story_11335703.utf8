	Calcutta, Aug. 7: Berger Paints plans to invest Rs 100 crore to set up a factory in south India.        
	The proposed water-based paints facility will produce one lakh kilolitres per annum and is expected to start operations by the middle of 2011, chairman Kuldip Singh Dhingra said on the sidelines of the companys AGM today.         
	For location, the company is looking at either Tamil Nadu or Karnataka, and a decision is expected soon. Berger requires 30 acres for the unit. The investment will be made over the next two years, Dhingra said.        
	At present, Berger has seven plants with a combined capacity of 2 lakh kilolitres per annum.         
	The company will raise the fund by issuing preferential shares, which it expects to complete by November. It may also look for private equity funds.         
	Dhingra said the company was in a position to acquire mid-sized companies. We are not actively looking for anything, but, we are open to the idea.        
	Berger managing director Subir Bose said the demand for water-based paints was growing 18-20 per cent compared with solvent paints which is growing 8 per cent. So, we have decided to increase our water-based capacities, he said.         
	At present, about 60 per cent of the companys production is water-based.         
	Berger is also in the process of setting up a 24,000-tonne emulsion plant in Gujarat and a 6,000-tonne raisin facility in Goa.                                             
	We have already invested Rs 31 crore in these two plants, Bose said. The Gujarat unit is expected to start operations in April 2010 and the Goa plant will go on stream by December 2009.        
	Earlier, we used to buy emulsion (a raw material for water-based paints). Once this plant is operational, it will help to save the cost of manufacturing by 16 per cent, the MD said. Bose also said with raw material prices coming down, pricing of the paints would be stable during the current financial year.         
	This year, the industry is only going to witness volume growth, he said.                                
	During 2008-09, the paint-maker increased prices twice as crude oil rates touched record highs. The company expects its revenue to grow 12-13 per cent in 2009-10.        
	Berger is also hopeful to register over 30 per cent increase in profit in the current financial year.        
	Last year, our profitability and revenue were impacted because of the adverse global financial situations, Bose said.

                                                                                                                 Q amp;A      Agent query
                                I am a full-time insurance agent. The insurance company debited 10 per cent from my commission as TDS. To get back refund of my TDS, I am supposed to file income tax returns. What is the maximum expense I can claim as deduction without keeping books of accounts? Which income head should I show my earning while filing income tax returns?          Chinmoy Sarkar, Birbhum
                    If your annual income is up to Rs 60,000, you may claim a 33.33 per cent deduction from your income as expenses. You are not required to keep any book of accounts, except Form 16A received from the insurance company. You should file your return in ITR 4 where you can show your income under Income from Business/Profession.                                  No liability      I am 76-years-old and my total annual income is Rs 1.3 lakh. I have an NSS account for the last 15 years with the GPO. If I withdraw the full amount, including an interest of Rs 60,000, will there be any tax deduction at source?         Shyamal Chakrabortty, Calcutta
                    Senior citizens having no taxable income can submit Form 15H with a self declaration and there will be no tax deduction at source on the NSS maturity. Since your total annual income is below the threshold limit of Rs 1.95 lakh, there will no tax liability.                                     Free to sell      I bought some shares 30 years ago. I have no demat account. Can I sell these shares by opening a demat and a trading account? What are the rules? How much tax do I have to pay?        Ritu Pal, Hooghly
                    Yes, you can and you dont have to pay any tax on the capital gain from selling the shares. You can open a demat account with a bank or a brokerage house. The dematerialised shares then can be sold through a brokerage house registered with the BSE or the NSE. You will have to open a trading account with a brokerage house. Since you are holding these stocks for more than a year, there will be no capital gains tax if those shares are sold through a recognised stock exchange.

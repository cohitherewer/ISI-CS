The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Three-year AI blueprint for turnaround
                                                                                                               Three-year AI blueprint for turnaround
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                            
	New Delhi, Aug. 7: Air India today unveiled plans to turn around in 24-36 months by shifting more flights to its low-cost carrier AI Express, spinning off cargo, ground handling and engineering services into separate firms or joint ventures, restructuring debt and taking fresh capital from the government.         
	The airline also intends to come out with a public issue, shed old aircraft and cut incentives paid to employees.         
	Arvind Jadhav, chairman and managing director of Air India, said, We will need capital infusion from the government before that ... we have made a presentation and it will take a call on how much to put into the airline.         
	He refused a guess on how much the government could infuse into the company, but sources said the finance ministry was likely to agree to Rs 1,250 crore.        
	The airlines plan is to increasingly transform into a low-cost carrier. This winter, of the 100 schedules we fly on domestic routes, we will fly the 27 least profitable routes as low-cost carriers by transferring 10 aircraft to AI Express, said Jadhav.         
	In time, 60-70 per cent of Air India schedules will be on the low-cost carrier model.         
	We are a legacy, full service carrier. But now we will look at a low-cost carrier model, he said. This will improve our bottomline. We expect to benefit by Rs 180-200 crore, he said.        
	However, analysts say, with Air Indias high overhead costs, a model that works on low overheads and a great deal of flexibility may not be successful.         
	Jadhav said with the non-core businesses hived off, overheads would come down and the low-cost model could succeed.         
	As part of a broad cost cut, the airline will renegotiate incentives to employees, shut down stations abroad where the airline does not fly.        
	The cost saving measures will be painful, Jadhav said. Weve got into a cash-flow problem. We are unable to service our interest and debt liabilities with our internal resources, he said. The airline has accumulated losses of Rs 7,200 crore and is negotiating with banks to retire high cost debts.                          
	 which make up some Rs 11,000 crore of its Rs 16,000 crore debt portfolio and replace it with cheaper debt. Jadhav said banks had sought a government guarantee for the cheaper loans. The airline requires some Rs 6,000 crore as working capital alone.         
	The restructuring plan comes in the wake of a demand by a high level committee headed by the cabinet secretary that it comes up with a workable plan before the government gives it loan guarantees and infuses fresh capital intoi the carrier. The carrier delayed June salaries to its 32,000 employees and spoke of delaying or canceling aircraft orders after traffic slumped and debt mounted.         
	Air India has inducted some 11 Boeing 777 and 15 boeing 737-800s over the last two years to feed international routes but with a severe global recession taking its toll on travel, many of these planes are flying less than half full. Officials said it is now in talks with vendors  Boeing and Airbus. We are having a re-look at all the new aircraft, Jadhav said. We need to work with the vendors.         
	Sources said aircraft purchase will now be staggerred to 2015-16, instead of being completed by 2011-12. Air India has till date inducted 51 planes out of an order of 111 Boeing and Airbus aircraft order.        
	The airline will have to change the way it does its business and we will do it. Our top priority is execution and accountability, Jadhav said while outlining releasing the revival roadmap of the carrier for the next 36 months.

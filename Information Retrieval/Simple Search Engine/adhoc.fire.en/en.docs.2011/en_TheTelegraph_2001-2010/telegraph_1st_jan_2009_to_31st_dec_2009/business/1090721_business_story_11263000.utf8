The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | HDFC Bank loans set to turn cheaper
                                                                                                               HDFC Bank loans set to turn cheaper
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Trim act                                  
	Mumbai, July 20: HDFC Bank  the countrys second largest private sector bank  has brought down its benchmark prime lending rate (BPLR) by 25 basis points to 15.75 per cent. The revised rate will be effective from today.         
	Only last week, HDFC Bank had reduced interest rates on its deposits of varying maturities.        
	In the past six months, the bank has reduced its benchmark lending rate by 75 basis points. It last slashed its BPLR by 50 basis points to 16 per cent in December.        
	As cost of funds have come down in recent times, a host of banks are lowering their benchmark rates.         
	Last month, ICICI Bank  the largest private sector lender  had reduced the floating reference rate for retail loans by 50 basis points to 12.75 per cent. This benefited all the existing floating rate retail loan customers.        
	ICICI Bank had also reduced its benchmark advance rate (I-BAR) that benefited its corporate borrowers. The revised I-BAR now stands at 15.75 per cent against 16.25 per cent earlier.        
	The State Bank of India had also cut its BPLR by 50 basis points to 11.75 per cent in recent times.        
	Private sector lenders mostly give loans below their prime lending rates. However, some of the corporate loans are linked to the benchmark rate.        
	Thus, to study the relevance of the PLR in the changed scenario, the Reserve Bank last month constituted a six-member working group to review the system and suggest a mechanism for pricing of floating rate loans. This is expected to make the fixation of interest rates by banks more transparent.        
	The group, headed by RBI executive director Deepak Mohanty, is expected to submit its report by August. It will suggest a suitable benchmark for floating rate loans in the retail segment.

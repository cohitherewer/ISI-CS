          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                                  
	Mumbai, April 15: Infosys Technologies today forecast a decline in dollar revenues for this fiscal, attributing it to the global recession, which has forced clients to cut back expenditure and delay finalising deals.        
	Indias No. 2 software firm said it expected dollar revenues to fall 3.1-6.7 per cent, its first ever negative revenue guidance that saw the Infy scrip tumbling nearly 8 per cent in early trading.        
	However, the company reported better-than-expected numbers in the fourth quarter, with net profit rising 29.14 per cent to Rs 1,613 crore against Rs 1,249 crore in the fourth quarter of 2007-08.         
	Analysts had estimated a net profit in the region of Rs 1,570 crore.         
	In spite of a tough environment in terms of pricing and significant volatility in currency, we have managed to do reasonably well, said Kris Gopalakrishnan, chief executive officer and managing director.        
	On a sequential basis, net profit was down 1.71 per cent from Rs 1,641 crore in the quarter ended December 2008.        
	Income for the fourth quarter was Rs 5,635 crore, an annual growth rate of 24.1 per cent though, sequentially, it was down 2.6 per cent from Rs 5,786 crore in the third quarter.        
	Analysts had earlier warned that Infosys was likely to forecast falling revenues for 2009-10 because of the recession, with their estimates varying from 1 per cent to 3 per cent.        
	Infosyss own estimate is much worse  revenues are expected to range between $4.35 billion and $4.52 billion, a year-on-year decline of 3.1-6.7 per cent. However, in rupee terms, revenues are expected to rise marginally by 1.7-5.7 per cent.        
	For the quarter ending June 30, revenues could be in the range of $1.06-1.08 billion, a drop of 6.5-8.2 per cent.        
	Chief operating officer S. D. Shibulal said clients were not only reducing their budgets but also taking a long time in taking IT-related decisions.        
	Chief financial officer V. Balakrishnan said the forecast for the year assumed a 6.5 per cent decline in pricing.         
	He said the pricing for the quarter was down by nearly three per cent, and operating margins could dip 3-30 percentage points by March next year.        
	For the fourth quarter, operating margin came down by over 150 basis points to 33.5 per cent from the preceding period.         
	Infosys said that in the face of uncertainty, it had increased focus on new engagement models such as solution-based offerings.         
	The company added 37 clients during the fourth quarter. It said its cash and cash equivalents stood at over $2 billion at the end of the last fiscal.         
	The cash and cash equivalents, including investments in liquid mutual funds and certificate of deposits, as on March 31, 2009 were Rs 10,993 crore, a company statement said.        
	Besides, the software firm is comfortably placed in terms of current assets for the financial year ended March 31, 2009. The assets, a major source of funds for companies to meet their daily expenses, stood at Rs 12,288 crore.        
	HR head T. V. Mohandas Pai said salaries had been frozen and there would not be any promotions.        
	He said Infosys would hire all the freshers who were offered jobs last year but extend their training period to 7 months from the current 4-5 months.        
	A total of 18,000 were expected to join, including 2,000 laterals (not campus recruits) by the end of the year. They will join production by next year at the same salaries and terms and conditions promised, Pai said.        
	The total headcount of Infosys and its subsidiaries was 1,04,850 as on March 31, 2009.        
	Share shock        
	The weak revenue guidance saw Infosys getting hammered both on the local bourses as well as abroad.         
	The stock had plunged 7.7 per cent at Rs 1,300.05 during the day, before recovering to end with a loss of 2.72 per cent at Rs 1,370.80.         
	On the National Stock Exchange, the share closed at Rs 1,370.60, down 2.75 per cent. Over 63.56 lakh shares changed hands on the bourses.        
	American depositary receipts of Infosys plunged over 9 per cent within minutes of opening of trade on the New York Stock Exchange.

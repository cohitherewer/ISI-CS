The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Identity crisis for ICICI, HDFC
                                                                                                               Identity crisis for ICICI, HDFC
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      Status twist                                  
	Mumbai, Feb. 11: The changes in the foreign direct investment norms announced on Wednesday could have a bizarre fallout.         
	Investments made by two of Indias largest financial entities  ICICI Bank and HDFC  may have to be factored into any calculation of the foreign stake in companies that are subject to sectoral caps on foreign investment.         
	The new norms state that foreign investment through the investing Indian company  owned and controlled by resident Indian citizens  will not be considered for the calculation of the overall foreign stake in operating companies.        
	Experts said ICICI and HDFC would not technically qualify as Indian owned and controlled companies.         
	Although these institutions are run by Indians, they are not owned by them.        
	The total foreign shareholding in HDFC (including 27 per cent of ADRs) and ICICI  taking both the FDI and foreign institutional investment (FII)  exceed 51 per cent.                  Reality riddle      
	Ergo, investments made by the two entities would have to be treated as indirect foreign investment.         
	The inclusion of FII portfolio investments (into the matrix) could lead to a situation where genuine Indian-controlled companies with large FII investments  which coupled with FDI exceed 50 per cent  would be barred from investing in any company in India where FDI is either not permitted or there are sectoral caps, said PricewaterhouseCoopers executive director Vivek Mehra.        
	Ernst amp; Youngs partner Vishal Malhotra said, Under the new norms, if, for instance, ICICI invests 25 per cent in a telecom company, that investment may be treated as FDI.        
	According to data collated from the CMIE, ICICI Bank has investments worth Rs 2,920 crore in the equity of companies that do not belong to the group. HDFCs investments in equity shares other than group companies in March 2008 amounted to Rs 909 crore.        
	HDFC vice-chairman Keki Mistry said, We are invested mainly in HDFC Bank and some listed companies. Mistry discounted the impact of the FDI policy change.

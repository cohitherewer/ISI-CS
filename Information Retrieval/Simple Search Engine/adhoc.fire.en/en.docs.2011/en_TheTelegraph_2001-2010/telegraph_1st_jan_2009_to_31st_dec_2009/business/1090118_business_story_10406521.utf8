          OUR BUREAU                          Ramesh: Helping hand                                  
	Mumbai, Jan. 17: Private power firms may find it easier to source funds, according to the minister of state for power Jairam Ramesh.        
	We are looking at a package, if need be, to liberalise the financing of private sector producers. If we see (projects of high longevity), we will ensure they are implemented, Ramesh said.         
	Discussions have been held with power firms on this.        
	Ramesh said the economic slowdown did not have any adverse effect on power.        
	He said projects of the Eleventh Five Year Plan (2007-12) would not be affected. However, there might be an impact on projects of the next plan.        
	Addition to capacity in the Eleventh Plan is 79,000MW, of which orders have been placed for 72,000MW.

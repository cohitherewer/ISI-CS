The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Sebi sniffs Parekh scent in stocks
                                                                                                               Sebi sniffs Parekh scent in stocks
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Parekh: Back in action?                                  
	Mumbai, June 4: Rogue stockbroker Ketan Parekh, who was barred from trading in stocks for a period of 14 years back in 2003, is up to his old tricks once again.        
	Sebi has garnered evidence that points to Parekhs involvement in some dodgy transactions in collusion with a cabal of market players.         
	The deals relate to five scrips: Cals Refineries Ltd, Confidence Petroleum India Ltd, Bang Overseas Ltd, Shree Precoated Steels Ltd (now known as Ajmera Realty amp; Infra India Ltd), and Temptation Foods Ltd.        
	An interim probe conducted by the market regulator into suspicious dealings in the five securities indicated Ketan Parekhs hand in the manipulative transactions.        
	A routine market surveillance threw up evidence of synchronised deals in these scrips by entities such as Maruti Securities Ltd (MSL), Kundan Leasing and Finance Pvt Ltd, Chandra Financial Services Pvt Ltd, Jay Investrade Pvt Ltd and HSM Financial Services Pvt Ltd. Sebi has now restrained 26 entities, including MSL, from dealing in the market until further orders.        
	Preliminary investigations revealed that Harsh Shirish Maniar and Jay Shirish Maniar were directors of HSM Financial Services, Kundan Leasing and Jay Investrade.        
	Further investigation revealed that Shirish Maniar had been chargesheeted by the Central Bureau of Investigation along with Ketan Parekh and others in the case relating to Madhavpura Mercantile Co-operative Bank (MMCB).        
	Parekh was held on charges of draining Rs 137 crore from the Bank of India through pay orders issued by MMCB in Ahmedabad.        
	Jay Shirish Maniar and Harsh Shirish Maniar are apparently the sons of Shirish Maniar, the report said.        
	Sebi also noticed certain links between MSL and the Maniar group in the form of off-market transactions as well as synchronised deals in the market. It was also noticed that MSL and the Maniar group had executed off-market transactions with third parties in the five scrips.        
	The market regulator said one important detail that linked Ketan Parekh to these deals arose out of an investigation by the income tax department into Parekhs source of funds for the repayment of a loan to MMCB.        
	The department observed that in August 2008, Ketan Parekhs firms had paid a sum of Rs 26.43 crore to MMCB. The money had been transferred through multiple layers. The payment originated from a Ketan Parekh group firm, KNP Securities, and was routed through various entities.        
	Upon perusal of the funds flow chart prepared by the income tax department, it is observed that many of the connected clients named in this order appear as conduits for the funds originating from Ketan Parekh group company, Sebi said.        
	The observations of independent and unrelated investigations by the income tax department tend to support its findings that the connected clients appear to be a group acting together, it added.

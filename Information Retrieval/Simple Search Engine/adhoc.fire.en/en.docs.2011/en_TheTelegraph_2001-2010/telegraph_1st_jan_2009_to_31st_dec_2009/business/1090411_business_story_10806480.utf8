The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | A tinge of bitterness in duty-free sugar import 
                                                                                                               A tinge of bitterness in duty-free sugar import

	New Delhi, April 10: Sugar is turning out to be a headache for the UPA government on the eve of the polls.        
	The cabinet decision to allow duty-free import of sugar appears to have backfired as global prices are firming up.         
	With local rates on the rise, the government had banked on the imported sweetener to reduce prices.        
	Commodity prices had often played a crucial role in the electoral destiny of political parties. Back in 1998, the BJP had lost power in Delhi and Rajasthan on voters wrath over rising onion prices.        
	Indias decision in favour of allowing duty-free imports has seen global prices firming up and landed cost of future deliveries is likely to be Rs 2-4 more (than domestic prices), said Brahm Singh, a leading commodities trader in Delhis market.         
	Indian buying influences the global market, which had warmed up to the possibility of the government easing imports.         
	The government is yet to go public with the decision of scrapping the 60 per cent duty on imported sugar up to 1 million tonnes as it has to be approved by the Election Commission.        
	Sources said two state-run firms were planning to bring 200,000 tonnes from Brazil.         
	They said the government might have to explore subsidies if it wanted to keep prices under check.        
	Domestic wholesale sugar prices rose from Rs 17-18 a kg a year ago to Rs 21 in December and Rs 23-24 now. Prices have been rising on forecasts of lower crop in 2008-09. Analysts expect prices to be Rs 25-26 by June.         
	News of India entering the market saw May sugar futures rising by 36 points to 12.74 cents to a pound. Traders said this meant landed costs would be higher than local prices and this itself could lead to a rise in local sugar prices.         
	Though inflation is hovering over zero, the rising prices of key food products were a cause for worry.

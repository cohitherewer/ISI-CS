The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | RBI seeks ways to reverse growth slide
                                                                                                               RBI seeks ways to reverse growth slide
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      RBI governor D. Subbarao in Mumbai on Monday (PTI)                          
	Mumbai, April 6: The RBI is devising strategies to arrest the moderation in growth and, thereby, restore market confidence, according to governor Duvvuri Subbarao.        
	He, however, opposed the printing of currency to bridge the fiscal deficit.        
	Subbarao was speaking at a seminar organised by the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry.        
	In a crisis of this nature and magnitude, no country is an island. India, too, is hit by the crisis. The main objective (at present) is to arrest the moderation in growth, he said.        
	Though the moderation has been steeper than expected, fundamentals remain strong and India will recover from the global financial crisis faster.         
	Once the world economy regains growth, Indias recovery will be much faster and steeper than the rest of the world, Subbarao said.        
	He warned of global recession further affecting capital inflows and exports, widening the countrys current account deficit. We expect the current account deficit to be higher compared to last year and capital inflows likely to be lower.         
	Subbarao said he was opposed to the industrys proposal to print money and bridge the fiscal deficit. Otherwise, businessmen fear, the government will enter the loan market and take away all the funds.        
	There is no free lunch. I can print a lot of money. I can put up another printing press and print money. They are not benign solutions, he said. Analysts say the printing of money will lead to inflation.        
	Indian banks have stood tall in the face of the global banking crisis. For the RBI, the challenge is to ensure lending rate cuts in response to reductions in its policy rates such as the repo, the reverse repo and the cash reserve ratio, Subbarao said.        
	Some banks, especially the private ones, have not effectively responded to the RBI rate cuts.

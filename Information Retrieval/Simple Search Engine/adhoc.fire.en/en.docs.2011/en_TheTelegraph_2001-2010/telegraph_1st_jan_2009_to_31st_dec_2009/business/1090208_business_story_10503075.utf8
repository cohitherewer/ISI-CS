	Calcutta, Feb. 7: Toyota Kirloskar Motor today said it aimed to sell around 44,000 units of the Innova in 2009 to maintain its market share of 36 per cent in the multi-purpose vehicle (MPV) segment.         
	The company expects to sell about 1,500 Innovas this year in the eastern region compared with 1,400 units in 2008. Its market share in the MPV category fell by a marginal 0.3 per cent in 2008.        
	The company today launched an upgraded version of the Innova in Calcutta.        
	The company also plans to introduce the CNG version of the Innova soon. Its compact car project is on track and will hit the markets by 2010-end.        
	Priced between Rs 7.66 lakh and Rs 11.06 lakh (ex-showroom, Delhi), the new Innova comes in four variants in both petrol and diesel versions.         
	The new Innova has the best fuel mileage in the segment with 13.7 km a litre (under test conditions), said Venkat Krishnan, deputy general manager (south and east) of Toyota Kirloskar Motor.         
	Currently trial runs are on. It will be sold in select cities in the north and the west where CNG is available. It will cost Rs 90,000 more than the regular model, Krishnan said.

                                                                                                               Mukesh confidant under tax watch
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Mumbai, March 5: Sleuths from the income tax department today raided the offices and residence of Anand Jain, the chairman of Jai Corp which is helping Reliance Industries develop its special economic zones in Mumbai and Haryana.        
	The raids began early this morning with almost 100 investigators involved in the day-long operation. Sources said more than 10 locations in Mumbai, including Jains main office in Nariman Point, had been searched.        
	Sources said the authorities were examining certain real estate deals.         
	A statement from the income tax department on the raids is expected on Friday.        
	Jain, who is known to be a close confidant of Mukesh Ambani, is also the chairman of Navi Mumbai SEZ Pvt Ltd, Mumbai SEZ Ltd, Reliance Haryana SEZ Ltd amp; Urban Infrastructure Venture Capital Ltd.         
	The Navi Mumbai SEZ is being promoted by the Reliance group, Jai Corp and Cidco. Jai Corp and the Reliance group are involved in the other ventures.        
	News of the raid sent the Jai Corp stock tumbling on the Bombay Stock Exchange. The stock closed at Rs 74.15, a fall of almost 5 per cent.         
	The Jai Corp stock has suffered in the recent market meltdown. The stock has slumped from a 52-week high of Rs 836.        
	This is not the first time that Jain has come under IT scrutiny. Last year, the department had conducted a survey at the Mumbai office of a real estate fund managed by Jain.         
	Reports then said that the survey was related to a transaction between the fund and a real estate developer based in Chhattisgarh.

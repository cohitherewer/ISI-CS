                                                                                                               Market regains composure
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                             
	Mumbai, July 7: The stock market showed signs of recovery today, after the nearly 870-point thud on Monday, with key indices closing in the green on selective buying.         
	The BSE sensex, after displaying some volatility, finished 127 points higher at 14170.45. Market observers said a rebound was anticipated. Indices had witnessed a sharp fall on Monday as the budget did not meet their expectations.         
	After such a huge fall yesterday, a bounceback was expected, P. Phani Sekhar, fund manager (PMS) at Angel Broking, told The Telegraph.         
	He added that while stocks usually come under pressure on budget day, the following day, investors were more rational in their behaviour.         
	People do go through the fineprint of the budget. Therefore, todays rally should be seen in the context of yesterdays fall and investors being more rational since they have an informed opinion, he said.         
	The sensex today opened at 14103.65 and rose to an intra-day high of 14251.88.         
	However, selling in some of the heavyweights such as Reliance Industries led to the index falling to a days low of 14000.68 before settling at 14170.45, a gain of 127.05 points or 0.90 per cent.

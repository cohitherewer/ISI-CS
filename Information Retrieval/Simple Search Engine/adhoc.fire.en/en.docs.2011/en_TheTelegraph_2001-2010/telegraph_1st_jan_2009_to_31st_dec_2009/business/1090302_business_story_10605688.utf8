        Study the benefits before you get lured by guaranteed returns on insurance plans, says Srikumar Bondyopadhyay                                            
	At a time when investors are no longer willing to risk their money to the uncanny ways of the market, as in the case of unit-linked insurance plans, insurers have reverted to selling conventional plans offering guaranteed returns.        
	Sales of unit-linked plans have declined sharply in the current financial year. Hence, almost all the schemes launched by insurers in the last few months were guaranteed plans only.        
	In vogue        
	Guaranteed return plans have worked wonders for life insurers. Take for example the Life Insurance Corporation of India. The public sector insurer launched Jeevan Aastha, a single premium plan with guaranteed additions, early this year. During the limited offer period of 45 days till January 21, the scheme mopped up more than Rs 10,000 crore in premium.         
	The success of Jeevan Aastha prompted the LIC to launch another close-ended guaranteed plan  Jeevan Varsha  in February. It is a traditional money back policy. The LIC, whose market share had been steadily eroding and was around 50 per cent in November last year, expects to increase its share to 60 per cent after the launch of the two guaranteed return plans.        
	ING Vysya Life, Aviva Life Insurance, Aegon Religare Life Insurance, Reliance Life Insurance, ICICI Prudential Life Insurance and a few others had also launched similar plans offering guaranteed returns last year to attract investors looking for secured investments.         
	Recently, Bajaj Allianz Life Insurance and Tata-AIG Life Insurance Company have come out with their guaranteed plans  Bajaj Allianz Century Plus II and InvestAssure Apex  respectively.         
	The concept of guaranteed returns was in vogue before the life insurance sector was opened up to private players.         
	After private players took the centrestage with their unit-linked plans, they came out with capital protection (return of premium) guarantees. Almost every private player now has a capital protection plan in its stable.         
	However, Birla Sun Life changed the form of guarantee in Ulips with the launch of Platinum Plus in June last year. The scheme promises a guaranteed unit price on maturity. This guaranteed unit price or unit NAV (net asset value) will be the highest NAV recorded on 88 reset dates (the 15th day of each calendar month till June 2015).         
	Now, Tata AIG Life Insurance has launched a unit-linked plan similar to Birla Sun Lifes Platinum Plus. In the case of Tata AIGs InvestAssure Apex plan, there will be 100 reset dates (the 10th day of each calendar month).        
	Is it a good idea?        
	Guaranteed plans may be the flavour of the season, but are these really good for you or are these just baits by insurers to rev up their sagging sales?         
	Guarantees come with a cost, said Sunil Kakkar, chief financial officer of Max New York Life Insurance Company. A policy buyer should clearly understand what the guarantee actually means to him because most of these guaranteed amounts are payable only on maturity of the policy. A policyholder should also understand the costs involved in a guaranteed plan, he said.        
	Life insurance is a long-term investment and over a period of 15-20 years equity-linked investments are self-guaranteed in the sense that the volatility in equity prices is very low  its in single digit, Kakkar said.         
	Most of these guaranteed return policies have a maximum tenure of 10 years. This means if you buy a guaranteed plan now for investment purposes and not for insurance, youll have to buy another policy after 10 years at a much higher premium.         
	For example, a 20-year-old person has to pay an annual premium of Rs 14,738 for a Rs 5-lakh basic endowment policy for 30 years. But the annual premium is Rs 23,978 for a 30-year-old person for a Rs 5-lakh policy for 20 years.         
	Premium prick        
	The premium rate of a guaranteed return plan is also higher than a non-guaranteed plan.         
	Take for example LICs Jeevan Varsha. A 30-year-old person will have to pay an annual premium of Rs 78,497 for a sum assured of Rs 5 lakh for 12 years under this plan. But the premium is only Rs 37,850 under the companys non-guaranteed money back plan, Jeevan Bharti-I.         
	Similarly, the minimum premium for Tata AIG Lifes InvestAssure Apex plan is Rs 90,000, while the minimum premium is only Rs 12,000 for its InvestAssure Care plan and Rs 20,000 in the InvestAssure Insta scheme.        
	Apart from high premium rates, other policy related charges for fund management, policy administration and surrender are also higher for guaranteed plans. For example, the policy administration charge, which is deducted every month by cancelling investment units, in Tata AIGs InvestAssure Apex plan is Rs 93.75 on the first Rs 1,000 sum assured and Re 1 every Rs 1,000 sum assured thereafter.        
	For Tata AIGs InvestAssure Insta plan, the policy administration charges are Rs 75 on the first Rs 1,000 sum assured and Rs 3.25 every Rs 1,000 sum assured thereafter. The fund management charges are also higher in InvestAssure Apex than in InvestAssure Insta.        
	In Birla Sun Lifes Platinum Plus plan, the minimum annual premium is Rs 1,00,000, while it is just Rs 50,000 in its Gold Plus II plan. Policy administration charges are also much higher in Platinum Plus plan than Gold Plus II plan.        
	The word guarantee may sound great, but it comes at a cost. As a policy buyer, you must understand and compare well what is the guarantee you are getting and at what cost. Moreover, these guaranteed return plans mostly invest in debt instruments. Given a 10-year investment horizon, you should determine whether you want to lock in your funds in debt instruments or equities that have historically given much higher return in the long run.

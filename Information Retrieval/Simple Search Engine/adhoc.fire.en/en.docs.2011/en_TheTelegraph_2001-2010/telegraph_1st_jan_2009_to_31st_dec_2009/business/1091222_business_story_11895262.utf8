	Calcutta, Dec. 21: The government expects to have its blueprint on PSU divestment for the next two years ready by March.        
	Currently, consultations are in progress with the administrative ministries of 71 profit-making government undertakings, sixty-one of whom are unlisted, Sunil Mitra, secretary in the central governments department of divestment, said at a meeting with the members of the Indian Chamber of Commerce here today.        
	From January to March, we will discuss with the administrative ministries of these public sector firms and have an action plan ready by the end of March for the selloff process for the next two years, Mitra said.        
	The 71 entities were picked on the basis of the financial results of 2007-08, and the number could well change after an analysis of the latest figures, Mitra said.        
	The government is also mulling the auction route as opposed to the price band method for listing in certain cases.         
	Divestments in four PSUs NTPC Limited, Rural Electrification Corporation Limited, Sutlej Jal Vidyut Nigam Limited and NMDC Limited  were expected to be completed by the end of the current fiscal.        
	The government could earn at least Rs 8,000 crore from sale in NTPC alone, Mitra said.        
	NMDC stake sale        
	ICICI Securities, Citigroup and Morgan Stanley along with 14 other merchant bankers have submitted bids to manage the estimated Rs 14,000-crore divestment of NMDC.        
	The merchant bankers will make presentations on Tuesday and Wednesday before an inter-ministerial group set up under the finance ministry, an official said in New Delhi today.

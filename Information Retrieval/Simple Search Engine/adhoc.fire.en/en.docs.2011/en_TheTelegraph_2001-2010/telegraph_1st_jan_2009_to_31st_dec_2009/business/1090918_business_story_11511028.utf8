The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Reliance sells treasury stock
                                                                                                               Reliance sells treasury stock
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                            
	Mumbai, Sept. 17: Reliance Industries today raised Rs 3,188 crore by selling treasury stock worth 1.5 crore shares at an average price of Rs 2,125 per share.        
	The treasury stock  created as a result of past mergers of subsidiaries with the parent company  was held by Petroleum Trust and nominally recorded as promoters stake.        
	However, under the rules, the stock cannot be voted.        
	Petroleum Trust held a 6.65 per cent stake in the company  or 10.46 crore shares  prior to todays sale.        
	More shares could be sold as it is learnt that the Petroleum Trust is planning to offload around two crore shares.         
	Reliance Industrial Investments and Holdings Ltd, a wholly owned subsidiary of RIL, is the sole beneficiary of the Trust.        
	The Petroleum Trust was formed in May 2002 by Reliance Industrial Investments. It was created after the merger of erstwhile Reliance Petroleum Ltd (RPL) with RIL. Since Reliance Industrial Investments, which held RPL shares could not hold shares of the parent company, the Petroleum Trust was formed to house these shares.         
	Later, a merger of Indian Petrochemicals Corporation (IPCL) with RIL resulted in an increase in the number of treasury shares.        
	The sale of these treasury shares comes at a time when RPL is set to be merged with RIL. The record date for the merger has been fixed as September 29.        
	RIL did not disclose the identity of the buyer or spell out the reasons for encashing the value of the treasury stock.         
	Market circles said local and foreign institutions had bought the shares.        
	Several analysts believed that RIL was likely to use the cash for an acquisition, possibly overseas oil and gas assets.        
	Others, however, felt that the Mukesh Ambani group company could use it to retire debt, particularly of RPL.        
	On the Bombay Stock Exchange, the scrip fell 4.4 per cent, or Rs 97.15, to close at Rs 2,086.35.        
	Deepak Pareek, oil and gas analyst at Angel Broking, gave two reasons for the sharp drop in the RIL stock.         
	The average price of the deal is a discount of 2.5 per cent to yesterdays closing price of RIL. Moreover, it has been felt that this is the peak valuation which promoters are ready to give to the stock, a view that we dont hold, he said.

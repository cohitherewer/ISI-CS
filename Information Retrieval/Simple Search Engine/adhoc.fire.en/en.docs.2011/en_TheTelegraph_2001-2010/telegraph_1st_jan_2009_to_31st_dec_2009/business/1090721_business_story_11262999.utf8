The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Court seeks Ambani view on pact
                                                                                                               Court seeks Ambani view on pact
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, July 20: The Supreme Court today asked Mukesh Ambani-owned Reliance Industries and Anil Ambani-led Reliance Natural Resources to explain why the family pact between the two brothers should not be declared null and void as had been sought by the government.         
	The apex court today clubbed all the pleas in the corporate battle for KG gas and set September 1 as the date for the next hearing.        
	In addition to the cross-petitions filed by the Ambani brothers, a three-judge bench will hear the governments plea to be a party to the case and the claim of the power firms receiving the KG gas to be interveners, Chief Justice K.G. Balakrishnan said today.        
	While the action in the courtroom lasted for a short period today, the stock market tracked every observation of the apex court and made studied moves with every bit of information.         
	On the Bombay Stock Exchange, the Reliance scrip moved up 5 per cent to close at Rs 2,030.65, while the RNRL scrip was down 2.20 per cent to Rs 80.75.        
	The government had filed a special leave petition over the weekend to intervene in the case, arguing that the gas was its property and that the private pact between the Ambanis was not valid.        
	RNRL counsel Mukul Rohtagi opposed the governments plea, saying it was not an aggrieved party.         
	Additional solicitor-general Mohan Parasaran contended that the government was aggrieved by Bombay High Courts interpretation of the family agreement.        
	Harish Salve, who appeared for Reliance Industries, maintained that the court had not stopped the company from selling gas to other parties in accordance with the interim order of the high court.         
	I told the court that the arrangements in place will continueThe court said: We have not stopped you, Salve told reporters.        
	The court said it wanted to hear the case with three judges. So, it set September 1 as the next date. There were no observations, no directions, Ram Jethmalani, who appeared for RNRL, said.        
	RIL and RNRL have been fighting over the terms of a gas-supply agreement struck when the Reliance empire was split in 2005.        
	Bombay High Court ruled last month that Reliance Industries should follow the Ambani family pact and supply 28 million cubic meters of gas per day at $2.34 per million British thermal units (mBtu) for 17 years to RNRL.        
	RNRL wants the gas to be supplied immediately at the earlier stated price, which is 44 per cent less than the government-fixed rate of $4.20 per mBtu. RIL says it cannot supply the fuel without the governments consent.        
	The petroleum ministry, on its part, said it was the owner of the gas and asked the court to declare the Ambani family settlement, that formed the basis for the supply of gas, null and void.        
	Power firms GMR, GVK and Gautami Power, who have been allotted a portion of the gas from the KG Basin, have also moved the court to be made party to the case to safeguard their interests.        
	Observers say it will be interesting to see how the Supreme Court responds to the governments special leave petition  whether it will be made party to the legal battle as a petitioner or as a respondent and not merely an intervener.

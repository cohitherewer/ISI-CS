	Geneva, Feb. 8 (Reuters): Top two Swiss banks  UBS AG and Credit Suisse Group AG  are likely to announce record losses for 2008 this week and UBS will unveil thousands of job cuts, according to Swiss newspapers.        
	Losses at the biggest bank and the worlds largest wealth manager, UBS, will range from 20 billion Swiss francs to 21 billion Swiss francs ($17-18 billion), including, according to NZZ am Sonntag, a 9-billion-franc loss in the fourth quarter.        
	In an unsourced report, the paper also forecast Credit Suisses annual loss will range from 5 billion francs to 8 billion francs, with NZZ forecasting a fourth quarter loss of 6 billion francs.        
	Spokespersons from UBS and Credit Suisse declined to comment. UBS will announce its annual results on February 10 and Credit Suisse on February 11.        
	A Reuters poll forecasts annual losses of 17.2 billion francs and 5.9 billion francs at UBS and Credit Suisse, and fourth-quarter losses of 5.9 billion francs and 3.7 billion francs, respectively.        
	UBS will also announce further cuts of 5,000-8,000 jobs, while Credit Suisse will not make any reductions, Sonntag reported.

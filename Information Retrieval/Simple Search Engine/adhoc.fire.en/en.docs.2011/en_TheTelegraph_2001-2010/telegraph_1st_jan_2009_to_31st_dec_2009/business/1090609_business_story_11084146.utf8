	New Delhi, June 8: The Planning Commission today said the economy in the current fiscal should at least maintain the growth rate of 6.7 per cent reported last year.        
	It also favoured the government divesting up to a 49 per cent stake in state-owned firms to raise resources.        
	Planning Commission deputy chairman Montek Singh Ahluwalia said, We should at least be aiming at the same growth as achieved last year and I think we could do a little better.        
	There is scope to raise significant resources by selling government stakes in the state-run firms. To my mind commitment to retain public sector units within the public sector only requires that 51 per cent of the equity be held by the government. So there can really be no objection to divesting up to 51 per cent, he said.        
	The commission has started discussions with the finance ministry on the appropriate size of the expenditure plan for the current financial year, he said.         
	Ahluwalia said there was a need to limit subsidy costs.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Rising food, oil prices worry RBI chief
                                                                                                               Rising food, oil prices worry RBI chief
                          D. Subbarao, RBI governor                    
	Pune, June 20 (PTI): Reserve Bank governor D. Subbarao today expressed concern about rising food and oil prices.         
	There are definite trends coming through, although the headline price index is negative. Oil prices are firming up and commodity prices are increasing around the world. Food production is below the trend level, Subbarao said.        
	Prices of food and primary articles in the country are still high, he said. In a country like India, it is important to ensure food prices are reasonable, the RBI chief said.         
	The central bank will consider all price trends in its July review, when it will also revisit growth and inflation targets, he said.        
	For the week ended June 6, inflation slipped into the negative zone (-1.61 per cent) though food articles turned costlier by 8.7 per cent, pulses moved up 17 per cent, cereals rose 13.5 per cent and fruit and vegetables inched up 10 per cent.        
	Although the wholesale price index is negative, there are certain parts of the index, like food articles, where inflation is significant, Subbarao said.         
	However, there was no threat of deflation, he added.        
	The decline in inflation was on account of a fall in fuel prices as international crude oil is now ruling around $70 a barrel against over $140 a barrel during the year-ago period.        
	India does not suffer from any demand constraints. Therefore, there is no concern of deflation, Subbarao told reporters here.        
	According to the RBIs annual monetary policy, inflation is projected at 4 per cent at the end of March 2010.        
	On growth, Subbarao said there was need to get back to the high growth trajectory.        
	I think the stimulus measures of both of the government and the RBI have worked their way through, he said.        
	Demand is picking up in cement, steel, coal and auto sector, he said.        
	According to Subbarao, the Reserve Bank will be looking at reversing the expansionary policy at an appropriate time. I do not want to say we are going to do it right now or in the near future but certainly that is part of the agenda, he said.

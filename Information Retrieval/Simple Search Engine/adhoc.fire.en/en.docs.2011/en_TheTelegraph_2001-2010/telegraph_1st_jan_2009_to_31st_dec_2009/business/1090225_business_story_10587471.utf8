   Industry cheers stimulus package          OUR CORRESPONDENT                                                  
	New Delhi, Feb. 24: Corporate India today welcomed the stimulus measures announced by stand-in finance minister Pranab Mukherjee, saying it would help industry to tackle the economic crisis.        
	A further reduction in excise and service tax by 2 per cent and the extension of the earlier 4 per cent cut in excise duty beyond March 31, 2009 will go a long way in stimulating consumption demand, said Chandrajit Banerjee, director-general, the Confederation of Indian industry (CII).         
	The measures will help industry go through the rough patch. They will benefit the economy and keep it moving forward at a time when the external markets are in a bad shape, said Ficci president Harsh Pati Singhania.         
	Reduction in service tax rates would add to export competitiveness by about 0.25 per cent as refund of the tax is a herculean task, Fieo president A. Sakthivel said.        
	The fiscal measures should be coupled with further monetary measures as inflation has now come down to below 4 per cent. Repo and reverse repo rates could be reduced by 50 basis points together with a similar reduction in the cash reserve ratio, said CIIs Banerjee.        
	Assocham also demanded a cut in the cash reserve ratio. Industry is hopeful that the RBI on its own will come forward to meet the minimum expectations of India Inc, said Sajjan Jindal, president of Assocham.        
	Industry also wants the government to dole out more relief measures to steel and other allied sectors.        
	Industry had expected some sort of relaxation for steel and other allied sectors, said Jindal.        
	The initiatives will help build confidence among the masses because it gives a clear message that the government is sensitive to difficulties faced by trade and industry, said Satish Bagrodia, president of the PHD Chamber of Commerce and Industry.

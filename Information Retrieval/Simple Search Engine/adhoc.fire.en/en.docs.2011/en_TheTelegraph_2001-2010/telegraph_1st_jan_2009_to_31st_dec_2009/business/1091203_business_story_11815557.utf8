          OUR BUREAU                              
	Dec. 2: Telecom operators claim to have pulled the plug on over 2.5 crore Chinese-make handsets that didnt carry distinctive identification numbers but already there are reports that customers have found both legitimate and shady ways to stay connected.        
	The mobile service providers were ordered to deactivate from December 1 all phones that didnt have genuine international mobile equipment identity (IMEI) numbers.        
	The IMEI is a 15-digit code that identifies a mobile phone. This number shows up on the operators network whenever a call is made or received from the handset. This is one of the ways that security agencies try to keep tabs on criminals and terrorists.        
	The legitimate way to keep one of these phones operational is to pop down to any of the 1,600 centres that have been authorised to issue IMEI numbers in the country. The cost? Just Rs 199.        
	These centres will mechanically implant an IMEI number on the affected phone. Amid reports that several customers had reactivated their phones through these centres, it was learnt that the Mobile Standards Alliance of India had officially closed this programme.        
	MobileStore  one of the authorised entities to legitimise the dead Chinese handsets  said in a press release today that the company had successfully implanted 30,000 IMEI numbers at its 160 stores in 60 cities.        
	However, there were reports that a number of shady operators had started embedding clones of genuine IMEI numbers on these phones, creating an illusion of authenticity and perpetuating a major security risk.        
	Some handsets have cloned the IMEI numbers which is reflected as genuine numbers at the service providers end and this can pose security risks, said Pankaj Mahendroo, national president of the Indian Cellular Association.        
	Industry mavens said it was difficult to distinguish between the genuine and fake phones though the mobile companies said they were doing everything possible to disconnect the illegal phones.        
	The Global Systems for Mobile Communications Association (GSMA) is the only body that supplies IMEI numbers to mobile handset makers worldwide through its reporting bodies. It also maintains a database of genuine IMEI numbers. This is activated and updated every 15 days.        
	On Monday, the industry body representing GSM players  the Cellular Operators Association of India (COAI)  had approached the department of telecommunications as well as the home ministry seeking an extension of the deadline for deactivation. They argued that most customers who use these cheap Chinese handsets without IMEI numbers would not be able to afford a new handset.         
	The COAI had wanted additional time so that such customers could get a software patch that would implant an IMEI number on the phones.

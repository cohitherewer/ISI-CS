The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Price pressure on gold demand
                                                                                                               Price pressure on gold demand

	October 14: Soaring prices are likely to dent the demand for gold tomorrow, which is Dhanteras.        
	Merchants are expecting demand to fall by as much as 50 per cent, with buyers opting for smaller items.        
	The yellow metal rose to a record high of above $1,070 an ounce on Wednesday in London as the dollar slid to 14-month lows against the euro and oil prices inched towards $75 a barrel, boosting interest in commodities.        
	In India, where markets are influenced by global trends, prices are sizzling at record levels. In Calcutta, pure gold is at Rs 16,265 per 10 gm after scaling Rs 16,385 yesterday.        
	Dhanteras, when precious metals are bought in the belief it would lead to prosperity, generally accounts for sales of 15-20 tonnes of gold. But when consumers throng to jewellery shops and banks on Thursday, they are expected to look for smaller items.        
	This year, our new initiative has been the 2 gram coin, said an executive in a private bank in Mumbai. Smaller coins are definitely going to sell more, the executive added.        
	Traders and dealers said high prices, inflation and the economic slowdown are turning people into cautious buyers. We see gold demand to drop by 50 per cent tomorrow because prices are ruling at an unaffordable level now, Bombay Bullion Association president Suresh Hundia said.        
	Dhanteras is also expected to show Indians growing love for gold as an investment in the form of coins and bars rather than jewellery.        
	Jewellers and traders said the shift towards buying bullion over the past 4-5 years was here to stay as more consumers realise it is the more economical way to buy gold.        
	Now even small investors have started buying gold coins. They collect it for their children, said Harmesh Arora, director of NIBR Bullion Pvt Ltd, a Mumbai-based gold refinery that sells coins.

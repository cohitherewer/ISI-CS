	New Delhi, Aug. 18: The finance ministry plans to restructure the loans of farmers in drought-hit districts.         
	For small farmers, the ministry is weighing a moratorium on interest for a year.        
	In addition, it is considering an extension of the payment period of all farm loans in the drought regions.        
	These options are now being discussed with the Reserve Bank of India and the nationalised banks, top officials said.         
	Discussions on such a package for more than 177 districts began after the government decided against giving another round of farm loan waivers.         
	Finance minister Pranab Mukherjee today admitted as much when he told newspersons that there is no such proposal (farm loan write off).         
	Last year, the Congress-led government had announced a Rs 71,000-crore waiver, which was believed to be a vote catcher, though heavily criticised by economists and political opponents.        
	Officials in the finance ministry said the restructuring plan was not unusual. Debt restructuring and moratoriums on interest payments have been done for farmers earlier and certainly many times for industry. The biggest such restructuring was done for steel makers when there was a slump in prices in the late 1990s, they said.         
	Banks are also being instructed to grant farm loans on easier terms and with less hassles in all the drought-hit districts. The idea is to make credit available to them in case they go in for late sowings as also to tide themselves over the current crisis, the officials said.        
	The government has already promised a minimum loan relief of Rs 20,000 to farmers residing in desert and drought-prone areas, which are spread over 237 districts across 18 states of the country.        
	The officials said a number of proposals on farm credit had also been received from the state agriculture ministers conference, which were being considered.         
	Prime Minister Manmohan Singh said earlier today that the country was facing a drought threat. We are staring at the prospect of an impending drought, he told a meeting of state environment ministers.        
	Financial major Citigroup today slashed its outlook for Indias gross domestic product growth to 5.8 per cent from its earlier projection of 6.8 per cent on anxiety about the drought situation, while Reserve Banks deputy governor K.C. Chakraborty today said that prices this year were likely to go up because of the erratic monsoon.        
	Planning Commission deputy chairman Montek Singh Ahluwalia said the poor monsoon would adversely impact farm production and eat into economic growth. The existence of drought by itself can lead to some shaving down of the growth projections, he said.        
	Last week, the met department said rainfall between June and September would be 87 per cent of the average against an earlier projection of 93 per cent.         
	Agronomists expect this years rice crop to be 12 million tonnes less than the 99.4 million tonnes produced last year.        
	As part of an attempt to ease credit flows, the finance ministry officials said, the government will pump more money into rural banks through their sponsor banks.         
	Regional rural banks (RRBs) disbursed Rs 41,220 crore during 2008-09, and will be asked to step up credit during the current year.         
	The finance ministry officials said that RRBs were recapitalised in 2007 and could be used as rural arms of the nationalised banks for farm credit schemes.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | GM charts plan to clear debt
                                                                                                               GM charts plan to clear debt
                            
	Detroit, May 6 (Reuters): General Motors Corp on Tuesday detailed plans to all but wipe out the holdings of remaining shareholders by issuing up to 60 billion new shares in a bid to pay off debt to the US government, bondholders and the United Auto Workers union.        
	The unusual plan, which was detailed in a filing with US securities regulators, would only need the approval of the US treasury to proceed since the government would be the majority shareholder of a new GM, the company said.        
	The flood of new stock issuance that could be unleashed has been widely expected by analysts who have long warned that GMs shares could be worthless whether the company restructures out of court or in bankruptcy.        
	The debt-for-equity exchanges detailed in the filing with the US Securities and Exchange Commission will leave GMs stock investors with just 1 per cent of the equity in a restructured auto maker, ending a long run when the Dow component was seen as a bellwether for the strength of the broader US economy.

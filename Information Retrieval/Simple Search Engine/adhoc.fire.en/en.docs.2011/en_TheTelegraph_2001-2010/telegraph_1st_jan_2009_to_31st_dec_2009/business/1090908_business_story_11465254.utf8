The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Cadbury spikes Kraft bid
                                                                                                               Cadbury spikes Kraft bid
                                          
	London, Sept. 7 (Reuters): Britains Cadbury, the worlds second biggest confectionery group, has rejected a $16.7-billion bid approach by Kraft Foods Inc but North Americas biggest food group still hopes to clinch a deal.        
	Kraft said it had offered 300 pence in cash and 0.2589 new Kraft shares for each Cadbury share in the hope that it could create a global powerhouse in snacks, confectionery and quick meals with combined revenues of about $50 billion.        
	Cadbury shares jumped 36 per cent to 778 pence at the open on Monday, helping lift the European food and consumer goods sector, with Anglo-Dutch giant Unilever up 2.6 per cent and Nestle, the worlds biggest food group, up 0.7 per cent. Cadburys shares had lost about 17 per cent over the year through its close on Friday.         
	Based on Krafts own closing share price of $28.10 on September 4 and a sterling exchange rate of $1.6346, the offer values each Cadbury share at 745 pence and the company as a whole at 10.2 billion ($16.66 billion).        
	The offer is a 31 per cent premium to Cadburys closing share price of 568 pence on September 4, Kraft said.        
	Cadburys board had rejected the proposal.         
	The board is confident in Cadburys standalone strategy and growth prospects as a result of its strong brands, unique category and geographic scope, the British company said in a statement. The board believes that the proposal fundamentally undervalues the group and its prospects.         
	Kraft said in a statement, that it was committed to working toward a recommended transaction and to maintaining a constructive dialogue. The US company said it had published details of its approach in order to encourage and further that process.        
	Kraft predicted a takeover would result in meaningful revenue synergies over time and said there was an opportunity to save at least $625 million a year in pre-tax costs.        
	Cadbury, whose brands include Bassetts Liquorice Allsorts and Maynards Wine Gums as well as its trademark chocolate bars, had sales of 5.4 billion ($8.8 billion) last year, while revenues at Kraft, which makes Maxwell House, Oreo cookies and Ritz crackers, were $42 billion.        
	Kraft said it expected any tieup to boost earnings in the second year following completion and that the company would likely lift its long-term revenue growth target to over 5 per cent from over 4 per cent at present as a result of any deal.        
	The company would also expect to lift its earnings per share growth goal to 9 to 11 per cent from 7 to 9 per cent at present.        
	Northfield, Illinois headquartered Kraft said that in the event of any deal it would offer Cadbury shareholders a mix and match facility under which they could elect, subject to availability, to vary the proportions in which they would receive cash and new Kraft Foods shares.

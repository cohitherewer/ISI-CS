          A STAFF REPORTER                          R.K. Krishna Kumar in Calcutta on Tuesday. A Telegraph picture                                  
	Calcutta, Sept. 1: Tata Tea will be renamed as part of its plan to establish itself as a complete beverage company, Tata Sons chairman Ratan Tata said today.        
	Tata Tea has become a beverage company, its not just a tea company, he said at the firms annual general meeting here today. The change of name is being considered to reflect the diversified portfolio that includes bottled water, health drinks, coffee and ready-to-drink beverages.        
	We have shortlisted a few names and expect the exercise to be complete in two weeks, vice-chairman R.K. Krishna Kumar said.         
	Tata Tea is mulling a financial integration of its global operations, Krishna Kumar said. Currently, we are examining the tax implications. Our intention is to have one cohesive company, he said.         
	After the change in name, the company may also shift the headquarters of its global operations from London. However, the company will continue to have its registered office in Calcutta.         
	Tata Tea is the umbrella organisation for several non-tea businesses such as health drinks, mineral water and coffee. The new entity will be a holding company.        
	The company plans to launch its Tata Tea and Himalayan brands globally. We have identified four global brands. These include Tetley, Good Earth, Tata Tea and Himalayan, P.D. Unsworth, head of global operations, said.        
	At present, tea contributes 78 per cent to the companys revenues. The rest comes from coffee and other products.        
	In a few years, we see our non-tea business contributing 50 per cent revenue to the total beverage kitty, Tata said.        
	Krishna Kumar said the company had a war chest of Rs 1,700 crore, which it intended to use for acquisitions.

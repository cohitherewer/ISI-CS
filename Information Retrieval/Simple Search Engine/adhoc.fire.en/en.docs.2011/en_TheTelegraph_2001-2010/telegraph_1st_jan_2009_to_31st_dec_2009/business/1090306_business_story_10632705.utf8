	 New Delhi, March 5: The empowered group of ministers today gave an in-principle approval to lift the ban on export of wheat and wheat products after the elections, but refrained from doing away with the curb on export of non-basmati rice. The government had banned export of wheat in February 2007 and that of non-basmati rice in April last year to boost domestic supply and contain price rise.                            
	 New Delhi, March 5: Inflation declined to 3.03 per cent by the third week of February on the back of cheaper food, fuel and manufactured items. With the wholesale price-based inflation falling 0.33 percentage points from 3.36 per cent a week ago, economists expect the RBI to further cut rates next month.                            
	 New Delhi, March 5: State-owned telecom service provider Bharat Sanchar Nigam has slashed its local and STD rates by 50 per cent, allowing rural users to make calls at 40 paise per minute.                            
	 Detroit, March 5: General Motors said its auditors had raised substantial doubt about its ability to survive outside bankruptcy if it failed to stem its losses and stop burning cash.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Satyam reveals bid rules 
                                                                                                               Satyam reveals bid rules 
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                            
	Mumbai, March 24: Satyam Computer Services today set the ground rules for the bidding process to pick the new promoter of the fraud-scarred software giant.        
	The company said there would be a second round of financial bids if there were bids that amounted to at least 90 per cent of the highest bid.        
	While Satyam hopes to finalise the successful bidder by April 30, it has set several conditions for the bidders who are vying to pick up a controlling 51 per cent stake in the company.        
	Satyam has shortlisted six candidates and is likely to announce the list on Wednesday.        
	The bidding will be a three-stage process: in the first phase, the bidders will bid for a 31 per cent preferential stake in the company. This will be followed by an open offer to the public to acquire another 20 per cent.        
	If these two stages fail to raise 51 per cent, the bidder will have the right to opt for a second preferential allotment to cover the shortfall. The option will have to be exercised within seven days of the close of the open offer. The second preferential allotment must be completed within 15 days of the close of the open offer.        
	The successful bidder cannot sell the shares obtained from the preferential offer and the subsequent open offer for a period of three years.        
	The chosen promoter will also be barred from selling any assets or undertaking of Satyam for a period of two years from the date of completion of the open offer process.        
	In what could be a disappointment for those seeking greater clarity on Satyams legal liabilities in the US, the Hyderabad-based company said it would not be in a position to provide an estimate of the potential claim values.        
	Neither the company nor its counsel will be in a position to provide an estimate of the potential claim values or settlement values in such class action suits. The bidder may undertake its own independent assessment based on publicly available information, the company said.        
	Satyam also stipulated that the pre-preferential allotment holding of the successful bidder would be locked in for a period of six months. The chosen one will also be responsible for the payment of fees to the two investment bankers Goldman Sachs and Avendus Capital.        
	According to Satyam, the successful bidder will be selected based on their financial bid and other technical criteria such as corporate governance and clean track record.         
	Meanwhile, the CBI today sought court permission for a lie detector test on Satyam founder B. Ramalinga Raju.

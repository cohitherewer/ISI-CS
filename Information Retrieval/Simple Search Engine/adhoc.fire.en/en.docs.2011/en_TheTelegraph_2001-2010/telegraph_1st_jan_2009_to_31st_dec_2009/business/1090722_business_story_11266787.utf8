                                                                                                               July price hike fails to cheer up oil firms
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, July 21: State- run oil companies will suffer a loss of Rs 2,880 crore in July even after a price hike this month, petroleum minister Murli Deora said.         
	The government had increased the prices of petrol by Rs 4 a litre and diesel by Rs 2 a litre on July 1.        
	However, the hike has helped oil firms to cut their revenue loss for July from Rs 4,870 crore to around Rs 2,880 crore.        
	Even after the price increase, the companies are still suffering under-recoveries on petrol and diesel of Rs 1.01 per litre and Rs 0.02 per litre, respectively, he said.        
	Over the last six months, international oil prices have been on the rise. The Indian basket of crude oil, which averaged $40.61 per barrel in December, rose to $69.12 per barrel in June, he said.        
	Oil prices fell slightly during the first fortnight of July. However, they have again started rising in the second fortnight, and the average price of the Indian basket during July is $63.22/barrel.        
	The minister said, The government is monitoring prices closely and will take appropriate pricing decisions to protect the interest of the common man.        
	Deora said states were levying high rates of tax on petrol and diesel. The ministry has requested all chief ministers and the finance minister of Bengal, as the chairman of the empowered committee of state finance ministers, to rationalise sales tax on petrol and diesel.

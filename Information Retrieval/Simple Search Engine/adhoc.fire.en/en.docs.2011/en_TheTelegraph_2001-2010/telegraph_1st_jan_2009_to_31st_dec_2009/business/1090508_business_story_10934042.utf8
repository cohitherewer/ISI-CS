The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Jet offers no-frills service
                                                                                                               Jet offers no-frills service
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Spoilt for choice                                  
	Mumbai, May 7: In an effort to shore up revenues amid a slowdown, Jet Airways is launching an all-economy, no-frills services on some routes from Friday.        
	This service will offer fares that will be 15 per cent cheaper than the full fare Jet Airways service and comparable with the airlines low-cost arm JetLite, Jet Airways senior vice-president (alliances and partnerships), Gaurang Shetty, told The Telegraph.        
	The countrys second biggest airline will market this service as Jet Airways Konnect. It will cover 19 routes. Initially, the airline will operate with two 737 and 6 ATR aircraft on routes, including Mumbai-Ahmedabad, Mumbai-Bhopal, Mumbai-Udaipur, Chennai-Coimbatore, Chennai-Madurai, Bangalore-Pune and Bangalore-Mangalore.        
	Jet expects the airline to raise the load factor on these routes by as much as 30 per cent.        
	Explaining the rationale for not including these routes under JetLite, Shetty said, There are logistical as well as operational issues which prevented us from doing so. And the process will be time consuming. Besides, our customers are looking for an option as of now and this prompted us to offer the all-economy, no-frills service under the Jet brand.         
	According to him, the airline also see no reason to dismantle the JetLite model to accommodate the new routes especially as the budget carrier is flying at a 70 per cent load factor compared with 50 per cent on some routes in the full-fare service.        
	JetLite will continue to operate separately. There will be hardly any overlap between the services of Jet and JetLite. Instead, they will be complementary, Shetty said.         
	Dismissing the possibility that Jet launched these no-frills services as it was engaged in a legal battle with the Sahara group over the non-payment of dues arising from the acquisition of the erstwhile Sahara Airlines, Shetty said, This is pure conjecture and there is no truth in it.

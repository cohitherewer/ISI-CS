The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Gold price scales new peak
                                                                                                               Gold price scales new peak

	Sept. 8: Gold prices touched all-time highs in the bullion markets today on heavy buying by stockists who are taking cues from the global markets where the yellow metal crossed the psychological $1,000 an ounce level.        
	Analysts said the buying activity was strong enough to overcome the onset of Shard, an inauspicious fortnight in Hindu mythology for making fresh purchases. The (price) trend is quite bullish. There are people waiting to buy at this level, said T. Gnanasekar, director at Commtrendz Research.        
	In Calcutta, the price of pure gold (24-carat) surged Rs 150 to close at an all-time high of Rs 16,140 per 10 gm today against Rs 15,990 yesterday. Similar peaks were reached in Delhi and Mumbai.        
	In Mumbai, the countrys biggest bullion market, pure gold hardened by Rs 135 to touch Rs 15,950 per 10 gm against Rs 15,815 previously. Standard gold in Delhi was at its highest at Rs 16,200 per 10 gm, an increase of Rs 200 from yesterdays Rs 16,000.         
	Demand at the retail level for marriage and the festival season is expected to pick up once the Shard period ends. India accounted for more than 20 per cent of the global demand for gold jewellery in 2008.        
	Prices in London crossed the $1000-per-ounce mark over concerns about the dollars weakness and fears of inflation, which raised the appeal of the yellow metal. Spot gold rose as high as $1,007.45 an ounce, the highest since March 2008, when it touched $1,030.80 an ounce.        
	Share prices, too, are moving in tandem with gold. Stock market barometer sensex, which touched a 15-month high yesterday, advanced further today, mirroring global markets, though the gains were limited to 107 points on profit-taking by investors.         
	Blue-chips Reliance Industries, the SBI and Tata Steel were the pacesetters. The sensex settled the day at 16123.67, netting a rise of 107.35 points, or 0.67 per cent, over the previous close.        
	Asian indices ended up about 0.60 per cent to 2.1 per cent, while the European markets traded in the green during the day.        
	The rupee gained 18 paise against the dollar to close at a four-week high of 48.48 as firming equity markets and weak dollar overseas powered the domestic currency to extend its rising streak for the fifth straight session.

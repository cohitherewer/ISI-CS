The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Bid to hike public stake in listed firms
                                                                                                               Bid to hike public stake in listed firms
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Oct. 2: The finance ministry is working on guidelines that will enable listed companies to increase their public holding where promoters own more than a 75 per cent stake.         
	The process (to draft rules) has started. The framework will be ready by this year-end, said officials. The draft will be released for public comments and the framework is expected to be out by December.         
	In February, the finance ministry had proposed to make it mandatory for companies listed on the stock exchanges to maintain a minimum public holding of 25 per cent.        
	Officials said the Securities Contracts (Regulation) Rules, 1957, needed to be amended for the purpose. For a company to be listed and continue to be listed, it must have a public stake of 25 per cent, the finance ministry had said while releasing a discussion paper on public holdings for listing.        
	The larger the number of shares and the number of shareholders, that is, larger the public float, the less is the scope for price manipulation, the paper said.         
	Many companies are diluting around 10 per cent of their stakes through public offers at a high premium. In many big companies, public holding is between 5 per cent and 15 per cent. Around 10 per cent of more than 2,000 actively traded stocks on the BSE and the NSE have a non-promoter holding of less than 25 per cent.         
	Public shareholding norms differ across various countries. In Singapore, a company must have public holding of 12-25 per cent for an IPO, depending on the market capitalisation. On the Nasdaq, a listed firm must have one million publicly held shares. In London, 25 per cent public holding is essential for a listed company.         
	Once the framework is ready, a slew of follow-on offers is expected to hit the market as around 180 companies have less than 25 per cent public holding.         
	Leading PSUs where government holding is above 75 per cent include MMTC, NMDC, Hindustan Copper, PowerGrid, NTPC, SAIL, Shipping Corporation and Neyveli Lignite.         
	Private companies such as Wipro, DLF, Reliance Power, Mundra Port, TCS and IL amp;FS also have less than 25 per cent stake with the public.

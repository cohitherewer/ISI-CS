	New Delhi, April 12 (PTI): Foreign institutional investors, who had turned away from the Indian equity market last year, seem to be returning back. Since the beginning of 2009-10, they have put in over Rs 1,000 crore into the domestic market.        
	The FIIs have made net investments of Rs 1,056.1 crore since April 1, according to latest data available with the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi).        
	In the last fiscal, the FIIs had pulled out around Rs 50,000 crore from the bourses, almost equalling the inflow in the previous fiscal.        
	According to the Sebi data, the net FII outflow in 2008-09 was Rs 47,706.2 crore till March 30 compared with inflows of Rs 53,000 crore a year ago.        
	In the past two weeks, the sensex has gained over 900 points, or over 9 per cent, though there have been just five trading sessions because of the holidays in between.              
	On Thursday, the last trading day of the week, sensex closed at 10,803.86 points.

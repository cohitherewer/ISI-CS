          OUR BUREAU                          Thorat: Cash course                                  
	Mumbai, Feb. 3: The Reserve Bank today asked public sector banks to enhance credit flow to the fund-starved micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs) and restructure their accounts in a time-bound manner.        
	At a MSME advisory meeting, which was attended by RBI deputy governor Usha Thorat and the heads of leading public sector banks, the RBI also asked lenders to provide adequate credit to large firms to help them make timely payments to MSMEs.        
	Owing to the credit crunch, big corporate houses are delaying payments to small firms for their inventories. This issue came up during the discussion today, a spokesperson for the Indian Banks Association said.        
	Among the bankers who attended todays meeting were Punjab National Bank chairman K.C. Chakrabarty, Union Bank of India chief M.V. Nair and Indian Overseas Bank chairman S.A. Bhatt.        
	Dinesh Rai, secretary to the ministry of small and medium enterprises, was also present.        
	Kolhapur co-op bank        
	The RBI today said it had cancelled the licence of Kolhapur-based Sadhana Co-operative Bank as it had ceased to be solvent.        
	The central bank was forced to take this decision after all efforts to revive the Kolhapur bank failed and depositors were inconvenienced by the continued uncertainty, the RBI said in a press release issued here.        
	Consequent to the cancellation, Sadhana Co-operative Bank is prohibited from carrying on banking business as defined in Section 5 (b) of the Banking Regulation Act, 1949 (as applicable to co-operative societies), including the acceptance and repayment of deposits, the release said.        
	On liquidation, every depositor is entitled to repayment of his/her deposits up to a monetary ceiling of Rs 1 lakh from the Deposit Insurance and Credit Guarantee Corporation under usual terms and conditions, it added.

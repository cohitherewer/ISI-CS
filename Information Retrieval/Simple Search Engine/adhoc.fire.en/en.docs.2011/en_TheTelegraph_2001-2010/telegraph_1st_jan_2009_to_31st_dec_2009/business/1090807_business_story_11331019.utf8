	Calcutta, Aug. 6: ArcelorMittal, the worlds largest steel producer, plans to buy low-cost equipment for its new plants from India and China.         
	Cost of equipment in China and India is cheaper by about 40 per cent compared with Europe. It has been decided that the company will source equipment from these two low-cost Asian countries for almost all its greenfield projects, Pierre Jonette, chief executive officer (design and engineering centre) of ArcelorMittal, said on the sidelines of a programme organised by the CII (eastern region) today.        
	ArcelorMittal is looking to buy boilers and steel structures from India, and blast furnace, coke oven and sinters from China.        
	Jonette said the sourcing from India and China would help the company to bring down project cost by 20-22 per cent. Equipment constitutes nearly 50 per cent of the total cost of setting up a new unit, he said.         
	ArcelorMittal has plans to build two plants  one each in Orissa and Jharkhand  with a combined capacity of 25 million tonnes. Also in the pipeline are plants in Saudi Arabia, Kazakhstan and Brazil.        
	ArcelorMittal chairman Lakshmi Mittal had said last September that the cost of its India projects  initially estimated at $20-25 billion  could rise by about a half because of delays in getting government approvals.

	ArcelorMittal, which has its design and engineering headquarters in Calcutta, is likely to expand the unit over the next 3-5 years. Our headcount at the Calcutta office is likely to touch 250 over the next 3-5 years from 60 at present, Jonette said.

	 Washington/ Beijing, Sept. 12: US President Barack Obama has imposed a 35 per cent additional import duty on Chinese tyres in a bid to protect the domestic market. The move drew the ire of Beijing, which described the measure as protectionist and a violation of the WTO rules. The additional import duty would be in force for three years. However, it would decline by 5 per cent in subsequent years.

	Hyderabad, July 13: Bidding for the Rs 12,200-crore Hyderabad metro rail project will commence afresh on Thursday.        
	The Andhra Pradesh government had cancelled the deal with Maytas Infra, promoted by the kin of Satyam Computer founder B. Ramalinga Raju, for the metro following its failure to reach a financial closure.        
	A new consortium is expected to emerge by November 15, Andhra Pradesh municipal administration minister Anam Ramnarayan Reddy said after a meeting attended by chief minister Y.S. Rajasekhara Reddy.         
	The new consortium will have to complete the project within four years from the date of the financial closure.         
	Ramnarayan Reddy said the government was also assessing the future of other Maytas projects, including the modernisation of Machilipatnam port and other road and irrigation works.        
	Maytas upbeat        
	Maytas Infra directors today said it had put the crisis-ridden company back on the road to stability through intensive review and interactions with stakeholders.        
	A company release said the government nominees, headed by chairman K. Ramalingam, had ensured that credibility was restored among lenders, customers, partners, analysts, various government bodies and the employees.        
	The board had reached out to the top management of leading banks and got the corporate debt restructuring package approved, it said.

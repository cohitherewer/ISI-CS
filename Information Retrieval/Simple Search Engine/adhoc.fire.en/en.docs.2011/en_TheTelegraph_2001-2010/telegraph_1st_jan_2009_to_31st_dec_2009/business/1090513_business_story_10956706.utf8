	Calcutta, May 12: Smart inventory management has helped wire rope maker Usha Martin to post strong growth overseas.        
	The companys subsidiaries in the US, Europe and Asia have doubled profits in the last fiscal though demand fell. Usha Martin has units in the UK, Dubai and Thailand and distribution facilities in Singapore and the US.        
	Profit before tax doubled to Rs 100 crore from Rs 50 crore in the previous year, managing director Rajeev Jhawar said, while announcing the annual results in Calcutta today.        
	The company has followed the just-in-time principle of inventory management; one of its component being to keep the stock at the point of sale, thereby reducing carrying costs.        
	No one wants to enter into long-term contracts. Buyers want to transact at the spot price and take delivery since none is sure of the future, Jhawar said.         
	Usha Martin subsidiaries gained by keeping stocks at the point of sale. This has helped us sell the output. Today it is a great challenge to sell the production, he said.         
	Consolidated net         
	Usha Martin has suffered a 42.9 per cent decline in its consolidated net profit during the fourth quarter of 2008-09 at Rs 28.83 crore on increased foreign exchange losses compared with Rs 50.52 crore profit a year ago.

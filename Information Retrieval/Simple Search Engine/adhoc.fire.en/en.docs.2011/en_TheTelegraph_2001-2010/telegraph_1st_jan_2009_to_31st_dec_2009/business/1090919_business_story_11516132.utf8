The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Hard bargain on AI equity in air
                                                                                                               Hard bargain on AI equity in air

	New Delhi, Sept. 18: The amount of equity the government will infuse into beleaguered Air India will depend on the compromise formula the finance ministry and the ministry of civil aviation work out.        
	The aviation ministry wants an immediate equity infusion of Rs 2,000 crore and subsequent cash injections to take the total amount to Rs 5,000 crore.         
	However, the finance ministry is ready to allow Rs 1,350 crore as equity infusion and is unlikely to agree to nearly a four-fold increase, sources said. It may, however, agree to a compromise increase in funding for Air India, whose current paid-up capital is Rs 145 crore.        
	Air India, which has accumulated losses of Rs 7,200 crore, is also seeking a government guarantee to retire high-cost borrowings that make up Rs 11,000 crore of its Rs 16,000-crore debt portfolio and replace them with cheaper credit. Banks have sought sovereign guarantee to cut interest rates.         
	Officials said the plea to grant the guarantee was likely to go through.         
	In August, the national carrier had unveiled plans to turn around in 24-36 months by shifting more flights to a low-cost carrier model; spinning off cargo, ground handling and engineering units into separate firms or joint ventures; and restructuring its debts.        
	Besides, it sought fresh capital from the government and a renegotiation of incentives and other benefits.        
	Officials said a move by Air India to cut productivity linked incentives, originally expected to come as early as next week, could be delayed because of the festive season. A board meeting to discuss this yesterday was postponed.         
	SBI Caps has chalked out a turnaround plan for the airline, aimed at generating Rs 3,000 crore through internal accruals over the next six months. The plan includes steps to mobilise additional revenue of Rs 1,800 crore through cost-cutting and savings.        
	A committee headed by cabinet secretary K.M. Chandrasekhar had asked the airline to come up with a workable plan before the government allowed any loan guarantees and fresh capital.        
	The carrier had delayed the June salaries of its 32,000 employees and spoken of delaying or cancelling aircraft orders after traffic slumped and debt mounted.         
	Air India has inducted 11 Boeing 777s and 15 Boeing 737-800s in the last two years for its international operations. However, many of these planes are flying with few passengers as global recession takes its toll on air travel.         
	Officials said Air India was now in talks with Boeing and Airbus. We are having a re-look at all the new aircraft, Air India chairman-cum-managing director Arvind Jadhav said.

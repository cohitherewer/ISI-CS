The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Oil hunt fails to excite biggies

	New Delhi, April 7: Oil multinationals are likely to stay away from the bidding for new oil blocks in India later this week as the financial crisis is forcing them to reconsider their plans.        
	Domestic players such as Oil and Natural Gas Corporation, Oil India and Reliance are likely to bid for the 70 blocks to be offered under the new exploration and licensing policy (Nelp).        
	The country is launching the bidding process at a time when global majors such as Royal Dutch Shell, Exxon Mobil and Conoco Phillips have revisited their growth plans and slashed their exploration and production budget.        
	Steel conglomerate Mittal Group, which was developing oil and gas exploration projects with ONGC in Trinidad and Tobago and Kazakhtan, is planning to exit the projects because of the fall in crude prices and the economic meltdown.        
	ONGC Mittal Energy, the joint venture between the Mittal group and ONGC, was developing the NCMA-2 block in Trinidad and Tobago and Satpayev block in Kazakhstan.        
	The market sentiment is not conducive at this point of time. We could expect primarily Indian players to take part in the bids, Arvind Mahajan, energy analyst of KPMG, said.        
	He said most of the blocks that would come up for bidding would be deep and very-deep water blocks, but Indian players did not have the expertise to explore them.        
	However, the geology of the blocks could evoke interest among firms such as Chevron and Exxon Mobil as they are long-term players in the field.        
	Smaller players may find it difficult to finance the project as most of it is equity-based. Besides, the drop in crude oil prices has hit them badly, he said.         
	Crude oil prices have fallen from a high of $147 a barrel to about $50 at present.        
	BHP Billiton and British Petroleum had only participated in Nelp VII, even though Chevron and Exxon Mobil were actively involved in the road show.

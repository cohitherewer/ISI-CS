                                                                                                               Satyam crisis in control
          OUR BUREAU                          Karnik in Mumbai on Thursday. (PTI)                                  
	Feb. 12: The government today said the crisis at Satyam Computer was over and it would now look for an investor to take over the beleaguered IT firm.        
	The crisis situation at Satyam Computer is over. The next step of the government is to find out some suitable strategic investor who can take care and take over the company, corporate affairs minister Prem Chand Gupta said at an industry function in New Delhi.        
	Guptas views were reflected in the statement of Kiran Karnik, the newly appointed chairman of Satyam.        
	Speaking to reporters in Mumbai after Satyams board meting, Karnik said the company had attained financial stability for the time being and would mortgage land if more funds were needed.         
	We have put out the fire and are now looking at financial stability, he said.        
	According to Gupta, all possibilities are being explored and the acquisition will be done transparently. The board has received a number of takeover offers for Satyam but has not decided on its sale, the minister said.        
	Gupta refused to comment on the suitors of the fraud-hit IT firm. We have not yet formally invited any kind of application. The road map will define what we tend to do.        
	Companies such as Mahindra amp; Mahindra, L amp;T and the Spice group are reportedly in the race to acquire the company.        
	Karnik declined to comment on whether the board had taken any decision on putting the company up for sale.         
	According to sources, the meeting today focussed on the progress of auditors  KPMG and Deloitte  in the restatement of the companys accounts. Karnik said the restatement was taking place,but no time frame could be given for the exercise. Customer retention and employee stability will be the other focus areas of the company now.        
	At a separate function in New Delhi, finance minister Pranab Mukherjee said the government would get to the bottom of the Satyam fraud and bring the guilty to book.        
	Satyam plunged into a crisis last month following confessions of a Rs 7,100-crore fraud by founder B. Ramalinga Raju.

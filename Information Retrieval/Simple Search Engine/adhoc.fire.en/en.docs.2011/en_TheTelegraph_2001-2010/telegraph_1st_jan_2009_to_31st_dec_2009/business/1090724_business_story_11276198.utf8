          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, July 23: Air India has decided to revise its much criticised productivity-linked incentive scheme.        
	The ailing carrier will pay the July base salary in time but has deferred the payment of productivity-linked incentives to its employees for July till August 20.        
	An internal airline circular said: As regards the PLI (productivity-linked incentives) to be paid in July the norms for the company as a whole have to be reviewed and parameters need to be revised. Therefore, payments need to be held till August 20.        
	Productivity-linked incentives account for over 45 per cent of the companys wage bill.         
	According to sources, At the moment, the PLI in many cases is huge, sometimes many times more than the salary and is not always related to performance. We need to restructure the PLI and save costs and make it directly related to performance.        
	For instance, technicians get a salary of around Rs 50,000 per month and a monthly PLI of Rs 1.3 lakh.         
	At a lower level, the PLI makes up 20-30 per cent of the salary. A superintendent with a salary of around Rs 25,000 a month gets a monthly PLI of Rs 9,000-10,000.         
	The state-owned airline has suffered losses of over Rs 5,000 crore during the last fiscal and the management has been given 30 days to come up with a viable revival plan. SBI Caps has been appointed by the government to prepare a growth plan for the cash-strapped company.        
	The airline plans to reduce its manpower cost to the tune of Rs 500 crore per annum by re-examining the wage agreements with various employee unions.

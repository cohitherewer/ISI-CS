The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Roche to buy Genentech 
                                                                                                               Roche to buy Genentech 
                                          
	Zurich, March 12 (Reuters): Roche Holding AG has struck a deal with Genentech Inc to acquire all outstanding shares in the US biotech group for $46.8 billion, or $95 a share, the Swiss drug maker said.        
	After a fierce battle that started last summer, Roche finally clinched the deal to buy the 44 per cent of the US biotech group it doesnt own. Genentechs board had recommended shareholders to accept the increased cash offer. Roche had raised its bid to $93 per share from $86.50 last week, which had restarted talks between the two companies, Roche chairman Franz Humer said.        
	Roche was not forced to pay above $100, like some had initially called for, said Vontobel analyst Andrew Weiss. With this deal, Roche secures itself the operating cash flow from Genentech it does not already own, access to the latters pipeline beyond 2015 and its cash pool of roughly $10 billion, he said.        
	Roches share price was down 1.3 per cent at 143.60 Swiss francs by 0906 GMT, when the DJ Stoxx European healthcare sector index was up 0.2 per cent, having gained in recent days on expectations that the company would get the deal done.        
	Buying Genentech will give Roche control of all revenues for big-selling cancer drugs Avastin and Herceptin, as well as absorbing an attractive portfolio of new medicines.        
	The buyout is the third major deal in the pharmaceutical industry this year, after Pfizers agreement to buy Wyeth for $68 billion in January and Merck amp; Co Incs $41 billion agreed bid for Schering-Plough Corp this week.        
	Major drug makers have been seeking to diversify and reduce their reliance on slow growing traditional prescription medicines, which face patent expiries and falling prices.

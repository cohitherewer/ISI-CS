	New Delhi, Aug. 27: The government today approved a bulk order for power equipment worth Rs 40,000 crore for the new thermal power plants of NTPC and Damodar Valley Corporation.        
	The cabinet committee on infrastructure approved the proposals for induction of supercritical technology through a bulk order for 11 units of 660MW each by NTPC and DVC, urban development minister S. Jaipal Reddy told reporters after the meeting.        
	NTPC will float tenders for procuring the equipment for 11 units within 45 days, he said. The most important condition of this approval is the development of phased indigenous manufacturing of supercritical equipment in the country, Reddy said.        
	The DVC would float tenders for two units of Koderma Phase II.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Aug. 29: The government is expected to infuse an additional equity of Rs 5,000 crore and provide a soft loan to cash-strapped Air India over the next three years.        
	A high-level committee, headed by cabinet secretary K.M. Chandrasekhar, today reviewed the turnaround plan of the ailing carrier and asked the civil aviation ministry to prepare a note on the matter.        
	The note, to be prepared in consultation with the finance ministry, will be ready for circulation in the next seven to 10 days, official sources said after the meeting here.        
	The quantum of the equity infusion and the soft loan could not be confirmed. However, indications are that the airlines equity base, which now stands at Rs 145 crore, will be enhanced by Rs 2,500-5000 crore.        
	While the government will contribute partly, major part of the resource is likely to be mobilised through an initial public offering or issue of infrastructure bonds, the officials said. The cabinet will take a final call on the issue.        
	The government will support the airline to help meet its short and medium-term capital requirements. The committee of secretaries has agreed to increase the equity base of the company. The government will help in getting loans from banks, if required. The airline is comfortable with what the committee has proposed. However, the airlines cost-cutting exercise undertaken so far is not satisfactory. They need to do a lot more, an official said.        
	The national carrier has accumulated losses of Rs 7,200 crore in fiscal 2008-09 and debt exceeding Rs 15,000 crore.         
	It has started negotiating with banks and financial institutions to turn its high-cost debt of Rs 10,000-11,000 crore into low-interest loans. Banks want the airline to get a comfort letter or a sovereign guarantee to convert the debt. The government has agreed to the proposal of the banks, sources said.        
	The committee has made it clear that any assistance from the government will have to be matched by an aggressive cost reduction and a better revenue management by Air Indias parent firm, the National Aviation Company of India.        
	Air India expects to cut its operational cost by about Rs 2,000 crore per annum, besides enhancing its cash flow by 10-15 per cent.         
	The airline aims at saving about Rs 750 crore by rationalising productivity-linked incentives of its 31,000 staff.

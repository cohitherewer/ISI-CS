          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Feb. 5: The government is identifying the private companies whose accounts need to be verified by the registrar of companies (RoC) to prevent Satyam-like deception.        
	Corporate affairs ministry officials said the government would soon order an inspection of the accounts of private companies, including some new telecom licence holders, whose statutory auditors were not satisfied with the way their books were maintained.         
	The inspections will reveal whether the companies have violated any law, based on which the government will decide whether to prosecute the companys decision makers.        
	Following the Rs 7,100-crore Satyam accounting fraud, the government has increased financial vigilance to ensure that most firms comply with the accounting provisions as cited in the companies act.        
	The ministry of corporate affairs, which is scrutinising the ownership pattern of Swan and Loop Telecom, could order a probe into these telecom firms books.         
	The ministry is probing if the Ruia-promoted Essar group has violated existing telecom regulations with regard to its shareholding in Loop Telecom.         
	It is also investigating the existing ownership structure of Swan Telecom, where Anil Ambani owned Reliance Telecom  a rival  could be holding more than the stipulated 10 per cent stake.         
	An inspection is ordered if there are complaints from stakeholders, default in filing annual returns or adverse remarks from auditors, officials of the corporate affairs ministry said.

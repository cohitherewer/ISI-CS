The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Arcelor likely to hold 35% in Uttam Galva
                                                                                                               Arcelor likely to hold 35% in Uttam Galva
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                    
	Mumbai, Sept. 5: ArcelorMittal will hold around 35 per cent in Uttam Galva Steels if the open offer, which opens on Monday, is successful.        
	The worlds largest steelmaker will also have the option to raise its stake in the secondary steel maker at a later date.        
	Ankit Miglani, director (commercial) at Uttam Galva Steels, told reporters here today that the promoters had already signed an agreement to sell a 5.6 per cent stake to ArcelorMittal Netherlands BV.        
	The Mittals will seek to raise another 29.39 per cent through the open offer at a price of Rs 120 per share. The transaction value for a 35 per cent stake is Rs 500 crore, implying an estimated enterprise value of Rs 2,800 crore.         
	The Miglanis had stunned the steel industry on Friday by inducting ArcelorMittal as a co-promoter of Uttam Galva.        
	Miglani said the existing Indian promoters would hold a 40 per cent stake in the company  roughly 5 per cent more than the Mittals if the open offer is fully subscribed.        
	If the open offer isnt successful, the Miglanis will sell part of their stake to ArcelorMittal to ensure that both groups have an equal stake of 22.5 per cent each.        
	According to Miglani, the promoter shareholding will comply with the existing Sebi regulations which stipulate that a minimum 25 per cent must be held by the public.        
	Consequently, the joint holding of the two promoters will not cross 75 per cent.        
	Miglani said ArcelorMittal would have three members on the Uttam Galva board; the Miglanis will also have three board positions. The company will have six independent directors. The agreement gives the two co-promoters joint control rights. As a result, ArcelorMittal will have a say in decisions like equity raising, issue of dividends and so on.        
	Uttam Galva has inducted ArcelorMittal as a co-promoter to gain access to the latest technology and best practices from the worlds largest steel maker. Uttam Galva will also ensure raw material security as it can source hot rolled coils from ArcelorMittal.        
	The deal with ArcelorMittal will ensure raw material security, the supply of high-grade hot-rolled coils, Miglani said.

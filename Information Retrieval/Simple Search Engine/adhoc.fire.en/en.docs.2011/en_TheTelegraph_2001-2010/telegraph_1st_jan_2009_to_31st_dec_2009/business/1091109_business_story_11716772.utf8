	New Delhi, Nov. 8: India is in an advanced stage of negotiating a free trade agreement with Japan, commerce minister Anand Sharma said today.         
	The country is also likely to sign a trade and investment treaty framework with the US during Prime Minister Manmohan Singhs visit to Washington later this month. India has also finalised the draft for the bilateral trade and investment treaty framework agreement and are waiting for the US side to do the same soon, Sharma said.        
	India wants greater market access for drug firms, but Japan has been pressing for a bilateral agreement on government purchases.         
	India is unlikely to agree to a mutually preferential treatment in government procurement as a study by the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development shows that Japan will enjoy an advantage.         
	According to the study, the government procurement market in India is estimated at 5.8 per cent of GDP, translating into around $34.22-billion worth of contracts every year.        
	Officials said if government procurement was included in the agreement, Japanese firms would have to be treated on a par with Indian companies when the government called for bids.         
	However, when the Japanese government places bids, Indian firms will not only have to compete with those from Japan but also from the European Union, the US and South Korea. In drugs, Indian firms are concerned about Tokyos refusal to recognise American certification.

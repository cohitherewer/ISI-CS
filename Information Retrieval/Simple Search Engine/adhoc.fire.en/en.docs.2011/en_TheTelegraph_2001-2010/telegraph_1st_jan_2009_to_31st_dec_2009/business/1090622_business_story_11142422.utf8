          JAYANTA ROY CHOWDHURY                          Social motive                                  
	New Delhi, June 21: The government is banking on the auction of telecom licences and limited stake sales in public sector enterprises to raise the extra money needed for welfare schemes.        
	The higher outlay on social programmes is expected to push the governments expenditure in the coming budget up to about Rs 10 lakh crore, which is around Rs 50,000 crore more than the interim budgets spending plan.        
	Around Rs 30,000-40,000 crore is expected to be raised from the auction of 3G licences. The government is likely to fix the base price for 3G spectrum auctions at Rs 4,040 crore.        
	Telecom minister A. Raja had suggested a lower price, but Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and finance minister Pranab Mukherjee want a higher sum.        
	Officials said the Prime Ministers Office was also in favour of auctioning 2G licences as it would not only make the process more transparent but also help to funnel more funds into social schemes.         
	A limited divestment of government stakes in PSUs is expected to yield up to Rs 10,000 crore. Plans are afoot to sell stakes in Coal India, Bhel and Air India.         
	The government has already cleared the divestment proposals of Oil India and NHPC.         
	Besides, a tax rejig plan is expected to raise another Rs 10,000 crore  the intention is to raise excise and service tax rates to 12 per cent, while providing some concessions to sectors such as textiles and infotech that have been hit by the global recession.         
	According to the Congress manifesto, social welfare plans such as the national rural employment guarantee scheme, cheap food and health insurance for the poor, insurance for disadvantaged groups and farm loan subsidies will get higher allocations.         
	All this requires huge spending by the government.         
	However, the finance ministry has asked various departments to cap their expenses at the levels of the interim budget. The total expenditure of the government was Rs 9,53,231 crore in the interim budget.        
	We have been directed by the finance minister to limit the fiscal deficit to 5.5 per cent, which is what we had pegged it at in the interim budget. So, we need to add beyond the originally calculated receipts, the officials said. Hence, the emphasis on telecom bidding and PSU divestments.         
	The central governments fiscal deficit rose more than two-and-a-half times in a year to Rs 330,114 crore in 2008-09, which is 6.1 per cent of the countrys gross domestic product (GDP).         
	This figure does not include liabilities such as bonds issued to fertiliser and oil marketing companies in lieu of subsidies to cover the difference between the actual and selling prices of these products.         
	If these are added, the deficit crosses 10 per cent of the GDP, the officials said.

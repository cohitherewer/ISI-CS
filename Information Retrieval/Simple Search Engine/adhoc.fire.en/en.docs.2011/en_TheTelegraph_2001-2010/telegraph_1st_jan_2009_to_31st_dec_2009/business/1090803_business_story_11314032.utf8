                                                                                                               Recession causes residences to crop up on Wall Street
          SAMBIT SAHA                                    
	New York, Aug. 2: Investment banker Sunandan Ganguly is hooked to his friend Ryads residence on Wall Street. How he wished he, too, had a condo at the financial district in Lower Manhattan.        
	Its a cool place to be, you know. Anyone would love to have a Wall Street address, Sunandan, who now lives in Jersey City Harborside, says.        
	Sunandan might as well take the plunge  with inventories up, sales down and developers more than willing to negotiate rates, this could be the best time to own a property on Wall Street.        
	The skyline of Wall Street  the famed financial centre of the world, which of late has brought the world economy to its knees  is fast changing with many historic buildings being revamped for residential purposes.        
	According to Streeteasy, a web listing service that hosts information from all major brokerage firms in New York, there are 125 condominiums on sale and 70 for rent in Wall Street alone.         
	If the Financial District the area around Wall Street  is considered, 725 apartments of around 857 square feet are for sale, with median asking prices of $1.095 million.        
	Studio apartments, however, start at $630,000 in properties such as 75 Wall Street that houses the Hyatt Andaz hotel as well as private residences.        
	Sofia Kim, vice-president (research) of Streeteasy, said developers were offering discounts when buyers reached the sales centre.        
	Sales in Financial District is down 55 per cent from a year ago. Inventory of sales listing is up 40 per cent, she said.         
	Rents looked more affordable with a median price of $3,200 a month for a 784-square-foot apartment. There is a lot of interest in properties that cost less than $1 million.        
	However, for someone like Sunandan, closeness to the workplace is a top draw along with the address.        
	His Credit Suisse office is on Madison Avenue, just 15 minutes away from Wall Street. If one works in the downtown area, this can be a commuters dream, he said.        
	Wall Street is close to many weekend attractions. Battery Park and South Street Sea Port are round the corner, while Central Park and the museums are a subway ride away.         
	The area has stores of premium retailers such as Hermes and Tiffany.         
	Manhattan also holds great appeal for the fashion-conscious.        
	Many historical buildings have been transformed to set up residential complexes. Cipriani Club Residence, which occupies an entire block showcasing Greek revival architecture with four sets of Corinthian columns, used to be the home of the New York Stock Exchange, among others.         
	A 25-storied tower on 37 Wall Street showcases Beaux Arts architecture. It was built in 1907 and home to the Trust Company of America.

                                                                                                                 Q amp;A      Voluntary choice
                                I retired in 1996. Since then I have been submitting income tax return though my tax liability is nil. Will I have to continue to file returns every year? My annual income from deposits in post office and bank is Rs 70,000.          D. Banerjee, Salkia
                    I presume that you are now above 65 years of age. For you, the basic income exemption limit for income tax purposes is Rs 2.25 lakh. Your annual income is much less than that. Filing of tax return is voluntary in your case.                                   Under construction      I took a loan for building a house from a nationalised bank in October 2008. The bank is deducting Rs 11,120 every month as EMI since November 2008. My house is under construction. The accountant of my office refuses to provide me any income tax benefit for the repayment of the loan on the ground that my house is under construction. Is he right?        Rabindra Nath Chatterjee, Burdwan
                    The accountant is right. The EMIs start once the construction is completed and the possession is given. Till then, the loan is considered pre-EMI and not as EMI. However, under the provision of the income tax act, all interest payable in the financial year during which the construction is completed is eligible for deduction under Section 24. The total amount of interest paid before that is allowed for deduction in five equal installments beginning from the year in which the construction is completed.                                   Wait and watch      I made an FD of Rs 2 lakh with the SBI for 1,000 days at an annual interest rate of 11 per cent that the bank offered to senior citizens. I opted to receive the interest every quarter. I received an interest of Rs 4,256 in the first quarter. The bank itself admitted that this amount is less than that I should get. It advised me to wait for the next quarter to see if the error is rectified. Should I lodge a written complaint or wait?        C.N. Mukherjee, Salt Lake
                    You should wait and see if the bank has credited in your account the previous quarters shortfall. If they dont, you can make a written complaint and ask for compensation.

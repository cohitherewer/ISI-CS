The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Spurt in inflow of foreign funds 
                                                                                                               Spurt in inflow of foreign funds 
                            
	New Delhi, Oct. 2 (PTI): Overseas funds flow into local stock markets have crossed Rs 60,000 crore (about $12 billion) so far this year.        
	With investments by foreign investors expected to rise in the coming months, the total overseas funds inflow this year could surpass the 2007 figure of Rs 70,000 crore, the highest so far.        
	Foreign institutional investors (FIIs) were gross buyer of shares worth Rs 4,58,371 crore, while they sold equities valued at Rs 3,98,245 crore, resulting in a net investment of Rs 60,125 crore, according to data available with the Securities and Exchange Board of India.        
	In September, foreign investors infused Rs 18,344 crore ($3.8 billion) in the domestic stock markets.        
	The FIIs have put in a lot of money and they dont want to miss the opportunity in a fast growing market like India, said Gajendra Nagpal, chief executive of Delhi-based Unicon Financial Intermediaries.        
	In 2008, FIIs pulled out Rs 52,000 crore from the stock markets and remained net sellers till February. The global economic meltdown created a panic among foreign investors, forcing them to withdraw.        
	The Bombay Stock Exchanges benchmark index sensex has gained over 77 per cent so far this year.        
	On Thursday, the sensex closed flat after alternate bouts of buying and selling. At close, the 30-share benchmark index was 7.71 points higher at 17134.55 points.        
	The broader 50-share Nifty of the National Stock Exchange also held steady at 5083.40 points.        
	Brokers said investors preferred to book profits ahead of an extended weekend.

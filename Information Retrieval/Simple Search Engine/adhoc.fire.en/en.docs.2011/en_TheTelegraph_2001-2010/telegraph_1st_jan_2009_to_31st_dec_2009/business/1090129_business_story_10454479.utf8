   Govt moves CLB on restrictions           OUR CORRESPONDENT                                    
	New Delhi, Jan. 28: The government has moved the company law board to prevent the top functionaries of Satyam, including the independent directors and auditors, in the regime of the disgraced B. Ramalinga Raju from fleeing the country.        
	It is also moving the board to get the functionaries declare their assets.        
	In a petition, the government said that it has come to the notice of the central government that various respondents are either fleeing the country or beyond reach, in order to evade or stall the investigation or the regulatory mechanism put in force by the central government.        
	Declaring all former executives and independent directors, the CFO, the company secretary and auditor Price Waterhouse liable for the fraud, along with Ramalinga Raju and his brother Rama Raju, the government submitted that they be ordered to declare their assets. Last week, the law board restrained the Raju brothers, company secretary G.J. Jayaraman and other key officials from selling or mortgaging their assets without the courts permission.        
	Satyam auditor Price Waterhouse has stepped up its firefighting efforts with the arrival of its global head Sam DiPiazza in the country. Samuel A. DiPiazza, Jr, global CEO of PricewaterhouseCoopers is in India. He is here to discuss the situation in detail and to offer support to the firm in India, a spokesperson for PwC said.        
	Last week, the Andhra Pradesh CID arrested Price Waterhouse partners S. Gopalakrishnan and Srinivas Talluri for alleged falsification of Satyams audit reports. DiPiazza was due to visit the World Economic Forum at Davos.        
	Price Waterhouse said the head of its auditing and accounting unit, Thomas Mathew, would also step down with immediate effect, though he would remain a partner.        
	Mr Mathew had no connection with the audit of Satyam. However, he believes it would be appropriate for him to relinquish his management position, said Price Waterhouse in a statement.        
	Institutional investor Fidelity today bought 1.17 per cent, or 78.86 lakh shares, of Satyam for over Rs 41.15 crore. The bulk deal at an average price of Rs 52.18 was on the NSE.

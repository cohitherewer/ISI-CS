The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | BSNL share bait to woo staff
                                                                                                               BSNL share bait to woo staff
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, July 27: The government has renewed its offer of preferential shares to BSNL employees, who have vehemently opposed a proposal to divest a 10 per cent stake in the PSU through an initial public offer (IPO).        
	In August last year, BSNLs 3,04,000 employees were offered 500 shares each at Rs 10 apiece, as part of a previous move for an IPO. The terms of the offer have not been disclosed this time.        
	The move is an attempt by the government to convince the BSNL employees union of the merits of a listing. The union has been threatening to go on an indefinite strike if the PSU goes ahead with the IPO.        
	Preferential shares can be given to workers, telecom minister A. Raja today said in the Rajya Sabha. He said the ministry was in discussion with the union leaders, but no consensus has been reached on the subject.        
	The BSNL board had cleared a plan to divest a 10 per cent stake through a public float last year to raise about Rs 10,000 crore. BSNL trade union leader V.N. Namboodiri had said, We are opposed to the IPO and any offer of 500 shares is not going to change it. We are not convinced with the argument that a stake dilution is necessary for the expansion, growth and grant of navaratna status to BSNL.         
	Faced with opposition from the unions and the Left parties, the government has shelved BSNLs IPO twice. The company has been rooting for a public listing to raise money to fund its expansion plans. I assure you it is not a question of divestment or privatisation. If it is possible, we can go in for a 10-20 per cent IPO, Raja said today.        
	On BSNLs profit decline, he said the delay in expansion plans because of court cases related to tenders for mobile equipment was a major reason for the poor financial performance.         
	BSNLs net profit fell sharply to Rs 104 crore in 2008-09 from Rs 3,009 crore in 2007-08, a fall of 96.7 per cent. The company is currently involved in a court case against equipment vendor Nokia Siemens, which had alleged an unfair allotment of a tender for 93 million lines.        
	Analysts said BSNL needed a major revamp in branding, marketing and distribution, including reorientation and training of its workforce.        
	Walkout over spectrum         
	The Opposition today staged a walkout in the Rajya Sabha, alleging a monumental scam in spectrum allocation and demanding an inquiry by a joint parliamentary committee.         
	The Opposition had asked whether the Rs 1,650 crore, which the government got as a licence fee in 2007, was a fair sum.        
	Arun Jaitley, leader of the Opposition, said on receiving licences, companies sold stakes to foreign partners at a huge premium, leading to an undervaluation of spectrum. Telecom minister A. Raja lobbed the ball into the court of the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India for not revisiting the entry fee for licences.

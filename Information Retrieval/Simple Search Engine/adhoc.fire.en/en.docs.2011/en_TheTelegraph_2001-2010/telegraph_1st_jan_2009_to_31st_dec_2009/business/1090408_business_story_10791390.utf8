The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Tata Motors to set up facility in Myanmar
                                                                                                               Tata Motors to set up facility in Myanmar
                            
	New Delhi, April 7 (PTI): Tata Motors will set up a heavy truck manufacturing facility with a capacity of 1,500 units per annum in Myanmar.        
	The plant is being set up following an agreement between the governments of India and Myanmar. India had offered a line of credit of $20 million (about Rs 100 crore) to the Southeast Asian country.        
	The two governments had approached Tata Motors to set up the plant under this credit line for the assembly of Tata Heavy Trucks, a Tata Motors spokesperson said, adding that the company was progressing towards implementation of the project. He said the company was in the process of garnering a proper understanding of the project scope.        
	This plant is being planned with a production capacity of 1,500 trucks per annum, but will have provision for ramping up as the demand picks up, he said.         
	The spokesperson, however, did not specify when the plant would be operational.         
	The official said there was no capital commitment from Tata Motors towards the project, which was being entirely funded by the Indian government.        
	Mercedes launch        
	Mercedes-Benz has launched a limited edition of its E-Class cars in India, priced at Rs 43.4 lakh (ex-showroom, Delhi).        
	Mercedes-Benz E-Class is clearly the most sought after luxury car and we have sold over 16,000 units of this car since its India launch in 1996, Mercedes-Benz India managing director and CEO Wilfried Aulbur said. The car will have a three-litre diesel engine and the company will produce only 192 units in this edition.

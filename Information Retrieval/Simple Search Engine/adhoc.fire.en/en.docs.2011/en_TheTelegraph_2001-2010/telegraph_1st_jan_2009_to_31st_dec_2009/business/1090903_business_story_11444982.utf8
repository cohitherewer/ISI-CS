The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Reliance builds case for NTPC gas pact
                                                                                                               Reliance builds case for NTPC gas pact
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Charged state                                  
	New Delhi, Sept. 2: Reliance Industries has asked the government to urge NTPC Ltd to sign the KG gas supply agreement as it would help the power producer to save crores spent on imported LNG and cut the cost of power for state electricity boards.        
	In a related development, the power ministry decided not to become a party to the RIL-RNRL case in the Supreme Court.        
	The government had allocated 2.67 million cubic meters per day (mcmd) of gas from RILs KG-D6 fields to NTPC at $4.20 per million British thermal unit (mBtu), but unlike the 35 other customers identified for the gas, the state-run firm has not signed the gas sales and purchase agreement (GSPA) as yet.        
	In a letter to power secretary H.S. Brahma, RIL executive director P.M.S. Prasad had argued that his company had agreed to sign the GSPA with the caveat that the agreements would be without prejudice to the outcome of the case in Bombay High Court.        
	According to Prasad, NTPC has decided to buy 2.5 mcmd of LNG for 10 years from the overseas market and the delivered cost of this will be $11.2 per mBtu compared with the KG-D6 supply cost of $6.5 per mBtu, leading to a loss of Rs 600 crore per annum. Besides, NTPC buys 3-4 mcmd of LNG on a spot basis, resulting in an additional outgo of Rs 900 crore per annum.        
	NTPC has been allocated KG gas for its Faridabad, Dadri, Anta, Kawas and Gandhar power projects.        
	It is indeed strange that NTPC does not want to discuss the GSPA for Kawas and Gandhar plants even though the ongoing litigation relates to the proposed expansion of both the units. Reliance, therefore, finds this stance of NTPC quite incomprehensible, Prasad said.        
	He rebutted NTPCs claims that the $4.20 price for KG gas (delivered price of $6.54 after adding taxes and transportation) would result in an increase in the cost of power.         
	NTPC remains unaffected by any change in the price of fuel because the cost is passed on to the state electricity boards, Prasad said.

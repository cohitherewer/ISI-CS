The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Centre prefers bonds from IMF
                                                                                                               Centre prefers bonds from IMF
                            
	Washington, April 26 (PTI): India will buy bonds worth around $10 billion (around Rs 50,000 crore) from the International Monetary Fund, The Wall Street Journal said quoting Planning Commission deputy chairman Montek Singh Ahluwalia.        
	If the IMF can issue the securities, its an easy way for us to make a contribution, said Ahluwalia, who is in the US to attend the spring meetings of the IMF and the World Bank.        
	The IMF is finalising plans of its first bond offering and is lining up BRIC countries (Brazil, Russia, India and China) as buyers. The bonds will be sold to the central banks, and not to individual investors.        
	Ahluwalia said the buying of bonds was a better alternative than giving a loan to the IMF like Japan. Separate government approval is not required for the Reserve Bank of India to purchase and hold bonds in its reserves.         
	Fund-Bank meet        
	The International Monetary Fund and the World Bank met today and spoke of providing aid to the developing countries battered by the global financial crisis.         
	The primary agenda of the joint meeting was the fallout of the crisis that began in the advanced economies and is now affecting the most vulnerable countries.         
	The African countries are among the most vulnerable nations, who have slashed investment and credit flows, jeopardising development gains, especially on poverty reduction.

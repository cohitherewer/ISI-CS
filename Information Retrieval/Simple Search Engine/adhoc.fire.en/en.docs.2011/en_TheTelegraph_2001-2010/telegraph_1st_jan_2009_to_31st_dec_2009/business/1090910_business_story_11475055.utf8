The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Price pressure to prompt policy U-turn
                                                                                                               Price pressure to prompt policy U-turn
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Subbarao: Shift in stance                                  
	Mumbai, Sept. 9: The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) is expected to tighten monetary policy by early next year as the spectre of inflation looms.        
	Bankers expected governor Duvvuri Subbarao to roll back the liberal monetary policy he had ushered in last October by nudging up the cash reserve ratio (CRR) which would immediately suck money out of the financial system.        
	Subbarao told Dow Jones newswires in Geneva yesterday that India could reverse its easy monetary policy sooner than the rest of the world even as G20 central bankers huddled to discuss a co-ordinated unwinding of the stimulus measures they had taken last year to beat the global financial crisis.        
	After the CRR hike, bankers expect Subbarao to raise the reverse repo and the repo rates as well.        
	The repo is the rate at which the RBI provides funds to banks against the government securities they hold. The reverse repo is the rate at which it absorbs liquidity. CRR is that portion of deposits that banks must maintain with the RBI.        
	Economists have divergent views on the timing of the reversal. Some feel the change will take place only after there are clear signs of growth in the economy, while others reckon that rising inflation will drive policy responses.        
	Kalpana Kochhar, deputy director Asia-Pacific at the International Monetary Fund (IMF), said on Tuesday that at this stage, it was too early to withdraw the monetary accommodative policy followed by the RBI since October until there were clear signs of growth in the economy.        
	The Reserve Bank has already flagged inflation as a major concern once again and some economists expect the policy change by January.        
	In its annual report, the RBI said the continuation of the current policy with its added impact of high money supply growth could fuel inflation in the future, thereby working against any possible recovery ahead.         
	Broad money supply growth during the first quarter of 2009-10 was strong at around 20 per cent, above the RBIs projected trajectory of 17 per cent for the year.

                                                                                                               Coal India to pick advisers for selloff
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          FUNDRAISER                                  
	New Delhi, June 18: Coal India Ltd (CIL) is likely to appoint merchant bankers within a month to sell around 10 per cent of its equity.        
	In about a months time, you will get a clear picture. By that time, they (merchant bankers) will be appointed. We are talking to some of them, Partha S. Bhattacharya told The Telegraph.        
	Coal minister Sriprakash Jaiswal has said the government will divest up to 10 per cent of its stake in the PSU.         
	The coal ministry will also offer shares to Coal Indias employees and to those from whom the company has acquired land for mining.        
	Jaiswal had met finance minister Pranab Mukherjee earlier this week and conveyed his ministrys intentions to divest stake in Coal India. For this, the coal mines nationalisation act needs to be amended.        
	The divestment may face resistance from trade unions. Citu has warned of serious consequences if the government goes ahead with the sale.        
	Officials said Coal India had an equity base of Rs 6,316 crore,comprising shares of Rs 1,000 each.         
	The shares are likely to be split into 100 shares of Rs 10 face value before the IPO. The stake dilution is expected to mop up around Rs 7,000 crore.        
	Coal India, along with its seven subsidiaries, accounts for around 85 per cent of coal production.         
	Production is likely to get a boost as the environment ministry is planning to provide speedy clearances and allow mining in degraded forests.        
	According to Jairam Ramesh, minister for environment and forest, mining will be allowed in all the degraded forests, while it will be prohibited in the medium or heavy-density forests. About 55 per cent of forest land in India is degraded.        
	Ramesh said the country needed to increase coal production to 1 billion tonnes in the next seven years to feed new power plants.         
	Coal India aims to raise output to 520 million tonnes by 2011-12 and 664 million tonnes in the following five years.

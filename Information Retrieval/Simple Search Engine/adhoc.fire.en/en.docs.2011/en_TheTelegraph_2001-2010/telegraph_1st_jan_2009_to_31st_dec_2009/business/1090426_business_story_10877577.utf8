          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                            
	Mumbai, April 25: ICICI Bank saw its net profits tumble for the first time since it turned into a commercial bank in 2002, reflecting just how badly the economic slowdown had roiled its performance in the past 12 months.        
	The countrys second largest commercial bank reported that net profit in the fourth quarter (January-March) slumped 35.3 per cent to Rs 743.76 crore from Rs 1,149.84 crore in the corresponding period last year.        
	The net profit figure for the quarter was way below analyst estimates. Observers had expected ICICI Bank to report a lower bottomline; the consensus estimate was around Rs 800 crore.         
	Net profit for the full year dipped almost 14 per cent to Rs 3,578 crore compared with Rs 4,158 crore last year.        
	The drop in net profit was not the only cause for concern. Non performing assets (NPAs), or loan defaults, also grew. Gross NPAs of the bank in absolute terms shot up to Rs 9,649.31 crore for the quarter, up from Rs 7,579.54 crore in the same period last year. Net non-performing advances or those after provisions rose to Rs 4,553.94 crore (Rs 3,490.55 crore) during the quarter.         
	Bad loans surged even though the bank had deliberately started slowing down growth in advances in the middle of last year when the first signs of trouble loomed.        
	In line with the strategy of prioritising capital conservation and risk containment, the loan book decreased marginally to Rs 218,311 crore as on March 31, 2008 from Rs 225,616 crore as on March 31, 2007, the bank said.        
	ICICI Bank is the third private sector bank after Axis Bank and HDFC Bank to come out with its numbers this week. The other two banks beat analysts estimates.        
	ICICI Bank blamed the lower net profit on a higher effective tax rate. Tax expenses shot up to Rs 327.16 crore from Rs 193.33 crore in the same period last year.        
	Net interest income (NII)  or the core income of the bank  rose marginally during the quarter to Rs 2,138.84 crore from Rs 2,079.46 crore in the same period last year. For the year, NII grew 15 per cent from Rs 7,304 crore to Rs 8,367 crore.

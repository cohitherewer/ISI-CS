                                                                                                               Hint of tax on imports to help local steel 
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                          Steel minister Virbhadra Singh in New Delhi on Friday. (PTI)                                  
	New Delhi, May 29: Steel minister Virbhadra Singh plans to impose an additional tax on steel imports to protect the domestic industry from cheap foreign products.        
	There are demands to take certain fiscal measures to stop cheap imports. The issue has to be addressed immediately, Singh said.        
	Local producers want a safeguard duty to neutralise the threat of cheap imports.        
	A 5 per cent duty is currently levied on imports, but the industry is demanding an additional duty of 20-25 per cent.        
	The minister said he would co-ordinate with other ministries to speed up the clearances of mining licences for steel companies.        
	The ministry of mines will be requested to undertake consequential amendments to the Mines and Minerals (Development and Regulation) Act 1957 to bring the changes to force.         
	The government will expand the production capacity of state-owned Steel Authority of India Ltd and Rashtriya Ispat Nigam Ltd.        
	One of my priorities would be to ensure that these projects are completed on time in a cost-effective fashion, said Singh.        
	SAIL and Rashtriya Ispat Nigam will nearly double their production capacities in the next three years at a combined investment of Rs 70,000 crore.        
	The government is also planning to speed up investment proposals of Rs 11 lakh crore in steel.        
	I intend to set up an appropriate mechanism to expedite investment proposals and statutory clearances, said Singh.        
	A number of foreign investment proposals are awaiting clearance, the minister said.         
	Some 222 initial agreements have been signed by various investors proposing a total investment of Rs 11 lakh crore to create fresh steel manufacturing capacities.        
	The priority of the ministry will be to increase production and consumption and ensure optimal utilisation of raw materials by producers.        
	Our per capita steel consumption is only 46 kg as against a global average of over 150 kg. It would thus be a priority to ensure greater consumption of steel as well as augment production facilities to meet the growing steel demand, the minister said.        
	According to World Steel Association figures, production in India grew 1.01 per cent in the first quarter of the calendar year, while global steel output fell 23 per cent.        
	Stressing the need for restructuring smaller public sector units, Singh said, there is a need for restructuring some of our smaller PSUs and attempting mergers to capture the benefits of improved synergies.

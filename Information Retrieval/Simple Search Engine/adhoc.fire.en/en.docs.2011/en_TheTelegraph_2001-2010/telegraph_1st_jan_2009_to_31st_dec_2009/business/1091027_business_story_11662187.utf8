The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | ING to split into two
                                                                                                               ING to split into two
                            
	Amsterdam, Oct. 26 (Reuters): ING Group NV, the Dutch bancassurer, will split in two, shrinking itself into a smaller Europe-focused bank.        
	The company will also pay back 50 per cent of the aid it received from the Dutch state early and launch a 7.5 billion euro ($11.25 billion) rights issue.        
	Mondays surprise announcement from ING, which said the dismantling was expected to run through 2013, accelerates a move that investors had expected, but not for years to come.         
	ING shares fell almost 9 per cent to 10.63 euros at 0950 GMT, as analysts expressed doubts about ING tapping the market with a rights issue of nearly 30 per cent of its market capitalisation.

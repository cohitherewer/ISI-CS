          OUR BUREAU                          P. M. Telang in Mumbai on Thursday. (PTI)                                   
	Mumbai, May 28: Tata Motors is in discussions with the Jharkhand government to build a vendor park on over 300 acres.        
	The company plans to invite vendors to set up shop in the park so that it can easily source components for the trucks it makes in Jamshedpur. Talks with the state are at an initial stage, said a Tata Motors spokesperson.        
	The new format in the automobile industry provides for a vendor facility close to the manufacturing unit, the spokesperson said.        
	Whether it was Singur in Bengal  where the company exited in the face of political opposition, Pantnagar in Uttar Pradesh, or the proposed site for the Nano in Sanand, Gujarat, a vendor unit situated in close proximity of the manufacturing facility has been a part of the plan.        
	In Jamshedpur, while there are vendors close to the truck facility, Tata Motors is keen to invite vendors from other states to Jharkhand.        
	On Thursday, Tata Motors unveiled a range of trucks comprising multi-axle trucks, tractor-trailers, tippers, and special application vehicles.         
	The trucks will be available in the second quarter of this fiscal, Prakash M. Telang, executive director (commercial vehicles), said.

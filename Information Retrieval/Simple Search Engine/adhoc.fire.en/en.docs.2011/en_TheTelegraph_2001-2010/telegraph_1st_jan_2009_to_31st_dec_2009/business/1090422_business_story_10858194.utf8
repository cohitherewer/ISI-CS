          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                                  
	Mumbai, April 21: The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) today trashed some of the excuses trotted out by banks for not fully transmitting the benefits of periodic cuts in the policy rates to their customers.        
	Some of the banks apprehensions are valid and some not, RBI governor Duvvuri Subbarao said today while emphasising that there was scope for banks to further reduce lending rates.        
	Since October last year, the central bank has cut the repo rate by 400 basis points and reverse repo by 250 basis points. Today, it brought down both these key short term rates by another 25 basis points each. The repo is the rate at which the RBI provides funds to banks against the government securities they hold and reverse repo is that at which it absorbs liquidity.        
	While nationalised banks have reduced their benchmark lending rates by 125-225 basis points, private sector banks brought down their rates by 100-125 basis points. Foreign banks have capped their cuts at 100 basis points.        
	Moreover, the current deposit and lending rates are higher than in 2004-07, although the policy rates are lower.        
	Bankers have come up with at least four reasons for soft-pedalling on the rate cuts.        
	First, they argue that the small savings rates  basically postal deposit rates and National Savings Certificates and others of the same ilk  serve as a rate floor for bank deposit rates.        
	The main worry of bankers here is that if they bring down deposit rates, money will flow to these small savings. Since banks cannot trim their deposit rates, they cant ease lending rates either, creating a typical Catch 22-like situation.        
	Second, when interest rates were rising, bank customers broke their low-interest deposits prematurely and parked them as fixed deposits at higher rates. When the overall rates started sliding, they didnt break these deposits  forcing banks to carry them till maturity.        
	Third, the mandatory requirement of banks to lend at concessional rates to the farm sector and exporters left them with little flexibility to trim overall lending rates.        
	And finally, the huge borrowings by the Centre  projected to rise to Rs 3.98 lakh crore this fiscal  have only hardened interest rates.        
	However, the central bank is not convinced by these explanations.         
	Subbarao said the RBI had conducted some studies internally and had determined that the apprehensions expressed by bankers were exaggerated.        
	The RBIs contention is that small savings and bank deposits are not perfect substitutes and, therefore, banks should not be apprehensive about reducing deposit rates for fear of competition from small savings particularly at a time when liquidity in the system is highly comfortable.        
	In a comfortable liquidity situation, banks are not hard pressed to raise funds from deposits by offering high rates.        
	Subbarao said the lending rates were decided on the basis of three factors: bank margins, interest rate paid to depositors, and the rate of inflation. He said the RBI study had found that even after taking these factors into account, the lending rate should not be higher than 10 per cent. However, the effective lending rate of domestic banks is far above 10 per cent and, therefore, there is scope for a cut in lending rates.

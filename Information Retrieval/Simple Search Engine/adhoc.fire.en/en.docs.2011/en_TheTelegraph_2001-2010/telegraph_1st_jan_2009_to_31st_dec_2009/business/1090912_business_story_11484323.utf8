The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Spectrum overcomes defence hurdle
                                                                                                               Spectrum overcomes defence hurdle
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                               
	New Delhi, Sept. 11: The defence authorities have agreed to vacate 5-10 megahertz (MHz) of spectrum in the 2.1 gigahertz band for 3G.         
	The decision was taken today at a meeting where cabinet secretary K.M. Chandrasekhar, defence representatives and telecom officials were present.         
	While a specific date on spectrum release has not been set, it has been decided that defence forces will vacate around 5-10 MHz of 3G spectrum before the auction takes place, an official of the department of telecom said.         
	The auction of 3G spectrum  used for high-end services such as video conferencing, high-speed Internet access and mobile downloads  is expected to take place by the year-end and telecom operators are keen to start the service by October next year.         
	Last month, an empowered group of ministers (eGoM), headed by finance minister Pranab Mukherjee, had fixed the reserve price for a pan-India 3G licence at Rs 3,500 crore. The eGoM had also decided to restrict the number of players in each circle to five, including one slot for PSU firms BSNL and MTNL.         
	The meeting also chalked out a road map for the completion of the nationwide optic fibre network, which will be used by the defence forces once they vacate spectrum         
	It was decided that part of the optic fibre system would be operationalised by the end of 2010, officials said.

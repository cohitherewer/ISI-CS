          SAMBIT SAHA                              
	Calcutta, Oct. 5: Maharashtra, Chhattisgarh or even Karnataka may emerge as alternative locations for ArcelorMittals proposed plant in India if it decides to move out of Jharkhand and Orissa.        
	The company had planned to build two 12-million-tonne plants at a cumulative investment of $20 billion. Industry had expected at least one of the projects to take off in the near term.        
	Mittal had chosen Jharkhand and Orissa as the states are endowed with iron ore and coal reserves but had failed to envisage the discontent that land acquisition could entail.        
	Industry observers feel Chhattisgarh and Karnataka would be two obvious alternative choices for Mittal as the states have good iron ore deposits.        
	Maharashtra may also emerge as a potential location as the state is the biggest consumer of steel.         
	Moreover, ArcelorMittal has its only manufacturing presence in India in this state through Uttam Galva, a cold roll and galvanised steel maker. Mittal had become the co-promoter of Uttam Galva last month.        
	However, acquiring vast tracts of land  between 7,000 and 8,000 acres  would still be difficult in any of these three states.        
	Chhattisgarh, which has high-grade iron ore deposits compared with Karnataka, has failed to offer land to Tata Steel for its greenfield project.        
	The existing plants of NMDC or Essar Steel have suffered frequent attacks from Maoist rebels in the state as well.        
	The iron-rich Bastar region is home to large tribal population, which is fiercely opposed to displacement for industrial projects  a situation similar to Orissa and Jharkhand.        
	Acquiring land in Maharashtra could be tricky too as Reliance Industries found in case of its Raigad SEZ project. However, both Karnataka and Maharashtra have proactive governments, which may make land acquisition less troublesome.        
	Some industry observers feel the time has come when steel companies should stop making iron ore mines and coal deposits the main criteria to decide on a new plants location.        
	Land and water are the two most critical components. Whichever state provides that, the plant will be built there. Raw materials can still be transported but not land and water, said an expert.        
	JSW Group had followed the same logic when it chose Bengal for a 10mt steel plant even though the state has no iron ore deposits.        
	JSW has acquired close to 4,500 acres and has access to water too. It has been allocated coal blocks but it decided to procure iron ore from private players.

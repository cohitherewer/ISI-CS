	Mumbai, Aug. 31: Trading in interest rate futures  an instrument used as a hedge against rate risks  commenced on the NSE today.         
	An interest rate futures contract is an agreement to buy or sell an underlying debt instrument at a fixed date in the future at a specified price.         
	The instrument had been introduced once before  in 2003  but soon got shelved.        
	The trading got off to a good start as over 10,000 contracts were struck in two hours.         
	Though interest rate futures were reintroduced a year after currency futures, it is expected to overtake it in trading volume. Previously, in 2003, they were priced in relation to a zero-coupon yield curve, which was complex. They are now based on 10-year government security with a notional coupon of 7 per cent.

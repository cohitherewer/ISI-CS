	Seoul, June 6: Koreas LG Electronics is chalking out plans to launch a wide range of home appliances in India that are high on wellness features. The firm is targeting 15 per cent of its revenue from these new products.         
	Some of the products in the pipeline are washing machines with steam technology and baby care system, refrigerators with green ion door technology, microwave ovens with nutrition care menu options and 3G cyclotron plasma air-conditioners, which ensure 30 per cent improved dust collection performance.        
	LG says the range is health driven and greener.         
	Globally LG is trying to introduce products for health-conscious people. Our research says that in the last decade, Asian people have spent a considerable amount on health-related products. We are, therefore, going to focus a lot on this segment in the future, said Simon Hahm, LG Electronics Asia vice-president (air conditioners).         
	The products were first launched by LG in Korea last year.         
	LG India says it will soon manufacture 80 per cent of these products in India. It also plans to import some parts from Korea and China.         
	The company registered a turnover of Rs 10,730 crore in 2008 and is targeting revenues of Rs 13,000 crore in this calendar year. The company will invest about Rs 80 crore in launching products across the consumer durables and home appliances category this year. We would also like to see exports from India grow 50 per cent year-on-year, said Hahm.        
	In a major environment initiative in refrigerators, LG is planning to replace the R-22A gas in India with R-410A, which is used in Europe.

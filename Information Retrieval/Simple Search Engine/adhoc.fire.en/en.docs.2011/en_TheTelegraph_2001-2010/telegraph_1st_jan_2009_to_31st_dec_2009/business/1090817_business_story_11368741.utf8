The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Govt steps up share scrutiny 
                                                                                                               Govt steps up share scrutiny 
                            
	New Delhi, Aug. 16 (PTI): The government has decided to set up a research wing to scrutinise media reports, corporate press releases and advertisements, which can have a bearing on the share prices of companies.        
	The research unit, to be set up within the Serious Fraud Investigation Office, will provide early signals of corporate wrongdoings to the government, a senior official of the corporate affairs ministry said.        
	He said the new unit would work in close co-ordination with the Securities and Exchange Board of India, the Enforcement Directorate, the income tax department and the Reserve Bank of India.        
	Media reports aimed at inflating the share prices of companies or those suggesting siphoning of funds by promoters through a stake sale would be a good fodder for us to keep an eye on those entities, the official said. The decision to set up the unit was prompted by the Satyam scam.

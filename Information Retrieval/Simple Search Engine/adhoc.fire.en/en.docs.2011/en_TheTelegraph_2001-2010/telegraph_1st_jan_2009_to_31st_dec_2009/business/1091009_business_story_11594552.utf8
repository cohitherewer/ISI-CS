	Calcutta, Oct. 8: JSW Energy may bring in anchor investors before its initial public offering next month.        
	The company is planning to allot 18 per cent of the issue size  which amounts to Rs 540 crore  to the investors.         
	Our merchant bankers are in dialogue with both domestic and international investors. However, firm talks will happen once we get a go-ahead from market regulator Sebi, Krishna Deshika, joint group CFO of JSW, said.        
	Anchor investors get an assured placement of shares and the price offered by them helps in determining the issue size. The investors are free to sell the shares within 30 days.         
	Deshika expects a good appetite for the IPO as the company is an established player having a combined power capacity of 995MW. Another 435MW will be generated by the end of this financial year. JSW Energy, part of the Sajjan Jindal-owned JSW group, hopes to raise up to Rs 3,000 crore from the IPO.         
	Bengal plans        
	The company plans to achieve financial closure for the 800x2MW Salboni plant by October next year, which will help to kickstart the Rs 35,000-crore integrated steel and power project of the JSW group.        
	However, the steel unit will take off only in 2011-12 after the expansion of JSW Steels Vijaynagar plant in Karnataka is completed. The Telegraph had reported on June 18 that the construction of Jindals steel plant in Bengal would not begin before 2011, the year of the state elections.        
	The power plant will provide a lifeline to the Bengal project that has got delayed. We are dividing steel and power into two companies, kicking off with power. Steel will follow. I am hoping the first phase of the 3-million-tonne steel plant will be completed by 2014, synchronising with the power plant, Biswadip Gupta, joint MD and CEO of JSW Bengal, said.

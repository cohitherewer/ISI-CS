The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | ATF price hiked 
                                                                                                               ATF price hiked 
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, April 15: Jet fuel prices rose again today, but airlines were unlikely to raise fares.         
	We are studying the situation and will take a call at an appropriate time, said an Air India spokesperson.         
	According to sources, airlines may not hike fares as they fear a drop in the number of passengers. Domestic air travel in the first three months of this year has witnessed a sharp fall with the number of passengers declining by almost 12 per cent over the same period last year.        
	State-owned oil firms today hiked jet fuel prices by an average of Rs 2,000 per kilo litre, or about 6.7 per cent, making it the third such increase in a month.        
	Rising crude prices are pushing up the price of jet fuel. Crude had fallen to $35 per barrel in December, but is now at the $50 level.        
	In Calcutta, jet fuel will cost Rs 39,801 per kl against Rs 37,744, previously.

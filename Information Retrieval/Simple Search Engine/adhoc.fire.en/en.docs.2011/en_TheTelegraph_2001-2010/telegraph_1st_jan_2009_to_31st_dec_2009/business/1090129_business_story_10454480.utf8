	New Delhi, Jan. 28: The parliamentary panel investigating the Satyam case today met for the first time since the Rs 7,800-crore fraud came to light and questioned the Reserve Bank, Sebi, the corporate affairs ministry and the Central Board of Direct Taxes about their findings.        
	The panel, headed by Ananth Kumar, has decided to call the representatives of the Reserve Bank of India again on February 4 along with three other government agencies, including Sebi, for a second round of quizzing.        
	Todays meeting, which started with the questioning of the RBI, represented by governor D. Subbarao and deputy governor Usha Thorat, remained inconclusive. According to sources, the RBI was asked about its clearance to Price Waterhouse, the auditors of Satyam.         
	In 2003, the RBI had banned Price Waterhouse for three years from auditing the accounts of banks after the collapse of Global Trust Bank. Price Waterhouse audited the banks accounts.        
	Subbarao told the panel that the suspension could not be indefinite and the ban was lifted after three years.

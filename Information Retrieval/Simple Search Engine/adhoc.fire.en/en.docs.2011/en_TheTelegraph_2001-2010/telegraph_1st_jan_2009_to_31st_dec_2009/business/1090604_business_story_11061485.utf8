                                                                                                               RIL German unit in trouble
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                            
	Mumbai, June 3: Trevira  the German speciality polyester maker that Reliance Industries acquired in 2004 for 80 million euros (about Rs 430 crore)  has filed for insolvency in a Bavarian court.        
	The move will kick-start a process of restructuring at the textile company which has been roiled by the global recession.        
	The process is similar to the Chapter 11 filing for bankruptcy protection in the US, which a number of companies, including General Motors, have used.        
	Under German law, a company files for the launch of insolvency proceedings when its losses or debts exceed its assets, or if it is unable to meet payment obligations.         
	Under this system, the company would be placed under an administrator and subsequently restructured. The restructuring may also involve the sale of assets.        
	In a statement today, Reliance said Trevira had filed an application with the Augsburg court in Bavaria, Germany for the commencement of insolvency proceedings with a restructuring plan.        
	The move came after the company had made a number of efforts to overcome the impact of industrial slowdown in Europe, particularly in the automotive and textile sectors to whom Trevira is an important supplier.        
	European textile manufacturers are facing a considerable drop in demand for their products, while the cost of production and employment is increasing and competition from Asian and eastern European industries is stronger than ever, RIL said.        
	Trevira manufactures high-value branded polyester fibres and filament yarns for the automotive industries, home textiles as well as for technical applications. The company has production units in Germany, Denmark, Poland and Belgium.        
	Trevira was expected to provide Reliance a strong foothold in Europe.

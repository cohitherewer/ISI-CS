The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Tatas, Suzlon to go abroad for funds
                                                                                                               Tatas, Suzlon to go abroad for funds
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Dollar chase                                  
	Mumbai, July 20: Tata Steel and Suzlon Energy are collectively planning to raise around $600 million through Global Depository Receipts (GDR).        
	The move comes just three days after Sterlite Industries raised $1.5 billion through American Depository Shares (ADS).        
	The development signals that domestic companies are once again confident of raising funds from overseas markets.         
	Several companies are also planning to tap the local primary market which has been energised by the recent flotation of Mahindra Holidays amp; Resorts and Adani Powers plans to come out with a bumper IPO this month.        
	Although details on the proposed GDRs are sketchy, it is learnt that Tata Steel is planning to raise at least $400 million with an option to raise another $300 million.        
	Officials from the company were not available for comment.        
	The Tata Steel GDRs are likely to be listed on the London Stock Exchange. It is learnt that one GDR will be equivalent to one share. JP Morgan and Citigroup are lead arrangers for the Tata Steel flotation.        
	Tata Steel, which is now the worlds sixth largest producer of steel after the acquisition of Corus, is likely to use most of the funds in its UK operations. In May, Tata Steel UK, a 100 per cent indirect subsidiary of Tata Steel, had received lenders approval to reset the covenants in its 3.7 billion acquisition-related senior debt facility.        
	Suzlon Energy, the wind turbine maker, is also set to launch its $100-million GDR issue which will be listed on the Luxembourg Stock Exchange. One Suzlon GDR is equivalent to four underlying shares.        
	It is learnt that the company has an option to raise another $70 million. Officials from Suzlon were, however, not available for comment.

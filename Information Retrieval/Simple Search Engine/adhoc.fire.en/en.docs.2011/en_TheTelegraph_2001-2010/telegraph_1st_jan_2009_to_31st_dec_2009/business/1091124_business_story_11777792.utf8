          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Nov. 23: Maruti Suzuki India will launch a van this fiscal to replace the Versa  a multi-purpose vehicle whose production has been stopped.        
	Maruti is also planning fresh investments at the Gurgaon and Manesar plants. A board meeting scheduled for January will consider the issue.        
	Our next board meeting is still two months away. We are internally discussing fresh investment proposals, but a final decision will be taken at the board meeting (in January), said I.V. Rao, managing executive officer for engineering at Maruti Suzuki India. He was speaking after a conference on environment-friendly vehicles. The firm has capacity of 9.2 lakh cars a year.         
	Sale of Maruti cars grew 25 per cent during April-October 2009 to 5,58,332 vehicles.         
	The company is looking at producing one million vehicles by the end of this fiscal        
	Hopefully, we will have one million units in production by the end of this financial year by utilising our full capacity, Rao said.        
	Toyota unit        
	Japanese auto major Toyota is mulling an engine and transmission unit.        
	The unit may come up at its second facility in Bangalore.         
	Toyota wants to use more local components to cut costs.        
	An engine and transmission plant will help the company to increase localisation from the current level of 50 per cent.        
	The company has a joint venture  Toyota Kirloskar Motor (TKM)  with the Kirloskar group for India.         
	In order to localise production I am very keen to set up a transmission and engine unit in the second plant, said Hiroshi Nakagawa, managing director of TKM.        
	Senior officials, however, did not say if both petrol and diesel engines would be made in India.

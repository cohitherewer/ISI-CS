The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Promoters sell 4% of Suzlon
                                                                                                               Promoters sell 4% of Suzlon
          OUR BUREAU                              
	Mumbai, May 25: The promoters of Suzlon have sold around four per cent in the company to fund the buyout of REpower Systems from Martifer Group.        
	A company statement said the promoter Tanti family sold around 60 million shares, or about four per cent of the paid-up share capital of the company.        
	The fund raised through the stake sale will be used primarily to advance inter-corporate deposits through promoter group entities to the company to part finance the buyout of the stake held in REpower Systems AG by Martifer SGPS, Suzlon Energy chairman and managing director Tulsi Tanti said.        
	Pune-based Suzlon is in the process of acquiring Hamburg-based REpower Systems and has agreed to pay 270 million euros to buy Martifers 22.4 per cent stake.         
	After the stake sale, the promoter shareholding in Suzlon stands at around 60 per cent.        
	This stake sale will ensure that the overall timeline for implementing REpowers integration is not delayed, Tanti said.         
	He said the promoter group did not envisage the need for a further stake sale in the future.

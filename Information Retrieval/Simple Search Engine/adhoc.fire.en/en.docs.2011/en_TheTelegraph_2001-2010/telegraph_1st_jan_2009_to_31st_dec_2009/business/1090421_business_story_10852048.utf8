                                                                                                               Sharma enters, Nayak exits Axis
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Mumbai, April 20: The exodus of chieftains at the ICICI group has sparked a controversy at Axis Bank.        
	P.J. Nayak, chairman and CEO of Axis Bank, today opposed the appointment of Shikha Sharma as the new managing director and CEO of the bank.         
	Nayak was overruled by the nine other directors of the bank who backed Sharmas appointment. Nayak, whose term ends on July 30, said he would be leaving the bank.        
	Sharma is the managing director of ICICI Prudential Life Insurance. Her exit from the ICICI group comes after Chanda Kochchars elevation to the rank of managing director and CEO of ICICI Bank. Kochchar assumes the post from May 1.        
	It could not be ascertained why Nayak opposed the appointment of Sharma who was credited with turning ICICI Prudential Life Insurance into a formidable private insurance player.         
	Officials from Axis Bank preferred not to comment on the development, and Nayak was unavailable.         
	However, sources say Nayak is in favour of appointing Hemant Kaul who is now the executive director at Axis Bank.        
	Shikha Sharmas appointment will be subject to the approval of the Reserve Bank of India and shareholders of the bank. She will hold the post for a period of five years.         
	Sharma, an MBA from IIM Ahmedabad, began her career with ICICI in 1980.        
	She has been instrumental in setting up various group businesses, including investment banking and retail finance.         
	The changes at Axis Bank came after the RBI had earlier stipulated that the post of chairman and CEO of the bank should be separated into non-executive chairman and managing director from August 1.        
	Ramnath quits         
	Renuka Ramnath today quit as the CEO and managing director of private equity player ICICI Ventures. Her resignation has been accepted by the board.         
	Vishakha Mulye, chief of ICICI groups general insurance business, was named the head of ICICI Ventures with effect from tomorrow. Shares of ICICI Bank fell nearly seven per cent on the New York Stock Exchange today.

                                                                                                                           6                                                                                        Q amp;A      Wealth worry
                                In the current financial year, my total asset value will be around Rs 33 lakh. What will be my net wealth tax? Who shall I pay the tax?           Bijoy Goel, Calcutta
                    Wealth tax is charged every year in respect of net wealth on the valuation date of every individual, Hindu Undivided Family and company at the rate of 1 per cent of the amount by which the net wealth exceeds Rs 30 lakh. Net wealth means the aggregate value of assets specified under the act minus the total debt owed by the assessee in relation to the said assets. For payment of the tax, contact your ITO ward/circle office. You shall also have to file return of net wealth in a specified Form BA.                                  Deed dilemma      My wife and me are both senior citizens. We bought a flat in a housing society and got it registered in 2007. Now that we want to collect the registered transfer deed, my advocate says that we shall have to pay an extra mount because the land value has gone up. However, we havent received any demand notice from the registry office.        A.S. Dass, Calcutta
                      Contact the registrar of the office where you had registered the title deed. He/she will tell you whether you shall have to pay the extra amount or not. If the valuation of the land registry office is higher than what you have shown in the property transfer deed, you shall have to pay the difference through a demand draft from the State Bank of India.                          Deposit options      I am 73-years-old. My income in the 2009-10 financial year will exceed Rs 2.4 lakh after the receipt of some arrear pension payments. Can I deposit the amount exceeding Rs 2.4 lakh in 5-year term deposits of post offices or in Senior Citizen Saving Scheme to claim deduction?        S.K. Mazumdar, Salt Lake
                    Yes, you can claim deduction of tax on investments up to Rs 1 lakh in post office term deposits (five years or more) and/or Senior Citizen Saving Scheme.

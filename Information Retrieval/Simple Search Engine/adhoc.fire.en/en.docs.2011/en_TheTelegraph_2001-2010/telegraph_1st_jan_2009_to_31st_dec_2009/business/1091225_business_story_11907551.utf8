	New Delhi, Dec. 24: The ambiguity over the identity of private banks such as ICICI and HDFC arising from Februarys revised foreign investment norms will be resolved soon, commerce minister Anand Sharma said.        
	Following the revised norms, some private banks had become foreign-owned but Indian-controlled entities because foreign investments in them were more than 50 per cent, barring their arms from investing in some segments having FDI caps.        
	Talks are being held with the finance ministry and the RBI and a final view to remove any ambiguity will be taken soon. could be before the end of this month, Sharma said.        
	Sources said the government was contemplating either to keep banks out of the scope of the norms or make special provisions for them.        
	Press Notes 2, 3 and 4 announced on February 11 had widened the definition of FDI to include foreign institutional holdings, NRI investments, depository receipts such as GDRs and ADRs, foreign currency convertible bonds, convertible preference shares and convertible currency debentures.        
	Soon after the norms were announced, the RBI had said that ICICI Bank, ING Vysya, YES Bank, HDFC Bank, Development Credit Bank, IndusInd Bank and Federal Bank would get labelled as foreign-owned but Indian-controlled entities.        
	The RBI has reportedly informed the department of industrial policy and promotion that the control of a company, not just its ownership, should be taken into account while determining foreign investment.         
	The central bank also said ADRs, GDRs and foreign currency convertible bonds should be kept out of the calculation of FDI as these do not have voting rights.        
	ADRs in ICICI Bank on September 30 were as high as 29.86 per cent that take the foreign investment holding in the bank to almost 65 per cent.         
	Sharma today released a draft of all 177 press notes for comments from the public; a final version would be released in two months.        
	He said the rules from now would be reviewed every six months.         
	November FDI        
	FDI in November stood at $1.74 billion, an increase of over 60 per cent from $1.08 billion received a year ago.        
	Amid a global credit crunch, it is for the second month in a row that the inflows have seen impressive growth.         
	October witnessed a 56 per cent jump at $2.3 billion. Increase in FDI flows shows the attractiveness as an investment destination. Now it is time for us to simplify the procedures, Ficci secretary-general Amit Mitra said.

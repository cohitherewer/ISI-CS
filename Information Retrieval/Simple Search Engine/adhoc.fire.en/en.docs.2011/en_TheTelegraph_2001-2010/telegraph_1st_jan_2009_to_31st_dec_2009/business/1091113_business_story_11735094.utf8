          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Nov. 12: Sikorsky Aircraft and Tata Advanced Systems today formed a joint venture to manufacture aerospace components.        
	The new venture will manufacture parts for the Sikorsky S-92 helicopter cabin and supply to other aerospace original equipment manufacturers.         
	The venture will operate from a second greenfield facility to be set up in Hyderabad, next to the cabin assembly building.         
	The facility is expected to be completed by 2011 and will commence production by 2012- end.         
	India is certainly a key aerospace region, and we are thrilled to team with the Tatas and help serve and grow the business there, said Mick Maurer, senior vice-president (operations) of Sikorsky.         
	This is part of our strategy to participate meaningfully in this space, and to enhance Indias capacities, said Davinder Kumar, CEO of Tata Advanced Systems.         
	The joint venture agreement builds upon a long-term contract signed in June 2009 by the two firms to assemble Sikorsky S-92 helicopter cabins. Sikorsky is a subsidiary of United Technologies, while Tata Advanced Systems is a wholly owned arm of Tata Sons.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Monnet one up on Orissa Sponge rivals
                                                                                                               Monnet one up on Orissa Sponge rivals
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                            
	Calcutta, Feb. 25: Delhi-based Monnet Ispat has moved ahead in the race to control Orissa Sponge Iron and Steel, a small steel maker in Keonjhar district with substantial natural resources such as iron ore, coal and land.        
	Following an agreement signed yesterday with the promoters of Orissa Sponge, Monnet Ispat will hold a 54 per cent stake in the company, keeping the Sinhal brothers of Bhushan Steel at bay.        
	Niraj Singhal-run Bhushan Steel, the company which plans to set up a steel plant in Bengal, had acquired a 14.84 per cent stake in Orissa Sponge from real estate developer Unitech a few months back. But his estranged brother Sanjay, who had fallen out with Niraj and father Brij Bhushan, surprised the market with an audacious open offer to acquire up to 26 per cent in Orissa Sponge on February 9.        
	He offered Rs 300 per share when the market price was only Rs 165.10. The stock is hitting its upper circuit of 5 per cent daily since January 19.        
	However, while the brothers were squabbling, Monnet quietly gained ground.        
	We have cemented our position in Orissa Sponge. We plan to grow to a million-tonne company to begin with and later expand it to 3 million tonnes, Sandeep Jajodia, executive vice-chairman and managing director of Monnet, told The Telegraph.        
	Orissa Sponge now runs a 250,000-tonne sponge iron plant. It owns 125mt of coal and about 120mt of iron ore. Moreover, it has 500 acres of land.        
	This company will be one of the lowest cost producer of steel in the world, Jajodia said.        
	Monnet along with group firm Mounteverest Trading amp; Investment had bought 5 per cent earlier this year.        
	Yesterday, it bought another 10 per cent from promoters Torsteel Research Foundation in India (TRFI) and Torsteel.        
	Monnet now holds 14.95 per cent of the existing paid-up share capital, and its share will rise to 28 per cent when warrants to TRFI and Torsteel Ltd are converted.         
	Monnet has agreed to buy part of the warrants issued to the duo.        
	Following the conversion of the warrants, TRFI and Torsteel, run by Prasanta Kumar Mohanty, will hold 22 per cent.        
	Ipicol, an Orissa government company which is a co-promoter of Orissa Sponge, will have 4 per cent.        
	So far, Monnet Ispat has spent about Rs 210 crore to acquire the shares. It has also made an open offer for 20 per cent of the enlarged equity of the Orissa Sponge at Rs 310 per share.         
	The offer opens on April 4 and closes on April 23.        
	Irrespective of what happens in the open offer, we are in control, Jajodia said.         
	None of the Singhal brothers could be reached for comment.        
	The Orissa Sponge stock today closed at Rs 282.1, up 5 per cent.

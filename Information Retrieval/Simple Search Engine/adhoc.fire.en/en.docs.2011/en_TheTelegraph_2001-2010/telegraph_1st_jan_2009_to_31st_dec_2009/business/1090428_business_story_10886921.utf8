                                                                                                               Banks make a mockery of gloom   Earnings surge in fourth quarter
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                                   
	Mumbai, April 27: State-owned banks are starting to turn in gravity-defying profit growth figures in the fourth quarter ended March 31, confounding early forecasts that the economic slowdown could wreck their balance sheets this year after a Rs 71,000-crore farm loan waiver last June and an expected surge in bad loans.         
	Bank of Baroda stunned the Street with a 172 per cent leap in net profit in the fourth quarter ended March 31, 2009 at Rs 752.69 crore against Rs 276.44 crore in the corresponding period last year.         
	Indian Bank  which was struggling just a few years ago  also reported a 63 per cent increase in net profit in the quarter at Rs 394.07 crore, up from Rs 241.67 crore in the same period last year.         
	Analysts said the impact of the ongoing slowdown was not reflected in the bottomline of most banks as the good performance was backed by a growth in their other income and treasury gains. Moreover, the asset quality of the banks has not shown any major erosion.         
	The good show by the two banks has raised hopes of other PSU banks, particularly the State Bank of India, announcing a robust set of numbers.         
	Axis Bank and HDFC Bank had earlier reported strong numbers for the quarter, though ICICI Bank last Saturday reported a drop in net profits.         
	Mangalore-based Corporation Bank had also logged in a profit that beat estimates.         
	Bank of Barodas (BoB) net interest income (core income) grew 43 per cent to Rs 1,470.79 crore compared with Rs 1,028.50 crore in the same quarter last year.         
	Apart from a rise in core income, the strong growth in BoBs bottomline also came on account of a 54 per cent jump in other income.         
	Other income shot up to Rs 853.63 crore (Rs 554.63 crore). BoB said other income includes the sale of investments, including profit on sale of investments.         
	In the fourth quarter, the banks income from investment grew to Rs 884.5 crore from Rs 768 crore in the year-ago period.        
	Total income grew to Rs 4,992.41 crore (Rs 3885.70 crore).         
	For the fiscal year ended March 31, 2009, net profit rose 55.2 per cent to Rs 2,227. 20 crore from Rs 1,435.52 crore in 2007-08. Gross non performing assets came down to Rs 1,842.92 crore from Rs 1,981.38 crore.        
	The strong numbers saw BoB shares rising nearly 3 per cent to close at Rs 313.70 on the BSE today.         
	On the other hand, Indian Bank said gross NPAs were down to Rs 459.81 crore from Rs 486.87 crore, while total income grew to Rs 2,148.47 crore (Rs 1,672.85 crore).         
	Analysts, however, feel that the performance of banks has been affected by the economic slowdown.         
	Most of the banks, including the PSU ones, are now giving out a subdued advance growth estimate for the current fiscal and there has been an increase in provisions and amount of restructured loans as well, an analyst said. Many brokerages have a buy rating on banks.         
	For instance, Sharekhan has a buy rating on Corporation Bank, while Macquarie Research has a outperform rating on Axis Bank.

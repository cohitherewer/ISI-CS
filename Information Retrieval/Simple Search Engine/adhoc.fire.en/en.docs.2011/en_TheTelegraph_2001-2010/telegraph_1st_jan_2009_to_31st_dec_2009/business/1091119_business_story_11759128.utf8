          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Pranab Mukherjee in New Delhi on Wednesday. Picture by Prem Singh                                  
	New Delhi, Nov. 18: The country has systems in place to monitor foreign fund inflows  which are over $15 billion so far this year  and will take countervailing measures if the need arises.         
	It is not a matter of concern. We have a system of monitoring the flows. Whenever we find there are some distortions, we can counteract. Therefore, it is not disturbing, finance minister Pranab Mukherjee told reporters at an industry event.        
	Foreign institutional investors have pumped a record Rs 71,979 crore (over $15 billion) into the equities market, which has driven up the rupee against the dollar setting alarm bells ringing among exporters who have been severely hit by recession in the US and Europe. Exports have dipped for 13 straight months and fell 11.4 per cent to $2.5 billion in October.        
	The recession has forced the central banks of the western countries to drive their interest rates down to historic lows forcing foreign funds to flood emerging markets such as China, India and Brazil with dollars.        
	There is a case for some kind of measures to contain volatile flows. There is a huge cost to be borne because of volatile flows that come from overvaluation. A sudden stop or reversal of flows, as seen in 2007, has a far-reaching impact on the domestic credit cycle, Abheek Barua, economist with HDFC Bank, said.        
	However, D.K. Joshi, economist with Crisil, said: There is no immediate cause for concern as the inflow is sustainable and the country has the capacity to absorb the money. The situation in 2007 and now are quite different.         
	FII inflows this year are the highest in rupee terms. Data provided by market regulator Sebi show foreign institutional investors making a net investment of $15.68 billion in this calendar year, just short of $17.7 billion made in 2007. Last year, there was a net outflow of $11.97 billion in equities.         
	Officials said the country was prepared for a sharp rise in inflows but did not anticipate a repeat of 2007 when the government and the central bank had to erect barriers.        
	Analysts said, It is not surprising that the equity markets attracted record investment this time. Weakening of the dollar and a higher rate of return have attracted the investment from FIIs.        
	They said the flow of funds would increase in the coming months with the government talking of a stake sale in public sector units and big spending in infrastructure programmes.        
	Industry chamber Assocham has suggested a tax on foreign funds and moderate deterrents.        
	 Imposing a 2 per cent tax on foreign institutional investors is recommended as has been done by Brazil in the recent past so that possible imbalances in capital market are corrected and India does not repeat the events of 2007, the chamber said.         
	However, Mukherjees statement seems to put paid to the chambers plan.        
	In 2007, the government had placed limits on external commercial borrowings and curbed the use of participatory notes in stocks.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                            
	New Delhi, May 21: Direct tax collections for 2008-09 have missed the target of Rs 3,45,000-crore by Rs 6,000 crore because the economic slowdown has hit the earnings of companies.        
	The government had lowered its target of direct tax collection to Rs 3,45,000 crore from Rs 3,64,000 crore to factor in the effects of the recession and the tax waivers offered to industry.        
	A finance ministry statement, however, maintained that the direct tax mop-up exceeded the previous years collection by about Rs 26,000 crore.        
	Analysts said the decline in collections would put pressure on the government to increase its revenue to meet a ballooning fiscal deficit. This may be a difficult task as the slowdown is expected to continue for some time.        
	The fiscal deficit has widened to 6 per cent of the gross domestic product (GDP), and the Centres market borrowing has crossed Rs 3,00,000 crore in fiscal 2008-09 against the initial projection of Rs 1,00,571 crore.        
	According to official figures, net direct tax collections during 2008-09 were up 8.33 per cent at Rs 3,38,212 crore against Rs 3,12,202 crore in 2007-08.        
	Corporate tax collections rose 10.84 per cent to Rs 2,13,000 crore from Rs 1,93,000 crore in the previous year.         
	Personal income tax grew 9.09 per cent to Rs 1,24,000 crore in 2008-09 from Rs 1,19,000 crore in the previous fiscal.         
	Personal income tax includes fringe benefit tax, securities transaction tax and banking cash transaction tax.        
	Fringe benefit tax collections were up 12.38 per cent in 2008-09 at Rs 7,997 crore against Rs 7,116 crore a year ago. Securities transaction tax, however, declined 36.95 per cent to Rs 5,408 crore from Rs 8,577 crore.        
	Direct tax to GDP ratio has increased to 6.23 per cent in fiscal 2008-09 from 3.81 per cent in fiscal 2003-04 but has fallen from 6.61 per cent in 2007-08.        
	SEZ notification        
	Developers of special economic zones will no longer have to claim refunds on tax paid on services consumed within the tax-free enclaves. However, the services provided by entities outside the zone to units in an SEZ will continue to attract 10 per cent service tax even as they will be entitled to refunds.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Citi hears split call
                                                                                                               Citi hears split call

	New York, Jan. 14: Staggered by losses despite two federal rescues, Citigroup is accelerating moves to dismantle parts of its troubled financial empire in an effort to placate regulators and its anxious investors.         
	Under pressure from the US administration and Wall Street, the financial giant plans to split itself in two, people with knowledge of the plan said on Tuesday, heralding the end of the landmark merger that created the bank a decade ago.        
	But some Wall Street analysts and investors questioned whether the plan, which included the announcement on Tuesday that it would merge its Smith Barney brokerage with Morgan Stanleys wealth management unit, goes far enough to address Citigroups immediate troubles.        
	Vikram S. Pandit took over Citigroup in December 2007 after the tumultuous tenure of Charles . Prince III. He considered Smith Barney, the banks retail brokerage unit, a crown jewel that the bank was unlikely to sell. But US federal regulators pushed Pandit to move faster.         
	Nortel sinks        
	Nortel Networks, North Americas biggest maker of telephone equipment, filed for bankruptcy protection on Wednesday. The filing came a day before the Toronto-based company was due to make an interest payment of about $107 million.

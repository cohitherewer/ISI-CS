                                                                                                               Mixed mood on opening day     Exports shrink 9.9% in November
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                                  
	New Delhi, Jan. 1: The countrys external trade suffered a jolt on the first day of 2009 with exports falling 9.9 per cent in November. This is the second decline in as many months, raising the pitch for a second stimulus package.        
	A falling demand in the US and Europe pulled exports down to $11.5 billion in November from $12.7 billion a year ago. They contracted 12.1 per cent in October.        
	Imports grew 6.1 per cent to $21.5 billion in November, creating a trade deficit of $10 billion. In April-November, exports were up 19.4 per cent to $119.3 billion, while growth in the first half of the fiscal was 30.9 per cent.        
	Imports between April and November rose 33 per cent to $203.6 billion, raising the trade deficit for the seven months to $84.3 billion from $53.1 billion a year ago.        
	Analysts said export would be muted going forward as there were no signs of a revival in the US and Europe.         
	A. Sakthivel, president of the Federation of Indian Export Organisations, said the government should increase the import duty refund rates as well as the interest subsidy by 2 per cent for firms in labour intensive sectors such as garment and textile.        
	He also suggested a moratorium on the payment of term loans and income tax holidays for five years.        
	Last month, the Gems and Jewellery Export Promotion Council said the industry had laid off 65,000 workers and might be forced to show the door to a like number in the future. Gems and jewellery export had fallen 34.25 per cent in November.        
	It is feared that the country may miss the export target of $200 billion by 5-10 per cent this fiscal as exporters face payment defaults, price cuts and order cancellations.        
	Last month, the government had announced a Rs 30,000-crore stimulus package, in which it offered a 2 per cent interest subsidy and allocated Rs 1,400 crore more for the technology upgradation fund scheme.         
	In the package, the government had cut excise duties by 4 per cent and raised spending in infrastructure.        
	It raised public expenditure by Rs 1.47 lakh crore through two supplementary demand for grants in Parliament, over and above the Rs 7.5 lakh crore in the budget.

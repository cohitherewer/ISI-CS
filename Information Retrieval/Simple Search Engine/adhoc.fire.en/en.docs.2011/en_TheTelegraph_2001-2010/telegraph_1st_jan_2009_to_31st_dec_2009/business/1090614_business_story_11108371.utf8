	New Delhi, June 13: The South Africa-based Sanlam group, which holds a 26 per cent stake in Shriram Life Insurance, plans to increase its stake in the company to 49 per cent as and when the government raises the FDI limit in insurance.         
	We see moves towards lifting the FDI ceiling from 26 per cent to 49 per cent, said Johan Van Zyl, the CEO of the Sanlam Group. Once the regulatory hurdles are cleared, we will immediately increase our stake in both the insurance joint ventures with the Shriram group, Zyl said and added that the company had already set aside the required capital.        
	Besides the life insurance joint venture, the Sanlam group holds a 26 per cent stake in the general insurance company floated by the Shriram group. Shriram Life Insurance is targeting a new premium income of Rs 1,000 crore in the next three years.         
	The bill to amend the insurance regulatory and development authority act to raise the FDI cap in private insurance companies to 49 per cent is pending in the Rajya Sabha.

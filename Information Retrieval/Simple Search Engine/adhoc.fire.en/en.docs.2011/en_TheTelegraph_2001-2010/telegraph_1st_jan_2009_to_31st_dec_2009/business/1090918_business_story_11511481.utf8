The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Catch in Japan rail corridor loan
                                                                                                               Catch in Japan rail corridor loan
          R. SURYAMURTHY AMP; JAYANTA ROY CHOWDHURY                                            
	New Delhi, Sept. 17: The Union cabinet today cleared a Rs 26,000-crore soft loan from Japan to build the Indian Railways western freight corridor.        
	Controversial conditions are tagged to the loan: the prime contractor for the project must come from the Land of the Rising Sun, and at least 30 per cent of the project equipment must be sourced from Japanese companies.        
	Officials said there was considerable pressure from the Japanese to clear the proposal as quickly as possible.         
	Although the loan will attract an abnormally low rate of 0.2 per cent interest, its terms are being seen as a way of helping the Japanese industry sell costly equipment during recession. Prices of the Japanese equipment could be much higher than what the government might have secured through global competitive bidding.        
	Widespread voter dissatisfaction with the ruling Liberal Democratic partys efforts at a turnaround led to a landslide victory for the opposition Democratic Party of Japan in the general elections held last month.        
	The cabinet approved the loan from Japan for the project that will cost Rs 26,124 crore. The first phase of the assistance is estimated at Rs 17,700 crore for the 920km stretch between Rewari (in Haryana) and Vadodara (in Gujarat). To start with, an engineering services loan of approximately Rs 130 crore will be received, information and broadcasting minister Ambika Soni told reporters.        
	Sources said the Planning Commission and the finance ministry had objected to the loan conditions since they were designed to stymie Indias efforts to get the best available technology and equipment at competitive prices. The dedicated freight corridor will connect Delhis Tughlaqabad and Dadri inland ports with Mumbais Jawaharlal Nehru seaport. It will run through Haryana, Rajasthan, Gujarat and Maharashtra.         
	The high-speed corridor will have industrial enclaves on both sides that will be able to use it to ferry raw materials and finished products. The plan for the freight corridor was hatched during the UPA governments previous term.         
	Railway minister Mamata Banerjee now plans to link Calcutta with this corridor by building a separate eastern freight corridor for which funds have yet to be tied up.         
	The problem with tied loans is that this kind of an arrangement comes with buying equipment at high cost. One may not get the best available technology and a lack of choice in the selection of vendors, Akhileshwar Sahay, infrastructure analyst with Feedback Ventures, told The Telegraph.         
	The loan terms sets conditions for the appointment of consultants who will be either a Japanese or a joint venture with Indian partners where the total share of work of Japanese partners in the joint venture is more than 50 per cent of the contract amount.        
	Officials said that consultants often decided the nature of equipment that would be used in a project and they usually had national biases towards firms they know or have dealt with.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Wal-Mart launch gets delayed
                                                                                                               Wal-Mart launch gets delayed
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          PLANS DEFERRED                                  
	New Delhi, May 25: Wal-Mart, the worlds largest retailer, has deferred the launch of its first Indian cash-and-carry store in Amritsar, scheduled tomorrow, following the violence in Punjab over the death of a Sikh religious leader in Vienna.        
	Due to the tense situation in Punjab, Bharti Wal-Mart is deferring the launch of its cash-and-carry wholesale store, said Arti Singh, the vice-president for corporate affairs of Wal-Mart.        
	On the next launch date, Singh said, Its too early to say when. We have to wait and watch. We hope the situation will settle down quickly and well launch the store soon.        
	Bharti Wal-Mart is a 50:50 joint venture between Bharti Enterprises and the US-based Wal-Mart Stores Inc. The Amritsar store will be the first of the 10-15 planned for the country by 2015.         
	However, Indian consumers wont be able to avail themselves of Wal-Marts everyday low prices. Wal-Marts debut outlet is a wholesale-only operation that will sell mainly to vegetable vendors, hospitals, hotels and restaurants. The Amritsar outlet wont even carry the Wal-Mart brand. The company has named its Indian outlets Best Price Modern Wholesale.         
	Analysts expect Wal-Mart, known for squeezing efficiencies out of suppliers and supply chains, to have an impact on Indias $375bn retail market, which is expected to double by 2015.

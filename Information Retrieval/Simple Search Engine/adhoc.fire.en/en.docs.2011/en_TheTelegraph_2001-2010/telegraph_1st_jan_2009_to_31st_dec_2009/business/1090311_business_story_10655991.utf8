	New Delhi, March 10: Buyers are tilting towards bigger models in the market for second-hand cars.         
	A certified three-year-old Honda City and Chevrolet Optra are now available for Rs 3.5-4 lakh. It is possible to buy a one-year-old Honda City ZX GXi for around Rs 6 lakh, while a new one is priced at Rs 8 lakh plus.         
	A few-months-old Maruti Swift VDi (diesel)  priced at Rs 5.5 lakh  will cost around Rs 4 lakh.         
	While Toyota, Honda and Maruti are already in the business, BMW, Audi and Porsche are gearing up to enter this segment.        
	Undoubtedly, our experience says a majority of prospective buyers who were earlier buying M800 are now largely going for the WagonR, Swift and in some cases even the SX4. With big car companies announcing their plans to enter the second-hand market things may change even more, said Ravi Bhatia, chief general manager, Maruti True value, which sells used Marutis.        
	Skoda Auto India, the Indian entity of the Czech car maker, is also keen on this segment. The company is planning to set up an exchange programme.         
	According to Shubhabrata Saha, CEO of Mahindra First Choice Wheels, During a downturn, people like to redefine value and look at stronger brands offering bigger cars at cheaper prices The presence of more companies in this structured market will culminate in the sales of bigger cars.         
	A survey by JD Power shows that almost 80 per cent of customers who buy a new car intend to sell it within five years. In 2007-08, total new passenger car sales in India were 1.5 million, while used car sales were 1.4 million.

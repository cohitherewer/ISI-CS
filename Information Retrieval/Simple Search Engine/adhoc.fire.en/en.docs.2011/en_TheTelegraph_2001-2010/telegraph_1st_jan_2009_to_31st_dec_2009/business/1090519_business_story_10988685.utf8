The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Selective approach to reforms 
                                                                                                               Selective approach to reforms 
          JAYANTA ROY CHOWDHURY AMP; R. SURYAMURTHY                                            
	New Delhi, May 18: The Manmohan Singh-government, which is set to take charge by the weekend, is expected to speed up reforms in select areas as part of its 100-day agenda.        
	Top officials, who are being sounded out in crafting the agenda, say potential near-term reforms have to be those which are doable and not too controversial.         
	However, the centrepiece of the agenda will remain a fiscal and expenditure stimulus package to revive the economy.        
	On the reforms menu is PSU divestment. The government may sell small stakes in PSUs and list some profitable entities to make them more open to public scrutiny, besides garnering resources from the stock markets.        
	Some disinvestment will take place after the markets have started picking up. We will give a signal in favour of it, said M. Govinda Rao, member of the PMs economic advisory committee.         
	Also on the cards are opening up of pensions to private firms  though in a highly regulated environment  and tweaks in the foreign direct investment regime to allow more money into selected sectors.         
	Things like opening up of insurance, retail and diluting labour standards are unlikely to happen in the immediate future as there is opposition to them from within the Congress itself. It was not just the Left who were opposed to it, said Rao.         
	Open auctions of telecom spectrum and licences, iron ore and coal mines for captive use  and allowing foreign investment in these mines  may get the nod.         
	However, one has to understand that this is what we are advising. Ultimately, it is for the cabinet to accept them or to prune down the list depending on its perception of what the populace would be comfortable with, officials said.         
	Bank consolidation with some PSU banks merging or acquiring other banks is not being ruled out. The opening up of banking to larger doses of foreign equity is unlikely to happen in the near future as the global financial markets are in the doldrums.         
	Rao said the new government would step on the gas in infrastructure projects such as highways and expressways as these yield good results in stimulating the economy.         
	Added Sonal Verma of Japanese securities firm Nomura: We judge that markets need to remain realistic over reform prospects. For any democratically elected government anywhere in the world let alone the worlds largest pushing through structural reforms is always politically challenging.         
	Rather, officials said this would like to start work on a new right to food law which would promise food to all citizens and provide social security to families headed by a single woman as well as to the disabled, elderly, urban homeless, formerly bonded labourers, tribals and dalits.         
	These may not happen in the first 100 days but we can start work on these goals which Dr Singh has spoken of, besides the planned expansion of the National Rural Employment Guarantee Programme and extending it to urban areas, they said.

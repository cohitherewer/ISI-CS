The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Lodha son elected Birla Corp chairman
                                                                                                               Lodha son elected Birla Corp chairman
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Calcutta, Oct. 23: Harsh Vardhan Lodha has been unanimously elected chairman of Birla Corporation, the flagship of the MP Birla group.        
	The development comes after the Company Law Board (CLB) cleared him of charges of mismanagement at Birla Corp levelled by the Birla camp on Monday.        
	The chairmans post had fallen vacant after the death of Harshs father Rajendra Singh Lodha in October last year.        
	The Birla family and the Lodhas have been fighting a legal battle over the Rs 5,000-crore MP Birla empire that Priyamvada Birla had given to R.S. Lodha through a will.        
	The CLB case had held up Harshs ascent to the top post for a year.        
	Profit zooms        
	During the second quarter, cement maker Birla Corp registered a 154.69 per cent rise in after-tax profit at Rs 152.05 crore against Rs 59.70 crore in the corresponding quarter of the previous year.        
	The turnover was Rs 556.31 crore against Rs 431.49 crore reported last year, an increase of 28.93 per cent.        
	The board declared an interim dividend of Rs 2.50 per share (25 per cent) for 2009-10.        
	Meanwhile, the first phase of the de-bottlenecking of cement business has been implemented.        
	The second and the final phase is expected to be completed by the first quarter of 2010-11, increasing the capacity to 7.5 million tonnes per annum.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | R-Com to list tower subsidiary
                                                                                                               R-Com to list tower subsidiary
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                              Anil Ambani with R-Com directors A.K. Purwar (left) and   Deepak Shourie (centre) in Mumbai on Tuesday. (PTI)     
	Mumbai, Sept. 22: Anil Dhirubhai Ambani Group-controlled Reliance Communications (R-Com) has decided on an initial public offering for tower arm Reliance Infratel.         
	The shares on offer will comprise 10 per cent of the paid-up capital of Reliance Infratel, post-issue.        
	Addressing shareholders at the fifth annual general meeting of R-Com, chairman Anil Ambani said, Let me share with you details of a major value creation initiative for our shareholders. We will shortly file the draft red herring prospectus of Reliance Infratel, our passive infrastructure arm, with Sebi.         
	Revenues of Reliance Infratel  which has over 48,000 towers  have grown to Rs 5,000 crore in 2008-2009 from Rs 1,500 crore a year ago. Net profit rose 400 per cent to touch Rs 1,700 crore.         
	Many telecom firms such as Etisalat DB, Tata Teleservices and Aircel use Reliances towers.        
	Today, the occupancy on our towers stands at around 75,000 tenancy slots, a number that is set to more than double in the next three years, Ambani said.         
	R-Com had earlier announced the listing of the tower arm  in February 2008  only to drop the proposal as share markets tanked, globally.        
	Ambani said R-Com would see a significant decline in capital expenditure this year.         
	Despite substantial capital expenditure commitments of about Rs 40,000 crore in just two years, our balance sheet remains strong. We expect our capex to decline significantly starting this year, and continue on a downward trend in the future, particularly in relation to the scale of our expanding operations, he said.         
	The massive capital expenditure made so far, Ambani said, would allow R-Com to generate substantial revenues and free cash flows in the coming years.         
	By the end of the year, R-Com expects to expand its subscriber base to 100 million from 85 million.         
	Over the last two years, the company has more than doubled its asset base to Rs 1,02,000 crore and achieved a net worth exceeding Rs 37,000 crore in 2009.

	New Delhi, May 15: Maruti Suzuki India will expand its diesel engine capacity by about 50 per cent to three lakh units per annum by the end of this financial year.        
	Our current diesel engine capacity is two lakh units per annum and we are expanding it by a lakh, said Mayank Pareek, executive officer (marketing) of Maruti.         
	Indias No. 1 car maker today launched its premium hatchback Ritz. While the petrol versions will cost between Rs 3.9 lakh and Rs 4.8 lakh, the diesel variants will carry a price tag of Rs 4.65-4.99 lakh.         
	The Ritz will comply with Bharat Stage-IV emission norms. It sports a 1.2-litre K-series engine and a 1.3-litre DDiS diesel engine.         
	Of the 7,22,144 units Maruti sold in the domestic market last fiscal, around 1,07,000 were diesel cars.         
	Under the companys current portfolio in India, only two models have the diesel option  the Swift compact and the Dzire. Maruti rolled out the Swifts diesel model in January 2007 followed by the Dzire in March last year. It is expecting a good response for the diesel Ritz.         
	Pareek said Swift diesel buyers had to wait for three months for a car, while it was four to six months for the Dzire.        
	The Ritz has been developed on the platform of the hatchback Swift. The common platform enabled the company to offer the Ritz at a lower price, said Shinzo Nakanishi, managing director of Maruti.        
	Given its pricing, the Ritz may compete with the Swift in the compact segment. However, the company says the Ritz will not affect Swifts sales and vice-versa.        
	There is an 8-10 per cent initial cannibalisation in cases where there are more models in the same segment, but this, too, will bottom out, said Pareek.

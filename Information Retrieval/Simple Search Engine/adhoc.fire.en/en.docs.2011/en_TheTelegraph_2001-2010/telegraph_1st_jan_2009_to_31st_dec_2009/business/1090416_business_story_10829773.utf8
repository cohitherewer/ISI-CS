          OUR CORRESPONDENT                          Bhatnagar: Go-slow                                  
	New Delhi, April 15: ArcelorMittals steel projects in the country may be delayed by two years because of recession.        
	Production will not start before 2014, said Vijay Bhatnagar, CEO of ArcelorMittal India. The worlds No. 1 steel maker had planned to start production from 2012, sources said.         
	Bhatnagar said the company was reviewing costs, but capacity would remain unchanged. For us, India is a very critical destination and the company has decided to invest here in a big way. We are not withdrawing our investments.         
	ArcelorMittal will set up facilities in Jharkhand and Orissa at an investment of $20-25 billion. Both the plants will have an annual capacity of 12 million tonnes (mt) each. Capacity in the first phase is 6mt.        
	Bhatnagar said the company had acquired 1,050 acres in Jharkhand and had begun the process of buying land in Orissa.         
	ArcelorMittal plans to set up a captive port at Barunei Muhan in Orissa located north of the Mahanadi river near Paradip.         
	The port will be used to import raw materials such as coking coal and limestone and export steel from the integrated plants.         
	It is projected to have a cargo handling capacity of 35 million tonnes per annum to be attained in two phases.

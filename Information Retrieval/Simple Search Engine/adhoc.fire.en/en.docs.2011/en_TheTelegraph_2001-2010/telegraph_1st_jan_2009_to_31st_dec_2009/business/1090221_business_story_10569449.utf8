The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | SBI bid to woo car buyers
                                                                                                               SBI bid to woo car buyers
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                      
	Mumbai, Feb. 20: After shaking up the home loan market with an attractive scheme recently, the State Bank of India today roared into the car finance market by offering loans at 10 per cent for a period of one year.        
	The SBI rate is at least 25 basis point cheaper than that offered by other banks. Nationalised banks and those in the private sector now offer auto loans largely in the range of 11 to 13.50 per cent. Until now, the Bank of India had one of the lowest rates on auto loans of up to three years at 10.25 per cent.        
	Like its scheme on home loans, the SBI said the 10 per cent interest rate would be frozen for a period of one year. The interest rate will later be reset after the freeze period at the applicable card rate contracted on the date of sanction under the respective new car loan schemes.        
	While the countrys largest bank did not disclose the interest rates that will be applicable after one year, the SBI at present gives new car loans in the range of 11.50-12 per cent.        
	The new car loans will be on offer for a limited period from February 23 till May 31 across India and the interest rate will be reset on these loans at the contracted rate after June 1, 2010.        
	The most attractive feature in the SBI car loan scheme is that it offers the longest repayment period  84 months  without any advance equated monthly installment.         
	Moreover, the bank calculates interest on loans on daily outstanding balance, which reduces the interest burden on the borrower against the monthly outstanding balance or flat rate basis as charged by a few others.        
	The rate-cut will not only cheer new car buyers but also car makers. The industry has been complaining that banks are not providing enough finance for car purchases.         
	Speaking to The Telegraph, a senior official of the SBI said while the bank currently finances the purchase of over 10,000 cars a month, this number should double under the new scheme. So far this year, we have financed more than one lakh cars. We are now the largest originator of auto loans in the country and we expect a very good response to the scheme, he added.         
	The official admitted that the new car loan scheme was formulated after seeing the interest that its 8-per-cent home loan scheme generated.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Educomp rubbishes rumour, stock dips
                                                                                                               Educomp rubbishes rumour, stock dips
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                             
	Mumbai, Jan. 20: Shares of Educomp Solutions crashed today on allegations about the company fudging its books.         
	Educomp plunged over 9 per cent in intra-day trades, though a detailed denial by the management helped to partially retrieve the situation.         
	On the Bombay Stock Exchange, the scrip closed at Rs 1,969.35, a loss of 6.50 per cent, or Rs 137, over its previous close of Rs 2,106.35. In intra-day trades, Educomp had plunged to Rs 1,915.20.         
	Rumours swirled today about the promoters pledging their shares, manipulation of books for higher profit and diversion of funds.         
	Further allegations were of Educomp, an education solutions provider to schools, showing bogus debtors and paying employees much below industry standards.         
	In a 10-page note sent to the stock exchanges, the company said such false allegations were circulated to create panic. It termed them as malicious and an attempt to mislead investors.         
	Responding to the charges that it showed bogus debtors to get credit from banks, Educomp said its debtor days had fallen from 176 days in 2005-06 to 159 in 2007-08 and this had come down further to 145 as on September 30, 2008.         
	Debtor days are the number of days that a company takes to collect cash from its debtors.         
	The debtor days are determined by the billing cycle as well as the seasonal pattern, Educomp said.         
	The company collects the fees for its services on a quarterly basis. In private schools, the payment is within 30 days of the close of the quarter, making it a 120-day cycle.         
	In government schools, the payment takes between 45 and 60 days after the quarter closes, making it a 150-day payment cycle.         
	Educomp also denied that it shovelled funds into the stock market.         
	Reacting to reports that a sum of around Rs 71 crore had been invested in various subsidiary companies and advances were paid to them without any purpose, Educomp said all these investments had been made in high quality companies.         
	On showing a significantly lower wage bill, sources said Educomp should not be compared to other IT companies as its business model was different.         
	For the year ended March 31, 2008, Educomp had 3,995 employees who were paid Rs 33.85 crore in wages.         
	The sensex today nosedived nearly 230 points amid a sharp fall in Asian stocks, casting a shadow over hopes placed on Barack Obama, who took over as the 44th US President today. Marketmen said investor sentiment was dampened by Royal Bank of Scotlands projection of a staggering more than $40 billion loss for 2008 .

                                                                                                               Nokia plea jams BSNL plan

	New Delhi, June 4: Bharat Sanchar Nigams plan to expand its GSM network has been put on hold till a decision is taken on Nokia Siemenss petition challenging the PSU telecom firms tendering process for the job.        
	Andhra Pradesh High Court, where Nokia Siemens Network filed a petition against the tendering process of BSNL, has asked the latter to hold back the contract to Chinas Huawei till June 10.         
	Huawei has been chosen to roll out the GSM network in the south zone.        
	Nokia Siemens has challenged BSNLs decision to disqualify its bids on technical grounds. It alleges that BSNL may have changed the tender conditions in favour of some of the other bidders. According to Nokia Siemens, the technical deficiencies in its bid have not been explained.        
	Telecom minister A. Raja said he would review the process and ensure full transparency in tendering.         
	Let me first go through the files and only then can I take a decision. But I would not like to interfere with the day-to-day functioning of the PSUs, the minister told The Telegraph.        
	Nokia Siemens has filed similar petitions with the Punjab and Haryana high courts. These courts have asked BSNL to submit its reasons for disqualifying the company.        
	ZTE, Nokia Siemens and Alcatel Lucent had been disqualified from the tender on technical grounds. Huawei was selected to roll out network equipment for the western, eastern and southern zones, while Swedish company Ericsson bagged the tender for the northern and some states in the eastern regions.        
	The Andhra court has also asked the department of telecom to file a response to Nokia Siemenss complaint. Huawei will be a party to the case.        
	The 93-million-line GSM expansion project is the single-largest telecom contract in the world, worth around Rs 30,000 crore.        
	The intelligence bureau, defence and home ministries have also cited security concerns to argue against any Chinese company being given BSNL contracts to provide telecom equipment.

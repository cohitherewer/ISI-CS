The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Debt recast plan fails to buoy Dubai market
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Debt recast plan fails to buoy Dubai market
                            
	Dubai, Dec. 1 (Reuters): Gulf markets dropped again on Tuesday, taking little comfort from Dubai Worlds plan to restructure about $26 billion of debt, while the rulers of Abu Dhabi and Dubai talked up their economic strength.        
	Dubai stocks fell a further 3.6 per cent and the Abu Dhabi bourse lost 5.6 per cent on their second trading day since Dubai asked the creditors of Dubai World for a six-month delay on debt repayments last week. Qatars bourse was also more than 8 per cent lower.        
	State-controlled Dubai World unveiled details late on Monday of its plan covering $26 billion of debt owed by its main property firms, Nakheel and Limitless.         
	Global markets took a pounding when the Dubai news broke last week, though on Tuesday Asian and European stocks were up, following the lead from the Wall Street overnight.        
	Dubais ruler Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid al-Maktoum, who is also the vice-president, Prime Minister and defence minister of the United Arab Emirates, said the global reaction had shown a lack of understanding.         
	We are strong and persistent, he said. Sheikh Khalifa bin Zayed al-Nahayan, president of the UAE and ruler of Abu Dhabi, said the UAE economy was showing signs of growth in the fourth quarter.         
	Dubais troubles could shift political power in the UAE toward oil-producing Abu Dhabi and away from its exuberant neighbour.        
	The Dubai World group, whose total liabilities are estimated at nearly $60 billion, said the restructuring would exclude financially stable units such as Infinity World Holding, Istithmar World and Ports and Free Zone World, which includes DP World, Economic Zones World, P amp; Ferries and Jebel Ali Free Zone.

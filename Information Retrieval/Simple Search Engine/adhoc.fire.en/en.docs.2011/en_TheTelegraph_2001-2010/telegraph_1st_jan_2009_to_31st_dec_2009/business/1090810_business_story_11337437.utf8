The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Maturity time
                                                                                                                 Q amp;A      Maturity time
                                I had purchased some NSC from Lucknow GPO in 2002. It has come up for maturity last year. Can I withdraw the NSC amount from GPO, Calcutta?          Bhaskar Chakrabarty, Calcutta
                    Yes, you can. For this, you shall have to apply in duplicate in plain paper to director (finance) of GPO, Calcutta, at the savings bank account department, requesting him to transfer the NSC payment from Lucknow to Calcutta. Mention the details, such as certificate and registration numbers and the amount of each NSC certificate and your current residential address. Attach photocopies of those certificates. The GPO will give you one copy of the application with receipt acknowledgement. They will then send the application to Lucknow for verification. After the verification, GPO Calcutta will send you a mail. You can then go and collect the money from the Calcutta office. You shall have to carry the mail, the copy of the receipt acknowledgement and the original NSC certificates. The entire process may take a month to 45 days.                                  Daughter dear      I have deposited money to my married daughters account in a nationalised bank. Who will pay the income tax on it?        Avijit Paul, Calcutta
                    Your daughter can show this as a gift from father. In that case, she wont have to pay any income tax. However, she will have to pay tax on the interest income, if her annual income, including the interest amount, exceeds Rs 1,90,000.                                  Free to gift       I am a senior citizen. I want to gift Rs 2 lakh to my daughter. What will be the tax liability and on whom? If taxable, then how can we avoid it?        Narendra Lal Kundu, Hooghly
                    Gift tax has been scrapped. There will also be no tax liability on your daughter on the gift received because she got it from a close relative. However, she will have to pay income tax on the interest. But if you gift her mutual funds or shares or a life insurance cover, she wont have to pay any tax on the maturity amount after one year.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Biyani close to Turtle deal 
                                                                                                               Biyani close to Turtle deal 
          SOUNAK MITRA                              
	Calcutta, May 17: Kishore Biyanis Future Group is expected to complete its stake buy in city-based apparel maker Turtle Ltd within this month.        
	The technicalities of the deal have been finalised, but the paperwork is taking time. However, we hope to formally sign the deal by the end of this month, Turtle director Amit Landsaria told The Telegraph. The two companies have been in talks for quite a few months. A private equity deal usually takes about six to seven months to be sealed, an analyst said.        
	According to the terms of the negotiation, Future Group and Turtle will enter into a strategic tie-up. Future would have a double-digit minority stake in Turtle, Landsaria said, without disclosing the financial details. Future spokespersons could not be reached for comment.        
	Landsaria said once the deal was in place, Turtle would be able to significantly increase its presence across the country by using Futures retail network. Turtle would utilise the Pantaloon stores, since it fits our range of offerings, using the shop-in-shop and other feasible concepts, he said.         
	He said the company was setting up a trouser making unit close to its factory in Howrah in June. This will lower cost sustainability, he said. At present, Turtle outsources trousers from a Chennai-based unit.         
	The company  which currently exports to West Asian nations  plans to enter the European markets this fiscal. At present, exports comprise about 2 per cent of the companys annual revenue.

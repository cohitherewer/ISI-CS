The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Big Three dare IBM on domestic turf
                                                                                                               Big Three dare IBM on domestic turf
          JAYATI GHOSE                                             
	New Delhi, May 10: Indias top three IT firms  Tata Consultancy Services, Infosys and Wipro  have decided to take on global giant IBM for a bigger share of the $5.6bn domestic software services market.         
	The global economic crisis has hit IT spending in the US and Europe, and many Indian software companies are now focussing on the domestic market.         
	Indian companies have traditionally fought shy of the domestic market as the overseas market was more profitable. This has provided IBM with enough room to emerge as the No. 1 software developer in the country.         
	Wipro, the countrys third-largest software group, recently won a Rs 2,500cr contract from Unitech Wireless, pipping IBM, which was also vying for the 10-year deal.         
	The deal, among the biggest domestic IT contracts awarded to date, is the largest for Wipro this year. Previously, it was the Rs 1,182cr contract struck with the Employees State Insurance Corporation two months ago.         
	Wipro, which generates around 22 per cent, or $900 million, of its revenue within the country, expects to increase it to 34 per cent by the end of 2009.         
	TCS also hopes to double its present revenue of $468 million, or 7.8 per cent of the total, from the domestic market in the next four years.         
	Infosys, which earns 1.3 per cent, or $57 million from India, expects domestic revenues to grow to a sizeable proportion in the next two to three years.         
	Research firm Browne and Mohan estimates Indian enterprises to spend almost $5.8-$6 billion on IT services this year compared with around $5.6 billion they spent on software services in 2008.         
	According to IDC India, the domestic market for IT and ITeS is expected to grow at 16.4 per cent annually till 2013.         
	However, analysts said, Indian firms will find it tough to challenge IBMs strengths in offering hardware, software, outsourcing and consulting as an integrated solution to clients.         
	There are companies that are in dire need of just physical infrastructure  a data centre or a network system around India, said Allie Young, an analyst at Gartner. Thats where IBM has the advantage.         
	New York-based IBM has already captured more than 13 per cent of the domestic technology and business consulting services market.         
	Apart from mega outsourcing contracts, worth anywhere between $500 million and $1 billion from telecom firms such as Bharti Airtel, Idea Cellular and Vodafone, IBM remained aggressive when it came to smaller, but strategic deals from companies such as Kotak Mahindra Bank, Tata Sky and HPCL. According to Gartner, TCS has a 9.7 per cent and Wipro a 4.5 per cent share of the $5.6bn domestic market for software services.         
	Infosys, Indias second largest computer services company, has a 0.2 per cent share of the domestic market.

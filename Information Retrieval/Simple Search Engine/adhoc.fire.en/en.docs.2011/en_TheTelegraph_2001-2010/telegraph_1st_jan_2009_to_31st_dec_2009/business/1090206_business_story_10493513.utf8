          G.S. RADHAKRISHNA                              
	Hyderabad, Feb. 5: The Rajus are now in danger of losing control over Maytas Infra.        
	ILFS Trust Company and the other banks which have an exposure to the company have formed a risk team to explore the possibility of a takeover.         
	Maytas promoters have pledged around 11.52 per cent of the company to ILFS for a Rs 80-crore loan.        
	Sources said infrastructure firms such as L amp;T, Gamon and Rithwik Projects, who are the partners of Maytas in various projects, were clamouring for a berth in the risk panel.        
	As the lead member of the team, ILFS is pressing for due diligence and the appointment of an auditor to restate the accounts of Maytas, whose proposed amalgamation with Satyam Computer triggered the chain of events that led to the downfall of B. Ramalinga Raju.        
	ILFS and the other banks are meeting the officials of the Andhra Pradesh government and Maytas officials to discuss the next steps.        
	Earlier this week, Maytas suffered another blow when senior board member C. S. Bansal decided to quit.        
	Sources in Maytas said the company had taken guarantees from 19 banks, including ICICI Bank, Punjab National Bank, the State Bank of India, the State Bank of Hyderabad, the Bank of Baroda, the Bank of India and Allahabad Bank.        
	Maytas has an order book of Rs 42,000 crore  Rs 31,000 crore in Andhra Pradesh and the rest outside the state.        
	For the Andhra projects, Maytas has provided Rs 699 crore towards bank guarantees and offered Rs 419 crore as an earnest money deposit. Work in many of the projects has come to a standstill.        
	Legal notice to Vedanta        
	Maytas Infra has issued a legal notice to Vedanta Aluminum Limited for fraudulently and illegally encashing two bank guarantees worth Rs 64 crore last month and not clearing admitted dues.         
	The guarantees were produced by Maytas for a contract of Vedanta to build a township.         
	Sudheer Mareddi, vice-president (buildings and structures), Maytas Infra, said, Vedanta Aluminium Limited fraudulently encashed our bank guarantees and also did not settle our bills. Vedanta has not issued any termination notice to Maytas Infra as of today.         
	Armed with money that lawfully belongs to Maytas Infra, Vedanta is in talks with other local contractors to complete its project, he said.

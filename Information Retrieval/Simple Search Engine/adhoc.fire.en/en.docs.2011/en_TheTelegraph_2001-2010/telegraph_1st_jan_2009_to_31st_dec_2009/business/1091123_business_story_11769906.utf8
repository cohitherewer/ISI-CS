                                                                                                                           6                                                                                        Q amp;A      Tax query
                                I have two fixed deposits of Rs 6 lakh and Rs 6.4 lakh. The rate of interest on both the deposits is 9.75 per cent per annum. My total interest income, which is my only source of income, exceeds Rs 1 lakh. Can I furnish Form 15G for non-deduction of tax at source?          P.S. Basu, Calcutta
                    Yes, you can. Since your total annual income is less than the basic exemption limit of Rs 1.60 lakh, you can submit Form 15G (provided you are not a senior citizen) for non-deduction of tax at source on the interest payable by the bank.                                  File returns      I am a senior citizen without having any income from business or profession. Is there any income-tax formality that I should comply with while selling an immovable property valued over Rs 20 lakh?         Swapan Mitra, Calcutta
                    Now you dont need to produce a tax clearance certificate to the registration authorities to sell a property. However, you would require a PAN card and you shall have to pay capital gains tax. So, you shall have to file income tax return.                      Gift at a cost      I understand that recipient of gifts in ornaments, consumer durables and land from a non-relative are not required to pay income tax under Section 56(2)(vi) of the Income Tax Act. Is gift of equity shares valued more than Rs 50,000 from a non-relative is taxable?         A. Sarkar, Calcutta
                    The provision has been amended in Finance Bill 2009-10. All movable as well as immovable properties valued over Rs 50,00 and received as gift from a non-relative are taxable.                                  PPF concern      I would like to know whether interest credited to my PPF account is eligible for deduction under Section 80C?         D.K. Saha, Calcutta
                    terest on PPF account is not eligible for deduction under Section 80C under the overall limit of Rs 1 lakh.

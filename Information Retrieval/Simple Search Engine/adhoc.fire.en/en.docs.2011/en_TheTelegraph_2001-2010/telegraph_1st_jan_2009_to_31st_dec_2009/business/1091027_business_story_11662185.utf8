The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Birlas challenge Lodha coronation in high court
                                                                                                               Birlas challenge Lodha coronation in high court
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Calcutta, Oct. 26: The Birlas have filed a petition in Calcutta High Court challenging the Company Law Board verdict allowing Harsh Vardhan Lodha to become the chairman of Birla Corporation, the flagship of the MP Birla empire.        
	The fresh legal salvo seeks to counter last weeks CLB order on all counts, a highly placed source confirmed today.        
	However, the move will not be able to stop tomorrows annual general meeting of the company.        
	The court is closed tomorrow and the Birlas can expect a hearing on Wednesday at the earliest.        
	However, this did not deter the Birla camp, which is fighting a five-year-long legal battle over a will by the late Priyamvada Birla, wife of the late M.P. Birla.         
	Priyamvada had bequeathed all her assets to Rajendra Singh Lodha, father of Harsh Vardhan.        
	R.S. Lodha, who became the chairman of Birla Corporation after Priyamvadas death, died a year ago in London.        
	The latest petition has been filed by five individuals and Rameshwara Jute Mills, a Birla managed company, which also went to the CLB alleging mismanagement at Birla Corporation.        
	The petition will seek to overturn the CLB ruling that allowed Harsh Lodha to exercise voting rights on the promoters stake in Birla Corp. It also allowed him to become the chairman of the company.         
	The CLB did not accept the Birlas demand to supersede the Birla Corp board till the court decided on the inheritance of the assets of M.P. Birla.        
	Both the Birlas and the Lodhas have filed their own sets of wills in court for probate.        
	The CLB order was a temporary setback but we had to accept it. But whether its a probate or a corporate matter, the final decision will come only from the highest court of the country, said a Birla confidant, alluding to the possibility of the case going to the Supreme Court.        
	The CLB chairman, in his order on October 19, said, I find that the petition deserves to be dismissed on various grounds; that the petition is a motivated one for an ulterior purpose of ousting the Lodhas from the management and not for protecting the interests of the company; that there are no materials to come to the conclusion that there are acts of oppression and mismanagement in the affairs of the company warranting grant of any relief.

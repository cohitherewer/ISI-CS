The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Closure shock for JLR plant
                                                                                                               Closure shock for JLR plant
          AMIT ROY                              
	London, Sept. 24: Tata Motors has decided to shut down one of the two JLR plants in West Midlands, UK.        
	The axe will fall either on the factory in Castle Bromwich, where 2,000 people are employed on manufacturing the Jaguar, or its site in Solihull, also in the West Midlands, where 5,000 jobs are involved in building Range Rovers.        
	JLRs chief executive officer David Smith gave the bad news: This is a plan that recognises the impact the economic collapse has had on our business, and at the same time the opportunities that lie ahead for these two great brands.        
	The management of JLR, which is owned by Tata Motors, promised there would be no compulsory redundancies and 800 new jobs would be created at Halewood in Merseyside because of a decision to build a new, lighter and greener Range Rover.        
	Bert Hill, regional officer of the GMB union, said: We are now in a meeting with the company to hear details of their plans. GMB will be opposing everything we have heard so far. We will fight the company on this  of that I have no doubt.        
	After the meeting, Hill spoke to The Telegraph, and said the unions accepted one of the plants would have to go. But the unions would oppose the management on details of the closure which is expected to take place over the next four years.        
	Hill drew a distinction between the Tata group and JLRs British management.        
	Compared with Ford (JLRs previous management), the Tata style of management is different, said Hill, handing Ratan Tata a certificate.         
	The unions had backed Tata Motors when JLRs ownership changed. We have not lost confidence in Tata, it is an excellent, well run organisation. They have put a billion pounds into the business and asked management to do the job but we think the management is bad. We think the management should resign.        
	It will not be easy for workers displaced from one plant to commute to the other, Hill pointed out.         
	The road network is bad and people live near their work.        
	Apart from the jobs directly lost, the community around the closed factory would also be badly affected, said Hill.        
	Many will compare the situation in West Bengal, where a modern car plant was gifted by Tata to the people of Singur  and rejected  and the crisis in the West Midlands where everyone desperately wants to keen open the existing factories but cannot.        
	In a statement, JLR pointed out that the car industry has been through an unprecedented recession. New car sales, including those of Jaguar and Land Rover, are down globally by 25-30 per cent.        
	It explained that the company has already responded with aggressive actions over the past year. Production was reduced by more than 100,000 units; spending and costs were cut; employment reduced by 2,500; and pay frozen and bonuses cancelled. But this was not enough to offset the full magnitude of the downturn and the company swung from profit in 2007 to significant losses over the past 12 months. This was not a sustainable situation.        
	Tucked away was the devastating news: As the company reduces engineering complexity for its new product range, West Midlands manufacturing will transfer from two plants to one by the middle of the next decade, improving efficiency and cost.        
	All is not lost, however.        
	JLR said it would build a new generation of lightweight vehicles, with hybrids and electrification technology which it said will significantly reduce fuel consumption and carbon dioxide emissions.        
	Around 800 million pounds have been dedicated to environmental innovation and the new plan includes building the Range Rover LRX, which the firm pledged would be the smallest, most fuel-efficient Range Rover yet.        
	Halewood is safe, Hill also confirmed.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | HDFC numbers fail to lift mood
                                                                                                               HDFC numbers fail to lift mood
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Mumbai, Jan. 21: The Housing Development Finance Corporation (HDFC) today disappointed the market by reporting a 15.73 per cent fall in net profit at Rs 546.83 crore for the quarter ended December 31, 2008 against Rs 648.93 crore in the year-ago period.        
	Last year, HDFCs profit on sale of investments stood at Rs 103.42 crore. It dropped to Rs 1.50 crore during the quarter under review. There was an exceptional income of Rs 120.94 crore in the same quarter last year. The company has posted a lower net profit for perhaps the first time in the last few years.         
	Though profit before other income and exceptional items rose to Rs 774.51 crore from Rs 652.45 crore last year, analysts were disappointed by the jump in the companys interest costs (interest paid on borrowings), which rose to Rs 2,042.70 crore from Rs 1,315.96 crore last year.        
	Total income during the reporting quarter increased to Rs 2,917.77 crore from Rs 2,046.93 crore a year ago. Loan approvals during the nine-month period ended December 31, 2008, stood at Rs 33,820 crore against Rs 29,376 crore in the corresponding period last year, a growth rate of 15 per cent.        
	Loan disbursements during the nine-month period increased 22 per cent to Rs 27,211 crore from Rs 22,285 crore in the year-ago period.        
	The company said despite the economic slowdown, demand for individual loans remained fairly strong. For the nine-month period, individual loan approvals and disbursements registered a growth rate of 21 per cent and 28 per cent, respectively, in value terms.        
	Gross non-performing loans  defined as loans where the instalments are outstanding for more than 90 days as on December 31, 2008  stood at 1.01 per cent of the loan portfolio against 1.12 per cent a year ago.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Dec. 21: Finance secretary Ashok Chawla today met RBI governor D. Subbarao over prices, precipitating a buzz on some action by the central bank to tame food inflation, which is running wild at almost 20-per-cent levels.        
	Both the finance ministry and the RBI believed shortages were behind the high prices but did not discount the role of speculation aided by availability of funds in the system in generating inflationary expectations.        
	If price decline does not happen in December, early steps can be taken. The RBI can increase interest rates... preferably can reduce liquidity by acting on the cash reserve ratio, C. Rangarajan, chairman of the Economic Advisory Council to the Prime Minister, said.         
	Officials said the RBI was considering an increase in the cash reserve ratio (CRR) or the amount of money banks had to compulsorily hold with the central bank by 0.25-0.5 per cent. CRR is currently at 5 per cent.        
	Another option was for limiting credit to certain sectors, which were suspected of indulging in trade speculation.         
	Last week, Subbarao met finance minister Pranab Mukherjee to discuss some routine issues.         
	However, finance ministry officials said it was to take stock of measures against inflation.         
	Chawla today said the government would not borrow more than the budgeted amount. Borrowing is estimated at Rs 4,51,000 crore in this fiscal against Rs 3,06,000 crore in 2008-09.

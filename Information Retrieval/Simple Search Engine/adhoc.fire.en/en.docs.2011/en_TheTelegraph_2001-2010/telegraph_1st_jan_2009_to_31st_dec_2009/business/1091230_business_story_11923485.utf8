The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | RBI hints at policy tweak to check price
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      RBI hints at policy tweak to check price
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      Gopinath: Mulling options                          
	Mumbai, Dec. 29: Food price inflation could spill over to other areas of the economy and the Reserve Bank of India will soon have to shift its monetary policy to quell inflation and still manage the recovery, deputy RBI governor Shyamala Gopinath has said.        
	Bankers and bond market circles have been speculating on the possibility of a hike in the cash reserve ratio (CRR) as liquidity in the system is high and food inflation is around 20 per cent. CRR is that portion of bank deposits which must be maintained with the RBI. It now stands at 5 per cent.        
	However, the big question is whether the RBI will choose to wait till January 29 when its policymakers hunker down to review monetary policy or announce some containment measures sooner.        
	Addressing a seminar organised by the Bangalore Chamber of Industry and Commerce on December 28, Gopinath said there was a risk that high inflation in essential commodities could affect inflation over time and give rise to generalised inflation.        
	The near term policy challenges are clearly conditioned by the evolving growth-inflation outcome that supports shifting the balance of policy focus on managing the recovery and on containment of inflation, she said.        
	Gopinath added that due to the dominance of food price inflation in shaping the overall course of the inflation path, the policy challenge would be to address the supply constraints. However, since supply shocks take time to taper off, it could affect inflation expectations.        
	Gopinaths comments impacted bond prices with yields on the most traded January 2020 bond rising by around 6 basis points to 7.62 per cent.        
	The RBI deputy governor said that effective assessment of the inflation process, and using monetary policy actions at the right time would then be critical to enhance the effectiveness of the policy measures taken by the government and the central bank to bring the economy back on its rails.

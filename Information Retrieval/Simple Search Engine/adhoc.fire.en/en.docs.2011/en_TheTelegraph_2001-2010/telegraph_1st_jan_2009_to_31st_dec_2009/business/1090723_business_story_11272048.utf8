          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Azim Premji in Bangalore on Wednesday. (PTI)                                  
	Mumbai, July 22: The dark clouds over the domestic IT sector seem to be receding.        
	After Infosys and Tata Consultancy Services surpassed Street expectations, Wipro Ltd  the countrys third-largest IT company  surprised analysts today by reporting a 12 per cent rise in profit after tax at Rs 1,016 crore for the first quarter ended June 30, 2009, against Rs 907.8 crore in the year-ago period.        
	Client additions and cost-cutting measures propelled Wipros quarterly revenues to Rs 6,274 crore, a 5 per cent rise over year-ago figure of Rs 5967 crore.        
	We are seeing the first signs of stability in the business as ramp-downs taper off and volumes stabilise, said Wipro chairman Azim Premji.        
	IT services accounted for 77 per cent of the revenue and 93 per cent of the profit before interest and tax in the first quarter.        
	Wipro bagged several multi-million dollar deals, including a nine-year outsourcing contract from Unitech Wireless during the quarter.        
	Wipros IT services added 26 clients during the quarter. We improved on several operating parameters to deliver a margin expansion of 0.6-22.3 per cent in the IT services segment, said Suresh Senapaty, executive director and chief financial officer of Wipro.        
	However, like its peers, Wipro has given a modest-to-flat guidance for the second quarter of this financial year.         
	For the quarter ending September 30, 2009, we expect revenues from our IT services business to be in the range of $1,035 million to $1,053 million, said Premji.        
	Senapaty warned that the company was still cautious about the business environment.         
	On the revenue guidance, a CLSA note said, This implies a growth guidance of 0.2-1.9 per cent quarter-on-quarter which is better than peers.        
	Tech Mahindra        
	Tech Mahindra, which has acquired a 42.7 per cent stake in Satyam Computer, today reported a 49 per cent drop in net profit at Rs 131.62 crore for the quarter ended June 30, 2009, compared with Rs 258.52 crore in the corresponding quarter a year ago.         
	The profit decline is because of the interest burden on debt the company had taken to buy Satyam.

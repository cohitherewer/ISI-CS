The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Fund-raising through equity dips in 2009
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Fund-raising through equity dips in 2009
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                            
	Mumbai, Dec. 13: Fund-raising by companies this year has fallen significantly compared with the preceding two years, particularly before Lehman Brothers went bust in September 2008.        
	According to Prime Database, Indian companies raised Rs 94,151 crore in equity instruments this year, of which around one-third was raised via qualified institutional placements (QIPs) (see table).        
	In 2008, this number was slightly higher at Rs 98,777 crore, while companies raised as much as Rs 1,68,981 crore in 2007. Besides, a large portion of the capital raised this year was used to repay debt and not expand capacities.        
	Its clear that the capital market party did not start this year but we expect it to resume after a gap once the markets open in January, said Saurabh Mukherjea, the Noble Group head of Indian equities.        
	Mukherjea is betting big on the large offerings in the pipeline such as the Rs 10,000-crore Jindal Power flotation.        
	Twenty IPOs have been launched this year compared with 37 in 2008 and 100 in 2007. However, the amount raised by companies from IPOs this year is slightly higher at Rs 19,479 crore against Rs 16,904 crore last year.        
	IPOs are launched once there is stability and buoyancy in the markets. At this point, there is too much nervousness and retail investors are shying away from IPOs since they are still recovering from losses made on previous issues where the listing price was much lower than the offer price, said Prime Database chairman and managing director Prithvi Haldea.        
	Investor response towards recent issues such as JSW Energy and Godrej Properties has been tepid. However, institutional investors are still bullish, and large issues from power, real estate and infrastructure firms are expected in 2010.         
	According to a recent report by UBS Investment on the Indian markets, most of the capital raised by corporates in 2009 was largely a case of de-leveraging. Companies mopped up funds through QIPs and private placements to repay debt.         
	However, that may change next year. In 2010, according to UBS, a large part of the capital will be used for expansion, triggering a demand for raw materials such as steel, cement and services, while increasing capacities to drive earnings in the medium term.        
	UBS is also bullish that earnings growth will revive in 2010 on the back of an expected GDP growth of 9 per cent for 2010-2011.         
	It also expects infrastructure spending to pick up, a continued momentum in consumer spending and benefits for banks from higher credit growth.

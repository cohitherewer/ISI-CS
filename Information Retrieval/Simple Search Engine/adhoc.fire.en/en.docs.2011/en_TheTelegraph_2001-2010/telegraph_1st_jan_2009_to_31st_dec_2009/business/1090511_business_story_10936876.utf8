                                                                                                               Sowing for twilight
        Srikumar Bondyopadhyay helps senior citizens with their investment plan                                            
	Satish Sen retired from his job as a manager with a private firm this month. Hes had a hectic career and has a lot to catch up in life now his books, good music, the saplings in his garden.        
	Satish is good with plants. He sows the seeds in time, waters the saplings regularly, picks out decaying leaves from time to time and when the plant bears fruit, he sits for hours admiring them. His saplings never fail him.        
	Satish has been an equally meticulous investor. His job with a private firm did not entitle him to a pension.         
	So he has been saving regularly for his retirement years. Being a risk-averse guy, he had put most of his savings in bank fixed deposits or government bonds. He had planned to invest his retirement benefits in such investment avenues too. But over the last three months, secured investments have become less lucrative, not that they ever gave fabulous returns.         
	Banks have been slashing rates on deposits, most medium and long-term bond funds have delivered only a fraction of what they did in the previous three months.         
	With the annual consumer inflation rate still hovering above 9 per cent, the real returns from many fixed income instruments have turned negative. This is particularly worrisome for senior citizens like Satish who need a steady flow of income from investments in the absence of a pension.         
	Longer life        
	The life expectancy of people in this country is increasing fast. According to a 1995 estimate, a person born in India was expected to live 58 years on an average. The life expectancy went up to 63.62 years in 2003 and 69.25 years in 2008. The trend is unlikely to reverse in the near future.         
	Therefore, going by the trend, post-retirement, Indians have to live more number of years without a salary or business income than their predecessors. The longer the investment time horizon, the more vulnerable one will be towards interest and inflation rate fluctuations.         
	For example, Satishs five-year bank fixed deposit earned an interest rate of 13 per cent in 1995-96. Now, he can hardly get anything more than 8.75 per cent. Small savings schemes with the post office are no better.         
	But while his savings are earning less, Satishs medical bills and other age-related expenses are rising. Thus, he should view his investment planning differently, including the selection of asset class.        
	Heres some tips for senior citizens like Satish.         
	After retirement at 60, you should first ensure that you get a regular stream of income from investments to meet your monthly household expenditure. Bank fixed deposits, the post office monthly income scheme, Senior Citizen Savings Scheme (SCSS) and annuities are the investment options for this.         
	Bank deposits        
	As a senior citizen, you will get a 0.5 percentage point higher interest rate on your bank fixed deposit. A senior citizen can now get a maximum interest rate of 8.75 per cent on a bank deposit (for fixed deposits up to 10 years).         
	Post office MIS        
	In comparison, the post office monthly income scheme offers an interest rate of 8 per cent and the investment period is six years.         
	However, considering the 5 per cent bonus available on maturity after six years, the overall rate of return works out at 8.83 per cent. This is better than the bank fixed deposit rate of 8.75 per cent.         
	Special scheme        
	SCSS offers a higher interest rate of 9 per cent and any investment up to Rs 1 lakh in this scheme is also eligible for deduction under Section 80C of the Income Tax Act. The investment tenure of this scheme is higher at 15 years.        
	Annuities        
	The advantage of annuities is that you shall get a fixed monthly, quarterly, half-yearly or annual income during your lifetime. There is an option where your spouse can get back the capital investment after your demise. But the returns are the lowest in annuities  between 6.5 and 7.5 per cent at present.        
	Mutual funds        
	Bond and debt schemes of mutual funds also provide a low-risk investment option for senior citizens. But the returns from these schemes are neither regular nor fixed.         
	However, the annual returns from bond/debt funds are generally higher than the bank or post office interest rates (on deposits).         
	Mutual funds fixed maturity plans (FMPs) caught the fancy of risk-averse investors by offering a higher return than bank interest rates. After the debacle in October, FMPs are now made tradable on stock exchanges. Investors in FMPs thus now stand to make capital gains from trading in FMPs on the bourses. But generally, the trading price of an FMP will be lower than its net asset value per unit.         
	This discount will disappear as the FMP approaches its maturity. Besides, the price per unit of an FMP varies with the market interest rate, inflation rate and governments borrowing programme. However, a debt investor needs a superior understanding of market dynamics than an equity investor because debt papers are more complex than equity.        
	Equities        
	There is a general belief that senior citizens should not invest in risky assets such as equity.         
	The probability of suffering a loss on an equity investment depends on the time period of that investment  the longer you remain invested, the lower is the probability of suffering a loss.         
	Given an investment time frame of 10 to 15 years, even senior citizens can have equities in their portfolio. Balanced funds rather than diversified equity schemes are better suited for them.         
	While balanced funds have given an annualised return of 12.23 per cent on an average, debt funds have given a return between 5.89 per cent and 9.37 per cent over the last five years. Balanced funds also provide better liquidity. You can sell your entire or part of holding any time. Debt schemes are mostly close-ended.

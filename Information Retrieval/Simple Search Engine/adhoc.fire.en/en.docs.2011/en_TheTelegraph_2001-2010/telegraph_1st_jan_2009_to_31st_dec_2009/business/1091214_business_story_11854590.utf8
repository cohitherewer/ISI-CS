        Subhash Lakhotia offers a sneak peek into a happy and secure future of your child                                            
	Its a bonny baby! The birth of a child brings with it inexpressible joy and happiness. The parents start weaving dreams of a golden future for the baby. A child also means responsibilities and parents need to start thinking of ways to ensure a secure future for the little one. Education and marriage are some of the primary concerns and the parents have to work out an investment strategy to protect the child against odds.        
	Land bank        
	There are a number of options such as bank fixed deposits and life insurance that parents might consider keeping in mind the future requirement of the child. A wise investment choice is to buy a piece of land in the name of the minor child. Even a plot of agricultural land would serve the purpose. A single piece of land can take care of almost everything that the child would need in the years to come.        
	Cost concern        
	Higher education, particularly in foreign countries, is an expensive affair. Marriage expenses are a major cause for concern. Also, if the child wants to set up his own business after completing his education, he would need a lumpsum amount. The land would be the golden goose to help the child realise his dreams.        
	No tax woes        
	Under the provisions of the Income Tax Act, 1961, the income of a minor is clubbed with that of the parent. However, if you invest in a vacant plot of land booked in the name of a minor child, there will be no clubbing of income. As long as the child is a minor, investment in the piece of land will not produce any income. So, the problem of clubbing of income will not arise.        
	Location logic        
	The location of the plot is important. One should buy land in an area that is not much developed at present but holds tremendous potential over the next 10 to 20 years. Dont buy a plot in a busy residential area. Instead, go for a piece of land on the outskirts of the city that will come at a cheap price but will see a big appreciation over the years to come.         
	If you have more than one minor child in the family, it is recommended that you buy separate plots for each of the child. Though legally one can buy a single piece of land in the name of more than one family member, problems might crop up later.        
	In the case of an agricultural land, keep in mind the future development of the area of your choice. For example, the agricultural land should preferably be in areas where an airport is expected to come up or which hold the promise of industrialisation. It would be a boon if the land is in an area where new highway projects are coming up or if the city is expected to come closer over the next 10 or 20 years.        
	Plan right now for the future of your child. Invest today in a plot of land at a proper location and see its value grow in leaps and bounce. Many a times, the investment made for the children grows much more than the total wealth of the parents. Begin the investment journey for your minor child and let him reap the fruits of your financial prudence when he becomes an adult.

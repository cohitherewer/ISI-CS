The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | ATF to cost more, airlines cautious
                                                                                                               ATF to cost more, airlines cautious
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, March 31: Airlines are unlikely to hike prices despite jet fuel becoming dearer by an average of Rs 2,750 per kilo litre, or about 10 per cent.         
	The slump in demand has made the aviation sector assume a watchful stance to the second upward revision in jet fuel prices in a fortnight.        
	We are studying the situation and will take a call at an appropriate time, an Air India spokesperson said.        
	According to industry sources, the aviation sector was unlikely to hike fares.        
	Jet fuel prices have steadily increased because of global crude prices that firmed up after dipping to around $35 a barrel. It had touched a peak of $145 in July last year.        
	Jet fuel or aviation turbine fuel (ATF) will cost Rs 29,926 per kl or 9.7 per cent more in Delhi from midnight tonight against Rs 27,274.95 earlier. In Mumbai, ATF rates have been raised to Rs 30,785 per kl from Rs 28,023.34, an IOC official said. In Calcutta, prices have been increased to Rs 37,744 per kl from Rs 34,996.08.        
	The prices have been raised as international rates have firmed up in March, the official said. Last fortnight, the oil firms had hiked ATF prices marginally by Rs 158 per kl. Prior to this, jet fuel prices were reduced 11 times since September last year.

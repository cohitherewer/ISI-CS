The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Dunlop to reopen, but doubts linger
                                                                                                               Dunlop to reopen, but doubts linger
          OUR BUREAU                          Welcome move                                  
	Calcutta, March 3: Dunlop has decided to resume operations at the Sahagunj plant in Hooghly from Friday.        
	A notice at the plant gate today announced the managements decision to lift the suspension of work.        
	However, the resumption of work is going to be merely symbolic for the majority of Dunlop workers.        
	Of the 1,189 workers, only 229 are being called initially for maintenance and refurbishment. The rest will have to wait till the company calls them. They will not get their salaries in the meantime.        
	The Dunlop management under owner Pawan Ruia had offered to stop production and cut salary in November, citing a working capital crunch.        
	However, a section of the workers prodded by the Trinamul Congress opposed the plan, though the established unions were willing to accept it. This resulted in the suspension of work by the management that deprived the workers of even the reduced salary.         
	Since the closure, Dunlop had sought a Rs 100-crore bridge loan from the West Bengal Industrial Development Corporation. However, the state agency had declined it.        
	The company today said that some bankers had assured it of working capital. The state government has also informed the company that it was planning to grant the relief and incentives sought by the company.        
	While the Lefts Citu and the Congresss Intuc welcomed the move, the Trinamul Congress union said it would not let the plant open unless all the workers were absorbed and the dues cleared. The Dunlop Workers Union, led by Citu, welcomed the development.        
	If Dunlop reopens from March 6 and all employees of the maintenance department are taken in, we welcome it. We also want that the maintenance staff should be taken first. The other employees should be taken in phases, said Dipankar Roy, general secretary of the union.         
	However, the Dunlop Rubber Factory Union led by Intuc said it was an election stunt.        
	We have not been consulted about the reopening. How come there is no word about the payment of arrears and why should only maintenance staff be taken initially? Only a few days ago Pawan Ruia said he could not reopen Dunlop because of a financial crunch. Then how did he manage the funds so fast? Even if it reopens partly, it may again close down soon, said Bijon Sarkar, joint secretary of the union.        
	Sarkar, however, said the union would not oppose the reopening.        
	Trinamul Congress-led Dunlop Bachao Committee convener Bidyut Raut said We will only allow the factory to reopen if the management takes in all employees and clears October and November, 2008, salaries and previous dues.

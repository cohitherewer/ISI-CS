The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Bengal lags in IT exports
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Bengal lags in IT exports
          SOUNAK MITRA                                            
	Calcutta, Dec. 8: Bengal is slipping on its software export target.         
	Exports last fiscal as a percentage of the countrys total shipment were just 2.74 per cent, which makes it very unlikely that the state will meet the ambitious target of 15-20 per cent for this fiscal.        
	In 2008-09, exports from Bengals software technology parks were Rs 5,129 crore, while its infotech SEZs earned Rs 798.88 crore against the countrys software exports of Rs 216,300 crore.         
	Hopes of making it to the list of top three IT states by 2010 also seem remote.         
	During the first six months of this financial year, exports from Calcuttas software technology park stood at Rs 2,715 crore.         
	On the other hand, exports from Bangalore STP stood at Rs 25,523 crore, while the Mumbai-Pune region contributed Rs 19,739 crore, Hyderabad Rs 15,800 crore, Noida Rs 10,910 crore and Chennai Rs 7,505 crore. Total exports from all STPs in India stood at about Rs 83,436 crore in the first half.         
	State IT minister Debesh Das is, however, upbeat.         
	At a recent meeting, Das had said, The growth of IT in Bengal in 2009 has decreased from that in 2008 because of the global meltdown  it has come down from 45 per cent to 25 per cent. But still, it is 25 per cent  can you name any other industry that has shown such growth in the state last year?         
	Bengals infotech sector has registered a 20 per cent growth in employment during the last year. Though it is less than the expected 35 per cent, 20 per cent is not a very low value, the minister had said.

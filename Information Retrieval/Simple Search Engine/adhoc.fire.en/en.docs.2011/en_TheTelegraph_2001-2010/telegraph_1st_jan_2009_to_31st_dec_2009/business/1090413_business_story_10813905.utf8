The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Jaguar close to 800m loan
                                                                                                               Jaguar close to 800m loan

	London, April 12 (PTI): Jaguar Land Rover of the Tatas is in advanced talks with the British government and banks for a 800-million refinancing that can help the company save 15,000 jobs.        
	The Sunday Times said negotiations were at a delicate stage and hinged on whether the Midlands-based car maker could provide sufficient security to the government and a syndicate of commercial banks  led by the Royal Bank of Scotland and Lloyds  for the loans required.        
	The Tatas are understood to have agreed in principle to invest another 100 million along with the refinancing, the report said.        
	The government has asked for the security in return for guaranteeing the repayment of a 340-million loan from the European Investment Bank (EIB). Directors of the EIB approved the loan last week, but the money cannot be given to Jaguar until the terms of the state underwriting are in place.        
	Last week, Tata Sons may have put its plan for an over $500-million overseas bond issue on the backburner.         
	Investment bankers said a possible support from the UK government for Jaguar Land Rover might have resulted in the plan being dropped.        
	The apex holding company of the $62.5-billion Tata group was keen to raise money to meet the funding needs of group companies which have made several acquisitions overseas, such as Tata Motors which bought Jaguar Land Rover for 1.15 billion last year.        
	The group was then profitable but sales collapsed as the banking crisis deepened.        
	In March, Jaguar sales were down 30 per cent compared with the same month last year, while Land Rover sales were down 37 per cent.

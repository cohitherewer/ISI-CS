	New Delhi, Sept. 27: Japanese electronics major Panasonic is preparing to take a bigger bite out of the Rs 26,000-crore consumer durables market, which is dominated by Korean players LG and Samsung.         
	On the agenda are an entry into new product categories, a manufacturing facility and a research and development (R amp;D) centre. The company is undertaking a very aggressive expansion drive this year. We are doing all that it takes to make our customers happy, said Sabiha Kidwai, general manager (marketing), Panasonic India.        
	The company expects to double its sales turnover this fiscal to Rs 4,500 crore from Rs 2,200 crore last year and increase its market share, said Daizo Ito, chief executive officer of Panasonic India.        
	Panasonic will be setting up a plant by 2011 to make air-conditioners, plasma television sets and refrigerators. Initially, the plans are for an investment of Rs 10 crore, which will be scaled up gradually. It now manufactures home appliances and television sets at its facilities in Gurgaon, Delhi, Noida, Chennai and Vadodara.        
	The company is keen on setting up the new facility in either Haryana or Chennai.         
	Over the next three years, it plans to invest another Rs 30 crore across various product categories.        
	The research and development centre will help it to design products suited to local conditions.        
	Kidwai said Panasonic was aiming to increase its market share in the LCD and plasma TV category to 10 per cent this year from 6 per cent.        
	The initiatives taken by the company to push growth were shaping up according to plan.         
	In the split air-conditioner category, we are aiming to sell 100,000 units this fiscal and reach a market share of 10 per cent. Including the window category, we should be having a total market share of 5 per cent, she said.        
	Industry estimates suggest that LG Electronics India enjoys a market share of 25 per cent while Samsung holds nearly 20 per cent.         
	Panasonic Corporation enjoys a market share of 36 per cent worldwide.        
	The Japanese company is the worlds largest producer of consumer electronics with an annual spend of $5 billion on research and development.

          OUR CORRESPONDENT                                            
	New Delhi, April 29: Bharti Airtel, the countrys largest private telecom company, today reported a 26 per cent rise in net profit for the year ended March 31, 2009 and announced a maiden dividend of 20 per cent.        
	Net profit for the reporting year rose to Rs 8,470 crore on the back of an expanding subscriber base against a profit of Rs 6,701 crore a year ago. The telecom majors revenues rose 37 per cent to Rs 36,962 crore from Rs 27,025 crore .        
	Bharti added 8.3 million mobile users in the fourth quarter, taking its total subscriber base to nearly 94 million or about 24 per cent of the market.         
	For the fourth quarter, Bharti reported a 21 per cent growth in net profit at Rs 2,239.30 crore against Rs 1,852.90 crore in the year-ago period. The companys revenue rose 25.65 per cent to Rs 9,824.50 crore from Rs 7,819.10 crore.        
	Our focus on rural penetration and customer affordability led to strong growth, said Sunil Mittal, chairman and managing director of Bharti Airtel. The India growth story continues and we expect the economy to revive in the second half of this financial year, he added.        
	However, the companys average revenue per user (ARPU) dipped 15 per cent to Rs 305 during the fourth quarter against Rs 357 in the year-ago quarter.        
	Falling ARPU is a result of the promotional free minutes offered by the company, said Sanjay Kapoor, deputy chief executive of Airtel.         
	Bharti Airtel has earmarked a capital expenditure of $3 billion for its infrastructure and tower businesses during the current financial year.         
	We have earmarked a capex of $2 billion for infrastructure and $1 billion for tower business and others, said Manoj Kohli, chief executive officer of Bharti Airtel.         
	The capex does not include its expenditure plans for the expansion of next generation 3G services, Kohli added.        
	The board has declared its maiden dividend at the rate of Rs 2 on shares of face value of Rs 10.         
	The company also announced a stock split, dividing existing equity shares of face value of Rs 10 into two equity shares of Rs 5.        
	The Bharti stock today closed at Rs 749.30, up 3.25 per cent, on the Bombay Stock Exchange.

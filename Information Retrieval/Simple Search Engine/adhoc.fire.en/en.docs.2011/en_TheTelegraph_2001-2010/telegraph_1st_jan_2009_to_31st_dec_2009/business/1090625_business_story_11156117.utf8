	New Delhi, June 24: US hospitality major Starwood Hotels amp; Resorts plans to set up 14 hotels in India that will take its room inventory to 7,500 in the next three years.        
	We will open 14 hotels in India with a total inventory of around 2,500 rooms by 2011-12, said Don Elliot, regional vice-president (India, Bangladesh and Maldives).         
	The hospitality major will set up five Aloft hotels, three Sheraton and six Westin properties.         
	At present, Starwood has an inventory of over 5,000 rooms in 21 hotels across five brands  Le Meridien, Westin, The Luxury Collection, Sheraton and Four Points by Sheraton.         
	In all, the company has about 950 hotels in over 100 countries under nine brands, including St Regis, W, Aloft and Element.        
	On whether the company  which operates on management contract and franchise models  is open to investments and acquisitions in India, Elliot said, It is not our business model, but if something interesting comes by, we may consider.

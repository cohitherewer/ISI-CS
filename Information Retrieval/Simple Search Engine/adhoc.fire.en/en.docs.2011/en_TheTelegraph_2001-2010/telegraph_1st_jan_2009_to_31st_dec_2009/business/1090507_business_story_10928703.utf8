                                                                                                               Essar Steel to invest Rs 1000cr in 3 years
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                                            
	New Delhi, May 6: Essar Steel plans to invest Rs 1,000 crore over the next three years in new steel service centres across India, North America and West Asia. The centres will cater to the automobile, white goods and SME sectors.        
	The investment is part of our strategy to be close to our customer. It will help the company achieve several goals simultaneously, said Shashi Ruia, chairman of the Essar group.         
	While Essar Steel is going ahead with the expansion of its Hazira plant in western India, it is putting on hold new facilities because of the slowing global demand.        
	Plans to build manufacturing units in Vietnam, Trinidad and Tobago, and the US state of Minnesota have been shelved.        
	The annual capacity of the Hazira plant is being raised to 10 million tonnes from 4.6 million tonnes. The expanded capacity is likely to go onstream by June 2010.        
	The expanded capacity at Hazira will be coal-based, while the existing capacity uses nine million standard cubic metres a day of natural gas, said J. Mehra, CEO of Essars steel business group.        
	The steel maker expects to produce 4.5 million tonnes of saleable steel in the current fiscal, up from three million tonnes for the year ended March 31, 2009. Production was lower in the last financial year due to fuel shortages and forced shutdowns related to low demand, said Mehra.        
	Essar Steel today inaugurated its fourth service centre in north India at Bahadurgarh. The unit, set up at a cost of Rs 75 crore, will produce 2.5-lakh-tonnes of steel per annum.

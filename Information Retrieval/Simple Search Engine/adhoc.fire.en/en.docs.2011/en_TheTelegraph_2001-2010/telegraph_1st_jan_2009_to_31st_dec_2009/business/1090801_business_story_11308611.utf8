                                                                                                               ABG offers more for Great Offshore 
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                            
	Mumbai, July 31: ABG Shipyard has raised its open offer price for Great Offshore to Rs 450 per share to counter a rival bid by Bharati Shipyard, whose offer price is Rs 405.        
	The two have been locked in a battle to gain control over the offshore oil services provider. The tussle began last month when ABG Shipyard  the countrys largest private ship builder  offered Rs 375 per share for a 32.12 per cent stake in Great Offshore, outbidding Bharati Shipyards bid of Rs 344 apiece.        
	Bharati Shipyard had placed its offer in early June for a 20 per cent stake.        
	Last month, Bharati Shipyard raised its holding to 19.47 per cent after picking up a 4.58 per cent stake through a block deal at Rs 403 per share. ABG then held around 2.02 per cent in Great Offshore.         
	However, of late, the latter has been further increasing its holding in Great Offshore.        
	On Thursday, it bought 2,12,348 shares of the target firm for Rs 450 per share on the NSE. These shares accounted for around 0.57 per cent of Great Offshore equity. This came after it bought a 5.18 per cent stake on Wednesday. Thus, the total holding of ABG stands at around 8 per cent.

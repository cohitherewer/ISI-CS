          OUR CORRESPONDENT                                    
	New Delhi, Aug. 2: Indian exporters are finding it difficult to make inroads into the European Union (EU), because of the regions protective policies in the face of recession, according to a survey. The EU is offering subsidy on domestic products and has imposed non-tariff barriers.         
	According to the survey by the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry, The post-recession experience of Indian exporters doing business with the EU reveals that they are facing the adverse impact of the huge amount of subsidies enjoyed by the EU farmers through free seeds and fertilisers and a freight subsidy to producers.         
	Exporters also have to go through cumbersome quality testing, which increases the cost. Many mid-sized pharmaceutical companies have been severely hit because of the recent seizure of shipments at transit ports.         
	The main impediments in the expansion of services to the EU are visa and consular issues, non-clarity of taxation and cross-border transaction laws as applicable to Indian service providers, the survey said. In the IT sector, companies face difficulties in obtaining work permits. Clients in the EU who sign time-bound contracts and expect timely delivery rarely appreciate delays.        
	Another major hurdle faced by IT firms with businesses in more than one EU country is that of movement of personnel between branches within Europe. The current rules require the procurement of a separate work permit each time, which involve elaborate bureaucratic procedures. The Ficci survey covered four broad aspects  perception of the EU as a trade partner, issues of concern, reaction to the proposed India-EU free trade agreement and future business plans between the two.        
	A majority of the respondents considered the EU as a very attractive market, owing to factors such as a strategic location, wide consumer base and common visa regime.         
	They also plan to expand trade in next two years either by way of exploring new markets within the EU and setting up distribution centres or entering into a tie-up with existing market players.        
	However, according to exporters, doing business with more than one EU country does not fetch them economies of scale because the standards are different for various countries.         
	Products complying with the UK standards and supplied from India to other EU countries such as Germany are not accepted whereas the same products supplied through the UK are accepted and vice versa.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Bank talks fail, strike on
                                                                                                               Bank talks fail, strike on
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Calcutta, Aug. 4: The United Forum of Bank Unions, an umbrella organisation of five workers and four officers unions, will go ahead with its two-day bank strike on August 6 and 7 after the meeting on wage negotiation with the Indian Banks Association failed today. Almost nine lakh bank employees in the country will not join work on those two days.         
	The forum had earlier called for a strike on June 12 following a disagreement with the IBA on its demand for a 20 per cent hike in wages that has been pending since November 2007. Besides wage revisions and compassionate appointments, the forum is demanding a provision for one more pension option.        
	The strike on June 12 was called off following a conciliatory meeting on June 9 where the IBA agreed to improve an earlier offer of a 15 per cent hike to 17.5 per cent, said Ashok Mukherjee of the State Bank Staff Association.        
	On June 17, the IBA said according to the governments advice, banks could not offer more than a 15 per cent hike. The forum met IBA chairman M.V. Nair on July 14 and protested IBAs volte face on the earlier offer, Mukherjee said.        
	During this deputation, the forum called for a two-day strike on August 6 and 7 if its demands were not met. It also demanded the immediate resumption of negotiations and a speedy settlement. The IBA expressed its inability because of the governments Stand. The Chief Labour Commission convened a conciliatory meeting with the forum and the IBA.         
	But today, the IBA further reduced its offer of a wage hike to 13 per cent. After this all talks failed, Mukherjee said.

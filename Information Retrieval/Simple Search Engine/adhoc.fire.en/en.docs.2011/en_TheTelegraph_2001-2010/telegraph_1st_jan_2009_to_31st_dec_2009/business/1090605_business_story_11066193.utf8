          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Mumbai, June 4: The State Bank of India and a clutch of public sector banks are bailing out cash-strapped Kingfisher Airlines with loans of Rs 2,000 crore.         
	Sources say the SBI, Bank of India, Bank of Baroda and Punjab National Bank are disbursing the loans against corporate guarantees and a personal guarantee extended by Kingfisher chairman Vijay Mallya.         
	Fund-raising is an ongoing process. Since we are bound by confidentiality and non-disclosure agreements, it will be inappropriate to offer a comment at this stage, said a UB group spokesperson.         
	Recently, UB Holdings  the parent company of Kingfisher Airlines  had sought approval from shareholders to authorise the board to give corporate guarantees of up to Rs 12,000 crore to the lenders of Kingfisher Airlines, by pledging shares and mortgaging movable and immovable properties.         
	SBIs share of the loans extended to Kingfisher Airlines is around Rs 900 crore, sources said. Like its peers, Kingfisher has been facing a cash crunch as the slowdown has led to mounting losses. In the third quarter of 2008-09, the airlines suffered a loss of Rs 413 crore. It has had trouble paying dues to oil companies and airports for a variety of services.

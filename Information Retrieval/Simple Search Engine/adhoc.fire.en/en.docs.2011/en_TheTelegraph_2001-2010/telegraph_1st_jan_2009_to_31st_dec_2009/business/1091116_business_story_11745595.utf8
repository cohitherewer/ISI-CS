	Mumbai, Nov. 15 (PTI): The proposed real estate bill, which is expected to be tabled before Parliament next month, will not include regulation of residential property prices, a top government official said.        
	We have decided not to include the regulation of prices. Our aim is to guard against fraudulent activities of certain developers and protect the interest of the end consumer, joint secretary (housing) S.K. Singh said.        
	The legislation will exclude the activities of the commercial real estate sector and brokers. We felt that the developers and their various bodies can regulate them (brokers) in their own way, Singh said.        
	The government has received suggestions from stakeholders such as the state governments and developers on the bill, he said. We have already received more than 400 responses and we will make changes in the proposed bill accordingly, he said.

	New Delhi, July 22: The board of loss-making Air India will be revamped within a month with the inclusion of seven independent directors, civil aviation minister Praful Patel said on Wednesday.         
	Air India will be restructured financially, organisationally and I am very sure it will start making profits soon and we will silence all the critics, Praful Patel said.         
	We will transform the management and involve a lot of important and eminent people on the board of Air India and have an international advisory board as is the practice across the world, Patel said.        
	The names doing the rounds include National Knowledge Commission chairman Sam Pitroda, Infosys chief mentor N.R. Narayana Murthy and TCS managing director S. Ramadorai. Official sources said the seven independent directors would be of international repute.        
	Air India will soon advertise globally for a chief operating officer. The COO will report to chairman Arvind Jadhav and help to beef up Air Indias day-to-day operations, sources said.        
	Patel said, The government will not interfere in Air Indias problems beyond a point. The management has to address the issues.         
	There has to be a change in the work culture of the airline. The government will be happy to help but we expect equal enthusiasm from Air India, Patel said.        
	The government has appointed SBI Capital to draw up a growth plan for the carrier.        
	Soon, we will be getting feedback on what would be the short, medium and long term restructuring required for Air India, Patel said.        
	Meanwhile in the Lok Sabha, BJPs Shatrughan Sinha has demanded a joint parliamentary committee probe into the working of the national carrier, which suffered losses worth Rs 5,000 crore last fiscal.

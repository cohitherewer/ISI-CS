The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Govt set to borrow more 
                                                                                                               Govt set to borrow more 
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Cash course                                  
	New Delhi, Feb. 10: The government will borrow an additional Rs 46,000 crore on top of its budgeted borrowing of Rs 1,00,571 crore, officials said today.         
	Top finance ministry officials today chalked out a plan with the RBI to float bonds and raise the money.        
	The government needs the cash to pay for a host of off-budget expenses, which include additional food and fertiliser subsidies, a farm loan waiver, pay hikes for civil servants and a stimulus package for industry.         
	We had discussions with the Reserve Bank. The borrowing of Rs 46,000 crore will be done between February 20 and March 20, economic affairs secretary Ashok Chawla said after the meeting. Chawla said the money would be borrowed in four tranches.         
	The bonds would sap up funds from the market and this could effectively raise the cost of borrowing for industry.         
	However, Montek Singh Ahluwalia, deputy chairman of the Planning Commission, said the borrowing wouldnt cause a cash squeeze.        
	Government bond yields climbed after the announcement. Yield on the most traded 8.24 per cent 2018 bond closed at 6.49 per cent, up nearly 17 basis points over the last close.        
	The bonds, which used to attract an yield or interest rate of 4 per cent in the beginning of this fiscal, now fetch 6.44 per cent. The fiscal deficit, which the borrowing will help to redress, is expected to top Rs 2,25,000 crore against a budgeted Rs 1,33,287 crore.

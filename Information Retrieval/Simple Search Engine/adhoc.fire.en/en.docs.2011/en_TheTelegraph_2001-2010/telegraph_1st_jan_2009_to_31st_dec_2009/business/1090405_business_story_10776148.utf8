                                                                                                               Panasonic to invest $300m
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                                            
	New Delhi, April 4: Panasonic India plans to invest $300 million in the country over the next three years. The company hopes to achieve a turnover of Rs 4,500 crore in 2009-10.        
	Panasonic, its Japanese parent, is consolidating operations in India by bringing all its existing group companies under one entity  Panasonic India  by the end of this fiscal.        
	We are looking at doubling the turnover for our group this fiscal. Panasonic Indias turnover for 2008-09 is expected to be around Rs 2,200 crore. As for our expansion plans, the company is looking at opening two facilities  and we are considering locations like Haryana and Chennai for this, said Sabiha Kidwai, general manager-marketing (consumer products), Panasonic India.        
	Panasonic is a relatively small player and is operating on a low base in the country. It is, therefore, looking at a near 100 per cent growth in its turnover for this financial year.        
	India contributes less than 1 per cent to the companys global turnover of Rs 4,50,000 crore. The target is to contribute nearly 5 per cent in the coming five years.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Honda threatens to close Manesar unit
                                                                                                               Honda threatens to close Manesar unit
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Oct. 10: Japanese two-wheeler maker Honda Motorcycle and Scooter India (HMSI) has threatened to shut down its factory at Manesar in Haryana and move to an alternative location after labour unrest crippled operations for over two months.        
	However, the workers union of HMSI has denied being on any strike. At present, HMSI has 1,872 workers who are part of the union; another 2,500 are on contract.        
	Our production has come down to 50 per cent in the last two months because of the strike. Its not viable to run a company like this and therefore it has become important for us to bring about some radical changes. So we may look out for an alternative location, said N.K. Rattan, head (sales and marketing) of HMSI, told The Telegraph.        
	The workers are protesting against the new wage settlement deal after the previous three-year agreement expired on July 31 this year.        
	According to Mohan Deepak, vice-president (industrial relations) of HMSI, the average cost-to-company (CTC) for a shop-floor worker is now around Rs 25,000. The labour union is demanding a higher fixed and variable salary, apart from better incentives. If this is accepted, the CTC of the workers will be higher than the shop-floor employees. This demand is not acceptable to us. We are ready to pay a reasonable salary depending on the age and experience of our associates with reasonable hikes to improve their quality of life, said Deepak.        
	Production has come down to 2,000 units a day from an average of 4,200 units till July because of the unrest. Sources say the company has suffered a loss of about Rs 250 crore.        
	The labour union has also stopped production on the third line, which would have taken our capacity to 5,000 units a day. Around 100 workers have stayed away from installing a third production line under the instructions of the union and also threatened engineers and managers who tried to carry out the work, said Rattan.        
	The company has approached the Punjab and Haryana high courts to prevent the workers union from disrupting production and prosecute those who have violated law. The matter will come up for hearing next week.        
	Ashok Yadav, president of HMSIs employees union, however, denied that the workers were on strike and said the decline in production was because of non-availability of components as some supplying factories were on strike. The ongoing labour strike in Rico, Sunbeam and some other ancillary companies have led to a drop in component supplies, said Yadav.

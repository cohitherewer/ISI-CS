The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Sebi noise in Bharti-MTN line   Takeover rule tweak to impact mega deal
                                                                                                               Sebi noise in Bharti-MTN line
   Takeover rule tweak to impact mega deal          VIVEK NAIR AMP; JAYATI GHOSE                                                  
	Sept. 22: A sudden and tectonic change in the takeover regulations today threatened to scupper the $23-billion Bharti-MTN deal to create a telecom behemoth that has been under negotiation for close to four months.        
	Sebi tweaked the takeover rules when it ruled that open offer rules would be triggered when holders of American depositary receipts (ADRs) and global depositary receipts (GDRs) with voting rights crossed a 15 per cent threshold.        
	Under the takeover rules, anyone acquiring voting rights of over 15 per cent in a company has to come out with an open offer to minority shareholders to buy another 20 per cent at the same price.        
	Until now, ADRs and GDRs were outside its ambit as they do not confer direct voting rights to its holders.         
	However, these instruments can be converted into shares at a later date at the option of the holder. Companies must deposit shares equivalent to the conversion value of the ADRs/GDRs with a global depositary. The depositaries can, however, vote on these shares  and often do so under instruction from the ADR/GDR holders.        
	The change in the takeover rule was taken at a meeting of the Sebi board today. Sebi chairman C.B. Bhave told reporters later that the amendment would not have retrospective effect.        
	The Bharti-MTN alliance could be the first casualty of the rule change, which came just a week before the two telecom giants were due to unveil the terms of their grand alliance.        
	Bharti confident        
	Bharti was confident that the rule tweak would not jeopardise its talks with MTN. The company said it would seek an exemption from the open offer from Sebi, if required, at an appropriate time.         
	We can confirm that the structure (of the alliance between the two telecom firms)  will be fully compliant with the laws in both the countries. All relevant approvals, including exemption from the open offer from Sebi (if required) would be sought at the appropriate time, it said.        
	The MTN spokesperson refused to comment on the latest development.        
	Meanwhile, Bharti group chairman Sunil Mittal met Prime Minister Manmohan Singh to explain the contours of the proposed merger and, perhaps, to seek his help in clearing regulatory hurdles. Mittal is believed to be seeking Singhs help in interceding at the highest level in South Africa. Singh is expected to meet South African President Jacob Zuma during the G20 talks over the weekend.         
	On Thursday, representatives from the finance ministry, Sebi and the Reserve Bank of India are due to meet with South African officials in Mumbai to discuss issues surrounding the terms of the alliance and the fallout of this rule change.        
	Deal structure         
	Under the deal structure, MTN of South Africa is scheduled to acquire a 25 per cent economic interest in Bharti Airtel. In addition, a few key shareholders of MTN are due to take up another 11 per cent through the issue of ADRs or GDRs. In turn, Bharti Airtel is supposed to acquire a 49 per cent stake in MTN.         
	The original deal structure is believed to have gone through some changes to soothe resentment among the shareholders of the South African company. The details of the new deal structure were due to be announced before a September 30 deadline.        
	Mittal is understood to have made significant changes to the original deal proposed in May in order to skirt regulatory hurdles. An all-cash offer to minority holders of MTN, and more shares in Bharti for the same money are some changes being made to the structure, said sources.         
	Officials from Bharti Airtel and MTN had met Sebi officials to seek clarity on open offer regulations. In an informal guidance given on June 22, the market regulator had told the two sides that MTN would have to come out with an open offer only when it sought to convert the depositary rights into shares with voting rights.        
	Observers say that one option would be to issue ADRs or GDRs to MTN and its shareholders where they agree to suspend their voting rights on the underlying shares held with the depositary in exchange for more cash.        
	IDR relief         
	In its bid to make Indian Depository Receipts (IDRs) more attractive, Sebi today decided to extend the facility of anchor investors to such instruments. The market regulator also decided that at least 30 per cent of the issue size of IDRs be reserved for allocation to retail investors.

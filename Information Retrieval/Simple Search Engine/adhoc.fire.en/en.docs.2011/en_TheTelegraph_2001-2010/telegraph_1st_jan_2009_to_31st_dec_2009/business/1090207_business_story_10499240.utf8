          JAYANTA ROY CHOWDHURY AMP; R. SURYAMURTHY                      Growth booster                          
	New Delhi, Feb. 6: The Congress-led government will announce measures to create more jobs in its interim budget along with a stimulus package for exporters.         
	The government will spend more money on employment-intensive projects such as the rural job guarantee and housing for the poor schemes.         
	Around Rs 16,000 crore was earmarked for the job guarantee scheme in this fiscal. About a quarter of this, or Rs 4000-4,500 crore, is likely to be allotted for April and May, when the current government will be in power.         
	The scheme provides a legal guarantee of 100 days of employment in every financial year to the adult members of a rural household willing to do public work at a statutory minimum wage.        
	Officials said the scheme had provided 3.58 crore people employment and could be expected to create another 10 lakh jobs in the April-May period.         
	Two more schemes  housing for the urban poor and housing for the rural poor  will be allotted more funds.         
	Around 60 lakh houses for the poor in rural and urban areas have been planned for this fiscal.        
	In the April-May period, the target is about 6-8 lakh houses, creating 10 lakh more jobs.        
	The vote-on-account would also include duty cuts to help textile units and exporters who have been hit by the global recession.         
	Top finance ministry officials said that there was a convention that the government should not offer any tax proposals in a vote-on-account. However, the government cannot be barred from offering tax concessions to industry suffering from a slowdown.        
	Ashwani Kumar, minister of state for industry, said: A calibrated sector-specific policy prescription is in the process of being formulated. You will see some indications in the vote-on-account or even before the vote-on-account.        
	We are coming up with sector-specific packages to boost those areas which need to be kick-started, particularly those which are labour-intensive, he said. The government is also likely to co-ordinate with the RBI, which is expected to cut both the repo and reverse repo rates by about half a per cent.

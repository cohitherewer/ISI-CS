The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Toyota set to roll out own small car
                                                                                                               Toyota set to roll out own small car
          GARIMA SINGH NEOGY                          Sandip Singh: Big move                                  
	New Delhi, Oct. 22: Japanese car maker Toyota Kirloskar Motors is planning to launch its own small car in India by the end of next year.        
	The company will source 70 per cent of the components locally as it prepares to make India a hub for its small cars.        
	However, the Japanese giant denied plans to bring in a second small car from group company Daihatsu.        
	Our energies are now focussed on launching Toyotas small car in India on schedule. There are no plans for a joint collaboration with Daihatsu for the same. These are baseless rumours. We have not held any talks with them. We are not conducting any feasibility study on this issue as of now, Sandip Singh, deputy managing director (marketing) of Toyota Kirloskar Motors, told The Telegraph over phone from Tokyo.        
	The small car will be produced at the companys upcoming 100,000-unit-a-year plant at the outskirts of Bangalore.         
	Toyota, reportedly, has launched Daihatsu cars in some countries such as Indonesia and Malaysia. The cars, in the entry-level 600cc segment, are doing well.        
	Daihatsu is known in Japan for its mini cars and recently launched the 660cc Mira Cocoa for women. Its passenger car range includes models such as the Materia, Copen, Sirion and Curore, with engine capacities of up to 1.5 litres.         
	Daihatsu had wanted to foray into India, but talks with the late Manu Chhabria, among others, failed.        
	Toyota will launch both the diesel and petrol variants of the small car, powered by a 1.3 and a 1.2-litre engine, respectively. The small car, according to Singh, will generate volumes for Toyota and increase its market share. The company will later export the car to neighbouring countries.         
	We currently have a market share of 3 per cent but by 2015 it should reach 10 per cent. Our small car should contribute to this figure substantially, said Singh.

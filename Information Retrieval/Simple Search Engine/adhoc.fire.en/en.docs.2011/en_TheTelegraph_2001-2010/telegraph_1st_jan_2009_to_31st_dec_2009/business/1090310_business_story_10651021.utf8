The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | General Atlantic eager to join race
                                                                                                               General Atlantic eager to join race

	March 9: General Atlantic Partners (GAP) has emerged as one of the private equity investors that is likely to bid for a majority stake in Satyam.        
	Initially, it was thought that the Satyam board might try and keep non-IT players out of the bidding process.         
	However, there were no such stipulations in todays announcement, prompting investment bankers to speculate about GAPs intentions.         
	One of the reasons why investment bankers believe that GAP may be a likely contender is the firms track record in India. GAP has invested heavily in the information technology and outsourcing space. Some of its big investments are in Genpact, Patni Computer and Hexaware.         
	There is a possibility that GAP may tie up with Patni. Tech Mahindra had also initiated talks with private equity funds to mount a joint bid.        
	The names of several private equity players such as TPG, Carlyle, KKR and Blackstone have cropped up in the past. But it isnt clear whether any of them are interested.        
	IBM strategy        
	Speculation is also rife over global IT giant IBMs intentions.        
	When contacted, an IBM spokesperson said, IBM does not comment on rumours and speculation.        
	According to analysts, IBM, which has about $12 billion in cash, might be interested.        
	However, a lack of clarity on the extent of Satyams liabilities could deter IBM, or any other potential buyer.         
	If IBM acquires Satyam, it will become the largest IT services player in India with a combined employee strength of over 125,000.        
	The IT giant was named as one of the hostile bidders for Satyam by Ramalinga Raju at the ill-fated board meeting of December 16. Satyam had also named IBM as one of its key competitors in a filing to the New York Stock Exchange in February.         
	At the December board meeting, Raju had proposed the merger of Maytas Infra and Maytas Properties with Satyam, which ultimately led to his downfall.

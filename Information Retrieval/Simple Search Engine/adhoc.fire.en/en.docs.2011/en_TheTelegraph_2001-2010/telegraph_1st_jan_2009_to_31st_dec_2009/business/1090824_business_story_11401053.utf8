The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Govt bid to end Reliance-NTPC row
                                                                                                               Govt bid to end Reliance-NTPC row
          R. SURYAMURTHY                                            
	New Delhi, Aug. 23: The petroleum and power ministries are exploring the possibility of an out-of-court settlement of the tiff between Reliance Industries (RIL) and state-owned power firm NTPC over the price of gas from the formers fields in the Krishna-Godavari basin.        
	One of the option is to annul NTPCs 2004 global tender  the basis of the PSUs claim of gas from RIL at $2.34 per million British thermal unit (mBtu)  with a promise from the Mukesh Ambani company to supply gas at a higher price of $4.2 but without charging an additional marketing fee, which is applicable for other buyers.        
	Since NTPC, in this scenario, would pay more than $2.34, the government would compensate it by some kind of a subsidy to the extent of the profit petroleum. The $4.2-price has been fixed by the governments empowered group of ministers (eGoM).        
	Following the subsidy, NTPC will actually pay less than $4.2.        
	Another option is to give gas not from Reliances fields but from those whose price is fixed through the governments administered price mechanism, which is $1.98.         
	The system of administered prices started in 1999 and is for state-owned oil and gas producers. For private producers, the prices are determined by production sharing contracts.        
	Senior officials involved in the talks between NTPC and RIL said the discussions were at a preliminary stage, and the objective was to ensure the PSU did not suffer losses in the long run.         
	Any settlement would be based on a legal opinion, so that it would not be challenged in the courts at a later date, they said. However, none of the officials, or industry persons, were ready to be quoted; nor were they willing to confirm the move on record.         
	If the global tender was annulled, it would kill two birds at one stroke. The price quoted by RIL to supply gas to NTPC is the price being quoted by RNRL (Reliance Natural Resources Limited) in its case with RIL to seek gas. If that price (NTPC) itself does not exist, where is the question of that reference price in the other case, sources close to those involved in the discussion said.         
	NTPC and RIL are fighting a case in Bombay High Court over the price at which the latter will supply 12 million cubic metres per day (mcmd) of gas from its Krishna-Godavari fields to the formers Kawas and Gandhar facilities for 17 years.         
	NTPC claimed the two had agreed to a price of $2.34, the price quoted by the Mukesh Ambani firm in the 2004 tender. RIL wants to sell at $4.20 as NTPCs price has not been approved by the government.         
	Officials of the PSU are sceptical of the settlement moves as it will have to pay more if the gas supply intent contract  an outcome of the tender  is cancelled.         
	Sources said NTPC could lose over Rs 20,000-Rs 30,000 crore if a situation emerged where it was forced to pay $4.2 and did not get any subsidy.        
	The government has not received any proposal from RIL to approve the sale of gas to NTPC  so no decision has been taken by it on the matter. But for RNRL, the government has already rejected the (gas) price of $2.34.         
	In NTPC, too, the government may reject it because it is below the eGoM-determined $4.2 price.        
	Recently, NTPC has signed a deal with GAIL (India) Limited to buy 2 mcmd of LNG gas for 10 years at a delivered price of close to $8 per mBtu, much above the price at which it is demanding gas from Reliance.        
	The gas from Qatar will cost $6.4 per mBtu, excluding the cost of transportation, taxes and marketing margins. In addition to NTPC, Reliance is also engaged in a bitter legal battle with RNRL  promoted by Mukeshs younger brother Anil  over Krishna-Godavari gas.        
	RNRL, on the basis of an agreement between the two brothers during the demerger of the Reliance group four years ago, is also demanding gas at $2.34 for its proposed plant at Dadri in Uttar Pradesh, which has been rejected by the government.        
	A case between RIL and Reliance on the gas price will be heard next month before the Supreme Court.        
	On Friday, the government said it was not correct that it would earn Rs 500 crore from the KG basin gas, as claimed by Anil in the media. It said it would get Rs 84,000 crore.

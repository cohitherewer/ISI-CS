          GARIMA SINGH NEOGY                          Bold move                                  
	New Delhi, Nov. 26: Koutons Retail India will expand to the Gulf next year.        
	The decade-old clothes brand, which caters to the mass market, has an annual turnover of Rs 1,000 crore and plans to grow 30-40 per cent this fiscal.        
	We are looking to expand to the Gulf. Our target customers are there. Our plans are at the concept stage, but a final decision will be taken after March, Balvinder Singh Ahluwalia, president of Koutons Retail India, told The Telegraph on the sidelines of a summit here.        
	The ready-to-wear clothing range will, however, not make upmarket items. Singh said, We are a price-conscious, value-for-money brand and will like to remain so.        
	Koutons is present in 495 cities through 1,400 exclusive outlets, and eastern India contributes just 10 per cent to its total sales. We would like this to go up to at least 15 per cent next fiscal, said Ahluwalia.        
	Koutons plans to add 100 stores to take its retail strength to 1,500.         
	Around 90 per cent of the stores are franchisee outlets, while the rest are owned by the company. Koutons, which began with menswear, ventured into childrens and womens clothing last year, turning into a family brand.         
	Ahluwalia said, The company is going to consolidate its business. Wherever necessary, we will replace or upgrade outlets to make them family stores.         
	Our range is complete  from smart casuals to formals and party wears for the entire family, said Ahluwalia.         
	Charlie Outlaw, Les Femme, Koutons Junior, K2ONE and FeelMe are some of the other brands of the company.

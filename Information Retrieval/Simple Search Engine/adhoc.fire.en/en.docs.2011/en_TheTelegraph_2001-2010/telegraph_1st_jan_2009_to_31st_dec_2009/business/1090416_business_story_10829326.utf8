          OUR BUREAU AND AGENCIES                              
	New Delhi, April 15: Satyam today moved the Company Law Board for approval to induct four directors from top bidder Tech Mahindra on its board. It also sought more time to declare the financial results.        
	In addition, the company moved the CLB to issue 31 per cent fresh equity to Tech Mahindra to complete the takeover process.        
	The new directors, whom Satyam wants to join on its board, are senior employees of Tech Mahindra, including vice-chairman and managing director Vineet Nayyar, director Ulhas N. Yargop, international operations president C.P. Gurunani and strategic initiatives president Sanjay Kalra.        
	At present, Satyam has six government nominees on its board, including chairman Kiran Karnik.        
	The CLB is likely to give its decision on the Satyam case tomorrow, paving the way for the takeover of the company by Tech Mahindra.         
	Satyam in its affidavit before the CLB sought time to declare the financial results for the quarters ended December 2008 and March 2009 .        
	It further said that Tech Mahindra be treated as a bidder and the company allowed to issue additional shares while inducting Venturbay Consultant, a wholly owned subsidiary, as a strategic partner.        
	Tech Mahindra, promoted by the house of Mahindras, floated Venturbay Consultant as a special purpose vehicle to acquire Satyam.        
	However, the induction of the strategic partner will be subject to the winning bidder depositing Rs 1,756 crore in an escrow account, representing 31 per cent of the enhanced share capital of Satyam at the rate of Rs 58 per share.        
	The appointment of directors, the affidavit said, will also be subject to Venturbay Consultant fully funding the escrow account required for making open offers under the takeover code of Sebi.        
	Earlier, talking to reporters, corporate affairs minister Prem Chand Gupta exuded confidence that there would not be any delay in the constitution of the new board and the incoming management would retain the existing staff.         
	Modi to appeal        
	SpiceCorp chairman B.K. Modi, which pulled out of the Satyam bidding process, is planning to approach the CLB alleging lack of disclosures in the bidding exercise and violations of CLB directions in many ways. We are writing a letter to Justice S.P. Bharucha and a copy of the letter will go to the CLB as well, Modi said.

	Calcutta, Oct.24: Electrosteel Castings has reported a near 50 per cent rise in net profit despite a steep drop in sales.        
	The ductile iron pipe maker scored a net profit of Rs 63 crore compared with Rs 42.12 crore in the same period last year. Net sales were down 32.55 per cent to Rs 355.93 crore from Rs 527.66 crore in the year-ago period.         
	The company attributed lower sales to a drop in trading turnover and reduced sales of by-products such as pig iron and sponge iron.        
	The company expects to get all the approvals for raising funds by the first week of November. The board has approved the issue of equity shares worth Rs 100-150 crore, non convertible debentures of Rs 200 crore and warrants of Rs 200 crore as qualified institutional placement.        
	Graphite show        
	Graphite India has posted a 43.55 per cent rise in net profit at Rs 68.40 crore compared with Rs 47.65 crore in the corresponding quarter of the previous year.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Maruti to gain from deal
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Maruti to gain from deal
          OUR CORRESPONDENT AMP; PTI                          Bhargava: Home run                                  
	New Delhi, Dec. 9: German auto maker Volkswagen would end up with a 10.8 per cent indirect stake in Indias top car maker Maruti, in which Suzuki has a controlling 54.2 per cent holding.         
	The deal could see Volkswagen using Maruti to make small cars for the global market and source cheap spares.        
	Over the years, Maruti has emerged as the crown jewel for Suzuki. In the last fiscal, the Indian firm contributed to 14 per cent of Suzukis sales and as much as 48 per cent to the Japanese companys profits.        
	Maruti chairman R.C Bhargava said, They (Suzuki) confirmed the deal, but it is too early to speculate on its implications in India. The deal means Volkswagen and Suzuki see much value in the arrangement in terms of technology sharing. However, he added that Maruti might become an original equipment manufacturer and supplier of small cars to Volkswagen.        
	Given Volkswagens global reach, sourcing from Suzuki can mean a huge jump in Marutis earnings.         
	Volkswagen has looked at Suzuki obviously from the small car angle, Bhargava said. It is too early to speak about concrete projects and plans that Volkswagen and Suzuki might jointly take in India. Details will be worked out in the weeks and months to come, a Volkswagen official said.        
	The cross-border transaction, however, does not attract any provisions of the Indian regulatory laws, till now, as the deal is not being seen as the sale of Indian assets abroad.         
	However, if the provisions on cross-border mergers in Indias competition laws had come into place, the transaction would have required regulatory approvals.         
	Auto stocks surge        
	Maruti Suzuki today emerged as the biggest gainer on the Bombay Stock Exchange with a 3 per cent rise to Rs 1,608.95. The Suzuki stake sale gave a boost to the stocks of other auto companies as well.         
	Shares of Hero Honda rose 1.74 per cent to Rs 1,700.95 and Bajaj Auto was up 1.84 per cent at 1,670.70, while the 14-share BSE auto index was up 0.69 per cent.

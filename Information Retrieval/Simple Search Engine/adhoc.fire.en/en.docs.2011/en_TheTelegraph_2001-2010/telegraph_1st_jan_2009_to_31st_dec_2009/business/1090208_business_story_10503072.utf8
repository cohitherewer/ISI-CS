                                                                                                               Glaxo, Sanofi set sights on Piramal
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Merger pill                                  
	Mumbai, Feb. 7: Piramal Healthcare could be the next buyout target of multinational companies looking to expand in emerging markets such as India.        
	A report in the Wall Street Journal said British pharmaceutical giant GlaxoSmithKline Plc is in discussions to acquire the $718-million Piramal Healthcare for around $1.5 billion.        
	Quoting people familiar with the matter, it added that the talks were at an early stage and could still fall apart. Other drug firms, including Frances Sanofi-Aventis SA, are also believed to be interested in Piramal.        
	In recent times, multinational drug firms have shown considerable appetite for local entities.         
	Last year, Daiichi Sankyo bought Ranbaxy Laboratories in a 500-billion-yen deal. German company Fresenius Kabi had acquired a 73 per cent stake in Dabur Pharma, a major player in the anti-cancer segment, for around Rs 872 crore.        
	Piramal Healthcare, however, has denied reports of a potential sale. The company said such speculation was totally unfounded.        
	Piramal Healthcare continues to have a strong belief in the potential of its core businesses. Accordingly, we have invested in our sales force, built state-of-the-art facilities and continue to pursue acquisitions, a company statement said.         
	In the current fiscal, Piramal Healthcare has acquired select brands of Khandelwal Labs, Plasma Select, Minrad International and Rx Elite Holdings, it added.         
	Piramal Healthcare is currently ranked fourth in the Indian market with a diverse product portfolio across nine therapeutic areas.         
	The company is also among the largest custom manufacturing companies with assets in North America, Europe and Asia.         
	Some of the therapeutic categories in which it is present include disorders of the central nervous system, diabetes, dermatology, gastroenterology and critical care, among others.        
	The company has reported a lower net profit of Rs 59.87 crore for the quarter ended December 31, 2008 compared with Rs 72.76 crore in the same period last year. This came after Piramal Healthcare provided Rs 35.15 crore towards loss on net foreign currency outstandings.         
	Total operating income on a consolidated basis for the quarter was up 14.9 per cent to Rs 830 crore.

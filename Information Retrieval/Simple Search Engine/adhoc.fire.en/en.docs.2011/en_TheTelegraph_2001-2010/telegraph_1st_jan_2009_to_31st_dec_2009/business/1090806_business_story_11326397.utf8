The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Larsen wants to exit Satyam
                                                                                                               Larsen wants to exit Satyam
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                            
	Mumbai, Aug. 5: Larsen amp; Toubro (L amp;T) has sought market regulator Sebis approval to sell its 8.31 per cent stake in Mahindra Satyam.        
	L amp;T had built up a 12 per cent stake in Mahindra Satyam, earlier known as Satyam Computer Services, which was rattled by Indias biggest corporate fraud.        
	In April, L amp;T lost out in the race for Satyam, which was eventually bought by Tech Mahindra and renamed Mahindra Satyam.        
	Based on the expanded share capital after Satyams takeover, L amp;Ts stake in the Hyderabad-based company is now 8.31 per cent.        
	Under the conditions of sale, Satyam bidders were barred from selling their stakes acquired prior to the bid for six months as they were given access to the companys financial information that was not available to the public.        
	L amp;T will, therefore, have to hold its shares till October.         
	Data available with the stock exchanges show that as on June this year, L amp;T had 81,132,714 shares of Mahindra Satyam.         
	At the current market price, its holding is worth Rs 916 crore. The Mahindra Satyam share ended at Rs 112.95, higher by 5 per cent on the Bombay Stock Exchange today.        
	Sources from L amp;T confirmed that the company had written to the Securities and Exchange Board of India, seeking its permission for the stake sale.         
	According to the official, L amp;T feels its stake in Satyam can no longer be considered a strategic investment.         
	Moreover, the lock-in period was introduced for the bidders as they had access to Satyams financial information that was not public at that time.         
	L amp;T wants the lock-in period to be relaxed as the information, which was made available to the bidders, is public now.        
	L amp;T has been exiting some of its investments, particularly those that are not considered a strategic fit or do not come under its current business portfolio.        
	In June this year, it sold its entire 11.49 per cent stake in UltraTech Cement at an average price of Rs 725 per share for around Rs 1,037 crore.

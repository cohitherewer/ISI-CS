                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Number portability to take more time
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                          Network jam                                  
	New Delhi, Dec. 17: Mobile phone users keen to switch operators with their numbers intact will have to wait at least till May.        
	The system  mobile number portability  was to be up and running in the metros from next month, but technology and security concerns have forced the department of telecommunications (DoT) to extend the deadline for its implementation by three-four months.        
	State-run BSNL and MTNL have asked for more time to upgrade their networks, while the home ministry has raised a security alarm over portability service provider Telcordia, which has implemented the system in Pakistan.        
	Telcordia and Syniverse are the two firms chosen to implement number portability.         
	DoT officials today met mobile service providers and Syniverse and Telcordia.         
	All operators need to upgrade their networks and connect with the two number portability operators.        
	It has been decided to extend the deadline for the implementation of number portability till May 2010 as security concerns and technological transference need to be overcome, said officials present at the meeting today.         
	Subscribers will be charged a maximum Rs 19 for the service and the process will take four days, according to the telecom regulator.        
	The home ministry has asked the Foreign Investment Promotion Board to review its clearance to the US-based Telcordia.         
	Telcordia has implemented number portability in 14 countries, including Pakistan. That is a source of concern for the Indian government, said officials.        
	There could be some delay in the implementation because of the time taken in upgradation and customisation of existing networks by access service providers, Gurudas Kamat, minister of state for telecom, told the Rajya Sabha today.

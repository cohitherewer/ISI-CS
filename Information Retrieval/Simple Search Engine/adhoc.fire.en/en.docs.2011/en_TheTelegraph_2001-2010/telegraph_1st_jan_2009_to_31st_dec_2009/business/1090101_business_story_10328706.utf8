                                                                                                               Buzz on lower telecom tariff
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                          New ringtone                                  
	New Delhi, Dec. 31: The Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai) wants service providers to reduce interconnection call charges.         
	The regulator today issued a consultation paper on fees collected by telecom firms from other mobile operators  a move that could help reduce tariffs.        
	The interconnection charge is paid by one telecom operator to another for using the latters network for origination, termination or carrying a call.         
	For instance, if a Reliance Communications subscriber calls a Bharti Airtel customer, Reliance Communications will have to pay Bharti 30 paise per minute.        
	The charge comprises a significant portion of mobile tariffs.         
	Any reduction in it will benefit consumers.         
	Telecom minister A. Raja had earlier said a reduction in the charge along with greater competition could lead to tariffs falling to as low as 10 paise per minute for local calls and 25-35 paise per minute for national long-distance calls by 2010.         
	At present, mobile termination charges are 13-30 paise per minute; landline termination fees are 19-28 paise per minute and carriage charges, or roaming costs, are 16-72 paise per minute.         
	These were fixed in 2002-03 and have not been reviewed, while the cost of services has come down by more than 50 per cent.         
	The regulator will announce the changes in the user charge after it receives inputs from the industry.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Behuria in New Delhi on Friday. Picture by Rajesh Kumar                                  
	New Delhi, Jan. 30: Indian Oil Corporation (IOC) has posted a 41.5 per cent rise in net profit for the third quarter ended December 31, 2008 on the back of low crude prices and oil bonds issued by the government.        
	Net profit for the quarter stood at Rs 2,958.59 crore compared with Rs 2,090.69 crore during the same period in 2007-08.         
	However, the company suffered a net loss of Rs 3,673.41 crore during the first nine months of the current fiscal mainly because of second quarter losses.         
	During April-December of the previous fiscal, the company had a net profit of Rs 7,376.85 crore.        
	The fall in global crude prices and the oil bonds issued by the government have increased the third quarter profits, Sarthak Behuria, chairman and managing director of IOC, said.        
	The under-recovery from selling fuels below cost, according to the IOC chief, will be Rs 56,000 crore in this fiscal. It may change depending on the market for crude.         
	The company has got a discount from upstream oil and gas producers such as ONGC and GAIL of Rs 18,059 crore and oil bonds worth Rs 34,165 crore during the nine months ended December.         
	We expect about Rs 8,0009,000 crore of additional oil bonds, Behuria said.         
	He is upbeat about the fourth quarter performance. I expect positive and optimistic results in one quarter. However, it is difficult to say how the year will look like because we are uncertain about how much bonds well get and what will be the overall price.        
	L amp;T show        
	Larsen amp; Toubro (L amp;T) today beat street estimates by posting a 216 per cent rise in net profit at Rs 1,520.44 crore for the third quarter ended December 31, 2008, from Rs 481.79 crore a year ago. The performance is attributed to a gain of Rs 916.33 crore accruing from the sale of its ready-mix concrete business.         
	Excluding the one-time income, profits grew 25.38 per cent to Rs 604.11 crore. Analysts had expected the company to post around 20 per cent growth in net profit.         
	Net sales rose to Rs 8,593.96 crore from Rs 6,382.68 crore a year earlier.         
	The company was able to secure fresh orders amounting to Rs 14,620 crore during the quarter against Rs 13,019 crore a year ago, despite the slowdown.

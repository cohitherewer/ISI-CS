                                                                                                               Uttam local tips for Mittal
          SAMBIT SAHA                                         
	Calcutta, Sept. 6: ArcelorMittals experience with Uttam Galva will come in handy when the worlds largest steel maker builds its two massive plants in the country.         
	Sudhir Maheshwari, member of the group management board of ArcelorMittal said Uttam Galva would provide key knowledge about the domestic market.         
	You can say, it will be a good build-up to the day when we start our integrated facilities in Orissa and Jharkhand, he said.         
	Speaking to The Telegraph from London, Maheshwari  a key aide of ArcelorMittal chairman Lakshmi Niwas Mittal  said working with Uttam Galva would also make the steel giant a known entity among industry and trade before the two massive 12 million-tonne plants came up. It will give us insight into the market  an understanding of local buyers and their demands. It would help us plan our strategy with the two integrated plants, he said.         
	Maheshwari, however, said the new facilities would be built by Mittals wholly owned subsidiaries, and Uttam Galva would not be involved. We were keen to have a presence in India as it is a growing market. This transaction has provided an opportunity for that, he said.         
	The Luxembourg-based company plans to use the marketing and distribution network of Uttam Galva to sell its own products. As of now, the two companies will chalk out strategies for growth.        
	Uttam Galva makes galvanised and cold-rolled products that are consumed by the white goods and auto sector, and ArcelorMittal will assist it in technology.         
	Uttam Galvas sales stood at around a million tonnes last year.         
	As we join the board as a co-promoter of the company, various growth issues will be discussed, Maheshwari said.         
	He said ArcelorMittal did not look at any company other than Uttam Galva, and it would be wrong to assume that it would be the beginning of a series of acquisitions.         
	L.N. Mittal himself had talked about the lack of acquisition targets in the country. None of the top five integrated players was up for sale.         
	Secondary steel producer Uttam Galva had provided a rare opportunity to him.

          OUR BUREAU                          Trim act                                  
	Mumbai, April 11: The State Bank of India today cut lending rates for small and medium enterprises and announced measures to improve credit flow to the fund-starved sector.        
	The SBI has reduced lending rates for new SME loans up to Rs 5 lakh to 8 per cent and that for loans between Rs 5 lakh and Rs 25 lakh to 10 per cent, SBI chief general manager B.S. Bhasin said.        
	The idea is to help SMEs in the face of economic downturn. With todays rate reductions, the SBI is now offering cheaper loans, which would help them tackle the crisis, Bhasin said.        
	The SBI used to offer SME loans up to Rs 5 lakh for 8.5-10.5 per cent and loans of Rs 5-25 lakh for 9-11 per cent.        
	The rate reductions will be available for the next two years and will be applicable to working capital and term loans provided they are covered under the Credit Guarantee Fund Trust for Micro and Small Enterprises scheme.        
	After two years, the bank will review the rates according to the prevailing market conditions.        
	The SBI has also extended the SME Help and the SME Care schemes, under which it offers loans to SMEs at 8 per cent till September 30, 2009.         
	Loans under SME Help will now be available for a period of two years at 8 per cent. The SBI currently has 12 lakh SME customers.        
	The SBI has so far disbursed Rs 300 crore through its special schemes  SME Help and SME Care  out of which, nearly Rs 250 crore was disbursed under SME Care.        
	SMEs currently contribute 20 per cent to the banks total revenue and the performance is likely to improve in the period ahead with an expected revival after September.        
	The sector expects a recovery from the downturn post-September, which would have a positive impact on the banks SME business as well, Bhasin said.        
	The SBI has begun the restructuring process of 41,000 SME accounts.

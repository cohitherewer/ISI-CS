The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Inflation enters positive zone
                                                                                                               Inflation enters positive zone
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                            
	New Delhi, Sept. 17: Rising food prices yanked inflation into positive territory for the first time in three months to 0.12 per cent for the week ended September 5.         
	The government, too, swung into action today, with the Union cabinet asking states to regulate the stocks of sugar, rice and pulses till September next year to prevent hoarding.         
	It is not unexpected. There could be some inflationary pressure in the economy in the months ahead, finance minister Pranab Mukherjee said.         
	Within the wholesale price index, which rose 0.12 per cent, the index for food articles increased 15.4 per cent, annually, up from the previous weeks 14.8 per cent because of poor rain. Inflation had been on the rise throughout most of last year because of a global surge in food and metal prices, touching a peak of 12.63 per cent for the week ended August 9, 2008.         
	With recession, however, inflation started falling subsequently and in the first week of June, it turned negative on the back of the softening of the prices of metals and manufactures and the base effect of high prices last year.         
	Prices of food items, however, continued to rise, with the expectation of shortages because of a delayed monsoon being a major factor. To curb the price rise, the government has ordered state-run agencies to import lentils, sugar and edible oil. Foodgrains may be also imported, officials said.         
	The pace of increase in prices is gathering momentum. In the coming weeks, it is continuously going to inch upwards and by March-end, it will definitely cross 6 per cent, D.K. Joshi, principal economist with rating agency Crisil, said.

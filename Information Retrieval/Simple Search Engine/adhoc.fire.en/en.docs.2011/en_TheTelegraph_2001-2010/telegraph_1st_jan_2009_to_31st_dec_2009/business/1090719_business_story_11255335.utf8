          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                    
	Calcutta, July 18: Allahabad Bank plans to venture into the mutual fund business.         
	On new business plans, there are a few things under our consideration, but these are all at the drawing board level, said chairman K.R. Kamath.        
	However, executive director J.P. Dua said the board was considering a few non-banking business opportunities, including asset management. But these are all at the proposal stage as of now, he added declining to divulge further details.         
	Allahabad Bank is already offering non-life insurance products in joint venture with Sompo of Japan.         
	The public sector bank today announced a 224.40 per cent increase in net profit at Rs 303 crore in the April-June quarter of the current financial year against Rs 93 crore in the same quarter last year.         
	While the spurt in net profit came on the back of a 156.59 per cent growth in other income, particularly from investment trading profit, the bank showed improved performance in core banking business.         
	Our net interest income grew 34.27 per cent to Rs 629.06 crore and net interest margin increased to 3 per cent from 2.88 per cent as at the end of March 2009, Kamath said.        
	Allahabad Banks net interest margin has improved because it has been able to bring down the cost of deposits to 6.08 per cent from 6.62 per cent at the end of March and simultaneously maintain the yield on advances at 10.86 per cent (10.88 per cent at the end of the last financial year).        
	The bank has also been able to reduce its non-performing assets (NPAs). Net NPA at the end of June stood at 0.37 per cent of net advances compared with 0.72 per cent at the end of March. Gross NPA, however, declined a to 1.79 per cent from 1.81 per cent.

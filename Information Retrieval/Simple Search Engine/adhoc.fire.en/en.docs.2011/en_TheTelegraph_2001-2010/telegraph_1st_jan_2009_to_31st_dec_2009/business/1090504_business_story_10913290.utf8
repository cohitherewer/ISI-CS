          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT      
	Mumbai, May 3: India is pushing for a greater say within the International Monetary Fund (IMF)  and clearly intends to use its recent offer to invest up to $10 billion in bonds due to be floated by the Fund as a subtle bargaining chip.         
	The IMF will float bonds for the first time as it beefs up its efforts to raise money to combat the global economic slump.         
	However, the mandarins at Delhis Raisina Hill and Mint Street in Mumbai are already seizing on this opportunity to use this investment as a tool to force open the door and press for a greater say in decision-making at the Fund along with countries such as China, Brazil and Russia.              
	The BRIC nations  the acronym formed from the first letter of the four countries  are among those with the largest foreign exchange reserves in the world.        
	The $10-billion investment in IMF bonds works out to less than 4 per cent of Indias total forex reserves of $252.46 billion as on April 17.        
	But it doesnt stop there. Reserve Bank governor Duvvuri Subbarao made Indias intentions very clear at last weeks Fund-Bank meeting in Washington, We call for the introduction of an open merit-based process, irrespective of nationality and geographical preferences, for the selection of the senior management of the Fund. The next managing director of the IMF should be selected in this manner.        
	Subbarao was addressing the meeting in the place of P. Chidambaram who is a member of the Funds International Monetary and Financial Committee.        
	This is the first time that India is pressing for what promises to be a tectonic change at the IMF  one of the two global financial institutions, along with the World Bank, that were formed at Bretton Woods in July 1944, a year before the Second World War ended. It established the ground rules for a global monetary order.        
	By convention, a US national heads the World Bank, while a European is nominated to the top job at the IMF.        
	Indias demand that the managing director at the IMF  the top post at the Fund  should also be subject to a merit-based selection process that is not confined to any geography could set the cat among the pigeons. It will almost certainly face vigorous resistance from the Europeans if and when the proposal is put to a test.        
	Based on the current voting rights, the proposal will be tossed out very easily. But the economic crisis has given countries such as India and China the opportunity to push for change by trying to wangle more votes.        
	The number of votes that a country is entitled to is crucially linked to the allocation of special drawing rights (SDRs)  a monetary instrument that draws its value from an IMF basket of currencies that comprise the euro, the Japanese yen, the British pound and the US dollar.         
	At present, the yen has the top weight in the basket that is recalibrated at frequent intervals.        
	India has an SDR allocation of 4158.2 million SDRs, which translates into a voting right of 1.89 per cent  which places it between Switzerlands 1.57 per cent and Belgiums 2.09 per cent.        
	Subbarao set the agenda for change by setting short-term and medium-term goals. The first task is to ensure that the April 2008 package of quota and voice reform is ratified at the earliest, he told the delegates at the meeting.        
	But more importantly, the Reserve Bank governor wants the Fund to advance the deadline for the completion of the 14th general review of quotas from January 2013 to January 2011.        
	The worldwide recession may drag on till 2011 but most agree it will blow over by 2013. By insisting that the Fund advance the deadline by two years, India is clearly pushing for a greater say in dealing with the economic crisis at a time when it has robust foreign exchange reserves.        
	The bond issue        
	Meanwhile, the pundits reckon that the IMF bond could emerge as a strong competitor to the 10-year US treasury bond which has a current yield of around 3 per cent.        
	Although India doesnt invest in US treasuries, China is a big investor in the US bonds. Yields on the US treasury bond have fallen since the market meltdown began in September with the collapse of Lehman Brothers. During the past 52 weeks, the 10-year US treasury has traded in a range of 2.03 to 4.32 per cent.        
	The IMF bond is likely to be linked to the SDR interest rate, which is currently pegged at 0.42 per cent. Brazil has insisted that the IMF bond must provide a yield that is higher than the US treasury if it wants takers. India hasnt quibbled about the rate on the IMF bond  at least not yet.         
	If the IMF doesnt nudge up the rate, it might find countries such as India are the only ones that might be prepared to park their money in the bonds in exchange for a greater say at the Fund.

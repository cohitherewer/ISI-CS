The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Cairn oil for private refiners
                                                                                                               Cairn oil for private refiners
          R. SURYAMURTHY                              
	New Delhi, Oct.14: Private refiners Reliance Industries and Essar Oil may soon be able to buy crude from Cairn Indias Rajasthan oilfields as state-owned entities are not keen on taking more than their quota.        
	Officials in the petroleum ministry said the three nominated PSUs  Indian Oil Corporation, Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Ltd and Mangalore Refinery and Petrochemicals Ltd  was not keen on picking up extra amounts as Cairns heavy and waxy crude was incompatible with their refinery configurations.        
	The government is now exploring the possibility of private refinery companies buying crude from Cairns Barmer fields.        
	The oil ministry is planning to nominate private refiners to buy Cairns Barmer crude rather than allow marketing freedom to the contractor.        
	India imported crude oil worth $75.7 billion during 2008-09 compared with $67.8 billion during 2007-08.         
	Reliance Industries has sought oil ministrys approval for 30,000-60,000bpd (barrels per day) of Cairn crude for each of its two refineries at Jamnagar.        
	Essar Oil has sought 30,000bpd this year and 120,000bpd by 2011 when it expands its Vadinar refinery in Gujarat.        
	The Barmer field started production in late August. Output will touch 30,000bpd by the end of the third quarter of this fiscal year and reach a plateau of 175,000bpd in 2011.        
	Crude from Cairns field is expected to cut the oil import bill by around 7 per cent at a peak production level of 175,000 bpd in 2011.

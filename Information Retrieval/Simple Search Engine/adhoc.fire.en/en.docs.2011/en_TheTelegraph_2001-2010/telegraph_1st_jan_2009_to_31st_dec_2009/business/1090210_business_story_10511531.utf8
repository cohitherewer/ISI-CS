                                                                                                               PE deals hit a rough patch
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Calcutta, Feb. 9: Private equity firms in the country are sitting on an investible corpus of $9-10 billion.         
	Deal making in private equity space has slowed down quite a bit in the last year and particularly in the last quarter, said Gopal Srinivasan, chairman, TVS Capital. There are more than 300 funds in the country.        
	Fund managers have become more cautious and conservative now following which the closure of deals is taking longer time. This is reflected in the lower number of completed deals, he said.        
	The number of private equity deals fell in 2008 at a time when valuations became more attractive because of the stock market meltdown.        
	According to Grant Thornton India, the value of deals was $10.59 billion against $19.03 billion in 2007. The average value declined to $33.93 million from $46.99 million in 2007.         
	TVS Capital manages $150 million of Shriram Growth Fund. We raised the money by the middle of last year but have so far invested Rs 20 crore in media and technology firms. Negotiations for investment of another Rs 100 crore are on with firms in retail, Srinivasan said.While transactions have slowed down, the quality of the deals has improved, according to George Thomas, fund manager at India Value Fund Advisors. It is an interesting time for deal making with many good opportunities now coming up, he said.

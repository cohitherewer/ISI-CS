          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Fresh start                                  
	Hyderabad, June 21: Satyam Computer Services has been renamed Mahindra Satyam, two months after being taken over by Bangalore-based Tech Mahindra.         
	The decision to change the brand identity and logo was taken at a board meeting here today.         
	The new robust brand is envisaged to represent the core values of the Mahindra group and the inherent strength of the Satyam brand, a press release quoted Anand Mahindra, vice-chairman and managing director of the Mahindra group, as saying.        
	The Mahindra Satyam brand will be based on values such as good corporate citizenship, professionalism, customer priority, quality focus and dignity of the individual, a company statement said.        
	A new logo of the company will be released within a week.         
	Vineet Nayyar, executive vice-chairman of the Satyam board said, The new management will adopt and inculcate the core values of the Mahindra group and assimilate them with the innate skills and capabilities of Satyam.         
	Meanwhile, the investigations by the enforcement directorate into the Satyam scam began on Saturday at the Chanchalaguda prison where some former senior officials of the company, including Ramalinga Raju, are in custody .         
	In April, Tech Mahindra had outbid others to acquire a majority stake in Satyam, following which Venturbay, the acquisition vehicle of the company, had deposited Rs 1,756 crore in an escrow account as a subscription amount for the initial shares.        
	Tech Mahindra has made an open offer to acquire an additional 20 per cent, at a minimum price of Rs 58 per share, which started on June 12.        
	Satyam on Friday said it had called back around 400 employees who were asked to sit on the virtual bench.         
	According to sources, nearly 380 employees, who were on the virtual pool, were asked to rejoin. Tech Mahindra had identified and put 8,000-10,000 surplus employees of the IT firm under a programme wherein an employee was paid part of the salary and retained on job.        
	Maytas project        
	Andhra Pradesh chief minister Y.S. Rajasekhar Reddy has directed officials to begin the re-bidding process for the Rs 12,500-crore Hyderabad metro rail project within a week if Maytas Infra fails to complete financial closure.

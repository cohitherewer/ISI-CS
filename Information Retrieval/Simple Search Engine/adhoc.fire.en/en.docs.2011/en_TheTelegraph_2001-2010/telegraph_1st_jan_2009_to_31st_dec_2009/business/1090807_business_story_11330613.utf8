The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Number portability by end of August
                                                                                                               Number portability by end of August
                            
	New Delhi, Aug. 6 (PTI): The guidelines for mobile number portability (MNP) would be finalised by August end and the telecom regulator today asked operators to keep their networks ready to roll out the service quickly.        
	We will have an open-house on porting charges on August 11. Within two to three weeks after that we will issue the final guidelines on mobile number portability, R.N. Prabhakar, who is a member of the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai), said.        
	The technology providers and operators should be ready with their networks so that the service could be launched once the guidelines are announced, Prabhakar added.        
	Last month, telecom secretary Siddhartha Behura had said the MNP would be implemented by the year end. The MNP service allows subscribers to switch to another service provider or from one technology to another while retaining their numbers.        
	The department of telecommunications (DoT) had issued guidelines for implementing the MNP in August last year.         
	The DoT had selected two US companies  Syniverse and Telcordia  as technology providers to implement the MNP.         
	Subscriber growth        
	Telecom operators in the country added around 1.2 crore subscribers in the wireless segment in June, taking the user base to 46.48 crore.        
	The total number of subscribers was 45.29 crore in May this year. The wireless segment added 12.03 million new subscribers in June, while the wireline segment witnessed a dip of 120,000 connections, Trai said.

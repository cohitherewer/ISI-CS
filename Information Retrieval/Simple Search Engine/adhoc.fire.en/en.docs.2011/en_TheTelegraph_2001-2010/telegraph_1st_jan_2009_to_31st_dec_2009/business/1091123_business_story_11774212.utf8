        Are Ulips the best bet after new norms made them cheaper, asks Srikumar Bondyopadhyay                                             
	If the carrot didnt work, the stick might. Life insurance companies had been making money hand over fist by selling unit-linked insurance plans (Ulips) as investment-cum-insurance products. But they were forced to reduce the charges on policies launched after October 2009 to comply with the new norms introduced by the insurance regulator.        
	From December, insurers will also have to modify the existing Ulips, launched before October, in compliance with the changed guidelines.        
	The Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority (IRDA) has put a cap on Ulip charges. But a life insurance plan is a contract between the insured person and the insurer. Hence, the benefit of the lower charges will accrue only to customers who are buying Ulips after October or December, depending on whether the plan was launched before or after October.         
	Following the changed norms, Ulips have certainly become cheaper. However, a combination of mutual funds and a term assurance plan can still score over a Ulip.        
	But before we examine this, let us see how insurers demanded excess charges from policyholders till the new norms came into force.         
	Charge counter        
	Let us compare the charges on Ulips launched by HDFC Standard Life recently and the insurers similar existing plans.        
	Under its new Super series, HDFC Standard Life has launched a childrens plan (Youngstar Super) and a pension plan (Pension Super).         
	For comparison, we have considered HDFC Standards existing children plan Unit-linked Youngstar II and Unit-linked Pension II.        
	The chart shows that policyholders who bought Ulips under the new Super series pay significantly lower charges compared with those who had bought HDFC Standard Lifes earlier Ulips.        
	In fact, the Super series are favourably compared with mutual funds in terms of charges. The fund management charges of these Ulips are much lower than mutual funds in which the expense ratio is around 2.25 per cent after market regulator Sebi banned fund houses from charging entry loads.         
	The Ulips also provide a guaranteed return of 50 per cent of the original annual premium (that is 5 per cent of the total premium paid over 10 years). So, the insurer is actually giving back the premium allocation charges it had deducted during the policy term.         
	Thus, the Super series with effectively no entry load (read, premium allocation charge) wins over equity mutual funds hands down.        
	Another Ulip launched by Aegon Religare Life Insurance Company, called Invest Maximiser plan, also scores over equity mutual funds in terms of costs.         
	The Invest Maximiser plan has a very low premium allocation charge  1.1 per cent of the total premium paid for a policy term of 10 years. The fund management charge of equity fund option of the plan is 1.25 per cent.         
	The policy administration charges in Invest Maximiser is also lower than HDFC Standard Lifes Super series.         
	However, not all Ulips launched in compliance with IRDAs new regulation are attractive compared with a combo product of equity mutual fund and term assurance.         
	For example, ING Vysya Lifes Flexi Life plan has a lower fund management charge of 1.25 per cent for the equity option, but its premium allocation charge is higher. Besides, the plan has a minimum first year premium of Rs 48,000.        
	Flexible terms        
	An interesting aspect of almost all the unit-linked plans launched after October is that policyholders can increase or decrease the premium from the second year without reducing the life cover.         
	This is so because private life insurers have witnessed a great reduction in policy retention, particularly in the pension plan segment, following the financial meltdown. So, they have brought in flexibility in the annual premium payment so that people can pay a lower premium when the going gets tough but can continue with the policy without it getting lapsed.        
	However, it will be interesting to note how insurers restructure their charges in unit-linked plans launched after the meltdown in the equity markets by offering guaranteed returns in various forms, such as the highest NAV in the first seven years and so on.         
	ICICI Prudential Lifes latest launch, LifeTime Maxima, comes with a lower premium allocation charge of 1.35 per cent of the total premium paid during a policy term of 10 years.         
	However, the plan offers investment allocation of 102 per cent of the annual premium paid from the sixth year.        
	It means that for a policy term of 10 years, the policyholder gets back 10 per cent of the annual premium paid. Hence, the policyholders total cost towards premium allocation charge is only 0.35 per cent.         
	However, the plan charges a very high policy administration fee  0.9 per cent of the annual premium charged on a monthly basis, that is, 10.8 per cent per annum! But again, the high policy administration charges are because of guarantees provided under the plan.         
	After the new norms on Ulip charges become effective, some may seem to be a better option over the mutual fund-term assurance combo while many others may still not be a good choice.

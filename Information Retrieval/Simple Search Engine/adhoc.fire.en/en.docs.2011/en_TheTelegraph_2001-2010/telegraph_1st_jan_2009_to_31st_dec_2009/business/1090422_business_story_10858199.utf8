          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Bringing joy                                  
	Mumbai, April 21: Companies looking to borrow overseas have reason to cheer as the Reserve Bank of India has extended the relaxation of the all-in-cost ceilings applicable to external commercial borrowings (ECBs) till December 31.        
	The central bank also eased rules for the buyback of foreign currency convertible bonds (FCCBs).        
	Currently, the all-in-cost ceilings for ECBs are 300 basis points above the London Inter Bank Offered Rate (Libor) for borrowings with an average maturity period of three years and up to five years.         
	The ceiling for loans above five years is Libor plus 500 basis points.        
	These ceilings were supposed to be in place till June 30, 2009 subject to the condition that ECB proposals above the prescribed ceilings, irrespective of the amount of the borrowing, would come under the approval route.        
	The RBI today said that considering the continuing tightness of credit spreads in the international markets, the relaxation in all-in-cost ceilings has been extended till December 31.        
	The policy for the premature buyback of FCCBs was relaxed in December.         
	Under the approval route, the central bank permits Indian companies to buy back FCCBs up to $50 million redemption value per company, subject to a minimum discount of 25 per cent on the book value. The payment has to come from internal accruals.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT      
	Mumbai, July 16: Larsen amp; Toubro Ltd, the engineering and construction company, today reported a 218 per cent rise in net profit for the first quarter ended June 30, 2009.        
	Buoyed by a stake sale in UltraTech Cement, L amp;Ts net profit jumped to Rs 1,598 crore during the quarter from Rs 502 crore in the corresponding period last year.        
	L amp;T recorded an extraordinary gain of Rs 1,020 crore from the sale of its entire stake in UltraTech, an AV Birla group company.                  
	Gross sales revenues were at Rs 7,430.85 crore compared with Rs 6,992.76 crore.         
	In the first quarter of 2008-09, L amp;T had reported sales of Rs 269 crore from the ready mix concrete (RMC) business, which was divested in the second half of 2008-09.         
	Excluding revenues from the RMC business, sales growth for the quarter ended June 30 stood at 11 per cent.        
	L amp;Ts order book shrunk 22 per cent to Rs 9,571 crore from Rs 12,234 crore in the year-ago quarter because of a cautious approach among companies         
	R. Shankar Raman, executive vice-president (finance) of L amp;T, said the company was confident of notching up a 25 per cent growth in orders during the current year.         
	Though the current quarter may look subdued, increased inflows in the third and fourth quarters will help to achieve this target, Raman said.        
	The engineering and construction segment reported a lower order inflow of Rs 8,373 crore, while revenue from electrical and electronics at Rs 576 crore was around last years level.         
	Poor demand from the recession-hit manufacturing and industrial sectors led to a lower revenue of Rs 437 crore for the the machinery and industrial products segment.

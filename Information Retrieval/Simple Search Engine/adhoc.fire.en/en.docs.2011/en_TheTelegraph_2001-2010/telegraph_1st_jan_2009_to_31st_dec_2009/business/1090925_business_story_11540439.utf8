	Calcutta, Sept. 24: Andrew Yule has objected to power generator DPSC Ltds 500 mega watt expansion plan on ethical grounds.        
	The company has expressed its reservations in letters to the heavy industries ministry, the LIC and the United India Insurance (UIC).        
	Yule holds 15.20 per cent in DPSC, while the LIC and the UIC hold 30.61 and 11.36 per cent, respectively. The combined holding of the three is up for sale.        
	Kallol Datta, chairman and managing director of Yule, said there would be a conflict of interest if DPSC moved ahead with expansion.         
	Descon, which is the largest shareholder in DPSC with a 32.32 per cent stake, is one of the bidders of DPSC in a sale process initiated by Yule.        
	Both Descon and DPSC have S. Radhakrishnan as their managing director.         
	It could be possible that Descon would be privy to some information that other bidders are not. Since the due diligence has already been completed by the bidders, it would be an unfair advantage to Descon, Datta said.

                                                                                                               SBI to merge Indore sibling by December
          JAYATI GHOSE                          Meeting point                                  
	New Delhi, Oct. 8: The merger of the State Bank of Indore with the State Bank of India (SBI) is likely to be completed by December.        
	The merger of the SBIs smallest associate  the State Bank of Indore  with itself has got all the approvals and will be completed by December-end, SBI officials said.        
	Boards of both the banks had approved the merger in June. The acquisition will help the SBI add 470 branches to its existing network of 11,448, officials said.         
	Post-merger, total assets of the countrys top lender will move close to the Rs 10-lakh-crore-mark. The SBI holds 98.3 per cent in the State Bank of Indore, which posted a net profit of Rs 279 crore in 2008-09. Total business stood at Rs 49,432 crore with a capital adequacy of 13.4 per cent at the end of March.         
	The SBI needs to increase the size of its operations as the country gears up to open its banking sector to foreign entities in a bigger way.        
	The finance ministry feels government-run banks should look for mergers and acquisitions in the next 5-10 years to achieve optimum economies of scale.        
	In early 2007, the SBI had announced its intention to merge its seven associate banks with itself. The merger would have taken the total assets of the bank to Rs 8,00,000 crore. However, that is not on the cards now.         
	Last week, the SBI had forayed into international market to raise close to $1 billion. The bond issue is part of the banks medium-term note programme. The proceeds of the issue will be used to fuel growth. SBI chairman .P. Bhatt had recently said his bank hoped to record a credit growth of 20 per cent in 2009-10.

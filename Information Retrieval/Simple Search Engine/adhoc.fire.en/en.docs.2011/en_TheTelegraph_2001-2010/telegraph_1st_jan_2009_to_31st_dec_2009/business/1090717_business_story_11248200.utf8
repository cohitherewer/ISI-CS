	Calcutta, July16: ICI India will set up a paints factory either in Karnataka or in Andhra Pradesh to service the southern market better.        
	After the divestment of its adhesive business unit last fiscal, ICI is now focusing on paints.        
	Amit Jain, ICIs newly appointed managing director, said the company would invest around Rs 200 crore in the new unit. The project detail would be finalised by the end of the current fiscal.        
	He said ICI would spend more on promoting its Dulux brand in the current year to beat the recession in housing and construction.        
	The Rs 1,000-crore ICI, which was originally a multi-product chemical giant, held its 55th annual general meeting here today. Over the years, the company has divested its catalyst, explosives, rubber chemicals and adhesive businesses.        
	Jain said ICI would focus on environment-friendly paints. The company plans to introduce lead and chrome-free decorative and protective paints soon. It is also working on pilot design studios where a customer will be able to choose the paints in various combinations.        
	ICI chairman Aditya Narayan said the economic slowdown, fluctuating crude prices and high dollar values had affected the companys cost structure. The company imports around 30 per cent of its raw material needs and any appreciation in the dollar and crude price pushes up costs.        
	Narayan estimated that an increase of $10 in crude price pumped up costs by nearly 200 basis points.        
	For the April-June 2009 quarter, ICIs sales increased 7 per cent to Rs 238.55 crore, and profit after tax was Rs 69 crore.

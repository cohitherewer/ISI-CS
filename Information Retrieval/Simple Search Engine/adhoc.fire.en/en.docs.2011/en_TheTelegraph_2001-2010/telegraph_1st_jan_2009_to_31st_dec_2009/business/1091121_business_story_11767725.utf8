          OUR CORRESPONDENT                          CALL TRANSFER                                  
	New Delhi, Nov. 20: Mobile users can change service providers while retaining their old numbers by paying Rs 19, the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India today said.         
	Mobile number portability will be implemented in the metros and some other circles by December 20 and across India by March.        
	Operators can charge an amount less or equal to the Rs 19 fixed by Trai.        
	To change operators, a subscriber will have to request the new operator for a connection. The process will have to be completed in four days and the subscriber will have to give porting charges to the new operator.         
	The facility helps to increase competition among service providers and acts as a catalyst for better quality service, said Trai officials.        
	Two American companies, Telcordia and Syniverse, will provide portability services.

                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Pranab vows 10% cap on PSU stake sale
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Mukherjee: Clearing the air                                  
	New Delhi, Dec. 1: The government will divest only up to 10 per cent in state-run firms for the time being.         
	We will not sell more than 10 per cent in listed state-run firms at this stage, finance minister Pranab Mukherjee told the Rajya Sabha.         
	The finance ministry will complete the divestment in power utilities NTPC Ltd, Sutlej Jal Vidyut Nigam Limited (SJVN) and Rural Electrification Corporation Limited (REC) before the end of this fiscal.         
	The divestment of government shareholding in NTPC, SJVN and REC through public offering in the domestic market is under implementation. These public offerings are likely to be completed by March 31, 2010, Mukherjee said.        
	In NTPC and REC, a 5 per cent stake will be sold in the capital markets, while it will be 10 per cent in SJVN.         
	Mukherjee was trying to deflect criticism of the governments divestment policy from the Left. CPM Rajya Sabha MP Tapan Kumar Sen said the divestment policy was a plan to pave the way for creeping privatisation.         
	The policy, Sen said, will create an enabling situation for final privatisation of the public sector undertakings.         
	On November 5, the government had announced its divestment policy, under which all listed profitable PSUs were to place at least 10 per cent of their shares with the public.        
	All unlisted public sector units which have made profits in the past three years should tap the market.        
	Besides the proceeds from the sale will be used directly for social sector projects instead of being locked in the National Investment Fund.         
	Shares of some 10 listed state-run firms with less than 10 per cent public holding are consequently slated to be sold. Another 40 companies, which have been making profits for the last three years qualify for listing.         
	The government holds an 89.5 per cent stake in NTPC and 81.82 per cent in Rural Electrification Corporation. It has already divested stakes in two companies  NHPC and Oil India Ltd.         
	Sen today sought to dismiss the governments argument that divestments would see a larger section of the general public picking up stakes in government enterprises.        
	He said only a miniscule part of PSU capital was owned by the public.        
	Citing ONGC, SAIL and Bhel, Sen said a bulk of the shares offloaded in the market had been cornered by foreign institutional investors, corporate entities and rich private individuals.        
	Stimulus to stay        
	The government today said there was no proposal to withdraw in this financial year the fiscal stimulus packages.         
	It has been indicated that at present there is no proposal for the withdrawal of stimulus measures in 2009-10, minister of state for finance Namo Narain Meena told the Rajya Sabha in a written reply.

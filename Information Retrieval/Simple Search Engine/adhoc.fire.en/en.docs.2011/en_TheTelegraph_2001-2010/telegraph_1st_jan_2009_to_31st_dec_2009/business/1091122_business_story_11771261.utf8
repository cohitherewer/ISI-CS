	Hyderabad, Nov. 21 (PTI): The Central Bureau of Investigation today arrested Mahindra Satyams internal audit head V.S. Prabhakar Gupta for his alleged involvement in the multi-crore accounting fraud in Satyam Computer.        
	Gupta, who is senior vice-president and global head of Mahindra Satyams internal audit, held the same position in Satyam Computer. He was arrested on charges of fabricating account books and co-conspiring with the other accused.         
	Gupta was later produced in the CBI designated court, which sent him to judicial custody till November 26.

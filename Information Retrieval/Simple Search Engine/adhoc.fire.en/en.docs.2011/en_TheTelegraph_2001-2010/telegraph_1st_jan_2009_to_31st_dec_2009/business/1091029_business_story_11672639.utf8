The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Banks to set aside more for NPAs
                                                                                                               Banks to set aside more for NPAs
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Mumbai, Oct. 28: Banks will have to make an additional provisioning of at least Rs 13,000 crore by next September because of a rule tweak by the Reserve Bank yesterday.        
	In its monetary policy review, the RBI had stipulated that banks would have to ensure a minimum provisioning coverage of 70 per cent of their bad loans (non-performing assets in banking parlance).        
	Rating agency Crisil said today that the additional provisioning of Rs 13,000 crore was based on the NPAs as reported by banks as on March 31.        
	Several banks, including the SBI and ICICI Bank  two of the countrys leading banks  have a provision coverage that is well short of 70 per cent.        
	However, if the NPAs rise by 3 per cent as projected, the additional provisioning will rise to Rs 20,000 crore, Crisil added.        
	Crisil said the RBI measure would lead to a decline in the sectors profitability in the near term but would enhance the resilience of the banking sector to absorb loan losses.        
	It noted that banks had reported NPAs of 2.3 per cent of system advances as of March 31, while the NPA coverage was around 55 per cent.        
	Crisil believes that the banking systems NPAs will increase despite significant restructuring undertaken by banks in the past six months, it said.

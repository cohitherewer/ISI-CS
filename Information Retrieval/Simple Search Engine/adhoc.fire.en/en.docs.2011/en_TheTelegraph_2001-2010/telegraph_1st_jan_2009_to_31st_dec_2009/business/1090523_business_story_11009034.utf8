The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Mukesh land problem lingers 
                                                                                                               Mukesh land problem lingers 
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                               
	Mumbai, May 22: Bombay High Court today disposed of a petition by Mukesh Ambani-promoted Mumbai SEZ demanding speedier completion of the land acquisition process by the Raigad district administration. The court directed the company to approach the Supreme Court where at least six petitions challenging both the Land Acquisition Act and the SEZ Act are currently pending.         
	The Ambani-promoted company had moved the high court asking it to direct the Raigad district administration to complete the acquisition of land before the June 6 deadline under the Land Acquisition Act.         
	It argued that the district authorities had not completed the process two years after the Maharashtra government allowed the company to set up a multi-product SEZ in the region.         
	Farmers and activists opposing the Reliance SEZ in Raigad hailed the decision as a step in the right direction.         
	Activist Ulka Mahajan said, The Vilasrao Deshmukh government had assured farmers that the land acquisition process would be stopped, but it has not been stopped yet. On September 30 2008, the government conducted a referendum to seek the opinion of farmers. Ninety-five per cent farmers had clearly told they were not willing to give their fertile land, but the government remained silent.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Jet ready to make a dash for cash
                                                                                                               Jet ready to make a dash for cash
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Mumbai, Sept. 11: Jet Airways is in a mad scramble to raise money even as chairman Naresh Goyal grapples with one of the worst human resource disasters that any airline can face in the form of a pilots strike.        
	Goyal may soon have to confront another looming problem: Jets fund-raising efforts are in danger of going awry.        
	With a debt burden of Rs 16,188 crore on its books, the Rs 11,450-crore airline is in a desperate need for cash.         
	Jet Airways has been talking to bankers to raise roughly $400 million through a qualified institutional placement (QIP).        
	Sources say it may have to scale down the figure to $300 million. The question is not how much Jet needs, but how much it can manage to mop up through a QIP, said an investment banker.         
	Jet is in the process of appointing bankers for the QIP. The management has been talking to institutional investors both in India and overseas, including some Singapore-based funds but the response so far has been tepid. The strike will only worsen the perception, he said.         
	The Jet management was not available for comment.        
	The Street has already begun drawing comparisons between Jet and a number of real estate companies that had totted up huge debt numbers and even faced the prospect of bankruptcy.        
	There is an urgent need to infuse cash. The company has very high debt compared with its peers. The airline badly requires an equity infusion, said Enam Securities senior researcher Hemant Patel, who has been tracking the stock ever since it listed on the bourses.        
	The promoters of Jet own 80 per cent of the company, with 79.99 per cent held by Tail Winds and 0.01 per cent by Jet chairman in his personal capacity.        
	The airline suffered a net loss of Rs 225 crore for the quarter ended June 30, 2009 on a total income of Rs 2,428 crore. In the year ended March 31, 2009, Jet posted its highest-ever loss at Rs 961.4 crore.        
	Patel, however, believes that Jet can make a comeback if the aviation industry can deal with the problem of over-capacitythe reason why domestic full service airlines are struggling.        
	Its a huge operating leverage game. After all, this airline has seen operating margins in excess of 20 per cent, he said. Patel may have a point but the turbulence that Jet is facing is far from over.

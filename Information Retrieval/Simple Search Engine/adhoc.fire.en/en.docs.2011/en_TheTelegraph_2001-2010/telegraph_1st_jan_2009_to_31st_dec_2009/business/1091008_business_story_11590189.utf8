	Calcutta, Oct. 7: The Centre is in favour of increasing the minimum support price (MSP) for raw jute by Rs 300 per quintal. The proposal will be referred to the Cabinet soon.        
	We have received some suggestions from an industry body  the Indian Jute Mills Association  to increase the MSP for jute by Rs 300 per quintal and we completely support it, Union textiles minister Dayanidhi Maran said today on the sidelines of a seminar organised by the Jute Manufactures Development Council.        
	At present, the MSP for raw jute is Rs 1,375 per quintal. The Centre has increased jute MSP by over 50 per cent in the last five years and will continue to do so to cover the fluctuation in prices, the minister added.         
	Apparel exports        
	Maran said there was a 2-3 per cent growth in apparel exports during April-September against the same period last year. We are seeing positive trends, particularly in Europe and the US, Maran said.        
	Park push        
	Maran also urged the Bengal government to hasten the process of setting up jute parks in the state. Five jute parks, spread over 25-30 acres, are expected to come up in the state.

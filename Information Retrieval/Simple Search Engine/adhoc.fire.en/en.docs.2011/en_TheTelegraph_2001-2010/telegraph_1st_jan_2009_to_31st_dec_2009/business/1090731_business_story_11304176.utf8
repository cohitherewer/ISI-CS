The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Chunk of SAIL kitty for Bengal plants 
                                                                                                               Chunk of SAIL kitty for Bengal plants 
          JAYANTA ROY CHOWDHURY                          Roongta: Planned move                                  
	New Delhi, July 30: Steel Authority of India Ltd will spend Rs 3,340 crore of its Rs 10,300- crore planned expenditure this year to rebuild the IISCO plant in Burnpur.        
	We will spend about Rs 4,000 crore this year in Bengal and more in the coming years, said SAIL chairman S.K. Roongta.         
	The total cost of completely refurbishing the Burnpur facility, which will eventually make nearly 3 million tonnes of hot metal, will be Rs 14,443 crore.         
	IISCO has an antiquated plant in Burnpur, which churns out about 4 lakh tonnes of steel a year.         
	A new blast furnace with a capacity of 4060 cubic metres, SAILs largest so far, will be set up at the Burnpur site. SAIL has not built a furnace in the last three decades.         
	The IISCO modernisation project includes a coke oven battery, two sinter machines, a new blast furnace and a new wire rod and bar mill.         
	The state-run steel maker plans to spend more than Rs 18,000 crore on its plants in the state. Apart from the IISCO plant, another Rs 3,500 crore will be spent to modernise Durgapur and Alloy Steels plants and build specialised metal works facilities at Kulti.         
	Bengal has been a favoured destination for steel makers because of abundant coal supply, good rail and road linkages with the rest of the country, besides port facilities at Haldia. Orissa and Jharkhands iron ore mines provide easy access to raw materials.         
	However, because of a downturn in global steel prices and industry, most steel makers have put on hold their expansion plans.         
	Meanwhile, SAIL today reported a first-quarter net profit of Rs 1,326.09 crore, a 27.74 per cent decline over the year-ago period. Total income declined to Rs 9,692.76 crore from Rs 11,228.24 crore in the same period last year              
	Meanwhile, SAILs net profit fell 28 per cent to Rs 1,326.09 crore. Net sales realization was lower at 18 per cent as steel prices have fallen sharply since mid-2008 while coal prices went up by nearly 50 per cent, officials said.                                
	The Burnpur based IISCO which owned the iron rich Chiria mines was merged with the state run steel giant some time back to help give SAIL, a much needed raw material base. Officials said the IISCO modernisation had been planned in such a manner that its product mix will complement that of Durgapur.               
	SAIL today also announced its rsults for the fiscal first quarter which fell 28 per cent at Rs 1,326.09 crore.        
	Net profit fell due to an 18 per cent lower net sales realization as steel prices have fallen sharply since mid-2008 while coal prices went up by nearly 50 per cent, officials said.              
	Eom

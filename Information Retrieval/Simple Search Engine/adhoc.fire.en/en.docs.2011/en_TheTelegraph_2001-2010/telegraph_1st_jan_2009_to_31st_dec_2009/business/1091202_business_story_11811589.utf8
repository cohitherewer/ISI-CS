The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Posco does a Karnataka recce

	Dec. 1: Posco may follow big brother ArcelorMittal to Karnataka after waiting for more than four years in Orissa.        
	A Posco official confirmed having met Karnataka government officials but said no proposal was made.        
	Company officials visited Karnataka and saw the facilities available there. However, no decision was taken, the official at Poscos corporate office in Bhubaneswar said.        
	The Karnataka industry department had invited Posco to the state and some officials had visited Bangalore about a month ago, a government source said.        
	Karnataka industries minister Murugesh Nirani said discussions with Posco were on, but they were at a preliminary stage. They are yet to make an application. Only initial enquiries were made, an official added.        
	Posco, unlike ArcelorMittal, has been betting solely on Orissa for its entry into India, which is the only market apart from China where steel demand is growing despite the global economic slowdown.        
	Posco had signed a memorandum of understanding to invest $12 billion in iron-rich Orissa in 2005. The erstwhile Mittal Steel had signed a similar deal in neighbouring Jharkhand promising an investment of $10 billion.        
	But both the projects ran into trouble over land acquisition.        
	While Posco waited patiently, Mittal went to Orissa and signed up for another steel plant in late 2006.        
	But none of the three projects has made much headway in the last three years, prompting both Mittal and Posco to consider Karnataka.        
	Incidentally, Mittal and Posco have not abandoned any of their projects in the eastern states though both voiced their displeasure over the delay.        
	Posco remains firm on its commitment to the Orissa project and its the No. 1 priority for the company, the Posco official said today.        
	He recalled that Posco chief executive officer Joon Yang Chung and Posco India chairman Dong-He Lee had separately met Orissa chief minister Naveen Patnaik and reaffirmed the companys commitment to the Orissa project.        
	Chung had announced that the company would set up a foundation for carrying out social welfare activities in the project-affected areas. The foundation has already been set up.        
	ArcelorMittal has inspected land in northern districts of Karnataka and a decision on the plants location is expected soon, the state said last week.         
	Nirani said once the firm decided on the location, the government would try to complete the land acquisition in six months.        
	Between January and August 2009, Karnataka had given approvals to nine integrated steel projects, including a proposed NMDC plant, across the states northern districts of Bagalkot, Bellary and Koppal.        
	We have made a steel zone at Bellary and so more people are showing interest, said a senior government officer.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Fillip for eastern freight corridor
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Fillip for eastern freight corridor

	New Delhi, Dec. 4: Prime Minister Manmohan Singh today took up cabinet colleague Mamata Banerjees pet project  a Rs 22,000-crore freight corridor linking New Delhi with Dankuni  with visiting World Bank president Robert B. Zoellick.        
	The government wants the World Bank to bankroll the ambitious project, which will give Bengals factories and ports faster access to raw materials from the north.         
	To begin with, the World Bank will lend up to $1.8 billion for a section of the eastern freight corridor linking the busy Mughalsarai freight junction with Khurja. However, the funds would start flowing only after July 2010, by when bank experts would have completed feasibility studies for the whole project.        
	Soon after his meeting with Singh, Zoellick said, We discussed a partnership with the Indian government for its eastern railroad freight corridor.         
	World Bank officials said they were considering advancing substantial soft loans for the whole of the eastern dedicated freight corridor.        
	The Left parties are supporting the project but may find it difficult to accept the World Bank as the sponsor for the project. CPI leader D. Raja told The Telegraph, These loans always come with conditions attached ... they are not good for the country.         
	Railway ministry officials, however, say World Bank funding has fewer, if any, strings attached compared with Japanese support, which include clauses that force India to appoint Japanese prime contractors and buy at least 30 per cent of equipment from Japan.        
	The Japanese government is funding the Rs 26,000-crore western freight corridor linking Delhi with Mumbai , work on which has already started.         
	However, the eastern project still remains on the Rail Bhawans drawing boards. Which is possibly why Singh himself discussed the project with Zoellick, say officials.        
	The World Bank will also lend $400 million towards a rolling stock upgrade as part of plans to lend up to $7 billion this year to India for infrastructure projects.         
	The World Bank also wants the government to expand the countrys own capital base. We all look at India now as a rising global economic power, said Zoellick.         
	The larger growth challenge for India is to look 15-20 years ahead ... the Indian government has been working with Japan on the western corridor, the eastern corridor will be another important future project, Zoellick said.         
	The two freight corridors together will be one of the most ambitious projects the railways has ever taken up. Once completed, they will meet the transport requirements of two busy trunk routes for the next 15 to 20 years.        
	The eastern corridor, the modalities for which are still being worked out, will stretch 1,806km from Ludhiana in Punjab to Dankuni near Calcutta. It will be extended in future to serve a new deep sea port near Calcutta and will largely serve metal and mineral-based industries.

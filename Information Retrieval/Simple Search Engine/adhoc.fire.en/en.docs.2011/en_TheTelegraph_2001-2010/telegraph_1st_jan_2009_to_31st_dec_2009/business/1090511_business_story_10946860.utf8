The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Tatas gear up to raise 1 billion for Jaguar 
                                                                                                               Tatas gear up to raise 1 billion for Jaguar 
                            
	London, May 10 (PTI): The Tatas-owned Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) is planning to raise up to 1 billion by September to keep the cash-starved company afloat without the British governments help, The Guardian said.        
	The Tatas have mandated financial adviser Citigroup to find banks that have solid credit ratings and are prepared to underwrite some of the 340million loan pledged by the European Investment Bank (EIB).        
	JLR is also looking to tap the debt markets to help secure the 500 million to 1 billion short-term financing package needed, the newspaper said. Even if the Tatas can raise more debt and find banks willing to underwrite part of the EIB loans, the cost of the financing will be very high, The Guardian said.        
	According to the report, the Tata group, which controls JLR through its subsidiary Tata Motors, will cut or freeze investment plans for new models. More redundancies from its 15,000-strong workforce are also likely.         
	The UK government had revealed its conditions for underwriting part of the EIB loan for the Tatas. These include giving the government the right to appoint a chairman to JLR, a guarantee that the Tatas will not make any redundancies and provide an additional large injection into the firm.        
	However, the Tatas have rejected the governments conditions for underwriting some of the EIB loan to secure immediate and short-term help. The Indian firm, which remains committed to Jaguar Land Rover, believes it can secure better terms independently, the daily said.        
	Regret over buys        
	Ratan Tata has said his two acquisitions  Anglo-Dutch steelmaker Corus and British marques Jaguar and Land Rover  were done at an inopportune time and his company might have gone too far too fast.        
	In an interview published in The Sunday Times, Tata admitted with hindsight that he might have gone too far too fast. If one had known there was going to be a meltdown, then yes (Tata went too far), but nobody knew. Both the acquisitions were made, I would say, at an inopportune time in the sense that they were near the top of the market in terms of price, the Tata group chairman said.         
	Tata Steel paid 6.7 billion for Corus, making it the most expensive steel deal to date by an Indian company. A year later, Tata Motors paid 1.15 billion for JLR.

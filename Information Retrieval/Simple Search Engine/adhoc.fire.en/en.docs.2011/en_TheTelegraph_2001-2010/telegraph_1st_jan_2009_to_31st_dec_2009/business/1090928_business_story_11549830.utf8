                                                          Oil ministry formula for land 

     JAYANTA ROY CHOWDHURY
                  COMPENSATION STRATEGY
   Five per cent of oil royalty should go to the displaced
 Half of royalty sum for village administrative bodies, 25%
 to development blocks and rest to district bodies
 Not more than 5% of money received by local bodies to 
 be used for administrative 
 expenses
 Of the rest, at least 50% should be given to land 
 losers; remaining is for 
 community development
   
	New Delhi, Sept. 27: The oil ministry has proposed that 5 per cent of the governments oil and gas royalties should go back to those displaced by exploration and drilling activities.
    
	In fiscal 2008-09, state governments earned Rs 2,409.22 crore as royalty from oil and gas companies, while the Centre received Rs 4,045.54 crore. If both the Centre and states give 5 per cent a year to the displaced, the amount can be over Rs 300 crore. 
    
	Under a draft prepared by the ministry, half of the amount should be given to the village administrative bodies, 25 per cent to the development blocks  which are a higher tier of administration in the villages  and the rest to district bodies. 
    
	The draft awaits the approval of the cabinet.
    
	The rule tweak comes in the wake of agitations by local communities against land acquisition for mining and industrial projects. 
    
	Trinamool Congress leader Mamata Banerjees protests against land takeover by the Bengal government at Singur and Nandigram had led to her landslide victory in the elections to Parliament and state local bodies.
    
	Worldwide, the compensation varies. In Americas Alaska, oil firms pay 2 per cent of their gross revenues; in Indonesia it is 6 per cent; and in Nigeria, 13. 
    
	The Indian government, which prepared its draft on the basis of a report by a consultant, decided to take a modest course to fix the rate at 5 per cent.
    
	States may not be happy with the revenue loss. Gujarat, Andhra Pradesh, Arunachal Pradesh, Assam, Tripura, Rajasthan and Tamil Nadu are among the top royalty grossers from oil. 
    
	Gujarat earned Rs 761 crore in 2008-09, Assam Rs 1,388 crore and Tamil Nadu, around Rs 127.55 crore.
    
	The oil ministrys draft rules also say that not more than 5 per cent of the royalty amount received by the local bodies can be used as administrative expenses.
    
	Of the rest, at least 50 per cent should be given to those who have lost their land. 
    
	The remaining can be spent on community development. 
    
	Land owners, who had to give up their land for the laying of oil pipelines, will be compensated separately.

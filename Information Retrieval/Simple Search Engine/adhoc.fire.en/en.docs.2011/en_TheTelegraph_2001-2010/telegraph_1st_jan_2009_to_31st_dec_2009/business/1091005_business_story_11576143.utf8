The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Slowdown shadow on SEZs
                                                                                                               Slowdown shadow on SEZs
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                            
	New Delhi, Oct. 4: A slowdown in the economy has forced developers of some special economic zones to withdraw their proposals. As many as 10 developers have approached the government to denotify their planned units.        
	The board of approval for SEZs will take a decision on the exit proposals at its meeting on October 5.        
	The withdrawal plea has been sought for three SEZs in Maharashtra, two each in Punjab and Tamil Nadu and one each in Bengal, Kerala and Karnataka. The board will also take a call on setting up a panel that will meet every week to look into the routine approvals required for tax-free industrial enclaves.        
	Of the units that want to exit, nine have the formal approval as they have land under possession; one is notified and eligible for tax benefits.              
	The board had earlier cleared more than five exit proposals of notified infotech SEZs on the condition that they would cease to enjoy the tax sops after the withdrawal.        
	Tax concessions for SEZs include duty-free import, 100 per cent exemption on export income for the first five years followed by a 50 per cent discount for the next five years and a 50 per cent relief on the ploughed back export profit for the next five years.         
	The special zones are eligible for external commercial borrowings of up to $500 million a year without any maturity restriction. They are also exempted from various central and state levies.         
	Ambani project        
	The Mukesh Ambani-promoted Navi Mumbai SEZ has asked the government to scrap the condition of maintaining geographical contiguity for the project. If the condition is not fulfilled, the government will not give its approval to companies interested in setting up units in the area.        
	The board of approval cleared the multi-product SEZ on the condition that the developer would build the required underpasses and bridges before the units were set up in the zone.        
	According to the governments instructions, the developer is expected to set up three bridges and five underpasses. The Navi Mumbai SEZ has proposed that it should be allowed to build two skywalks instead of the flyovers.        
	The zones getting in-principle approval have to complete land acquisition within one year of the approval. An SEZ having a formal approval along with land under possession has to operationalise the tax-free enclaves within three years. Exports from SEZs in the first quarter of 2009-10 were valued at Rs 34,000 crore. Shipments from SEZs grew 36 per cent to Rs 90,416 crore in 2008-09.

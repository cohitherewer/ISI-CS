The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Foreign funds on a buying spree
                                                                                                               Foreign funds on a buying spree
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                            
	Mumbai, April 1: The Big Bucks are starting to flow into the country once again.        
	Foreign institutional investors (FIIs) shovelled more money into the Indian markets than they pulled out of it in March  only the third time in all of 2008-09 that the money tide flowed inward.        
	Data put out by the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) showed that the FIIs had made net purchases worth $131.60 million (or Rs 530.30 crore) in the last month of fiscal 2008-09.        
	There were only two months during the year that the fund flows had been positive: December and April 2008.        
	The foreign investors, who have sold well in excess of Rs 47,000 crore during the whole year, had been net sellers during the remaining nine months even as the benchmark index tumbled 38 per cent between the first day and the last day of the financial year.        
	However, fiscal 2009-10 today began on a positive note with the BSE sensex gaining nearly 193 points.        
	Market circles attribute various reasons for foreign investors turning net buyers in March. Experts said while actions taken by the US government to tackle the financial and economic crisis led to the recovery in its markets, the impact was felt here as well with foreign investors making purchases.        
	The US and the UK governments have been trying hard to put the financial system back on track. It has yielded some results, Hitesh Agrawal, head of research at Angel Broking, told The Telegraph.         
	Agrawal added that the Geithner plan which was announced recently to release toxic assets from the financial system, had led to some liquidity infusion into the system.        
	This is beginning to play out and it has reduced the risk aversion among investors and, therefore, there is some kind of investment flowing into emerging markets, he said.        
	Gaurav Dua, head of research at Sharekhan, felt that while FII inflows into emerging markets had turned positive due to an expectation that global equities were likely to bounce back, one additional factor was the growing valuation gap between developed and emerging markets.        
	India is better placed than some of the emerging markets in this regard and we saw its impact in the form of FII inflows during the month, Dua said.        
	The question now being asked is whether the positive flows will be sustainable at least for the next few months.        
	Ambareesh Baliga, vice-president at Karvy Stock Broking, felt that net inflows would not be sustainable till the election results were out.        
	One thing most FIIs look for is political stability. Unless we know that, we will not see money coming. Post elections, if there is a stable government, we could see money coming back and there could be a decent rally, Baliga said.        
	Agrawal said the FII inflow was an indication that the sentiment was a lot better than the start of the year.        
	The index may not slide to 8000 levels. But the near term hiccup for the markets is the election. Once clarity emerges, the scenario will become clear, Agrawal added.

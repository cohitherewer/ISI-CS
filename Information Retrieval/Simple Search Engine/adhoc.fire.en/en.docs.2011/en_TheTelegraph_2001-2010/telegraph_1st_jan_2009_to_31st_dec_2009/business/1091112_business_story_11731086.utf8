          OUR CORRESPONDENT                          Rangarajan: Strict vigil                                  
	New Delhi, Nov. 11: The central bank may resort to monetary tightening if inflationary pressures rise in November-December, according to C. Rangarajan, chairman of the Economic Advisory Council to the Prime Minister.         
	If inflation pressures develop, monetary authorities may take measures earlier. The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) will wait and see how the price situation develops in the next two months, Rangarajan said.        
	Wholesale price-based inflation is on the rise, driven by food prices, and analysts expect the rate to exceed the RBIs target of 6.5 per cent by March. Inflation was at 1.51 per cent for the week ended October 17.         
	Food inflation is hovering around 15 per cent, burning a hole in the pocket of the ordinary people. However, food prices often fall in November-December as fresh vegetables and fruits flood the market at this time.        
	Economists said that RBI could be among the first central banks in Asia to increase interest rates. The Australian central bank is the first major central bank to tighten policy since the global financial crisis struck.

                                Should every individual who has been allotted a PAN card file income tax return?          Deepak Kumar Chowdhury, Titagarh
                    ot necessarily. Income tax return has to be filed compulsorily if an individuals total annual income is above the basic exemption limit before any tax deduction or rebate.                                    Form 15H not required      I shall be 65-years-old on October 10 this year. Can I submit Form 15H this year to my bank?        Basudeb Sarkar, Konnagar
                    No, you cannot. Form 15H is meant for senior citizens who have attained 65 years of age before April 2009.                                  Mutual benefit      I am a senior citizen. In 2005 and 2006, I invested in two mutual fund schemes. In November 2008, I redeemed all the units of both the funds. How should I show the gain in my income tax return? Can I use ITR I?        D. Tiwari, Ballygunj
                    der Section 10(38) of the Income Tax Act, long-term capital gains arising from transfer of a unit of mutual fund is exempt from tax if the transaction is undertaken after October 1, 2004 and the securities transaction tax is paid. You dont have to show this capital gain in your tax return. You can use ITR I for filing income tax return.                                    The right option      My wife is 62-years-old. She doesnt have any income except the interest she will get on FDs of Rs 2,50,000 each in three banks made in 2008 for a period of one year. She got the money as gift from her son. Two banks have asked her to file Form 15H, but one asked her to file Form 15G. Which is correct?         S.K. Sharma, Calcutta
                    der income tax law, a senior citizen is one who has attained 65 years of age. So, your wife cannot file Form 15H. She should submit Form 15G.

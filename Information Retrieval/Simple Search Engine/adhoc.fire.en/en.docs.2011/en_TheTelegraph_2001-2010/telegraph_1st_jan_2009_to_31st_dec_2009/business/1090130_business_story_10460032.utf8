	Mumbai, Jan. 29: German drug firm Merck will launch more than 25 products in India this year.        
	It is also looking at acquisitions to meet its target of earning 500 million euros in the country by 2012.        
	According to Marek Dziki, managing director of Merck Ltd (India), around 10 of the new products will be over-the-counter drugs, while the rest will be prescription medicines.

	Dziki was speaking to reporters after the launch of Femibion, a drug for women suffering from iron deficiency.

	Femibion, a dietary supplement for the quick replenishment of iron reserves, will be priced at Rs 2.50 per capsule.         
	Dziki said the total anti-anaemia market in India was over Rs 740 crore and growing at 13.4 per cent.

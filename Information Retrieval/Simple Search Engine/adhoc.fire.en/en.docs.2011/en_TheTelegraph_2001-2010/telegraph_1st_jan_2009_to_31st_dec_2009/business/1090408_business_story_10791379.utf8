                                                                                                               Pension regulator calls for tax relief 
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                                            
	New Delhi, April 7: The interim pension regulator would seek tax exemption on withdrawals under the new pension system after the polls.        
	We will take up the issue when the new government is formed, said D. Swarup, chairman of the Pension Fund Regulatory and Development Authority. Earlier, too, Swarup had sought exemption, but it was not granted.        
	While contributions, returns and withdrawals under public provident fund, employee provident fund and general provident fund are tax exempted, in the new pension system, contributions and returns do not attract tax. However, withdrawals are taxed.         
	The new pension system is for central government employees who had joined from January 1, 2004. Under it, both employee and employer (the government) contribute equally. Besides the Centre, as many as 21 states have adopted the system.         
	The regulator is now all set to introduce the scheme among all citizens from May 1.        
	For this, it will come out with investment norms by the middle of this month.         
	However, the scheme for all citizens will not have any provision of mandatory contribution from employers.        
	The Deepak Parekh committee, constituted by the regulator, has recommended investment norms for the new pension scheme.        
	It had suggested investment in shares of the 50 stocks of National Stock Exchanges Nifty, government bonds, liquid assets of mutual funds, state government bonds, rated bonds of public financial institutions and public sector companies.        
	The regulator had invited public comments on the recommendations. In August 2008, the government advised the pension regulator to extend the scheme to all citizens.        
	Earlier, the regulator had a plan to launch the scheme for all citizens from April 1, but it was deferred by the government, citing the model code of conduct.        
	The regulator has already appointed six fund managers  SBI, UTI Asset Management, ICICI Prudential Life Insurance, Reliance MF, IDFC Mutual Fund and Kotak Mahindra  to manage the funds.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Regulators meet SA delegation
                                                                                                               Regulators meet SA delegation
          OUR BUREAU                              
	Sept. 24: A South African delegation met senior officials of Sebi and the RBI to discuss the terms of the proposed Bharti-MTN deal.        
	The meeting was attended by Sebi executive director Usha Narayanan, wholetime member Prashant Saran and RBIs chief general manager (foreign exchange department) Salim Gangadaran, among others.        
	The South African team comprised officials from the National Treasury and South African Reserve Bank.        
	The meeting, called by the finance ministry to discuss the multi-billion dollar deal, is understood to have deliberated regulatory hurdles holding back the merger, including the issue of dual listing.        
	Under dual listing, securities are listed on more than one exchange for the purpose of adding liquidity to the shares and offering investors a choice on where they want to trade.         
	Earlier, finance minister Pranab Mukherjee had said, We welcome the deal, but it should be in the context of existing laws of the land. These have to be kept in mind.         
	However, in what could be a dampener for Bharti and MTN, the government today said dual listing, as sought by South Africa, might not be possible as it needed a policy change on rupee convertibility. A policy change on the full convertibility of the rupee is not possible at present, commerce and industry minister Anand Sharma said.

                                                                                                               ITC profit up 26%

	Oct. 23: ITC today beat analysts estimates to post a 26 per cent rise in second-quarter net profit, helped by a good performance in all its businesses, except hotels.        
	Net profit for the July-September period rose to Rs 1,009.91 crore from Rs 802.72 crore a year earlier.        
	Total income rose to Rs 4,413.72 crore from Rs 3,973.12 crore in the corresponding period last fiscal, on the back of higher sales at its tobacco and non-tobacco consumer goods segments, agribusiness and paperboards businesses, the company said.        
	The results beat analysts expectations of net profit of Rs 912 crore on a revenue of Rs 4,149 crore.        
	Analysts expected the hotels business to be a drag on ITCs results. The hotel industry was severely hit in the aftermath of the Mumbai terrorist attacks and global recession.         
	The swine flu added to the woes of the industry.        
	The reduction in corporate travel, both domestic and international, continued to impact the hotels business. De-growth in occupancies and average room rates persisted during the quarter, ITC said.        
	Net revenue from hotels declined 24 per cent to Rs 174.04 crore. The company said it expected the business to gain pace in the second half of the current fiscal on the back of improvement of occupancies.        
	Net revenue from the FMCG business grew 19 per cent to Rs 3,063.02 crore, while the agri-business revenue stood at Rs 1,028.28 crore  also up 19 per cent over the year-ago period.        
	Shares of ITC closed at Rs 259.85, up 4.97 per cent over the previous close of Rs 247.55 on the BSE.        
	British American Tobacco PLC owns a 32 per cent stake in Calcutta-based ITC.

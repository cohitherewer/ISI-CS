                                                                                                               Sebi gets access to Raju
          OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT                            Ramalinga Raju and Rama Raju: Quiz time                                
	New Delhi, Feb. 3: The Supreme Court today allowed the Securities and Exchange Board of India to quiz the Raju brothers of Satyam Computer for three days from tomorrow.        
	Sebi had moved the apex court after a Hyderabad magistrate and then Andhra Pradesh High Court denied it permission to interrogate Satyam founder Ramalinga Raju and his brother Rama Raju on the grounds that the market regulator was not an investigative agency.        
	An apex court bench headed by Chief Justice K. G. Balakrishnan directed the superintendent of Andhras Chanchalguda central prison to allow Sebis investigating officer Sunil Kumar to question the Rajus.         
	Sebi had been trying to quiz the duo since January 8  the day after Ramalinga Raju disclosed a Rs 7,100-crore fraud in Satyam.         
	The Rajus became inaccessible following their arrest by the Andhra Pradesh CID on January 9.        
	Sebi would be probing if there was any insider trading, which would have helped to inflate share prices.        
	Arguing on behalf of Sebi, solicitor-general G. E. Vahanvati said the interrogation and the recording of statement were necessary to verify facts as documents were going out of the country. He said the regulator was not seeking custody of the Rajus, but only permission to quiz them.         
	In its petition before the apex court, the regulator said the high court should have ensured that the Raju brothers could not use judicial custody as a shield to avoid probe by expert agencies.        
	The judge ought to have seen Section 167 (2) Criminal Procedure Code, which gives a magistrate power to authorise the detention of the accused in such custody as he thinks fit, the petition said.        
	The petition further stated that Sebi had powers and obligations under the Sebi Act, 1992 to investigate, but was being thwarted at every stage.        
	Sebi said the refusal to permit it to even record the statements of the accused while in custody was arbitrary, unreasonable and perverse.         
	Maytas Infra, promoted by the Raju family and a subject of government investigation, today said it would form a task force to restore investor confidence and provide assistance in managerial activities.

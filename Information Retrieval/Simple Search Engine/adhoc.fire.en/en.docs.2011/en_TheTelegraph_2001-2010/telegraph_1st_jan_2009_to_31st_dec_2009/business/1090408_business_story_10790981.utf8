          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Venu Srinivasan in Calcutta on Tuesday. A Telegraph picture                                  
	Calcutta, April 7: The Confederation of Indian Industry (CII) plans to play an active role in building a consensus among political parties on thorny issues such as land acquisition and contract farming.        
	It has already taken up this initiative in Chhattisgarh.         
	Mukul Somany, eastern region chairman of the CII, said the chamber had managed to draw up a minimum economic programme after talking to major political parties.         
	Definitely, we would be keen, he said when asked if such an initiative would be taken up in Bengal.         
	He was speaking at a press interaction with CII president Venu Srinivasan. Director-general Chandrajit Banerjee said the CII would focus on three broad areas in Bengal  manufacturing, services with a special focus on tourism, and private sector intervention in agriculture.        
	We want the private sector to come into contract farming  provide technology and support to farmers so that they can produce better quality crop, Srinivasan said. The CII team that met chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee suggested that Bengal take up contract farming.

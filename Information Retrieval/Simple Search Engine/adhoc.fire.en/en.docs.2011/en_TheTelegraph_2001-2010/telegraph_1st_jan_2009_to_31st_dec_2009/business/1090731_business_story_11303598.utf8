The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Steel set to witness rapid rise in demand 
                                                                                                               Steel set to witness rapid rise in demand 
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Calcutta, July 30: The domestic steel sector is set to grow exponentially, Tata Steel managing director B. Muthuraman today said.        
	At a press meet organised by the Indian Institute of Metals, Muthuraman said Indian steel was reaching an inflexion point from where demand could zoom.        
	Indias per capita consumption of steel is 50 kg per year compared with Chinas 270 kg a year and the USs 400 kg a year.        
	When we reach 80-90 kg in 3-4 years, the market will take off, he said.        
	Muthuraman predicted a 6 per cent growth rate for domestic steel.        
	Consumption, though, is projected to be down 15 per cent, globally, with China and India being the exceptions.        
	Sanak Mishra, chief executive officer (greenfield projects, India) of ArcelorMittal, however, was reluctant to share Muthuramans optimism.        
	This year, it (steel) may grow 5-6 per cent if the government spends on infrastructure. Beyond that it will be hard to predict, he said.        
	Mishra today was elected president of the Indian Institute of Metals for 2009-10. Muthuraman held the post two years back.        
	According to Mishra, it will be difficult for the country to grow if the global scenario remains bad.        
	ArcelorMittal, however, is betting big on India. The company, owned by Lakshmi Mittal, has promised to build two steel plants of 12 million tonnes each.         
	Yesterday, Mittal had said he was keen on the projects despite the delay in execution.        
	The steel industry grew 10 per cent in the last fiscal in India. Globally, steel grew 6 per cent during 2000-2008 compared with only 1.1 per cent between 1975 and 2000.

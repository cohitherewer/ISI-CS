The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | PC sales take a beating
                                                                                                               PC sales take a beating
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                                            
	New Delhi, March 16: The slowdown virus seems to have affected the sales of personal computers. For the last three months of 2008, sales fell 19 per cent over the corresponding period of the previous year.         
	According to data released by the Manufacturers Association of Information Technology (MAIT), PC sales, including laptops and desktops, fell to around 14 lakh units during the October-December period. Sales of desktops stood at 10 lakh units, while notebook sales were at 3.5 lakh units.         
	Sales have been impacted by poor demand from retail, IT and small and medium enterprises because of concerns over liquidity and the general economy, said Vinnie Mehta, executive director of MAIT. Households, too, deferred their purchases because of the slowdown.        
	According to MAIT chief, manufacturers could not consider price reductions because the depreciating rupee had raised costs.        
	Mehta hoped that the January-March quarter would be better and expected sales for 2008-09 to be at 73 lakh, the same as the last fiscal.        
	With less-than-expected sales among households and enterprises, desktops recorded a 15 per cent decline in consumption, while sales of notebooks fell 30 per cent over the same period last year, Mehta said.         
	Among enterprises, the major buyers are telecom, banking and educational firms. The central and state governments are also major buyers for their e-governance initiatives.        
	According to a study by MAIT and the IMRB, the smaller and lesser-known regional brands and unbranded players accounted for 39 per cent of desktop sales in the third quarter of 2008-09. Branded desktops constituted 61 per cent. In branded desktops, multinationals accounted for 48 per cent and the domestic brands the rest.         
	The consumption of servers fell 49 per cent in the third quarter, with only 21,000 units being sold. Printer sales also declined.

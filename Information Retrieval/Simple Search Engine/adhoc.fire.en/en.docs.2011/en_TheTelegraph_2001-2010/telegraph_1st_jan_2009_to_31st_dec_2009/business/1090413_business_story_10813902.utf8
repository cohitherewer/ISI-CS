	 New Delhi, April 12: The country may import 3 million tonnes of raw sugar this season till September-end because of the price parity with the international market and the governments decision to do away with the obligation to export an equivalent amount of refined sugar. Mills have contracted 1.5 million tonnes of raw sugar so far, of which 7,00,000 tonnes have already landed at various ports. We expect a total of 3 million tonnes of raw sugar contracts by September as parity has improved on account of firm sugar prices in the domestic market, a top industry official said.

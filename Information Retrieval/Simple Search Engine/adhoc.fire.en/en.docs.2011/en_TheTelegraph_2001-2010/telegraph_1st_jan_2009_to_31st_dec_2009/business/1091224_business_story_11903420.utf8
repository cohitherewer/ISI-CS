	Calcutta, Dec. 23: Provident fund subscribers may be able to access their accounts and push for an online settlement of claims by 2011.        
	The Employees Provident Fund Organisation (EPFO) is aiming to create an inter-connected online platform for its 117 regional and sub-regional offices that will eventually allow online settlement of claims within a day or two.        
	The EPFO is one of the last bastions of bureaucratic outfits that is being sucked into the online platform managed by the National Informatics Centre (NIC).        
	P. Sudhakar Babu, additional central PF commissioner, said a trial run was being carried out at five centres: Karnal, Delhi, Hyderabad, Mangalore and Nasik.        
	Another 15 centres will be networked by the end of this month. We are aiming to bring all our centres onto the online platform in 2010, Babu said here today while addressing a seminar organised by the Social Security Association of India.        
	Once all the regional and sub-regional provident fund offices are connected, EPFO members will be able to get their claims settled overnight. They will also be able to access other information such as the account balance.        
	Babu also said the EPFOs proposed project of providing member subscribers with a unique identity card would be taken up in the second phase.         
	This may be integrated with the governments UID project if the later is ready by then, he added.        
	Meanwhile, the EPFO is being increasingly burdened with unclaimed deposits  money that subscribers dont withdraw after they switch jobs or prefer to keep the money in the account and continue to earn interest on their deposits. Some deposits remain unclaimed after the death of PF subscribers because their heirs do not have the relevant details of the accounts.        
	The EPF money continues to earn the declared rate of interest till the time it remains with the EPFO. Unclaimed deposits rose from Rs 635 crore in 2003 to Rs 3,837 crore in 2008, accounting for 1.3 per cent of EPFOs total corpus of Rs 2.95 lakh crore.

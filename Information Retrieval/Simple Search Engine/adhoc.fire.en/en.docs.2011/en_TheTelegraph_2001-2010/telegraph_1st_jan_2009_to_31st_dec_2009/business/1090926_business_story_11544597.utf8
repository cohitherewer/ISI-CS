	Mumbai, Sept. 25 (PTI): Capital market watchdog Sebi today called for a meaningful dialogue between regulators and market players to ensure better corporate governance as well as greater compliance with environmental and social standards.        
	Sebi will watch corporate governance trends of companies and discuss with other regulatory agencies to seek ways to improve the environmental, social and governance (ESG) standards of companies, chairman C.B. Bhave said at a conference here.        
	We want to have a dialogue with other regulatory agencies. We are happy to discuss this with the Reserve Bank, the government and other agencies, Bhave said.        
	The countrys exchanges can also contemplate the idea of categorising companies in terms of ESG compliance. The initiatives should come from the companies themselves as ESG values cannot be imposed on the market by mere regulation, Bhave said.         
	Crackdown on Parekh links        
	Sebi today confirmed an order banning brokers Harsh and Jai Shirish Maniar and other entities from participating in the markets for their alleged role in manipulative trading, in which front entities of Ketan Parekh appear to have been involved.

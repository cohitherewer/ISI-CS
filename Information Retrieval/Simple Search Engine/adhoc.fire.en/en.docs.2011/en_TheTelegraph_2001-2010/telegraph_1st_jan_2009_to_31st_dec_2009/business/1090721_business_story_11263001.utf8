The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Tea exports take a dip
                                                                                                               Tea exports take a dip
          A STAFF REPORTER                                            
	Calcutta, July 20: A drop in production and a firm domestic demand led to an 18.5 per cent decline in tea exports during the January-May period.         
	Statistics of the Indian Tea Association (ITA) showed that exports fell to 60 million kg during the period from 73.7 million kg a year ago.        
	India exports CTCs mainly to Egypt, Pakistan and the UK and premium orthodox to Iraq, Iran and Russia.        
	Domestic demand is good and the local prices are high. That is why exports are falling. There is also a crop shortage because of the unfavourable weather, an industry expert said.        
	Price realisation from exports, however, rose 7 per cent during the period under review, according to the ITA data. In value terms, exports increased to Rs 775.03 crore between January and May from Rs 727.34 crore in the same period last year. Rise in domestic consumption pushed up prices to Rs 129.1 per kg from Rs 98.74 per kg in the year-ago period. Prices during May were Rs 138.13 compared with Rs 103.35 last year.        
	During the first five months of the year, domestic production declined 10 per cent to 215.8 million kg. India, China, Sri Lanka, Indonesia and Kenya produce 75 per cent of the total global output.        
	During January-April, production fell 15 per cent to 144.5 million kg. Output had touched 170 million kg during the same period in 2008.

          OUR CORRESPONDENT                          Shuffle mode                                  
	New Delhi, March 13: Japans Nissan Motor Company today made some key management changes in India.        
	It has appointed Akira Sakurai as managing director and CEO of its joint venture Renault Nissan Automotive India Private Limited (RNAIPL).        
	At present, Sakurai is general manager of the vehicle production engineering division and his appointment will take effect from next month.        
	Kiminobu Tokuyama, managing director and chief operating officer of Nissan Motor India, has been appointed managing director and CEO.        
	Tokuyama takes over from Shohei Kimura, CEO of Nissan Motor India and managing director and CEO of RNAIPL, who will return to Japan.        
	Kimura has been made corporate vice-president of the new vehicle production development division of Nissan.        
	Commenting on the changes, Colin Dodge, senior vice-president of Nissan, said, Our objective in India is to establish Nissan as one of the major players in the domestic market in the next few years as well as make it an export hub for global markets.        
	Nissan plans to roll out its first locally-manufactured passenger vehicle in India in mid-2010. The company has a plant in Chennai, which is 50:50 owned by Nissan and Renault.        
	At present, it only sells two completely built units here, sedan Teana and sports utility vehicle X-Trail.        
	The 400,000-unit manufacturing facility in Chennai was designed to equally support the business ventures of the two companies in India after third partner (but biggest stake holder) Mahindra amp; Mahindra walked out in early 2008.        
	Nissan and Renault have jointly invested Rs 800 crore in the project of the total targeted investment of Rs 4,500 crore.        
	However, because of a severe crunch in finances, the ramp-up in production in Chennai will be slow. Among other models, the company will produce its compact and fuel-efficient car the Micra from Chennai.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, June 15: Gas supplies from Reliance Industries KG Basin to power and fertiliser firms are unlikely to be affected by todays order of Bombay High Court.        
	Officials said the empowered group of ministers (eGoM) on the KG gas policy had stated that gas from the KG D-6 fields could be supplied to the proposed Dadri power plant being set up by the Anil Ambani group only when the plant was ready for production.         
	RNRL plans to set up a gas-based 7000MW power plant on the outskirts of New Delhi. The company expects to complete the plant in three to four years.        
	The eGoM had approved a price of $4.2 per mBtu (million British thermal unit) from the KG-D6 block. It had earlier stated that 14 mmscmd of the initial gas would go to fertiliser units.         
	Existing power plants would get 18mmscmd, including up to 8.5 mmscmd for the beleagured Dabhol power plant.         
	Reliance started pumping 2.5 mmscmd gas from the field in early April. It has agreed to sell 11 mmscmd to power companies and 15 mmscmd to fertiliser firms.        
	Some of the power firms to have signed an agreement are Gujarat Paguthan Energy Corporation, Konaseema Gas Power, Lanco Kondapalli Power, Maharashtra State Power Generation Company, Torrent Power Ltd Sugen, Torrent Power Ltd Vatva and Vemagiri Power Generation.        
	The eGoM had decided that RIL itself would be able to use the gas after the output increased beyond 40 mmscmd.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                               
	Mumbai, Aug. 4: ABG Shipyard today raised its open offer price for Great Offshore to Rs 520 per share.         
	It was only on July 30 that ABG had revised the offer price to Rs 450 per share from Rs 375 after increasing its holding in the target firm through market purchases.         
	ABG Shipyard is locked in a battle with Bharati Shipyard to gain control over Great Offshore. In a statement to stock exchanges today, ABG said it had acquired 1,50,000 shares of the target company constituting 0.4 per cent of its equity at an average price of Rs 498.39 per share. The highest price paid for acquiring some of the shares was Rs 519.94 apiece.         
	It acquired 80,000 shares on the BSE and 70,000 on the NSE.        
	The acquisition will take its holding in Great Offshore to a little under 9 per cent.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Buzz on Reliance, ONGC vying for British oil firm 
                                                                                                               Buzz on Reliance, ONGC vying for British oil firm 
                              Deal time                             
	London, June 21 (PTI): The countrys two largest companies  state-run ONGC and Mukesh Ambani-led Reliance Industries  are being rumoured as the mystery bidders for UK-based Addax Petroleum, which could be sold for 5 billion, a media report said here.        
	Chinas state-run Sinopec and Koreas National Oil Company are already believed to be in talks with Addax. The company has been approached by a third mystery bidder, possibly a national oil company from India, the Telegraph reported.        
	Some traders noted gossip that an Indian group may be involved in the auction. State-backed ONGC, which last year bought Imperial Energy for 1.4 billion, and Reliance were touted as potential Indian suitors, the report said.        
	London-based Addax Petroleum has fields in Iraqi Kurdistan and Nigeria and is said to be on the block for up to 5 billion (around $8.26 billion).        
	A formal offer for the company could be announced early next week, the Telegraph said, adding that there was also chatter that Jean Claude Gandur, the chief executive of Addax, and his bankers, led by Tim Chapman of RBC, are keen to get a deal done quickly.        
	Addax, which has one of the only two operational fields in Kurdistan, has seen interest from would-be buyers increase with the completion of an oil-export pipeline from the region.         
	Chinese state oil group Sinopec is believed to have tabled a 4.8-billion offer for Addax Petroleum, a move aimed at securing Chinas access to global oil reserves.

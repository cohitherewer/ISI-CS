The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Tax sops high on IT wish list 
                                                                                                               Tax sops high on IT wish list 
          JAYATI GHOSE                              
	New Delhi, June 20: The software industry has sought extension of tax sops and a simplified tax structure in this years budget.        
	The IT industrys growth rate fell to 16-17 per cent in 2008-09 from 30 per cent earlier because of the slowdown.        
	Infotech companies are hoping that finance minister Pranab Mukherjee will extend the tax holiday under the Software Technology Park of India (STPI) scheme. It is imperative that the government announces an extension of the fiscal benefits under the STPI scheme to mitigate the impact of the recession and protectionist measures being adopted globally, said Som Mittal, president of Nasscom.         
	Telecom minister A. Raja is also likely to push for the extension of STPI sops by another three years.         
	Companies are not taxed on revenues generated out of STPIs  a concession that brings down the effective tax rate to 12-15 per cent compared with the peak corporate tax of 33 per cent. The incentive is available till March 2010.         
	If the STPI tax benefits are not extended beyond 2010, these companies will end up paying around 33 per cent in taxes since they do not have the financial muscle to get into special economic zones (SEZs), said analysts.         
	Nasscom has suggested that the STPI scheme be tweaked to take into account the SEZ policy, under which the first five years offer a 100 per cent tax deduction and the next five, a 50 per cent waiver.         
	IT firms also want the government to do away with an anomaly that defines tax benefits in an SEZ on the basis of the total revenue of the assessee and not on the SEZ unit or entity.         
	This leads to companies not enjoying the full benefits of the policy.         
	Another key demand is to remove the multiplicity of taxes.         
	For instance, a software product is taxed as a product and as a service by different state governments.         
	Steps also need to be taken to ensure that India remains an attractive outsourcing destination.         
	The government should create a level-playing field for Indian firms vis-a-vis countries like Sri Lanka and the Philippines, where they do not pay any tax, said Raman Roy, chairman of Quatrro BPO.        
	The Philippines offers an eight-year tax holiday and imposes a 5 per cent tax on gross profits, apart from providing other benefits.        
	Opening up the education sector and allowing foreign investment in higher education will help develop a more skilled workforce. The government needs to provide stimulus to create new jobs, said S. Gopalkrishnan, CEO of Infosys Technologies.

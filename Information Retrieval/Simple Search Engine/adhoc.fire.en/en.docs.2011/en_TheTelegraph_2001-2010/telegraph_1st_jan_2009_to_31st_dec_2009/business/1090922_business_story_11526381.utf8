The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Savings deposits gain in popularity
                                                                                                               Savings deposits gain in popularity

	Mumbai, Sept. 21: Savings deposits with commercial banks, which offer a puny 3.5 per cent rate of interest, are set to cross the Rs 10-trillion-mark this fiscal, if they maintain the cracking growth pace of the last few years.        
	For the year ended March 31, 2009, savings deposits with banks stood at Rs 900,967 crore a jump of nearly 17 per cent over Rs 772,282 crore in 2007-08. If this growth rate stays, the deposits can be in the region of Rs 1054,131 crore, or a little more than Rs 10 trillion, by the end of this fiscal.         
	Savings deposits in the last fiscal as a percentage of GDP at current prices are around 17 per cent.        
	The deposits have some features that give them an edge over other financial instruments. According to Gaurav Mashruwala, a certified financial planner, they are not investment products.         
	An analyst added that this feature insulated them to an extent from changes in interest rates or the performance of other asset classes such as the stock markets.        
	While we all need a savings bank account, they are not opened by looking at the interest rates or returns, Mashruwala said.        
	The governments initiatives in financial inclusion are also behind the steady growth in the past four years of savings accounts. In 2005, the banks were asked to make available a basic no-frills account with low or minimum balances. As on March 31, 2009, the PSU banks had opened 2,98,59,178 such accounts, while their private rivals had opened 31,24,101 accounts.        
	As there is more inclusion, the first thing that is done is opening of an savings bank account. Therefore, their numbers should only go up in the future as more and more banks tap the rural markets, a banker said. He said the recent surge in stock market values was unlikely to make a major dent in savings accounts. Besides, money in savings accounts is very liquid as it can be withdrawn anytime, unlike a fixed or a term deposit.        
	Banks encourage such accounts as they provide a cheap source of funds, thereby improving their margins. Almost all banks are trying to raise the ratio of current and savings accounts to their total deposits.         
	More return        
	As of now, the interest computation on a savings deposit has been to the disadvantage of the depositor. The interest is paid on the minimum balance kept in the account between the tenth and the last date of every month.         
	In other words, if depositors had deposited and withdrawn large sums from their accounts before the tenth of a month, the money would not earn any interest though the bank would have used the money during the period of deposit.         
	The Reserve Bank of India has proposed to change this interest computation method from April next year.         
	The RBI wants banks to pay interest either on a daily balance basis or on the basis of a minimum monthly balance in the account from the first till the last day of the month. This will help savings account holders to earn more on their deposits.

	Calcutta/Mumbai, Dec. 10: The RBI will not immediately raise its rates to check liquidity but continue to chip away at the other measures it took to arrest the slowdown, feel bankers and analysts.        
	In a late night announcement yesterday, the central bank restored the ceiling on the interest rate on borrowings from overseas and disallowed the buyback of foreign currency convertible bonds.        
	The central banks approach of a gradual check on liquidity appears to have been motivated by two factors  the global and Indian financial markets are slowly returning to normalcy after the upheavals of a year ago; and food inflation in India, which has shot up to 19.05 per cent in the last week of November.        
	RBI deputy governor Shyamala Gopinath said in Calcutta today that the central bank had decided to bring back the ceiling on borrowings that were removed in January at the time of the global financial crisis. Credit spreads (cost of borrowing) overseas had gone up at that point of time so we had to relax the ceiling. But now it has narrowed down and the relaxation was allowed till December this year. So we have reverted to what was there prior to the relaxation, she said after a meeting of the banks central board.        
	Gopinath had on Wednesday sounded an alert on inflation. India is actively confronted by an upturn in inflation. On that backdrop, we really need to consider an exit from expansionary policy.         
	Rohini Malkani, an economist with Citi India, said the RBI would take measures other than its policy rate cuts such as a reduction in interest rates on NRI deposits, measures to encourage capital outflows and even a hike in the cash reserve ratio.        
	Capital inflows        
	Both Gopinath and RBI governor Duvvuri Subbarao denied that the restoration of the ceiling was a move to control capital inflows.        
	At this point of time capital flows are in line with our expectation and current account deficits. We cannot call it a capital surge like in 2006-08. However, if and when there are excess capital flows, we will respond to that, Subbarao said in Calcutta.        
	Bank of Baroda chief economist Rupa Rege Nitsure said yesterdays selective curbs on external commercial borrowing would benefit local banks. As it will make ECBs less attractive, the private corporate demand will migrate to local banks.        
	Subbarao said, While the demand for money is going up and corporations are coming back with their investment plans, they (corporations) are raising funds from other debt (including external commercial borrowings) and non-debt sources. We hope the credit growth in the banking sector will eventually come back.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Reliance free to sell fuel in local market
                                                                                                               Reliance free to sell fuel in local market
          OUR BUREAU AMP; AGENCIES                           Status change                                   
	Mumbai, April 16: The 33-million-tonne Jamnagar refinery of Reliance Industries has lost its export-oriented unit (EOU) status. This will allow the company to sell petrol and diesel in the domestic market.        
	This refinery, which was commissioned in July 1999 and is known as J-1, was converted into an EOU on April 16, 2007.        
	According to industry sources, Reliance was not keen on extending the EOU status of this refinery as it had commissioned another last December. The new refinery, which is adjacent to the old unit and known as J-2, is also export-oriented.        
	The company felt there was no need for two refineries catering to the overseas markets.         
	The end of the EOU status will also allow Reliance to sell fuels through its more than 1,400 petrol pumps that are now lying closed.         
	While Reliance can still export products from the J-1 refinery, it is believed that the company may sell diesel to public sector retailers such as Indian Oil, Bharat Petroleum and Hindustan Petroleum to meet the deficit expected in 2009-10.         
	Though the margins on petrol and diesel had turned positive with the fall in global oil prices since October, J-1 refinerys EOU status had barred it from selling fuel locally.         
	Reliance had sought the EOU status because of various advantages. It gave the company the benefit of duty-free import of crude and tax exemptions in exchange for exporting at least two-thirds of the products.

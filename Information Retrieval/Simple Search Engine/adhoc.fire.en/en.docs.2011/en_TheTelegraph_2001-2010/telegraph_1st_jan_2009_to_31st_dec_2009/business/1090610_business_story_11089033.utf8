The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | PM spending recipe for growth rebound
                                                                                                               PM spending recipe for growth rebound
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Singh: Optimistic                                  
	New Delhi, June 9: Indias economic growth may rebound to 8-9 per cent from an estimated 7 per cent in this fiscal, on the back of higher government spending amid a global recession.        
	Prime Minister Manmohan Singh told the Lok Sabha here today, This year we will maintain at least 7 per cent growth rate. In the short term you cant do better.         
	After growing 9 per cent between 2005 and 2008, the economy expanded 6.7 per cent in the last fiscal because of the recession.        
	The economy is expected to grow at about the same rate this year, with higher infrastructure spending creating new jobs and improving consumer confidence.         
	We cant spend our way to prosperity, but there is considerable scope to increase public expenditure, particularly in infrastructure projects, the Prime Minster said.         
	The Congress-led government is committed to allocate more money to infrastructure and flagship social schemes such as the rural job guarantee project in the budget slated to be tabled in the first week of next month.         
	Since our savings rate is as high as 35 per cent, we can achieve a growth rate of 8-9 per cent even if the world economy does not do well, Singh said.        
	The bourses warmed up to the Prime Ministers speech with the sensex jumping 461 points, or 3.14 per cent, to end at 15127.        
	We have the manoeuvrability to increase public expenditure, the Prime Minister said alluding to the low inflation rate.         
	With inflation under control at below 1 per cent for several weeks now, the finance ministry feels higher spending and a fiscal deficit of up to 5.5 per cent can spur growth without taxing the poor too much with higher prices.        
	Singh, however, admitted that the fiscal system was under stress.         
	Fiscal deficit more than doubled to 6.2 per cent of the gross domestic product in the last financial year as the government waived Rs 71,000 crore in farm loans, cut excise duties, awarded civil servants with higher salaries and increased spending on infrastructure projects to create more jobs.

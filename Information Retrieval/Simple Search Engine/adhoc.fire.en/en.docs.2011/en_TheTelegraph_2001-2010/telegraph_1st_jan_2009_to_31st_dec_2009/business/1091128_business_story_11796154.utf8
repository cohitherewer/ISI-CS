          OUR BUREAU                                            
	Mumbai/New Delhi, Nov. 27: The impact of Dubai Worlds debt restructuring woes on Indias corporate houses and banks is likely to be mimimal.         
	Larsen amp; Toubro, which has an exposure in the region, said the situation would not affect the company in any significant way. Global brokerage CLSAs analyst said, Most corporate exposures are minimal in nature and unlikely to be meaningful in the overall scheme of things. While collateral damage to stock prices are likely, we believe the Indian growth story is resilient.        
	However, exporters of farm products feel India is not completely immune to the financial concerns in Dubai and there can be a marginal impact on trade. India is a major exporter of basmati rice, onion, spices such as chilli, cardamom, cumin and ginger, and wheat flour to Dubai.         
	Sabyasachi Ray, executive director of the Gem amp; Jewellery Export Promotion Council, said: Dubai is the number one export destination for the sector. However, the goods are not consumed there, so exports may not be affected as it is more of a transit point.        
	If the crisis spreads to banks, exports will be affected as the money is routed through them and Indian banks will not honour their letters of credit, Ajay Sahai, director-general of Fieo, said.        
	Tea Board member Kapil Kapoor said, Export of tea will be affected if the banking system collapses as most of the exports to Iran and the UAE go through Dubai.         
	There is also some uncertainty surrounding promised investments from the UAE.        
	Private equity fund Istithmars may unwind its positions in SpiceJet  where it has a 13 per cent stake  but it is unlikely that the fund will look towards raising cash for an investment of a little over Rs 100 crore immediately when it can raise funds from selling bigger assets overseas.         
	SpiceJets Ajay Singh declined comment.         
	Emaar-MGF  a joint venture in which the Dubai-based Emaar Properties has a 41 per cent stake  has a land bank of 13,000 acres in India.        
	Emaar MGF has operations only in India and the developments in Dubai have no impact on it. Our business and funding plans are on track, the company said.                                 
	The recently announced plans in respect of debt of Dubai World has no impact on Emaar Properties PJSC financial position or operations or its ability to meet any obligations. Emaar has a strong balance sheet of $17 billion and in comparison has a very low debt obligation, the company said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Haldia port plan in trouble 
                                                                                                               Haldia port plan in trouble 
          SAMBIT SAHA                          In choppy waters                                  
	Calcutta, Feb. 20: Calcutta Port Trusts (CPT) plan to upgrade infrastructure at the Haldia port with modern cargo handling equipment has run into rough weather.        
	Senior port officials have strongly contested the contract which they say would cost the port Rs 50-60 crore of income over the next 10 years.        
	ABG Infralogistics and ABG Calcutta Container have won the deal to put up mobile harbour cranes on berth 2 and 8 at Haldia. The other contenders were Sical Logistics and Tata Steel subsidiary TMIL.        
	The Rs 600-crore deal is the largest ever revenue contract to be approved by the CPT board of trustees, the highest governing body of the trust.         
	An agenda circulated to the trustees mentions that the meeting on February 23 will discuss the award of contract. This is despite the fact that the finance department has raised objections to the deal.        
	Under the contract, the private contractor will make an investment to put up the cranes. In return, the port will pay a certain amount to the private party for the cargo it handles. The port will pay this amount from the user charge it collects from customers. As the port has hardly any investment in putting up the cranes, the user charge it can collect will be enough only to pay the private party, leaving little or nothing for the port. The contract will be valid for 10 years from the day a letter of intent is issued by the port.         
	However, the contract could have been structured the way neighbouring Paradip port did. Under the arrangement there, the private party puts up the crane, collects user charges from customers and shares a part of the profit with the port.         
	Incidentally, the CPT had followed the royalty model when it handed over berth 4A and 12 to two private parties on BOT (build, operate and transfer) basis.        
	The contract, which is being pushed forward at the behest of a top port functionary, will have no room for earning royalty. We are baffled why the contract is being rushed through despite the fact that the port will loose significant amount of money, a senior official said.

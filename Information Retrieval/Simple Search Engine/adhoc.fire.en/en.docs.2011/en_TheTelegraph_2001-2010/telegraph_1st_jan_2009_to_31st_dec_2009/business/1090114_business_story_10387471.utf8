The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Satyams loss is gain for TCS
                                                                                                               Satyams loss is gain for TCS
          OUR BUREAU                              
	New Delhi, Jan. 13: In a delayed disclosure, the World Bank said it had awarded Tata Consultancy Services a chunk of the projects that were earlier given to Satyam Computer.        
	The bank had barred Satyam from doing business with it for eight years beginning September 2008, months before the Rs 7,800-crore accounting fraud was revealed.        
	The projects were awarded to TCS the same month through competitive bidding  an indication that the bank is not specifically targeting Indian IT companies. On the BSE, the TCS scrip closed at Rs 522.80, up nearly 3 per cent from yesterdays close.        
	Hours after World Bank made public that Wipro had been debarred from doing any business with the global lender, chairman Azim Premji wrote to his employees that the company had not done anything unethical.         
	Premji said, Let me reaffirm that Wipro was right from a legal as well as ethical standpoint. We believe what we did what was right and we did it in the right manner.         
	Delhi-based Nestor Pharmaceuticals also hit out at the World Bank saying the firm would have taken the institution to court but for the immunity enjoyed by it. Nestor, too, was barred.

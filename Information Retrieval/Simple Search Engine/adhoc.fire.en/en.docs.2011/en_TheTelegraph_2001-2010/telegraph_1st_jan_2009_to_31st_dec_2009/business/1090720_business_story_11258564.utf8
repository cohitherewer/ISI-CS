          SAUMITRA DASGUPTA                      HEART OF  THE MATTER 				       Who owns the  gas anyway?      Under Article 297 of the  Constitution, the Union of  India owns petroleum  occurring in its natural  state in the territorial  waters and the continental  shelf of India      Contentious issues:      Govt claims RIL is only a  contractor and doesn rsquo;t own  the gas that it commercially  exploits      The production sharing  contract between the govt  and RIL provides for  recovery of all costs before  sharing lsquo;profit petroleum rsquo;      Anil Ambani side claims RIL rsquo;s  share of profit petroleum  belongs to the Mukesh  Ambani company. Govt  has nothing to do with how  RIL rsquo;s share is sold  and to whom after it has  received all its dues      Change of strategy:      Govt move to declare the  MoU between Ambani  brothers as null and void  potentially undermines all  the arguments in the high  court till date      Govt wants to become a  party to the case; in the  high court it was only an  intervener with a limited role      Two verdicts ndash; one by the  company judge and the  other by the division bench  of the high court ndash; have  gone in Anil Ambani rsquo;s  favour. Neither denies  RNRL the right to the  gas from KG-D6.      Potential fallout:      Other private players such as  Cairn Energy may be  subjected to the same  conditions when oil starts  flowing from the Rajasthan  fields later this year      Supreme Court decision on  the ownership of gas could  have a bearing on the  auction of oil and gas blocks  in the eighth round of bidding  that is imminent                                
	Mumbai, July 19: The government has created a potentially piquant situation by demanding that the Supreme Court declare the memorandum of understanding (MoU) reached between the Ambani brothers in 2005 as null and void.        
	If the apex court accepts the demand, the demerger of the Reliance group itself could be called into question because the MoU was the bedrock agreement on the basis of which Dhirubhai Ambanis empire was formally carved up in January 2006.         
	It could also spark another ferocious bout of litigation between the Ambani brothers who are honour bound not to invade each others territories or lines of business for at least 10 years.         
	The MoU is a private document within the Ambani family and was reached on June 18, 2005, when matriarch Kokilaben Ambani intervened to thrash out a settlement between the warring siblings.         
	The document was not produced in October 2005 when Reliance Industries sought Bombay High Courts approval for the scheme of arrangement that had been devised to split the Reliance group.        
	Back in June, the division bench of the high court said: The memorandum of understanding between the two brothers  was an integral part of the scheme (of arrangement).        
	Earlier, in his verdict delivered in October 2007, company judge Anoop Mohta noted: Based on the MoU, both the brothers and the officials of RIL and other group companies  exchanged correspondence, e-mails and held conferences and meetings to implement the MoU and to resolve the disputes by moving a scheme of arrangement. Accordingly, RIL and other companies decided to move Bombay High Court for the sanction of the scheme of demerger.        
	Although the MoU wasnt produced in court, the correspondence between the two sides were part of the court records and the provisions of MoU had been worked into the scheme of arrangement.        
	When the court approved the scheme of arrangement in December 2005, it was clearly on the basis of the MoU and the depositions made under it. The demerger had also been cleared by the ministry of corporate affairs.        
	Portions of the MoU  especially those provisions that pertained to the understanding on gas supply from the Krishna-Godavari basin  were eventually produced before a division bench of Bombay High Court late last year.        
	To negate the MoU now would amount to a negation of the demerger itself, creating a climate of uncertainty for the two groups led by Mukesh and Anil Ambani and their large body of shareholders.        
	More importantly, neither of the Ambani brothers has repudiated the MoU till date.         
	Legal quibble        
	The only quibble is whether the terms of an agreement between the two brothers will extend to the boards and managements of listed companies that have no access to the private document and are not apparently aware of its full contents.        
	This is the line of argument that the Mukesh Ambani side has consistently taken. RIL has also relied on a large body of case law to argue that since RNRL isnt a party to the MoU, it could not try and seek comfort from it.         
	Relying on a number of verdicts in similar cases in the past, RIL also argued that RNRL hadnt changed its articles of association to incorporate the terms and conditions that were spelt out in the MoU.         
	Govt strategy        
	It is important to understand why the government wants the apex court to declare the MoU as null and void.         
	First and foremost, the two major verdicts in this case  the first by the company judge of Bombay High Court in October 2007 and the second by the division bench of the same court in June this year  have upheld the fact that the MoU has a binding effect on both companies  RIL and RNRL  after the scheme of demerger was sanctioned in December 2005.        
	If it can nix the MoU itself, the government can persuade the court to uphold its right to decide who should receive gas supplies and at what price.        
	The ploy seems to be to deny RNRL any gas  and this is clearly evident from the tenor of the governments affidavit filed on Friday which said the top priority would be to meet the requirements of the fertiliser plants and then the existing power producers along with a few LPG producers.        
	Since the Anil Ambani group doesnt have a power project in place to receive the gas, why should its claim be entertained at all?        
	The Anil Ambani camp has argued that without an assured supply of gas at a viable price, nobody would be ready to provide funds for the Rs 20,000-crore power project at Dadri in Uttar Pradesh.        
	The government is certainly playing hardball. It wants the Supreme Court to allow it to become a party to the case. Remember, that it had tried to become a party to the case before Bombay High Court as well. At one stage, both the Ambani camps had opposed the governments locus standi in the case.        
	The high court only agreed to take the government on board as an intervener to clarify issues relating to the production sharing contract between the government and RIL with respect to the KG-D6 gas field.        
	By seeking to broaden its role as a respondent in the case before the Supreme Court, the government is asserting its right to play a more dominant role in this case than the courts have allowed it so far. The Supreme Court will have to deal with extremely tortuous arguments when it starts hearing the case on Monday.

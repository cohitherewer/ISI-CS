          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Sharma: Sowing hope                                  
	New Delhi, Nov. 17: India is planning to import rice to shore up supplies and is negotiating price and quantities with Thailand and Vietnam.         
	An empowered group of ministers will meet on Friday to decide on the issue, commerce minister Anand Sharma said today.        
	We are exploring the option of government-to-government deals with Thailand and Vietnam. Talks have started and prices will be negotiated, he told reporters on the sidelines of a meeting of state industry ministers.        
	Officials said this was not the first time that the country would be importing rice. The country has been importing in small quantities but has traditionally been an exporter.        
	The government will decide on the quantity later this week. However, this would not make India a net importer.         
	Officials said the government was planning to shore up supplies to meet any adverse situation  drought or excess rainfall  next year and to stop domestic food prices from pushing up the inflation rate.         
	Sharma said the country had sufficient stocks of foodgrains. On October 1, the Centre had a buffer stock of 28.4mt of wheat against a norm of 11mt. It has a rice buffer stock of 14.5mt, far above the norm of 5.2mt.        
	Farm expert Y.K. Alagh said, The government could be going in for import to meet the requirements in June next. But that is not the right strategy. The country would be importing at a high price and selling at a subsidised rate here. It is bad economics that a poor country like ours is subsidising the farmers of rich countries.         
	India is the worlds second-largest rice producer, but this years crop is expected to be far below the bumper harvests of the two previous years. Production in the kharif season is estimated to fall sharply to 69.45mt from 84.58mt in the last season.

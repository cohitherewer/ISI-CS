          OUR CORRESPONDENT                          Heavy industries minister Vilasrao Deshmukh (left) with Bajaj Group chairman Rahul Bajaj (centre) in New Delhi on Thursday. (PTI)                                  
	New Delhi, Sept. 3: The government is working on a scheme to facilitate funds for the auto component industry, hit by global recession.        
	My ministry is examining the feasibility of having a separate scheme, which can facilitate financing to the sector, heavy industries minister Vilasrao Deshmukh said at the annual conference of the Automotive Component Manufacturers Association of India (Acma) here today.        
	Component firms  comprising mainly small and medium units  are finding it tough to raise funds.        
	Deshmukh asked the manufacturers to use the measures announced in the foreign trade policy that had been prepared to meet the objectives of Automotive Mission Plan 2006-15. The plan aims at a turnover of $145 billion for the automotive sector by 2016 that will double its contribution to the gross domestic product. It is focussed on the export of small cars, multi-utility vehicles, two-wheelers and auto parts.         
	The industry was less affected by recession than its global peers, but the export of auto parts remained a concern. This sector is facing stiff competition not only in the domestic market but also in exports from other low-cost countries, he said.        
	Deshmukh emphasised investments in more efficient machines, upgradation of workers skills and the adoption of the latest manufacturing processes.        
	On its part, Deshmukhs ministry is trying to facilitate a greater collaboration between Indian and foreign entities in research and development.        
	In 2008-09, exports grew 6 per cent compared with a compound annual growth rate of about 25 per cent for 2003-07.        
	The automotive and the auto component industries had posted a growth of 3 per cent and 6 per cent, respectively, in the last fiscal.

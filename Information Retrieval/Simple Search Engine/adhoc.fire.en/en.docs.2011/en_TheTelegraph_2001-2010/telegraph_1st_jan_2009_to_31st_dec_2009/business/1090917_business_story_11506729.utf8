          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          TALE TWIST                                  
	Mumbai, Sept. 16: Bharati Shipyard, which is locked in a battle with ABG Shipyard to acquire Great Offshore  today increased its stake in the latter when it bought over 11 lakh shares of the offshore oil services provider.        
	Bharati bought the shares in bulk deals on both the Bombay Stock Exchange and the National Stock Exchange.        
	Videocon Industries was one of the sellers.        
	Videocon sold over 2.23 lakh shares of Great Offshore to Dhanashree Properties Pvt Ltd  a subsidiary of Bharati  at Rs 556.66 per share. On the BSE, Dhanashree Properties acquired 7.56 lakh shares at Rs 558.80 apiece. It also bought 3.60 lakh shares on the NSE at Rs 558.82 per share.        
	The purchase of these shares, which constitute nearly 3 per cent of Great Offshore equity, increases Bharatis holding in the company to around 24 per cent. ABG owns around 11 per cent.        
	Both the companies have announced open offers for Great Offshore. While Bharati has offered Rs 405 a share, ABG Shipyard has proposed a price of Rs 520 apiece. After the latest stake purchase, Bharati will have to revise its open offer price to at least Rs 558.80 per share.        
	The battle for Great Offshore began when Vijay Sheth, the former vice-chairman and managing director of the company, asked Bharati Shipyard for a loan of Rs 240 crore to repay the amount owed to two financial institutions. In exchange, he had pledged a 14.89 per cent stake in Great Offshore. Sheth was unable to repay the loan and Bharati decided in May to invoke the pledge and acquired the shares at Rs 315 apiece.

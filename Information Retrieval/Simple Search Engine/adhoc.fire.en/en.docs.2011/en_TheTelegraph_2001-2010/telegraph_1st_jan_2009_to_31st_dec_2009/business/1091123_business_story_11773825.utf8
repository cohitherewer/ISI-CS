                              Recovery track                            
	New Delhi, Nov. 22 (PTI): Ten manufacturing segments, including industrial gases and multi-utility vehicles, grew over 20 per cent in the first half of the fiscal, leading recovery in the sector, a CII-Ascon survey said.        
	Of the 100 manufacturing segments surveyed, 10 recorded excellent growth rate during April-September 2009-10 over the year-ago period, while 26 showed high growth rate of 10-20 per cent.        
	The 26 high-growth segments include aluminium, cement, fertiliser, light commercial vehicles and consumer durables.         
	Others reporting excellent growth are nitrogen, earth moving and construction equipment and motor starters.        
	Besides, 37 segments, including crude oil, plastics, refinery, power cables, synthetics, oil and gas equipment, registered moderate growth of 0-10 per cent.        
	However, polymers, sponge iron, switch gears, ball bearings, electric motors and power transformers continued to report negative growth.        
	Manufacturing output was up 9.3 per cent in September against 6.2 per cent in the corresponding month last year.         
	The report stated that the country should leverage its strengths in IT and automotive industries to graduate into design, development and manufacturing in the aerospace and defence sector.        
	Small and medium enterprises (SMEs) should focus on innovation, building intellectual property and adopting quality and process standards to be able to offer complete sub-systems or assemblies, the study said.        
	The licensing procedure for defence manufacturing should be streamlined to encourage the entry of SMEs.        
	Last week, the CII had said the countrys economic growth was likely to exceed 6 per cent this fiscal as demand was picking up across sectors and the economy was getting back on track.

	Mumbai, Jan. 15: Lazard Asset Management, which holds around 7 per cent in Satyam Computer Services, today offloaded around 5 per cent of the troubled IT services company.        
	Lazard sold over 1.13 crore shares of Satyam on the Bombay Stock Exchange in a bulk deal at a price of Rs 21.71 per share. On the National Stock Exchange, it sold 2.44 crore shares each at Rs 21.74. Market circles say Lazards stake has fallen to around 2 per cent after the sale.        
	As of September 30, 2008, Lazard held nearly 1.45 crore shares of Satyam that translated into a stake of 2.15 per cent. However, over the past few days, it has been buying into the stock.        
	Key FIIs such as Aberdeen, Fidelity and Swiss Finance Corporation had sold large number of Satyam shares.Market circles say that among them, Swiss Finance Corporation again bought shares of the company after the appointment of three new board members. However, today, it sold close to 1.08 crore shares at Rs 21.36 and Rs 21.58 per share at the NSE and BSE, respectively.        
	It is believed that the LIC and ICICI Prudential Life Insurance are among the few institutions that hold some shares of Satyam. In addition, L amp;T holds around 4 per cent.

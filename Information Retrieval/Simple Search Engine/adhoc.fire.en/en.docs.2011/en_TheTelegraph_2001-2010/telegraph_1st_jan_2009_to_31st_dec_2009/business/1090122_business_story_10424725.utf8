The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Wipro net up 17%
                                                                                                               Wipro net up 17%
          OUR BUREAU AND AGENCIES                          Azim Premji in Bangalore on Wednesday. (PTI)                                   
	Calcutta, Jan. 21: Wipro today reported a 17.55 per cent rise in consolidated net profit at Rs 1,003.9 crore for the third quarter ended December 31, 2008, against Rs 854 crore in the year-ago period.         
	However, the countrys third-largest software exporter has lowered its fourth-quarter outlook because of a demand for lower prices by its western clients. Wipro shares closed down 3.55 per cent at Rs 219.75 on the BSE today.        
	Wipro expects its revenue from IT services, including its earnings from the acquisition of Citi Technology Services, to total $1.05 billion in the current quarter, down 7 per cent from the previous quarter.        
	We are living in tough times, the macro-economic challenges are significant and are affecting businesses across segments, Wipro chairman Azim Premji said.         
	The guidance indicates a weak demand scenario, said Tarun Sisodia, research head at Anand Rathi Securities.         
	We are not very positive on this result, he said.         
	Wipro chief financial officer Suresh Senapaty said some of its clients were demanding a price cut because of the global economic downturn and this could affect margins. The pressure was there in the third quarter and some of that will continue to be there in the fourth quarter, he said.         
	Wipro  which counts Citigroup, Credit Suisse and Cisco among its clients  has added a few clients, including Origin Energy of Australia, during the reporting quarter.         
	The companys total income increased to Rs 6,773 crore during the quarter under review from Rs 5,433.2 crore a year ago.        
	Profit margins were impacted by about 50 basis points after it wrote off a payment due from Nortel Networks, Senapaty said. Wipro had earlier said Nortel, which had filed for bankruptcy protection last week, contributed less than 1.5 per cent to its IT revenue and expected to continue a major portion of its business with it.        
	During the quarter ended March 31, 2008, Wipro Infrastructure Engineering, Quantech Global Services, Wipro Healthcare, mPower Software, MPact Technology Service and cMango India were merged with Wipro with retrospective effect from April 1, 2007.        
	Satyam clients        
	Wipro co-chief executive officer Suresh Vaswani said the company was neither in the race for Satyam nor for the clients of the scam-stained firm.

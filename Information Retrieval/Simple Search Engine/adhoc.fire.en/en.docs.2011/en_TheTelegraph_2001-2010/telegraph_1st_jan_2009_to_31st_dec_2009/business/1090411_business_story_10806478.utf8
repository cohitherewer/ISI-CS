The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | More Fortune hotels on ITC menu
                                                                                                               More Fortune hotels on ITC menu
          OUR BUREAU                              
	New Delhi, April 10: Fortune Hotels Private Limited, a wholly owned subsidiary of ITC Limited, is planning to have 100 hotels with an inventory of around 8,000 rooms by 2012.        
	Our plan is to have 100 hotels under the Fortune brand across the country by 2012 with an inventory of around 8,000 rooms, Pawan Verma, senior executive vice-president (hotels division) of ITC, said on the sidelines of the inauguration of the Fortune Inn Grazia hotel in Noida.        
	Fortune Hotels, which specialises in contract hotel management, is also looking at having company-owned properties and plans to build two such hotels in Bangalore and Coimbatore in the next two years. At present, the company has 26 hotels with around 2,300 rooms.        
	In addition, 26 properties are under various phases of development and will be ready by mid-2011. This would give us an inventory of 4,300 rooms and a presence in 40 cities, Verma said.        
	Fortune was looking at domestic customers and the leisure segment to push growth.         
	Leisure travellers comprise around 15-20 per cent of our customers, while the ratio between foreign and domestic customers is 75:25. We are now planning to put more emphasis on attracting domestic visitors in the leisure segment, Verma said.        
	On the impact of the current economic slowdown, he said, Fortune is basically a business segment chain. We have in fact benefited as the downturn has meant more occupancy is shifting from premium category to chains like ours.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Prompt RBI takes care of cash need

	Mumbai, Sept. 14: The Reserve Bank of India pumped Rs 5,61,700 crore  about 7 per cent of Indias GDP  into the financial system through a cocktail of monetary and credit disbursal measures to keep the juggernaut going after the Lehman debacle last year.        
	Bankers and economists reckon the central banks quick response to the crisis ensured that the cash trough didnt run dry when foreign investors started pulling their cash out of Indian markets and the foreign borrowing windows had almost been slammed shut.        
	We dealt with the crisis from a position of strength, says Rupa Rege Nitsure, chief economist at Bank of Baroda. The primary credit for this goes to the government and the RBI.        
	Reserve Bank governor Duvvuri Subbarao had three clear objectives: maintain adequate rupee liquidity, ensure that there was enough dollars and euros in the kitty to meet demand from importers, and buttress a policy framework that would keep shovelling credit to all classes of borrowers.        
	The central bank had to use conventional and innovative measures to deal with the situation.         
	Using conventional tools, the RBI slashed policy interest rates aggressively and relaxed rules that made it mandatory for banks to park a certain portion of their deposits with the apex bank. It also liberalised refinance facilities for export credit.        
	The non-conventional measures taken by the central bank was to expand the lendable resources to apex finance institutions to refinance credit provided to small industries, the housing sector and exporters. It also opened a refinance window to support non-banking finance companies.        
	Bankers agreed that these measures had staved off the crisis.        
	D.K. Joshi, principal economist at Crisil, says the decision to remain conservative in opening up the financial sector has paid off. Nitsure agreed that the tight regulation of the financial sector safeguarded the financial system. Neither Joshi nor Nitsure is certain whether the global crisis has blown over.         
	Joshi says the overseas demand for products is still shrinking. The export-oriented industries might feel the impact of this though its intensity might not be same as it was after the Lehman bankruptcy.        
	Nitsure adds that it will take around three years for the world economy to return to complete stability.

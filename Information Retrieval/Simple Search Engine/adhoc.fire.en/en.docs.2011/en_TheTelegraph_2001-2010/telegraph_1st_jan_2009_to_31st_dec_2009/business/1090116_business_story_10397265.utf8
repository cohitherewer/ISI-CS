	New Delhi, Jan. 15: The government has asked state-run banks to continue giving loans to both Satyam and Maytas Infrastructure.        
	Maytas, which is believed to have considerable political and bureaucratic clout, has bagged many projects from different states.         
	These include three dam projects in Orissa worth Rs 167 crore, projects under the Narmada canal plan in Gujarat estimated at Rs 212 crore and other irrigation projects worth over Rs 280 crore.        
	The Andhra Pradesh government has assigned the company to build the Hyderabad metro, Machilipatnam port and some irrigation projects for Rs 13,000 crore.         
	It has been in touch with the Centre to ensure the continuity of the Maytas projects. The Centre, too, wants Maytas to stay afloat.         
	According to finance ministry officials, the government is not keen on providing direct funds to Satyam. Interim CEO Ram Mynampati has claimed that the company needs Rs 150 crore to meet insurance liabilities of its US employees.         
	The IT major needs bank funding for its daily operations. It has enough receivables from work orders for the long term, the officials said.         
	Deepak Parekh, the government appointed member to the board of Satyam, today said that the company had receivables of Rs 1,700 crore. Parekh today met company affairs minister P.C. Gupta.        
	The SBI said it was ready to offer loans to Satyam since it had a good reputation among clients and possessed technical competence. Other state-run banks such as the Bank of Baroda may also be willing to lend.         
	NHB move        
	The National Housing Bank (NHB) today said it was collecting information from housing finance companies about their exposures in Satyam group firms .

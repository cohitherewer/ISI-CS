The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Tatas seek Reliance gas for power plant
                                                                                                               Tatas seek Reliance gas for power plant
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                    
	Mumbai, July 13: The Tatas are seeking access to gas supplies from Reliance Industries field in the Krishna-Godavari basin  which adds a twist to a rivetting corporate battle between the Ambani brothers just a week before the Supreme Court starts hearing arguments from the two sides.        
	Tata Power wants gas for its 150MW power plant at Trombay but hasnt been able to convince the government to put its name on a long list of projects that will be able to get assured supplies from RILs gasfields.        
	However, the power ministry wants Tata Power to put in place a combined cycle gas turbine (CCGT) before it approves gas supplies from the KG basin. In a CCGT plant, a gas turbine generates electricity and the waste heat is used to make steam to generate additional electricity through a steam turbine, thereby enhancing the efficiency of power generation. It also reduces gas requirement.        
	A Tata Power spokesperson refused to comment on the latest development.         
	Tata Powers contention is that supply of gas to Trombay will ease the power crisis in Mumbai. It has asked the power ministry for 1 million standard cubic metres of gas a day from the KG basin to run the fourth unit at Trombay, which currently runs on liquid fuel.         
	The Tatas want to pick up the unutilised portion of the gas that has already been allocated to other power plants. The fourth unit at Trombay was shut down to meet emission norms. Tata Power is looking for a cheaper fuel option like gas.         
	RIL refused to comment on the issue.        
	The Trombay unit does not figure on the list of gas supply purchase agreements that were signed by RIL with 35 users from the power industry on the basis of recommendations by the government.         
	The power ministry believes that gas allocation to the Trombay unit will amount to inefficient use of gas, as the thermal efficiency of the old unit is likely to be just 35 per cent compared with 50 per cent of a new CCGT.

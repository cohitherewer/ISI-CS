	Aurobindo said the acquisition gave it an opportunity to enter the high-growth injectables space and enhance capabilities to provide comprehensive pharma manufacturing, distribution, services and solutions to its clients.        
	A timely and cost-effective acquisition, synergies with Aurobindo Pharmas existing operations in sourcing, regulatory, marketing aspects and meeting requirements of large pharma clients, including the global alliances are some of the key aspects considered, the company said.        
	Aurobindo had appointed two independent financial advisers  KPMG India and Motilal Oswal Investment Advisors  to analyse the value of Tridents business. R.B. Shah and Associates assessed the replacement value of its assets.         
	The proposed facility of Trident will specialise in the manufacturing of a general injectable range of formulation products, including glass vials.        
	Aurobindo said 75 per cent of the facility had been completed and it would start operations in April 2011.        
	One of the largest active pharmaceutical ingredients manufacturer in Asia, Aurobindo also makes formulations in the cardio-vascular, central nervous system, gastroenterologicals, anti-retrovirals and anti-infectives segments.

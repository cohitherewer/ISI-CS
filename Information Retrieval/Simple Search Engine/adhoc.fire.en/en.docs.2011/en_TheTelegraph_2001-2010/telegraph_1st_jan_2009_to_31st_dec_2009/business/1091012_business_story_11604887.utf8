The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | ICICI gives provident fund top return
                                                                                                               ICICI gives provident fund top return
                                          
	New Delhi, Oct. 11 (PTI): ICICI Prudential has retained the top position among the fund managers of the Employees Provident Fund Organisation (EPFO). It gave an 8.77 per cent return during the one-year period ending September 2009.         
	Asset management entities  HSBC AMC, SBI AMC and Reliance Capital AMC  followed ICICI Pru in that order, rating agency Crisil said in its performance analysis for the EPFO.         
	HSBC AMC and the State Bank of India offered 8.74 and 8.73 per cent returns, respectively, during the one-year period. Reliance Capital AMC gave a return of 8.65 per cent.         
	Earlier, ICICI had emerged as the top earner, giving an 8.73 per cent return during the nine-month period ended June 30. The SBI was at the second spot with an 8.70 per cent return. HSBC and Reliance AMC had ranked third and fourth, having recorded investment yields of 8.67 and 8.52 per cent, respectively.        
	The EPFO had appointed the four fund managers in July 2008 to manage its funds with an idea of improving returns. A major chunk of its funds are invested in government schemes and securities having yields of less than 8 per cent.        
	The EPFO manages provident fund deposits of about 4.5 crore subscribers with a corpus of around 2.57 lakh crore. Its incremental deposits every year is around Rs 25,000 crore. It has appointed Crisil for evaluating the performance of the fund managers.        
	The EPFO is maintaining an interest rate of 8.5 per cent for depositors since 2005-06 because of low return on government securities, schemes and instruments.         
	The rate was 9.5 per cent for three consecutive fiscals from 2002 to 2005. It gave 11 per cent and 11.25 per cent interest on PF deposits in 2000-01 and 2001-02, respectively. It maintained an interest rate as high as 12 per cent for 10 years during 1989-90 to 1999-2000.        
	Considering the deposit rates of various banks which are below 7 per cent for a period of one year, the performance of the four fund managers is good. They earned returns of over 8 per cent on invested EPFO funds given to them, secretary of Hind Mazdoor Sabha, A.D. Nagpal, said.        
	Though the returns are better than bank deposit rates, these should be in double digits, said Nagpal, who is also also member of the Central Board of Trustees.

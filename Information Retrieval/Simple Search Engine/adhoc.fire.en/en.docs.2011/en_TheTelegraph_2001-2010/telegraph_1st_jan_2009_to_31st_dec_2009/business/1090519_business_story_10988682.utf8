The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Car makers clamour for excise rejig
                                                                                                               Car makers clamour for excise rejig
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                          WHEEL POWER                                  
	New Delhi, May 18: The auto industry wants the new government to narrow the gap in excise duty on small and large cars.        
	The government should look into the large differences in excise duty on different sizes of vehicles. We expect the UPA government to remove the additional levy of Rs 15,000-20,000 on cars having engines above 1500cc and on multi-utility vehicles. Excise duty on these cars should be brought down to the Cenvat level, said P. Balendran, vice-president of General Motors.        
	Besides the additional levy, these vehicles attract a 20 per cent excise duty.        
	Car makers want the new government to continue its support to the industry.         
	Shinzo Nakanishi, managing director of Maruti Suzuki India, said, I am sure the new government will reinforce its initiatives to promote the auto industry as a key economic driver.        
	However, industry is wary that the sops given as part of the stimulus packages may be withdrawn.         
	Riding on these sops, domestic passenger car sales for fiscal 2008-09 rose 1.31 per cent to 12,19,473 units from 12,03,733 units in the previous fiscal.         
	There should be no reversal of financial stimulus packages announced over the last six months, said Pawan Goenka, president (automotive sector) of Mahindra amp; Mahindra.        
	The relief packages, which reduced Cenvat by four per cent, allowed manufacturers to reduce the prices. The government also gave a boost to commercial vehicles by encouraging states to upgrade their buses under the Jawaharlal Nehru National Urban Renewal Mission scheme.

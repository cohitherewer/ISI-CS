        The Reserve Bank has proposed to change the rules for crediting interest to a savings bank account. Srikumar Bondyopadhyay tells you how to manage your account                                            
	The first step in planning your personal finance is to chalk out your savings strategy. Your savings bank account, from where you make all kinds of payments, is the first place from where you should begin your money management.         
	However, the interest earned on a savings bank account and its income tax implications are not very favourable for depositors.         
	Low interest        
	At present, interest on a savings bank deposit is calculated at the rate of 3.5 per cent annually on the minimum balance in the account between the tenth and the last day of each calendar month and credited to the account on a quarterly basis.         
	Thus, if you deposit, say Rs 1,00,000, on July 11 and withdraw the amount on August 31, the money will earn no interest though it remained in the account and the bank used it for 51 days.        
	In contrast, if you deposit Rs 1,00,000 on February 10 and withdraw it on March 1, it will earn interest for a month though the money remained in the account for 19 days  an effective yield of 5.603 per cent.        
	However, these are two extreme cases, given the calendar months we have considered.        
	On an average, the interest yield in a savings bank works out to a meagre 2.8 per cent, according to the Banking Codes and Standards Board of India. The average interest yield on savings bank deposits is, thus, much lower than the declared interest rate of 3.5 per cent.         
	Tax axe        
	Besides, interests earned on savings bank deposits are taxable, depending on the depositors income and the corresponding tax rate.         
	In contrast, high yielding assets such as equity, mutual funds, and even long-term bank deposits enjoy some form of tax benefits.        
	The Reserve Bank of India deregulated interest rates payable by banks on fixed deposits in October 1997, but the interest rate on savings deposits continued to be under the administrative regime.         
	The interest rate on savings bank deposits was reduced from 4 per cent to 3.5 per cent from March 2003 and since then it has not been revised upwards though the inflation rate touched a high of 13 per cent.        
	The need for deregulating the interest rate on savings bank accounts cropped up many times. Banks, however, are not keen because savings deposits are their main source of low-cost funds.        
	New norms        
	Come April 2010, things may change for the better for savings bank depositors. Through a memorandum on April 24 this year, the RBI had asked all commercial banks to consider payment of interest on savings bank accounts on a daily basis.         
	The Indian Banks Association has said this will be possible only if the banks are fully computerised.         
	The RBI, however, believes that the present level of computerisation in banks is satisfactory for the interest payment on a savings bank account on a daily minimum balance basis from April 1, 2010.        
	If this happens, the post-tax interest yield in a savings bank account will rise to 3.4 per cent (considering the declared interest rate remains at 3.5 per cent) from 2.8 per cent now.         
	This will, however, increase the cost of funds for banks, which will in turn not be able to reduce their lending rates. This is because savings bank accounts constitute 25-30 per cent of the total deposits of all commercial banks.        
	Lower returns        
	While deposits in savings bank account will earn higher interest from April 1, 2010, the return will still be much lower than the 6-6.5 per cent from liquid/money market plans of mutual funds.        
	However, many banks these days offer flexi-deposit options whereby the excess deposits over and above a minimum balance in a savings account is transferred to a fixed deposit account offering a higher interest.         
	The effective yields on such flexi savings accounts are higher than the 3.4 per cent yield on an ordinary savings bank account.         
	Cover advantage        
	Many banks also offer free personal accident cover of Rs 1 lakh along with their savings bank account. This is an added advantage because if you have savings accounts in more than one bank, your total personal accident cover can be increased without any additional cost.         
	You can also opt for group life insurance cover that is offered by many banks along with their savings accounts at a fractional cost that you would otherwise have to pay to get the same group life cover.         
	Thus, by opening savings accounts in different banks, you can increase your life insurance coverage and save on expenses that you can invest elsewhere for a higher return.         
	Final count        
	Since a savings bank account gives low yields, the question is how much should one keep in it?        
	One should always keep cash equivalent to three months expenses in a savings bank account and keep a regular update on the credits and debits.         
	With net banking facility, it is quite easy these days to keep a regular count of ones deposits.         
	This may sound needless but it helps to maintain the minimum balance in the account and prevents you from paying penalty because of a shortfall.         
	Net banking facility also offers money transfer and bill payment facilities at low costs.         
	Instead of keeping cash with you, keep in your bank account and use the ATMs for any cash need. The longer the money stays in your bank account, the more interest it will earn.         
	Besides, money is more safe in bank accounts. ATM cash withdrawals these days dont involve any cost even if you use other banks machines.         
	Always update your bank account passbook, this will help you at the time of filing income tax return.        
	Your money management will get much easier if you follow these simple rules.

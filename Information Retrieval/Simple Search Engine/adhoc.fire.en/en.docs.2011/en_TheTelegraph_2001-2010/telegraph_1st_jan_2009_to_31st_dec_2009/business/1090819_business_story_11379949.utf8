The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Posco sees end to land woes
                                                                                                               Posco sees end to land woes
          R. SURYAMURTHY                          Rough ride                                  
	New Delhi, Aug. 18: The Indian subsidiary of South Koreas Pohang Steel Company (Posco) is hopeful of getting land from the Orissa government soon, which will enable its proposed steel plant to get off the ground, a senior company official said.        
	We are hopeful that within the next six months, the state will be able to provide the land to us. The process of land acquisition is in various stages of progress, S.K. Mahapatra, general manager of Posco India, told The Telegraph.        
	He denied that the company planned to move its Rs 51,000-crore steel plant to another site.         
	Posco is facing problems of land (acquisition). Recently they came to me. They have decided to move to a different place, mines minister B.K. Handique had told reporters on the sidelines of an industry event.        
	However, he later clarified that Posco would not move out of Orissa  where the firm was awaiting iron ore leases  but they might shift to a different location.        
	Handique said his ministry would talk to the state government to expedite the process of granting iron ore leases to Posco and ArcellorMittal.        
	Orissa had recommended the grant of a prospecting licence for the Khandadhar iron ore reserves to Posco. However, Orissa High Court had directed the Union government not to take any decision on the state governments proposal after the mining lease was challenged by public sector Kudremukh Iron Ore Limited.        
	We had no plans to relocate the plant in the past nor any now. We have never considered such an option. We are committed to the Orissa project, Mahapatra said.        
	After much delay and resistance by the local people, the Supreme Court in August last year allowed the Orissa government to use forest land for the construction of the Rs 51,000-crore integrated steel plant project at Kujanga near Paradip in Jagatsinghpur district.        
	Of the 4,004 acres allotted to Posco for the project by the state government, 3,300 acres are forest land. Almost 89 per cent of the land allotted is government owned, and only 438 acres are private land.        
	Posco had signed an MoU with the Orissa government on June 22, 2005, to build a 12 million tonnes per annum plant by 2016 near the Paradip port. However, owing to stiff opposition from the local people, land acquisition became difficult.         
	The Posco plant is the countrys largest foreign direct investment project. Posco was expected to invest $12 billion. The South Korean firm had planned to complete the project in three phases, creating a capacity of 4 million tonnes in each phase.

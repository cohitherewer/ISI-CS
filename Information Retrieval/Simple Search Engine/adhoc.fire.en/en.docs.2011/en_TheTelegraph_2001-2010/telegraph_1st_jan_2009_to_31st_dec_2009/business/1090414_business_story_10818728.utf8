                                                                                                               Employee reaction mixed
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Hyderabad, April 13: The news of Satyams sale to Tech Mahindra attracted mixed reactions from employees and investors.         
	We just hope it ends our nightmare and brings us back to the top from where we have slipped to the 24th slot in the last few months, said Parashuram Netam, a software designer in Hyderabad.        
	The news that Tech Mahindra had taken a 31 per cent stake in Satyam did not enthuse many senior ERP and Java technicians at Satyam. Our role will be clipped as Tech Mahindra has a larger presence in telecom, said Govind Naik, who works at the Pune unit of Satyam.         
	Satyam Freshers Union convener P. Varun is happy that the confusion has come to an end and the new owners can take an early decision on the fate of freshers. The present board does not want to absorb us, but we feel the new owners can take a considered view, he said.         
	Satyam has lost almost eight of the Fortune-500 companies who were clients and the loss of projects will affect most of us, said Prashant Kumar, an employee who is moving to another company.         
	There was a mild response from investors on Tech Mahindra emerging as the preferred bidder. It is not a good news, but not a bad news either, said Prakash Jain, a stock broker in Hyderabad. The Satyam stock had improved to Rs 58 after the announcement.        
	Investors said the profile of Tech Mahindra was not a plus point for Satyam which was a software designer and service company.         
	Attrition rate        
	Satyam has lost about 5,000 employees between September 2008 and March 2009. At the end of the fourth quarter, the employee strength was 48,000. Of this, 43,500 were direct employees, and the rest were working for subsidiaries, chairman Kiran Karnik said today.         
	At the end of the second quarter, Satyam had 53,000 employees. In the third quarter, 2,000 left Satyam, making it 51,000, of which 45,000 were direct employees, he added.        
	Nearly 750 employees have found new jobs in April and another 600 have appeared for interviews.

          OUR BUREAU                          Rangarajan: Hopeful                                  
	Dec. 3: Chakravarthy Rangarajan  the top economic adviser to the Prime Minister  today predicted that the economy would grow 7 per cent this year even as the top officials at the Reserve Bank of India said they would be revisiting their growth forecasts when they hunker down for their quarterly monetary policy review in January.         
	Back in October, the growth forecast for the year to March 2010 had been pegged at 6.5 per cent. Reserve Bank governor Duvvuri Subbarao told reporters at Jalanga village in Orissa that the central bank would revisit its earlier forecast at the January meeting.         
	In the July-September quarter, the economy surged 7.9 per cent, stunning economists who had expected the farm sector to temper growth after one of the worst monsoons in 25 years.         
	However, Rangarajan said the big worry was the surge in food prices which had soared 17.47 per cent year on year in the third week of November from 15.58 per cent a week ago as supply shortages accentuated the effects of a weak monsoon.         
	Rangarajan said food prices would have to be controlled else the RBI would have to adopt monetary measures to squelch inflation. Food prices must be controlled otherwise they have a tendency to lead to inflation in the prices of manufactured goods. This will require monetary action, especially on the supply management side, Rangarajan said on the sidelines of a conference here today.         
	Rangarajan said overall inflation would be in the range of 6-6.5 per cent by this fiscal end, as expected by the council. But it should be brought down.        
	Overall inflation doubled to 1.34 per cent in October compared with 0.50 per cent in the previous month.         
	Potatoes, onions, pulses and vegetables played a big part in the 17.47 per cent rise in food inflation for the latest reporting week (November 21).        
	Prices of potatoes and onions were up 94.17 per cent and 30.89 per cent, respectively, compared with the previous year. Pulses, too, were up 37.83 per cent, while the cost of vegetables was up 20.4 per cent from last year.        
	At Jalanga, Subbarao asked bankers to stress on agriculture financing to accelerate growth in the rural areas. Bankers should stress on financing rural areas to ensure rapid economic growth in villages, Subbarao said. He said the focus should be on providing loans to the farm sector to ensure a greater use of modern technology.

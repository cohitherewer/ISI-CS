The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Legal shield for Satyam board
                                                                                                               Legal shield for Satyam board
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          EXtra COver                                  
	New Delhi, Jan. 29: The company law board today granted the new board members of Satyam Computer immunity from lawsuits.        
	A similar cover will also be given to the yet-to-be-appointed chief executive officer and chief financial officer, who will join the board as government nominees.         
	In its order, the company law board also granted immunity to the members from any action by the government agencies. The directors are like court officers discharging a public service, sources said.         
	The immunity is also for the other functionaries of the scam-tainted company to be appointed by the new board.         
	Analysts said immunity was an issue with the board and a big hurdle to the appointment of the CEO and the CFO. Nobody really wants to join a company when he can face a prospective series of lawsuits or enforcement actions based on a predecessors acts, they said.        
	Prem Chand Gupta, the minister of company affairs, had said that the hunt for the CEO was over. He said there were cases in different courts against Satyam and they (prospective CEO and CFO) want protection.        
	Along with choosing the CEO, the board is evaluating options on firms interested in Satyam.         
	Tarun Das, a government nominee to the board and the chief mentor of the CII, said as many as seven suitors, including private equity players, were keen.         
	 So far we are aware of four (companies that have approached Satyam Computer). But we have heard that another two or three firms are also interested, Das said.        
	The Satyam board has appointed Goldman Sachs and Avendus Capital as investment bankers and mandated Boston Consulting Group to be its management adviser.        
	Satyam had plunged into chaos earlier this month when its founder B. Ramalinga Raju admitted to a Rs 7,100-crore fraud.         
	To prevent a repeat of Satyam, state-run gas utility GAIL (India) today said it had decided to constitute an ethics committee comprising some board members.

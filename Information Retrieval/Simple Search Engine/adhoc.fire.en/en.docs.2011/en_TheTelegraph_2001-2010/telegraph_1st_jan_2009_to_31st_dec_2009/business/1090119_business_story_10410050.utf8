The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Prasad clears air on Maytas
                                                                                                               Prasad clears air on Maytas
                            
	New Delhi, Jan. 18 (PTI): Amid criticism of independent directors for clearing the acquisition of Maytas Properties by Satyam for Rs 6,410 crore, former director T.R. Prasad today said the board-approved formula would have brought down the purchase price by less than half.        
	I informally understand from real estate dealers that under this (suggested) valuation formula, the outgo from Satyam would have dropped to less than 50 per cent of the upper limit proposed by the management, Prasad said.        
	Asked about the announcement of acquisition of Maytas Properties on December 16  which was dumped a day later  Prasad, a former cabinet secretary, said the board approval was for investment of up to Rs 6,410 crore subject to a valuation formula.        
	By no stretch of imagination can it be construed as an outright approval for acquisition at Rs 6,410 crore, he said.        
	Prasad said he had supported the acquisition at the crucial board meeting on the explicit stipulation that the acquisitions be based on valuation derived from notifications of regulators and government.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | SAIL to put upgrade on fast track
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      SAIL to put upgrade on fast track
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Singh: Keeping pace                                  
	New Delhi, Dec. 7 Steel minister Virbhadra Singh today asked Steel Authority of India Ltd to draw up a timetable for its Rs 60,000 crore modernisation programme, which he might personally review.        
	Prodded by the Prime Ministers Office, which wants all core sector ministries to speed up their projects, Singh had called a review meeting of SAILs projects.         
	The meeting was attended by the directors of SAIL along with the top officials of the steel ministry.         
	Singh had earlier told The Telegraph, The expansion programme which started in 2005 has been slow. I am trying to expedite it. The minister had blamed red tape and negotiations with equipment manufacturers, sometimes resulting in repeated tenders, for the delays.        
	Of the Rs 60,000-crore, SAIL will invest Rs 37,000 crore in expanding capacity by 10 million tonnes; the remaining amount will be used to improve product mix and technology, and for removing bottlenecks.         
	The state-run steel giant would have spent Rs 17,400 crore by the end of fiscal 2010.         
	Singh wants the steel major to give him quarterly schedules of the modernisation exercise, which he will monitor.         
	SAILs follow-on public offer of 10 per cent equity will come up before the cabinet soon. However, the ministry has linked the offer with a faster modernisation on SAILs part.         
	The government owns 86 per cent in SAIL, which has its own iron ore and coal mines. A dilution of 5 per cent holding can bring SAIL about Rs 4,000 crore.         
	The government can earn a similar amount if it sells matching equity.         
	SAILs share price hit a 52-week high of 215.30 on the BSE on December 2, though it closed at Rs 204.90 on Monday. SAILs equity base stands at a paltry Rs 4140.40 crore.        
	Analysts say the SAIL stock can rise up to 50 per cent over the next 18 to 24 months on the back of infrastructure growth in India and the revival of industry in Asia.

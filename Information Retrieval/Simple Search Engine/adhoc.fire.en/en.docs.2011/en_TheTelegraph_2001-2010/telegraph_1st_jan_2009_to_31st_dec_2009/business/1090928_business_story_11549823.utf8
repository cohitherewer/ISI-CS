   The players: 

 IOC rsquo;s XTRAPREMIUM, BPCL rsquo;s Speed and HPCL rsquo;s Power are the brands
 Bad times: 

 Sales fell from September last year because of 
 slowdown. The excise
 duty hike in the budget 
 worsened the situation
 Good times hope: 

 Business banking on surge in auto sales. Already, sales are up 1-3 per cent in August
  
	Mumbai, Sept. 27: Car makers arent the only ones who have started cranking up expectations of a strong recovery. Domestic oil companies are now gung-ho about an incipient auto boom as they reckon it will spur the sales of branded fuels for cars.
    
	Sales of branded fuels have slumped since September last year as a result of the economic slowdown and the car owners marked shift towards regular fuels that have no chemical additives with claims to boost engine performance.
    
	To make matters worse, finance minister Pranab Mukherjee raised excise duty on branded fuels in his July budget, hurting sales of companies such as Indian Oil Corporation Ltd (IOC), Bharat Petroleum Corporation Ltd (BPCL) and Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Ltd (HPCL).
    
	Mukherjee had raised the basic excise duty on branded motor spirit (or petrol) from 6 per cent plus Rs 5 per litre to a specific rate of Rs 6.50 per litre. Similarly, the basic excise duty on branded diesel was converted from 6 per cent plus Rs 1.25 per litre to a specific rate of Rs 2.75 per litre.
    
	Industry circles said the duty hike widened the price differential between regular and branded fuels, which further alienated consumers. 
    
	Earlier, we used to sell branded petrol at around Rs 1.25 per litre more than that of regular petrol. However, with the changes in excise duty, the differential in petrol has shot up to over Rs 2 per litre. In branded diesel, prices rose around Rs 1.75 per litre, a senior official from an oil marketing company told The Telegraph.
    
	He said the price rise led to a sharp drop in branded fuel sales.
    
	Earlier, in 2008-09, sales of BPCLs branded petrol  Speed  declined to over 6.10 lakh tonnes from a little over 7.70 lakh tonnes in the previous fiscal. Speed used to account for over 26 per cent of BPCLs overall motor spirit sales in 2007-08. It dropped to 19 per cent in 2008-09. Its competitors faced the same fate. 
    
	At present, IOC is the market leader in premium fuels with its XTRAPREMIUM having a 56 per cent market share in the petrol category. Power is HPCLs premium fuel brand.
    
	The recent spurt in automobile sales has raised a glimmer of hope that oil companies can ratchet up sales of their branded fuels that have a slightly higher margin.
    
	We are hopeful of a pick-up in branded fuel sales as the economy is showing signs of a recovery. Consumers are already aware of the advantages of using these fuels and, therefore, a shift can be seen in the near future, the official said.
    
	He added that such a shift could begin with branded petrol. It will be challenging in the case of diesel as it is largely used by commercial vehicles.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Farm land worry for IPO-bound Emaar
                                                                                                               Farm land worry for IPO-bound Emaar
          SAMBIT SAHA                                           
	Calcutta, Oct. 11: Real estate developer Emaar MGF, which is planning an initial public offering, has disclosed that it is yet to convert three-fourths of its landholdings into plots for real estate development.         
	The company, which has completed one project in the last four years, claims to possess 11,340 acres, of which around 8,660 acres is agricultural land.         
	According to Indian laws, relevant authorities, mostly at the state level, must officially allow the use of agricultural land for non-agricultural purposes.         
	The process is usually cumbersome and time-consuming. Moreover, the government may disallow the conversion of agricultural land to protect the interests of the farmers.         
	So far, Emaar MGF has started the process for 1,711.2 acres, and the applications are pending with various authorities.         
	The procedure and the cost of obtaining a certificate for the change of land use vary from state to state.         
	The disclosure made by the company in its IPO filing to market regulator Sebi raises doubts about its capability to complete the projects in time.        
	In its submission before Sebi, the company said it was not sure of obtaining the necessary permissions and certificates for the change of land use that are required to execute its business plans.         
	The company said it believed the majority of its land was part of the government-approved master plan area. However, the government may change such designated area, which can jeopardise the companys plans.         
	Emaar MGF is one of the prominent firms among a string of real estate developers queuing up for a public float.         
	The firms public issue had devolved in early 2008 as investors refused to subscribe to the high-priced shares. It now seeks to raise up to Rs 3,850 crore through its IPO.         
	The company believes it is now well equipped to sell the issue to investors as it plans to complete a few of its ongoing projects in the next fiscal, including the prestigious Commonwealth Games village in New Delhi.         
	It had suffered a loss of Rs 74.1 crore in the last fiscal.         
	Bengal plans         
	Emaar MGF has 45.1 acres of land in Bengal. It had earlier proposed to build three hotels in the city, including a 250-room JW Marriott property across a five-acre plot on the EM Bypass. It had bought the land in 2007 paying a very high price.        
	Besides, plans are there to build Park Hyatt and Holiday Inn properties here. The firm plans to use the RCTC (Royal Calcutta Turf Club) property on Russell Street for one of the hotels.         
	Emaar MGF has a 20-acre plot on the outskirts of the city for a residential project. According to real estate circles, the land is located on Kona Expressway.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Nov. 20: The government has decided against importing rice because of high prices in the world markets.        
	However, the Centre will continue to hold talks with other countries on import on a government-to-government basis.         
	We are not importing. We have adequate stocks. We will review if there is any need (in the future), commerce and industry minister Anand Sharma told reporters after a meeting of the empowered group of ministers on food headed by finance minister Pranab Mukherjee.        
	On India talking to Thailand for rice, Sharma said, We have reviewed the rice budget, keeping in view the need for buffer and strategic reserves. We have excess quantity available.        
	Both Mukherjee and Sharma had talked about the possibility of bringing rice from abroad amidst a projected slump in production by over 15 million tonnes in kharif 2009-10.        
	State-owned trading companies are awaiting the governments direction on the bids they have received against global tenders for the import of 30,000 tonnes.         
	The imports tenders will now die naturally as the price quoted are very high compared with the price paid to Indian farmers, sources said.        
	The state firms received 18 bids for rice ranging from $373 per tonne to $599.

	New Delhi, Dec. 25: Car companies are revving up to showcase their latest models at the Delhi auto show to be held in the first week of January.        
	The automobile extravaganza, held every two years in the capital, will see the global launch of over 10 vehicles.         
	Among the hot rods vying for attention is the 5-series Gran Turismo from BMW. It was first unveiled at the Geneva Auto Show earlier this year as a concept car, and the production model has been codenamed F07. The Turismo will be a crossover between a sports sedan and an SUV.         
	Another sports utility vehicle to watch out for is Hyundais Santa FE. Indias second-largest auto maker will also showcase its Avante sedan, besides the i30 hatchback and the i40 sedan.         
	Not to be left behind, Maruti Suzuki, the countrys largest car company, will unveil its entry-level D segment sedan Kizashi. The car is likely to be priced over Rs 10 lakh.         
	While Toyota Motors  back at the gala after six years  plans to launch hybrid sedan Prius, Volkswagen AG, Europes largest car maker, will have compact car Polo and SUV Tiguan.         
	In small cars, General Motors, Maruti and Volkswagen are expected to showcase their offerings.         
	Maruti will hold the world premiere of a concept multi-purpose vehicle, designed by Indian engineers. The six-seater, named R3, has been carved out over a period of nine months.        
	Marutis list of displays includes the Eeco, which will replace the Versa.        
	Honda will display the concept of its low-cost model that is being built for India and other emerging nations. The car will hit the market around 2012. Toyotas concept mini car for India will be launched towards the end of next year.         
	Tata Motors will come up with four offerings, details of which are still under wraps. Sources say one of the launches can be a small car.        
	Two prominent absentees will be Japans Nissan and US auto maker Ford. The show will have 2,100 participants from 30 countries.        
	According to analysts, small car sales are expected to be brisk next year with Maruti and Hyundai having an edge over the new entrants because of their brand value.        
	Small cars from global firms will make the competition more healthy. But for the immense brand value, after-sales service and price sensitivity that players such as Maruti and Hyundai have created, they will enjoy an advantage, said analyst Murad Ali Baig.        
	New entrants will dominate the market but they will not affect the existing players much. However, the picture will be clear only after the new cars are rolled out, said Rajeev Kapoor, CEO of Fiat India.        
	Indias automobile industry is among the first to recover from the global economic slump.         
	Sales have surged 18 per cent to 7.8 million in the eight months from April to November.

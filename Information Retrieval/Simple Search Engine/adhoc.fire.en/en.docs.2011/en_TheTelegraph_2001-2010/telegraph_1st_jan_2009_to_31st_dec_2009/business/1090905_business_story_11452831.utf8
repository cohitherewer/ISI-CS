The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Religare snaps Swiss Re ties
                                                                                                               Religare snaps Swiss Re ties
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Mumbai, Sept. 4: Religare Enterprises has dropped plans to establish a health insurance venture with Swiss Reinsurance Company just three months after the two entities announced the alliance.        
	Both the partners have now decided to go their separate ways in India. They have also decided mutually not to renew a non-binding term sheet to develop the health insurance venture. The deadline for the term sheet, which was signed on June 1, had lapsed on August 20.        
	Religare officials did not say why the joint venture had been called off. It is thought that Swiss Re developed cold feet as the joint venture could create a potential conflict of interest since it served as a reinsurer to various health insurance companies. The buzz is that Swiss Re is not even confident of lending its brand name to the venture because of this fear. This, however, could not be confirmed.        
	Religare wishes to go ahead aggressively in health insurance, keeping its broader goals in mind. Committed to offer its services in health insurance, the company is open to considering new potential partners, said the company spokesperson.        
	Swiss Re remains committed to offering its actuarial and underwriting expertise in the important Indian market, and continues to be open to exploring a health insurance joint venture, said a Swiss Re official.

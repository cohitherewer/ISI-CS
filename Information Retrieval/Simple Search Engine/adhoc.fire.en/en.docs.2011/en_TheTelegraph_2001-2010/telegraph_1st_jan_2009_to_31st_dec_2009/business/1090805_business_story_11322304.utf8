                                                                                                               Essar buys Shree Precoated
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Mumbai, Aug. 4: Essar Steel has entered into a pact to acquire the steel assets of Shree Precoated Steels Ltd (SPSL).         
	The acquisition will make the Ruia company the countrys largest cold roller and colour coated steel producer.        
	The net consideration of the deal is around Rs 500 crore, and the acquisition will include the current assets, fixed assets and the debt of SPSL. While SPSLs fixed assets are valued at Rs 600 crore, the long-term debt is estimated at Rs 175 crore.        
	Essar Steel CEO J. Mehra said the transaction was likely to be completed within two months.        
	According to Mehra, the acquisition will add Rs 2,600 crore to the turnover of Essar Steel, annually. The Ruia company plans to ramp up the capacity of the assets being acquired. The assets to be transferred are a colour coating line, a cold rolling mill, a galvanising line and a pickling line.         
	The SPSL plant is at Sanaswadi near Pune in Maharashtra. With this acquisition, Essar Steel hopes to serve the western and southern markets better.        
	With Essars 4.6-million-tonne-per-annum steel making capacity at Hazira, where it mostly produces HR coils, steady supply of raw material to the SPSL plant will not be a problem.        
	Essar Steel is ramping up the capacity at its Hazira plant to 9.6 million tonnes, and the plant will go on stream from the first quarter of the next financial year.        
	This acquisition is a strategic fit for our steel business as this gives us a leadership position in many product segments and also gives us a footprint across different product segments, Mehra said.

                                                                                                               KG tiff sends wrong signals to new bidders
          R. SURYAMURTHY                          Chain reaction                                  
	New Delhi, Aug. 30: New bidders for oil and gas blocks may turn cautious after the blazing Ambani brothers row on gas price, but the older players are likely to remain unaffected, analysts said.        
	Roadshows have started this month for the eighth round of oil and gas hunt under the New Exploration and Licensing Policy  Indias biggest with 70 exploration blocks on offer. Analysts said the pricing was a major concern for the bidders.        
	Oil and gas exploration is a high-risk business with more chances of failure than success. If there is uncertainty over the pricing, which is not market linked or lower than the competitive global markets, exploration and production firms may think twice before venturing into India, Arvind Mahajan, executive director of KPMG, said.        
	Another analyst of a foreign brokerage, who did not wish to be named, said, The existing gas price in India is significantly lower than the international prices. Rationalisation of gas price is a must to attract investment in the development of gasfields and infrastructure. Cost-plus mechanisms will deter investment and competitiveness.        
	An empowered group of ministers had formulated the price on a cost-plus principle, where a return is guaranteed on all capital expenditure.         
	According to the analysts, by incurring capital expenditure, the contractor takes all risks, including the reservoir performance risk. In the case of failure, this expenditure is treated as a sunk cost by the contractor. On a successful discovery and production, the cost is shared between the contractor and the government.         
	This leaves little space for market forces to determine the gas price on an arms length basis, they said.        
	Mukesh Ambanis Reliance Industries Limited and brother Anils Reliance Natural Resources Limited will slug it out in the Supreme Court in October on the price of gas from the formers Krishna-Godavari (K-G) fields. RNRL is demanding $2.34 per million British thermal unit (mBtu) against the government mandated price of $4.20.        
	Petroleum minister Murli Deora had said that the KG gas price was lower than the average of $5.51 per mBtu charged by the UKs BG-led consortium for Panna, Mukta and Tapti fields.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Reliance gas sniffs tax break
                                                                                                               Reliance gas sniffs tax break
  - Budget fine print provides comfort to industry but offers little to lift economy mood        R. SURYAMURTHY                          Bhide: Sop mood                                        
	New Delhi, July 8: Reliance Industries gasfield in the KG basin is likely to get a seven-year tax holiday.        
	Finance minister Pranab Mukherjee has extended the tax holiday under section 80-IB(9) of the income tax act to natural gas. So far it was applicable to profits from the commercial production or refining of mineral oil.         
	The extension of tax holiday, however, comes with a rider that the benefit will be available to gas produced in blocks licensed under Nelp-VIII or those that begun commercial production after April 1, 2009.        
	Since Reliances KG-D6 block had begun commercial production on April 2 this year from its Dhirubhai 1 and 3 discoveries on the east coast of the country, analysts felt that the Mukesh Ambani flagship would be eligible for the tax break.        
	Revenue secretary P.V. Bhide said, The benefits of the tax holiday for gas would be prospective. The finance bill has made it clear that mineral oil will include crude and gas.        
	According to analysts, Mukherjee has put an end to the controversy around tax holiday for RIL D-6 gas as it started production after April 1, 2009.        
	During the 2008 budget, then finance minister P. Chidambaram had made certain changes in the finance bill, creating ambiguity in the classification of mineral oil.         
	Miffed by the confusion, exploration and production (E amp;P) firms had moved court against the changes made in the income tax act. While the court will take a decision on the petitions filed by the E amp;P firms, the latest government clarification may come in handy for them, feels Arvind Mahajan, an oil analyst with KPMG.        
	Some industry observers, however, feel that Reliance may not finally get the benefit of tax holiday as the KG basin is a Nelp-I block, and the definition of mineral oil, which brings crude and gas on a par, is applicable only to Nelp-VIII.        
	RILs KG basin is the biggest gas discovery in the country, so the tax component too will be huge.         
	Industry is now keenly awaiting a statement from Mukherjee clarifying the position when he replies to the budget debate in Parliament.        
	At present, Reliance can produce close to 40 mmcmd but is restricting its output to 28 mmcmd in the absence of buyers. The production is expected to reach a peak of 80 mmscmd by 2012.

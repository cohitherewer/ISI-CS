The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Renault alert on local ties 
                                                                                                               Renault alert on local ties 
                              Carlos Ghosn in Tokyo on Wednesday. (AFP)                            
	Tokyo, Oct. 21 (PTI): Renault today hinted that all was not well in its partnership with Mahindra and Mahindra. The French auto major said it could sever ties and even drive in its new product in India with a different partner.        
	Renault, which has a joint venture with M amp;M that sells the entry-level sedan, Logan, has been a subject of speculation over its relationship with the Indian partner. Declining sales of the car have put a question mark over the future of the joint venture  Mahindra Renault Pvt Ltd  in which the French firm has a 49 per cent stake.        
	Renault has two other alliances in India  one with Bajaj Auto for small cars and the other with Ashok Leyland, via Nissan, for light commercial vehicles.        
	I am not saying we will, I am saying we can. I dont want anybody to be surprised. We have today three partners (in India). Our intention is to continue with the three partners, but if it is not possible, I can tell you that we need at least one, Renault president and CEO Carlos Ghosn said at the Tokyo Motor Show.        
	He was responding to a query if Renault was unhappy with any of its Indian partners, particularly with M amp;M, following the dismal performance of the Logan.         
	The Logan has failed to live up to the expectations and sales have been on a slide. In September, 510 units of the car were sold compared with 1,752 units in the same month last year. In the first six months of this fiscal, the joint venture sold 2,901 units of Logan compared with 9,217 units in the same period last year.        
	Ghosn said the failure of Logan was because it is more expensive than we hoped it would be in India and the Indian market is extremely sensitive to the price. Another reason is we dont have enough localisation in India.

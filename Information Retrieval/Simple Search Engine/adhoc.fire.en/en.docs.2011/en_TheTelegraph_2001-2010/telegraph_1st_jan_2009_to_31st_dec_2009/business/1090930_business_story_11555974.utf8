	Mumbai, Sept. 29: Tata Teleservices (Maharashtra) Ltd is planning to raise $250 million (Rs 1,202 crore) from domestic and foreign markets to partly finance its bid for 3G spectrum which is due to be auctioned later this year.        
	The Tata group company is seeking shareholders approval through a postal ballot to raise the amount through foreign currency convertible bonds, American depository receipts or global depository receipts.         
	In a filing with the stock exchanges, TTML said it could also raise funds by placing shares with qualified institutional buyers.        
	TTML indicated that funds raised from the issue might also be used to invest in its existing network to match competitors reach, gain better incremental market share and maintain its growth in the subscriber base.         
	It added that these securities could be listed on the Indian or foreign stock exchanges.

	New Delhi, Sept. 7: Indias economy is resilient enough to grow at over 6 per cent in the current fiscal at a time when a drought in Uttar Pradesh and Bihar threatens to slow down growth in this quarter and the next, finance minister Pranab Mukherjee said today.         
	Kharif production in 58 districts of UP and 38 districts of Bihar have been affected, Mukherjee said. Punjab and Haryana protected their crops by mining underground water at a heavy cost. However, Unctad, in a report released today, predicted a lower growth of 5 per cent in 2009.         
	Mukherjee said sufficient stocks of foodgrains and a higher government spending on rural jobs would help to beat the drought.         
	If rains revive in the remaining June-September monsoon period, that will replenish water reservoirs and help winter crops.        
	Some 81 per cent of Indias dams and irrigation catchments are now filled up as a result of the late August and September rain.         
	However, the poor rain in July and for the most part of August means the 6.1 per cent growth of the first quarter will not be maintained in the second and third quarters.        
	Rural banking        
	Mukherjee said remote rural regions and the administrative blocks in the rural areas with a large minority population should have bank branches. It has been mandated that by March 31, 2010, either a public sector bank or a private bank should have a branch office in the unbanked blocks of the country, he said.

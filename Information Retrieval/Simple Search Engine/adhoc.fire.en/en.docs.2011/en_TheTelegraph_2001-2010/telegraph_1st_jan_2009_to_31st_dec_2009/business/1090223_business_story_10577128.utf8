The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Escrow hope for Satyam bidders
                                                                                                               Escrow hope for Satyam bidders
          PIYA SINGH                          JUGGLING OPTIONS                                  
	Mumbai, Feb. 22: The board of directors of Satyam Computer Services is likely to approach the Company Law Board (CLB) and the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) on Monday for regulatory approvals for the process it has devised to bring a strategic investor on board.         
	Satyam is widely expected to put up for auction at least a 26 per cent stake.        
	However, in the absence of a full restatement of accounts of scam-scarred Satyam, the potential bidders will be looking for a level of comfort on the accuracy of the books.        
	The auditors are already poring over the books of Satyam that go back six years.        
	A serious buyer will be wary of what he could discover in the companys books. They are bound to insist on some conditions in the sale process since the company plans to induct a strategic investor without first restating the accounts, said a banker.        
	It is still unclear what these conditions can be. A section of financial advisers said one of the options could be the creation of an escrow account. The buyer, who is selected through an auction, can put a part of the payment for the strategic stake into an escrow account until there is some clarity on the real financials of the company, they said.        
	The creation of an escrow account seems to be an option as the restatement of accounts will run into a few months, at least, said a source close to the development.        
	Escrow is typical in complex mergers and acquisitions where certain conditions have to be fulfilled before the money is actually transferred to the seller.        
	Other bankers and M amp;A experts, however, disagree with the view and say they do not believe that an escrow mechanism will be the ideal way forward for the strategic stake sale in Satyam.        
	Since the open offer of 20 per cent will in all probability be a significant part of the deal, the escrow account route will leave too many loose ends, said an M amp;A specialist.         
	The Jet Airways-Air Sahara merger was one of the recent M amp;A deals where an escrow mechanism was used.         
	In January 2006, Jet agreed to buy Air Sahara for $500 million and the latters operations were taken over by a team from Jet. As part of this transaction, a sum of Rs 1,500 crore was parked in an escrow account.        
	The deal between the two airlines hit a rough patch in June as regulatory approvals, including security clearance for Jet Airways chairman Naresh Goyal, were still pending.         
	Air Sahara moved a Lucknow court to stop Jet from operating the escrow account before the expiry of the June 21 deadline that had been set for completing the share purchase agreement between the two entities.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Hemant Luthra in Mumbai on Tuesday. (PTI)                                  
	Mumbai, Dec. 15: The Mahindras are planning to make planes and allied aerospace components to serve the global market.         
	Mahindra amp; Mahindra (M amp;M), the Rs 13,364-crore automobile maker, today announced that it had picked up a 75.1 per cent stake in two Australian aerospace firms for Rs 175 crore, marking its strategic entry into the aerospace business.        
	In a joint acquisition with Kotak Private Equity, Mahindra Aerospace Pvt Ltd bought a majority stake in component maker Aerostaff Australia and general aircraft manufacturer, Gippsland Aeronautics.        
	In the next five years, we believe that we could build as many as 475 aircraft in the 2- to 20-seater range and expect a peak revenue of about Rs 650 crore, said Hemant Luthra, member of M amp;Ms group management board.        
	The Mahindras will retain the top management in both companies. They will also set up a plant in Bangalore to complement these acquisitions and provide dual shoring cost benefits to customers.        
	M amp;Ms move into the aerospace segment is deliberate, bold and timely, and is supported by a renewed demand for economical air transportation around the world. Our investment in component capability addresses the growing needs of both the civil and defence markets, said Anand Mahindra, vice-chairman and managing director of the Mahindra group.        
	The market for turboprops is amongst the fastest growing segments in general aviation. Turboprops provide operational adaptability in environments with poor infrastructure and can serve the market at the lowest cost per passenger seat kilometre.        
	M amp;M had announced its intention to enter this business in 2006 when it acquired Flexion Technologies, an engineering design company.        
	Gippsland Aeronautics is an established brand in general aviation and has delivered more than 200 FAR-23 certified planes in 32 countries.         
	The FAR 23 certification is mandatory for carrying fare-paying passengers and signifies the highest level of passenger safety.

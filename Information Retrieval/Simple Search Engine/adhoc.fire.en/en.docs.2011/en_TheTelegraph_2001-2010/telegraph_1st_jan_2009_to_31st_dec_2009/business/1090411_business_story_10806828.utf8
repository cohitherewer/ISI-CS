	Calcutta, April 10: Egypt wants Jet Airways and Kingfisher Airlines to start direct flights between India and Cairo to strengthen ties between the countries.         
	We propose to provide tax concessions and exemptions on various accounts to attract private airlines, ambassador of Egypt Mohamed Higazy said on the sidelines of an interactive session organised by the Merchants Chamber of Commerce here today.        
	At present, national carrier Egypt Air operates direct flights between Cairo and Mumbai for four days a week. Earlier, Air India had flights to Cairo. But they stopped those flights in 1970s, Higazy said.        
	We are also planning to connect a few more Indian cities through direct flights from Cairo. Cities under consideration are Calcutta, Delhi and either Bangalore or Chennai, he said.         
	Higazy said Egypt was in talks with the Kirloskar group for irrigation and land reclamation in Toshka region, which is in the northern part of the country. Kirloskar has recently received a $20-million pumping station contract in Egypt, he said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Sterlite betters Asarco offer price
                                                                                                               Sterlite betters Asarco offer price
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                            
	Mumbai, Sept. 11: Anil Agarwal-owned Sterlite Industries (India) today launched an aggressive attempt to wrest control of Asarco LLC with a revised all-cash offer of $2.56 billion, a 20 per cent increase over its earlier offer of $2.13 billion.        
	Sterlite is locked in a year-long battle with Grupo Mexico to acquire Asarco, and its current offer is 3.8 per cent higher than the Mexican mining companys bid of $2.47 billion.         
	The price revision comes just 10 days after a US bankruptcy court recommended the acceptance of Grupo Mexicos bid to acquire Asarco. The court had recommended to a federal district court in the US that it approved Grupo Mexicos plan rather than that of Sterlite as it was more likely to pay creditors in full.         
	The federal district court is expected to take a final decision over the next few weeks.         
	Sterlites current offer is close to its initial offer of $2.6 billion that it made in 2008 before the global downturn forced it to seek a downward revision of the price, sparking Grupo Mexicos renewed interest in a company that it once briefly owned.        
	In an announcement to stock exchanges today, Sterlite said it increased the offer from $2.13 billion to $2.56 billion in cash after extensive discussions and review where it was decided to provide full cash payment to the asbestos creditors and to allow for other claims.        
	Sterlite added that the modification to the plan had been submitted to the US district court for its consideration. Sterlites offer earlier included a combination of a little over $1.58 billion in cash and $208 million in copper price participation notes. The cash component was subsequently increased.         
	Copper price participation is the amount paid to smelters when prices exceed a certain value.        
	In May last year, Sterlite announced its intention of acquiring all the operating assets of Asarco, the Tucson, Arizona-based mining, smelting and refining company, for $2.6 billion in cash.         
	Asarco had filed for bankruptcy and it also faced environment-related liabilities. However, the global slowdown saw Sterlite seeking lower valuation for the company in October last year.        
	Sterlite had indicated then that it would not be picking up the liabilities as it was only interested in acquiring its assets.         
	However, Asarco said the agreement was subject to approval from the US bankruptcy court.         
	Even as Asarco had asked the bankruptcy court to approve its sale to Sterlite, Grupo Mexico, which had bought the copper miner but lacked board control, was against the move.        
	Todays announcement impacted Sterlite shares as the metals maker would now have to pay more for Asarco. On the Bombay Stock Exchange, the Sterlite scrip fell around 3 per cent to Rs 745.90.         
	Analysts said the stock had dipped because of worries over a higher cash outgo but admitted that the acquisition would be beneficial for Sterlite.         
	Global copper prices have started to move up again and have topped $6,000 per tonne from the earlier levels of $4000 per tonne.

	New Delhi, Feb. 13: A higher demand and thrust on network modernisation are expected to improve the revenues of wagon makers.        
	In todays interim budget, railway minister Lalu Prasad raised the target for wagon production to around 15,000 units per annum from 6,600 in 2003-04.         
	Through the modernisation of network and technological upgradation of rolling stock, the capacity of newly constructed tracks has increased significantly, the minister said.        
	Ashok Vijay, senior vice-president of Texmaco Limited, said, The freight corridor theyve announced will boost demand for new technology wagons. The total number of these wagons is likely to go up further.         
	Construction work on the eastern corridor started on February 10 and work on the western line will begin this month, Lalu Prasad said, raising the hopes of wagon manufacturers.        
	Ruia group chairman Pawan K. Ruia said, Wagons with higher capacity are the need of the day. The railway ministers sustained focus in this area will serve a useful purpose for the Indian economy and will benefit the wagon manufacturing industry.        
	Texmaco, Indias biggest private wagon manufacturer, has secured orders for 3,000 wagons in the current fiscal and expects orders for another 4,500-5,000 units in fiscal 2009-10.

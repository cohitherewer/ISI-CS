The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Airline losses set to mount
                                                                                                               Airline losses set to mount
                            
	Geneva, March 24 (Reuters): World airlines are set to lose $4.7 billion this year as a result of the global recession that has shrunk passenger and cargo demand.        
	The International Air Transport Association (IATA) had estimated in December that the industry would lose $2.5 billion in 2009.        
	The state of the airline industry today is grim. Demand has deteriorated much more rapidly with the economic slowdown than could have been anticipated even a few months ago, IATA director-general Giovanni Bisignani said. The relief of lower fuel prices is overshadowed by falling demand and plummeting revenues. The industry is in intensive care, he said.         
	The IATA, which represents 230 airlines, including British Airways, Cathay Pacific, United Airlines and the Emirates, also raised its estimate of international airline losses in 2008 to $8.5 billion, from its previous $8 billion estimate. The Geneva-based body said its latest forecast was based on a view that the economy and air transport demand would hit bottom by mid-2009 and then start to recover. We do expect better prospects toward the end of this year or the beginning of 2010, Bisignani said in a news conference at the Geneva airport.        
	Leading airlines have slashed fares to encourage continued travel and unveiled a range of cost-cutting measures to stay afloat.         
	Fares should stay low throughout the year, while airlines compete for the business that remains until global economic activity rebounds, Bisignani said. Asia-Pacific carriers will continue to be the hardest hit by the global economic turmoil and are expected to post losses of $1.7 billion, against the earlier forecast loss of $1.1 billion in 2009, according to the IATA.        
	Carriers in North America are expected to deliver the best performance among the worlds regions with an estimated $100 million profit, the IATA said, crediting their strength to early capacity cuts and relatively little fuel hedging that has permitted them to benefit from sliding oil prices.

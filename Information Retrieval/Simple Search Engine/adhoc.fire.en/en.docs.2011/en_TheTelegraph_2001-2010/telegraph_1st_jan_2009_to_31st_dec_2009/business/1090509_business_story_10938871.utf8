The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Ten US banks need to raise $75 billion
                                                                                                               Ten US banks need to raise $75 billion

	Washington, May 8: After subjecting the nations biggest banks to the most public scrutiny in decades, federal regulators ordered 10 of them on Thursday to raise a total of $75 billion in extra capital and gave the rest a clean bill of health.         
	The long-awaited results of the stress tests set off an immediate scramble by major institutions for more capital. By June 8, they must give regulators their plans for raising the money, and raise it by November.         
	The verdict was far more upbeat than many in the industry had feared when the tests were first announced in February. The banks that came up short will have to raise much less than some analysts had expected a few days ago.        
	The stress tests were aimed at estimating how much each bank would lose if the economic downturn proved even deeper than currently expected. But regulators gave the banks a break by letting them bolster their capital with unusually strong first-quarter profits.        
	Despite an almost tangible sense of relief among the banks and investors, the report card is unlikely to silence an intense debate over whether the US Treasury Department and the US Federal Reserve let the banks off too easily and glossed over their problems.         
	Under the worst-case assumptions  an unemployment rate of 10.3 per cent next year, an economic contraction of 3.3 per cent this year and a 22 per cent further decline in housing prices  the losses by the 19 banks could total $600 billion this year and next, or 9.1 per cent of the banks total loans, regulators concluded. That rate of loss would be higher than any other since 1921.        
	Bank of America was told it would have to come up with $34.9 billion. Wells Fargo will have to find $13.7 billion. Citigroup will have to produce $5.5 billion, on top of the $52.5 billion it had planned to acquire by letting the Treasury become its biggest single shareholder.

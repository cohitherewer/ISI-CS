The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Tatas to check out of Sydney Blue
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Tatas to check out of Sydney Blue
          PIYA SINGH                                            
	Mumbai, Nov. 23: The Tatas have decided to put the Blue Sydney  a 100-room boutique hotel  on the block.        
	It is learnt that Indian Hotels Company, which runs the Taj chain of hotels, resorts and palaces, has started discussions with some of the worlds leading hospitality groups to sell this property.        
	The Tatas had acquired Blue Sydney, which ranks among the top hotels in Sydney, in December 2005. The sale of the hotel will mark the exit of Indian Hotels from Australia.        
	The $71-billion Tata group-owned company had bought the hotel  which was formerly known as the W  for Aus $36 million from the Harilela family of Hong Kong.        
	Blue Sydney is a relatively new property  less than 10 years old  compared with several of the hotels that the group owns or manages overseas such as the 80-year-old Taj Boston or the legendary Pierre in New York that first opened its doors in 1930.        
	Despite repeated attempts, Indian Hotels was unavailable for comment on the latest development.        
	There could be several reasons why Indian Hotels wants to put up the Blue Sydney for sale, said an analyst. The company  which has a significant overseas presence managing hotels such as The Pierre in New York, the Taj Boston and the Crown Plaza London-St. James  may find that a 100-room boutique property in Sydney does not really add significant value to its portfolio.        
	Besides, Indian Hotels has spent a reasonable amount of money in upgrading some of its overseas properties, buying new hotels in India and has made other overseas investments.        
	Over the past few years since it acquired Blue Sydney, the company has invested $100 million in renovating The Pierre, New York that boasts of the Le Caprice restaurant, and buying a boutique property in San Francisco called The Campton Place for $58 million.        
	In 2007, an Indian Hotels subsidiary raised more than $300 million through loans to acquire a stake in luxury operator Orient-Express. It also bought the 273-room Ritz-Carlton, Boston for $170 million in November 2006 that was later renamed as the Taj Boston.        
	At home, Indian Hotels acquired a stake in a company that holds the long-term sublease for landmark Sea Rock in Bandra, Mumbai for Rs 680 crore in June.         
	This deal will give the hotel chain a chance to develop a sea-facing integrated hospitality development, including a convention centre, retail and commercial operations.         
	At Indian Hotels annual general meeting in August, chairman Ratan Tata said the hotel chain would look at debt and equity to raise funds to meet the companys expansion plans.         
	The Taj chain is getting ready to reopen parts of the terrorist-ravaged heritage wing of its Mumbai property on the anniversary of the 26/11 attacks. Later, it plans to open a new property in Cape Town.

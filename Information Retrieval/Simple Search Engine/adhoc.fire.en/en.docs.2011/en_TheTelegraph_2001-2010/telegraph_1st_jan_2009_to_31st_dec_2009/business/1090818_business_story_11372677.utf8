The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Japan joy fails to lift mood
                                                                                                               Japan joy fails to lift mood
          HIROKO TABUCHI                              
	Tokyo, Aug. 17: Japans economy rebounded in the latest quarter for the first time in a year, signalling the possible end of the countrys deepest recession since Second World War. The worlds second-largest economy had plunged into recession last year.         
	A turnaround in exports and a vast fiscal stimulus programme had helped Japan produce a 0.9 per cent economic expansion in the three months that ended on June 30, government figures showed, equivalent to an annualised growth of 3.7 per cent.        
	A 1.2 per cent growth in public demand helped offset a 1.3 per cent fall in demand from the private sector, the data showed. Overall domestic demand fell 0.7 per cent from the previous quarter.         
	The results were very positive, said Takuji Aida, senior economist at UBS Securities Japan. Its true, Japan would not have achieved growth without government stimulus. Still, the data show that inventory adjustment is all but over, and we can expect growth going forward, Aida said.        
	Still, the outlook for Japan remains unclear, and some analysts question whether the economy can sustain this recovery after stimulus measures at home and elsewhere run their course. Falling employment and wages are also expected to weigh on consumer spending for some time.        
	Japans jobless rate hit a six-year high of 5.4 per cent, and wages showed a record drop in June on an annual basis, dragging down consumer spending. Weak demand, coupled with falling oil prices, have put pressure on prices here, raising fears of prolonged and damaging deflation.        
	With the factors driving the current rebound being temporary in nature, a self-sustaining recovery is still not in sight, Ryutaro Kono, Tokyo-based economist for BNP Paribas, said.        
	The latest growth recoups only a small fraction of the 8.8 per cent the Japanese economy has lost since peaking in early 2008, he said. Private capital investment and real estate values also remain weak, economists say.         
	Although production activity has increased with the turnaround in exports, we have yet to see active production backed by capital investment, Kyohei Morita, chief economist for Japan at Barclays Capital, wrote in a note.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | CDMA gets portability boost
                                                                                                               CDMA gets portability boost
          JAYATI GHOSE                              
	New Delhi, Jan. 4: The department of telecom (DoT) will assess the validity of letting CDMA players with GSM licences start number portability.        
	Such a proposal was mooted earlier but shelved following opposition from GSM players such as Bharti Airtel and Vodafone.        
	Internal mobile number portability will allow CDMA firms such as Reliance Communications (R-Com), Tata Teleservices and Bharat Sanchar Nigam Limited who hold GSM licences to shift their subscribers from one technology to the other.         
	Analysts said internal portability would enable dual technology operators to retain their subscriber base.        
	With CDMA players planning to kick off GSM services, the DoT thinks it will benefit consumers if internal portability is initiated, said sources. While R-Com has already launched GSM services, Tata Teleservices plans to follow suit.        
	Number portability allows users to change service providers without having to take new numbers. The service is expected to increase competition and encourage companies to offer better service and lower tariff.         
	At present, if customers are not satisfied, they have to change their number before shifting to a new operator, leading to inconvenience.        
	According to the Cellular Operators Association of India (COAI), which represents the interests of the GSM players, If internal number portability is allowed, it will make the audit of spectrum use impossible. There could be manipulation in the payment of spectrum charges, resulting in a huge loss to the government.        
	The COAI fears that such a policy will lead to the manipulation of subscriber figures for additional spectrum. For instance, a company can ask the government for spectrum after moving a large number of users from CDMA to GSM.        
	According to the guidelines for number portability, a central agency will operate the database required to implement the scheme.         
	However, for internal number portability, operators can bypass the agency.

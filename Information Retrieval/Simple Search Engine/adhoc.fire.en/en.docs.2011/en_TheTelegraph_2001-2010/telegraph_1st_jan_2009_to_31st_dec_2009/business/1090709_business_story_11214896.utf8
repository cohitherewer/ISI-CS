The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Stocks take a beating 
                                                                                                               Stocks take a beating 
                                          
	Mumbai, July 8 (PTI): The governments pep talk had little impact on the bourses today, which tumbled after a recovery yesterday.         
	The sensex ended at a six-week low of 13769.15, pulled down by global weaknesses and heavy capital outflows. Indications of an early roadmap for divestment and a partial recovery in the Asian and European markets failed to lift sentiments.         
	The sensex ended with a net fall of 401.30 points or 2.83 per cent from Tuesdays close of 14170.45. The 50-share Nifty slumped 123.25 points, or 2.93 per cent, to close at 4078.90 from Tuesdays close of 4202.15.

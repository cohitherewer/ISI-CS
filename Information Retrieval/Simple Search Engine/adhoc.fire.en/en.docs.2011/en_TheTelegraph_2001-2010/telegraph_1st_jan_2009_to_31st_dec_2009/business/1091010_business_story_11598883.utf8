                                                                                                               Anil firm agrees to pay gas margin
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Stratrgy shift                                  
	Mumbai, Oct. 9: Reliance Infrastructure  the Anil Dhirubhai Ambani Group company  has agreed to pay a marketing margin under protest to Reliance Industries for the supply of natural gas from the KG-D6 gasfield.        
	Last month, Reliance Infrastructure had told the Mukesh Ambani flagship that it would not pay the unauthorised levy. Reliance Infrastructure had earlier paid $0.135 per million British thermal unit in marketing costs to RIL for over four months.        
	As a result, RIL sent a notice to the Anil Ambani company in which it threatened to suspend gas supplies.        
	In a letter dated October 7, the Anil Ambani firm told RIL that it had instructed its bank to effect full payment of the invoice amount, including the marketing margin element.        
	It also requested RIL to withdraw the suspension notice dated September 28 and confirm immediate resumption of gas supply to its plant in Andhra Pradesh.        
	In its letter, Reliance Infrastructure reiterated that the marketing margin being levied by RIL is unauthorised and uncalled for and is not in accord with the empowered group of ministers (e-GoM)/government decisions.        
	The company also simultaneously wrote a letter to the ministry of petroleum and natural gas stating that the marketing margin charged by RIL was unauthorised.        
	As you will appreciate, neither RIL was to undertake any marketing exercise for entering into gas supply agreements nor the price formula approved by government of India through eGoM enables levy of any marketing margin by RIL, it said.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Jan. 23: The Satyam scam was a setback for Indian business as well as for the economy at large, according to Suresh Tendulkar, chairman of the Economic Advisory Council to the Prime Minister.        
	He said the scam could be an irritant to firms trying to acquire assets and secure finances abroad. It has undercut confidence amongst customers, investors and employees in the industry, he said.        
	However unfair it may seem, Indian businesses will now have to go the extra mile to counteract the negative effect of being tarred with the same brush.

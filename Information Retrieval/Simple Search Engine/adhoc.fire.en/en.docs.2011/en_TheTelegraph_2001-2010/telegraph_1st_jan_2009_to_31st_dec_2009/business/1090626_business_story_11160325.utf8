The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | AI unions oppose wage cut
                                                                                                               AI unions oppose wage cut
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, June 25: Talks between the Air India management and unions over a Rs 500-crore cut in the wage bill have reached a stalemate with unions refusing pay cuts.         
	Union representatives told chairman Arvind Jadhav that they were unwilling to accept any pay or allowance cuts.         
	The airline has now set up a turnaround committee comprising management and union representatives.         
	Air India has asked the unions to make a presentation identifying areas where the company can cut costs.        
	The unions have asked the management to delay buying new aircraft as they feel the loans for the purchase have contributed significantly to the carriers current plight.         
	Air India has inducted around 10 Boeing 777s and 12 Boeing 737-800s over the last two years for flying overseas. However, the global recession has taken a toll on travel, resulting in many of these planes flying half empty.        
	This year, Air India is expected to buy 7 Boeing 777s which are also for foreign routes. It would need to pay Rs 8,165.44 crore to pay for them in this financial year.         
	The management has decided to sell planes that are more than 15 years old to raise money. Analysts estimate that the airline can sell up to 25 such aircraft but doubt whether it will be able to find buyers or get a good price given the slump in global aviation.         
	The government yesterday said it would help Air India by pumping in more equity and arranging for soft loans but wanted the airline to come up with a financial and organisational restructuring plan.         
	Air India has been asked to come up with a detailed restructuring plan within a month and submit it to a panel of secretaries, headed by the cabinet secretary.        
	The ailing carrier has sought an equity infusion of about Rs 1,250 crore and soft loans of about Rs 3,000 crore.         
	It has been facing a cash crunch on the back of mounting losses which are likely to be Rs 4,300 crore for 2008-09 nearly double of what it was in the previous year.        
	A combination of high fuel prices, fewer passengers and the global financial meltdown has left the airline in the red.         
	The Indian airline industry is estimated to have run up losses of up to Rs 10,000 crore this fiscal.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Hyderabad, Jan. 12: The sleuths in the state criminal investigation department (CID) have started grilling two auditors working for Price Waterhouse  S. Gopalakrishnan and Srinivas Talluri  who had signed the Satyam balance sheets over the past few years.        
	At a later stage, a team sent by capital market watchdog Sebi is likely to interrogate them as well.         
	Gopalakrishnan had signed the balance sheet for 2005-06 and a couple of years before that. Talluri signed off on the latest balance sheet for the year ended March 31, 2008.        
	In identically worded statements, both the auditors had said they had not come across any instance of fraud on or by the company. The auditors remuneration to Price Waterhouse jumped sharply by 219 per cent from Rs 1.15 crore in the year ended March 31, 2006 to Rs 3.67 crore in the year ended March 31, 2008. There was no apparent reason for this surge.        
	The remuneration had also jumped 77 per cent from Rs 65 lakh in the year ended 2005 to Rs 1.15 crore in 2006.         
	The Institute of Chartered Accountants of India would set up a special committee by tomorrow to investigate the role of Price Waterhouse.

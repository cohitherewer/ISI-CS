                                                                                                               State Bank lowers deposit rates
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          TRIM FACTOR                                  
	Mumbai, June 13: The State Bank of India (SBI) today slashed deposit rates across all maturities by 25 basis points in an indication that a reduction in lending rates is round the corner.        
	The revised rates will be effective from June 15.         
	This is the second cut in deposit rates by the countrys largest bank in less than a month.         
	On May 13, the SBI brought down the deposit rates by 25-50 basis points. Since April, the bank had cut interest rates on deposits of various maturities by 75-100 basis points.        
	With the cost of funds coming down over the last couple of months, banking experts said, the SBI could bring down lending rates soon.         
	SBI chairman . P. Bhatt had recently indicated that lending rates could be lowered before the end of this month.        
	The SBI today said it would offer an interest rate of 3 per cent on deposits in the maturity bucket of 15 days to 45 days against 3.25 per cent earlier. Similarly, the interest rate on deposits of 46-90 days will stand at 4 per cent compared with 4.25 per cent, while for the 91-180-day term, the rate will be 5.25 per cent against 5.50 per cent earlier.        
	For a tenure of 181 days to less than a year, the new rate will be 6.25 per cent, while for a period of one year to less than two years, the rate has been revised to 7 per cent from 7.25 per cent.        
	Deposit rates on two years to less than 1,000 days will be at 7.25 per cent, for 1,000 days at 7.50 per cent, and for 1,001 days to less than three years, the rate will be 7.25 per cent.        
	For a term of three years to less than five years, the rate also stands at 7.25 per cent.        
	The bank will offer an interest rate of 7.75 per cent for deposits between five years to less than eight years. Interest rates on deposits of eight years and up to 10 years will now be at 8 per cent against 8.25 per cent earlier.        
	Despite successive reductions, the deposit rates offered by the SBI are better than those offered by the Punjab National Bank (PNB), the second largest public sector bank which now has the lowest prime lending rate (PLR).         
	For instance, in the maturity bucket of 1 year to less than 2 years, PNB offers an interest rate of 6.50 per cent against the SBIs 7 per cent.

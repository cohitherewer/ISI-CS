                                                                                                               NHPC sets August date for flotation
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Fund raiser                                  
	New Delhi, July 8: State-run NHPC will be the first to test the market next month as it plans to come out with an initial public offering to mop up around Rs 5,000 crore. The NHPC issue will be followed by Oil Indias public float in September.        
	The Union Budget 2009-10 had estimated that proceeds from proposed divestments in 2009-10 would be Rs 1,120 crore. Other companies planning to hit the capital market are Rail India Technical and Economic Services, Cochin Shipyard, Telecommunications Consultants India, Manganese Ore India, Rashtriya Ispat Nigam and Satluj Jal Vidyut Nigam.        
	As part of the divestment process, NHPC will be offering 10 per cent of its equity, while the government will offload a 5 per cent stake. NHPCs IPO will come in August; the company has already started the roadshows, power secretary H.S. Brahma said today.        
	The power firm plans to issue fresh equity of Rs 1,670 crore through the IPO, comprising 167 crore shares of face value of Rs 10 each. The shares will be offered at a premium to be decided through the book-building process. Sources said a premium of at least Rs 20 apiece would be charged.        
	Oil India plans to come out with its IPO in September. Sources said the final timing of the IPO would depend on market conditions. As of now, it is slated for the first week of September, sources said.        
	An 11 per cent fresh equity will be sold in the Oil India IPO, while the government will divest 10 per cent of its stake. Of the IPO proceeds, two-thirds will go to NHPC and Oil India and the remaining to the government. Finance ministry officials said the government was likely to fetch Rs 3,000-3,500 crore from the two issues.        
	The Economic Survey for 2008-09 has also recommended that Rs 25,000 crore should be garnered annually through sale of government equity in public sector undertakings.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | October date for gas case
                                                                                                               October date for gas case
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Long wait                                  
	New Delhi, Aug. 28: The Supreme Court has deferred the final hearing of the RIL-RNRL gas case to October 20. The court was scheduled to hear the case on September 1.        
	The hearing has been postponed so that the case may be taken up by a bench headed by Chief Justice K.G. Balakrishnan. The Chief Justice is busy on September 1 as he will be heading a constitutional bench on entry tax imposed by states on the same day.        
	The court was slated to start hearing the cross-appeals among the Ambani brothers and the Union government on the issue of the supply of natural gas to Anil Ambani-owned RNRL by Mukesh Ambanis RIL.        
	A bench comprising Chief Justice K.G. Balakrishnan, Justice P.S. Sathasivam and Justice V.H. Chauhan fixed October 20 for hearing.        
	While senior counsel Harish Salve, representing RIL, suggested the date, the counsel for both RNRL as well as the government said that they did not have any objection. We will start on that day and will finish as soon as possible, Salve said.        
	The bench directed all the parties to file their documents, including responses and rejoinders, by that date.        
	The Anil Ambani firm had moved the apex court for the implementation of the Bombay High Court order that had asked RIL to sell 28 million cubic meters of gas per day at $2.34 per million British thermal units for 17 years to RNRL.        
	The special leave petition by the government in the Supreme Court said the high court order had given a private agreement between the Ambanis precedence over the governments right to formulate a gas utilisation policy. The pricing and utilisation policies have been approved by the empowered group of ministers.        
	Continuing with the war of words, RIL in a letter to petroleum secretary R.S. Pandey said the allegation of gold plating of investments in KG D-6 at this juncture could affect the governments effort to attract investments in oil and gas under the eighth round of new exploration and licensing policy (Nelp-VIII).        
	What makes the current campaign even more serious is that it has been launched not only when the matter is sub-judice, but also seems timed to sabotage the governments efforts to get investments under Nelp-VIII, RILs oil business chief P.M.S. Prasad wrote to the oil secretary.

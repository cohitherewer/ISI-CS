          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                            
	Mumbai, Dec. 14: Mukesh Ambanis hopes of acquiring LyondellBasell  the global petrochemicals giant  appear to have faded after the existing management put together a $2.5-billion rescue package which has the backing of the companys leading creditors.        
	The fresh rescue package, which trumps Reliance Industries non-binding cash offer made on November 21 to acquire a controlling interest in LyondellBasell, will be submitted to Judge Robert Gerber of the US bankruptcy court of Manhattan on Tuesday to settle a $21-billion lawsuit filed by the chemical giants creditors.        
	The creditors, which include banks such as Citigroup and UBS AG, will receive $300 million when LyondellBasell emerges from bankruptcy protection.        
	These creditors had filed a lawsuit claiming $21 billion in debt that LyondellBasell had taken after the merger of Basell AF and Lyondell Chemical Co in 2007.        
	The fresh rescue plan provides for a cash infusion of $2.5 billion and the transfer of the company to the management and creditors. Under the rescue plan, the management will try to pay back $2-$4 billion loans that were taken after it went bankrupt. The plan will also try to address a section of old loans or those that were taken before LyondellBasell went bankrupt.        
	However, the rescue plan has met with strong opposition from a section of unsecured creditors who hold a chunk of the debt that the global petrochemical company has taken on its books. The unsecured creditors are determined to put up a fight in court to stall acceptance of the rescue plan, giving the Ambanis a faint hope of pulling off the biggest overseas buyout by an Indian company. The rescue package has to be approved by the US court and sources said RIL was still hoping to persuade creditors to back its proposal.        
	While a RIL spokesperson declined to comment on the developments, sources said, RIL cannot really buy a company that is not up for sale.                    
	The $28-billion group had built a cash chest of over $4 billion to finance the buyout of LyondellBasell which had revenues of about $50 billion before it filed for bankruptcy in early 2009.        
	Sources close to the development also said RIL had not yet conducted a full-fledged due diligence of the assets owned by LyondellBasell.

                                                                                                               Satyam probe finds auditors guilty
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          TRUTH UNFOLDS                                  
	New Delhi, April 17: The Serious Frauds Investigation Office (SFIO) has held Price Waterhouse (PW) guilty of the falsification of accounts in Satyam, while giving a clean chit to the independent directors.        
	In its over 14,000-page report submitted to the government after a three-month-long investigation, the SFIO said the auditors of Price Waterhouse were aware of Satyam founder B. Ramalinga Rajus misdemeanours but kept silent.        
	It alleged that the two PW partners working on Satyams financials  S. Gopalakrishnan and Talluri Srinivas were guilty of account falsification.         
	The auditing firm reacted today by saying the two Satyam audit partners and PW India were victims of that fraud.        
	Gopalakrishnan and Talluri are in a Hyderabad jail and being grilled by various agencies, including the CBI.        
	The SFIO said that the two auditors were involved in the fraud by feigning ignorance about their ability to question the authenticity of the documents provided to them.         
	The auditors are supposed to get the confirmation from banks and others. They cannot follow everything said by the management for so many years, sources said.        
	According to the probe, the auditors knew of the audit failure through a report generated by Satyams own systems department in 2007.         
	The report pointed out that fake invoices could be generated in the system, but the auditors continued to verify the audit system as correct.         
	The SFIO said the four independent directors  Vinod Dham, Mangalam Srinivasan, K.G. Palepu and T. R. Prasad  had no knowledge about the accounting fudge that took place allegedly at the behest of Raju, his brother and other top executives of the software services firm.         
	The SFIO also questioned the then whole-time director and senior executive Ram Mynampati but found no clear evidence linking him to the scam, sources said.

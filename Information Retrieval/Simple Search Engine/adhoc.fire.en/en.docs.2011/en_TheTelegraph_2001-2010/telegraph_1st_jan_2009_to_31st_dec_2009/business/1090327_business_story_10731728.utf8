The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Rivals refuse to lose sleep over Nano
                                                                                                               Rivals refuse to lose sleep over Nano
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              (From top)R.C. Bhargava and Pawan Munjal in New Delhi on Thursday (AP)				                                 
	New Delhi, March 26: Maruti Suzuki India today said the Tata Nano might have a marginal impact on the sales of its entry-level Maruti 800 but ruled out a cut in prices.        
	Two-wheeler makers Hero Honda, Bajaj Auto and TVS Motors, however, said the Rs 1-lakh car would have no impact on their businesses.        
	Maruti Suzuki chairman R.C. Bhargava said, It (Nano) may have a marginal impact on the M800 segment, but we dont have any plan to cut its price or enter the Nano segment. He was speaking on the sidelines of the Confederation of Indian Industrys annual session.        
	Asked if the company had plans to counter the Nano, he said, The Nano is in a different segment and we are in a different segment. He added that the Tata car would definitely help in expanding the market.        
	While Marutis sales have been good in this quarter, Bhargava refused to comment on the future, saying issues such as elections, policies of the new government, interest rates and commodity prices would have to be factored in. Maruti, whose M800 was the smallest car in India so far, will feel the pinch after the Nano hits the market in July.         
	Launched earlier this week, the Nano will come in three variants and will be made at Pantnagar in Uttarakhand.        
	However, two-wheeler makers seem to be unfazed by the Nano.         
	Nothing much has changed since the unveiling of the Nano at the Auto Expo (in 2008) except for the announcement of the prices. I still maintain it is not going to have any real impact on two-wheelers, said Pawan Munjal, managing director and chief executive officer of Hero Honda Motors.        
	He said going by the price there was a fair difference between the Nano and two-wheelers.        
	The price of the Nano is closer to a high-end bike, the buyer for which is not a car customer, he said.         
	Maintenance costs, too, will be higher.        
	However, there may be some two-wheeler buyers who will be attracted to the Nano.        
	Two-wheeler makers feel the Nano will create a new segment and hence they will not be affected.        
	There will be no major impact on two-wheelers. It (Nano) will create its own segment, said Venu Srinivasan, chairman of TVS Motor.        
	Bajaj Auto chairman Rahul Bajaj said, I dont see a Pulsar buyer going to the Nano. He wants a Bajaj Pulsar, not the Nano.

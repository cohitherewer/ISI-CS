                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Bharti seeks control of Bangla operator
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                                            
	New Delhi, Dec. 16: Sunil Mittal-promoted Bharti Airtel is looking to buy a majority stake in Bangladeshs Warid Telecom from the UAE-based Abu Dhabi Group.        
	Ali Tahir, Abu Dhabi Groups chief commercial officer, told reporters that the group expected the deal to be completed by mid-January, with Bharti gaining management control of Warid.        
	Bharti will get 70 per cent in Warid, while Abu Dhabi Group will retain the remaining shares, said Tahir.        
	Sources said Bharti Airtel and Abu Dhabi Group have sought approval from the Bangladesh Telecommunication Regulatory Commission. Any stake sale will require the permission of the Bangladesh telecom regulator, the sources said.        
	However, Bharti Enterprises, the parent of Bharti Airtel, declined to confirm the deal. We keep evaluating international expansion opportunities. However, at this point, we do not have anything definite to share, said the company spokesperson.        
	Bharti Enterprises deputy group CEO and managing director Akhil Gupta said, We have always been interested in Bangladesh and other countries in the Saarc (South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation) region.        
	Besides India, Bharti operates in Sri Lanka, Seychelles and British Channel Islands, which is off the French coast.        
	Sources said the value of the deal could be around $900 million. Bharti has also submitted a $300-million initial investment plan to Bangladeshs telecom commission which will be implemented after the deal is signed, they said.        
	Bharti has been looking for opportunities in emerging markets after the New Delhi-based company called off talks for a proposed $23-billion merger with South Africas MTN Group in September.         
	An acquisition will help Bharti get customers from a neighbouring country as increased competition trims earnings growth at home, said analysts.         
	Launched in May 2007, Warid is the fourth largest mobile phone operator in Bangladesh. At the end of October, Warid had nearly 3 million subscribers, out of nearly 52 million in Bangladesh.

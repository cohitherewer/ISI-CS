The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Rally casts cloud on owners open offers
                                                                                                               Rally casts cloud on owners open offers
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Mumbai, June 7: Promoters planning to raise their stakes in companies through open offers have a tough job in hand. With the stock markets on an upward spiral, investors may not bite the bait unless they get a good premium on the ruling market price.        
	There are at least three offers this month from foreign promoters looking to increase their stake in local units. Overseas parents want to improve their shareholding in Pfizer India, Novartis India and Ciba India.        
	The open offer for Ciba India shares opened on June 4, while that for Pfizer will commence on June 15. The offer for Novartis India shares has started on May 20 and will close tomorrow.        
	Mylan Laboratories recently announced that it had accepted a discovered price of Rs 211 per share (exit price) established by the reverse book building process for its delisting offer in Matrix Laboratories.        
	Mylan may have got a good response from investors, but market circles aver the path for others may not be as smooth because of the price factor.        
	Stock values have risen and investors are hoping there is still some rally left. Investors, particularly at the retail end, will tender their shares only if the companies offer a good premium to the current market price. The price should be extremely attractive, an analyst said.        
	In the Novartis offer, its parent raised the offer price to Rs 450 per share from its earlier offer of Rs 351 per share.        
	The offer price was apparently raised because the company did not get a good response from the shareholders, the analyst said.        
	On Friday, the Novartis share closed at Rs 420.45, a discount to the offer price. But, Arun Kejriwal, director of KRIS and an investor in the company, says he is unlikely to tender his shares in the open offer.        
	I got numerous calls asking me to tender my shares. However, I am unlikely to do so. People are looking for a good premium, he said.

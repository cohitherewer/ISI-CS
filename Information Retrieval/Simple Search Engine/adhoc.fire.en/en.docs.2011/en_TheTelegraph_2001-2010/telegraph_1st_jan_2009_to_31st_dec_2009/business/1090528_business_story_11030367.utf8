	New Delhi, May 27: Finance minister Pranab Mukherjee wants state-run banks to reduce their interest rates in line with the falling cost of funds, prompting several banks to announce plans of lowering interest rates.         
	Mukherjee said he would be meeting bankers soon and ask them to step up lending to industry.        
	The cost and speed with which finance can be accessed remain a matter of concern. One of the first steps I propose to take is to meet the bankers and convince them to a more benign plan of action, he said.        
	I expect that they (banks) will take advantage of the monetary policy, which the RBI has announced from time to time and I will have to see how the credit is made available quickly and to what extent it can be made cheap, the finance minister said.        
	Taking a cue from the government, three state-run banks  Corporation Bank, Union Bank of India and Bank of Maharashtra  today said they might lower their prime lending rate by 25-50 basis points soon.        
	The finance minister is scheduled to meet the chiefs of public sector banks on June 12.        
	Other PSU banks, including the State Bank of India, the Bank of Baroda, Canara and Allahabad Bank, are also planning to cut lending rates by 100-150 points.        
	At present, state-run banks charge about 10-12.5 per cent from home loan borrowers and 11.5-12.5 per cent from car buyers, while private lenders charge at least 1-4 per cent more.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | ACC expansion on track 
                                                                                                               ACC expansion on track 
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                           FUND PUSH                                  
	Mumbai, April 8: ACC, the countrys largest cement maker, is investing close to Rs 2,900 crore over two years to expand capacity.         
	By 2010, capacity will rise to over 30 million tonnes from 22.4 million tonnes.         
	There is no slowdown in the projects that are being implemented. Our capex (capital expenditure) plan for 2009 is about Rs 1,600 crore and for 2010, it is Rs 1,300 crore, chairman N.S. Sekhsaria said.         
	Sekhsaria was addressing the shareholders at the companys 73rd annual general meeting.         
	He said the expansion at Bargarh in Orissa should be completed by the middle of this year.         
	ACC is expanding capacity to 2.3 million tonnes at Bargarh and setting up a captive power unit.        
	It will take up its expansion plans in Karnataka in phases, including clinker capacity expansion at Wadi and two new grinding plants.         
	A 7,000-tonne-per-day clinker line and an additional 25MW captive power plant at Chanda in Maharashtra should be ready by 2010.         
	Sekhsaria said the first two quarters of the current year were expected to be reasonably good because of the governments focus on infrastructure and low-cost housing along with good retail demand from semi-urban and rural markets.         
	Higher government support prices for agriculture, the rural employment guarantee scheme and the Rs 60,000-crore farm loan waiver should give a boost to the countrys rural economy.         
	No business is without risks, and all sectors of the industry are vulnerable to some cyclical ups and downs in the long term. ACC is strongly positioned to negotiate these uncertainties, he said.         
	ACC produced 20.83 million tonnes in 2008, up 4.6 per cent over 2007. It increased its market share to 12.2 per cent from 11.8 per cent in the previous year.         
	Last year, ACC had to live with fluctuations in input prices. Coal prices, for instance, are at $70 per tonne compared with $150 in June.

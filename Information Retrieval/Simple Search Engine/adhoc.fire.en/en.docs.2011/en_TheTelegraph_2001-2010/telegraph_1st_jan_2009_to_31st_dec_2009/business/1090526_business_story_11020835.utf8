	New Delhi, May 25: Work on this fiscals full budget started in full swing with Pranab Mukherjee taking charge of the finance ministry today.  
	Mukherjee gave instructions that he would like the budget to focus on industries hit by the global slowdown and social sector projects, which could improve living conditions and pay political dividends. Top officials said Mukherjee would like to spend 2 per cent of GDP on healthcare and 6 per cent of GDP on education.  
	Also on the cards is a social sector scheme promising cheap grain to the poor and the extension of the rural job guarantee scheme to urban areas.  
	Mukherjee had earlier said, All economic issues will be addressed. My priority is to put the economy back on track.  
	A series of meetings were held with top officials of the ministry today, including one with the revenue department.   
	The governments stimulus packages and the many social sector schemes need to be supported by high revenues.  
	Direct taxes in the last fiscal fell short of the target by Rs 6,000 crore, though they were higher than previous years collections by Rs 26,000 crore.  
	One can expect very few tax sops except to stressed sectors such as infotech, textiles, gems and jewellery, which need to be helped out. The emphasis will be on better collections, said senior revenue department officials.   
	There will also be a huge spending plan for infrastructure, and this is expected to be a big stimulus package by itself which can see industry reviving and help to pull up both direct and indirect taxes.   
	Officials also discussed plans to recapitalise public sector banks to meet Basel II norms. They are proposing to pump over Rs 16,000 crore into banks over a period of time, taking advantage of a $3bn (Rs 14,000 crore) credit line being offered by the World Bank.  
	Finance ministry officials said they could go in for recapitalising all PSU banks, which had a capital-to-risk-adequacy ratio (CAR) of 10-12 per cent.   
	The CAR is an indicator of bank health; whenever it deteriorates, banks either raise more capital or sell off risky assets.   
	Most Indian banks have CAR higher than the Basel and RBI norms of 8 per cent and 9 per cent, respectively.  
	However, capital infusion is necessary in some of them as they will be lending more in the future. Three banks  Uco, Vijaya Bank and the Central Bank of India  have already received Rs 3,400 crore.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | More airports on fee radar
                                                                                                               More airports on fee radar
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                          On course                                  
	New Delhi, April 16: The Airports Authority of India (AAI) plans to slap a user fee on passengers flying out of the nine airports it is upgrading.         
	The nine airports are Calcutta, Chennai, Dibrugarh, Goa, Thiruvananthapuram, Udaipur, Jaipur, Trichy and Ahmedabad.         
	It wants to charge Rs 200-250 from domestic passengers and Rs 1,000 from international travellers, wherever applicable, departing from these airports, in line with the levy in Delhi, Mumbai, Bangalore and Hyderabad.        
	However, with the election code of conduct in place, the government is unlikely to approve the proposal now.        
	Airports charge a development fee from passengers to recover the cost of construction and maintenance, a move that has been criticised by many.         
	In Mumbai, the GVK group, which upgraded the airport, charges Rs 100 as user fee on each outbound domestic passenger and Rs 600 on each international passenger.        
	The GMR-managed Delhi airport charges Rs 200 from a domestic passenger, while it is Rs 1,000 for an international passenger.        
	Our purpose is not to tax the travelling public, but to raise cash to meet the shortfall in carrying out the modernisation work at these airports, said sources.        
	The development fee will help the AAI overcome the shortage of funds required to upgrade the airports.        
	Aviation is grappling with falling income, with the slowdown hitting passenger traffic.         
	In the three months to March, the number of passengers on domestic routes have fallen 12 per cent.

                                                                                                               Stage set for Satyam open bid     -  CLB paves way for strategic investor
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                                                  
	New Delhi, Feb. 19: The Company Law Board (CLB) today permitted Satyam Computer to induct one or more strategic investors through open bidding and raise funds using the preferential allotment route.        
	It permitted the tainted IT firm to raise its authorised share capital to Rs 280 crore, comprising 140 crore shares of Rs 2 each, from Rs 160 crore now. Shares can be allotted, preferentially, at par or at a premium, for which the company needs to pass a resolution.         
	In the interest of the company, its employees, shareholders, customers and in the larger public interest, further induction of long-term funds through a strategic investor is necessary, said S. Balasubramanian, chairman of the CLB.        
	In its order, the CLB said the bidding should be overseen by a retired judge of the Supreme Court.        
	Sources said at least 12 bidders were in the fray, including Larsen amp; Toubro, which holds around 12 per cent in Satyam, HCL Technologies, the Hindujas, Tech Mahindra and the B.K. Modi-led Spice Corp.        
	The CLB has asked the Satyam board to determine the bidding process.         
	Officials in the department of company affairs said investors should be chosen based on multiple criteria. These should include global and national reputation, business ethics and financial strength of the partner.         
	The nature of the bidding has sparked a debate, with the proposal of an e-auction meeting with vigorous opposition from L amp;T. Satyam is not a standard commodity or a vegetable that can be bought or sold in an e-auction, L amp;Ts president for operations J. P. Nayak had said last week.        
	If the open-offer route was followed, L amp;T would be at an advantage because of its 12 per cent stake.        
	Hinduja group CFO Prabal Banerji said they would take a final call after assessing Satyams valuation through a due-diligence exercise. Without a valuation, making a bid will not be proper.         
	Spice Corp chairman B. K. Modi said, Suitors are likely to bid for the entire 51 per cent in the company. He said the price could go up to Rs 60 per share, much higher than the closing price of Rs 46.25 today.        
	Spice will hold a board meeting tomorrow to finalise its plans.        
	For the strategic investor, the problem is the class action lawsuits in the US against the company as it will have to tackle them.        
	In addition, the CLB has directed Satyam that it must comply with the takeover provisions of Sebi, for which it must seek permission from the market regulator.        
	Last week, Sebi had said that it was willing to relax the open offer terms on a case-by-case basis, raising the possibility of shares being sold at prices that reflect the current quotes.         
	Satyam share prices had plunged following the admission of a Rs 7,100-crore fraud by company founder B. Ramalinga Raju.        
	Yesterday, the company had moved the CLB for permission to conduct an auction for the strategic investor.        
	The Lok Sabha today did not take up for discussion the state of affairs at the company. It has decided to deliberate on the issue on Wednesday.

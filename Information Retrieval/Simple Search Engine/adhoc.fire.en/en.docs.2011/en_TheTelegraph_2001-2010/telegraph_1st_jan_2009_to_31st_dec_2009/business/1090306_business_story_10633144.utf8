          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                             
	Mumbai, March 5: RBI rate cuts and falling inflation had little impact on stocks as heavy selling pulled down the sensex by 248.57 points, or 2.94 per cent, to 8197.92        
	Sustained selling in shares also took a toll on the rupee which fell 23 paise to 51.78 against the dollar. A firm dollar overseas also added to the selling pressure.        
	It is the lower economic growth which is causing more worry among investors. Moreover, with elections round the corner, there is this uncertainty factor. Therefore, many investors, including the FIIs, are either staying away or pulling their money out, an analyst with a foreign brokerage said.         
	The benchmark index opened at 8535.03, higher than the last close of 8446.49. The selling then started and intensified towards the noon.        
	The BSE bankex was the biggest loser, falling 4.15 per cent. ICICI Bank hit a 52-week low and ended 5.2 per cent lower at Rs 269.60.         
	ONGC slipped nearly 2 per cent to Rs 651.85 after Goldman Sachs expressed concerns about corporate governance in the PSU.         
	Some observers were optimistic of a rebound. Going ahead, we may see the indices falling by another 3 per cent or so. However, there could be a bounce back from these levels. Some stocks can be good accumulation for the long term investors, says P. Phani Sekhar, fund manager at Angel Broking.

          SAMBIT SAHA                              
	Calcutta, Nov. 16: Descon has moved Calcutta High Court seeking an injunction on a Company Law Board order that restricts its chances to acquire power generator DPSC Ltd.        
	The CLB ruling will throw Descon out of the race for DPSC if it fails to bid close to the highest bidder.        
	Public sector Andrew Yule and two state-owned insurance companies have put their stake in Descon on the block through a rather unusual two-tier sale process.        
	In the first round, there will be a close bidding involving all the interested parties, including Descon.        
	In the next stage, the highest bidder of the first round will be involved in an open bidding with Descon, which has been offered this privilege on account of being the largest shareholder of DPSC.        
	However, the CLB has ruled that Descon will get the privilege only if the difference between its bid and the highest one is not more than 10 per cent in the first round. Descon has moved the court to waive the 10 per cent restriction, making it eligible to participate in the second round irrespective of the value of its bid in the first round.        
	Yule, the Life Insurance Corporation of India and United India Insurance Co Ltd have a combined holding of 57 per cent in DPSC compared with Descons 32.31 per cent.        
	Yule chairman Kallol Datta said the first round of bidding for the 57 per cent stake would be held on Friday.         
	However, the case will come up for hearing on Wednesday.        
	Descon is arguing that the open bidding will anyway fetch the sellers the best price; the 10 per cent clause will not give them any extra cash advantage.         
	Sajjan Jindals JSW Energy, RPG Enterprises flagship CESC are in the fray for DPSC along with Patton Industries, Indian Power Company Ltd, Raghab Industries and Descon, an IT firm set up by Yule shareholders. The Tatas and Anil Ambanis Reliance Power have submitted expressions of interested but have not attended recent bidder meets.        
	DPSC, formerly Dishergarh Power Supply Corporation, runs a 40MW plant near Asansol in Burdwan. It distributes another 140-150MW by buying power from others.        
	Bidders are attracted by its licensed distribution area of 618 square kilometre in the industry-rich Asansol region.         
	DPSC posted Rs 380 crore turnover in the last fiscal with profit of around Rs 10 crore.

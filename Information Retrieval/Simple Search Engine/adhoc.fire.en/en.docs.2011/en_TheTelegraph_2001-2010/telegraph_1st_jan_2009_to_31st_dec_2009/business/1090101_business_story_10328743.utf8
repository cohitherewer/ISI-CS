The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Fate of M amp;A deals hangs in balance
                                                                                                               Fate of M amp;A deals hangs in balance

	Mumbai, Dec. 31: Deal-makers will be working overtime in the first part of 2009 to quickly wrap up an overhang of big-ticket transactions that they werent able to close this year.        
	These include at least three of the top 10 mergers and acquisitions totalling around $7 billion (See table).         
	However, as the effects of the global credit crisis deepen, there is a possibility of a couple of renegotiations.        
	For most M amp;A deals struck in the second half of 2008, my view is that unless they are signed and sealed, theyre not concluded. Renegotiations happen all the time, said Arun Natarajan, founder of Venture Intelligence, which tracks private equity and venture capital activities in India.        
	Accounting consultancy Grant Thorntons partner Harish H.V. says, Usually, there is a time lag between the date of announcement and closure. However, in these times, the threat of a deal going bad is high, especially if the valuation had been decided much earlier in 2008.        
	Ernst amp; Youngs director Jayesh Desai points to the mayhem in the M amp;A markets overseas. In 2008, M amp;A deals worth $800 billion were scrapped worldwide. In India, too, till the money comes in, a deal cannot be counted as closed.        
	Some of the large deals of 2008 that have not been closed include NTT DoCoMos purchase of a 26 per cent stake in Tata Teleservices for $2.7 billion and Telenors 60 per cent stake acquisition in Unitech Wireless for $1.36 billion.         
	There are various reasons why these deals have not been closed, including the minimum time required to close a deal to funding constraints faced by the acquirer.         
	While there was uncertainty about ONGCs $2.8-billion bid for Imperial Energy, latest reports suggested that the deal would be closed shortly.        
	In 2009, M amp;A experts expect inbound deals to increase as assets in India are cheaper and promoters more willing to sell.         
	The sale of Ranbaxy to Daiichi Sankyo is an appropriate example of the changing attitudes of Indian promoters, said Harish H.V.         
	The expectations of an increase in inbound transactions in 2009 have also increased since last year as there is a sudden increase in the number of high-value inbound deals.         
	In 2008, while $30 billion ($51.11 billion in 2007) of M amp;A transactions were announced in the country despite the global economic slowdown, 81 inbound deals totalling $12.48 billion were struck, according to data collated by Grant Thornton.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Sept. 15: Saudi Aramco and Kuwait Petroleum Corporation could be interested in the $10-billion refinery-cum-petrochemical project at Visakhapatnam, following the decision of Frances Total to leave the project.        
	Total has informed us that they would like to put their participation in the project on hold for the time being, sources in HPCL, which is heading the consortium, said.        
	The consortium is now looking for partners, and some feelers have come in, they said. The project is not going anywhere as of now. With Mittal and Total not participating, we have put the project on hold, they said.         
	In November, Lakshmi Mittal had put on hold his investment in the project after recession in Europe hit his firms fortunes.        
	A consortium of five firms  HPCL, GAIL, Oil India, Mittal Investment Sarl and Total  had signed a memorandum of understanding to look at the feasibility of the project.         
	The export-oriented refinery was proposed to have a capacity of 14 million tonnes a year, while the petrochemical plant was to have a one-million-tonne capacity.         
	Total was leading the project feasibility and demand studies, while GAIL was in charge of the study on the petrochemical unit. The equity structure and project finances were to be decided after the feasibility studies were completed later this year.        
	The sources said HPCL, GAIL and Oil India were to hold a 49 per cent stake in the Vizag project, while Mittal Investment Sarl and Total were to hold another 49 per cent.         
	The remaining 2 per cent were to be offered to financial institutions.        
	Saudi Aramco and Kuwait Petroleum Corporation (KPC) had earlier held discussions with the consortium but could not reach an agreement as their terms were not acceptable to the partners.        
	While Saudi Aramco had sought a minimum of 30 per cent in the refinery project, KPC was insisting on being the sole crude supplier and wanted the output to be sold locally. The conditions are not acceptable to HPCL. However, with Total and Mittal putting their participation on hold, sources said the offers of Saudi Aramco and KPC could be re-examined.         
	The only-for-exports refinery was being planned to target Southeast Asia and West Asia. About 2,500 acres near HPCLs existing 7.5mt refinery at Visakhapatnam has been acquired for the project.

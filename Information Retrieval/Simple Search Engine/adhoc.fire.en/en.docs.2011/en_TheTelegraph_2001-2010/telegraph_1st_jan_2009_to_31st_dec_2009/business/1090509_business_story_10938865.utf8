                                                                                                               DBS exits HDFC Bank, scrip takes a hit
                            
	Mumbai, May 8 (PTI): Singapore-based DBS Bank has offloaded its entire 2.7 per cent stake in HDFC Bank for Rs 1,291.12 crore in an open market transaction, pulling down the share price of the countrys second largest private lender by over 2 per cent on the Bombay Stock Exchange.        
	DBS Bank offloaded its holding of over 1.16 crore shares in the bank at Rs 1,111.04 per share in a bulk deal on the BSE.        
	DBS has offloaded its entire stake in HDFC Bank as it is an opportune time for divestment. This was a portfolio investment, which we had made few years back. We remain committed to India as a focus of our growth plans, a DBS Bank spokesperson said.        
	The HDFC Bank scrip fell 2.83 per cent to end at Rs 1,143.50, after touching an intra-day low of Rs 1,110.10, while over 1.36 crore shares changed hands on the BSE.        
	At the end of the March quarter, DBS Bank held shares representing a 2.73 per cent stake in HDFC Bank.        
	DBS Group Holdings today reported net earnings of 456 million Singapore dollars in the first quarter of 2009, and its revenues rose 6 per cent to 1.66 billion Singapore dollars.         
	DBS is one of best-capitalised banks in Asia and our capital ratios and underlying earnings remain strong. Given continuing uncertainties over how protracted the downturn will be, we remain vigilant in managing our balance sheet and ensuring that the franchise is in a solid position to capture growth opportunities, DBS Group Holdings chairman Koh Boon Hwee said.

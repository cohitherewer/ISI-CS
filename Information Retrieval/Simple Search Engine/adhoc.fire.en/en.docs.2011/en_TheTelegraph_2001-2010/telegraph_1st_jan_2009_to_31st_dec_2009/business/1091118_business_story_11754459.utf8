	Calcutta, Nov. 17: Fiat plans to launch CNG versions of its cars during the April-June quarter of 2010.        
	We are working on the CNG variant of a few models. The first one will be rolled out in the second quarter of next (calendar) year, Rajeev Kapoor, Fiat India Automobiles president and CEO, said here today. However, he declined to divulge any details on the models.        
	CNG is ultimately going to be a fuel for most commercial applications. The technology is available with Fiat, Kapoor said.        
	The company had plans to roll out the CNG variant of the Palio in early 2009. According to analysts, the Palio and the Grande Punto are the two probable cars that Fiat is initially considering for CNG.        
	CNG is seen as a viable option primarily because of assured domestic supplies.

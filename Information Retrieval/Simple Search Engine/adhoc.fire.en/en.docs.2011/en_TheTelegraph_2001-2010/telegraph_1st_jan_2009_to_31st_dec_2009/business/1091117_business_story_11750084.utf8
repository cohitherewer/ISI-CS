          JAYATI GHOSE                          Clear network                                  
	New Delhi, Nov. 16: Telecom operators today asked the department of telecom (DoT) to clarify the pricing and allocation of second-generation spectrum before initiating the sale of 3G spectrum.        
	At a pre-bid conference, called to discuss issues related to the 3G spectrum auction, operators said they would not be able to prepare investment plans for 3G unless the 2G policy became transparent.        
	At present, all mobile services are provided on 2G. A government appointed committee had earlier proposed selling all 2G spectrum beyond the initial 4.4 megahertz.        
	A policy decision on 2G pricing and allocation will be taken soon and a clarification issued, said DoT officials.        
	The telecom ministry is waiting for Trais recommendations before finalising the 2G spectrum allocation, pricing and merger rules. Trai, which has initiated a consultation process, is expected to send its proposals by the end of this month.        
	At the conference today, operators also questioned the rationale behind starting the bidding without clarifying the amount of 3G spectrum available in each circle.         
	DoT officials said a new list would be released on December 7 with details of the available slots as well as the exact sub-bands for the spectrum.        
	The government had said it would auction four slots of 3G spectrum to private operators in all the circles.         
	However, the government booklet on 3G says there are not enough spectrum in many circles to accommodate four operators. A committee headed by Sam Pitroda is also examining the possibility of auctioning four slots.        
	According to the auction guidelines, a bidder will have to pay a pan-India reserve price of Rs 3,500 crore for 3G spectrum and Rs 1,750 crore for WiMax.

                                                                                                               RIL seals pact with fertiliser firms
          OUR BUREAU                              
	March 27: Reliance Industries today signed deals with 12 fertiliser firms to sell about 15 million standard cubic metres a day (mmscmd) of gas from its block off the Andhra Pradesh coast.         
	Supplies will start from mid-April, Reliance said.         
	The firms will pay Reliance a marketing margin of 13.5 cents per million British thermal units (mmBtu) for the gas, said Satish Chander, director-general of the Fertiliser Association of India.         
	The margin is in addition to the government set price of $4.2 per mmBtu for the gas. However, at the Nymex, natural gas is ruling at $3.7 per mmBtu.         
	We are signing 15 contracts with 12 companies and the volumes are about 15 mmscmd, P.M.S. Prasad, the chief executive of Reliances oil and gas business, said.         
	Some of those signing deals with Reliance are Chambal Fertilisers, Iffco, Kribhco, GNFC, GSFC, Nagarjuna Fertilisers, Tata Chemicals and Rashtriya Chemicals and Fertilisers.         
	Reliance will raise gas output to 40 mmscmd later this year and 80 mmscmd by 2010, roughly equivalent to about 450,000 barrels per day of oil.         
	Initial volumes will meet the fuel deficit at 15 urea plants run by the 12 fertiliser companies.         
	The delivered price, including taxes and transportation charges, of RIL gas in Andhra Pradesh will be $5.34 per mmBtu, while in Maharashtra it will cost $5.87.         
	In Gujarat it will be $5.87 per mmBtu and along the Hazira-Vijaipur-Jagdishpur (HVJ) pipeline of GAIL (India) Limited, $6.21.        
	KG-D6 gas will land at Kakinada in Andhra Pradesh from where it will be transported to Baruch in Gujarat through a 1,386km pipeline laid by Reliance.         
	In Gujarat, Reliance will use the pipeline network of Gujarat State Petronet Ltd to take the gas to end-consumers as well as connect to the HVJ pipeline.        
	Eight urea plants on the HVJ pipeline, which transports fuel from the Gujarat coast to the north, will get 7.026 mmscmd of the gas.        
	Reliance will sell 6.689 mmscmd to Kribhco and GSFCs units in Gujarat, Rashtriya Chemicals Maharashtra plants and to Nagarjuna Fertiliser in Andhra Pradesh.

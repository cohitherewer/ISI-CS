	Calcutta, Aug. 10: Tea production in the country rose about 13 million kg in June, though exports fell 3.7 million kg in the same month.

	During the January-June period, production fell 3.4 per cent to 333.9 million kg against 345.7 million kg in the same period last year.        
	Globally, Uganda reported the highest rise of 38.7 per cent in production during January-June 2009 at 21.1 million kg, and Sri Lanka registered the biggest decline of 23.8 per cent at 130.5 million kg.

                                                                                                                 Q amp;A      Wealth list
                                I am in a fix thinking how to transact wealth tax and how or where it is to be paid. My daughter (17 years) got possession of a low-budget flat, but the registration of the property will not be done in the near term. Should the valuation of the flat (Rs 2.5 lakh) be mentioned in the asset list?          Benoy Ghose, Behala
                    If your net wealth is Rs 30 lakh, you will have to pay wealth tax at the rate of 1 per cent. Since the property is not yet registered in your daughters name, it will not be included in the wealth list. A person liable to pay wealth tax will have to file return of net wealth (total wealth minus outstanding debt) in Form A. The return filing date is similar to the date for filing income tax returns.                                  Cool calculation      On my retirement in December 2009, I am likely to get nearly Rs 20 lakh from provident fund, gratuity, leave salary. Shall I have to pay wealth tax? If so, please tell the procedure of payment of such tax?        B. Gangopahdhyay, Calcutta
                    While considering net wealth for wealth tax purposes, you shall have to take into account, in addition to Rs 20 lakh that you will get on retirement, all other assets in the name of you, your spouse, if she is not working, and in your minor childs name. If the amount exceeds Rs 30 lakh, only then you will have to pay wealth tax.                                  Not yet a senior      My date of birth is May 16, 1945. Can I file my income tax return as senior citizen for the financial year 2009-10 (assessment year 2010-11)? I had retired from a public sector undertaking and drawing a monthly income from LIC under the Super Annuation Benevolent Fund. LIC is releasing this monthly amount against purchase of annuity from them. Is this amount taxable?        Sudhir Das, Rahara 
                    You will be 65 years of age on May 16, 2010. Thus, you cannot claim the income tax benefits allowed to senior citizens. Annuity income is taxable and the applicable tax rate will correspond to your income bracket.                        If you have any queries about investing or taxes or a high-cost purchase you are planning, mail to: btgraphabpmail.com, or write to: Business Telegraph, 6 Prafulla Sarkar Street, Calcutta 700 001.

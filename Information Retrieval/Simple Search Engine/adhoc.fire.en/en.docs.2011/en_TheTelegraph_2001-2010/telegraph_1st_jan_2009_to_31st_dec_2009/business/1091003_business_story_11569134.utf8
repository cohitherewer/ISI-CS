                                                                                                               Panel to meet unions next week

	New Delhi, Oct. 2: A committee set up to look into the problems of Air India employees will begin meetings with the 14 unions next week.        
	The panel, which is a sub-committee of the Air India board, was set up on Tuesday.         
	Executive pilots of Air India called off their five-day strike earlier this week after the government stalled pay cuts the airline had ordered last week.        
	The pilots returned to work after assurances by aviation minister Praful Patel that pay cuts would be kept in abeyance and a committee set up to look into cost cuts.         
	Besides Air India chairman Arvind Jadhav, the committee includes E.K. Bharat Bhushan, joint secretary and financial adviser in the civil aviation ministry, and joint secretary Prashant Shukul.         
	The panel will submit its recommendations to the board within two months.         
	The committee plans to meet all the trade unions of NACIL (National Aviation Company of India Limited) to discuss the turnaround plan and seek their suggestions on the issue, union sources said.         
	Discussions will be held with the 14 trade unions separately, the representatives said. The unions will tell the government on how they can contribute.         
	We (unions) will give suggestions and define our contributions to the turnaround plan, they said.         
	The deliberations with the unions are likely to start from Sunday and may stretch till Thursday, they said.

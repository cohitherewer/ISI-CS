                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Jute meet to avert strike
          AMIT CHAKRABORTY                          Peace move                                  
	Calcutta, Nov. 26: The Bengal government has called a tripartite meeting on Friday to avert an indefinite strike in the jute industry from December 14. The meeting is among the representatives of the industry, unions and the state government.        
	Nineteen trade unions, including Citu, Intuc and the AITUC, today gave an ultimatum to the Indian Jute Mills Association and the state government to meet statutory dues, including the payment of arrears in dearness allowance, provident fund and insurance, to over 2.5 lakh workers in about 70 mills.        
	In a separate notice, the BJP-affiliated Bharatiya Mazdoor Sangh has threatened to go on an indefinite strike from November 30. Whatever agreement takes place to end a strike should happen before the strike begins, said S.S. Kanoria, chairman of Ludlow Jute and Specialities.         
	Citu leader Gobindo Guha said, The existence of trade unions is being challenged by disregarding the statutory dues of the workers.         
	Intuc leader Ganesh Sarkar said no new financial demands were being made. All we want is the governments intervention and the mill owners conscience to pay the statutory dues to the workers.

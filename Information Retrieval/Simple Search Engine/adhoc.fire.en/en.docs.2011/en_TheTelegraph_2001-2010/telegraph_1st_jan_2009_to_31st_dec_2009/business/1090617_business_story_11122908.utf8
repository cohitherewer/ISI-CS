The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Sistema to tap market
                                                                                                               Sistema to tap market
          SAMBIT SAHA AMP; SOUNAK MITRA                          Rozanov: Craving for more                                  
	Calcutta, June 16: Sistema Shyam Teleservices (SSTL), the joint venture between Indias Shyam Telelink and Sistema of Russia, is planning an initial public offer.        
	Vsevelod Rozanov, CEO of Sistema Shyam, said the firm would consider listing on the local bourses next year.         
	We will complete the pan-India rollout of our network by the third quarter of 2010. We will consider raising money from the market then, Rozanov told The Telegraph.        
	Sistema, Russias largest public diversified corporation with a subscriber base of 100 million, has a 73.71 per cent stake in the Indian entity, while Shyam Telelink owns much of the rest. Sistema Shyam offers its mobile services under the brand, MTS.        
	The company plans to invest $5.5 billion in rolling out its services, nationally, and upgrading its network. Rozanov said Sistema Shyam had secured the funds for this year. Both partners had committed the money.         
	However, the company may need more cash next year when an IPO will be considered.        
	Sistema Shyam expects to break even by 2012 when it hopes to have 35 million customers nationwide. It will launch services in Delhi in July-September and in Mumbai in October-December.        
	Though Sistema Shyam is using the CDMA (code division multiple access) platform  a technology that existing players such as Reliance Communications and Tata Teleservices are abandoning in favour of the GSM standard  Rozanov is happy with the subscriber base so far, which is 1.1 million in five circles.        
	We are very confident of the CDMA technology. Sistema Shyam has made the right choice, Rozanov said. The company has no plans of entering the GSM space, he said.        
	The thinking is that within four to five years mobile standards will be unified and the difference between CDMA and GSM will lose its relevance.        
	Rozanov said more than half of the new MTS customers were from a competing service provider.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Kulpi port plan on course
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Kulpi port plan on course
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Calcutta, Nov. 27: Dubai Worlds debt default is unlikely to impact the development of a proposed container port at Kulpi in South 24-Parganas, Bengal.        
	DP World, which runs 49 ports across the globe, is an equal partner in the Rs 2,000-crore project with city-based industrialist Mahendra K. Jalan.         
	Sources close to DP World, which is majority owned by the troubled Dubai World, said the shipping and port company was still committed to the project. DP Worlds finances are strong. There is no need to worry, they said.        
	Bengal Port, of which the Dubai company is a co-promoter with Jalans Keventer, is awaiting a tripartite contract with the Calcutta Port Trust (CPT) and Bengal government to kick off the project, which has been on the drawing board for many years.        
	Jalan said the port would come up. We are going to build it no matter what happens, he said.        
	Bengal Port wants to build a container terminal at Kulpi on the river Hooghly opposite to Haldia. An industrial zone around the port is also on agenda. However, Bengal Port and the Calcutta Port Trust, which has jurisdiction over the river Hooghly, are yet to agree on the sharing of dredging costs.        
	The private developer said it was willing to pay the CPT the amount required to maintain the river channel up to its port. However, the CPT wanted it to bear a higher share. The CPT spends Rs 350-400 crore a year on dredging to maintain the shipping channel in Hooghly.

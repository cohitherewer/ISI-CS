        Srikumar Bondyopadhyay offers suggestions on how to build your mutual fund investment portfolio                                            
	The countrys first mutual fund was created in 1963 by the promulgation of the Unit Trust of India Act to channelise retail investments into equity markets to create a vibrant capital market for corporations and involve the small investor in the process of wealth creation.         
	After almost five decades, the share of equity is below 25 per cent of the total assets managed by mutual funds in the country (as at the end of October 2009).        
	According to estimates by the Reserve Bank, only 2.6 per cent, or Rs 19,349 crore, of total financial savings by the household sector were in shares and debentures, including mutual funds, in 2008-09. Equities are losing the battle to other investment options such as bank deposits, life insurance and small savings schemes in attracting household investments.         
	Theme for a dream        
	With a focus on increasing their assets under management, mutual funds have been launching new funds designed to match the flavour of the season so that it appealed to investors the most.         
	However, when a particular sector goes out of favour at the bourses or does poorly because of some other economic reasons, the thematic fund based on that sector performs badly and investors in the fund bear the brunt.        
	Investors should not flock blindly to any new fund that is on offer. The lure of getting units at face value of Rs 10 often blinds them from seeing the investment risk in an NFO that has no track record.         
	However, these thematic products are not all wrong. As a mutual fund investor one should examine the new product or service that a fund house tries to sell as an innovation.         
	Innovations are not new to domestic mutual funds. However, the idea gained popularity since 1993 when private sector players were allowed to set up asset management companies. Newer products such as index funds, fund of funds came in alongside sector-specific funds.         
	Fresh flavour        
	In recent times, mutual fund products with different underlying assets had been launched  exchange traded funds with gold or silver as the underlying asset, funds investing in international funds with the underlying asset being equities of companies listed overseas and funds compliant with religious faith (Shariah fund).         
	These funds offer investors an opportunity to diversify their mutual fund portfolio into newer asset classes but they also pack in certain risks such as foreign currency and geo-political risks of the countries where the investments are made.        
	Unless you properly understand those risks and are well conversant with global economic developments, investing in these funds can prove disastrous because the returns may be highly volatile.        
	Some innovations have been introduced in mutual fund services as well. You can now get funds that allow dynamic asset allocation among equity, debt and other asset classes such as gold.         
	Some fund houses have also launched schemes that automatically book profits once the return on investment crosses a pre-determined threshold.         
	These are extremely beneficial for small investors who often cannot track the markets and fail to book profits at an appropriate time.         
	Core portfolio        
	While creating a mutual fund portfolio, one should always bear in mind the investment objective  a stable and good return over a period of time.         
	Given this, the core of ones mutual fund portfolio should comprise two or three diversified equity schemes that have yielded a good return over, say, 10 years.         
	The core portfolio should comprise 50 to 70 per cent of ones total mutual fund investment. The percentage may vary from individual to individual depending on ones ability to accept volatility in returns.         
	If you are young and/or ready to accept a higher degree of volatility, your allocation to core portfolio should be at the lower end of the band. Risk-averse investors can include a balanced fund or a target return fund (that ensures profit booking at specified levels) alongside diversified equity funds to construct their core portfolio.        
	Top it up        
	Once you have decided upon the core, top it up with one or two index funds by allocating 15 to 20 per cent of your total investment. An index fund is a passively managed fund that tracks the returns of the underlying benchmark equity index.        
	The inclusion of an index fund is important because at times a diversified equity fund may give lower returns than the equity index. If you have an index fund in your portfolio, to that extent you can protect return on your overall investment. Besides, being a passively managed fund, the cost of index funds is also low.        
	The remaining 15 to 30 per cent of your investment can be distributed between three or four speciality funds such as domestic sector-specific funds, international sector-specific fund-of-funds (FoFs) and gold funds/ETFs.        
	Investment in sector-specific international FoFs is more prudent than in a country-specific or a plain vanilla international FoF. This is so because a country-specific or a region-specific fund will lead to concentration of foreign currency and geo-political risks to that particular country or region only.         
	Instead, if you choose a sector-specific fund, for example, a global energy fund or world mining fund, it will involve leading multinational companies, irrespective of their countries of origin, engaged in that particular sector. This will lower the portfolio risk. And if that sector happens to be a growth sector, you stand to gain more than investing in a country or region-specific fund.

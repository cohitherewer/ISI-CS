                                                                                                               Bid to hasten Kulpi port
          OUR BUREAU                          Chakrabarti: Rush hour                                  
	Calcutta, March 4: Bengal has asked the Centre to sort out the disputes over the proposed container port at Kulpi within two weeks.        
	State chief secretary Asok Mohan Chakrabarti has requested Union shipping secretary A.P.V.N. Sarma to talk to Calcutta Port Trust to ensure that the proposed port gets a clearance from the CPT within a fortnight.        
	I urged him to persuade the CPT to give Kulpi port the necessary clearance. I also told him that two additional dredgers would be required in Haldia right now as the water draught was falling, he said.        
	Chakrabarti has also talked about the need to set up an independent authority to supervise the waterways, which was under the CPT. This is an issue that needs dialogue. However, it would be good to have an independent authority to look after the waterways. Otherwise, everything will depend on the CPT, he said.        
	The CPT has been demanding that Kulpi port, in which DP World of Dubai is a partner, should share the dredging cost for maintaining the Haldia channel though ships going to Kulpi would not use that path. The state government has suggested that ships coming to ports  Haldia, Calcutta or Kulpi  should pay for the dredging cost.        
	The independent authority should charge ships using the waterways to maintain them  be it dredging or any other way, Mahendra K Jalan, director of Bengal Port, the promoter of Kulpi container port, said.        
	The CPT had suggested to the state that the width of the proposed Raichak-Kukrahati bridge be at least 5.5 metres. I dont know the reason behind this. I will discuss with the department concerned, Chakrabarti said.

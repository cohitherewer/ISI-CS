The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Tea trumps troubled ties
                                                                                                               Tea trumps troubled ties
          SOUNAK MITRA                               
	Calcutta, Jan. 3: Mounting tension with Pakistan after the Mumbai terror attacks has not affected Indias tea exports to Pakistan.        
	Tea Board chairman Basudeb Banerjee said Pakistan had not cancelled any order after the terror strike. Tea exports to Pakistan will not be hurt because of the current political situation, he added.             STRONG BREW Tea exports      Year (Jan-Dec)  To Pakistan  Total      2008 *  10.00  200.00      2008 
  (Jan- Aug)  5.00        2007  5.48  178.75      2006  14.73  218.73      2005  11.00  199.05      2004  3.49  197.67      Figures in million kg      * Full-year projection; Source: ITA      
	The Pakistan Tea Association, however, declined to comment on the issue.        
	According to Indian Tea Association (ITA) data, India aims to increase its export to Pakistan to 10 million kg in 2008 from 5.48 million kg in 2007. Pakistan is the worlds third-largest importer of tea.        
	India, meanwhile, has called off its Pakistan tour this month to promote local tea. The delegation had planned to meet traders in Pakistan and encourage them to import more from India.         
	According to Banerjee, overall tea exports in 2008 are likely to hover around 200 million kg, a marginal increase over 178.75 million kg last year as the global slowdown may upset targets. We are trying to export 195-200 million kg this year. Exports started falling from the September-October period because of non-payments. But there is no impact on demand, he said.         
	Delegation to Iran        
	A delegation, led by P.K. Chaudhury, additional secretary in the ministry of commerce, has reached Iran to promote Indian tea and resolve regulatory issues with the country. Tea Board chairman Basudeb Banerjee and ITAs Monojit Dasgupta is part of the team.         
	If the regulatory matters get resolved, Indias share in the Iranian tea market will rise substantially. India sold 11 million kg of tea to Iran last fiscal against its annual import of 70-80 million kg, an ITA spokesperson said.                           
	Earlier this month, Ramesh said India aims to export about 25-30 million KG in the next few years to Iran.                                      
	In November last year, it was decided that the ministry of finance of both the countries would take up the banking, finance and insurance issues with their respective Central banks for an early resolution.        
	Pakistan  which annually needs 160 million KG for domestic consumption  imports almost 80% of its tea requirement from African countries like Kenya.        
	Easing of tea shipments from India to Pakistan had been a crucial issue to increase exports to Pakistan. While the transit time from Mombassa to Pakistan is two weeks, it takes between four to six weeks from India to Pakistan.         
	The Karachi tea market in Pakistan is fed through the sea route, while the Islamabad-Lahore market is fed through the land route. India was planning to export tea from Amritsar, 25 km from Lahore, through the Atari-Wagah border.         
	Meanwhile, expecting rise in export demand, companies like Tata Tea and Hindustan Unilever have reportedly ramped up their procurement by 75-80% in 2008 from the Guwahati auction centre, against a previous procurement of 50%, of the total tea auctioned.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | D-Day arrives for Satyam suitors
                                                                                                               D-Day arrives for Satyam suitors
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                            
	Mumbai, April 12: A strategic investor for Satyam is likely to emerge tomorrow when the government-appointed board meets to evaluate the bids.         
	Analysts are debating the price tag of the winning bid on the beleaguered software firm.         
	Many believe that the suitors are likely to be conservative in their pricing because of a lack of clarity over Satyams finances and liabilities. The Satyam stock ended at Rs 47.15 on the Bombay Stock Exchange on Thursday.         
	Market circles say the initial bids are unlikely to be above the existing share price.         
	The bidders will, in all probability, quote a price which is lower than or close to the current market price. Even if another round of bidding is held, the parties are unlikely to be aggressive, said an analyst from a domestic brokerage.        
	The board had extended the deadline for submitting the financial bids till tomorrow.         
	The highest bid, for a 31 per cent stake, will be the winning one if there are no other offers that are at least 90 per cent of the top bid.        
	Otherwise, the top bidder plus those whose offers meet the 90-per-cent criterion will go for an open auction. The floor price for the auction will be the highest bid in the first round.        
	The analyst said that should there be another round of auction, the bidders were unlikely to quote a price higher than Rs 55-60 per share.        
	Though a minimum floor price has not been fixed, it is believed that the Satyam board will not accept bids which are too low.        
	The board had earlier said that they were in no position to provide an estimate of the companys liabilities.        
	Apart from a dozen odd class action suits filed against Satyam in the US, the Hyderabad-based company is also engaged in a legal battle with mobile solutions provider Upaid.         
	In 2007, the UK-based company had filed a case against Satyam accusing it of forgery and demanding $1 billion in damages.        
	Adding to the list of liabilities is Satyam founder B. Ramalinga Rajus claim of pumping Rs 1,200 crore into the company by pledging the shares of his family.        
	All these uncertainties will make the bidders extremely cautious. After all, they are also answerable to their shareholders, says another analyst.        
	Larsen amp; Toubro, which is the single largest shareholder in Satyam with a 12 per cent stake, is one of the frontrunners along with Tech Mahindra.         
	The boards of both the companies met today but did not give any detail.        
	Nasdaq-listed Cognizant Technology Solutions, which is learnt to have teamed up with Wilbur Ross, is also in the race.        
	The Hinduja group and US-based iGATE have opted out of the bidding citing a lack of transparency in the auction process.        
	The successful bidder will be given four days to deposit the amount for the 31 per cent stake.         
	The funds for the remaining 20 per cent will have to be parked in an escrow account.

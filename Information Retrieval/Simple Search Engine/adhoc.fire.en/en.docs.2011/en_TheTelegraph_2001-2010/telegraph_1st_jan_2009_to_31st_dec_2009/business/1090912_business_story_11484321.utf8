The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Morgan set to get a new CEO 
                                                                                                               Morgan set to get a new CEO 
                            
	New York, Sept. 11 (Reuters): Morgan Stanley chief executive John Mack is stepping down and will be replaced by retail brokerage head James Gorman, signalling the storied bank is embracing stable businesses after losing big on risky ones.        
	Mack, 64, a former trader who rose to CEO after a coup toppled Philip Purcell, will remain chairman of Morgan Stanley, which suffered a second-quarter loss of $1.26 billion.        
	Under Mack, Morgan Stanley was willing to bet more of the banks own money, a strategy that yielded big rewards in 2006, but also helped push the investment bank to the brink of collapse in 2008.        
	The choice of Gorman, 51, who runs Morgan Stanleys brokerage and has been overseeing its expansion through a joint venture with Citigroups Smith Barney unit, could be a sign of a wider shift in the industry, analysts said.        
	Gorman will take over the CEOs job and join the board of the bank effective January 1, next year.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Common govt stand on twin gas disputes 
                                                                                                               Common govt stand on twin gas disputes 
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Moily: Balancing act                                  
	New Delhi, Aug. 20: The government will take an identical stand on the two gas rows involving Mukesh Ambanis Reliance Industries  one with state-owned NTPC and the other with brother Anils Reliance Natural Resources Limited (RNRL).        
	A ministerial panel tonight decided on this course of action amid concerns that the spat between the Ambani brothers, now before the Supreme Court, would affect the RIL-NTPC case in Bombay High Court. The government would issue a statement on the NTPC case tomorrow.        
	Headed by Pranab Mukherjee, the panel was set up to finalise the governments position on the two disputes over gas from the Krishna-Godavari (KG) basin.        
	Both RNRL and NTPC want gas for $2.34 per million British thermal unit from Reliance Industries. In RNRL, the government has decreed that the price should be $4.2.        
	We will try to see that the government is one on the NTPC-RIL and RIL-RNRL issues, law minister Veerappa Moily said after todays meeting of the panel.        
	Earlier in the day, power minister Sushilkumar Shinde had said his ministry had no differences with the oil ministry.        
	I dont think there is any difference between the petroleum ministry and power ministry on the RIL gas dispute, he said.

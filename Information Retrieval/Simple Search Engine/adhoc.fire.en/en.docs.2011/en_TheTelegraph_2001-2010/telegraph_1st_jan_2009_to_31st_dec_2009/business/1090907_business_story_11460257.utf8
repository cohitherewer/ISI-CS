	London, Sept.6 (Reuters): British bank HSBC has made a bid of about 1 billion ($1.63 billion) for Dutch financial group INGs private banking businesses, according to a report in The Sunday Times.        
	The report said DBS  a Singaporean investment fund  and Julius Baer, the Swiss wealth manager, were also likely to bid for the unit and that a preferred bidder would be named in the next 10 days.        
	ING, which has put its private banking operations in Switzerland and Asia up for sale to pay down bailout funds it received from the Dutch government, is also considering plans to split its insurance arm from its banking business.        
	The Sunday Times said DBS was interested only in the Asian unit but that Julius Baer was keen on both assets.

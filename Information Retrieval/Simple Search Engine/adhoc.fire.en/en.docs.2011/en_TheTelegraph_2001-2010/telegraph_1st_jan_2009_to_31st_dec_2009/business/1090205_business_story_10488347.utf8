                                                                                                               BoI chief first choice for RBI post
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      Narayanasami: Top of the list                          
	New Delhi, Feb. 4: Bank of India chairman T.S. Narayanasami is the favourite to be a deputy governor of the Reserve Bank of India.         
	A search panel was formed by the government to shortlist candidates for the post left vacant by V. Leeladhar, who retired in December.        
	Officials said Narayanasami was most likely to be selected by the appointments committee of the cabinet, which would meet once the Prime Minister rejoined office. Prime Minister Manmohan Singh is currently recovering from a heart surgery.        
	IDBI Bank chairman Yogesh Agarwal and Canara Bank chief A.C. Mahajan were also interviewed. But Narayanasami, who is also the chairman of the Indian Banks Association, has emerged as the favourite.        
	He first became the chairman and managing director of Andhra Bank in April 2004. Then, he moved to Indian Overseas Bank and finally to the Bank of India in June 2007.        
	K.C. Chakraborty, chairman of Punjab National Bank, was also considered for the post but opted out of the race as he still had many more years to continue as the head of the Delhi-based bank.         
	The post of the deputy governor is expected to be filled this month, sources said.        
	The RBI has four deputy governors and Leeladhar was in charge of banking operations and supervision.        
	The search committee was headed by RBI governor D. Subbarao and had members from the central government, including finance secretary Arun Ramanathan and former SBI managing director Vepa Kamesan.        
	This is the first time that such a post is being filled through a search committee, officials said.

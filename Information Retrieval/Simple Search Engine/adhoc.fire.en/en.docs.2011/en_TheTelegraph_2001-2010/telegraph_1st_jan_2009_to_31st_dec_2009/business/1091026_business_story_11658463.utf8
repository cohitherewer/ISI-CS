The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Court revives Sterlite bid for Asarco
                                                                                                               Court revives Sterlite bid for Asarco
          SAMBIT SAHA                                             
	Calcutta, Oct. 25: NRI billionaire Anil Agarwals Sterlite Industries will get another chance to stake a claim to US copper miner Asarco LLC.         
	Andrew S. Hanen, a district court judge of Texas, has declined from confirming the verdict of a lower bankruptcy court that had recommended Grupo Mexico for Asarco.        
	Instead, Justice Hanen said the court would allow Sterlite to present its $2.5-billion reorganisation plan for Asarco.         
	Last month, Sterlite had raised its offer price for the copper miner to $2.56 billion from $2.13 billion in a last-ditch attempt to thwart Grupo Mexico.         
	However, US bankruptcy court judge Richard Schimdt overruled Sterlites revised bid.         
	He said the Mexican companys reorganisation plan was more likely to pay back Asarcos creditors.         
	All eyes are now on district judge Hanen who is expected to give the final verdict by the end of November.         
	Sterlites hopes have revived as the judge is seen taking a more holistic approach rather than focusing only on the creditors.         
	American trade union United Steel Workers, which has always supported Sterlite, will also present its position before the court.         
	Arizona, the US state where Asarco has its operations, is also against Grupo Mexico as the state government fears the Mexican company will saddle Asarco with too much debt. Arizona has backed the Sterlite plan and also the interim management of Asarco.        
	Prized catch        
	The company that wins Asarco will take over an entity that has been making steady profits. In its monthly report for August, filed on September 30, Asarco has reported a profit of about $40 million on a revenue of about $100 million, a big jump from Julys $24-million profit on a revenue of $76 million.         
	Since its filing for bankruptcy protection in August 2005, Asarco has earned a profit of about $1.54 billion and a revenue of $5.47 billion.         
	Asarco is the third-largest copper producer in the US, with stakes in five mines.         
	The final decision will be taken by the district judge and not the bankruptcy judge as the latter has no authority on financial matters vis--vis the claims of entities for asbestos-related damages from Asarco.        
	Sterlite originally offered $2.6 billion but later reduced it to $1.7 billion after global recession sent copper prices tumbling.         
	Grupo Mexico matched that offer and then kept pace with Sterlite, which revised its bid several times.         
	Last year, judge Hanen held Grupo Mexico guilty of defrauding Asarcos creditors. Grupo Mexico was found transferring the ownership of Asarcos rich copper assets in Peru to one of its units. The Mexican company has appealed against the verdict.         
	Sterlite has said that it will relieve Grupo from paying a penalty in the defrauding case if it gets control of Asarco.         
	Fight for control        
	The battle for Asarco goes back to the nineties when international mining interests scrambled for a presence in the rich copper belt in the Americas, which extended from Mexicos Sierra Madre to the US.         
	In 1999, Grupo Mexico outbid several larger entities in a surprise $1-billion takeover of Asarco. It was then one of the biggest acquisitions in the US by a Mexican corporation.         
	Grupo Mexico has since been accused of forcing Asarco into bankruptcy, making it difficult for parties alleging environmental damage to get funds for cleaning up dozens of contaminated sites.

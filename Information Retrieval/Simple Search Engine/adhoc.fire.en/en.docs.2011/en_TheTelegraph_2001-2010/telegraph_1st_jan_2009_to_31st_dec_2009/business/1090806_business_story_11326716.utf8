	Calcutta, Aug. 5: Infosys Technologies, the second biggest software exporter of the country, is looking for acquisitions in Japan, Australia, Latin America and Europe.        
	We are looking at companies which earn around 10 per cent of our revenues. We will prefer companies serving the energy and healthcare sector with revenues of $450-$500 million, S. Gopalakrishnan, chief executive officer and managing director of Infosys, said on the sidelines of a programme organised by the CII (eastern region) here.         
	Gopalakrishnan said Infosys was pursuing 12 to 15 deals worth $1 billion in this financial year. These deals are in the pipeline and worth $15 million each, he said.        
	The CEO said pricing would remain under pressure for sometime. Recovery in volume is expected, not in pricing. We should be cautious, Gopalakrishnan said.        
	All major software exporters such as Infosys, Tata Consultancy Services and Wipro have been reaching out to new markets to reduce their dependence on the US, which brings in more than half their revenue.        
	Europe contributes 26 per cent to Infosyss revenue and the company expects this to go up to 30 per cent. But Gopalakrishnan declined to give a time frame for this growth.         
	The rest of the world accounts for 10 per cent of the companys revenue and this is expected to rise to 20-30 per cent.         
	Infosys is uncertain about its earnings outlook in the near-term. The company has forecast that its first annual revenue will fall for the year to March 2010 because of demands for fee cuts by its overseas clients.

	The Infosys CEO said there was no immediate plan to appoint a co-chairman, a post vacated by Nandan Nilekani.        
	Wipro plan        
	Suresh Senapaty, Wipros executive director and chief financial officer, said the company was eyeing buyouts in Japan, Australia, Latin America and Europe.        
	We are looking at companies with revenues of around $30 million, but theres no upper cap, Senapaty said. Wipro is also pursuing some outsourcing deals, mostly from the Indian government, he said.

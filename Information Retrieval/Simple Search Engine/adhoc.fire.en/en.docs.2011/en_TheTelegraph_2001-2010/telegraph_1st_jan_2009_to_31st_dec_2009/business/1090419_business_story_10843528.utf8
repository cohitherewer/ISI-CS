The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Delta closes call centres in India
                                                                                                               Delta closes call centres in India
                            
	Washington, April 18 (PTI): Americas Delta Airlines, the worlds largest airline, has decided to close its call centres in India.        
	Airlines officials said the decision was driven by poor customer feedback.         
	This could come as a major setback to the countrys flourishing call centres which provide employment to thousands of youths across the country. Deltas calls in India were handled by a centre of Wipro Ltd.        
	Media reports said Richard Anderson, the airlines chief executive, told employees in a recorded message on Thursday night that Delta had stopped forwarding calls to India in the first quarter and would be bringing the function back in-house in the US.        
	The customer acceptance of call centres in foreign countries is low and our customers were not shy about letting us have that feedback, Anderson said.

	Kuala Lumpur, June 8 (PTI): Airlines financial loss worldwide has been forecast at a whopping $9 billion for 2009 by the International Air Transport Association (IATA) today, nearly double the associations March estimate of a $4.7billion loss.        
	The IATA also revised its loss estimate for 2008 to $10.4 billion from the previous estimate of $8.5 billion.        
	There is no modern precedent for todays economic meltdown. The ground has shifted. Our industry has been shaken. This is the most difficult situation that the industry has faced, IATA director-general and CEO Giovanni Bisignani told the top leaders of the global airline industry at the associations 65th annual general meeting here.        
	After September 11, revenues fell 7 per cent. It took three years to recover lost ground, even on the back of a strong economy. This time we face a 15 per cent drop  a loss of revenues of $80 billion  in the middle of a global recession, Bisignani said.        
	He emphasised that the industry was not looking for a bailout, apparently referring to the huge bailouts provided by some nations to save their top banks from collapsing.        
	Our future depends on a drastic reshaping by partners, governments and industry. We cannot bear the cost of government micro-regulation, crazy taxation and partners abusing their monopoly power, Bisignani said.         
	The recession has hit the industry hard, robbing it of its premium class passengers who provide a major chunk of its profits, he said.        
	IATAs revised forecast sees revenues declining an unprecedented 15 per cent from $528 billion in 2008 to $448 billion in 2009. Air cargo demand, an indicator of the health of an economy, is expected to decline 17 per cent.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Kumar Mangalam Birla in Mumbai on Tuesday. (Fotocorp)                                  
	Mumbai, Oct. 6: Aditya Birla group chairman Kumar Mangalam Birla today said the merger of UltraTech Cement and Samruddhi Cement would take around 7-8 months to complete.        
	The UltraTech board has given an in-principle approval to the merger. We have appointed Bansi Mehta amp; Co as a valuer. We hope the whole process to take anywhere between seven and eight months, or nine months at the maximum, to complete, he said.        
	The companys board will meet again in the first week of November by when the valuers are likely to submit their report. Last Saturday, the AV Birla group had decided to hive off the cement business of Grasim Industries to Samruddhi Cement, a wholly owned subsidiary.         
	Yesterday, Samruddhi had approached UltraTech for a merger.        
	Justifying the deal and the method adopted, Birla said the investors of both Grasim and UltraTech had been asking for a single legal entity to house the cement business. The merger will create a large entity with a greater financial flexibility. Another objective behind the demerger was to have a strong parentage for Grasim in the cement business.        
	Grasim now holds 100 per cent in Samruddhi. On completion of the demerger, Grasim shareholders will directly hold 35 per cent of Samruddhi and the firms stake will come down to 65 per cent. It is expected that if Samruddhi and UltraTech are merged, Grasims holding will be between 55 and 65 per cent.        
	Birla said that having the cement business under a single company would provide financial flexibility to grow.         
	He quelled analysts concerns that Grasim would morph into a holding company and said cement would remain its operating asset.        
	Grasims cash flow will be used to not only fund its viscose staple fibre business but also spur the growth of the cement business under UltraTech.

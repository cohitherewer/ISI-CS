          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                                
	New Delhi, Feb. 13: Railway minister Lalu Prasads plan of achieving a Rs 100,000-crore cash surplus during his tenure has come unstuck because of the economic slowdown, a spike in diesel prices and a hike in salaries following the recommendations of the Sixth Pay Commission.        
	The surplus before dividend in 2008-09 is Rs 19,320 crore against Rs 25,000 crore in the previous year.         
	For the next fiscal, the surplus is forecast to be still lower at Rs 18,847 crore.        
	Operating ratio, which is the ratio of expenditure to income, is seen to go up by 100 basis points in percentage terms.        
	In the past five years, during Lalus tenure, the railways have earned a surplus of Rs 90,000 crore.         
	The impact of the pay commission has been much higher than was expected, Railway Board chairman S. S. Khurana said.        
	He said the impact of the pay commissions recommendations in 2008-09 was about Rs 13,500 crore, and in the next fiscal it was estimated at Rs 14,500 crore. Higher salaries are expected to push up the operating ratio to 89.9 per cent from 88.3 per cent.        
	In addition, total working capital expenses are estimated at Rs 83,600 crore in 2009-10 against Rs 72,500 crore in 2008-09. Notwithstanding the crude plunge, fuel expenses are seen to be higher by Rs 600.49 crore at Rs 14,218.23 crore in this fiscal. For the next fiscal, the fuel bill is seen at Rs 14,855.66 crore.        
	Earnings from freight for the next fiscal have been fixed at Rs 59,090 crore, with volumes going up by 60 million tonnes (mt) to 910 mt.        
	This is not an ambitious target. We have estiamted this as the economy is growing at the rate of 7 per cent, Khurana said.        
	The railways plan to earn Rs 54,293 crore freight revenue in the current fiscal against the budget estimate of Rs 52,700 crore.        
	Lalu said earnings took a hit in October-November because of the global recession. There was a steep reduction in iron ore for export and container traffic. The growth of steel traffic also decreased, he said.        
	The situation in December and January indicates some improvement and we are not only hopeful but also confident that the budget target for passenger and goods earning set for this fiscal will be surpassed, the minister said.        
	Revenues from passengers are forecast to go up to Rs 25,000 crore in 2009-10 from the revised budget estimate of Rs 22,330 crore for this fiscal. Passenger traffic is expected to grow by around 7 per cent.         
	The cut in passenger fare will result in a revenue loss of Rs 700 crore in the next fiscal, Khurana said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Banks to slash rates by July
                                                                                                               Banks to slash rates by July
          JAYATI GHOSE                          Trim act                                  
	New Delhi, June 16: Banks are keen to cut interest rates by 100-150 basis points over the next few weeks to boost credit growth.        
	Interest rates are doing a downward spiral. We will take a call on the quantum of rate cut by the end of June when the asset liability committee meets, Alok K. Misra, chairman and managing director of the Oriental Bank of Commerce, told The Telegraph.         
	While most PSU banks lend at 11.75-12.25 per cent  Delhi-based Punjab National Bank has the lowest prime lending rate of 11 per cent  private banks such as ICICI Bank, HDFC Bank and Axis Bank give loans at 12.75-16 per cent.        
	Yes Bank said it would cut its benchmark lending rate by 50 basis points from July. Overall, banks may reduce rates by 1-1.5 per cent over the next few weeks, said Rana Kapoor, managing director of Yes Bank.        
	The State Bank of India had said last week that there was scope for a 25-basis-point cut.         
	Finance minister Pranab Mukherjee had already asked public sector banks to cut lending rates further. Though the Reserve Bank of India had trimmed its benchmark rates, Mukherjee said these measures were not getting adequately reflected in loans.        
	However, most bankers, including RBI deputy governor K.C. Chakrabarty, feel there will be no drastic reduction in interest rates in the long term, while in the short term they will remain benign.        
	Senior bankers said the softening of interest rates could revive the slack demand in credit growth.        
	Canara Bank, which is likely to announce a cut in its prime lending rate by June end, has revised its loan growth target to around 21-22 per cent during the current fiscal compared with 29 per cent in the last fiscal. While there is sufficient liquidity in the system, the credit offtake has not been very high, said Canara Bank chairman A.C. Mahajan.

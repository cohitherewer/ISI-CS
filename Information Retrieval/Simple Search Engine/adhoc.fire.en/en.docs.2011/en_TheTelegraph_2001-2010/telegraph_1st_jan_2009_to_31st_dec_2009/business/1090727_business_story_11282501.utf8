The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | A perfect blend
                                                                                                               A perfect blend
        Invest in the New Pension Scheme as part of your retirement planning and go for a judicious mix of EPF and PPF to take care of other financial liabilities, says Srikumar Bondyopadhyay                                          
	Thanks to the budget proposals for 2009-10, an individual income taxpayer can now claim deduction up to Rs 1 lakh in a financial year for investment in the New Pension Scheme (NPS). Even the accumulation in ones NPS account will not attract any income tax.        
	Withdrawals from an NPS account, however, will be subject to tax.        
	Many choices        
	NPS has been introduced for all citizens of the country from May this year. Individuals now have five retirement options  Employees Provident Fund (EPF), Public Provident Fund (PPF), deferred annuity plans of life insurance companies, mutual funds and the New Pension Scheme. Of these, EPF is only for the salaried.        
	Of the five options, EPF and PPF cost the least because subscribers to these funds dont have to bear any additional charge. At the same time, returns from these funds are assured but low compared to the other instruments.         
	However, a big advantage of these two schemes is that contributions, accumulations as well as withdrawals are tax-exempt.         
	The right mix        
	According to the Finance Bill 2009-10, if the maturity proceeds from an NPS account are used entirely to buy annuities from a life insurance company, the withdrawal will not be considered as income in the hands of the subscriber to the NPS and hence will not be taxed. The annuity income, like any pension income, is taxable.        
	Since part of the NPS fund will also be invested in equities, though passively, the scheme is likely to generate higher return than EPF or PPF. For a better retirement planning, it would be judicious to consider a blend of all the three  NPS, EPF and PPF  so that one can take advantage of tax exemption on withdrawals in the case of EPF and PPF, while getting higher returns in NPS.         
	Let us assume that 30-year-old Nirmal Dey earns a basic salary of Rs 15,000 per month. His own contribution to EPF will be Rs 1,800. While his employer will extend a matching contribution, only Rs 1,259 will go towards EPF and the remaining Rs 541 will go to the Employees Pension Scheme.         
	Deys EPF account will get a monthly contribution of Rs 3,059. At an annually compounded interest rate of 8.5 per cent, Deys accumulated fund in the EPF account at the end of 30 years will be Rs 45,59,674.         
	The withdrawal of this amount at the time of retirement will attract no tax.         
	Dey also invests Rs 2,000 a month in a PPF account, which at an annually compounded interest rate of 8 per cent, will amount to Rs 29,36,301 when he becomes 60-years-old.        
	Dey now decides to invest Rs 2,000 a month in the New Pension Scheme. To invest in NPS, Dey will have to fork out a recurring cost of Rs 470 per annum in addition to 0.009 per cent fund management fees plus an annual asset servicing charge between 0.075 per cent and 0.050 per cent, depending on electronic or the physical mode of holding.        
	After deducting the costs associated with NPS investment, Deys fund value will stand at Rs 51,81,221, of which he can withdraw a maximum 20 per cent as lump sum and with the rest he will have to buy annuities from a life insurance company.         
	However, he will have to pay income tax (here we have considered the maximum rate of 30 per cent plus 3 per cent education cess).        
	As can be seen from the table, Deys total retirement kitty will be Rs 1,26,77,196, of which he can withdraw Rs 85,32,219 and pay an income tax of Rs 3,20,119.         
	Deys total fund value post-tax is Rs 1,23,57,077 and out of this, he will have to use compulsorily Rs 41,44,977 to purchase annuities from a life insurance company.         
	With a 6 per cent rate of return, an immediate annuity plan for Rs 41,44,977 will fetch Dey a pension income of nearly Rs 28,500 per month till he survives. Besides, Dey will also receive a small pension of few thousand rupees from the Employees Pension Scheme.         
	Secure future        
	The arrangement ensures a monthly pension income of Rs 30,000 and Dey is free to deploy the remaining Rs 82,12,100 (after tax) to earn more income.         
	It is thus clear that the absence of adequate tax incentives for NPS doesnt make it unattractive. People should rather consider investment in NPS along with other available retirement plans.         
	The return from NPS is likely to increase after the trust has been exempted from paying income tax and securities transaction tax. The only drawback of NPS is that it is rather expensive for small investors. A fixed cost of Rs 470 per annum for an annual investment of Rs 24,000 works out to 1.958 per cent. Add to this the fund management and asset servicing fees and it will go up to 2 per cent.         
	In many equity mutual funds, the expense ratio is much less than 2 per cent and if you buy the units directly from a fund house, you dont have to pay any entry load. Investment in ELSS is also eligible for tax benefit under Section 80C and there is no capital gains tax if the units are held for more than 12 months.        
	The ultimate choice is yours. With more options at hand, you can now plan a secure future for yourself.

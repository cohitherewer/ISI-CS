          JAYANTA ROY CHOWDHURY AMP; PIYA SINGH                          Home truth                                  
	New Delhi/Mumbai, Aug. 13: House rents are expected to rise across the country, but landlords can still end up in big trouble with the taxman when the new tax code comes into effect.        
	Blame it all on a new way of calculating the rental income on which landlords must pay their taxes.        
	The code says the gross rent for calculating income tax will be based either on the rent that the house owner has contracted or on the presumptive rent, whichever is higher.        
	It is this concept of a presumptive rent that can spell trouble for landlords.        
	The tax code defines presumptive rent as 6 per cent of the rateable value of a property fixed by local authorities, or 6 per cent of the cost of buying or building the property.        
	This means if a flat costs Rs 50 lakh, its presumptive rent will be Rs 3 lakh, annually, or Rs 25,000 a month. Now even if the tenant is paying less than Rs 25,000 a month, landlords will have to pay tax on the higher presumptive rent.        
	Officials said: It has come to our notice that rental or lease agreements often understate the rent which is paid underhand or shown as payment for services. The difference between the actual rent and what is shown is often huge, running into tens of lakhs of rupees.         
	Rahul Garg, executive director of PricewaterhouseCoopers, says the government has come up with the concept of a presumptive tax to stem a rash of litigation that has arisen because of the earlier concept of a fair rental.        
	Garg said when the contracted rental was shown as less than what the taxman felt can be attained, he would compute the income on the basis of a so-called fair rental value which invariably led to a dispute.        
	The main area of dispute over the fair value of a property has been addressed by prescribing a presumptive tax rate, said Garg. But one needs to see whether the presumptive rate is disproportionately higher than the rental potential of the property.        
	Said Sudatto Sen, a senior practising chartered accountant: In most cities, the rateable values of flats and houses are reasonable and 6 per cent of that will more or less correspond to market rentals. But there can be two problems: first, old rentals, where the rents have not kept pace with the increase in value and, second, in places where rateable values have not been fixed and market acquisition costs are taken into account, this can increase the presumptive rent to unheard of levels.        
	For instance, in New Delhis tony neighbourhood of Greater Kailash a two-bedroom apartment will attract a rent of about Rs 30,000 a month, or Rs 3.6 lakh a year. The acquisition price of a two-bed flat will be close to about Rs 1.5 crore. Six per cent of that will mean an annual rent of Rs 9 lakh, said Sen.         
	However, the new code does give relief to landlords on interest payouts on money borrowed to buy or build a property given out on rent. While tax deductions from income on such interest payouts have been disallowed, the new tax code allows landlords to set off interest payments from their rent receipts for the purposes of tax calculations.         
	This in effect means the government is encouraging people to buy or build properties and put them on rent. This is a move probably taken to increase the stock of property in any given city, added Sen. The setoff provision will help owners of old buildings to rebuild or repair or renew their properties and gain tax exemptions on such repairs, officials said.        
	Interestingly, the new tax code even allows landlords to set off interest paid on money borrowed to repay past loans in buying or building flats.

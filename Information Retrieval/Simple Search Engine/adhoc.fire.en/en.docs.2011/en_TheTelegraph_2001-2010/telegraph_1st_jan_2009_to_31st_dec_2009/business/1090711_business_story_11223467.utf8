The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Worst over, says Montek
                                                                                                               Worst over, says Montek
          OUR BUREAU                          Montek: Happy                                  
	New Delhi, July 10: Planning Commission deputy chairman Montek Singh Ahluwalia today expressed satisfaction over the doubling of industrial growth in May over April to 2.7 per cent. He said the worst of the economic crisis was over but returning to robust growth would take time.        
	When asked whether the improvement in index of industrial production data indicated that the worst was over for industry, Ahluwalia said, We do believe that the worst is over. (But) there is a difference between the worst being over and getting back to robust growth. The real question is that how rapidly we resume growth.        
	About capital goods and non-durable consumer goods showing contraction in May, he said, I have not seen the entire data. But broadly we should see that the IIP has shown some improvement.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Bank is wrong
                                                                                                                 Q amp;A      Bank is wrong
                                I have a few fixed deposit accounts with the State Bank of India. Being a bachelor and a senior citizen, I approached the bank for a Form DA-1 so that I can make my niece the nominee. My niece holds a ration card, voter identity card and also a PAN. But the bank declined to accept my nomination because she doesnt have a savings bank account with the SBI. Is it mandatory to be a savings bank account holder for becoming a nominee?          Kaju Gupta, Nalhati
                    The bank is wrong. It is not mandatory that a person should have a savings account in a bank to become a nominee of an account holder in that bank. You make the application in writing and ask the bank to give it in written why they are turning down the nomination. Get an acknowledgement of receipt on a photocopy of your written application to the bank. If the bank doesnt reply to your satisfaction within a month of your application, you can approach the banking ombudsman at the regional office of the Reserve Bank of India for redress of your grievance. The ombudsman can also be approached through email or snail mail. The official website is: htttp://www.rbi.org.in/Scripts/bs_viewcontent.aspx?Id=159.                                  Loan worry      If I take a loan below Rs 19,000 from my relatives or friends in cash, shall I have to maintain any document? If yes, please let me know what type of document is accepted? Can I take a loan from a person who does not hold a PAN card?        Md. Shafiqul Haq, Barasat
                    Section 269SS of the Income Tax Act states that no person can receive loan or a deposit of Rs 20,000 or more in cash in aggregate in a year. The aggregate loan outstanding on the day of taking loan shall be taken into account for finding the limit. Similarly, you cannot repay any loan or deposit in cash above Rs 20,000. Similar strict rule applies under Section 269T. The penalty for contravention of Sections 269SS and 269T is 100 per cent of the loan taken or repaid. Therefore, one should always transact through account payee cheque or draft if the amount exceeds Rs 20,000. But for transactions less than Rs 20,000, you dont need to be extra careful. If you have taken a loan, just keep the loan agreement handy.

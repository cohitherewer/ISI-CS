The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | PF returns to stay intact
                                                                                                               PF returns to stay intact
          OUR BUREAU                          Pillai: Rate watch                                  
	New Delhi/Calcutta, June 22: The state-run employees provident fund is likely to continue paying an interest rate of 8.5 per cent to its 4-crore subscribers in 2009-10.        
	The central board of trustees of the Employees Provident Fund Organisation (EPFO) will meet on July 4 to take a call on the interest rate.        
	We will be looking at the possibility of retaining an 8.5 per cent rate, Sudha Pillai, labour secretary, said here today.         
	The EPFO, one of the largest provident fund institutions in the world in terms of constituent members and transactions handled, expects to earn Rs 12,994 crore in this fiscal.        
	Officials said the EPFO would manage to have a surplus of Rs 6.4 crore, if it paid its subscribers at an 8.5 per cent rate.        
	A small increase of 25 basis points, however, will lead to a deficit of Rs 366.77 crore; if the rate is 9 per cent, the losses will be Rs 739.94 crore.        
	This is the first time in seven years that the social security fund will be able to pay investors without dipping into its reserves. Officials said the introduction of three private sector fund managers in September 2008 to supplement public sector State Bank of India had given the fillip for better returns.        
	ICICI Prudential Asset Management, HSBC Asset Management and Reliance Asset Management were the three that got the mandate to manage the savings flowing into the EPFO. The trio along with the SBI earned returns of between 8.68 per cent and 9.14 per cent in 2008-09.        
	The EPFO invests about 80 per cent of its corpus in the central governments Special Deposit Scheme. The remaining 20 per cent is invested in bonds and other savings instruments of the government and state-run corporations, which fetch a slightly higher rate of interest.         
	Some 4.4-crore salaried and wage-earning individuals compulsorily invest in the EPFO and have been earning 8.5 per cent interest on their deposits since 2005-06.        
	Last year, the Left had sought a higher interest rate.        
	Unlike small savings where the the central government unilaterally decides interest rates, in the case of the EPFO the return is decided in consultation with the trustees.        
	The EPFOs decision, thus, has little bearing on the interest rates on small savings schemes.         
	Earlier, when the provident fund rates were reduced to 8.5 per cent from 9 per cent in 2005-06, small savings rates were not touched. These rates were last reduced in 2003.         
	Banks often cite the high interest rate of 8 per cent in small savings schemes for their inability to cut deposit and lending rates.         
	The argument is not fully justified.        
	Small savings schemes earning 8 per cent interest or more are NSC, Post Office Monthly Income Scheme, Kisan Vikas Patra and Senior Citizens Savings Scheme. Except for the senior citizen scheme, all the other plans mature between 6 years and 9 years.         
	Banks, too, are offering 8 per cent interest on deposits of over 8 years.         
	Post offices are giving between 6.25 per cent and 7.5 per cent interest on term deposits between 1 year and 5 years and these rates are on a par with those offered by banks.

	New Delhi, Sept. 8: Honda Siel Cars India (HSCI) today unveiled a new version of its sedan, the Civic, and said it would start exporting engine components to its parent firm  Honda Motor Company of Japan  from October.        
	The company launched the 1.8-litre Civic with an i-VTEC engine in three variants, priced between Rs 11.8 lakh and Rs 14.13 lakh (ex-showroom, Delhi).         
	Produced at the companys Greater Noida facility, 74 per cent of the components will be sourced locally. Honda has sold over 42,000 units of the Civic in India since its launch in 2006.         
	HSCI will export 60,000 sets of crank shafts and connecting rods from its second plant at Tapukara, Rajasthan, to the parent firm. A strong demand has constrained the operations of the Japanese facilities, HSCI president Masahiro Takedagawa said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Bharti roaming rates to spark fresh tariff tussle

          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Nov. 20: The telecom tariff wars have spilled into a new arena: roaming.        
	Telecom giant Bharti Airtel today slashed mobile roaming rates by over 60 per cent in an effort to wean away subscribers from rival operators.        
	Airtel is the countrys largest telecom operator with a subscriber base of 113.2 million. The new roaming plan  Airtel Turbo  offers incoming calls at 60 paise per minute.         
	Local and STD calls to Airtel connections will be charged at 60 paise per minute. Call made to other networks while roaming will cost 80 paise per minute.         
	For Airtel prepaid subscribers, the plan is available at Rs 98 per voucher which comes with a validity of one year. The plan is also being offered to post-paid subscribers.        
	Recent research has shown that customers need benefits while travelling and are not satisfied with just local calling benefits. Airtel is uniquely poised to be able to meet this need because of its seamless, formidable network presence across India, said Atul Bindal, president of mobile services at Bharti Airtel.        
	The telecom rate wars were triggered a couple of months ago when Tata Teleservices  in which Japanese giant NTT DoCoMo has a 26 per cent stake  aggressively launched a per second billing plan, prompting rivals to quickly follow suit.        
	DoCoMos aggressive advertising campaign has already paid off rich dividends: In October, Tata Teleservices had snared 3.8 million subscribers  the highest net additions among all telecom players for the third consecutive month.        
	Airtel managed to add only 2.7 million subscribers in October and figured third in the pecking order behind Vodafones 2.9 million.         
	Mobile service operators have been slashing rates and launching per second tariff plans to gain or retain customers as competition increases with at least four new companies, including Etisalat DB and Unitech Wireless, gearing up to start services later this year.        
	Most of the other GSM operators said they would study the market and then take a call on introducing new roaming tariff plans.                          
	At present, most GSM players, including Vodafone, Tata DoCoMo, Idea and Aircel, charge Re 1 for incoming calls while roaming.         
	Outgoing calls made to a local number is charged at Re 1, while an STD call costs Rs 1.50 per minute.        
	However, the Simply Reliance plan from Reliance Communications charges 50 paise for incoming and outgoing calls while roaming.        
	Analysts said the price war, aimed at grabbing new users ahead of fresh entrants waiting in the wings, could reduce Bhartis average revenue per user.        
	During the three months through September, it saw its ARPU dip to Rs 252 from Rs 278 in the April-June quarter. Its average minutes of usage per user also fell to 450 from 478.        
	However, the new plans may not hit revenues as the one-time enrolment charge, along with a rise in the number of minutes used by customers, is expected to offset the reduction in roaming rates, analysts added.        
	Roaming accounts for around 8 per cent of the companys revenue said Nishna Biyani, an analyst at brokerage Prabhudas Lilladher.        
	This is the second round of rate cuts from Bharti Airtel. It started offering a per-second billing plan to its customers in October, after Tata DoCoMo launched its per-second billing plan.

	New Delhi, Aug. 22: A breakthrough in the Doha round of trade talks is possible if players such as India, China and Brazil show greater responsibility, said WTO deputy director-general Harsha Vardhana Singh.        
	He urged countries to stop blaming each other and try to cooperate for the success of the talks.        
	We can do it by focusing in a constructive and creative way. The political emphasis is already there, what we require is substantive senior-level technical engagement. A constructive mindset, a willingness to get together and improve the situation is what we need today, Singh said at an industry event.        
	The two-day mini-ministerial WTO meeting next month will bring together trade ministers from nearly 40 developed and developing countries to iron out differences in perceptions and lay the groundwork for a balanced and successful outcome of the Doha Round.        
	The Doha negotiations reflect changes in the international political economy because of the growing importance of India, China and Brazil.         
	The main group in any multilateral negotiations will always include these countries, he said.        
	However, he said it was imperative that greater responsibility should fall on the shoulders of those who are given more authority.

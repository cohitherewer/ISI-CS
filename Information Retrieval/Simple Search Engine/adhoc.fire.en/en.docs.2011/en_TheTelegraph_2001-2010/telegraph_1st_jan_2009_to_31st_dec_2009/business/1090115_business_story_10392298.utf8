The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Clients face tough choice
                                                                                                               Clients face tough choice
          JAYATI GHOSE                          IN A DILEMMA                                  
	New Delhi, Jan. 14: Satyams ability to provide quality work at competitive rates makes it difficult for the companys clients to switch to another firm.        
	The services of Satyam cost 15-25 per cent less than other Indian, European and US firms. Infosys, in particular, may not be keen on Satyams customers as most of the contracts won by the Hyderabad firm are priced lower than what its peers in the industry charged, analysts at Edelweiss Securities said.        
	Sources said clients such as GE and Nestle were weighing all the pros and cons, especially higher billing rates and the ability of the new vendor to provide the kind of service they were used to from Satyam.        
	According to Sabyasachi S. Prasad, director of Mindplex Consulting, an offshore advisory firm, companies have failed to place attractive offers before Satyams clients.        
	Moreover, rival firms would not like to take up new clients at the cost of losing the confidence of the existing ones. Clients with Wipro, TCS and Infosys are concerned that the quality of their projects may suffer as new customers are brought in.         
	Satyams 690 clients also include Qantas and Fujitsu. Many of its customers are small firms that give it business worth $1-$5 million a year. Satyams mainstay is enterprise resource planning and solutions in manufacturing.        
	A report by CLSA Asia Pacific Markets said Satyam was different from other companies embroiled in accounting scams. The Indian firm potentially lacks cash assets to meet immediate commitments, including employee salaries for January and February.

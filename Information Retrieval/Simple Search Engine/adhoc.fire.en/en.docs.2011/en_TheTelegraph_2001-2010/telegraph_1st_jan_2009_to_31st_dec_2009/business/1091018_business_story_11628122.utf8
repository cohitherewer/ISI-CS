	Calcutta, Oct. 17: Precious metals dazzled during the Muhurat trading session today to mark an auspicious beginning of Samvat 2066.         
	The price of 24-carat gold rose by Rs 65 to Rs 16,140 per 10 gm, while silver increased by Rs 250 to Rs 27,250 per kg.         
	However, trading volume remained thin because of the high prices of the precious metals.         
	The price spurt was driven by strong global cues.         
	In the overseas markets, gold price soared by $2.20 to $1052.80 per troy ounce on the back of a falling dollar.        
	Silver price surged marginally by 0.80 cents to $17.42.         
	Strong demand from retailers also pushed up prices.         
	Buying gold and silver during Diwali is considered to be auspicious by many. People also buy the precious metals as gifts.        
	Dhanteras saw brisk sale of gold and silver at the retail level.         
	Standard gold and ornaments in Mumbai, the largest bullion market in the country, traded Rs 50 higher at Rs 16,070 and Rs 15,920 per 10 gram, respectively.        
	Silver ready closed Rs 25 higher at Rs 26,925 per kg on increased offtake by industrial units and coin makers to meet the current festive season demand.         
	Silver weekly-based delivery shot up Rs 175 to Rs 26,900 per kg.         
	Silver coins were up by Rs 100 at Rs 32,900 for buying and Rs 33,000 for selling of 100 pieces.        
	On the Multi-Commodity Exchange, gold futures rose marginally in Muhurat trading.

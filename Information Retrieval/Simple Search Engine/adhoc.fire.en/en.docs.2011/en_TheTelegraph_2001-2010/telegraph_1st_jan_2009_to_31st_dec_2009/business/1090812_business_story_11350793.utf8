The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Srei SEZ plan gets a breather
                                                                                                               Srei SEZ plan gets a breather
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Aug. 11: The government today granted Srei Infrastructure Development an extension till June next year to acquire land for an auto component special economic zone in Bengal.        
	The board of approval headed by commerce secretary Rahul Khullar extended the in-principle clearance to Srei. Sources said land for the proposed SEZ was expected to be acquired soon.        
	The extension was granted after the West Bengal Industrial Infrastructure Development Corporation told the board that Bengal Integrated Auto Industrial Park  the joint venture company of the developer  had purchased 33.47 hectares and proposed to buy another 25.04 hectares in the next few months.         
	After the purchase, the developer will have 58.5 hectares out of the 100 hectares planned for the SEZ.        
	SEZs with in-principle approval will have to complete land acquisition within a year. A formally approved SEZ with land under possession has to operationalise the tax-free enclave within three years.        
	The government also allowed Maytas Ventures  promoted by the kin of disgraced Satyam founder Ramalinga Raju  to surrender its biotech SEZ and approved three new proposals, including that of Brooke Bond Real Estates IT/ITeS zone in Karnataka. Khullar permitted Hyderabad-based Maytas to withdraw its SEZ provided the company refunded the Rs 31-lakh service tax exemption.        
	The board deferred a decision on giving Mukesh Ambani-promoted Reliance Haryana SEZ more time to complete a multi-product zone at Gurgaon, an official said.         
	The developers have already been given two extensions.

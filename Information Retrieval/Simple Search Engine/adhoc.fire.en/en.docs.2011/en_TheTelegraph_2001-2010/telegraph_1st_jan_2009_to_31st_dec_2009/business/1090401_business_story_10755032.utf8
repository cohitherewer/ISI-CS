The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Debate over customs duty enters Supreme Court
                                                                                                               Debate over customs duty enters Supreme Court
          OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT                               
	New Delhi, March 31: The movement of goods by an industrial house from one unit in a domestic tariff area to another unit in a special economic zone (SEZ) has sparked off a duty debate.         
	The Union government has now left it to the Supreme Court to decide whether such movements of goods by an industrial unit will attract customs levy.        
	The commerce ministry feels such trade, even if it is between different units of the same industrial entity, is liable to attract customs duty.        
	Accordingly it has dragged the Essar group to the Supreme Court, alleging that iron ore pellets and calibrated iron ore supplied by an Essar unit to the Essar SEZ at Hazira are goods exported from India for the purpose of such levy.        
	A bench headed by Justice S. H. Kapadia has adjourned the matter till April 9.        
	A petition filed by the ministry has challenged Gujarat High Courts interim order that allowed Essar Steel to continue its arrangement without paying customs duty on goods supplied from its domestic tariff area (DTA) unit in Visakhapatnam to the Hazira SEZ unit.        
	The high court had ordered that Essar was not liable to pay customs duty in the absence of any specific provisions under the SEZ Act, 2005, to levy customs duty or any corresponding amendment to the Customs Act, 1962.         
	According to the government, the Directorate of Revenue Intelligence had found that ESTL (the Essar unit) had been supplying iron ore and calibrated iron ore to Essar Steel without paying export duty and the goods were to be termed as exports.        
	It also stated that customs duty was not exempted for goods supplied from a DTA to an SEZ unit.        
	SEZs, according to the government, are to be considered as territory outside India, and goods supplied to a unit in an SEZ are treated as exports and the corresponding benefits such as excise duty exemptions on goods from a DTA to SEZ units, drawback facilities, etc are also provided.        
	...If the export implies only export out of India, then supplies to SEZs from DTA would not be export out of India and no rebate under these rules would be admissible, the petition stated.        
	Essar had moved the high court seeking to restrain the government from levying and demanding export duty on goods sent from ESTL to the Essar SEZ. It had argued that the SEZ act was a complete law and there was no provision for levying such export duty on the goods supplied to a unit in an SEZ. Essar had stated that the SEZ unit was located in India and, therefore, supplies to such a unit cannot be considered as goods exported from India.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | RBI wake-up call on inflation 
                                                                                                               RBI wake-up call on inflation 
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                            
	Mumbai, July 27: Inflation will torment the country in the second half of the year.        
	Thats no longer a gloomy forecast by number-crunching economists; it is a fear that the Reserve Bank of India has officially articulated for the first time this year.        
	The bugbear  which had been thrown off our backs in early June when inflation turned negative for the first time after a gap 30 years  could return to haunt monetary policy makers at the central bank once again.        
	In a document released a day before it hunkers down to review its monetary policy at the end of the first quarter, the RBI said there were indications that inflation could firm up again by the end of this year.        
	Since September last year, the RBI had changed tack and had aggressively started trimming interest rates to jump-start a faltering economy as inflation started weakening and appeared to be less of a concern. But with the economy starting to lurch into forward drive, the RBI may have to start devising way to put a lid on inflation.         
	The visible signs of price pressures, even as the headline inflation number turned negative over the short-run, pose complex challenges for the conduct of monetary policy, particularly given the dampened domestic demand conditions, the RBI said.        
	High commodity prices and the delayed monsoon could exert pressure on food prices.        
	Moreover, the high base effect, which has been cited as one of the major reasons for the lower levels of inflation, will almost disappear by October. It cautioned that fiscal stimulus and its accommodative monetary policy could have inflationary implications if they are sustained longer.        
	The RBI said kharif production, which accounted for about 57 per cent of the overall agricultural output, could be affected. The worst hit kharif crops could be rice, tur, urad, maize and soyabean which are all monsoon-dependent. However, rainfall in July has been relatively good and the improved sowing position as on July 17 indicates that sowing of most pulses, oilseeds and coarse cereals are close to last years levels.        
	Growing economy         
	Many expect the RBI to raise its growth forecast for the economy from the 6 per cent it forecast in April. In 2008-09, the country had achieved a GDP growth of 6.7 per cent after three straight years of over 9 per cent growth.        
	The return of the growth phase is predicated on a set of positives that the RBI listed out in the document titled Macroeconomic and Monetary Developments: First Quarter Review 2009-10.        
	These include a positive growth in the index of industrial production (IIP) in April-May 2009, higher growth in the core infrastructure sector and some indications of an upsurge in the services sector that accounts for over 55 per cent of the countrys GDP.        
	There are other cues as well. A survey of professional forecasters conducted by the apex bank in June 2009 placed the growth rate for 2009-10 at 6.5 per cent, higher than 5.7 per cent in an earlier survey.        
	The RBI said non-food credit growth was turning positive since the beginning of June 2009 and the year-on-year deceleration in credit growth had shown a modest reversal since the last fortnight of June.        
	Moreover, capital flows had increased after two consecutive quarters of net outflows.        
	Early information on the corporate performance for the first quarter of 2009-10 is indicating positive growth in both sales and profits over the corresponding period of the previous year, it noted.        
	Since October last year, the RBI has brought down the repo rate by 425 basis points and the reverse repo by 275 basis points to 4.75 per cent and 3.25 per cent, respectively.         
	The repo is the rate at which RBI provides funds to banks against the government securities they hold. The reverse repo is the rate at which it absorbs liquidity.         
	However, bankers do not expect any change in these key rates tomorrow.

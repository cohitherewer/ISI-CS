The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Fresh Taro move to block Sun bid
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Fresh Taro move to block Sun bid
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Mumbai, Dec. 11: Israeli drug firm Taro Pharmaceutical Industries has asked its shareholders to reject a takeover bid by Indias Sun Pharma, ahead of Taros annual general meeting on December 31.        
	Taro warned its shareholders that if Sun was successful in its bid, the Israeli firm might be in a position similar to the beleaguered Caraco Pharmaceutical Laboratories.        
	Sun has been bad for Caraco and Sun could be a disaster for your investment in Taro, Taro chairman and managing director Barrie Levitt said in a letter to shareholders.        
	Levitts statement comes after Templeton Asset Management Company, a key investor in Taro, supported Sun Pharmas move to acquire the Israeli drug company. Templeton holds 10 per cent in Taro.        
	Sun had acquired a majority stake in Caraco in 2004. In June, the US regulators banned Caraco from selling drugs made at its three American plants after citing deviations from manufacturing standards.        
	You should be aware of the serious corporate governance and legal controversies facing Sun as a result of its stewardship of Caraco, a US-based company in which Sun controls majority of the shares, Levitt said.        
	Suns conduct at Caraco raises serious questions about what may happen to minority shareholders of Taro if Sun is able to gain control of your company, Levitt added.        
	Levitt, in his letter, also said that in the last 18 months, Caracos stock price has declined over 65 per cent to $5.89 from $17.22 as on May 30, 2008. This prompted unhappy Caraco shareholders to file lawsuits.        
	On December 8, Levitt had written another letter to the shareholders alleging that Sun was attempting to gain control by waging a proxy war.

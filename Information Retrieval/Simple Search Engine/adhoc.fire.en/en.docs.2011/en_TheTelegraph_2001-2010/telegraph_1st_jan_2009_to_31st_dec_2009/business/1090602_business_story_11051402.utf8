	Calcutta, June 1: General Motors (GM) India today assured car owners that there was no reason to panic.         
	Indian business is self-sufficient as it is making operational profits for some years now and is insulated from the US bankruptcy, GM group vice-president Nick Reilly said.        
	The bankruptcy proceedings are only for the reinvention of the US operations of GM. In the US, Chapter 11 is used to make a brand more stronger to suit the changing business environment. Therefore, it will only make GM stronger, GM India said.        
	We believe this step is the most efficient and effective means for GM to quickly achieve a competitive and profitable future, Reilly said.        
	Most of GMs planned investments in India have already been made and the company is firmly committed to the market, customers and suppliers, GM India said.

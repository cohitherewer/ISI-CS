                                                                                                               New norms for auditors
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, March 9: The Institute of Chartered Accountants of India has made it mandatory for auditors to certify annual reports.        
	They will have to verify the entire report  which is sent to the shareholders  to identify inconsistencies, if any, vis-a-vis the financial statements.        
	Chartered accountants verify financial statements such as the balance sheet and profit and loss account. They are not responsible for other statements appearing in the annual reports. The new standards are expected to prevent a repeat of Satyam.        
	ICAI sources said that the institute was likely to come out with more guidelines which would make auditing more strict.

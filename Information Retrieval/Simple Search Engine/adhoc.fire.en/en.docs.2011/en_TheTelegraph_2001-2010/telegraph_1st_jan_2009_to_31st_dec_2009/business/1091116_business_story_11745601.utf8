          SOUNAK MITRA                           Expansion mode                                  
	Calcutta, Nov. 15: Kishore Biyanis Future Brands is planning to license out some of its private labels to the mainstream retail industry in 2010-11.        
	We are now looking at ways in which brands can be taken forward through newer licensing and franchise arrangements. We will also have to find out the legal framework within which one can operate, Anand Pandey, vice-president of Future Brands, told The Telegraph.         
	So far, brands such as John Miller, DJ amp;C, Bare and Dreamline were retailed at Future Groups own chains  Big Bazaar, Central and Pantaloons.         
	We plan to expand our brands outside Future Group through the licensing route, he said.         
	According to Pandey, if the company decides to licence out John Miller to a third party, the licensee will make products that are synergistic with its core brand value.         
	The products can be shoes or accessories. We would, in return, get a fee for licensing out the brand, Pandey said.         
	The brand development and marketing arm of Future Group is also planning to create a separate vertical to enter the intellectual property rights space.         
	The company has set up newer business verticals such as brand consultancy, brand partnerships and insight and research.         
	It has been revamping some of the under-performing brands within the group and upgrading a few to the national level.        
	Pandey said Future Brands planned to explore and provide consultancy to foreign companies. The aim is to help overseas players define their India entry strategy and apply it to their business models, he said.         
	Future Brands is already doing a host of consultancy projects for Titan, Fastrack, Dabur (Odonil), Godfrey Philips, Wild Stone and Godrej Sara Lee.         
	Its biggest client is Titan where the consulting division has helped to sharpen the focus of the brand.

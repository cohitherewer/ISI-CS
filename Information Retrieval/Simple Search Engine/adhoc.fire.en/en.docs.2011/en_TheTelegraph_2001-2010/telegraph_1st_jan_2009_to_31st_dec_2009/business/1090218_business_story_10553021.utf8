The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Subhiksha weighs FDI option
                                                                                                               Subhiksha weighs FDI option
          R. SURYAMURTHY                          Awaiting lifeline                                  
	New Delhi, Feb. 17: Subhiksha Trading Services  the distressed discount retailer  is hoping to test the limits of the new relaxations in the guidelines for foreign direct investment.        
	Subhiksha aims to raise funds from overseas investors in its holding company.         
	The new guidelines permit FDI in retail through the holding company route. We will examine the prospect of using this route to raise capital at the holding company level, R. Subramanian, managing director of Subhiksha, told The Telegraph.        
	He said several overseas investors were interested in equity. We will consider their proposals after the debt restructuring is over.         
	The government, however, continues to frown on foreign investment in multi-brand retail.        
	Last week, the government said foreign investment in holding or investing companies owned and controlled by resident Indians would not be taken into account while computing the foreign stake in an operational subsidiary belonging to an industry where sectoral caps exist.        
	Many saw this as a backdoor entry for foreign investors into retail. However, minister of state for industry Ashwini Kumar said in the Lok Sabha today, The sectoral cap in (multi-brand) retail remains. There is no question of indirect investment. The new guideline does not change the sectoral cap; there is no confusion.         
	Stressed retailers such as Subhiksha are looking for a lifeline  and will hope to test their interpretation of the guidelines that are curiously silent on this aspect.        
	Subramanian said lenders would decide on rescheduling loans amounting to Rs 750 crore by the end of April.

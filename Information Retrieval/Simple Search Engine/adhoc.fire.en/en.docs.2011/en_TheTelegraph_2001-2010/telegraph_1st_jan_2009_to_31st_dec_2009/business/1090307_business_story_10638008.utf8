                                                                                                               ICICI prunes home loan rates
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Mumbai, March 6: ICICI Bank, the countrys largest private sector bank, today reduced interest rates on new home loans by 25-50 basis points.        
	The rate cut, to be effective immediately, comes after the RBI brought down both the repo and the reverse repo rates by 50 basis points each on Wednesday.         
	Sources said for home loans below Rs 20 lakh, the new interest rate would be 9.75 per cent compared with 10 per cent earlier.         
	The interest rate for loans in the range of Rs 20-30 lakh has been reduced to 10 per cent from 10.5 per cent, while for loans above Rs 30 lakh, it has been trimmed to 11.5 per cent from 12 per cent.         
	In December last year, the private sector bank reduced the benchmark floating reference rate by 50 basis points to 13.75 per cent, a move that benefited existing customers.         
	ICICI Bank, however, is yet to catch up with its public sector rivals in offering attractive interest rates.         
	The State Bank of India is offering an 8 per cent interest rate on home loans for a period of one year.        
	Canara Bank had announced that home loans up to Rs 30 lakh would be available at 8.25 per cent interest for the next 12 months and 9.25 per cent for the next 48 months. Thereafter, the rate will be the prime lending rate minus 2.50 per cent subject to a minimum of 10 per cent.         
	Bank of Baroda will also bring down its prime lending rate by half a percentage point to 12 per cent, effective from next month.         
	The move will reduce the interest burden on all advances linked to the prime lending rate, including home loans.

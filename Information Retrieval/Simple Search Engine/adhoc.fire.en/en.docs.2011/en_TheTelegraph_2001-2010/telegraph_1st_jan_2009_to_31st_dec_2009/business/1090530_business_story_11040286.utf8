The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Raja to speed up 3G auction, cut tariff
                                                                                                               Raja to speed up 3G auction, cut tariff
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                          Raja: Showing promise                                  
	New Delhi, May 29: Andimuthu Raja, who is back as the telecom and information technology minister for the second successive term, plans to expedite third generation (3G) licence auction and reduce mobile tariffs.         
	The auction of 3G licences and radiowaves would enable a mobile user to enjoy high-speed Internet and video conferencing, while fetching at least Rs 30,000 crore to the government and helping it to narrow a widening fiscal deficit.         
	The auction of 3G spectrum is on top of my priority list, Raja told reporters here. He will take charge next week.         
	Raja will also focus on cutting mobile tariffs to 10 paise a minute for local calls, pushing for the extension of IT tax benefits and implementing number portability as well as mobile virtual network operations.         
	Analysts said the minister also needed to resolve the issue of second generation (2G) spectrum allocation.         
	Currently, operators become eligible for additional spectrum through subscriber-based criteria.         
	However, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh has always been in favour of the auction route.         
	On mobile call rates, Raja said he planned to bring down local rates to 10 paise a minute and STD rates to 25 paise a minute.         
	At present, cellphone users pay 40 paise to Re 1 per minute to make local calls and Re 1 to Rs 2 a minute for national calls.        
	Raja feels there is enough scope for tariffs to come down and the policies followed during his previous stint will help in achieving this.                                      
	The minister added that, introduction of IT at the lowest level in government to make possible paperless functioning is also on his agenda. Moreover, he would also push for extension of tax sops for the IT and ITes sector.              
	I will speak to the Prime Minister and the Finance Minister to extend the STPI benefits, said Raja.              
	Companies located in software technology park of India (STPI) are not taxed on revenues earned from exporting software (which includes writing codes or computers of US amp; UK companies). The incentive is available till March 2010. There are more than 8,000 STPI-registered units spread across the country.              
	DoT officials said the minister would also be looking at implementing mobile number portability before the year-end. BSNLs listing is also on the cards, and a long pending demand by the industry to reduce and simplify the existing levy structure would also be discussed.              
	EOM

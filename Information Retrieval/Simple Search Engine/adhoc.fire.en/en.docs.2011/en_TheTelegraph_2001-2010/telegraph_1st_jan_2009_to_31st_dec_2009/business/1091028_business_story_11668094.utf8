The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Subbarao gets a pat from Pranab
                                                                                                               Subbarao gets a pat from Pranab
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                          Mukherjee: Supportive                                  
	New Delhi, Oct. 27: Finance minister Pranab Mukherjee today said the Reserve Banks monetary policy review was on expected lines and in tandem with the Centres fiscal policy.        
	Both the fiscal and monetary policies are in close conformity with each other, Mukherjee told reporters after the policy review by RBI governor D. Subbarao in Mumbai.        
	The rates had been discussed with the Reserve Bank earlier. The RBI governor had met me a few days back. We had discussed and he indicated there would be no change in the rates, the finance minister said.        
	Finance secretary Ashok Chawla said the decision to keep almost all the key rates unchanged, barring SLR, would send a positive signal.        
	The economy is on a comeback track but there is a need for a more definite and robust signal, which is what the RBI has responded to. The continuation of the policy will serve industry and business well in the months ahead, he said.        
	Mukherjee said the easy monetary policy was likely to continue until economic recovery was firm.         
	He said the economy was responding well to the fiscal and monetary steps and likely to expand 6.5-6.75 per cent during the current financial year.        
	In its review, the central bank had retained its earlier forecast of 6 per cent growth for 2009-10.        
	Mukherjee said robust growth in exports was unlikely in the absence of recover in the world economy, particularly in Europe and North America.        
	But the encouraging trend is that the rate of decline, which was very high in the earlier months, has reduced though it still continues to be negative, he said.        
	The apex bank today raised the statutory liquidity ratio by one percentage points to 25 per cent.        
	SLR is something which does not really affect the ground reality. As of today the banks are already operating at more than 25 per cent SLR, said Chawla.

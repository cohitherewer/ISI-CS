The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Agreement this week on spectrum use
                                                                                                               Agreement this week on spectrum use
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                          SEEKING SOLUTION                                  
	New Delhi, Feb. 23: The department of telecom and the defence ministry are expected to sign an agreement this week on the vacation of spectrum for civilian use.        
	Both the parties met today to discuss the arrangement, including spectrum to be released initially. Spectrum, or radio waves, is a scarce resource through which the communication signals of cellular firms travel.        
	Officials said defence was willing to vacate only 10 megahertz in the 2.1 gigahertz band, which could be used for 3G.        
	Telecom experts said vacating spectrum for 3G did not make sense as the auctions had been postponed. The auction was earlier scheduled for January.        
	Last week, a group of ministers headed by external affairs minister Pranab Mukherjee had asked defence to vacate 15Mhz of spectrum.        
	Telecom minister A. Raja said, We will sign the memorandum of understanding with the defence ministry. Defence will release 10-15Mhz of spectrum the day the agreement is signed.         
	The government has missed at least two deadlines for resolving the issue of defence vacating spectrum.        
	According to the experts, defence does not utilise spectrum efficiently, and its requirement can be met by an optical fibre network.        
	Officials said defence was in a position to meet the DoTs requirements of 50Mhz in 3-4 years.         
	All depends on the fibre network, which will cost the DoT Rs 14,000 crore.        
	State-owned BSNL is setting up the platform, which is expected to be complete by 2011.        
	The group of ministers wanted 10Mhz for 3G and 5Mhz for 2G, while the DoTs demand is 30Mhz for 3G and 20Mhz for 2G.

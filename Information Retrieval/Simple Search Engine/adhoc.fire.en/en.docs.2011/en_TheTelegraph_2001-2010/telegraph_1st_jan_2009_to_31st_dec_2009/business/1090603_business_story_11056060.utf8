                                                                                                               Core growth stokes recovery hopes
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                            
	New Delhi, June 2: The six industries making up the core sector grew 4.3 per cent in April against 2.8 per cent a year ago  a sign of recovery, according to analysts.        
	We are on the path of recovery and the data clearly indicates that, Suresh D. Tendulkar, chairman of the Prime Ministers Economic Advisory Council, told The Telegraph.        
	Recovery would be slow till September, by when the stimulus packages, monetary policy and the interest rate cuts would start showing results, he said.        
	The six industries have a combined weight of 26 per cent in the index of industrial production.        
	The positive numbers in the core sector come within days of government data revealing that India recorded a 6.7 per cent GDP growth during 2007-08, despite the global crisis.        
	State-run Steel Authority of India Ltd said its May sales rose 12 per cent from a year earlier to about 1 million tonnes. Saleable steel production in the month was 1.1 million tonnes, up 5 per cent from a year earlier.        
	The optimism of Tendulkar was not shared by other economists, who, however, agreed that the rebound in domestic demand would be faster than expected.        
	N.R. Bhanumurthy of the Institute of Economic Growth said: It is too early to say the economy is on a recovery path as exports have done badly during April. There seems to be some kind of mismatch as conditions like demand, interest rates or investments have not changed in a big way, he said.        
	Indias exports fell 33.2 per cent in April, the biggest drop in 14 years and the seventh consecutive monthly contraction, as the global recession slashed the demand for the nations jewellery, clothing and other products.

	Calcutta, Feb. 3: Thermal power producers should develop the captive coal blocks allotted to them and chalk out their capacity expansion plan accordingly, Coal India chairman Partha S. Bhattacharyya said today.         
	Power generation companies import 3-4 million tonnes (mt) of coal every month. They should plan most of their coal imports in the first half of the year when domestic coal production is low and rail rakes are available to transport the imported coal from ports, he said.         
	Coal production in the country picks up in the second half and we need more rail rakes to supply to power stations. But if the rakes are busy transporting imported coal, it creates a supply shortage.        
	Bhattacharyya said CIL had exceeded its supply target to power firms as set in the annual action plan by the Planning Commission. In fact, this year we expect to supply 2-3mt more than the target, he said.        
	However, the Bengal power ministry and the West Bengal Power Development Corporation had complained that the quality of coal supplied by CIL had deteriorated over the last few years. The units now need more coal to produce each mega-watt of power.         
	Bhattacharyya said the ash content in Indian coal was generally very high. But they are getting it at less than $10 a tonne compared with the import price of more than $80 a tonne, he said.        
	CIL has produced 316.45 mt coal between April and January in the current fiscal compared with 295.37mt in the same period a year ago.         
	Coal offtake during the period has also gone up 7.1 per cent to 327.59mt from 305.85mt, Bhattacharyya said.

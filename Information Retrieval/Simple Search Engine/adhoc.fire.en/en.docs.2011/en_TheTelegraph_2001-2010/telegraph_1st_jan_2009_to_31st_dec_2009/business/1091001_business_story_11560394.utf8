The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Strong rally takes sensex past 17K
                                                                                                               Strong rally takes sensex past 17K
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                            
	Mumbai, Sept. 30: The sensex rocketed past 17000 today after a gap of almost 17 months, soothing investor worries about a sharp correction after a phenomenal bull run since March.         
	The bellwether index closed at 17126.84, a gain of 273.93 points or 1.63 per cent  its highest close since May 20, 2008.        
	Brokers said the surge was fuelled by optimism that India Inc would unveil another robust set of numbers when they declare financial results for the quarter ended September 30. The earnings season will commence next month with Infosys Technologies set to declare its numbers on October 9.        
	Brokers said the rally was triggered by strong money flows from foreign institutional investors (FIIs). India has attracted around Rs 58,000 crore from foreign investors since January. This is more than the Rs 55,000 crore of FII outflow which we saw last year, D.D. Sharma, vice-president (research) at Anand Rathi Financial Services, told The Telegraph.        
	The impact of this liquidity flow can be gauged from the movement of the sensex this year. Since January 1, the benchmark index has gained 73 per cent.         
	The bourses opened strong today even though the Dow Jones Industrial Average had closed lower yesterday. The sensex opened at 16868.46 and then consolidated its gains rapidly as the day progressed. With the European markets opening in the green and indications that the US markets could also move higher, the index hit an intra-day peak of 17142.52. Market circles added that Oil Indias strong listing also buoyed sentiment.        
	The BSE Bankex recorded the sharpest gain among the sectoral indices, aided by the sturdy showing by ICICI Bank and the State Bank of India. Shares of ICICI Bank rose 4.6 per cent to Rs 904.80, while the SBI gained 5 per cent at Rs 2,195.70.

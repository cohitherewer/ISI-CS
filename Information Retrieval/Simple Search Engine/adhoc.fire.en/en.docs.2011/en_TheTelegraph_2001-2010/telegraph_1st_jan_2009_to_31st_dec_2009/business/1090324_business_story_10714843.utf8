The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Acid test for used cars 
                                                                                                               Acid test for used cars 
          GARIMA SINGH NEOGY                              
	New Delhi, March 23: Firms in the second-hand car market are keeping a close eye on the developments following the launch of the Nano.        
	Maruti Suzuki India said the Rs 1-lakh Nano had not affected the sale or pricing of its used cars.         
	The company is into second-hand cars since 2001 through its True Value dealer network.        
	We have been able to retail whatever we are buying. We are even unable to meet the demand sometimes. There has been no significant change in the resale prices of cars in the last four months, said Ravi Bhatia, chief general manager of True Value.         
	True Value, which has a 10 per cent market share in the used-car business, has 302 outlets.        
	In January and February, sales grew 22 per cent and 25 per cent, respectively, over the last year.        
	Bhatia said that following the launch of the Nano, True Value was carefully monitoring the situation vis--vis prices and sales. Yes, we will have to wait and watch.         
	Auto analysts said the Nano would have little impact on sales.        
	The Nano will open up a new segment and is not likely to eat into the used-car market. If at all, it will have a very minimal impact. People who go for second-hand cars are the ones who have little money and not much time, said auto analyst Hormazd Sorabji.         
	Unlike the old cars, the waiting period for the Nano is much longer.        
	Korean car manufacturer Hyundai Motors India (HMI), which recently started selling used cars, said there had not been any drop in prices.        
	Our business is too new and we have low volumes. It is growing and we dont expect to witness any drop in the prices even after the Nano, said a Hyundai spokesperson.         
	As the slowdown spread and put a brake on new sales, companies started concentrating on used cars.        
	Tata Motors has Tata Motors Assured, launched on a pilot basis with 15 dealers in 10 cities  Mumbai, Delhi, Bangalore, Hyderabad, Chennai, Pune, Ahmedabad, Chandigarh, Ludhiana and Vapi.         
	General Motors India is also gearing up to enter the segment. It plans to launch the Chevrolet OK scheme in phases. German firms Audi, BMW and Porsche are also keen to carve up a slice of the business.         
	Toyota and Mahindra amp; Mahindra also sell second-hand cars.                                      
	In 2007-08, there was a small difference between the sales of new and used cars  1.5 million of the former were sold against 1.4 million second-hands.

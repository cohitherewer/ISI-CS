          OUR CORRESPONDENT                          Awaiting relief                                  
	New Delhi, July 7: Finance minister Pranab Mukherjee said he would revisit the demands of the hospitality industry and consider sops for affordable housing to the poor.        
	In his post-budget interaction with industrialists, Mukherjee said, There is a case. Let me revisit it once again. I shall have to look into it, but cannot promise anything.         
	The industry had demanded infrastructure status and tax breaks.         
	To what extent can I provide some incentives, I cant comment, he said. He was responding to a suggestion made by Jyotsna Suri, chairperson and managing director of Bharat Hotels.         
	Suri said the hospitality industry provided six per cent of the total employment in the country and contributed Rs 50,000 crore in foreign exchange in 2008-09. It is unfair that our industry is completely ignored.        
	She said the government should also provide tax holidays to the new hotels under construction. The industry was disappointed with the budget because it did not find mention in the finance ministers speech.        
	The budget did not give the hospitality and tourism industry the importance that it deserves, especially when the country expects us to generate more and more jobs, said M.P. Purushothaman, president of the Federation of Hotel and Restaurant Association of India.        
	Industry had also demanded tax sops for building houses for the poor. This is much needed. It will also accelerate GDP growth, said Godrej group chairman Adi Godrej.        
	Mukherjee, who allocated around Rs 4,000 crore for providing housing and basic amenities to the urban poor in the budget, said, we will look into it.

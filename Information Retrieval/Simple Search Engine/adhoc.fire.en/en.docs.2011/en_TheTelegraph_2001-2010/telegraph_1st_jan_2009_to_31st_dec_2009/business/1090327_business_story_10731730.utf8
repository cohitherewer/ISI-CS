The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Suitors get to vet limited Satyam data
                                                                                                               Suitors get to vet limited Satyam data
          OUR BUREAU                          Watchful                                   
	March 26: The board of Satyam Computer Services is offering limited information to bidders during the due diligence exercise, which began today and was expected to be completed by next week.        
	Sources close to the board said the information on offer related to clients and financials. However, information on both is aggregated, more indicative of a trend rather than actual details.        
	For instance, sources said, confidentiality agreements prevented Satyam from revealing the identity of the clients to the bidders.        
	Instead, they are getting country- and vertical-specific information on clients.        
	Therefore, the bidders will only get an idea of the business from the US or the profile and number of customers in a vertical such as banking, financial services and insurance.        
	Similarly, the third-quarter results or the true financial numbers of the previous 1-2 years will not be available.        
	The bidders will, however, have an idea of the order book and the billing rates for different contracts.        
	Satyam chairman Kiran Karnik refused to elaborate on the information for the bidders. The board will not comment on the bidding process, he said. Spice Corp  a bidder  has criticised the process, alleging an absence of transparency.        
	Investment bankers and analysts have even questioned restricting the information to the bidders. They say Satyam is a listed entity and there is a strong case for a wider sharing of information.        
	Supporters of the board decision to limit information have advanced two arguments.         
	Firstly, the accounts are still being restated and will take time. Second, the clients and associates of Satyam have told the company not to share information.        
	Many clients have non-disclosure agreements. The board is also reluctant to part with information that may compromise the investigations of the agencies probing into the massive Rs 7,100-crore fraud perpetrated by Satyam founder B. Ramalinga Raju. CBI, one of the agencies, is claiming that the size of the fraud is much higher  at around Rs 10,000 crore.        
	Meanwhile Maytas Infrastructure, promoted by a Raju kin, today said its independent director R.P. Raju had resigned.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Parsons to be Citi chairman
                                                                                                               Parsons to be Citi chairman

	New York, Jan. 22: Richard D. Parsons swatted down talk last November that he might become the chairman of Citigroup, the struggling financial giant. I have every confidence that we have the right team on the field to pull this thing out, Parsons, then chairman of Warner and a Citigroup director, said in a CNBC interview.         
	But on Wednesday, Parsons got the job  the latest task in a seemingly charmed life in which his gregariousness and smooth personality have placed him at the centre of events and made him a candidate for high positions. He succeeds Winfried F. W. Bischoff, a longtime Citigroup banker who presided over an increasingly fractious board.         
	The appointment will put to use Parsonss ties to the Obama administration  he was a member of President Obamas transition economic advisory board  as well as his experience in running companies under the federal governments microscope. But it will also most likely offend some on Wall Street who are calling for a more radical shake-up at Citigroup.        
	Formed a decade ago in a merger that brought a range of financial services under one roof, Citigroup has received two bailouts from the government and announced plans last week to split itself in two. The company lost more than $8 billion last quarter, and its stock price has plunged nearly 85 per cent in the last year.         
	The investors, Citi shareholders, have strong views that theres been a lack of accountability at the board, said John McDonald, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein.         
	In an interview on Wednesday, Parsons said he viewed the chairmanship of Citigroup as a form of public service, an important role in not just stabilising Citigroup but the financial system in general.

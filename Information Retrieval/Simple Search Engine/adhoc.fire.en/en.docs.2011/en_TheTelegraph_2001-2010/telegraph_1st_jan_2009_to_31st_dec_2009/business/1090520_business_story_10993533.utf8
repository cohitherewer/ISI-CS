The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Cash chase gathers momentum
                                                                                                               Cash chase gathers momentum
          PIYA SINGH                      Fund Raiser                          
	Mumbai, May 19: A day after the dull share markets sprang back to life, several large companies have started to tap the equity route to raise big bucks to meet their capital expenditure needs and retire old debt.        
	Reliance Power is expected to raise Rs 3,000 crore by placing 20 crore shares at Rs 150 each through the book-building route, said sources.        
	The Reliance Power share closed at Rs 162.40 on Tuesday, an increase of 6.32 per cent over the previous close on the Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE).        
	Indiabulls Real Estate Ltd has raised $550 million by pricing the deal at Rs 185 per share. The company received a very positive response to the qualified institutional placement (QIP) on Monday, market sources said. Morgan Stanley was the lead manager of the QIP issue.        
	The Indiabulls Real Estate stock closed at Rs 199.75 on Tuesday on the BSE, up 1.14 per cent over the previous close.        
	The board of Essar Oil has also informed the BSE that it will seek shareholders approval to extend the validity of its resolution to issue shares. The notice said the company could issue equity shares, convertible debentures, foreign currency convertible bonds (FCCBs) or go in for QIP to raise up to $2 billion. Its all about the timing.         
	A number of QIPs are slated and companies have been waiting for the right opportunity since October. The opportunity has now come, perhaps a little sooner than anticipated, said Manish Sonthalia, a fund manager with Mumbai-based securities firm Motilal Oswal.        
	The QIP route is attractive for listed companies as these placements are based on the market price.         
	More companies will go in for QIPs especially those in a hurry to raise funds, said Prime Database chairman and managing director Prithvi Haldea.        
	Even distressed stocks such as Unitech and DLF have met with reasonable success in the issues they floated recently, he said.        
	Last month, Unitech raised $325 million from a share sale while DLF  the biggest listed real estate company  closed a $783-million issue last week.        
	Haldea also expects the tide to finally turn in favour of IPOs.        
	Several firms are dusting off their IPO prospectuses as there is an opportunity to float primary issues. However, there is a time lag between the secondary and primary markets and I dont see the IPO markets reviving before July, he added.

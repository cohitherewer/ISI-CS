The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | UB, Heineken bury the hatchet
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      UB, Heineken bury the hatchet
          OUR BUREAU AND AGENCIES                                            
	Mumbai, Dec. 7: Vijay Mallyas United Breweries and Heineken NV have finally managed to sink differences over their Indian operations, which cropped up when the Dutch company became a significant shareholder in UBL nearly two years ago.        
	Under a new agreement between the two signed today, UBL will brew and distribute Heineken beers in India.         
	Heineken, which holds 37.5 per cent in UBL, will now have its nominees on the board of the Mallya company.        
	Heineken will also buy APB India from Asia Pacific Breweries Ltd (APB), its own Singapore-based joint venture with Fraser and Neave, and transfer it to UBL.        
	The worlds No. 3 brewer will acquire the Indian investments of APB for 25 million euros, which is expected to be completed in the first quarter of 2010.        
	We are delighted to announce the partnership with Heineken. Based on the legal advices, we will be making and marketing Heineken in India, UB Group chairman Vijay Mallya said.        
	Along with Danish brewer Carlsberg, Heineken, in January 2008, had bought the UK-based Scottish amp; Newcastle (S amp;N), which held little over 37 per cent in UBL, leading to Heineken inheriting the entire shareholding of S amp;N in UBL.        
	Todays agreement is seen as a victory for Mallya, who had all along opposed the presence of Heineken representatives on his companys board, citing a conflict of interest.         
	The bone of contention was APB whose brands such as Tiger, Cannon 10000 and Barons Strong Brew were competing directly with UBL beers.        
	Under todays agreement, Cannon 10000 and Barrons Strong Brew will come under the UBL fold.         
	Speaking to the media from London, Mallya said there was a possibility of the Tiger brand getting transferred to UBL, and a committee had been formed to deal with the issue.         
	Mallya further disclosed that the Kingfisher beer would be brewed and distributed by Heineken in the global markets. While Kingfisher is present in countries such as the US, the UK, and New Zealand, UBL is looking at more countries in Africa and Europe.        
	Mallya said the distribution of the Heineken brand by his company would not eat into Kingfishers sales as the two brands catered to different segments. Heineken will be positioned as an international premium brand. Mallya said UBLs intention was to bring Heineken as soon as possible, though he did not give a specific timeline.        
	The Indian beer market, which has been experiencing a double-digit volume growth, is expected to expand to 14.4 million hectolitres in 2009, Heineken said.         
	Per capita consumption is about 1.3 litres per year compared with more than 50 litres in the developed world.        
	Jean-Franois van Boxmeer, chairman of Heinekens executive board and CEO, said, In the world of beer, there is no bigger or more exciting growth opportunity than India. We have long regarded a strong Indian presence as important in order to increase our exposure to and growth from developing markets.        
	According to the new shareholders agreement, Heineken has the right to nominate three members on the UBL board, including that of the chief financial officer.        
	Following a UBL board meeting earlier today, three Heineken men were inducted on the UBL board. Guido de Boer was appointed the chief financial officer. Ren Hooft Graafland (member of Heineken NVs executive board and chief financial officer) and Siep Hiemstra (regional president, Heineken Asia Pacific) were appointed as non-executive directors.        
	RobertJan Vos, an analyst at Fortis Bank Netherlands, said the deal would be good for Heineken in the longer term. It looks like it is quite a complex deal, but it seems Heinekens relationship with UBL will improve materially for the Indian market, he said.        
	UB gains        
	Shares of UBL today rose nearly 5 per cent on the BSE, bouyed by the Heineken development.         
	UBL stocks closed the day at Rs 191.50, higher by 4.73 per cent from its previous close on the Bombay Stock Exchange.        
	During the trading hour, the scrip shuttled between Rs 187.10 and Rs 169.95 before ending at Rs 191.50.        
	On the volume front, over 6.83 lakh shares changed hands. On the Amsterdam bourse, Heineken was last trading 1.17 per cent lower at 33.85 euros, after rising about 7 per cent on Thursday and Friday.

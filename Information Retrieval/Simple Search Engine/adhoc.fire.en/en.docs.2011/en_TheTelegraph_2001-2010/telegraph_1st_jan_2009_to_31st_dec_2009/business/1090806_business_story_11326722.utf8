	Calcutta, Aug. 5: NHPCs profits from its 13 power plants may increase by more than Rs 100 crore in the current financial year following the Central Electricity Regulatory Commissions new tariff regulation announced in January this year.         
	The tariff regulations for the period between April 2009 and March 2014 have increased the base rate of return on equity to 15.5 per cent from 14 per cent earlier, besides providing an additional return of 0.5 per cent for power projects that are commissioned within the given timelines.

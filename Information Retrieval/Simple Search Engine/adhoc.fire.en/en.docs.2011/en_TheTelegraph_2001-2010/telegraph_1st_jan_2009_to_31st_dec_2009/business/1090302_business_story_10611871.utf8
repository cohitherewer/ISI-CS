	New Delhi, March 1: Toyota Kirloskar Motors is likely to introduce its sports utility vehicle, the Fortuner, in the second half of the next fiscal. This will be the Japanese firms second SUV in India after the Prado.        
	According to sources, the diesel version of the Fortuner  priced in the range of Rs 16-18 lakh  will be launched between August and October.         
	We are looking at a time frame of August to October for its launch here. At the moment it will be only a diesel variant, and will come in a completely knocked down format. The price tag should not exceed Rs 18 lakh, a Toyota dealer said.        
	Toyota refused to give additional details on the launch date. Plans have not been finalised on when exactly it will be launched. But it sure is one of the strongest contenders for this year, Sandip Singh, deputy managing director (marketing), told The Telegraph.         
	The car has been built on an innovative multi-purpose vehicle platform similar to the Toyota Innova and will be assembled at the companys Bidadi factory in Bangalore. It will be available in a 2.5 or 2.7 litre diesel variant and will sport a DOHC turbo diesel engine.        
	According to sources, the new Fortuner will be an upgraded version of the one recently launched in Malaysia. In India, it is likely to come with auto transmission.        
	In Malaysia, the Fortuner is sold in two variants  2.7V and 2.5G. The 2.7V has a 4-cylinder VVT-i petrol engine and is available only in 4-speed automatic transmission.        
	The 2.5G has a DOHC turbo diesel engine. The Fortuner will compete with the Honda CRV, Mitsubishi Outlander and Ford Endeavour.         
	Toyota, like Honda Siel, Hyundai and Tata Motors, had put the brakes on manufacturing in the November-January quarter. The company manufactures 100-120 units a day against 180-210 units until October last year. Owing to the slowdown in the automobile industry, Toyota had cut 30 per cent output in November and December.

	Calcutta, Jan. 18: Engineering firm ABB Ltd will invest $100 million (Rs 490 crore) in the next 18 months to augment production and boost research and development capacities.        
	 We have just completed capital expenditure of $100 million and are going to invest another $100 million before the second quarter of 2010 to set up seven to eight production units, said Biplab Majumder, country manager and managing director, ABB Ltd.        
	Last week, the company set up an office in Salt Lake that houses a global R amp;D centre for its Swiss parent Asea Brown Bovery at an investment of Rs 10 crore. We have got the process automation order for one integrated steel plant of Corus and the entire project is being done from here, said Amitabha Sanyal, assistant vice-president (global application sales  primary metals), ABB Ltd.        
	ABBs cumulative order book for the January-September period last year was 20 per cent higher at Rs 6,793.10 crore compared with the same period in 2007. On a quarter-on-quarter basis, growth in booked orders was 13 per cent at the end of September 30, 2008.         
	Our current order book position is sufficient to see us through another two to three quarters, Majumder said.        
	According to him, the company is planning to increase its headcount in Calcutta to 500 this year. In the eastern region we work closely with Jadavpur University and here we have 150 engineers and 200 diploma engineers, he said. We usually do not go for IITs because students of those institutions generally have a very high level of aspirations, he said.        
	In the last two years, ABB has recruited more than 2,000 engineers in the country. We have grown from a Rs 800-crore company in 2001 to over Rs 6,000 crore in 2007, Majumder said.         
	Report card        
	For the nine months ended September 30, 2008, the company reported a growth rate of 15 per cent in revenue at Rs 4,750.40 crore and a 14 per cent increase in profit after tax at Rs 354.30 crore.        
	However, the net profit for the quarter ended September 30, 2008 was down 9 per cent at Rs 104.8 crore compared with the same period a year ago.

          GARIMA SINGH NEOGY                          Weighing options                                  
	New Delhi, May 17: Chinas Haier, the worlds No. 4 white goods manufacturer, is planning to acquire durables brands in India.         
	We are looking at brand acquisitions in our domain. Recession has made no impact. We are very much on track and have not shelved any acquisition plans. We are still in discussion, Pranay Dhabhai, whole-time director and chief operating officer, Haier Appliances (India) told The Telegraph.        
	According to sources, the company is ready to shell out anywhere between Rs 150 crore and Rs 200 crore for buyouts.         
	Refusing to divulge details, Dhabhai said Haier was very close to an acquisition last year.         
	In 2007, Haier Appliances India, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Haier group, acquired the appliance business of Anchor Daewoo, which included a refrigerator manufacturing unit near Pune.         
	At present, Haier has a two per cent share of the Rs 25,000cr durables market, dominated by Korean players such as LG and Samsung.        
	Any acquisition is a strategy aimed at growth and we are doing just that, Dhabhai said, adding that Haier plans to launch models across product categories ahead of the festive season.        
	Last year, Haier had clocked a turnover of Rs 350 crore, up from Rs 325 crore in 2007.         
	It is targeting a turnover of Rs 450 crore this year.        
	Earlier this year, Haier launched a range of refrigerators, which were imported from its plant in Italy.         
	The company also launched air-conditioners in February and a range of LCD television sets last month.        
	We will enter the water heater segment by August this year. Models will be launched across our existing range, Dhabhai said.        
	In India, Haier manufactures through its facility in Pune and through third-party contracts.         
	The contractors make washing machines and colour television sets in Dehradun and Noida, and air-conditioners at Hardwar.         
	The company imports LCD and plasma TVs and high-end spilt ACs as well as refrigerators from its overseas facilities.

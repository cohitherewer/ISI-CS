The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Pranab pledges more steps
                                                                                                               Pranab pledges more steps
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                    
	New Delhi, Feb. 19: Stand-in finance minister Pranab Mukherjee today said the Congress-led government could announce another stimulus package.         
	All measures necessary to boost the economy will be taken. The support the economy requires will be given. When I reply to the debate (on the interim budget next week), I may be in a position to give some detailed information, Mukherjee said while replying to supplementaries in the Rajya Sabha.         
	Top finance ministry officials said fresh measures could include some schemes of the Planning Commission, interest subsidies to specific sectors and a cut in interest rates. An urban employment guarantee scheme is also in the pipeline.        
	According to the officials, Mukherjee will soon hold talks with the RBI brass on rates. Yesterday, RBI governor D. Subbarao said in Tokyo that there was room for more rate cuts in the backdrop of falling inflation. Inflation dipped to a 13-month low of 3.92 per cent in the first week of February.        
	Mukherjee said fiscal correction and monetary changes should take place simultaneously.         
	However, much depends on how the central bank manages the huge borrowing programme of the government. It would not like to cut rates and then suck money out of the system by selling government bonds.         
	The minister said he could not announce many radical measures in the interim budget presented earlier this week. I had constitutional constraints. So I could not announce too many measures involving too much resources as the mandate of the government was coming to an end.        
	The government had earlier announced two stimulus packages to boost growth, which is expected to moderate to 7.1 per cent this fiscal from 9 per cent.         
	India is yet to feel the full impact of the global financial crisis that has pushed the US, Japan, Singapore and Europe into a recession.         
	Mukherjee said the situation was very complicated and there was no room for complacency.         
	He ruled out the possibility of free trade pacts, which India will sign with some countries, damaging the interests of industry.

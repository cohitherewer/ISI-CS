                                                                                                                           6                                                                                        Q amp;A      Housing rules
                                I bought a flat in a housing complex. The housing association has drawn a rule charging 50 per cent more for maintenance from owners who let out their flats. Is this legal for a non-government society?           Anil Bhadra, Calcutta
                    There are non-occupancy clauses in many co-operative housing societies. However, the maximum service fee a co-operative housing society can charge varies from state to state. For example, the non-occupancy charge cannot be more than 10 per cent in Maharashtra. So, you will have to check the bylaws of your housing society. But it is unlikely that the maximum non-occupancy charge will be 50 per cent. You can take some legal opinion before approaching the housing society with your complaints.                                  All in the family      We have an income tax file in the name of a Hindu Undivided Family. I want to buy a life insurance policy for my grandson and pay the premium on the policy out of the HUF income. Will this payment of premium be allowed for deduction under Section 80C?        K. V. Rao, Asansol
                    case of an HUF, a life insurance policy can be taken for any member of the joint family and the premium paid from the HUF fund can be claimed for deduction under Section 80C.                                     Senior concern      I shall be 65-years-old on January 15, 2010. When and which  Form 15G or 15H  should I need to submit to my bank to claim non-deduction of tax at source on interest income? My annual income is below the basic exemption limit. Should I submit the income tax return?        Sugata Mukherjee, Konnagar
                    According to the Income Tax Act, you can claim tax benefits entitled to a senior citizen in the financial year 2009-10. From the current financial year onwards, you can submit Form 15H. It is not mandatory to file income tax return if your annual income is less than the basic exemption limit.

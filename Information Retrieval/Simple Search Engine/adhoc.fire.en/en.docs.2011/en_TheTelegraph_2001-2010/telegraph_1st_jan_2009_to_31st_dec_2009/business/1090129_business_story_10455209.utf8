	Mumbai, Jan. 28: Tata Steel  the countrys largest steel maker since the Corus acquisition in early 2007  today reported a 56 per cent drop in net profit at Rs 466.24 crore, making it one of the worst quarters in recent memory.        
	The third-quarter performance was marred by a sharp slowdown in demand. The steel giant reported standalone figures and the consolidated results, including those for Corus, would be announced towards the end of next month.        
	In the year-ago period, Tata Steel had reported a net profit of Rs 1,068.58 crore.        
	The slowdown, which impacted demand from consumers such as the auto industry, crimped net sales which dipped to Rs 4,735.68 crore from Rs 4,928.23 crore in the same period last year.         
	The company also reported a Rs 126.80-crore notional foreign exchange loss which was attributed to convertible alternate reference securities issued last year.        
	While acknowledging that market conditions were tough, managing director B. Muthuraman said steel prices had plunged 60 per cent from the levels four months ago.        
	Although product prices have fallen, the prices of raw materials havent dipped as sharply. In the case of coal, where the company has entered into long-term contracts, prices are higher than the spot rates. Tata Steel imports around 40 per cent of its coal requirements.        
	According to Muthuraman, Tata Steel has taken various measures to cut costs. Apart from bringing down administrative overheads and other costs, the company has been trying to pare the cost for every tonne of steel produced. For instance, it is now running a new blast furnace in its Jamshedpur facility where production has been ramped up to nearly 9000 tonnes a day.         
	Tata Steel, he said, had seen a benefit of more than Rs 145 crore because of its performance improvement measures.        
	Crude steel production was 18 per cent higher than that in the same period last year but saleable steel production was flat.         
	Tata Steel hopes to sell around 1.5 million tonnes of steel in the fourth quarter. Prices are expected to hold around the current levels.

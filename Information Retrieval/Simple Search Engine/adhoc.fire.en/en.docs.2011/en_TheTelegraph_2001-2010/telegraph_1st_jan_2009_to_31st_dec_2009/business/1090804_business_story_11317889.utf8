	Mumbai, Aug. 3: Sun Pharmaceutical has settled a patent dispute with AstraZenecas MedImmune for a cancer drug.         
	The settlement will help Sun Pharma to market the generic version of MedImmunes Ethyol, which is used against head and neck cancer.         
	Sun Pharma has signed a settlement agreement with MedImmune, which stipulates the dismissal of the lawsuits filed in a US court against the submission of an abbreviated new drug application for the generic Ethyol.         
	MedImmune will grant Sun Pharma a licence to certain patents, which will permit it to continue marketing the drug in the US.         
	The Sun Pharma scrip closed at Rs 1,176.65 on the BSE, up 0.40 per cent from the previous close of Rs 1,171.95.

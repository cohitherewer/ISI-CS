	New Delhi, Oct. 29: Punjab National Bank, the countrys second largest public sector lender, plans to acquire a controlling stake in a joint venture with Kazakhstan-based Dana Bank.        
	The board has approved acquiring a 63.6 per cent stake in a joint venture floated in association with Kazakhstan-based Dana Bank. The bank will be moving ahead with the necessary regulatory approvals for operationalisation of the venture, K.R. Kamath, the newly appointed chairman and managing director of PNB, said while announcing the second-quarter results.        
	The New Delhi-based bank will also sell a 26 per cent stake in subsidiary PNB Housing Finance Limited and merge PNB Gilts with itself by December.        
	PNBs net profit for the second quarter ended September 2009 soared 31.1 per cent to Rs 927 crore on the back of a higher treasury income and falling cost of deposits. The bank had a net profit of Rs 707 crore in the September quarter last fiscal.

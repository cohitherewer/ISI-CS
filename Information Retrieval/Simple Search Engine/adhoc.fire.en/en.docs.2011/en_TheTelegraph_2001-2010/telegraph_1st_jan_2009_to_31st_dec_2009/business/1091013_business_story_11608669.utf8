          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Tepid response                                  
	New Delhi, Oct. 12: Global recession saw energy exploration firms bidding for just over half of the oil, gas and coal bed methane blocks put up for auction by the government.         
	Companies bid for 36 of the 70 blocks on offer under the eighth round of the New Exploration Licensing Policy (Nelp). State-run ONGC and its partners bid the most for 25 blocks. Eight of the 10 coal bed methane (CBM) blocks attracted 26 bids  the most coming from Essar Oil at six. ONGC in partnership with Jindal Petroleum and Nevyeli Lignite bid for three.        
	Mukesh Ambani-run Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL), which had won 45 blocks in the previous auctions, did not bid for any oil and gas block and made a symbolic offer for one CBM block.        
	First, it is the meltdown. Second, it is the abuse of the production-sharing contract, V.K. Sibal, the director-general of hydrocarbons, told reporters. The (gas) utilisation policy and the pricing are well clarified in our production-sharing contract but these have been regrettably openly challenged, Sibal said alluding to the move by the Anil Ambani group to challenge the governments right to decide the utilisation and pricing of gas.        
	In their reaction to the bidding, a spokesperson for the Anil Ambani group, which is locked in a battle with Mukesh Ambanis RIL, said, The petroleum ministrys open interference by curtailing marketing and pricing freedom is the single biggest reason for lack of international investor interest.        
	Only four foreign firms, including BHP Billiton of Australia, BG Group and Cairn India, bid for offshore blocks. Big names such as Exxon Mobil and Royal Dutch Shell were missing from action.         
	ONGC bagged over a third of the blocks in muted bidding. Of the eight deep water blocks that received bids, ONGC and its partners won six, all in the Andaman sea. The PSU is a minority partner in a KG basin block that went to BG Group. Cairn won the other deepwater block        
	Of the 13 shallow water blocks that received bids, BHP Billiton won three blocks off the west coast, while Cairn won a KG basin block. ONGC and partners won six shallow water blocks. ONGC was also a minority partner with Oil India which made a winning bid for the Cauvery basin shallow water block.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Probe homes in on Rajus Mauritius link 
                                                                                                               Probe homes in on Rajus Mauritius link 
          JAYANTA ROY CHOWDHURY                          RAISE A STORM                                  
	New Delhi, Jan. 14: Sleuths from the Serious Fraud and Investigation Office (SFIO), who have been poring over Satyams books in the past few weeks, are veering to the view that B. Ramalinga Raju may have stashed some of the cash in the tax haven of Mauritius.        
	So strong is this belief that the Enforcement Directorate has launched an independent probe into the foreign firms that invested in Satyam over the past few years. The agency is also investigating how much foreign currency-denominated funds Satyam raised and how these were deployed. This probe will be independent of the SFIO investigation though they will share information.        
	Former revenue secretary E.A.S. Sarma has also written a letter to Prime Minister Manmohan Singh on the Satyam fraud alleging that Mauritius-based funds should be scrutinised as possible recipients of funds siphoned out of the country. At the same time Satyam and Maytas and their promoters tax records would be scrutinised, top finance ministry officials said.        
	The investigation into the cash trail has thrown up the names of several Mauritius funds that arent very well known. They are suspected to have received the money and re-invested it in several group projects.        
	Mauritius funds have been under the scanner earlier too. A few years ago, a joint parliamentary committee had demanded that the tax treaty with Mauritius  which was used by several unknown funds to play the stock markets during a bull run  should be amended to plug loopholes in the provisions that allowed these funds to skim profits and pay virtually no tax. The JPC had wanted the government to lift the veil on these funds and their transactions.        
	Sleuths say it is difficult to put a ballpark figure on how much money was siphoned out of Satyam. It will be even more difficult to determine how much of it was invested in land or in associate companies.         
	Raju is also believed to have earned about Rs 2,500 crore through the sale of shares in Satyam over the past eight years, when his holdings came down from 25.6 per cent in March 2001 to 8.74 per cent now held by the family.         
	Out of this, Raju made about Rs 1,080 crore in just five years. Many believe a large chunk of this money was taken out of the country and brought back as investments in various group companies and projects.        
	Ultimately one of the ways to recover money would be by merging group entities with Satyam, top officials said.

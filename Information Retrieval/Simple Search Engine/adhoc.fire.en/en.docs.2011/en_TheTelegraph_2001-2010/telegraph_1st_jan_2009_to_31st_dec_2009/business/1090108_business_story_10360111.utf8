The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Client anger spells cash for rivals
                                                                                                               Client anger spells cash for rivals
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                            
	Mumbai, Jan. 7: Satyam Computer Services had 185 Fortune 500 companies on its client list  and the growing buzz is that many of them would be looking to find a new partner who isnt tainted by scandal.        
	Satyams new chief executive Ram Mynampati said he hoped to put the scandal behind, but there were very few who believed that this could be possible now.        
	The biggest beneficiary is likely to be Infosys and a few other tier I infotech companies such as Tata Consultancy Services and Wipro.        
	We believe Infosys remains the most significant gainer followed by Tata Consultancy Services and Wipro, said JPMorgan in a report put out today after the scandal broke.        
	Others who could benefit from an exodus of Satyam clients include multinational corporations with large operations in India, such as IBM and Accenture.        
	Most customers were likely to shift work to Indian players that have higher expertise in offshore, the report said.        
	Reversal of fortune        
	Analysts were making quick calculations to determine what the gains for the other companies might be.         
	Raju reported revised revenues of Rs 2,100 crore for the second quarter ended September 30, which would translate into an annualised figure of Rs 8,400 crore, or $1.9 billion.        
	We believe that most of this work (around 70 to 80 per cent) could get shifted. This would imply $1.5 billion of offshore work available. Assuming 75 per cent of this goes to offshore players, we believe that either Infosys, TCS or Wipro can potentially gain $250-300 million of annual revenues in 2009-10, the JPMorgan report said.         
	The analysts said given the potentially lower profitability of this business, they would raise their estimates for the financial year 2010 by 3 to 4 per cent for all the top IT players.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Quiet Adani start shocks power pack
                                                                                                               Quiet Adani start shocks power pack
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                            
	Mumbai, Aug. 20: Adani Power today failed to notch up the big listing gains that investors in the power utility were expecting  and the sedate opening spooked several power companies that have drawn up plans for their maiden flotations.        
	The power producer owned by Gautam Adani had raised over Rs 3,020 crore through its initial public offering early this month priced at Rs 100 a share. The share opened quiet at Rs 105 today.         
	It rose to an intra-day high of Rs 107.90 before plunging to a low of Rs 98.50. The stock then swung between gains and losses before closing at Rs 100.50 on the BSE. On the NSE, the stock had hit a high of Rs 110 and closed at Rs 100.10.        
	The quiet start to the Adani Power issue  which brought back grim memories of Reliance Powers listing in February 2008  seemed to presage tough times for IPOs, especially those from power utilities.        
	Reliance Power was the biggest-ever IPO in the domestic capital markets and had raised over Rs 11,500 crore. The blockbuster issue, which was oversubscribed 73 times and had raised Rs 7.57 trillion in collections, was priced at Rs 450 a share. It closed at a loss on the first day at Rs 373.50 on the NSE. The company had to issue bonus shares to soothe investor angst.        
	Girish Solanki, analyst at Angel Broking, said the valuation of Adani Power at the issue price of Rs 100 a share was stretched. Solanki puts the stocks fair value at Rs 82; other brokerages were less charitable and estimated its value at anywhere between Rs 75 and Rs 90 apiece.        
	Newbies wary        
	Sources said companies such as the Ruias-controlled Essar Power, which was planning to raise around $500 million to finance four projects, might decide to wait a while or even look at alternative funding options.         
	Jaiprakash Hydro Power, which has also announced plans to raise funds through a follow-on offer, may also decide to wait till the skittish markets stabilise.         
	Essar Power, however, denied it had plans to float an IPO. We have already achieved financial closure for a project in Madhya Pradesh and are close to tying up our funding needs for the balance three, said an Essar group spokesperson.        
	Just as there is a demand for power, there will be a demand for power IPO issues and the failure or success of a particular issue will depend on individual issues like pricing, said Ernst amp; Youngs national director (infrastructure) Jayesh Desai.

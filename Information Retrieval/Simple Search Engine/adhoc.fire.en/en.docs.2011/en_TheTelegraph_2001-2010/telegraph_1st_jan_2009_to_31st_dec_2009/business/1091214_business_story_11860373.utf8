The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Mutuals rue poor selling incentives
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Mutuals rue poor selling incentives
          VIVEK NAIR                      U.K. Sinha, CMD of UTI AMC                          
	Mumbai, Dec. 13: Mutual funds are not upbeat about their prospects in 2010 because the incentive structure for selling financial products is now hugely skewed towards insurance especially after the regulators ban on entry load.        
	In an interview to The Telegraph, U. K. Sinha, chairman and managing director of UTI Asset Management Company, said India should have a system as in England where equal incentive was offered across various products.        
	During August to October, the industry saw net redemption or negative sales of Rs 5,000 crore. However, for the same period, insurance saw net positive sales of over Rs 15,000 crore, the chief of one of Indias largest fund houses said.        
	From August 1, the Securities and Exchange Board of India, the capital market regulator, had barred mutual funds from charging investors an initial expense of 2.25 per cent of the subscribed sum, known as the entry load, which was passed on to distributors.         
	This discouraged distributors from promoting funds to retail investors.        
	Sinha said though UTI Mutual Fund reported net sales of Rs 600 crore during the period, the numbers could have been better.         
	There was not enough satisfaction as the numbers could have been higher.        
	He said the outlook for the sector in the coming months was not good.        
	The existing system (of incentives) works against mutual funds and is in favour of insurance, he said.        
	Sinha feared that banks investments in mutual funds might come down once the economy moved into top gear.        
	However, he is optimistic about bringing T Rowe Price in as a strategic partner.         
	T Rowe will invest in India through UTI and help the fund house in research and international marketing.         
	T Rowe will also help to boost inflows to the offshore UTI India Fund.        
	Sinha, who took over the reins of UTI AMC in 2005, made it clear that he would not focus on amassing fund from investors; rather, the emphasis would be on quality.        
	I want UTI to be recognised as the most trusted brand domestically and internationally, he said.         
	The aim is not only to get more number of retail investors into its fold but also provide quality service to make the fund the first choice among investors.        
	The UTI AMC chief, who is now heading a working group formed to recommend ways of rationalising existing regulations on foreign portfolio investment, is cautious on current stock prices.         
	The stock markets are at reasonably high levels and at these points, one has to be cautious, he said.

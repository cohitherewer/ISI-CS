                                                                                                                 Q amp;A      Locker facility
                                I have a locker in SBIs Belgharia branch in the name of myself, my wife and my son. My wife expired sometime back. I requested the bank branch manager to delete the name of my wife and include my daughter-in-law in her place. The manager told me it could not be done and well have to open a new account and surrender the existing one. Is the branch manager right or should I approach the chief general manager of SBI Calcutta circle?          Amit Sarkar, Belgharia
                    The branch manager would have given you the right advice if he had all the documents required under the KYC norm for all the account holders of the existing account.                                  Passbook pang      On June 11 this year, I had deposited four MIS account passbooks and one savings bank account passbook with Mathurakati (Kharagpur) Post Office for transfer to Calcutta-700094 post office. The Calcutta post office has not got those passbooks till today. What should I do now to get back those passbooks?        Arun Kumar Das, Calcutta
                    You first check out with the Kharagpur post office whether they had sent those passbooks to the Calcutta office. Hope you have kept photocopies of those passbooks and received the stamped acknowledgement of receipt of the passbooks from the Kharagpur post office. You can contact director, postal services (SB region Calcutta), at (033)-22120144 or 22121080 or 22253929 and seek redress to your complaint.                                  Senior benefit      My date of birth is March 28, 1945. Shall I get the tax benefit for senior citizens in assessment year 2 010-11. If yes, what shall be the basic exemption limit?        Swapan Kumar Biswas, Calcutta
                    der the Income Tax Act, a senior citizen is a person who has attained the age of 65 years or more in the previous assessment year. You shall attain 65 years in March 2010. So you can claim the basic exemption limit of Rs 2,40,000 in assessment year 2010-11.

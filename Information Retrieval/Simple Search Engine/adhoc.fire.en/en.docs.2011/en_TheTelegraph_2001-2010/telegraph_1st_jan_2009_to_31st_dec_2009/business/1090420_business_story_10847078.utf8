	New Delhi, April 19: The Indian government worried by the growing clout of China at multilateral finance forums is keen on a greater say at the forthcoming meetings of the G20 finance ministers, IMF and World Bank.        
	A team led by Planning Commission deputy chairman Montek Singh Ahluwalia will be at the G20 meet in Washington later this week, which will draw up details of the $1.1-trillion global rescue plan along with the measures to rein in tax havens.        
	In terms of its voting rights in the various global financial institutions  the IMF, World Bank and Asian Development Bank  India will have to contribute around $20 billion to back up its demand for a more significant role in the global finance forums.        
	However, it is for a new government after the elections to take a call on the actual amount that can be shelled out from the countrys $250-billion foreign exchange reserves.        
	While political leaders are busy with their election campaigns, the government has entrusted Ahluwalia with the job of trying to wrest a leadership role in Washington.         
	Indias pro-active role is aimed at restricting Chinas growing clout in global financial circles.         
	Recently, China had blocked a soft loan package from the Asian Development Bank for a project in Arunachal Pradesh.         
	Chinas forex reserves are seven times more than Indias reserves, giving it an edge at the multilateral forums.        
	Moreover, with its commitment of $40 billion to the IMF at the recent London meet of the G20, it has emerged as a key player in the framing of the new economic order.         
	India will be contributing around $10-11 billion to the IMF corpus, in proportion to its voting rights.        
	Three years back, the IMF in an ad hoc measure had reduced the countrys voting rights to 1.91 per cent from 1.95 per cent, while raising the rights of China, Mexico, Turkey and South Korea.         
	Subsequent reforms ensured that Indias voting rights were raised to 2.34 per cent, which the government hopes to double when the IMF carries out more reforms.        
	However, to strengthen its position, India needs to be at the forefront of the global restructuring efforts.         
	The G20 has accepted the inclusion of emerging economies such as India and Brazil into its Financial Stability Board, which replaces the existing financial stability forum. India has also got an entry into the Basel Committee on banking norms.         
	Finance ministry officials said, Global financial diplomacy is now going to be the key arena for power struggle. Those who manage to get into groups which control the levers of financial power will dictate how the global financial system works later. India cannot afford to be a bystander.         
	The G20 has also announced a crackdown on tax havens.         
	Officials said India would work with other nations towards transparent money flows from tax havens such as the Cayman Islands, irrespective of the party that was elected to power. Both the Congress and the BJP have been trying to gain political mileage from the G20 decision.         
	Though tax havens such as Mauritius and Cyprus comprise nearly half of Indias FDI, it is necessary to bring more transparency in the cash inflows as some of the money may have been earned illegally, posing a threat to the nations security.        
	World Bank move        
	The World Bank has said it is considering a proposal to raise the borrowing limit of individual countries, an issue which was pressed by India at the G20 meeting in London, to increase the flow of funds to developing countries from the multilateral lending agency.        
	Discussions are underway (for raising single borrower limit) but a decision has not been made, a World Bank spokesperson said.         
	At present, a country can borrow up to $15.5 billion, according to the single borrower limit fixed by the bank.

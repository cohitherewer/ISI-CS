        Dhirendra Kumar has an unconventional take on managing savings and investments                              
	Many years ago I first read the book Small is Beautiful by economist E.F Schumacher. Its not a popular book in business circles. Schumachers concepts of getting by with the least possible and smallest possible set of resources seem outlandish to a certain audience. To most businessmen, enoughness seems to be an idea more suited to a hippie commune from the sixties than to the world as they see it functioning.         
	But I believe, for a non-professional investor, a derivation of Schumachers approach would work very well as an investment philosophy. This is something that I would call the Simple is Beautiful approach. It could also be called Do Less to Do More approach.        
	This approach is based on my belief, borne out of many years of interacting with investors, that far more people go wrong by trying to do more than by doing too little. In personal investments, the idea is not to do a lot, but to do only the minimum possible.        
	The Simple is Beautiful approach means sticking to some basic time-tested principles  invest in the minimum possible number of securities and take the least possible actions.         
	In the last couple of decades, the culture of investing has shifted towards a worship of complexity for its own sake. More and more people assume that any investment methodology that doesnt involve mysterious formulae and arcane ratios and elaborate charts couldnt possibly deliver the goods. The truth is the exact opposite. This complexity is just smoke and mirrors erected by a priesthood to create a need for their services.        
	How would such a simple approach work in practice? Heres one example which could serve as the recipe for the perfect financial plan.        
	You should keep all the money that you might need in the next five to seven years in a safe fixed-income investment. The reason is obvious  this is the money that must always be on call. Only safety matters, nothing else.         
	Longer term investments should be put in three to four conservatively run equity funds with a good track record.         
	Remember, money should be moved from equity to fixed income when you think you might need it in a couple of years.         
	Is this an example of the best possible plan? Well, that depends on your definition of best. I think this plan is the best one because its basic principles require no further understanding. Its optimised not for returns, but for the best combination of comprehension and returns. Its very important to do only those things that we understand ourselves.        
	In personal finance, there are few issues that are as full of obfuscation as insurance. However, keeping the Simple is Beautiful principle in mind, it isnt difficult to cut through this thicket.        
	Heres what you need to do. Make a liberal estimate of how much money your family will need if you should fail to wake up tomorrow morning and buy the cheapest term insurance you can find. Do diversify your insurance across LIC and two private insurers  one is no longer confident of whos going to be solvent tomorrow.         
	You should buy lots of term insurance but never even think of buying any other product from an insurance company. In their mixed savings plus insurance products like ULIPs, the huge commissions and expenses they charge will kill your real returns.        
	Another important component of our approach is to somehow avoid having to react to market fluctuations. This is a major advantage of the kind of approach to investment that Im describing.        
	If you have an investment plan that needs tailoring to suit the season, then its useless to begin with. Almost by definition, the only useful approach to investing is one that does not need to change in reaction, or worse, in anticipation of events. Our plan would be just as good at the lows of March 2009 as it was at the highs of January 2008. Or in fact at any other point of time in the past decades. The Simple is Beautiful approach is structured around your life, not that of some investment market. In this approach, you change your financial plan when something happens in your life, not in the stock market.        
	One characteristic of this approach is understanding things yourself rather than being dependent on some expert. Far more people get into trouble by putting money into things that they dont understand rather than by earning a little lower return. Does that mean that experts are not needed at all? Not really, except perhaps to tell you that you dont need an expert!         
	Seriously, this is the gold standard of investment principles. No one should ever dabble in an investment that they dont understand personally. Its better to let a good investment pass by rather than invest in anything that you dont understand. An experts role is not to tell you where to invest, its to show you how to decide for yourself.

                                                                                                               Penalty pangs for telecom
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                          ALLs NOT FINE                                  
	New Delhi, Sept. 18: The department of telecom (DoT) has slapped a penalty of Rs 135.60 crore on mobile operators Bharti Airtel, Reliance Communications and Tata Teleservices for not rolling out networks on time.         
	The DoT may also fine new players if they fail to fulfil their network obligations.        
	All the recent entrants  Datacom Solutions, Loop Telecom, S Tel, Unitech Wireless and Swan Telecom  have been asked to submit the details of their network rollout so far, including the number of base stations and the location of mobile switching centres.         
	If an operator fails to fulfil its obligation or pay the penalty, the DoT will cancel the licence.        
	Aircel also faces a penalty of Rs 28.85 crore and Himachal Futuristic Communications Ltd, Rs 7 crore.         
	The two PSUs  BSNL and MTNL  along with Vodafone Essar face no penalty.         
	Airtel will have to shell out Rs 31 crore as a fine; the Tatas and Reliance will have to pay Rs 41 crore and Rs 19.65 crore, respectively, for non-compliance of network rollout norms.         
	The total penalty was lowered from Rs 477 crore to Rs 135.60 crore after repeated representations by the operators.        
	The cases for imposition of liquidated damages were processed since 2005 and show-cause notices for the damages (amounting to Rs 477.15 crore) were issued in 96 cases to 10 operators, said officials.         
	Operators had said that they were unable to meet the rollout deadline because of delays in getting statutory clearances and spectrum. The DoT, then, arrived at a lower penalty.         
	Under the current norms, any company which gets government approval to launch mobile services must ensure that its services are available in at least 10 per cent of the districts in a given circle within the first year of obtaining a licence.        
	After three years, the coverage should be 50 per cent of the districts.        
	In metros, the companies have to cover 90 per cent of the service area within a year.

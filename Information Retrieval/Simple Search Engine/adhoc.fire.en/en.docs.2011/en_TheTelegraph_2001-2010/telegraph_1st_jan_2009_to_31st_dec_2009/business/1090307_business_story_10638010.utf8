The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | DPSC bidders seek level-playing field
                                                                                                               DPSC bidders seek level-playing field
          SAMBIT SAHA                          Point of INTEREST                                  
	Calcutta, March 6: The presence of the Jindals in DPSC Ltd seems to have cast a shadow on the sale of the company.         
	Descon Ltd, the largest shareholder of DPSC, has pledged its entire 32.31 per cent holding to JSW Energy, owned and managed by Sajjan Jindal.        
	Several bidders now want the pledged shares of DPSC to be freed from the Jindals before the power generator and distributor is sold off.        
	JSW Energy is one of the 16 bidders vying for the 57 per cent of DPSC put on the block by Andrew Yule, the Life Insurance Corporation and the United India Assurance.         
	While Andrew Yule holds a 15.2 per cent stake in DPSC, the LIC owns 30.61 per cent and United India Insurance 11.36 per cent.        
	Bidders feel JSW Energy will have an unfair edge over the others as it has already created a position in the company.        
	The other bidders include Anil Ambanis Reliance Infrastructure, Tata Power, CESC, Coal India and Patton.        
	Descon had pledged 13,67,818 shares of DPSC for Rs 12 crore in September 2007 to JSW Energy. The money was to be returned by October 2008, but Descon has obtained an extension for a year.        
	Descon has so far returned Rs 6 crore to JSW Energy from the money it received by selling its own shares to overseas venture capital funds for Rs 23 crore.         
	However, the entire holding of Descon in DPSC continues to be pledged with JSW Energy according to the agreement between the two. Only after a full payment, can Descon get back the shares.        
	When Andrew Yule learnt about Descons share pledging, it obtained an ex parte order from Calcutta High Court restraining Descon from selling the pledged shares.        
	In a separate development, Descon is fighting a case in the Company Law Board against Yule over the divestment in DPSC. It has demanded the right of first refusal on the shares being sold by Yule and the institutions.        
	If Yule manages to overcome the legal challenge and goes through with the sale, Descon may move court to lift the ban on the pledged shares. It will then be free to sell its holding to anyone, including JSW Energy.        
	Bidders feel if JSW can corner a 32.31 per cent share cheap from Descon, it can bid far more aggressively in the selloff process.         
	They can always average out the cost of acquisition. We want Yule to free the shares before the sale process, a bidder said. However, it will be difficult for Yule to cough up the money and get the shares. I dont think that will be possible, an Yule executive said.        
	Sanjay Budhia, whose Patton is a bidder, said there was too much confusion on the sale. I will write a letter to Yule tomorrow seeking a clarification, he said.        
	Meanwhile, Andrew Yule has decided to defer calling bids on March 10 after it received the certified copy of the high court order.

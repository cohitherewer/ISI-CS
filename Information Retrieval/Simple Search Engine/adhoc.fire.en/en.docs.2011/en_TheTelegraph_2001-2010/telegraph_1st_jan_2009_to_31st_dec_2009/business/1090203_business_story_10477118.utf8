	Of the other concerns, Good Earth Corporation operated from Santa Cruz, California, while Tetley was based at Shelton in Connecticut. The company has closed the Tetley and Good Earth establishments.        
	Cost is the key in the US now. We have decided to go through a process by which in 2-3 stages we will eliminate large chunks of operational and managerial costs by having a unified command, Tata Tea managing director Percy T. Siganporia said. Barbara Roth will head the business in the US.        
	In addition, the company is planning to consolidate its manufacturing operations. It will outsource all manufacturing to its joint venture partner Harris Tea.        
	The company is in the process of forming a special team of top executives who will prepare strategies from London.

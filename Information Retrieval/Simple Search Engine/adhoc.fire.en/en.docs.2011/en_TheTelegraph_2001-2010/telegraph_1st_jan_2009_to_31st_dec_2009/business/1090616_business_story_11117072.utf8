The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | 3G issues head for solution
                                                                                                               3G issues head for solution
          JAYATI GHOSE                              
	New Delhi, June 15: The telecom ministry is hopeful of auctioning third generation (3G) licence and spectrum by September, as the availability of radiowaves and base price issues are set to be resolved soon.        
	With the defence authorities releasing 10 megahertz of spectrum over the next two to three months and the auction reserve price being increased to meet the finance ministrys demands, we expect to start 3G auction latest by September, a senior department of telecom (DoT) official told The Telegraph.        
	The DoT, in its note on 3G auction to be placed before the cabinet this week, has stated that the reserve price for auction of pan-India spectrum can be hiked to Rs 3,540 crore from Rs 2,020 crore. Telecom minister A. Raja will meet finance minister Pranab Mukherjee tomorrow to seek a consensus on the price.        
	The hike is aimed at addressing the concerns of the finance ministry, which fears that a lower base price will result in the government failing to meet its target of raising about Rs 40,000 crore.         
	Auctioning scarce radiowaves or spectrum, at a higher price will also enable the government to plug the widening fiscal deficit.         
	The finance ministry had demanded that the base price be set at Rs 4,020 crore.

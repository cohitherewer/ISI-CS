	New Delhi, Oct. 9: The new direct tax regime would be introduced in 2011 only after the government had thoroughly examined proposals on minimum alternate taxes and personal tax rates.        
	We want to present the stakeholders with a tax regime which is simple and broad based leading to lowering of tax rates, better compliance and reduced litigation, finance minister Pranab Mukherjee said at an interactive session with the representatives of industry.        
	Indicating that the government would not rush to come out with the new tax regime, Mukherjee said, We will try to expedite the process but at the same time we will give adequate time to examine each valid suggestion from stake holders because we do not want to commit any mistake in our anxiety to get it done. Therefore, every care will be taken and every aspect will be analysed very carefully  When it is ready, I will bring it.        
	Chambers of commerce and professional bodies such as the chartered accountants institute have pointed out several gaps and have also protested certain changes while appreciating the overall thrust of the code.         
	The other proposals, which would be scrutinised by the ministry, deal with capital gains tax on NRIs, double taxation avoidance agreements, taxation of foreign firms and charitable organisations, the minister said.         
	The code has proposed to bring all savings schemes under an EET (exempt, exempt, tax) system, which will require people to pay tax at the time of withdrawal of money.         
	At present, most savings schemes such as the PPF are of EEE (exempt, exempt, exempt) type  wherein tax exemption is enjoyed at all stages of investment, accrual and withdrawal.        
	On the minimum alternate tax (MAT), the code proposed to impose a minimum levy on the gross assets of a company instead of gross profit. The proposal, however, did not find favour with industry.        
	Ficci president Harshpati Singhania said, The proposed MAT is highly disadvantageous to capital intensive industries, long gestation projects and industries which are less profitable or even loss-making.        
	The industry body asked the finance minister to either scrap MAT and, if it was not possible, to continue with the present provisions.        
	Industry chambers also raised concerns about the general anti avoidance agreement, which deals with taxation of foreign companies in India.         
	They sought clarification on the definition of a resident company in India for taxation purposes.        
	Mukherjee said the government would make sure that the expectations and aspirations of tax payers were met under the new system.

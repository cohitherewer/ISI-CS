          JAYATI GHOSE                          Twists and turns                                  
	New Delhi, March 16: Indian IT companies can look to clinch deals worth Rs 5,000 crore in the next two months as global firms turn to low-cost destinations to beat the recession.        
	Software biggies such as Tata Consultancy Services, Infosys, Wipro and HCL have lowered rates for new contracts by 15-20 per cent compared with last year, prompting MNC customers to flock to Indian shores. Companies such as BT, Bank of America, Citibank, Visa, Best Buy, Applied Materials and Nissan are keen to strike new deals or renegotiate existing contracts with Indian firms.        
	Over the last six months, the top five Indian software companies have renegotiated deals worth around Rs 7,500 crore.        
	HCL Technologies recently bagged a seven-year Rs 1,750-crore services outsourcing contract from New York-headquartered media firm Readers Digest Association. Japanese auto makers Toyota and Nissan will also outsource deals worth Rs 500-1,000 crore each to India.         
	TCS, the countrys largest software exporter, is likely to get a Rs 500-crore contract from Sony, the Japanese electronics giant struggling under huge losses.        
	Such deals show how global sourcing helps economies take advantage of talent and new opportunities which will help revive the current economic situation, said Som Mittal, president of the National Association of Software and Service Companies.        
	Banking and financial services firms are also looking to India. JP Morgan Chase, which had acquired Washington Mutual and Bear Stearns, plans to ramp up outsourcing to India to around Rs 2,000 crore. At present, JP Morgan gives IT and back office projects worth Rs 1,250-1,500 crore every year to Cognizant, TCS and Accenture, apart from its centre in Mumbai.        
	Nasscom estimates the domestic IT-BPO industry to garner revenues of around $71 billon in 2009.

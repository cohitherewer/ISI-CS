          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                      
	Mumbai, Oct. 5: Kumar Mangalam Birlas move to create a consolidated cement entity entered the second phase today when Samruddhi Cement, a wholly owned subsidiary of Grasim Industries, approached group firm UltraTech Cement for a merger.        
	The board of UltraTech will meet tomorrow to consider the proposal.        
	Last Saturday, Grasim had announced the decision to hive off its cement business to Samruddhi Cement.         
	The stock market, however, did not take the Grasim decision kindly. The Grasim scrip today opened at Rs 2,650 and dipped to Rs 2,492 before closing at Rs 2,509.10, a drop of 7.10 per cent, or Rs 191.70.        
	The Grasim consolidation will create an entity with a capacity of 49 million tonnes, making it the countrys single largest cement producer. Grasims present capacity is 26 million tonnes and that of UltraTech is 23 million tonnes.        
	According to sources, the UltraTech board will have to appoint valuers if it accepts Samruddhis proposal. They said the process of listing Samruddhi and the merger of the two firms would run simultaneously.         
	The entire process of the creation of a merged cement entity should take around eight months, they said.

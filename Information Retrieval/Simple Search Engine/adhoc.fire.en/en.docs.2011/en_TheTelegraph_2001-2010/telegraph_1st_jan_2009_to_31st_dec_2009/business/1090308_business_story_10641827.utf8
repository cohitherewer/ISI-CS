                                                                                                               Sterlite to shell out less for Asarco
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Mumbai, March 7: Sterlite Industries (India) Ltd has managed to hammer down the acquisition cost of copper producer Asarco LLC by over 34 per cent.        
	The Anil Agarwal-led Vedanta group has renegotiated a new deal under which it will pay $1.1 billion in cash and another $600 million through promissory notes.         
	The cash payment will be made as soon as the deal is closed, subject to court approvals. It wasnt immediately clear how long the approval process would take.         
	Sources said it could take up to four months to win all the approvals. The payout through promissory notes will be spread over nine years.        
	The new price is over 34 per cent lower than the $2.6 billion that the two sides had agreed upon in May 2008.        
	Sterlite today announced it had signed a definitive agreement with Asarco for the sale of all the operating assets of the Tuscon-based mining, smelting and refining company. It said it would issue senior secured non-interest bearing promissory notes for $600 million. A sum of $20 million will be paid every year from the end of the second year for seven years.         
	At the end of the ninth year, a terminal payment of $460 million will be paid.        
	Interestingly, the price paid during a particular year can also vary. If the average daily copper price in a particular year increases beyond $6,000 per tonne, the payment for that year will be proportionately increased subject to a maximum of $66.67 million and the terminal payment in the ninth year will be correspondingly reduced, keeping the total payment at $600 million.        
	Copper prices are now ruling at around $3,700 per tonne and the average price so far this year is around $3,500 per tonne.        
	Industry circles expect the metals average price to be close to this level during this calendar year.        
	The agreement is subject to the approval of the US Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of Texas, Corpus Christi division.        
	Asarco, formerly known as American Smelting and Refining Company, is a 110-year old company and is currently the third largest copper producer in the US.         
	Sterlite said the integrated assets to be acquired include three open-pit copper mines and associated mills and a copper smelter in Arizona and a copper refinery, rod and cake plants and a precious metals plant in Texas.        
	The asset acquisition is on a cash-free and debt-free basis. Sterlite will assume operating liabilities but not legacy liabilities for asbestos and environmental claims for ceased operations.         
	Reports say Asarco is now facing close to $8 billion in claims.   
	STEPS AHEAD    Sterlite to buy Asarco for  $1.1bn in cash on the  closing of the deal and  $600m through promissory  notes payable over a period  of nine years   Of the $600m, $20m will be  paid annually from the end of  second year for 7 years  Terminal payment of $460m  at the end of ninth year   If copper prices rise above  $6,000 per tonne on an  average every year, annual  payment will be increased,  proportionately, subject to a  maximum of $66.67m   Deal subject to approval of US  Bankruptcy Court for the  Southern District of Texas

                                                                                                                 Q amp;A      Pay arrears
                                I had retired from central government service on December 31, 2007. I have received the 40 per cent arrears of the revised pay under the Sixth Pay Commission recommendation. When shall we get the balance 60 per cent arrears?           SGD, Garia
                    The balance 60 per cent arrears of all central government employees with their salary/pension payment is expected in September 2009. The government has issued this order on August 25.                                  Filing returns       I am a retired person (date of birth 11.10.1945). My total annual income in 2009-10 will be Rs 2,16,730 (Rs 1,25,400 from pension, interest from bank fixed deposit of Rs 42,010 and interest of Rs 49,320 from Senior Citizen Savings Scheme). I have two life insurance policies with monthly premium outgo of Rs 3,000. Do I have to file income tax return? If yes, how can I do that?        Mridula Das, Calcutta
                    You shall be 65 years of age by October 2010. So you cannot get the senior citizen benefits under the income tax act for the 2009-10 financial year. In that case, the basic exemption limit on income for tax purposes will be Rs 1,90,000 for you. Since your gross annual income in 2009-10 will be above Rs 1.90 lakh, you shall have to file income tax return in 2010-11 assessment year. You can contact your local income tax department for filing the return.                                  For my daughter      How much money can I give in cash to my daughter as gift? Is my son-in-law a close relative under the income tax law? If not, how much money can I gift him without attracting any tax?        Basudeb Sarkar, Konnagar
                    You can give any amount of cash as gift to your daughter. There is no problem. However, taxmen may not like this. So, before gifting the money keep this transaction documented on a plain paper and witnessed by two non-relatives. Yes, the definition of specified persons covered in the income tax act on gift issues covers son-in-law.

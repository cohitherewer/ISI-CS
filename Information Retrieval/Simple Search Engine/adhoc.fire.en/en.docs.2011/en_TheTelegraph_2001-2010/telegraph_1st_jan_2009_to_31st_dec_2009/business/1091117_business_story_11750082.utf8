	Calcutta, Nov. 16: Copier and digital camera maker Canon today said it would buy Dutch copier and printer firm Oc for 730 million euros ($1.09 billion).        
	Oc CEO Rokus Van Iperen said the decision to sell was taken only after a strategic review. Recession did cast its shadow on the firm, but it was not the reason for the review.        
	Oc, which has suffered losses in the last two quarters, has been cutting costs and shedding jobs, and has not paid a final dividend in 2008. Japans Canon has also reported a sharp decline in quarterly profits last month.        
	According to Van Iperen, the deal value, which includes debt and other obligations, is estimated at 1.5 billion euros ($2.2 billion). Oc competes with Americas Xerox and Japans Konica Minolta.        
	Canon president and chief operating officer Tsuneji Uchida said, Through the merger of Canon and Oc, we believe that we will be able to realise clear benefits not only in the area of research and development but also in terms of product mix and marketing.

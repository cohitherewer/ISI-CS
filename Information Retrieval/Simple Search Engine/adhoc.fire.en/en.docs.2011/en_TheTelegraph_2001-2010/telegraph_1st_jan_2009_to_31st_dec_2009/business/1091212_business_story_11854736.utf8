	New Delhi, Dec. 11: The auction of third-generation (3G) spectrum is on schedule, but the government has not yet decided on the number of players in each circle.        
	The number of slots to be auctioned in each circle will be decided by the empowered group of ministers, telecom minister A. Raja said.         
	The empowered group of ministers (eGoM) on 3G, headed by finance minister Pranab Mukherjee, is likely to meet in the next two weeks.        
	Earlier, the government had announced that the auction would begin on January 14 with four slots of spectrum put up for auction, meaning there would be four players per circle.        
	However, uncertainty over the availability of radiowaves, or spectrum, because of the reluctance of defence forces to vacate them for civilian use could force the government to review the number of slots in a circle.         
	The defence ministry has expressed its inability to release 15 megahertz of 3G spectrum before the scheduled date.        
	Sources said the department of telecom was planning to sell less slots and come up with an alternative payment structure for those who did not get spectrum immediately.         
	These changes would require modifying the bid documents and, therefore, require permission from the law ministry, which would make it a tedious and lengthy procedure, they added.         
	Faced with a steep fiscal deficit, the Centre is keen on holding the auction process by this financial year.        
	DoT officials said the notice inviting applications was ready and would be provided to the prospective bidders as soon as the number of slots on auction is decided.

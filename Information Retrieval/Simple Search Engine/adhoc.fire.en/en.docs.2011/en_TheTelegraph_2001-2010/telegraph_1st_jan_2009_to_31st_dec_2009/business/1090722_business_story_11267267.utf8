	New Delhi, July 21: Planning Commission deputy chairman Montek Singh Ahluwalia today said there would be no more stimulus packages for the economy.        
	He said the budget had many incentives for the economy. We dont need any more stimulus packages. We should concentrate on implementing what is there, he told reporters.        
	The government had earlier cut excise duty by 6 per cent and service tax by 2 per cent in three stimulus packages.         
	He said it was too early to say that the monsoon would have an adverse impact on the gross domestic product.        
	Now it is too early to say about the condition of the monsoon; this is true that so far there is a problem but the impact of this could be ascertained only when we come to know the total deficiency in rainfall; if it is 5-10 per cent deficit then there would not be much impact, he said.        
	Export sops        
	The government today said it would provide sops to exporters in the foreign trade policy to be announced in August.         
	We will see what best we can do to make Indian exports competitive globally, commerce minister Anand Sharma told reporters.

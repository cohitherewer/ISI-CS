The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Pranab gives due recognition to infrastructure
                                                                                                               Pranab gives due recognition to infrastructure
          SUSHI SHYAMAL                          BRICK BY BRICK                                  
	In the backdrop of a global slowdown affecting demand, the finance minister has presented the budget as a first-step stimulus measure. The medium-term perspective of the budget was to achieve a GDP growth rate of 9 per cent.         
	To attain this, Pranab Mukherjee reinstated the importance of core sector development, increasing infrastructure investment to 9 per cent of GDP by 2014. He requested the departments concerned to clear the legal, regulatory and institutional bottlenecks for speedy implementation, while promising to make sufficient funds available.         
	The infrastructure sector, thus, receives a double boost  as a direct consequence of fiscal stimulus and as a catalyst sector to pave the way for economic growth.        
	The government, in the interim budget, had announced that 54 central infrastructure projects estimated at around Rs 67,700 crore have been approved. These projects require a huge capital outlay and adequate availability of funds. India Infrastructure Finance Company Limited (IIFCL) was entrusted with the task of providing long-term financial assistance to such huge projects. IIFCL has been asked to evolve a take-out financing scheme with commercial banks as one of the ways to fulfil its mandate. Under this scheme, around 60 per cent of the financing of commercial banks for PPP projects are proposed to be refinanced.         
	Infrastructure is a long-term investment. Availability of financing for such long periods through the take-out financing scheme will provide a boost to project viability. It will also ensure that banks have sufficient capital to fund new projects. However, one needs to watch out for the contours of the scheme.         
	Roads and highways        
	The outlay of funds to the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) has been increased 23 per cent to around Rs 16,000 crore from Rs 12, 966 crore in 2008-09. The minister of surface transport and highways has announced a target of building 7,000 km of roads every year. The slew of projects that have been recently awarded demonstrates the governments seriousness in putting the construction of roads on the fast track. The higher allocation may be used by the NHAI to enhance capacity through cash contracts or enhance viability through annuity or viability gap funding.         
	Railways        
	The allocation for railways had been increased to Rs 15,800 crore from Rs 10,800 crore in the interim budget. The railway budget emphasised on the development of land banks, the Delhi-Mumbai industrial corridor, logistics parks, rail coach factory and 50 world-class stations on public-private partnership. However, it would have been useful if the time frame for the completion of these projects had been specified.         
	Power        
	An increased allocation of around Rs 2,080 crore (over 160 per cent) to the Accelerated Power Development and Reforms Programme will promote efficiency in the transmission and distribution sector. Allocation under the Rajiv Gandhi Gramin Vidyutikaran Yojna has been increased 27 per cent to speed up rural electrification. For the power sector, the benefit of section 80 IA has been extended from retrospective effect to reconstruction and revival of old power plants.         
	Customs duty cut on wind energy equipment and bio-diesel is a welcome measure for the renewable energy sector. However, a lot more was expected. The decision to impose service tax on goods transported by rail and coastal cargo will increase the landed cost of coal, increasing the cost of production and tariffs.         
	Construction        
	The increased allocation for infrastructure augurs well for construction companies. If the various government programmes are implemented within the deadline by utilising the allocation, it will help swell the order books of many construction companies. Other sectors such as aviation and ports, however, were conspicuous by the lack of any incentive in the budget.

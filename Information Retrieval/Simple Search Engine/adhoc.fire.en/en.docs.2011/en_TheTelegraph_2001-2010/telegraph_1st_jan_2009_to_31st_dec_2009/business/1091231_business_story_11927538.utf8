          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                           Need of the hour                                  
	Mumbai, Dec. 30: Stock brokers today asked the Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) and the National Stock Exchange (NSE) to continue with the present market timings till adequate infrastructure was in place.         
	The Association of National Exchange Members of India (ANMI) today quoted a recent survey and said around 62 per cent of its members were against the move as extending the trading hours could put additional load on the system.         
	We are of the view that it is necessary to maintain status quo on the timing till adequate infrastructure is in place. There should not be any hurry to extend the market timing, ANMI secretary Ishaq Merchant told reporters.        
	Merchant said a weak infrastructure would not be in the interest of any party concerned and investors might suffer in the short run. He, however, pointed out that extended market hours were inevitable in the long run.        
	Last week, the committee of BSE Brokers Forum also reiterated its reservations on advancing the market opening time to 9 am.         
	According to the committee, neither market participants nor retail investors will benefit from the proposed move and that 79 per cent of the trading members of the BSE have in a survey opposed the proposal.         
	Apart from the increase in stress levels, a key worry of the broking community is the system of real time gross settlement (RTGS).         
	The RTGS system is a funds transfer mechanism where the transfer of money takes place from one bank to another on a real time basis.         
	This is the fastest money transfer system through the banking channel and is for large value transactions.         
	Brokers have been demanding that the RTGS timings should also be changed to reflect the change in trading hours.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Comcast buys stake in NBC Universal
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Comcast buys stake in NBC Universal
                            
	New York, Dec. 3 (Reuters): Comcast Corp struck a deal to buy a majority stake in NBC Universal from General Electric Co, creating a media superpower that would control not just how television shows and movies are made, but how they are delivered to homes.        
	The deal had been discussed for months and brought to light deep divisions over the future of the media business, with some lauding Comcast chief executive officer Brian Roberts as a visionary and others calling it the most foolhardy acquisition since AOL bought Time Warner in 2001.        
	In a world where the Internet has disrupted traditional media, Comcast wants NBC Universal so that it can deliver programming to audiences the way they want it  whether through television sets, personal computers or mobile devices.         
	Not only is Comcast the largest US cable distributor, it also is the leading Internet service provider to homes.        
	Critics of the deal, including some of Comcasts own shareholders, suggest there is too little overlap between the businesses to draw out meaningful savings, and that competition regulators are bound to burden it with restrictions.        
	Moreover, big media deals rarely work, they say, pointing to Time Warner Incs break-up as an example.         
	Once the worlds biggest media company Time Warner has spun off Time Warner Cable Inc and will soon do the same with AOL.

	Hyderabad, Jan. 19 (PTI): Maytas Infras chief executive officer P.K. Madhav has resigned because of his preoccupation with legal matters concerning Nagarjuna Finance.        
	Madhav has expressed his inability to continue as the CEO of the company in view of his attention and energy being used to address the legal matters pertaining to the Nagarjuna Finance case, Maytas Infra said in a statement. He is a director at Nagarjuna.        
	Madhav was with Maytas Infra since 2006.         
	Madhav and Nagarjuna group chairman K.S. Raju were arrested on December 16 and sent to judicial custody till December 29 on charges of defaulting on payments to depositors.         
	The duo have been released on conditional bail.

	Vedanta scraps deal        
	Vedanta Aluminium Ltd has terminated its contract with Maytas Infra for a project in Orissa, sources in the Anil Agarwal group firm said.        
	Maytas Infra was commissioned to build a township for Rs 233 crore at Jharsuguda following a contract in March 2008.        
	The contract was terminated as only 10 per cent of the work had been completed during the last 10 months for the township project, a source said.

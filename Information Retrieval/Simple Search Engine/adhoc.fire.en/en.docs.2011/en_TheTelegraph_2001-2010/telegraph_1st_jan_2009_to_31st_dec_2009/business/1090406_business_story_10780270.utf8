          GARIMA SINGH NEOGY                          MARCH ON                                  
	New Delhi, April 5: Hotel chains such as The Leela and the Accor are on track with their expansion plans even during the slowdown.        
	The Leela group plans to invest around Rs 2,500 crore in five new properties by 2012. France-headquartered Accor will set up around 45 hotels over the next three years, adding nearly 10,000 rooms to its existing 800 in India.        
	The Leela group will open a hotel each in Delhi and Chennai by 2010 and Hyderabad, Pune and Agra by 2012, adding 1,000 rooms to its inventory of 1,600.        
	We have five hotels and resorts in India. We are inaugurating our property in Udaipur this month. We are now planning to invest $500 million to open five more properties by 2012, said Mithu Basu, group head (corporate communications), The Leela.        
	This comes at a time when the industry is witnessing a drop in occupancy and revenues under the impact of the global recession.        
	The average occupancy ratio across the country is around 50 per cent, which has brought down the room rent by 25 per cent. The hotels may revise their printed rates in September-October, said M.P. Purushothaman, president of the Federation of Indian Hotels and Restaurants Association of India (FHRAI).        
	Undeterred by the gloom, Accor is planning to employ 10,000 people in India over the next three years. It has 1,300 people on its rolls at present.        
	The company will bring its global brands  Sofitel (premium), Pullman (premium), Novotel (business), Ibis (economy), Mercure (mid-segment) and Formule 1 (budget).        
	We are on our way to opening 50 hotels in India by 2012. Our focus is on building the size and spreading our network over the next few years, said Michael Issenberg, chairman (Asia Pacific) and chief operating officer of Accor.        
	Accor is present in around 100 countries. In India, it has 809 rooms across three hotels  two in Hyderabad and one in Gurgaon.        
	Analysts say very few hotels are ready to invest in expansion at this time of crisis.        
	According to estimates, nearly 600 new hotels were planned or were under various stages of development.        
	Of these, 150 new projects have been dropped, while 18,000 rooms across 150 other hotels are up for sale.

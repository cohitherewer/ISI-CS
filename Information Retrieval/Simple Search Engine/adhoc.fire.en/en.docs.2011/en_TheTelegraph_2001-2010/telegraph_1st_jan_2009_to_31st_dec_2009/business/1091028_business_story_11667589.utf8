	New Delhi, Oct. 27: A go-slow by workers at its Manesar facility in Haryana has resulted in Honda Motorcycle and Scooter Indias (HMSI) order backlog touching 1.4 lakh units.         
	The workers union at the facility has been on a strike since August. The company hopes to clear the backlog soon with the commencement of operations today at its third assembly line.         
	Early this morning, we started operating the new assembly line, which is the third one in our plant. To begin with, the third line would have a daily production of 300-400 units and we hope to take it to 1,000 units after some weeks, Shinji Aayoma, president and CEO of HMSI, said.         
	The company today launched the advanced version of its gearless scooter Aviator.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Dhir: Expansion mode                                  
	New Delhi, Aug. 26: Cairn India plans to invest $1.3 billion in the next two years to ramp up oil production to 1.75 lakh barrels per day from its fields in Rajasthan.        
	The British firms Indian arm has already invested $2 billion and will begin production from Saturday.         
	Cairn India chief executive Rahul Dhir said peak production from the three oil fields  Mangala, Bhagyam and Aishwariya  would amount to over 20 per cent of the countrys oil output and reduce the import bill by about 8 per cent.         
	India imported crude worth $75.7 billion in 2008-09 and $67.8 billion in 2007-08. This is a very important first step for us. But we see a resource here that will produce probably for the next 40-50 years and we are just starting with the journey, he said.        
	Dhir said the Mangala field would start producing a few thousand barrels of oil per day and gradually ramp output up to 30,000 bpd. This field will hit a peak output of 1,25,000 bpd in the first half of 2010. Along with Bhagyam and Aishwariya, production will top 1,75,000 bpd in 2011.        
	Initially, crude would be sold to Mangalore Refinery and Petrochemicals Limited (MRPL), a subsidiary of state-run ONGC. The oil will be sent by truck to Kandla in Gujarat for shipment to Mangalore. The government has nominated MRPL, Indian Oil Corporation Limited (IOC) and Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Limited (HPCL) to buy the crude.        
	Supplies to IOC will begin after the commissioning of a pipeline in December. The first barrel will go to MRPL and the first pipeline barrel will go to IOC, Dhir said.         
	Costs to the Edinburgh-based company will fall sharply when the pipeline is operational  compared with $10-12 per barrel in a truck, the cost through the pipeline is just $1.5.        
	Dhir said Cairn expected to raise the peak output of 175,000 bpd by 15 per cent through enhanced oil recovery techniques.         
	However, the cost to recover the extra crude would be much higher at $10-$12 per barrel against the normal cost of $5.        
	The price of crude would be 10-15 per cent less than the average Brent crude rate in the six months ended June 30. For the refiners, the first consignment would cost $45-$48 per barrel.        
	Cairn has allocated 0.20 million tonnes each to IOC and MRPL; HPCL will pick up 0.30 million tonnes.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Reliance rationale for hike in KG cost
                                                                                                               Reliance rationale for hike in KG cost
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Aug. 24: Capital expenditure to develop Reliance Industries gasfields in the Krishna-Godavari basin jumped manifold largely because of the discovery of more reserves and the higher cost in procuring equipment, the company said.        
	In a letter to oil secretary R.S. Pandey last Thursday, which was released today, Reliances president and CEO (petroleum) P.M.S. Prasad stated that the reserves increased 2.5 times leading to the company doubling its estimate of peak production from the fields.        
	Along with higher reserves, Reliance said, the estimated life of gas fields went up.        
	All this meant higher cost in developing the fields, in which a big contributory factor was the increase in rig hire fees, and installation and other service contract charges.        
	Reliance had increased the capital expenditure from $2.47 billion in 2003 to produce 40 million cubic metres per day (mcmd) to $8.83 billion in 2008 to produce more than double the amount.        
	The letter said oil prices between 2003 and 2006 increased over 100 per cent leading to the rise in rig hiring fees and other charges.        
	The letter was a rebuttal to the advertisement campaign launched by Anil Ambani-controlled Reliance Natural Resources Limited (RNRL), which questioned the capital expenditure and the consequent loss of revenue to the government.         
	On Friday, the oil ministry, too, refuted RNRLs charges.        
	Without naming RNRL, Prasad wrote: Certain parties are bent upon holding the national interest hostage to their own narrow commercial interests and are stopping at nothing to destroy the reputation of the country. It is necessary to nip these malafide endeavours in the bud for the sake of the energy security of the country.         
	Prasad, in the letter, said, Ultimately cost and profit share in a Production Sharing Contract (PSC) regime are not dependent on capex estimates but have well informed systems of checks and balances to monitor actual cost recovery This includes tendering procedures, approvals by the Management Committee or the Government, statutory audits, and audit by the Government under the PSC.

          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Oct. 9: Finance minister Pranab Mukherjee today asked industry to work to deepen and broaden the domestic market.        
	We have to deepen and broaden the domestic market so that we can ride the shocks and uncertainties of the global economy just as well as the periods of expansion and boom, said Mukherjee.        
	This requires that we take a balanced, broad-based approach to our development process, he said.        
	The finance minister said GDP has grown at 8.5 per cent in the past few years, although there was a significant dip in the rate in 2008-09 as a result of the global meltdown.

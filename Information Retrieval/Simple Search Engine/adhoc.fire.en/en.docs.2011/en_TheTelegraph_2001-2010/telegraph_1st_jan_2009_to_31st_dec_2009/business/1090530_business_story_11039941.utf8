The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Positive cues spur sensex surge 
                                                                                                               Positive cues spur sensex surge 
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT      
	Mumbai, May 29: The sensex has started rocketing once again, taking its cue from a stream of encouraging macro-economic numbers and upbeat comments from new ministers in key economic ministries.        
	The bellwether index gained 329 points to end at a nearly nine-month high of 14625.25. But that is not all: the benchmark index has gained a little more than 28 per cent in May, its best monthly performance in 17 years.            
	Brokers said the two crucial factors that prompted investors to scoop up stocks were the GDP numbers and petroleum minister Murli Deoras statement that oil prices would be deregulated soon, which seemed to lend credence to the view that the new government at the Centre would push economic reforms.  
	Reacting to the GDP growth of 5.8 per cent in the January-March quarter, Goldman Sachs said in a note that the economy continued to have significant pent-up demand for investment, particularly in infrastructure and in affordable housing.        
	We, therefore, see upside risks to our GDP growth forecast of 5.8 per cent for 2009-10, Pranjul Bhandari and Tushar Poddar said.        
	Foreign institutional investors (FIIs) have been shovelling money into stocks. According to provisional numbers on the National Stock Exchange, the FIIs bought shares worth Rs 1,860 crore.        
	A major highlight of the day was the rally in oil stocks. While Reliance Industries Ltd gained 2.6 per cent to end at Rs 2,277.50, ONGC rose 4 per cent to Rs 1,175.90.                                 
	Similarly, BPCL gained 3.8 per cent at Rs 464.95 and Indian Oil Corporation surged nearly 7 per cent to Rs 609.30.        
	The BSE Sensex, which opened at 14,319.87, shot to an intra-day high of 14,727.28, before profit taking towards the end of session restricted the gains and the index ended at 14,625.25, a rise of 329.24 points.        
	Gains were not seen in oil stocks alone. Apart from cement company ACC which gained 8.56 per cent, DLF rose 8.41 per cent, TCS 6.05 per cent,        
	Tata Steel 5.92 per cent, Mahindra amp; Mahindra 5.67 per cent and L amp;T by 4.75 per cent.        
	The strong stock markets had its impact on the forex markets with the rupee rallying against the US dollar. The Indian unit ended at Rs 47.11/12 per dollar, stronger than the last close of Rs 47.60 per dollar after hitting an intra-day high of 47.07. A rally in government security prices was also observed on the bond markets.

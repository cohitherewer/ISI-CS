The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Gold purchase plan on track
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Gold purchase plan on track
          JAYANTA ROY CHOWDHURY               OVERCOME DUBAI BLUES                                      
	New Delhi , Nov. 29: India may try to buy another 200 tonnes of gold from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) at a time the Dubai crisis has smudged the yellow metal.         
	The finance ministry will not interfere in the Reserve Bank of Indias decision-making process on the purchase.        
	Officials said the RBI might try to buy more gold if the price was right. The price could determine whether and how much India decides to trade in its dollar reserves for gold.         
	India has already traded part of its US currency reserves to buy 200 tonnes at market prices on November 3, spending $6.7 billion on the purchase.         
	With prices on the upswing, prior to the Dubai crisis, the value of the 200 tonnes has increased by nearly $800 million.         
	On Friday, however, gold in London for immediate delivery dropped as much as $50.28, or 4.2 per cent, to $1,138.10 an ounce, the biggest intra-day slide since January 12. Bullion futures for February delivery on the New York Mercantile Exchange slid 3 per cent to $1,153.20.        
	The crisis began on Wednesday when Dubai, part of the United Arab Emirates, asked to delay payment on $59 billion of debt issued by conglomerate Dubai World and its main property subsidiary Nakheel, sending global markets into turmoil and sparking fears of another financial meltdown. In India, the sensex on Friday fell 223 points in very volatile trading, with banking and real estate stocks taking a hit.        
	The officials said the Dubai crisis only underlined a possible delay in economic recovery in the West.        
	The dollar, therefore, may continue to lose its shine, and more and more nations will try to trade in their dollar reserves and US federal bonds for alternative reserves.         
	Gold, which is already up 32 per cent this year, is likely to gain more as central banks, pension funds and individual buyers seek to protect their assets from potential currency depreciation and inflation.         
	Most believe the gold market will remain bullish as US inflation expectations will continue to run high next year. Bullion traditionally draws strength from fears of higher inflation because it is regarded as a safe haven in times of economic uncertainty.         
	Analysts say that for the first time in more than two decades central banks will remain net buyers of gold.         
	Since India bought gold at market prices, Mauritius purchased two tonnes for $71.7 million and Sri Lanka 10 tonnes for $375 million.         
	The global markets expected China to buy the 200 tonnes, which the IMF had put up for sale and were purchased by the RBI.         
	Analysts said the high market prices might have dissuaded China from buying.        
	Besides, the country had increased domestic output to become the No. 1 producer in the world, and the analysts said it was buying its own gold to shore up its reserves.        
	Officials in the finance ministry, however, believe that China may trade in its huge stock of US federal bonds to buy some of the IMF gold. India will not compete with China to drive up gold prices but rather may consider buying if offered at market prices which do not seem too abnormal, the officials said.         
	As on November 13, 2009, India had total foreign exchange reserves of $286 billion, of which foreign currency reserves and gold constituted $263 billion and $17.5 billion, respectively .         
	The officials said that one of the reasons for India not being under any pressure to diversify is its relatively low holding of dollar bonds compared with many other countries.         
	India has about 12 per cent of its foreign exchange reserves in US treasury bonds compared with Brazils 64.63 per cent of reserves in US bonds, Russias 29.46 per cent and Chinas 35.15 per cent.         
	However, in the ultimate analysis most central banks would like to hold more bullion to strengthen its reserves value and India is no exception, the officials said.

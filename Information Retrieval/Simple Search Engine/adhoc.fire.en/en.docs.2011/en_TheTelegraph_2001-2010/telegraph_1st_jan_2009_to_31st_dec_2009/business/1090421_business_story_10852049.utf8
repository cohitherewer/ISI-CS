The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Sebi bar on Gujarat Heavy promoters
                                                                                                               Sebi bar on Gujarat Heavy promoters
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                               
	Mumbai, April 20: The Securities and Exchange Board of India has barred the promoters of soda ash maker Gujarat Heavy Chemicals Ltd from dealing in securities.         
	According to the regulator, Gujarat Heavy Chemicals (GHCL) has given wrong information to the stock exchanges about the promoters stake.        
	Those barred include chairman Sanjay Dalmia, managing director Ravi Shanker Jalan and company secretary Bhuwneshwar Mishra. There are 43 others who also cannot trade in securities until further orders.         
	Sebi had responded to a complaint about GHCL fudging the promoters stake in its quarterly filings to the bourses.        
	The regulator cross-checked the information to the bourses against that with GHCL registrar Link Intime India Private Limited and detected great discrepancies.        
	For instance, in the quarter ended September 30, 2008, GHCL reported that the promoter holding was around 40.30 per cent, whereas data with the registrar showed the holding to be only 18.02 per cent.        
	GHCL had misled the investors which is a serious offence by a listed company and its management, Sebi said.

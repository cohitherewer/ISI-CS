The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Car sales growth at 7-year low
                                                                                                               Car sales growth at 7-year low
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                                            
	New Delhi, April 8: Passenger car sales rose just 1.3 per cent in 2008-09  the slowest in seven years  because of high loan rates and uncertainty created by a sagging economy.        
	According to the Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers (SIAM), 1.22 million cars were sold during the year ended March 31, 2009, compared with 1.2 million a year ago. Sales had grown 12 per cent in 2007-08 and 22 per cent in 2006-07, outperforming the economy in both the years.        
	Car makers, however, expect sales to rise up to 5 per cent in 2009-10 on the back of the stimulus packages announced by the government to prop up the economy.         
	In December 2008 and in January this year, the government had cut central VAT on automobiles by 4 per cent and lowered excise duty to 8 per cent from 10 per cent. It also encouraged states to replace ageing buses with funds released under an urban renewal mission programme.        
	Passenger car sales may grow as much as 5 per cent this year on the back of launches and an improving economy, said Dilip Chenoy, SIAMs director-general. Auto analyst Murad Ali Baig said, There have been liquidity concerns. On a cautious note, we may see single-digit growth.        
	Car makers are pinning hopes on a series of launches, including that of Tata Motors Nano, to boost sales.         
	However, interest rates remain an area of concern.         
	The industry has been lobbying the government and bankers for easier financing norms. The top concerns are liquidity, working capital finance and interest rates, Chenoy said.         
	In India, around 80 per cent of the cars are bought on credit.

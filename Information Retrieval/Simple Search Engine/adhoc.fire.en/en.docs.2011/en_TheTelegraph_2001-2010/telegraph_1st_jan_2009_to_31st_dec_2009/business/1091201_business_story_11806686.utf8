                              An investor reacts to the stock slide at the Dubai Financial Market on Monday. (Reuters)                            
	Dubai, Nov. 30 (Reuters): The Dubai government said on Monday it was not responsible for the debts of Dubai World, its flagship conglomerate, offering little clarity on a plan to delay billions in debt repayments that had rattled world markets.        
	Dubai last week raised fears of a second bout of global financial turmoil by asking for a six-month repayment freeze on debt issued by Dubai World and its unit Nakheel, a property developer at the heart of the emirates boom.        
	Analysts said a statement by Dubais leading finance official shed little light on how much investors could lose in the process.         
	Creditors need to take part of the responsibility for their decision to lend to the companies. They think Dubai World is part of the government, which is not correct, said Abdulrahman Saleh, director-general of Dubais department of finance.        
	Saleh told Dubai TV that banks did not need extra liquidity and that the market reaction to Dubai Worlds restructuring had been overblown.         
	Dubai made its announcement on the eve of a holiday, sending global markets into a tailspin as investors awaited details of what it would mean for Dubai Worlds $59 billion in debts.        
	Asian stocks rebounded earlier on Monday from last weeks declines, but markets in the seven-member United Arab Emirates federation, which includes Dubai and Abu Dhabi, plummeted when they reopened after the four-day Eid al-Adha holiday.        
	Dubais market saw its biggest one-day decline since October 2008, and Abu Dhabis bourse saw its biggest-ever fall.         
	Salehs comments came after the markets had closed 7-8 per cent down.        
	Saleh made clear on Monday that while the government owned Dubai World, the conglomerate had long operated as a standalone entity and was never guaranteed by the emirates government.        
	It deals with all parties on this basis and it borrows based on ... its projects and not the guarantee of the government, Saleh said.        
	When contacted and asked whether Dubai could still repay its Nakheel bond, Saleh declined to comment.        
	Dubai World chairman Sultan Ahmed Bin Sulayem also declined to comment on Monday. Other Dubai World officials could not immediately be reached.        
	(This announcement) means that the banks are going to have an issue, said Vyas Jayabhanu, head of investments at Al Dhafra Financial. We still expect some action by the federal government eventually, otherwise it will ruin the economic sector.        
	Earlier in the day, Nakheel asked for three of its Islamic bonds, worth a total of $5.25 billion, to be suspended on the Nasdaq Dubai until it was in a position to fully inform the market.

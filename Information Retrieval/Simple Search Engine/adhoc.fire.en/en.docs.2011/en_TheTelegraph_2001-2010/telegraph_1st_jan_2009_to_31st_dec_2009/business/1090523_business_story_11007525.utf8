The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | LG increases sales growth target to 20%
                                                                                                               LG increases sales growth target to 20%
          SOUNAK MITRA                          Forward march                                  
	Calcutta, May 22: LG, a South Korean consumer electronics major, has revised the growth target for its Indian operations to over 20 per cent for 2009. The company had earlier projected an increase of 15 per cent or Rs 13,000 crore in its revenues from India.        
	Taking into consideration the growth rate we have registered in the first quarter (January-March), LG has revised its growth target in India. Nationally, the company has grown 27 per cent during the January-March quarter, LG Electronics India director (HR amp; MS) Yasho V. Verma told The Telegraph.         
	During the period, the director said, LGs market share grew about 1-4 per cent in each segment.         
	Against the sharp economic slowdown in the US and Europe, LG has identified India as a strategic market for its GSM phone business and has already announced that it would spend about Rs 400 crore in the mobile handset business in India.        
	Our share in the GSM market has grown substantially from around 3 per cent in December to about 7 per cent at the end of March. We are now targeting the No. 2 slot in the GSM market in India by October with a double-digit market share, Verma said.         
	At present, Nokia holds the top position in Indias GSM market with about 70 per cent share and Samsung has the second slot with around 8-9 per cent share in the domestic GSM handset market.         
	Verma also said the company was in the process of launching India-specific products and would invest about $80 million to develop these.        
	Earlier this year, Moon B Shin, LG Electronics Indias managing director, said the company had plans to launch more than 32 new models here, of which six would be touch phones, while many other models would be 3G- enabled.         
	LG now has about three touch phones and six 3G-enabled handsets in the domestic market.

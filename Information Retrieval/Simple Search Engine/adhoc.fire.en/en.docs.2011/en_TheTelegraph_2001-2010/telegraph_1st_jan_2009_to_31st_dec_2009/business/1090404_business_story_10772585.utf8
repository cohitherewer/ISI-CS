                                                                                                               Textile ministry move irks jute mills
          AMIT CHAKRABORTY                      Bitter truth                          
	Calcutta, April 3: The jute lobby is up in arms against the textile ministrys decision to allow the sugar industry to use packaging other than jute.        
	The ministry issued an order last week allowing the sugar industry to use alternative packing material such as polyethylene and polypropylene up to 20 per cent till May 1.        
	The move is being seen as a violation of the model code of conduct before the general elections.        
	The Indian Jute Mills Association (IJMA) has taken up the issue not only with the election commission (EC), but has also mobilised the Left parties to take up the matter with the commission.        
	According to the EC norms, no policy decision or announcement can be made by any department or ministry when the model code of conduct is in place. Despite the standing EC regulations, the textile ministry has gone ahead in issuing the dilution notification, the IJMA said.                                
	The ministry notification has cited a shortfall of 54,000 tonnes of A.Twill bags used for packing sugar in the 2008-09 sugar season because of an 18-day strike by the jute industry in Bengal.

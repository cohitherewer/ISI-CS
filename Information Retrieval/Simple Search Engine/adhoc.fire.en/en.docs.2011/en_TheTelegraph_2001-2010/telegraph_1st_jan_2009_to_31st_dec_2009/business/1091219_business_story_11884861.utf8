The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Money squeeze hint in Delhi meet
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Money squeeze hint in Delhi meet
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Mukherjee: Listing priorities                                  
	New Delhi, Dec. 18: The Reserve Bank of India may increase the cash reserve ratio (CRR) by 0.25-0.5 per cent to check a rampant surge in food prices. The CRR is the proportion of commercial bank money held compulsorily with the RBI.        
	A hike in CRR will mop up some of the money swirling in the system, thereby reducing the cash in hand of people.        
	RBI governor D. Subbarao today held a 45-minute meeting with finance minister Pranab Mukherjee in the grim backdrop of an almost 20 per cent food inflation for the week ended December 5.        
	According to finance ministry officials, the duo reviewed the situation and discussed the way out.        
	Prices of almost all essential items have surged in the first week of this month  pulses are costlier by 40 per cent and potatoes by a massive 136 per cent. Even staples have not been spared, with rice becoming dearer by almost 13 per cent and wheat, 14 per cent.        
	Mukherjee had admitted the situation was very serious and promised steps to ease the situation.         
	Earlier this week, the chairman of the Economic Advisory Council to the Prime Minister, C. Rangarajan, had said inflation this fiscal would cross the RBIs October projection of 6.5 per cent and could be close to 7 per cent.        
	Economists in the finance ministry said the price rise was mainly because of shortages and should be met by augmenting farm output and food imports. However, the rising price spiral was also fuelling inflationary expectations, necessitating measures to siphon out cash from the system. The CRR, now at 5 per cent, could be raised to 5.25-5.5 per cent, officials said.                   Subbarao: Weighing options      
	The RBIs next scheduled policy review is at the end of January, but the government can hardly wait for so long. Food prices are a politically sensitive issue. An onion crisis in the last decade had toppled a BJP government in Delhi. Onion prices are now up 15.4 per cent.        
	A parliamentary committee has also pulled up the finance ministry for not taking timely action.        
	In its report on inflation, the standing committee on finance, headed by BJPs Murli Manohar Joshi, said, The government has failed to intervene timely in addressing this burning issue (price rise) with due seriousness. Both the government and industry are keen on stable interest rates. A nascent industrial recovery, which saw second-quarter GDP growth shooting up to 7.9 per cent, needs to be nursed by continuous stimulus measures, many officials argue.         
	Industry associations said businesses considered prevailing interest rates of 12-15 per cent to be high, which explained the credit growth of just 9 per cent till October, while deposits grew 22 per cent.         
	Assocham has demanded a reduction of rates by at least 2 per cent, while Ficci wants an even higher reduction of 2.6 per cent.        
	In a letter to Mukherjee, Assocham president Swati Piramal has argued that credit growth is not happening, though banks are flush with funds.

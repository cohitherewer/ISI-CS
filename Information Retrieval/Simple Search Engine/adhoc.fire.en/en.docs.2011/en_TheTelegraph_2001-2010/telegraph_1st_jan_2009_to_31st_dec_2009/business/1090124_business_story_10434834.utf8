                                                                                                               iGATE keen to join race
                            
	New Delhi, Jan. 23 (PTI): Software firm iGATE today said it was interested in acquiring parts of Satyam Computer.        
	We are interested in a dialogue with Satyam and are comfortable to acquire selective portions of the business, iGATE chief Phaneesh Murthy said.        
	Earlier, newly appointed Satyam board member Tarun Das had said the company had been approached by domestic and overseas firms.        
	We have to wait for the new board at Satyam to evaluate all strategic options and then set the direction for the company before we comment on what our strategic plan is, Murthy said.        
	Another software company Tech Mahindra, however, said it was not interested in acquiring any business of Satyam. The question that is bothering everyone is the legal fallout of the class action suits and there can be unending open-ended liabilities, which have made everybody wary of treading the Satyam path, company vice-chairman and CEO Vineet Nayyar said.

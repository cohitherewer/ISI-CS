The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Twin steps to monitor food stocks
                                                                                                               Twin steps to monitor food stocks
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                    
	New Delhi, July 13: Spooked by rising food prices and a truant monsoon, the government today formed a group of ministers to monitor food security and reimposed the ban on wheat export.        
	After reviewing the monsoon and foodgrain scenario with officials of the India Meteorological Department and the agriculture ministry, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh directed the authorities to prepare a contingency plan. Singh today left for a five-day visit to France and Egypt.        
	The UPA is relying on an increase in farm output to put the economy back on the 9-per-cent growth trajectory and meet the poll promise of food security to the poor.         
	However, the acreage of all major crops has fallen below year-ago levels because of deficient rains, denting prospects of a bigger harvest of rice, oilseeds and sugarcane.        
	The group of ministers constituted today will consider the procurement and management of foodgrain stocks, revision of central issue prices and the proposed law on food security.         
	The seven-member ministerial panel, led by finance minister Pranab Mukherjee, will have agriculture minister Sharad Pawar, defence minister A.K. Antony, home minister P. Chidambaram, railway minister Mamata Banerjee, textiles minister Dayanidhi Maran and commerce minister Anand Sharma.         
	Planning Commission deputy chairman Montek Singh Ahluwalia will be a special invitee, a PMO statement said.        
	As part of the food management policy, the government has reimposed the ban on the export of up to nine lakh tonnes of wheat, 10 days after the ban was eased.        
	However, the director-general of foreign trade is yet to withdraw permission to export up to 6.5 lakh tonnes of wheat products by March-end next year.        
	The government had banned the export of wheat and its products in 2007 to boost domestic supply.        
	Economists said a poor monsoon could delay the countrys return to growth rates experienced before the global economic downturn.

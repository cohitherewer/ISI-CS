          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Wait lengthens                                  
	Calcutta, Feb. 23: The Bengal government today threw a spanner in Calcutta Port Trusts (CPT) plan to award a Rs 676-crore contract to a private party that could cost the port Rs 60 crore of revenue.        
	State transport secretary Sumantra Choudhury, who is a member of the CPTs board of trustees  the highest governing body of the port, strongly opposed the ports plan to award tenders to ABG Infralogistics and ABG Calcutta Container.        
	When contacted by The Telegraph, Choudhury said, I protested against the deal and walked out of the meeting.        
	It is learnt that 13 of the 22 board members were present at todays meeting.         
	The board took the decision that the management should clarify how the port would benefit from the deal before approving it.        
	The board also asked the management to get a clearance from the Central Vigilance Commissioner for the deal.        
	ABG had won the contract to put up mobile harbour cranes on berth 2 and 8 at Haldia, beating Sical Logistics and Tata Steel.        
	Under the contract, which was presented for the boards approval despite strong protest from the finance department of the CPT, the port was to pay the private party for handling cargo.         
	The private contractor would have to put up the crane at its own cost.        
	The contract will be valid for 10 years from the date of issue of letter of intent by the port to the company.

        Set a target and book your profits every time the return is achieved. Your investment in equities will never fail you if you follow this systematic approach, says Srikumar Bondyopadhyay                        
	The uncanny ways of the market since last year have left investors puzzled. The decline in share prices from January 2008 through March this year have wiped out most of the gains made in the previous three years. However, equities have historically given a higher return than any other asset class over a long period of time. So, where did they go wrong while investing in equities.        
	The key word is discipline. In equity investment, you will lose money if you are guided by emotions. But, if you make a disciplined effort to take out profits from the table in time, you will gain over a period.         
	Lets illustrate with the help of an example. Consider Investor A, who had invested Rs 10,000 in the sensex on January 1, 2006, and had set a target to book profits every time the index appreciates by 20 per cent and keep the redeemed amount in a savings bank account.         
	Till March 23 this year, the sensex rallied four times with an appreciation of over 20 per cent. On March 23, 2009, Investor As investment value stood at Rs 15,239.53 (see chart).         
	On the other hand, there is Investor B who preferred to hold on to his investment of Rs 10,000 through March 2009. Investor Bs principal appreciated to Rs 10,040 only.                  
	Be systematic  
	To be able to ride with the ups and downs of a volatile market, it is necessary that one books profits systematically.        
	Investor B would certainly have made more money than Investor A had the markets moved upwards in a secular trend. But that rarely happens.         
	In fact, data available with market regulator Sebi show that the volatility in the domestic stock markets has increased significantly in the last few years owing to a greater integration with the global economies.        
	When markets are volatile, a strategy of systematic investment and profit booking ensures reasonable return with lower risks. While systematic investment plan helps in cost averaging, regular profit booking at a targeted return ensures that there is a reasonable gain.         
	You can re-enter the markets when the stock prices are low and there is a high probability of a rise in investment value.         
	Thus, you can achieve your financial goals without taking much risk.         
	Asset rejig        
	Systematic profit booking also helps to rebalance assets  an investor can reinvest the booked profit in fixed-income instruments and earn an additional return thereon.        
	Know your target        
	The crux here is to determine the target rate of return. For this, you shall have to know your financial goals, the time span you have to achieve these goals and the capital you can invest. Once you know these three parameters, you can work out the annual rate of return you need to achieve your financial goals in the given time period.         
	This annual rate of return commensurate with your financial goals should be your trigger to book profits every time the return is achieved. In theory, the lower the trigger percentage you choose, the lesser you will be exposed to the risks and rewards of equity.        
	An eye on trigger        
	Systematic profit booking at a target return requires active monitoring of ones investment portfolio that many wont find easy.         
	ICICI Prudential Mutual Fund has launched a Target Returns Fund, an open-ended equity scheme, having an in-built trigger mechanism that enable investors to book profits automatically whenever the target return is achieved.         
	The scheme offers four trigger options: 12 per cent, 20 per cent, 50 per cent and 100 per cent.         
	An investor will have to choose one trigger option from this set of four and whenever that return is achieved, either the profit amount or the entire investment will be switched to any of the four selected debt schemes at the discretion of the investor.         
	The four select debt schemes are ICICI Pru Floating Rate Fund, Short-term Debt Fund, Liquid Fund and Income Plan.         
	Value Research, a Delhi-based firm that tracks mutual funds, conducted an investment simulation on this mechanism and the results are encouraging.         
	It assumed an initial investment of Rs 1 lakh made in a fund that invested in stocks comprising the BSE100 (which ICICI Pru Target Returns Fund proposes to do) in January 2005.         
	The trigger level of 12 per cent was chosen for the simulation.         
	Every time 12 per cent returns were made, the profits were switched to ICICI Prudential Income Fund.         
	At the end of March this year, only Rs 51,000 of the initial investment of Rs 1 lakh remained in the equity fund as the crash took its toll, while the profits transferred to the income funds were worth Rs 1.55 lakh. The total investment value, thus, stood at Rs 2.06 lakh.         
	Had the initial amount of Rs 1 lakh remained in the equity fund, it would now have been worth Rs 1.51 lakh.         
	Its thus clear that such triggers are a good way of booking profits and ensure better returns with lower risk.         
	You can apply the strategy of systematic investment and profit booking in any other equity scheme.         
	In that case, you will have to monitor the trigger levels yourself and exercise the sell call. You are also free to reinvest the profit amount in any instrument of your choice.

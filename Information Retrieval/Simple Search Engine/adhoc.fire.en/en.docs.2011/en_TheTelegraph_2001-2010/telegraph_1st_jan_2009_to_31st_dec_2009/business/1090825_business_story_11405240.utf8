The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | 3G base price set to be fixed
                                                                                                               3G base price set to be fixed

	New Delhi, Aug. 24: The group of ministers on 3G, which will meet later this week, is likely to agree to the minimum base price recommended by the finance ministry for the auction of spectrum.        
	The Prime Ministers Office and the finance ministry, who expect 3G mobile phone services to attract foreign players and generate high revenues, want the minimum bid price to be Rs 4,040 crore.         
	In its budget estimates, the government had stated that the sale of 3G spectrum would fetch Rs 35,000 crore.        
	With a drought-like situation threatening to widen the fiscal deficit, the government is keen on the sale of 3G spectrum to plug the gap.        
	The GoM is scheduled to meet on August 27. Earlier, it had met on July 31, when the department of telecom (DoT) had made presentations on issues related to the auction.        
	In July, telecom minister A. Raja and finance minister Pranab Mukherjee had agreed to double the reserve price to Rs 4,040 crore at a meeting with Prime Minister Manmohan Singh.        
	However, the issue was referred to a GoM to avoid controversies.        
	The Prime Minister is keen that 3G services should be available as soon as possible. Therefore, the panel will expedite the process of decision making. The auction can take place within two months of the panel finalising the base price and slots to be auctioned, DoT officials said.        
	After the auction, the winners will need another 3-5 months to roll out the services.         
	Telecom operators have already invested a lot in 3G infrastructure and want to start offering services. Moreover, with some companies testing fourth-generation technology, a final decision is expected soon, the officials said.         
	The DoT has been unable to hold auctions because of differences between ministries over a floor price and the number of players in each circle.         
	The telecom ministry wants to complete the auction by the end of 2009.         
	3G mobile phone services, seen as the next growth driver in Indian telecom, allow users to surf the Internet and download content, including music and video, at high speed.

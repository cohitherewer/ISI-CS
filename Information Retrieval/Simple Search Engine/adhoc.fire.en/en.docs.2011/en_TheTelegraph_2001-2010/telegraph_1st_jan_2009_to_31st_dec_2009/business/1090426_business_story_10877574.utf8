The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Mumbai firm bags port project
                                                                                                               Mumbai firm bags port project
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          New deal                                  
	Calcutta, April 25: The Calcutta Port Trust (CPT) today awarded the Haldia project to ABG Infralogistics, overcoming protests from a section of employees and divisions within the board of trustees.        
	Mumbai-based ABG Infralogistics, which will put up mobile cranes for berths 2 and 8 at Haldia, had emerged as the lowest bidder for the project last year. But because of protests and divisions the port could only make the official announcement today.        
	Earlier, the board of trustees had failed to arrive at a consensus on the decision to give ABG the contract. Some CPT officials were also opposed to the deal.        
	The matter went to the Central Vigilance Commission, the Election Commission and Calcutta High Court where a public interest litigation was filed by dissenting employees.        
	However, the port managements persistence, led by chairman Anup K. Chanda, finally prevailed. ABG will invest Rs 150 crore to put up the cranes which will handle bulk cargo like coal. Each berth will be able to handle up to 4 million tonnes of load.        
	Under the present contract, the CPT management said it would gain Rs 55 crore annually. The board also said the revenue-sharing model, as demanded by some port officials, would result in a deficit of Rs 27 crore every year.         
	The management claimed the port would benefit from the modernisation plan through reduced handling charges and less delays during berthing        
	Shipping lines can bring gearless vessel which can give savings of $4 or Rs 200 a tonne. Another Rs 200 can be saved through increased productivity as ships will spend less time on the berth, a port official said.        
	The CPT is likely to charge Rs 171 per tonne for handling the cargo. Of this Rs 171, the port will pay Rs 75 a tonne to ABG. At present, users pay Rs 120-240 per tonne of cargo as stevedores handle bulk of the operations. The rates charged by the stevedores are not controlled by the port.         
	However, the award of the contract is likely to face legal challenges.

	Calcutta, Sept. 4: Canon India hopes to garner at least 25 per cent of its revenue from government projects over the next two years.        
	This year, we aim to get Rs 200 crore from government projects, senior vice-president Alok Bharadwaj told The Telegraph today.         
	Canon is also looking forward to tying up with other technology firms to participate in the Unique Identification Database (UID) programme.        
	The company has a separate department to cater to various government projects.         
	It has identified state and central bodies, government departments and 14 ministries as customers for its imaging solutions.        
	Bharadwaj said the governments decision to digitise documents would open up opportunities.         
	We are ready to meet this demand as we have all kinds of solutions in our basket starting from scanning to photocopying to archiving in Web format. Our software developers are also constantly working to bring newer offerings on this front, he said.        
	The company today launched its new range of cameras and camcorders here, targeting the Puja buyers.

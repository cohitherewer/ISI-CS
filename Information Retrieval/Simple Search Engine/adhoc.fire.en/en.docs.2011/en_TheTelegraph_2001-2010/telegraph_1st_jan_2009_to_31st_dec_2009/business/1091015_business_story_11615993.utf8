The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Panel sees 6.5% growth
                                                                                                               Panel sees 6.5% growth
                            
	New Delhi, Oct. 14 (PTI): The Prime Ministers economic panel today said the economy was likely to grow around 6.5 per cent in the current fiscal against 6.7 per cent a year ago because of a decline in farm production on the back of a deficient monsoon.        
	I think we are providing for a fairly substantial growth rate in industrial production and in the service sector, even some decline in the agricultural growth rate. However, 6.5 per cent appears to be a reasonable rate, C. Rangarajan, chairman of the Prime Ministers Economic Advisory Council, said.        
	Rangarajan sees growth between 6 per cent and 6.5 per cent in the current fiscal. Perhaps, it would be closer to the upper end of my range, he said.        
	If the Indian economy grows around 6.5 per cent this fiscal, economic expansion will be lower than last years but quite reasonable as the global financial crisis has considerably slowed down growth since September 2008.        
	After the collapse of Lehman Brothers, the economy could manage a growth of 5.8 per cent in the last two quarters of 2008-09. In the first quarter of this fiscal, it grew 6.1 per cent.         
	This also means that industry and services are likely to show substantial growth and will make up for the expected decline in farm output in the current fiscal.        
	Industrial growth zoomed to a 22-month high of 10.4 per cent in August, but because of a lower expansion in the initial months it could grow just 5.8 per cent in the first five months of this fiscal. Rangarajan further said overall growth of the manufacturing sector, which constituted around 80 per cent of the index of industrial production, would be around 8 per cent.        
	Manufacturing grew just 5.5 per cent during the first five months of this fiscal.         
	The Reserve Bank has projected the economy to grow 6 per cent with an upward bias in the current fiscal, while the Planning Commission sees the growth rate at 6.3 per cent.

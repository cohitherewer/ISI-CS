The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Longer wait for telecom newbies
                                                                                                               Longer wait for telecom newbies
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                          Network jam                                  
	New Delhi, Aug. 5: The government is unlikely to issue new second-generation (2G) licences till it comes up with a clear policy on spectrum allocation and pricing.        
	The move will delay the entry of companies such as AT amp;T, Sterlite, Moser Baer, and Videocon into the fast-growing mobile market. These firms have been waiting to launch services for two years.        
	According to the recommendations of the telecom regulator, we are planning to halt the grant of new 2G licences till a policy on spectrum allocation, pricing and number of players in each circle is finalised, said an official of the Department of Telecommunications (DoT). A formal decision is expected soon.         
	The official said the ministry would have to wait for the telecom regulators recommendations before taking a call. If we have asked for Trais views on certain issues, we have to wait for it to reply before proceeding.        
	The Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai) has proposed that since it is undertaking a comprehensive exercise on these issues, the DoT may keep in abeyance the grant of any new access licence till the finalisation of these recommendations.

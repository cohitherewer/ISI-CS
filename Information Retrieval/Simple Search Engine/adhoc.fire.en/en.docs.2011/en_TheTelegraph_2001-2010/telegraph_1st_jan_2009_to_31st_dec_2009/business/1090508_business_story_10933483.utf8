The strength of its (Great Offshore) diversified fleet along with the strong financial performance and healthy position make it a highly valuable investment proposition for Bharati, said Bharati Shipyard managing director Vijay Kumar.        
	Bharati Shipyard currently owns five shipyards, including those in Thane, Calcutta, Mangalore and Ratnagiri. According to a release issued by the company, Bharati Shipyard has an order book position of Rs 5,093.71 crore.

                                                                                                               Early-alert system to check fraud
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                          Close watch                                  
	New Delhi, June 5: The government is keen to scrutinise the quarterly financial results of companies as part of a plan to build an early-warning system against corporate fraud, sources said.        
	Quarterly financial reports filed by listed companies with the Securities and Exchange Board of India could be obtained and scrutinised by the corporate affairs ministry to find out discrepancies and take appropriate actions, the sources said.        
	Such steps have become necessary following the Satyam scam. The corporate affairs ministry wants to take advance action to prevent a repeat of Satyam.        
	Besides the quarterly financial statements, the ministry is also looking at the option of seeking information on initial public offerings to find out whether the funds have been used for the purposes declared in the prospectus.         
	Currently, listed companies are required to submit annual financial statements with the Registrar of Companies, though they file such statements every quarter with the Seibu. The early warning mechanism, the modalities of which are still being discussed, will help in avoiding corporate frauds, said the sources.        
	Corporate affairs minister Salman Khursheed had recently said that he would give top priority to nail the culprits in the Satyam scam; at the same time he would like to initiate measures to prevent a repeat of the fiasco.        
	Open offer         
	Tech Mahindra has extended the date for approaching the shareholders of Satyam Computer regarding its Rs 1,154-crore open offer for the purchase of a 20 per cent stake in the scam-hit firm.        
	In a filing to the BSE, Satyam Computer said the last date by which the letter of offer would be dispatched to the shareholders has been revised to June 9, from the earlier scheduled date of June 3.        
	Further, the last date of withdrawal by shareholders has also been revised to June 26 from the earlier June 27.

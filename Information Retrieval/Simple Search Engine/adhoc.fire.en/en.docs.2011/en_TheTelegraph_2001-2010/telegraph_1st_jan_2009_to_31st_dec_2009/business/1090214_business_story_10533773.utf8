	New Delhi, Feb. 13: The era of Vodafone-style takeovers  where overseas entities buy out Indian entities in cross-border deals without seeking prior government approval  is finally over.        
	The government today said the control and management (of a firm) would no longer be through the transfer of shares in sectors such as telecom, airlines, defence and information and broadcasting where FDI is capped at a certain limit.        
	It also specified that there would be no transfer of ownership and management control to any foreign entity without prior government approval.        
	Vodafone had acquired a 67 per cent stake in Hutchison Essar for $11.1 billion in February 2007. Vodafone and Hutchison Telecom International Ltd, which owned the stake in the Indian telecom player, struck the deal outside India. Later, Vodafone applied for government clearances.        
	A foreigner may hold 40 per cent in a telecom company. Later, he could raise his holding to 74 per cent with the transfer of ownership and control. This will now require government approval, said commerce minister Kamal Nath.        
	Owned in this context will mean having more than 50 per cent shareholding. Controlled would mean that the owners must have the power to appoint the majority of board directors and legally direct the boards actions through a managing director who is their nominee.        
	Foreign investment in holding companies that are owned and controlled by Indians will not be taken into account while calculating the foreign holding in downstream operating units like telecom and airlines. At present, foreign investment in telecom companies is capped at 74 per cent and that in airlines at 49 per cent.        
	The clauses on ownership and control have been put in at the insistence of the home ministry, which was concerned about surreptitious transfer of ownership of companies in sensitive sectors without informing the government.        
	It will also help the revenue authorities to realise taxes. Vodafone did not deduct a withholding tax of around $2 billion while making the payment to Hutchison Telecom International and has since been stuck with a tax tab that it is challenging.        
	Nath said the indirect investment rule would not apply to either the insurance or the retail sectors. The commerce minister told reporters that the new policy would not allow backdoor entry into retail but the assertion has failed to convince analysts and Left leaders.         
	In these depressed times, capital is not easily available. This (new FDI rule) will help in bringing funds, from foreign investors who consider India to be a good investment destination, but not (specifically) for the purposes of control and management, said Nath.        
	The government also introduced a special feature whereby the Indian shareholder would have to have at least 51 per cent of the total equity in I amp;B and defence sectors.        
	The government will issue detailed guidelines on the changed FDI policy on February 16. Nath also said there must be full disclosure of any shareholders inter se agreements which has an effect on ownership and control. Any beneficial interest that a foreigner may have will also have to be disclosed, he said        
	The government has also defined the types of instruments that would be taken into consideration for calculating indirect foreign investment. These include FDI, portfolio investments by FIIs, investments by NRIs, ADRs , GDRs, foreign currency convertible bonds and foreign currency convertible debentures.

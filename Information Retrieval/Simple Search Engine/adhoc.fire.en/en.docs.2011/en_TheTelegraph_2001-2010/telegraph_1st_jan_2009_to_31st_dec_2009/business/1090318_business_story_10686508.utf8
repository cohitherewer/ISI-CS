The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Telenor hammers down Unitech deal value
                                                                                                               Telenor hammers down Unitech deal value
          OUR BUREAU                                            
	March 17: After months of uncertainty and a free fall in stock prices, buyout barons are aggressively renegotiating acquisition deals they struck just a few months ago.        
	Norwegian firm Telenors acquisition of Unitech Wireless, the telecom subsidiary of realtor Unitech, is the latest deal where the valuation has been hammered down.        
	On Tuesday, Unitech Wireless announced that Telenor would pick up a 67.25 per cent stake in the company compared with the 60 per cent that was offered when the deal was struck in October. The payout remains pegged at Rs 6,120 crore (around $1.2 billion).        
	This will bring down the enterprise value of Unitech Wireless from Rs 11,620 crore to Rs 10,900 crore under the new terms of the agreement.         
	Telenor and Unitech have agreed to proceed with the transaction with certain adjustments. While Telenors initial investment will continue to be the previously agreed $1.2 billion, Telenor, after this investment, would hold 67.25 per cent in Unitech Wireless (subject to regulatory approvals), the spokesperson said.        
	He cited market conditions and a steep depreciation of the rupee as factors that have resulted in this downward adjustment of Unitech Wirelesss enterprise value.         
	Under the terms of the new deal, realty major Unitech  the parent of Unitech Wireless  will get about Rs 400 crore against advances it gave to its subsidiary. Unitech is expected to use the cash to retire debt.        
	We want to repay all advances that Unitech had taken for operations of the telecom firm, said Unitech managing director Sanjay Chandra.        
	Upon completion of the first phase of the investment, Telenor will own 33.5 per cent as against 26 per cent under the previous terms of the deal. The subscription for new shares in Unitech Wireless by Telenor will be completed in four phases.        
	Unitech Wireless expects the first tranche of payment of Rs 1,250 crore to flow in as early as next week. Unitech, which is shouldering a considerable debt burden, will not have to fund the capital expenditure of Unitech Wireless for two years after the Telenor deal, the spokesperson said.        
	A few months ago, Telenor had decided to kill its $1.8-billion rights issue to fund the Unitech Wireless acquisition and instead opted to take on more debt and use cash accumulated as a result of not paying out dividends.        
	The Oslo-headquartered Telenor has operations in Bangladesh, Pakistan, Malaysia and Thailand. With over 65 million subscribers in Asia, it is the fourth-largest player in this market after SingTel, NTT DoComo and Vodafone.        
	Department of telecom officials said Telenor could face problems in securing regulatory approvals because of its operations in Pakistan and Bangladesh. Other firms have faced similar security issues.        
	Unitech Wireless is not an isolated case. Anil Agarwal-owned Sterlite Industries recently renegotiated the price it paid for US-based copper producer Asarco. Sterlite coughed up $1.7 billion, a price that is 35 per cent lower than what Sterlite was open to pay in May last year. Weak demand for copper and the prolonged slowdown helped Sterlite renegotiate the deal.        
	With deals like Sterlite-Asarco and Telenor-Unitech being closed at renegotiated prices, it is clear that promoters have adjusted to lower valuations, said an investment banker.         
	This trend is likely to continue till we see an upturn. Valuations will also change in structured deals without a renegotiation as these type of transactions are pegged to variables, he added.

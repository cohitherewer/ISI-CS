The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Buzz on auction of extra 2G spectrum

          JAYATI GHOSE                          Select option                                  
	New Delhi, Dec. 12: Mobile operators are in favour of buying additional second-generation (2G) spectrum through open bidding.        
	At present, a telecom licence comes bundled with 4.4 megahertz (MHz) of GSM spectrum, which is the minimum amount required to launch mobile services.         
	After this, companies are awarded an additional 1.8MHz, subject to a pre-defined subscriber base.        
	As radiowaves are scarce resources, spectrum beyond 6.2MHz could be sold at market prices instead of giving it on the basis of subscriber additions, Stein-Erik Vellan, managing director of Unitech Wireless, told The Telegraph.        
	Unitech, which recently launched operations in India, also said up to 6.2MHz should be given to operators without any additional charge.        
	According to licence conditions, up to 6.2MHz of GSM spectrum are allotted on achieving a certain number of subscribers.        
	There is a suggestion to treat 6.2MHz GSM spectrum as threshold and allot spectrum beyond this through auction. But this will amount to a change in existing guidelines and appropriate amendments will be necessary after this approach is approved in-principle, said DoT officials.        
	A recent open house organised by the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai) on 2G spectrum pricing and allocation also discussed the auction route for allocation of 2G spectrum, they added.        
	The finance and law ministries have always favoured the auction route for both new entrants and existing operators who require additional frequencies to expand their services.        
	Bharti Airtel, the countrys largest operator, has told Trai that it strongly supports the recommendation of a government panel that 2G spectrum beyond 4.4MHz for existing licence-holders should be auctioned and not linked to the number of subscribers.         
	Once an operator pays the market-driven price, the market will determine the rewards and the punishments in case the operator does not use the spectrum efficiently, said Bharti in its communication to Trai.         
	A recent spectrum committee set up by the DoT to review the policy has recommended auction while doing away with the subscriber-based criteria.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Mumbai, July 9: The first-quarter earnings season starts tomorrow, and the forecast is not quite encouraging.         
	Infosys Technologies will be the first to come out with its results. The topline of the IT bellwether in rupee terms is expected to decline around 5 per cent sequentially, while the net profit is projected to be around Rs 1,400 crore for the quarter ended June 30.        
	Analysts say the muted numbers are likely to be accompanied by a drop in operating margins because of lower volumes and the appreciation of the rupee against the dollar.         
	However, a favourable cross-currency movement of the US dollar against other global currencies such as the euro could help the IT company offset the decline.         
	Cross-currency revenues contribute around 25 per cent to the topline of big IT companies. Infosys had posted a net profit of Rs 1,302 crore in the quarter ended June 30, 2008. While declaring the quarterly results for the period ended March 31, 2009, Infosys had projected that revenues could be in the range of Rs 5,379-5,480 crore for the first quarter, a year-on-year growth of 10.8-12.9 per cent but a sequential decline.        
	According to a research report from Sharekhan, the topline of leading IT companies is expected to decline 2-2.5 per cent sequentially in dollar terms in the first quarter of this year. The brokerage said volume growth of these companies was likely to remain sluggish and drop by 1-2 per cent during the quarter.        
	Analysts Ashwin Mehta and Vihang Naik at Motilal Oswal expect Infosys to report a net profit of Rs 1,355 crore, and said the company could report a 3 per cent volume decline.        
	Experts also did not rule out the possibility of the company revising upwards the guidance for the entire year because of the favourable cross-currency movement.

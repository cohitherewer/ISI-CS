	Calcutta, Dec. 30: Retail investors can buy and sell mutual fund units using their mobile phones from next year.         
	UTI Mutual Fund (UTIMF), the countrys oldest asset management company, is planning to introduce in January the facility for its investors to buy and sell units of various schemes of the fund house using their handsets.        
	There are five million (50 lakh) mobile phone users in the country. So, mobile telephone is the most effective technological device to reach out to more investors at a fractional cost, said Jaideep Bhattacharya, chief marketing officer, UTI Mutual Fund.        
	Bhattacharya had led the team formed by the Association of Mutual Funds in India for suggesting a common online transaction platform for mutual funds, which led to online trading platforms on the BSE.         
	UTI Mutual Fund is working hard to offer the facility to investors to buy and sell units using their handsets in a few weeks, he said. We are talking to a mobile telephony service provider and a few banks to offer this service.         
	Bhattacharya refused to give details about the mobile telephony service provider because of a confidentiality clause prior to the signing of an agreement.        
	UTIMF is already offering its investors mobile applications-based value-added services such as locating the nearest branch of UTIMF, request for an account statement, the lodging of complaints, updates on stock price indices on the BSE and NSE, SIP and debt calculators and access to daily NAVs of registered schemes.        
	As of now, the facility to buy and sell units using the mobile phone is not being provided. Well introduce this in a few weeks, Bhattacharya said.        
	However, investors willing to buy and sell their units over phones will have to get registered with the fund house. As of now, UTI mobile applications are available only on GPRS-enabled handsets.         
	Fund houses are finding it tough to acquire new businesses after Sebi banned mutual funds in August from paying agents commission and business expenses from the entry load. The mobile trading platform will give fund houses a wider and cheaper access to investors.        
	Market experts believe the introduction of mobile banking services will facilitate the transaction of other financial products as well.        
	It is only a matter of time that other fund houses follow UTIMF in launching their mobile (trading) services, said a senior official of a private sector mutual fund house.

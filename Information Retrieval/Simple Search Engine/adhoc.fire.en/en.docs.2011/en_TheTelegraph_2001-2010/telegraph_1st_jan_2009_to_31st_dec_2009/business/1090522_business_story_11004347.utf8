The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Realty firms rue quick-fire deals
                                                                                                               Realty firms rue quick-fire deals
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Cash course                                  
	Mumbai, May 21: Real estate developers that scrambled to raise money through recent private placements could have struck better deals if they had just waited for the bounce back in the markets.        
	Last week, real estate players like DLF and Unitech used the qualified institutional placement (QIP) route to raise sorely needed cash.        
	However, Indiabulls Real Estate Ltd, which raised money early this week, and Housing Development and Infrastructure Ltd, which plans to float a QIP issue shortly, have been a lot smarter by deciding to wait for the upswing in stock prices.        
	DLF sold a 10 per cent stake in the company totalling 168 million shares at around Rs 230 per share. The share sale fetched the promoters Rs 3,860 crore. The DLF scrip has since flared up, closing at Rs 341.95 on Thursday when the sensex plunged 324 points.        
	Analysts said that if the promoters of DLF had waited for a week, they would have been able to rustle up Rs 5,745 crore through the sale of the same number of shares. Alternatively, they could have diluted a little less than 7 per cent to raise the same amount.         
	The same logic would apply to Unitech, the countrys second largest listed real estate player, which raised money long before DLF. Last month, the company raised over Rs 1,600 crore through a QIP by selling 42.11 crore shares at Rs 38.50 a share, amounting to around Rs 1,621 crore. This brings down the promoters stake from 64 per cent to 51 per cent.         
	On Thursday, the Unitech scrip closed at Rs 71.85 a share on the BSE. The company would have raised around Rs 3,025 crore if it had decided to hold out.         
	Alternatively, the promoters would have had to dilute around 7 per cent at Thursdays prices to raise Rs 1,621 crore.         
	In contrast, Indiabulls Real Estate raised Rs 2,656 crore through a sale of shares at Rs 185 a share this week that resulted in a roughly 9 per cent dilution of the promoters stake. The Indiabulls Real Estate scrip closed at Rs 205.30 a share on Thursday.        
	Mumbai-headquartered Housing Development amp; Infrastructure Ltd informed the BSE on Thursday that it would consider a proposal to raise funds through various means including the QIP route at its board meeting scheduled for May 23. Market sources said Sobha Developers was also planning to follow suit.

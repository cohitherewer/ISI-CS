The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Bid to raise public stake in firms 
                                                                                                               Bid to raise public stake in firms 
          PIYA SINGH                          People watch the BSE trading screen in Mumbai on Monday. (AFP)                                  
	Mumbai, July 6: An innocuous sounding sentence in finance minister Pranab Mukherjees budget speech is going to worry Indian promoters who have traditionally held very high stakes in the listed companies they manage. Even public sector companies may not be spared.         
	 The finance minister said the average public float in Indian listed companies was less than 15 per cent and deep, non-manipulable markets require larger and diversified public shareholdings.        
	 According to the finance ministrys calculations, this applies to both private and public sector companies. Mukherjee proposes to raise, in a phased manner, the threshold for non-promoter public shareholding for all listed companies.        
	 So far, the Securities Exchange Board of India stipulates that those companies who float a public issue of 100 crore and over should have a 10 per cent public shareholding whereas those who fall below this mark should have a 25 per cent public float.        
	 Sources said the finance ministry had also been debating this issue with Sebi for a while now and this could be a signal to the regulatory body to expedite the move. In this backdrop, the finance ministers statement on the percentage of public float raises more questions than offer clarity on the proposal to raise the percentage of public float.        
	 It is usually Sebis call so is the finance minister trying to offer a feel-good factor to small investors? Or, is there soon going to be a move to increase the 10 per cent public float to 15 or 20 per cent, said Prithvi Haldea of Prime Database who tracks the public markets.        
	A foreign institutional investor who invests in India said, It is important to see what time frame the minister had in mind. Is Sebi going to call an emergency meeting tomorrow? Will companies such as DLF who diluted 10 per cent recently have to go to the public again?        
	And then there is a grey area as far as public sector companies are concerned. On the one hand, the government plans to raise only about Rs 1,100 crore from divestment and on the other, there are several large PSUs such as ONGC Ltd that have a very low public float. If these PSUs do go in for a public issue this year, there seems to be a mismatch between what the divestment proceeds are likely to bring in and the intention to increase the public float of government-owned firms, Haldea said.         
	Others see the ministers statement as words of encouragement to Indian firms to go in for public issues. Indian companies that may be loath to go in for a public issue fearing lower prices will probably get some time to implement an increase in public float. The finance minister is probably trying to meet the twin objectives of meeting the funding needs of corporate and encouraging higher levels of a public float, said PricewaterhouseCoopers executive director Krishan Malhotra.

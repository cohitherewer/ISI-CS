          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                            
	Mumbai, Oct. 9: Infosys Technologies kicked off the second-quarter earnings season today with strong profit numbers that beat the Streets estimates  and raised market expectations of a robust performance by India Inc.        
	The countrys second largest software exporter reported a 7.5 per cent growth in net profit at Rs 1,540 crore compared with Rs 1,432 crore earned in the same quarter a year ago. The consensus estimate on the Street was a net profit of Rs 1,510 crore.        
	The IT bellwether also upped its revenue guidance for the full year ending March 31. The overall income has been forecast to be in the range of Rs 21,961 crore to Rs 22,055 crore, a year-on-year growth of 1.2-1.7 per cent.        
	The positive revenue guidance fuelled optimism that the worst was over for infotech companies that had seen their margins mauled by the global economic slowdown.        
	When Infosys announced its first quarter results in July, it had forecast that income for the year would be in the range of Rs 21,416 crore to Rs 21,747 crore, a year-on-year decline of 3.7-5.4 per cent.        
	In dollar terms, Infosys said consolidated revenues for the year were expected to be in the range of $4.60 billion to $4.62 billion, a decline of 1-1.3 per cent. Back in July, it had forecast a 3-4.6 per cent fall in dollar revenues this year.        
	The business climate has improved, said S.Gopalakrishnan, CEO and managing director of Infosys. The clients are now looking to invest in a few strategic initiatives and relationships to maximise value from opportunities when the economic downturn ends. He told reporters in Bangalore that clients had started to take decisions on their IT investments and the company had started seeing signs of pricing stability.        
	However, there is one blip: the forecast for income in the third quarter ending December 31 is in the range of Rs 5,429 crore to Rs 5,476 crore, which would be 2.79 per cent to 1.95 per cent lower than the Rs 5,585 crore achieved in the second quarter. However, analysts believed that this reflected the conservative nature that the company had always shown.        
	During the quarter, Infosys added 35 clients with a gross addition of 6,069 employees.        
	However, the results failed to prop up the stock which wilted on heavy selling to end at Rs 2,178.35, a loss of 1.49 per cent, or Rs 32.90, over Thursdays close. On the BSE, the stock had opened strong at Rs 2,255.55 against the last close of Rs 2,211.25.        
	Market circles said the stock fell because of the strong rupee and the impact that this could have on the entire IT pack.         
	The Indian currency has surged nearly 13 per cent from a level of Rs 52 to a dollar in March because of strong inflows. The rupee, which closed today at Rs 46.40 against the greenback, is expected to appreciate further in the coming months.

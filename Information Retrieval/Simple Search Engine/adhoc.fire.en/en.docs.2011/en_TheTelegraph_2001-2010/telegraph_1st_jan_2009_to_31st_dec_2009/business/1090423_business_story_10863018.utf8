	New Delhi, April 22: Gems and jewellery makers are keen to tap new export markets and grow 5 per cent in this fiscal, against just 1.5 per cent growth in 2008-09.        
	It seems the global slowdown is bottoming out and we expect to grow at about 3-5 per cent in 2009-10, Rajiv Jain, vice-chairman of the Gems and Jewellery Export Promotion Council, told The Telegraph.        
	The focus is on West Asia, South Africa, China and the CIS countries.        
	Gems and jewellery is Indias No. 1 export having a 13 per cent share.        
	The global recession has dealt a severe blow to the sector, with many artisans in the export hubs of Gujarat and Maharashtra losing their jobs.         
	Over 30 lakh are engaged in the work, and as many as 1.5 lakh have become unemployed.        
	Jain said exporters planned to tap new markets, while betting on a rebound in the US and Europe.        
	Commerce ministry officials said a revival of gems and jewellery was crucial to Indias export revival and an indicator that the global economy was making a comeback.        
	The biggest market is the UAE with a 31 per cent share, followed by Hong Kong with 25 per cent and the US with 20 per cent.        
	By July-August 2009, we hope the market will improve, Jain said.        
	The growth in the sector was primarily driven by gold jewellery (exports), which registered an increase of 23.64 per cent in fiscal 2008-09, Vasant Mehta, chairman of the council, said.        
	Cut and polished diamonds exports witnessed a decline of 8.24 per cent to $13.02 billion in the last fiscal from $14.19 billion in 2007-08.

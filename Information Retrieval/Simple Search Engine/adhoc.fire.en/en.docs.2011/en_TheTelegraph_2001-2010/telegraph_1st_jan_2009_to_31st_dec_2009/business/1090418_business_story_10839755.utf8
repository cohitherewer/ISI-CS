The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Iran gas attracts ONGC
                                                                                                               Iran gas attracts ONGC

	New Delhi, April 17: Oil and Natural Gas Corporation Ltd (ONGC) plans to invest up to $3 billion in the Farzad gasfield in Iran.        
	The company had submitted a plan to the Iranian government to extract 1.1 billion cubic feet of natural gas from the region and turn it into liquefied natural gas for export. The plan is expected to get approval soon.        
	The Farzad gasfield is part of the Farsi block, which is operated by ONGC Videsh Ltd along with Indian Oil. ONGC Videsh, which holds a 40 per cent stake in the 3,500sqkm offshore block, found oil in the block in 2006 when it drilled three wells.        
	India had earlier pulled out of a gas pipeline project with Iran and Pakistan because of differences over price. Observers, however, felt the pullout was partly because of pressure from the US which did not want India to strengthen its ties with Iran. Moreover, India had its own security concerns over bringing gas through Pakistan.         
	With the US easing its relations with Iran, India can explore the country more intensively and compete with China, which had bagged many oil blocks.         
	Earlier, India had proposed an undersea gas pipeline for gas from West Asia.         
	A proposal to set up such a pipeline from Oman is being reviewed once again, said officials. The project could cost about half of what it would have cost to build an overland pipeline through Pakistan.         
	The consortium which had planned the undersea link  South Asia Gas Enterprise  has given presentations to the Indian government and has been in talks with state-run gas transportation firm GAIL and fertiliser companies here.         
	The British-led consortium proposes to lay the pipeline between Omans Ras al Jifan and coastal Gujarats Rapar Gadhwali to ferry about eight trillion cubic feet of gas.

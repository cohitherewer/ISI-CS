          OUR CORRESPONDENT                          Connecting call                                   
	New Delhi, Nov. 23: Telecom firm Sistema-Shyam can proceed with its plan to sell around 20 per cent equity to the Russian government.        
	The permission for the sale came from the telecom ministry today. Sistema-Shyam is a joint venture between Russias Sistema and the Shyam group.         
	The Russian government will acquire the 20 per cent equity holding in the telecom firm for $676 million, said sources. The deal values Sistema-Shyam at around $3.5 billion.         
	The ministry had earlier opposed the sale as it believed that the promoters would offload their own stake, which was against the rules.        
	Subsequently, on clarification from the owners that new shares would be issued, the ministry gave the approval.        
	Telecom rules bar owners from selling stakes for three years but do allow them to issue new shares.        
	Sistema-Shyam was among the nine companies to get licences last year.        
	The company, which operates under the MTS brand, is now awaiting approval from the Foreign Investment Promotion Board.        
	Sources said after the stake sale, Sistemas holding in the joint venture would come down to around 54 per cent. There will be no change in the shareholding of Shyam.        
	Sistema, owned by the Russian government, holds 73.71 per cent and Shyam, 23.79 per cent. The rest 2.5 per cent of Sistema-Shyam is with the the public.        
	The Russian government will fund the acquisition by using the money under the rupee-rouble debt agreement.         
	Analysts said the stake sale would provide the company with sufficient funds for its expansion in India.        
	The company plans to roll out its mobile services in all the circles by 2010 and expects to grow the subscriber base at the rate of 5 lakh to one million every month.

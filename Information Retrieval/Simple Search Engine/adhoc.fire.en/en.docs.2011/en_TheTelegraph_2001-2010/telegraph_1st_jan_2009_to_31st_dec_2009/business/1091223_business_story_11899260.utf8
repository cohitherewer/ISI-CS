The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Taro Pharma campaign to block Sun
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Taro Pharma campaign to block Sun
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Drug tiff                                  
	Mumbai, Dec. 22: Taro Pharma chairman Barrie Levitt is reaching out to investors to head off a shareholder revolt at the crucial annual general meeting on December 31 even as an angry war of words escalates with Sun Pharma.        
	Sun Pharma, which holds a 36 per cent stake in the Israeli drugmaker, is pushing for a rejection of management-sponsored resolutions to re-elect eight directors, including Levitt. The Levitt-Moro combine owns just 11 per cent in Taro.        
	The Dilip Shanghvi-owned Sun Pharma is also seeking to block a resolution that will indemnify Taro directors against any suits claiming damages for poor governance and the failure to produce financial results since 2006.        
	On Monday, Levitt wrote a letter to Mark Mobius, chairman of Templeton Asset Management Company Ltd, urging the investment firm to support the Taro management.        
	Templeton, which holds 13.1 per cent in Taro, had initially backed Levitt but has now decided to vote against the existing management after Sun highlighted the serious fiduciary lapses of the Taro directors.        
	Taros battle with Sun Pharma dates back to 2007 when Shanghvi had provided $60 million to the Israeli firm and pulled it back from the brink of bankruptcy. At that time, Taro had offered share warrants to Sun but then refused to convert them into shares, which would have given Sun control over the company.        
	If the board is not re-elected, Taro will be leaderless. In the ensuing confusion, Sun may attempt to take control of Taro without paying a fair price to shareholders, Taro told its shareholders in an earlier letter on December 18.        
	After making a plea to Mobius urging him to reject Suns bid to overturn the Taro board, Levitt claimed that even if the shareholders voted against the indemnification proposal it would not hurt the Taro directors as they would be able to seek protection under an earlier resolution.        
	Taro claimed that in 2005, its shareholders had approved indemnification of directors to the fullest extent permitted by law and the current proposal is for ratification of existing indemnification and does not add anything beyond the fullest extent permitted by law.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                           Anil Ambani in New Delhi on Tuesday. Picture by Prem Singh                                  
	New Delhi, Nov. 24: The Supreme Court had a surprise visitor today in Anil Ambani, who attended the hearing of the Krishna-Godavari basin gas case, in which he is involved in a no-holds-barred battle with brother Mukesh.        
	My presence in the Supreme Court reflects my deepest regard for our judiciary, Anil said. I have come here not just on my own behalf but on behalf of millions of shareholders of the Anil Dhirubhai Ambani group whose interests will be directly affected by the outcome of this case.        
	Anils arrival created a buzz among the lawyers and media, who stormed inside the courtroom and followed him to the lawyers chamber where he visited Ram Jethmalani, who is fighting the gas case on behalf of Reliance Natural Resources Limited.        
	I had asked him (Anil) to come to the Supreme Court. I had to discuss some things on the memorandum of understanding (brokered by their mother Kokilaben, between Mukesh and Anil), Jethmalani said.        
	At the hearing today, Jethmalani continued with his argument that there was no ambiguity in the agreed price, tenure and quantity of natural gas to be supplied by Mukeshs Reliance Industries to RNRL from Krishna-Godavari. The only issue in the case was the absence of a bankable agreement.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Wal-Mart to arrive next week
                                                                                                               Wal-Mart to arrive next week

	New Delhi, May 20: Wal-Mart, the worlds largest retailer, is set to open its first cash-and-carry centre in India next week.        
	After years of controversy and opposition from local retailers and politicians, Bharti Wal-Mart, the joint venture between Bharti Enterprises and Wal-Mart, will open its first centre in Amritsar, a spokesman said on Wednesday. It will open early next week, said Arun Mowar, spokesperson for Wal-Mart in India.        
	The plan is to open 10 more big-box outlets in India over the next two years. However, Indian consumers wont be able to partake of Wal-Marts everyday low prices. Wal-Marts debut outlet is a wholesale-only operation that will sell mainly to vegetable vendors, hospitals, hotels and restaurants. The Amritsar outlet wont even carry the Wal-Mart brand. The company has named its Indian outlets Best Price Modern Wholesale.        
	Industry analysts expect Wal-Mart, known for squeezing efficiencies out of suppliers and supply chains, to have an impact on Indias $375-billion retail market, which is expected to double by 2015.        
	Wal-Marts Indian venture has been delayed because of fierce opposition from small traders and the Left parties. In the elections this year, the Congress had a clean sweep, but the Left suffered major losses, effectively robbing it of the power to influence the new government.        
	With the Left out of the way, industry is optimistic about the opening up of multi-brand retail to foreign direct investment.        
	However, analysts said, many within the Congress are not in favour of the idea.         
	The new government should look at opening up retail by bringing in foreign direct investment, said Rajan Bharti Mittal, vice-chairman of Bharti Enterprises.         
	Foreign multi-brand retailers such as Metro AG, Tesco and Marks amp; Spencer are currently limited to wholesale and licence and franchise operations in India.        
	Commerce minister Kamal Nath had earlier said that FDI in multi-brand retail would not be allowed for the time being.         
	In 2006, the government had allowed 51 per cent FDI in single-brand retail, despite stiff opposition from the Left.         
	Industry players said the new government could allow 100 per cent FDI in single-brand and partial FDI in multi-brand retail.        
	Organised retail, which was expected to touch 16 per cent by 2012, comprises 5 per cent of the total retail business in India.         
	However, crippled by a global slowdown, the sector is estimated to grow 10.4 per cent by 2012, said a report recently released by KPMG.        
	Funding is the biggest issue for us. We are borrowing at 14-15 per cent and this high cost of borrowing has forced us to keep our expansion plans on hold, said Ambeek Khemka, president, Vishal Retail.

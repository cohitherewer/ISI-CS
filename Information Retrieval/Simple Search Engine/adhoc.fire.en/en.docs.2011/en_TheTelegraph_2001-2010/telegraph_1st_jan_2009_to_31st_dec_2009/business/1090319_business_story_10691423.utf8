                                                                                                               Search starts for CPT chief
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Calcutta, March 18: The shipping ministry has sought applications for the post of the chairman of the Calcutta Port Trust (CPT).        
	The tenure of present chairman Anup K. Chanda is going to end in June, when he will complete seven years.        
	Officers belonging to the All India Services at the joint or additional secretary level with an experience of 16 years are eligible. The CPT is an autonomous body under the Union ministry of shipping.        
	The last date for sending applications is April 25.        
	The change at the CPT comes at a time when the port is facing a stiff challenge to maintain navigability of the Haldia docks. Besides, the new chairman will have to maintain good relations with the Bengal government.         
	The CPT and the state government were at loggerheads regarding issues such as the Kulpi Port clearance.        
	Usually, the chairman is from the state cadre, allowing the Bengal government to have a say. This is not the case this time.

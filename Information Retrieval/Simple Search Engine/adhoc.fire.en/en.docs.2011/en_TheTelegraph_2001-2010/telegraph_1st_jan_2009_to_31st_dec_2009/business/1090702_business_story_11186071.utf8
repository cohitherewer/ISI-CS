The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Mamata prefers puris to garib raths
                                                                                                               Mamata prefers puris to garib raths
          JAYANTA ROY CHOWDHURY                          Railway minister Mamata Banerjee in New Delhi on Wednesday. (PTI)                                  
	New Delhi, July 1: Mamata Banerjee is playing true to form.        
	The feisty railway minister  who has carefully crafted a pro-poor image  plans to introduce garib meals at Rs 10 a packet at 700 railway stations and offer the poor a Rs 20 monthly pass on passenger trains.        
	The garib meals, which will be prepared by the Indian Railway Catering and Tourism Corporation, will consist of 10 puris or luchis with vegetables and a sweet.        
	But Banerjee has no plans to roll out any more garib raths  a concept that was conceived by her predecessor Lalu Prasad who rolled out almost a dozen of these trains.        
	Didi does, however, plan to introduce a series of non-air-conditioned superfast trains that will run close to the speed of Rajdhani trains that clock 80km an hour on an average.         
	Banerjee has decided to jettison the garib rath concept because the middle-class people were using them and not the poor. The garib raths had a fare structure that made them costlier than the sleeper class on other superfast trains.         
	The poor, surveys indicated, want even cheaper trains which travel at Rajdhani speeds.        
	At least one of these poor mans Rajdhanis will ply on the Delhi-Calcutta route that Mamata and her Trinamul Congress ministers have been traversing every week since they won an unprecedented 19 seats in the general elections held recently.         
	Didi will also gift her hometown a circular rail link to the Calcutta airport. Her party colleague, minister of state for urban development Saugata Ray, is planning to bring another train project to Calcutta: a Rs 4,800-crore metro linking Salt Lake in the east to Howrah in the west, via an underwater chunnel.         
	From Salt Lake, the new metro project will have an overground rail line till Phoolbagan from where it will enter an underground/underwater tunnel. It will traverse under the Writers Buildings and cross the Hooghly river linking Howrah railway station in Calcuttas industrial suburb.        
	The project has been cleared. We will now be talking to local MPs and MLAs so that a proper rehabilitation package can be worked out, said Ray. To be funded by the Japan Investment Corporation, it will be separate from the Calcutta Metro and will not find mention in the rail budget.        
	However, Mamatas railway ministry will help with technical consultancy for the project. The chunnel will cross the Hooghly river 32 metres below water level, covering a stretch of 900 metres under the waterbed on the way to the terminal station at Howrah Maidan.        
	The railway budget will not increase fares for the aam admi even though railwaymen have discovered that the fiscal situation isnt as rosy as had been painted by Lalu Prasad. Sources said Lalu Prasads claim that the railways had reserves of Rs 90,000 crore was just on paper.

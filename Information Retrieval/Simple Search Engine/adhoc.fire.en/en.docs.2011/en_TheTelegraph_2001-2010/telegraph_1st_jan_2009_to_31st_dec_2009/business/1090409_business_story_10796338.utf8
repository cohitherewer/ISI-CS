          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, April 8: NTPC is planning to acquire coal blocks in Indonesia and Mozambique later this year to raise its generation capacity by 22,430MW in three years.        
	We are planning to acquire four blocks in Indonesia and two in Mozambique by the end of this year. Coal from these blocks will help us raise our capacity by 22,430MW by the end of the XIth Plan (2007-12), R.S. Sharma, CMD of NTPC, said.        
	He said the company would require 225 million tonnes by 2012. It would get only 195mt from Coal India Ltd (CIL) and its subsidiaries. NTPC plans to produce 15mt captively and import 15mt.        
	The company, which has entered into a joint venture with Rashtriya Ispat Nigam, SAIL, NMDC and the CIL to buy coking coal and thermal coal, is also exploring opportunities in Australia, Mozambique, Indonesia and Canada.        
	NTPCs installed capacity, including that of the joint ventures, stood at 30,144MW. Its capacity at the end of 2008-09 was 29,394MW.        
	Generation capacity may increase to 50,000MW by 2012 and 75,000MW by 2017.         
	This year, we will add about 3,300MW to our capacity. About 2,000MW of this will be commercially available, Sharma said. The company reported a 5.6 per cent rise in net profit for 2008-09 at Rs 7,827 crore against Rs 7,415 crore a year ago.         
	Net sales rose to Rs 42,182 crore from Rs 36,946 crore, an increase of about 14 per cent.

                                                                                                               Webel chief quits 
          SOUNAK MITRA                           Datta: Early exit                                  
	Calcutta, Jan. 6: Webel managing director Debanjan Datta has resigned before the end of his tenure.        
	Speculation was rife that Datta  who is also the chief executive officer of the Bengal governments electronics and IT promotion arm  had informed the government of his reluctance to serve his full term.         
	Dattas resignation has been accepted at the board meeting yesterday, a government source said.         
	When contacted by The Telegraph, Datta said, The board has accepted my resignation and I will be officially released from Webel services on January 31. Under normal circumstances, Dattas tenure would have ended on March 31 if his contract was not renewed. He joined the company in April 2006.        
	Webel has placed advertisements in leading newspapers today seeking applications for the post.        
	There is nothing wrong between me and the state government. I am quitting since I have some other plans, Datta said.         
	He, however, refused to comment on his future activities. Sources said he might start his own venture.        
	Before joining as MD of Webel, Datta was the IT head at Crompton Greaves and had also worked at UTI and Exide.        
	Dattas predecessor S.K. Mitra had quit Webel in April 2005 to join a private firm. Since his exit, the post of MD lay vacant for almost a year. A series of IAS officers had temporarily taken charge of Webel after Mitra left.

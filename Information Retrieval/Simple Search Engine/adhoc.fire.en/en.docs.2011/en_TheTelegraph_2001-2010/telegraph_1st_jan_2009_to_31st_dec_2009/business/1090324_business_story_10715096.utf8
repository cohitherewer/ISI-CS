The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Satyam picks six suitors for second phase
                                                                                                               Satyam picks six suitors for second phase
          OUR BUREAU AMP; AGENCIES                          In search of order                                  
	Mumbai, March 23: The board of Satyam Computer has short-listed Larsen amp; Toubro (L amp;T), B.K. Modis Spice Corp and Tech Mahindra among six bidders who will move to the next stage of the bidding process in the race for acquiring the Hyderabad-based technology company.         
	Unconfirmed reports said Hewlett-Packard was on the list as well.        
	These bidders will now have access to financial data, business information and legal diligence on Satyam. This information will help them determine how much each of them are willing to stump up for the 51 per cent stake in Satyam.        
	Spice, Tech Mahindra and L amp;T declined to comment on the development.        
	There was speculation that some of the private equity players were also on the short list but it was not known which ones made the grade.        
	A senior Spice official told a news agency that the company had received an e-mail from the Satyam board informing it that it was on the list.        
	The Spice board is currently taking stock of the situation. The Spice official added that the company wanted Satyam to share details of the CBI investigations so far into the Rs 7,100-crore fraud.        
	Meanwhile, the United Nations has decided against having any dealings with Satyam, a UN spokesperson said today. The current contracts with various agencies are being wrapped up, he said.        
	Jobs on hold        
	Satyam has deferred the joining dates of freshers, citing the global economic slowdown and the turn of events in the firm, while stopping short of asking them to look for jobs elsewhere.         
	Accordingly, it has been decided to defer the joining dates for the campus hires, until further intimation. We expect and recognise that this will cause a disruption in your plans and do sincerely regret the inconvenience caused, it said.

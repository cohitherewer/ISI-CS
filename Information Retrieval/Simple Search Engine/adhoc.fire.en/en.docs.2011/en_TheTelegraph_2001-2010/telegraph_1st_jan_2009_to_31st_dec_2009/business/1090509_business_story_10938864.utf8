                                                                                                               Mallya-Diageo talks on
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Mumbai, May 8: The Vijay Mallya-controlled UB group is still engaged in talks with Diageo Plc, the worlds largest alcoholic drinks group, to sell a stake in flagship United Spirits Ltd (USL).        
	International media reports on Friday indicated that Diageo was not certain of the outcome of the deal and the two potential partners were unable to find a structure that was acceptable to both.        
	However, in a statement, UB group chairman Vijay Mallya said, Talks are very much on. There are structuring issues due to anti- trust or monopoly problems which lawyers are addressing.        
	The anti-trust issues Mallya is referring to revolve around Diageos stature as the world leader in this business, said sources.        
	Diageo executives have been quoted as saying that though the two companies have been in discussions, it does not mean that the talks will result in a transaction. The executives have also said that they are confident that the worlds largest drinks company will continue to grow in India even if the alliance with United Spirits does not materialise.        
	Talks between United Spirits and Diageo began last year. Initially, Mallya was keen to offer a 14.9 per cent stake to Diageo.         
	However, the latter was clear that it wanted equal say as Mallya in USL, and a clear path to a majority.        
	In February, Mallya conceded that he was open to offloading around 36 per cent  that is Mallyas holding in USL  to Diageo.        
	Diageo operates in India through a subsidiary that sells brands like Smirnoff vodka and Black Label whisky. United Spirits is the worlds third largest spirits company by volume.

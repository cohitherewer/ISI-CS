	Calcutta, Nov. 20: A consortium of Srei and India Power Corporation Ltd today emerged as the highest bidder for a majority stake in DPSC Ltd after a nerve-racking 16 rounds of bid battle with Descon Ltd.        
	The Srei and India Power combine will pay Rs 710 per share, valuing the stake at Rs 171.85 crore.         
	Public sector Andrew Yule and two state-run insurance companies  the Life Insurance Corporation and United India Insurance Co Ltd  had put their 57.17 per cent in DPSC, formerly Dishergarh Power Supply Corp, on the block.         
	Descon, the largest shareholder of DPSC, with a 32.31 per cent holding, bowed out after making an offer of Rs 705 a share.        
	Kallol Dutta, chairman and managing director of Andrew Yule, expressed happiness over the completion of the process.        
	It has been a two-year-long journey. We had to overcome many legal hurdles. But finally it is over and our board will recommend the name of the successful bidder to our ministry for approval, he said.        
	The ministry of heavy industries, the administrative ministry of Andrew Yule, will have to approve the deal, provided there are no further legal challenges.        
	After a ministry ratification, a share purchase agreement would be signed with Srei-India Power who would have to make an open offer for another 20 per cent.        
	India Power and one of its promoters Environ Energy already hold a 5.84 per cent stake in DPSC.        
	The bidding began at 12 noon with four in the fray  CESC, Srei-India Power, Descon and Patton. JSW Energy protested against the last minute changes in the terms and did not participate.        
	The sealed tenders were opened under the aegis of a court-appointed advocate at 2pm, and Srei emerged the highest bidder at Rs 350.         
	Patton was disqualified as it did not provide a bank guarantee.        
	CESC, Descon and Srei then engaged in nine rounds of frantic bidding, when the city power utility quit after a quote of Rs 625.         
	Descon and Srei continued their bidding up to the 16th round. The final announcement was made by the Andrew Yule chairman at 5pm.         
	Jyoti Poddar, director of India Power, was elated. This is a great moment for us. We plan to take DPSC to greater heights, he said.        
	India Power is building a 400 mega watt (MW) power plant in Haldia. It plans to sell part of the power through DPSCs network.        
	DPSC produces 40 mega watt at Dishergarh in Burdwan and sells around 150 mega watt over a 640-square-kilometre area in Burdwan.        
	Debi Prasad Patra, managing director of India Power, said his company would try to implement DPSCs 500 mega watt expansion plan.        
	Industry observers are eagerly awaiting what Descon will do with its stake. Descon has pledged its entire 32 per cent in DPSC with JSW Energy, while taking a loan of Rs 6 crore.         
	On the National Stock Exchange today, DPSC gained Rs 74.80, or 12.3 per cent, to close at Rs 682.

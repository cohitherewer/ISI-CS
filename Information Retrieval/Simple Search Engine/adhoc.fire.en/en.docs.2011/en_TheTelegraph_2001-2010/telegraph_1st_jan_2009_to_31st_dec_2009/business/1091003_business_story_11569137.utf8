	New Delhi, Oct. 2: State-run Air India will stick to its stand that all employees accept a lower productivity incentive pay-out despite the five-day strike by executive pilots that ended earlier this week.        
	The executive pilots went on a wildcat strike protesting the pay cut.        
	The Air Indias firm stand on lower productivity incentive pay-out stems from that fact that unless it comes up with a workable turnaround plan it will be difficult for the the national carrier to get a Rs Rs 2,000-crore equity infusion from the government.        
	Officials say cuts in productivity linked incentives (PLIs) could help it save up to Rs1,000 crore a year.         
	Top officials said pilots, engineers and other staff would be asked to accept deep cuts in PLIs.         
	Initially, the management planned to cut up to 70 per cent of the PLIs for the highest paid pilots and engineers. However, now AI plans to insist on cuts of up to 45 per cent.         
	An earlier ruling that employees earning up to Rs 10,000 in incentives would not face any cut would continue.        
	The ministry and the airlines management feel route restructuring, optimisation of fleet, leasing out of property and closure of unviable stations will generate internal resources.        
	The plan envisages savings of Rs 1,800 crore through cost-cutting measures of which incentive cuts can contribute the most, officials said. Another Rs 3,000 crore is expected to be generated through internal accruals over the next six months.        
	Air India, which has accumulated losses of Rs 7,200 crore, is also seeking a government guarantee to retire high-cost debts which make up Rs 11,000 crore of its Rs 16,000-crore debt portfolio and replace it with cheaper credit. However, the finance ministry has ruled that neither the equity infusion nor the government guarantee will be forthcoming unless a workable turnaround plan is submitted.         
	Executive pilots of Air India called off their five-day strike earlier this week after the government stalled pay cuts the airline had ordered last week.        
	A committee headed by the cabinet secretary had demanded that Air India should come up with a workable plan before the government gave it loan guarantee and infused fresh capital.        
	The airline started bleeding after an economic slowdown last year saw the aviation industry drawing fewer passengers.         
	The airlines problems were compounded because it took on costly loans to fund an ambitious fleet expansion plan.

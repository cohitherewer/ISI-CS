          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Aug. 4: Steel Authority of India Ltd and Tata Steel today said they had hiked the prices of flat products.         
	SAIL, however, has slashed the price of its long products, and Tata Steel is expected to follow suit.         
	Analysts said the price rise by the steel duo came on the back of a recovery in the economy and a sharp rise in demand.         
	Consumer durables and automobile industries consume flat steel products, while long steel is used mainly in construction.        
	We have increased the prices of flat steel products, excluding sheets and mill plates, in the range of Rs 800-1,000 a tonne and cut long steel prices by Rs 500-2,000 per tonne, mainly due to the monsoon season when constructions come down, a SAIL spokesperson said. A Tata Steel spokesperson said the company hiked the spot prices of flat products in select markets by Rs 500-1,000 a tonne.

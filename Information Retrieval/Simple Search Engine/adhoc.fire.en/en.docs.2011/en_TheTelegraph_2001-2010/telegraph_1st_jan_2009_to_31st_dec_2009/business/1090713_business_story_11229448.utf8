The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Bad loan norms set to change
                                                                                                               Bad loan norms set to change
          JAYATI GHOSE                          Rule tweak                                  
	New Delhi, July 12: The Reserve Bank of India is planning to change the norms that classify bad loans. If a borrower fails to make payments on a particular loan taken from a bank, all other credit will not be classified as bad or non-performing as long as the buyer makes regular payments on those loans.        
	At present, if a borrower defaults on any loan, all other loans taken are treated as bad assets. For instance, if an individual borrower defaults on his credit card bills, the bank will classify all loans (personal, home and others) taken by the person as non-performing assets.        
	The change in bad asset classification will prevent the degradation of a borrowers credit rating and enable him to get additional loans at competitive interest rates, said industry experts. Classifying only particular loans, where the borrower has made a default in payment, as bad asset will help him get credit in the future, said Abizer Diwanji, financial analyst with consultancy firm KPMG.        
	Current norms undermine a borrowers ability to obtain loans in the future from other financial institutions as his credit history gets a negative rating because of a default, he said.         
	Banks and financial lenders are also in favour of modifying the classification as it encourages retail lending and reduces the amount of money banks need to keep aside to cover loan losses.        
	Given that the economy is experiencing a slowdown, it will be apt if the RBI changed bad loan classification norms to spur demand in retail, said a senior public sector banker.        
	Once a loan is classified as a bad account, a bank has to set aside 10 per cent of the outstanding loan as a provision for sub-standard assets, at least 20 per cent for doubtful assets and 100 per cent for loan accounts that have turned into a loss.        
	The provisioning hits the bottomline of the bank and increases the ratio of bad loans in the accounting books, affecting its overall performance and image.

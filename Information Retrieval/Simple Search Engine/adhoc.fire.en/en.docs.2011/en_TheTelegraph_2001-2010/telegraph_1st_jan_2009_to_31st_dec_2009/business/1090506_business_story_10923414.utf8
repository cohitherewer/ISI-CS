The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Obama plan fails to trigger panic
                                                                                                               Obama plan fails to trigger panic
  - India sees bigger loss for US firms
          OUR BUREAU                                            
	May 5: President Barack Obamas sweeping tax reform plan that seeks to remove incentives given to US corporations that invest abroad has left corporate India  especially the information technology giants  unperturbed.  
	Obama had sparked a buzz on Monday by bashing Bangalore  the outsourcing hub  once again. He said the tax code in the US was so badly skewed that it allowed US corporations to pay lower taxes if you create a job in Bangalore, India, than if you create one in Buffalo, New York.         
	The overriding view is that the Obama tax plan will hit US firms harder than the Indian outsourcing industry. Most large American companies have more than 50 per cent of their revenues coming from markets outside the US and would be affected by the proposed tax reforms if implemented, said the National Association of Software and Service Companies (Nasscom).        
	However, American corporations may be forced to slash jobs at their Indian operations in the long run. If US companies lose business globally, there are bound to be job cuts in India, said Nasscom president Som Mittal.        
	The Obama tax reform plan must be voted in the US Congress before it becomes law. If the legislation is passed and there is no indication that it will muster bipartisan support, all the large American corporations  Coca-Cola Company, General Electric, Procter amp; Gamble and Google  will be affected.        
	The Obama plan envisages a massive crackdown on tax havens besides closing offshore loopholes. It expects to raise $210 billion over 10 years from these proposals.        
	There are three key proposals that seek to remove tax advantages for US firms investing overseas. First, the Obama plan wants to reform deferral rules that offer tax advantages for investing and re-investing abroad.        
	At present, businesses that invest overseas can not only take immediate deductions on their US tax returns for expenses supporting their investments but also defer paying US taxes on the profits they make from those investments. The Obama proposal aims at reforming the rules surrounding deferral so that firms cannot claim deductions on their US tax returns until they pay taxes on their offshore profits.        
	The growth of MNCs historically is because of tax deferrals. It is to be seen how this will impact their global expansion plans. Prima facie, it may discourage them from investing abroad, said Nishith Desai of the eponymous Nishith Desai amp; Associates, a tax consultancy.        
	Two, the proposals are keen to close foreign tax credit loopholes. At present, US businesses that pay foreign taxes on overseas profits claim a credit against their US taxes for the foreign taxes paid. It is suspected that some US businesses use loopholes to artificially inflate these credits.        
	Three, the proposals want to prevent US companies from moving to low-cost research and development centres such as India. The research and experimentation (R amp;E) tax credit, which provides an incentive for businesses to invest in innovation in the US, is set to expire at the end of 2009. The Obama proposals seek to make the R amp;E tax credit permanent to encourage businesses to stay at home.        
	Ficci president Harsh Pati Singhania said in an era of globalisation, taking measures that force companies to restrict their economic activities in one region and not in the other is a retrograde step.

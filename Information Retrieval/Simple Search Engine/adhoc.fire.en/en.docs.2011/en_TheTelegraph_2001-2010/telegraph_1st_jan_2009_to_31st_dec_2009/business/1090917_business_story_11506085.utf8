The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | R-Com numbers to begin with 8
                                                                                                               R-Com numbers to begin with 8
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Sept. 16: Reliance Communications (R-Com) today launched a mobile number series starting with 8 instead of the usual 9.         
	The new series will be available for R-Coms GSM customers, both pre-paid and post-paid.        
	Beginning with Delhi, R-Com will subsequently launch the series in other circles. Existing customers can also get a number under the new series with their present connection.        
	Reliance is unveiling its GSM mobile 8010xxxxxx number series for its Delhi subscribers. The new numbers are available at all Reliance retail outlets, said C.S. Rana, regional head of R-Com.        
	With over 10 million mobile subscribers being added every month and the all-India customer base crossing the 42-million-mark, the current series beginning with 9 is likely to get exhausted by next year.         
	Initially, the department of telecom (DoT) had suggested the use of an 11-digit mobile number instead of the existing 10-digit keeping in mind the long-term demand.         
	However, both the department and the operators were not willing to spend the huge amount required to upgrade the infrastructure to make it compatible with the new series.         
	The DoT then came up with the idea of introducing a number series starting with 8. However, this is only a short-term solution to the problem.

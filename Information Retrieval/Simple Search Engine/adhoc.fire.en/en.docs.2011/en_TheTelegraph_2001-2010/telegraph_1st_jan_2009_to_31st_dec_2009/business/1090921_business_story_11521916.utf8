                                                                                                               Jewellery makers see earnings lustre
          A STAFF REPORTER                                            
	Calcutta, Sept. 20: Branded jewellery makers hope to achieve a 20 per cent growth in earnings during the festive season, marked by a spike in gold prices.        
	We hope to grow 20 per cent in value terms this season, said Sandeep Kulhalli, vice-president (retail and marketing) of Tanishq. The company recently launched a contest on the occasion of the Pujas in the eastern region.         
	There are signs of a revival and our mood is that of cautious optimism, Kulhalli added.        
	According to the Gitanjali group, the rise in gold prices will not affect sales.         
	We operate primarily in the diamond jewellery segment and our pricing is MRP-based. Our prices dont fluctuate and we dont expect to be affected by the rise in gold prices, R.K. Menon, CEO of DDamas, said. DDamas is a group company of Gitanjali.         
	Another player, Orra, expects a positive sentiment in the market. August sales were much better and we are anticipating a same-store growth of 30-35 per cent this festival season, the company said.        
	We are not sure about the volume, but the high gold prices will help us to have a good growth in value, Kulhalli said.        
	According to a market survey, Indian households are estimated to have 20,000 tonnes of gold, mainly in the form of jewellery, which they sell in case of a price surge.        
	On Friday, on the Multi-Commodity Exchange (MCX), the most-traded October gold contract was up 0.02 per cent to Rs 15,855 per 10 gram at 11:47 a.m. Open interest for October gold on the MCX was 15,653 lots, down from 15,754 a day earlier. Volume on Thursday was 37.87 kg.        
	Gold prices in the Asian and European markets steadied on Friday as light buying emerged on dips towards $1,000 per ounce. On Thursday, gold declined $12 after touching an 18-month high.         
	Bullion analysts in India said prices might be in the range of Rs 15,800-16,000 per 10gm.

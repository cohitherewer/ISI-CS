	New Delhi, Sept. 7: India and Switzerland will hold talks in December on the possibility of changing their double taxation avoidance treaty to allow access to information on black money held by Indians in Swiss banks.        
	Finance ministry officials are in talks with their counterparts in about 78 countries  including Mauritius, Brazil, Canada, Italy, the UK, the US and the UAE  on amending tax treaties and collecting information about slush funds.         
	Information will be on specific cases and not for all bank accounts, according to the norms of the Organisation of Economic Co-operation and Development.        
	Besides, the information can be used to collect taxes but cannot be given out publicly.         
	Luxembourg, one the main countries where Indians were parking black money, had recently signed a similar deal.         
	However, India still does not have such tax treaties with several Channel Islands  a group of islands on the English Channel  and South American countries.        
	Finance minister Pranab Mukherjee is believed to have made a strong pitch for more transparent rules on tax havens at last weeks G20 meeting of finance ministers in London. Earlier, the BJP made an issue of India not being able to take advantage of the OECD norms.        
	However, officials say the government is taking a low-key approach and will go public only after securing some concrete amendments in the tax treaties.        
	A 2006 report of the Swiss Banking Association claimed that Indians were among the biggest depositors of black money in banks located in Switzerland. Indias black money abroad is believed to be more than its foreign exchange reserves, according to some calculations. A study conducted three years ago by Global Financial Integrity said $27.3 billion in black money was sucked out of India every year.         
	Seven years ago, after 9/11, the G20 had cracked down on hawala. India, which in the past had not been too enthusiastic in the hunt for hawala operators, had agreed to rein in the well entrenched parallel banking system. Intelligence agencies had found hard proof on the hawala being used by Kashmiri separatists and the Mumbai underworld.

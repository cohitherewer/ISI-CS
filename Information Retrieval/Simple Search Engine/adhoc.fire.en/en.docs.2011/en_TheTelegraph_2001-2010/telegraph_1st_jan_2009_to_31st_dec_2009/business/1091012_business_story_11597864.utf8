The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Walk past the crisis
                                                                                                               Walk past the crisis
        Dhirendra Kumar does a mood check as the debate continues on whether its finally time to say goodbye to recession blues                                      
	The last couple of years have seen savers being worried about things that earlier used to bother only investors, and with good reason too.         
	By savers, I mean those who park money with banks, insurance schemes, mutual funds and other such types of assets that give an assured return. Investors, on the other hand, are people who trade in investments. Typically, savers just salt away their money and dip into it only when needed; investors buy and sell based on their expectations from the markets.        
	However, the traumatic chain of events witnessed by the world economy last year has made savers as much concerned about the market trends as investors. This is quite understandable.         
	A large proportion of savings now tend to be in assets that are linked to the equity markets. Moreover, the panic generated in 2008 has made many savers acutely aware of the events in the investment markets and the broader global economy.        
	Calmed nerves         
	At this point of time, the mood across markets around the world is one of optimism. The fact that the mood has settled down is significant and is more telling than bare numbers.         
	Till a quarter or so ago, there was an uncertainty among investors. They knew the story, they could see the direction in which the markets were going and they could understand the logic, but they hadnt yet forgotten the horrors of 2008.         
	Like the survivors of some great disaster, they couldnt quite believe that it was actually over. However, that was then. Since then, Ive noticed a fundamental change in the way investors and investment managers are thinking.         
	They can see the ups and downs but have begun to believe that the rough patches are part of a routine drill that they are always aware of.        
	Two sides of a coin        
	Is this shift in perception justified? Perhaps yes, but there are some strong opposing arguments. Lets see what the arguments on both sides are.        
	The optimistic view: Its true that the crisis was a severe one, but a lot was done to resolve it and all of it succeeded. Economic growth is back across the world. Moreover, India and other emerging markets have proven to be resilient to the worst impact.        
	From an investors perspective, the downturn wasnt that bad after all. As the economic outlook deteriorated, equity prices plunged. However, the bad news was over-discounted.         
	Corporate growth and profit numbers were never as bad as everyone feared they would be. Companies, in fact, have recovered quite sharply. The global economic decline was not a bottomless phenomenon as the doomsayers would have had us believe.        
	From here on, stock prices may run ahead of themselves; they may lag a bit, but thats a normal oscillation around the mean. It is qualitatively different from what we were afraid of in 2008. Perhaps the most important factor was the strong action taken by governments around the world to arrest the crisis. It proved that governments are capable of quick and decisive actions. When the situation threatens to spiral out of control, theres someone to bring it back under control.        
	Now lets see the darker part of the story from folks who think that the worse may still be ahead: The root cause of the crisis was a huge liquidity glut which encouraged or even necessitated a massive ignoring of risk and inflation of asset prices.         
	Not only has this not been solved, huge chunks of stimulus may actually have made it worse. Be it the equity or the commodity markets or real estate, one can see the same asset price inflation that is driven by excess liquidity without much regard to fundamentals. Moreover, none of the reforms that could correct institutional misbehaviour in the western world have been implemented.         
	Bankers and other financial institutions have got away with the murder. Earlier, they could only have hoped that they were too big for governments to allow them to fail. Now, they have first-hand evidence that no matter how deep a hole they dig, government will print enough money to fill it for them.         
	Essentially, all the stimulus that has been created around the world will have to be paid back. Broadly speaking, one could be heading for a similar cycle as earlier, and it could eventually be even worse than last time.        
	Where do you stand?        
	These are the two sides to the debate and the logic for both is impeccable. Which one will appeal to you more depends on the mood you are in and that probably depends more on what kind of a person you are and how the downturn has affected you personally. The important thing is to appreciate that either view may actually be right.        
	But isnt that a problem for the ordinary saver? Not really, as long as he realises that none of this actually has much bearing on how he should save.         
	Through the panic and collapse of 2008 and the surge of 2009, one thing became clear. This may have been the worst economic crisis the world has seen for a long time, but those who stuck to the basic tenets of savings could well have slept through it. All that one needed to do was to make sure that money required in the short-term was in bank deposits and other safe assets. Second, long-term investments in equity-backed mutual funds should have been gradual over a long period.         
	Those whose investment strategy conformed to these simple principles came out unhurt through 2008-09, and will be fine in the future regardless of which of the above two scenarios is closer to the truth.

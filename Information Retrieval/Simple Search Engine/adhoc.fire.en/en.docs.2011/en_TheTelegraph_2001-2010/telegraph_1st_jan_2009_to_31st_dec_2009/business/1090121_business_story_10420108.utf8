The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Sops in place to charge up power
                                                                                                               Sops in place to charge up power
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Sigh of relief                                  
	New Delhi, Jan. 20: The apex power regulator has hiked the rate of return on equity for projects to 15.5 per cent from 14.         
	However, by giving the developers tax incentives, the regulator expects the final tariff to remain the same.        
	The rate of return on equity has been increased from 14 to 15.5 per cent. However, several measures have been taken so that the tariff to end consumers remains unchanged, Pramod Deo, chairman of the Central Electricity Regulatory Commission, said.        
	He said the change in the guidelines was intended to attract investment, which slipped following the recession.         
	The investment shortfall in the Eleventh Five Year Plan (2007-12)  the capacity addition target is 78,577MW  is estimated at Rs 4,51,000 crore by officials in the power ministry.        
	For the timely completion of projects, the return will be higher by another 0.5 per cent.        
	The new returns for generation and transmission projects are for five years (2009-2014).         
	These regulations have been finalised after detailed consultation with the stakeholders and will also be the guiding principles for the State Electricity Regulatory Commissions, Deo said.        
	Firms will have to pay the income tax on unscheduled incomes, incentive earning and efficiency gains from the projects. Earlier, the consumer used to share this burden.        
	While doing away with advances against depreciation, the commission has also reworked the rates to take care of the repayment of debt obligations on new projects.         
	However, once the initial period of 12 years is over, remaining depreciation will be spread over the rest of the project period.        
	The regulator said the new tariff regulations would not affect the mega power projects and others where tariff based bidding had taken place.        
	Tariffs for renewable energy will be worked out in the next six months.

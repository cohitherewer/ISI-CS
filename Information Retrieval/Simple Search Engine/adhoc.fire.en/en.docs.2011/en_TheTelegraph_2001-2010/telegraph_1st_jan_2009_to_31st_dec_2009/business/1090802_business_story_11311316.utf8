The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Bharti, MTN to set new deal deadline
                                                                                                               Bharti, MTN to set new deal deadline
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                          LONG-DRAWN AFFAIR                                  
	New Delhi, Aug. 1: The merger talks between Bharti Airtel and South Africas MTN are likely to be extended till August-end. Both the companies will make an official announcement on the revised deadline on Monday.        
	The telecom majors could not come to any conclusion in their exclusivity talks, held between May 25 and July 31, for a possible share-swap deal between the two.         
	Azmi Mikati, chief executive of the M1 Group  one of the largest shareholders in MTN, had earlier said talks would most probably be extended till August-end as the deal was complex and involved multiple jurisdictions.        
	Lebanons Mikati family controls about 10 per cent of MTN through the M1 Group. Mikati is also a non-executive member on the MTN board.        
	Analysts said it was unlikely that the firms would call off the talks because both had applied for funding to meet the financial obligations arising out of the merger and would be reluctant to pay the penalty charges in case the deal failed to take shape.        
	The companies are negotiating for the second time. I doubt they will abandon the deal altogether but the likelihood of an extension is most probable, said Kunal Bajaj, a director at BDA Connect, a corporate advisory firm.        
	Bharti has reportedly held talks with banks, including Standard Chartered, JPMorgan, ABN Amro, Deutsche Bank, Barclays and the State Bank of India, to raise about $4 billion.         
	MTN has held talks with a group of lenders to secure a $3.5-billion syndicated loan.        
	The merger will see both Bharti and MTN offering equity stakes and cash to each other.         
	Bharti will have to make a net cash payment of around $4 billion to acquire a 49 per cent stake in MTN, which, in turn, will get a 36 per cent economic interest in the Indian firm.        
	Sources said many MTN shareholders complained that the price was not high enough. So, the deal may have to be sweetened to appease them.        
	To a shareholder, money matters. Since Bharti needs the approval of 75 per cent of MTN shareholders, it may need to raise the cash per share ratio, the sources said.        
	Bharti and MTN revived talks to create a large telecom group in the emerging markets a year after previous efforts broke down over who would control the merged entity.        
	The merger will form a telecom firm covering Asia, West Asia and Africa with a combined revenue of more than $20 billion and 200 million customers.

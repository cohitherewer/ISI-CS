The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Descon brass incur shareholder wrath 
                                                                                                               Descon brass incur shareholder wrath 
          SAMBIT SAHA                                            
	Calcutta, March 1: The minority shareholders of Descon Ltd, a city-based software firm, have moved the Company Law Board (CLB) against the management. They have accused the management of financial wrongdoings and siphoning funds.        
	The development comes at a time when Descon is locked in a legal battle with its parent, public sector Andrew Yule, over the control of DPSC Ltd, which is up for disinvestment.         
	In their petition before the CLB, more than 100 shareholders of Descon alleged that a shareholder trust had been wrongfully created by the existing management.         
	The financial dealings with regard to some subsidiaries and properties have also come under a scanner.         
	Earlier this month, the CLB, in an interim order, had asked the management to refrain from transferring the fixed assets of the company as well as a flat in Jodhpur Park.         
	The move by the minority shareholders assumes significance as the case between Andrew Yule and Descon will be taken up at Calcutta High Court next week.         
	Descon, which holds a majority 32.31 per cent stake in power generator and distributor DPSC, is opposed to Andrew Yules disinvestment plans.        
	Sundaresan Radhakrishnan, managing director of both Descon and DPSC Ltd (formerly Dishergarh Power Supply Corporation), said, I think some vested interests who want to malign the company have taken the initiative. Most of the shareholders who have moved the CLB are employees of Yule against whom we are fighting the case over DPSC, Radhakrishnan told The Telegraph.        
	Sources in the Descon management said the arguments and facts presented before the CLB were incorrect.         
	According to the petition, a Descon Shareholders Trust, which holds 48 per cent in Descon and which has Radhakrishnan as managing trustee, has been wrongfully created. The petitioners claimed a trust could not own any share on its own name. They also alleged that the trust did not feature in the filings with the Registrar of Companies.         
	Descon sources said the trust held only 24 per cent in the company. It also cannot be called a trust in the strictest sense of law.         
	Some shareholders gave this body the power of attorney in terms of their voting rights. But they continue to be individual shareholders in the books of Descon. The dividend, if any, goes directly to them and not to the trust, the sources said.         
	Moreover, three venture capital firms  two from UK and one from Singapore  had invested Rs 23.5 crore in Descon in August 2008 by picking up a 49 per cent stake.

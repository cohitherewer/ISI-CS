                                                                                                               Recipe to boost trade with Bangla
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, July 19: Industry has sought lower tariffs, rail link for cross-border movement of containers and an increase in market access to help double India-Bangladesh trade by 2011.        
	Trade with Bangladesh rose to $1.85 billion in 2006-07 from $1 billion in 2001-02.         
	In 2007-08, bilateral trade stood at $3.17 billion, an increase of 71 per cent over the previous year, on the back of a 79.4 per cent rise in Indias exports.         
	According to estimates, exports to Bangladesh are over $3 billion and imports from that country are $100 million.        
	A Ficci report said the two countries should reduce tariffs, discourage unofficial trade and enter into a free-trade agreement.        
	An increase in market access, an agreement on rail link and a simplification of pre-shipment inspection system will also strengthen trade ties between the two countries.        
	A business delegation led by Ficci is set to visit Bangladesh this week.         
	The visit comes amid renewed calls by Bangladesh to take steps to provide a boost to trade between the two countries.         
	According to analysts, the greater need is to detect those areas where both the countries can create a conducive environment and remove mistrust.         
	Indian firms have expressed the need for a bilateral transport agreement to help to address the problem of trans-shipment of goods at border points.

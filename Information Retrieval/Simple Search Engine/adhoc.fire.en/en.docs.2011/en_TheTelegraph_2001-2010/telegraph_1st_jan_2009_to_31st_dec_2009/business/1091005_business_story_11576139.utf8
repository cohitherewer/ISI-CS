The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | SAIL give- amp;-take on Chiria mines
                                                                                                               SAIL give- amp;-take on Chiria mines

	New Delhi, Oct. 4: The Centre is hopeful that the Jharkhand government will renew the Chiria mining lease in favour of Steel Authority of India Ltd (SAIL) following the massive investment lined up by the company for the state.         
	The steel PSU will invest up to Rs 60,000 crore to ramp up capacity at its Bokaro unit and set up a plant near Manoharpur.         
	A meeting between Jharkhands chief secretary and the Union secretaries for steel and mines will be held on Monday to resolve the row over lease renewal.         
	SAIL chairman S.K. Roongta has also been asked to attend the meeting. Chiria has Asias largest reserves of iron ore.        
	Top officials said SAIL planned to expand Bokaros capacity from 3.8 million tonnes (mt) to 6.5mt at an estimated investment of Rs 12,000 crore. A 12mt plant near Manoharpur has also been offered to Jharkhand, which can cost up to Rs 48,000 crore.        
	We expect around 40,000 direct and indirect jobs to be created if these two developments take place in Jharkhand. Its a great opportunity and we hope to convince the state government to agree to renew the leases on Ajitaburu and Sukri-Latur in Chiria and Jhilingburu in Gua, said officials.        
	Jharkhand state government officials have been noncommital about extending the lease. After Burnpur-based IISCO was merged with SAIL, the ownership of Chiria and Gua was transferred to the latter.        
	At present, Jharkhand is under Presidents rule. According to central government officials, this is an appropriate time to take forward a deal with SAIL. In the absence of a state government, rival claims by companies such as ArcelorMittal, Ispat and Essar Steel can be easily thwarted.        
	The Jharkhand government had tried to take back part of the mineral-rich mines from SAIL and give them to private steel firms such as ArcelorMittal and Essar Steel, only to be refused by an appelate tribunal.         
	However, local politics, the global downturn and pressure from the central government has turned the tide in favour of SAIL. It now seems likely that SAIL will continue to have access to Chiria, which has about 2 billion tonnes of iron ore reserves.        
	SAIL had earlier announced that it would go ahead with a two-phased, Rs 3,500-crore plan to produce more ore and set up a beneficiation plant in the Naxalite-infested area.         
	The plan envisages expanding mining from a mere 1mt per annum at Dhobil to 7mt in two to three years by tapping new areas within Chiria such as Mclellan and Ajitaburu.        
	Subsequently, output will be raised to 15mt by tapping the remaining leases such as Sukri in this forested zone.        
	SAIL has 11 iron ore mining leases in the state.         
	Apart from Ajitaburu, Sukri-latur and Jhilingburu-I, which are under litigation, the company uses the mines in Kiriburu-Maghataburu, Budhaburu and Dhobil of Chiria and Jhilingburu and Topailor of Gua, which are being extended.        
	Officials said the state would be asked to regularise the leases on these blocks as well as expedite various clearances needed to expand mining in these areas.        
	Public offer plan        
	The government has asked SAIL to give a specific proposal for its proposed public offering. The PSUs board will take up the matter in a meeting later this month.        
	The proposal, once submitted, will be taken up with the finance ministry as the government is likely to divest part of its holding at the time of the public offer, a senior government official said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | RBI bats for dollar
                                                                                                               RBI bats for dollar
                            
	Mumbai, July 11 (Reuters): Reserve Bank of India governor Duvvuri Subbarao has said the dollar will continue to be the global reserve currency for now, amid calls for debates to replace the US unit.        
	At this time Im not sure if there is a currency that can replace the dollar, Subbarao said in the interview with Central Banking Publications, London.        
	In any case, replacing the dollar cant happen by fiat. It has to happen on the strength of that alternative currency, he said in the interview.         
	Subbarao said he had studied the debate for the global currency, the alternatives for it and implications for the global and emerging economies.        
	Countries such as China called for a debate at the G8 summit on proposals for a new global reserve currency to replace the dollar to reflect the shifting balance of power in the globalised economy.        
	Indias foreign secretary had said the country would be willing to discuss the proposal and a key policy adviser had said the countrys currency basket could be diversified.         
	Subbarao said the debate would likely to carry on longer than anticipated before countries reach an agreed view on a minimum acceptable programme.        
	The immediate challenge for the Reserve Bank of India will be to create a stage for a 9 per cent growth amid price and financial stability and the country should focus on increasing infrastructure investment, Subbarao said.

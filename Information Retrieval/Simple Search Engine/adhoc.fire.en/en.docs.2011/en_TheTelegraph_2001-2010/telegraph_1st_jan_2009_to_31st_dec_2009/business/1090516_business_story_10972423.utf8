          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Bijoy Chatterjee in Calcutta on Friday. A Telegraph picture                                  
	Calcutta, May 15: The Bengal government will soon sign a memorandum of agreement with the Centre for the proposed chemical hub at Nayachar-Haldia.        
	Bijoy Chatterjee, Union secretary for chemicals and fertilisers, said the agreement would outline the roles of the state and the central government.         
	We will also fix the timeline for the common infrastructure to be built in each of the chemical hubs (in the country), including Haldia-Nayachar, he said.        
	Besides Nayachar, the Centre has approved petroleum, chemical, petrochemical investment regions (PCPIRs) at Dahej in Gujarat and Visakhapatnam, Andhra Pradesh.        
	A management board will be set up to oversee the development. The Centre will provide viability gap funding for the public-private partnership projects to build infrastructure at Haldia-Nayachar.         
	Chatterjee was speaking on the sidelines of a seminar organised by the Indian Plastic Federation and the Central Institute of Plastic Engineering amp; Technology.        
	Bengal industry secretary Sabyasachi Sen said the first priority for the government would be to build a deep water port.        
	Once the port comes up, investors, including overseas ones, will take interest, he said.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                 
	Calcutta, Nov. 15: Grupo Mexico is set to oust Indias Sterlite from the race for US copper producer Asarco following a favourable court verdict .         
	After the latest verdict in the US, Mexican miner Grupo will buy Asarco for $2.4 billion, unless Sterlite makes an appeal and gets a ruling in its favour.         
	Two successive orders, one from a lower bankruptcy court in Texas in August and the other from a district court yesterday, upheld Grupos restructuring plan to help Asarco to come out of bankruptcy.         
	The case is now in the fifth year of bankruptcy proceedings, US judge Andrew Hanen wrote in a 141-page ruling. The end, barring appeals, is now in sight.         
	Sterlite, a subsidiary of the London Stock Exchange-listed Vedanta Resources PLC, has been battling Grupo Mexico since last year for the control of Asarco.         
	A Sterlite spokesperson said, We are yet to receive a copy of the judgement and will come back to you accordingly. No information was given on whether the company would appeal. Industry observers, however, said an appeal was a strong possibility.         
	Judge Hanen has the final say over whether Grupo Mexicos offer will prevail over Sterlites $2.5-billion bid, which was backed by the Asarco management and its main union, the United Steel Workers.         
	While hearing the case last month, Hanen had indicated that Grupo Mexico and its work force should begin discussions on a new collective wage agreement to avoid labour strife after Asarco exited bankruptcy.         
	Sterlite already had an agreement with the workers union who was against Grupo regaining control of the US firm. Sterlite, owned by NRI billionaire Anil Agarwal, had initially offered $2.6 billion for Asarco but later reduced it to $1.7 billion after global recession sent copper prices tumbling.         
	Grupo Mexico matched that offer and then kept pace with Sterlite, which subsequently raised the offer price several times.         
	The Mexican entity had acquired Asarco in a leveraged buyout in 1999 but lost board control after the company sunk into bankruptcy.         
	Asarco, based in the American state of Tucson, filed for bankruptcy protection in 2005 amidst a strike and more than $1-billion in claims for environment damages.         
	Justice Hanen said: In many ways, the course of this bankruptcy has been a contentious and hard-fought piece of litigation. In other ways, this proceeding can be labelled as one of the most successful bankruptcy proceedings in recent history.         
	If Grupo gets control, it will get a company that is on a recovery path. In its monthly report for August, filed on September 30, Asarco has reported a profit of about $40 million on a revenue of about $100 million, a big jump from Julys $24-million profit on a revenue of $76 million.         
	Since filing for bankruptcy, Asarco has made a profit of about $1.54 billion and earned a revenue of $5.47 billion.         
	It is the third-largest copper producer in the US with stakes in five mines.         
	Last year, judge Hanen himself held Grupo Mexico guilty of defrauding Asarcos creditors. Grupo was found transferring the ownership of Asarcos rich copper assets in Peru to one of its units. The Mexican company has appealed against the verdict.

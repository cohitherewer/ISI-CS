	Calcutta, Dec. 3: ICICI Prudential Life Insurance Company has tied up with India Post to regain its market share.        
	ICICI Prudential Life, which began operations in December 2000, was the No. 1 among all private insurers till a couple of years ago. It has now been overtaken by SBI Life Insurance.         
	Over the April-October period, ICICI Prudential had a market share of 5.54 per cent with a premium income of Rs 2,588.01 crore, down over 33 per cent from Rs 3,870.89 crore in the corresponding period last fiscal.        
	SBI Lifes market share was 6.58 per cent with a 12.56 per cent growth in total premium income to Rs 3,074.20 crore from Rs 2,731.14 crore in April-October 2008.         
	ICICI Prudential has witnessed the biggest fall in premium among all private life insurers, followed by Kotak Life Insurance Company (31.46 per cent) in April-October.         
	According to Anup Rau, senior vice-president and head of sales of ICICI Prudential Life, the tie-up with India Post will give the company a wider reach in rural areas.         
	There are 1,55,204 post offices across India and 90 per cent of them are in rural areas. Sixty nine per cent of the population lives in rural India, accounting for 45 per cent of the countrys total household income, Rau said.         
	ICICI Prudential will find it cheaper to expand to rural areas through India Post.        
	Under the arrangement with India Post, some branches in the different circles will refer their customers willing to buy an insurance or a pension product to ICICI Prudential officials.

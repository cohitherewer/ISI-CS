The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Hiccups for Tata Steel in Vietnam
                                                                                                               Hiccups for Tata Steel in Vietnam
          SAMBIT SAHA                                            
	Calcutta, Aug. 26: Tata Steels greenfield venture in Vietnam is dogged by delays in acquiring land and tying up secure supplies of iron ore.        
	The company, which became the worlds sixth largest steel maker after the buyout of Anglo-Dutch giant Corus, had decided to build a new unit in Vietnam at a cost of $5 billion (Rs 24,450 crore).        
	The first phase of the project  a cold rolling mill plant was scheduled to be ready by the end of 2010. However, the company is yet to acquire the land even as it claimed to have sorted out the problems over iron ore supplies.        
	The entire project, which will have a 4.5-million-tonne steelmaking capacity, is due to be built over 10 years and in three phases. Tata Steel has a 65 per cent stake in the venture while Vietnams Steel Corporation and Vietnam Cement Industries Corporation hold 30 per cent and 5 per cent, respectively.        
	While a memorandum of understanding for the project was signed in May 2007, the joint venture agreement was reached in August 2008 after the completion of a feasibility study.        
	However, the Tatas are now facing problems over land acquisition in Vietnam  a problem that has plagued several Tata projects in India as well because of the difficulty in acquiring large, contiguous tracts of land.        
	Tata Steels own projects in Jharkhand, Chhattisgarh and Orissa have been pushed back by four to five years because of land acquisition troubles. Lakshmi Mittals projects in Orissa and Jharkhand and Posco in Orissa are facing the same problem.        
	Sources said the land that had been identified by the Tata Steel venture had been given away to another investor. This tract was in the Ha Tinh province of north central Vietnam within the Vung Ang Economic Zone, a coastal location. The joint venture wanted a 2.2 kilometre stretch of shoreline for the project.        
	When contacted, a Tata Steel spokesperson said the company had asked for an alternative site. We hope to get the land in the next few weeks. The issues have been resolved. The new site is next to our originally selected site, he told The Telegraph.        
	The shape and size of the land is important for the optimal layout of a plant of this magnitude, he said, adding that Vietnamese government has been encouraging and supporting the Tata Steel venture.        
	Under the terms of the agreement, the steel venture was supposed to get a 30 per cent stake in Thach Khe iron ore mines which will be utilised by Tata Steel for steelmaking in later stages.        
	However, the company encountered a problem of a different kind there as the iron ore was found to be high in alumina. Tata Steel did considerable research to utilise the iron ore for steel making.        
	In India, steel makers have to struggle to secure mining leases which can be a cumbersome process and fraught with legal complications.        
	However, the problems for the Vietnamese venture wont end with the acquisition of land. It must then obtain an investment licence from the local authority to start work on the project.        
	Tata Steel officials said it would take at least 30 months to complete the first phase of the project. The company is starting off with a cold rolled mill (CRM) as it will take time to develop the mine. Until it can achieve backward integration by establishing a plant to make hot rolled coils, the CRM plant will source the raw material locally.        
	Vietnam is the only location where Tata Steel is looking to build a new plant outside India that will be fed by captive mines. Corus did not own any mines, creating problems for the Tatas in a weak global market for steel.

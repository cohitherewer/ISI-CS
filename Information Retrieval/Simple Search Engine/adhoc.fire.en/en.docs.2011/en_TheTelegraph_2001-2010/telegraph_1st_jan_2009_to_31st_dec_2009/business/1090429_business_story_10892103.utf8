	New Delhi, April 28: Bangladesh may allow India to use its new deep sea port off Chittagong for exports from its north eastern states.         
	The new port, the first phase of which is expected to be completed by 2016, can be used as a regional transit hub for Indias northeastern states, Nepal and Bhutan.        
	Top officials said they expected Bangladesh to ask for better transit through Indian territory to Nepal, Bhutan and perhaps even China for letting India use its port.        
	India has been keen on using Bangla ports for exports from its land-locked northeastern states. Chittagong used to be the preferred port till 1965. But a war between India and Pakistan stopped commerce through that route.         
	Successive Bangla governments have ignored the demand for reopening Chittagong port for Indian use. Bangla strategists had earlier said the route could breach the countrys security. Irked by Bangladeshs attitude in the past over opening up Chittagong port, India had started talks with Myanmar to develop Sitwe port in the Arakan province as an alternative gateway.        
	Bangladesh, whose Chittagong port is increasingly getting overloaded, now plans to build a modern port with large container facilities which it could offer as a regional trade hub.         
	Pacific Consultant International (PCI) of Japan has prepared a feasibility study for the projected $1.2-billion deep sea port which will be built off Sonadia island, 60 km from the existing Chittagong port.         
	The port, to be built in three phases, will have six harbours and a capacity to handle 100 million tonnes of cargo.         
	If transit facilities are allowed and the port connects to mainland India, it could rival the deep sea port project India is planning in Bengal. At present, Sri Lankas Colombo port is the favoured port for exports from south India because of its modern facilities. As a result, about 60 per cent of the container traffic to and from south India is trans-shipped from Colombo and not from Chennai.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | M amp;M dumps Africa plan
                                                                                                               M amp;M dumps Africa plan
          GARIMA SINGH NEOGY                                    
	New Delhi, Oct. 3: Utility vehicle major Mahindra amp; Mahindra has indefinitely shelved plans to assemble vehicle units in South Africa.        
	The company was scheduled to start assembling units, imported from India, in 2010. Weak sales and adverse economic conditions are the reasons why the company had to stall the project.        
	We have put on hold our plans for assembly operations in South Africa. We need a critical mass of volume to begin assembly but contrary to that, our sales have dropped considerably, Pravin N. Shah, executive vice-president (overseas operations) of Mahindra amp; Mahindra told The Telegraph. Also, the economy in South Africa continues to show a downward trend. So, we decided to abstain from doing anything now, Shah added.        
	In June this year, the company had announced that it would ship vehicles as knocked-down units and assemble them at the existing plant of a South African firm.        
	At present, M amp;M operates in South Africa through its wholly owned subsidiary Mahindra S.A. The company sells the Bolero, the Scorpio and the Xylo in South Africa.         
	With over 30 dealerships across South Africa, Mahindra is trying to gain a strong foothold in the market.        
	Since its operations in 2004, Mahindra S.A has achieved a significant growth selling more than 11,000 units.        
	Shah said sales dropped from 4,000 units to 1,600 units per annum last year because of weak economic conditions.        
	Company sources said local assembly in South Africa will have cost benefits for Mahindra. A better access to the US is also an attraction.         
	South Africa is the cheapest shipping destination from India. It costs $700 to ship a vehicle from India to South Africa. Each container carrying three vehicles sports a price tag of around $1,000.

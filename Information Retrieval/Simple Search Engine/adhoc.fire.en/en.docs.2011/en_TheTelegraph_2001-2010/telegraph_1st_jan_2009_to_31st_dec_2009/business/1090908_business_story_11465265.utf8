          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                            
	Mumbai, Sept. 7: The sensex smashed the 16000-barrier for the first time this year as investors shovelled cash into equities, buoyed by firm global markets, positive company announcements and indications of better rainfall in several parts of the country.        
	The bellwether index rose 2.1 per cent, or 327.20 points, to close at 16016.32  a new 15-month high. The National Stock Exchanges 50-share Nifty also breached the critical resistance level of 4750 and closed at its highest level since May 30, 2008 at 4782.90.        
	Market mavens said overseas investors were funneling funds into local bourses amid indications that the market for initial public offerings (IPOs) had improved with the Oil Indias maiden issue oversubscribed on the very first day.        
	There were fears that the poor rainfall could impact Indias economic growth. But investors have read reports of better rainfall in the past few days, an analyst said.        
	D.D. Rathi, vice-president (research) at Anand Rathi Financial Services, said the rally was driven by the sharp increase in liquidity and that there had been no fundamental change in the market dynamics.        
	Apurva Shah, vice-president and head of research at brokerage Prabhudas Lilladher, said the momentum had been building up over the past few days and better global cues had triggered the rally.        
	Hectic short covering in the latter part of trading also helped the indices to surge. Arun Kejriwal, director at KRIS, felt that the late burst of monsoon rains had boosted investor sentiment.        
	The sensex had opened fairly strong at 15793.27 and hit an intra-day high of 16035.50.         
	Meanwhile, the Oil India IPO was fully subscribed on the opening day. Data from the NSE showed that against a total issue size of 2,64,49,982 shares, the issue generated bids of 3,38,01,492 shares, thereby showing a subscription of 1.28 times. The bookbuilt issue has a price band of Rs 950 to Rs 1,050 per share.

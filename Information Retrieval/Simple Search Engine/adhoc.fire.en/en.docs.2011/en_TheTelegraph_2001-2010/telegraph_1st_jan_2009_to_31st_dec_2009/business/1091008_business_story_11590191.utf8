The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Reliance banks on ample reserves
                                                                                                               Reliance banks on ample reserves
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                            
	Mumbai, Oct. 7: Reliance Industries will need to scoop out just Rs 1,643 crore from its massive Rs 77,441-crore reserves to pay for the 1:1 bonus that it is offering its 35 lakh shareholders.        
	Even so, the bonus issue by Reliance will rank as the biggest ever in Indias corporate history, dwarfing those by Indian Oil Corporation, GAIL (India), Tata Consultancy Services and Jindal Steel amp; Power in recent times.        
	Bonus shares are issued to existing shareholders by converting free reserves of a company into equity capital. Thus, a bonus issue not only increases the equity capital of a company, but it also leads to a reduction in its accumulated reserves or retained earnings. Analysts, therefore, look at the extent of reserve capitalisation (accumulated reserves converted into capital) after a company declares a bonus issue.         
	Some of the recent bonus issues, particularly from small companies, have raised eyebrows since they have resulted in a conversion of a large part of their reserves into capital. Though in the case of Reliance its bonus proposal will increase the equity capital to Rs 3,286 crore, observers are confident that the Mukesh Ambani flagship will be able to service this enhanced capital.        
	Oil and gas analysts, who were taken aback by the bonus announcement, said the move reflected the confidence of the RIL management in the future prospects of the company.         
	The view in the market is that Reliance will gain enormously once it ramps up output from its KG-D6 field to its full capacity of 80 million cubic metres of gas a day. At present, it is producing 40 million cubic metres of gas a day. Observers also believe its petrochemical operations will bounce back once the recovery starts late next year.        
	We must look at the cash flows that will come from the KG basin and the refining business. The RIL management is confident about its operations. It (the bonus issue) was not made keeping the legal dispute with RNRL in mind, said an analyst.        
	RIL also has a strong cushion in the form of treasury stock which can be used to fund its expansion programmes. The value of this stock is estimated at around Rs 40,000 crore.        
	Recently, Petroleum Trust, classified among the promoter group of RIL, sold 1.50 crore shares of the company at an average price of Rs 2,125 apiece, thereby raising Rs 3,188 crore.        
	Deepak Pareek, oil and gas analyst at Angel Broking, said the bonus issue was a signal that the company expected robust growth in all its businesses.        
	However, some felt that the stock might be weighed down by the outcome of its gas dispute with RNRL.

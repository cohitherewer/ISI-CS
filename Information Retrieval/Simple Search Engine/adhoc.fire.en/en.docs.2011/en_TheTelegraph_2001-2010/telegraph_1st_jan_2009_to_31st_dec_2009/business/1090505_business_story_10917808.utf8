The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Maruti bets big on A-star
                                                                                                               Maruti bets big on A-star
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                          Nakanishi: Growth plans                                  
	New Delhi, May 4: Maruti Suzuki India today said it was expecting 5 per cent sales growth this year on the back of good overseas demand for the A-star.        
	Indias No. 1 car maker is targeting 1 lakh export of the A-star against 70,000 for all models last year. A-star export stood at 20,000 in 2008-09.        
	Production target for the car is 1.4 lakh for this fiscal, with the forecast for local sales being 40,000 units.        
	In export, Europe will account for the largest share at 60,000 units.        
	Last year, the company exported 70,000 vehicles, comprising the A-stars and 50,000 units of the Maruti 800, Alto, Zen Estilo and Gypsies. We are confident of exporting one lakh units of the A-star, but exports of other models can be a little lower than last year, said Shinzo Nakanishi, managing director of Maruti Suzuki.        
	Marutis domestic sales are expected to benefit from a good demand in rural areas.         
	The Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers has projected the industry will grow 3-5 per cent in the current financial year. Our hope is to do better than that, said Nakanishi.                    
	To push sales, Maruti will set up stockyards.                                 
	Maruti will also induct 1,000 sales executives in its 680 outlets in the country, he said.                                 
	These outlets have a present strength of 15,000 people.        
	He said the firms first stockyard will come up by the middle of this year in South India, but declined to comment on details such as time-frame, investment, location and size of the stockyard.        
	 quot;We are in advanced stages of negotiations, quot; he said, adding the company is not going through government channels, but directly negotiating with land owners for acquiring land.        
	Maruti however said it would be very difficult to attain a double-digit growth rate in fiscal 2009-10.        
	 quot;Last year, we saw very good demand from rural areas and to push our sales, we will recruit more rural dealerships sales executives (RDSEs), quot; said Nakanishi adding that the company currently has a strength of 2,500 RDSEs.         
	As for companys export target, Maruti aims to export about one lakh units of A-Star to Nissan and some European and non-European countries. In addition, it hopes to export a little lower than 50,000 units of models like M800, Alto and Zen Estilo.        
	But Maruti has tried to beat the slowdown through new product launches that helped it post a fourth straight month of higher sales in April.        
	Nakanishi said Maruti was planning to launch a new hatchback, Ritz, later this month, which would be positioned in the same category as its popular Swift model. He also reiterated the company had no plans for ultra low-cost cars to compete with Tata Motors Rs one lakh Nano.        
	Maruti plans to spend Rs 1,800 crore in the current fiscal. This is part of the Rs 9,000 crore investment spread over 2007-2011 the company announced earlier. However, Nakanishi said more investment may be needed in future, but did not disclose details.                                            
	Last year, our profitability was not satisfactory ... some recovery will be shown (in the June quarter), quot; he said.

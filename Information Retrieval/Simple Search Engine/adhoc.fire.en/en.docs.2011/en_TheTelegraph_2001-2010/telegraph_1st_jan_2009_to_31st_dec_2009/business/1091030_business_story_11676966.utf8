The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | SAIL selloff in two phases
                                                                                                               SAIL selloff in two phases

	New Delhi, Oct. 29: State-run Steel Authority of Indias proposal of a follow-on public offer of 10 per cent equity will come up before the Union cabinet soon.         
	The steel ministry also wants it to be followed by the sale of another 10 per cent next year.        
	Steel minister Virbhadra Singh told The Telegraph, Our proposal for a follow-on public offer of 5 per cent fresh equity and a 5 per cent stake sale by the government will go to the cabinet and we will next year come up with a similar second tranche of 10 per cent.        
	Singh will also set a strict timeline for SAIL to finish its ongoing expansion and modernisation programme, which he described as going slow.        
	He said finding a new chief executive to succeed S.K. Roongta, who retires in May, was a priority.         
	The problem was that senior officers within SAIL who could have taken over did not qualify as they did not have a clear two years of service left. I will be looking for someone with experience in steel as well as a great business sense.         
	SAIL wants to make a market offering of 5 per cent fresh equity to garner funds for its ongoing expansion programme.         
	Officials said the government could piggyback on this by offering to sell a matching 5 per cent stake.        
	SAIL stock prices are going up ... by the next financial year the stock should be even higher, fetching an even better realisation (from a two-tranche selloff), the minister said. They (financial advisers) tell me the government and SAIL taken together can earn between Rs 16,000 crore and Rs 20,000 crore from the two-tranche sale.         
	The government owns 86 per cent of the steel maker, which has its own iron ore and coal mines.         
	A dilution of holding by 5 per cent later this year can earn SAIL about Rs 4,000 crore.         
	The government can hope to earn a similar amount if it sells matching equity. After reaching a 52-week high of Rs 197.65 last week, the SAIL share price is now at Rs 168.05.        
	Analysts say the scrip can rise up to 50 per cent over the next 18 to 24 months on the back of increased demand for steel.

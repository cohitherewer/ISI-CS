	Calcutta, May 28: Industrial gas maker BOC India Ltd plans to invest Rs 1,000 crore over the next three years to expand its reach in the local market.        
	The company  majority of which is owned by Linde Group of Germany  will build an air separation unit at the Rourkela plant of Steel Authority of India Ltd for Rs 500 crore.        
	It is also negotiating for a similar contract with another steel maker, S.K. Menon, managing director of BOC India, said on the sidelines of the 73rd annual general meeting of the company.         
	He said the investment could translate into revenues of Rs 800 crore annually, when the facilities are fully operational. The separation facility at Rourkela will have two units each with a capacity of 855 tonnes per day.        
	The company also plans to build a unit for electronic gases  mainly required in making solar photovoltaic cells  at Hyderabad within a special economic zone.        
	Menon also said that BOC was in the process of building a merchant plant for Rs 150 crore. The company plans to finance the new projects mostly through debts. At present, it is a debt-free company.        
	S.M. Datta, chairman of BOC India, allayed shareholders apprehension that the Linde Group would try to delist the company from the local bourses. There is no such plan now, he said. Linde Group owns just below 90 per cent in BOC India.

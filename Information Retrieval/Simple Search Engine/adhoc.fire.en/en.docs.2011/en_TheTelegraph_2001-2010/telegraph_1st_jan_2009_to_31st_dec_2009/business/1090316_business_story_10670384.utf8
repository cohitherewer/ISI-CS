                                                                                                                 Q amp;A      A great gift
                                If I gift money to my wife who deposits it in her PPF account, will the amount be deducted from my taxable income?          M.S.B. Saha, Calcutta
                    The accrued interest income or withdrawal from a PPF account is currently tax-exempt. Hence, the provision of clubbing of income will not be applicable in your case. Gift tax has been abolished. If your wife invests the gifted amount in equities or equity-linked mutual funds and sells the investment after one year, then also there will be no tax liability as there is no long-term capital gains tax on equity investments. However, if she invests the money in any other instrument, you will have to pay income tax on the income arising from that investment.                                  Filing return is must      Does every individual who has been allotted a permanent account number file income tax return?        Deepak Kumar Chowdhury, Titagarh
                    g of income tax return is mandatory if an assessee has taxable income. If your total annual income is greater than the basic exemption limit, it is compulsory to file income tax return. But if your total annual income is less than the basic exemption limit, filing of income return is voluntary, irrespective of whether you hold a PAN or not.                                    Relative identity      I am a pensioner. I have recently received Rs 2,74,125 as gift from a close relative who is an NRI. Is this amount taxable?        B.Ghosh, Calcutta
                    You dont have to pay any income tax on the gift, provided the NRI person is your close relative as defined by the Income Tax Act. A close relative is defined as 1) spouse of an individual; 2) brother or sister of an individual; 3) brother or sister of the spouse of an individual; 4) brother or sister of either of the parents of an individual; 5) any lineal ascendant or descendant of an individual; 6) any lineal ascendant or descendant of the spouse of an individual and 7) spouse of the person referred to in clause 2 to 6. Besides, the gift amount being lower than Rs 3 lakh, it also doesnt attract FEMA provisions.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Govt sticks to airline stance
                                                                                                               Govt sticks to airline stance
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Patel: Stern move                                  
	New Delhi, Aug. 3: The government today once again ruled out a bailout package for private airlines, a day after they called off their proposed strike on August 18.        
	There cannot be a financial bailout for any of the private airlines. Any issue, which is reasonable and fair, the government will try its best and do whatever is possible, civil aviation minister Praful Patel said today.        
	We are not even bailing out Air India, which is owned by the government, Patel added.         
	The proposed strike by the private airlines lost fizz after SpiceJet, the countrys biggest low-cost airline, yesterday broke ranks and joined IndiGo, saying it was not interested in a bailout or a confrontation with the government.         
	Officials said they expected the civil aviation ministry to restart talks with airport bodies and airlines, and get the newly appointed Airports Economic Regulatory Authority of India to put a leash on airport charges.         
	At the same time, the ministry is likely to urge state governments to cut jet fuel taxes. The levy varies across states.        
	Jet fuel comprises 35-40 per cent of an airlines costs, and a cut in taxes can help bring many of them out of the red.        
	Now that the airlines have backed out from the confrontation, we have to try and see how we can address their grievances, the officials said.

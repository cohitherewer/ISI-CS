                                                                                                               Subsidiary weighs buyouts
          SOUNAK MITRA                              
	Calcutta, July 22: Wipro Consumer Care and Lighting is considering buyouts. Over the years, the company has acquired many brands and firms, globally.        
	We are open to it but will only go for a deal if it fits into our area of operations and strategy, Wipro Consumer president Vineet Agarwal told The Telegraph. Wipro Consumer is the consumer care division of infotech major Wipro.        
	The company is looking for buyouts in both the personal care and lighting businesses in India and abroad, a source said. We have heard that the company has already appointed an adviser, the source said.        
	We may look at a business we are not present in. But that should suit our strategy and the areas we operate in, Agarwal said.        
	According to the source, Wipro Consumer is exploring possibilities in newer geographies and is open to acquiring some once-popular local brands.        
	When asked, Agarwal declined to give any time frame and the size of a possible acquisition.         
	Earlier, we had acquired small brands such as Chandrika and a bigger company such as Unza. So, anything is possible, depending on what we get, he said.        
	However, the source said a deal was expected only by the end of the current financial year.        
	Wipro Consumer acquired Singapore-based Unza Holdings in 2007 for Rs 1,010.2 crore in an all-cash deal. In 2003, it acquired the Glucovita brand from Hindustan Unilever for about Rs 5 crore.

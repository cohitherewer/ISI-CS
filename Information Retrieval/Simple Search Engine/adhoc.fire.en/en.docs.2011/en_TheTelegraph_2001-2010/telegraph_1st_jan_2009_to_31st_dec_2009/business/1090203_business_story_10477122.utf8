          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                              NAME GAME      
	New Delhi, Feb. 2: The outlets of Wal-Mart, in association with Bharti Enterprises, will be called BestPrice Modern Wholesale.        
	Officials of Bharti Wal-Mart Private Limited said the wholesale stores were due to open in Punjab anytime between April and June this year, and around 50,000-65,000 small store owners had registered as buyers.         
	Wal-Mart, when it announced the venture with Bharti in 2007, had said that it would not lend its name to the venture.         
	Indian laws do not allow Wal-Mart to enter direct retail. Foreign investment, up to 51 per cent, is allowed in single brand retail.         
	However, 100 per cent FDI is allowed in the cash-and-carry, or wholesale, business. Germanys Metro is in this segment, while Wal-Mart is preparing for the launch and Frances Carrefour firming up plans.        
	According to analysts, Wal-Marts experience in the wholesale business will come in handy when organised retail is opened up to foreigners.        
	Raj Jain, managing director and CEO of Bharti Wal-Mart, said, When we announced our joint venture in 2007, we gave ourselves a window of 18-24 months to launch our first wholesale cash-and-carry store. We are firmly on track. The company expects to open 10-15 wholesale facilities and employ approximately 5,000 over the next seven years.        
	A range of 6,000-10,000 products, including food to non-food items, will be available at wholesale prices, allowing retailers and business owners to increase efficiency and lower the cost of operations, a company official said.        
	Bharti Wal-Mart has a distribution centre near Chandigarh. A recent government study has said that organised retail poses no threat to small shops. Farmers and consumers stand to gain from competitive prices, the study said.

                                                                                                               Core growth at 1.4%
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, March 6: Infrastructure industries grew 1.4 per cent in January against 3.6 per cent a year ago.        
	Though low, the growth is on the back of a much worse performance by industry overall in December, generating optimism among analysts.        
	This is a good signal that the key infrastructure sectors are showing positive signs. The cut in key interest rates by the RBI might result in robust growth in infrastructure and the results could be seen from October, said Prof. N.R. Bhanumurthy of the Institute of Economic Growth.        
	The January show is ascribed to crude oil production, which shrank 8.1 per cent.        
	Cement grew 8.3 per cent compared with 5.6 per cent in January 2008, while steel saw near flat growth at 1.2 per cent against 2 per cent last year, according to latest data released by the commerce ministry.        
	During April-January 2008-09, infrastructure industries grew 3.2 per cent over 5.7 per cent a year ago.        
	Shubhada Rao, chief economist with Yes Bank, said, The positive growth in cement production and the flat production in steel and coal are an indication that the stimulus packages have had some impact.

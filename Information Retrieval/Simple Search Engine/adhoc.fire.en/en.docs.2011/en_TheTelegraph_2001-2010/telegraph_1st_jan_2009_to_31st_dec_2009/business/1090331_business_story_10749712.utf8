The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | GM chief shown the door
                                                                                                               GM chief shown the door
          SHERYL GAY STOLBERG AMP; BILL VLASIC                               
	Washington, March 30: The White House on Sunday pushed out the chairman of General Motors and instructed Chrysler to form a partnership with the Italian auto maker Fiat within 30 days as conditions for receiving another much-needed round of government aid.        
	The decision to ask GMs chairman and chief executive Rick Wagoner to resign caught Detroit and Washington by surprise, and it underscored the Obama administrations determination to keep a tight rein on the companies it is bailing out  a level of government involvement in business perhaps not seen since the Great Depression.        
	President Obama is scheduled to announce details of the auto package at the White House on Monday, but two senior officials, offering a preview on condition of anonymity, made clear that some form of bankruptcy  a quick, court-supervised restructuring, as they described it  could still be an option for one or both companies.        
	Obamas auto industry task force, in a report released on Sunday night assessing the viability of both companies and detailing the administrations new plans for them, concluded that Chrysler could not survive as a stand-alone company.         
	The report said the company would get no more help from the government unless it can finalise an alliance with Fiat by April 30. It must also reduce its debt and healthcare obligations.                                      
	If a deal is reached the administration would consider another loan of $6 billion to Chrysler.               [+uc('New York Times   News Service')+]

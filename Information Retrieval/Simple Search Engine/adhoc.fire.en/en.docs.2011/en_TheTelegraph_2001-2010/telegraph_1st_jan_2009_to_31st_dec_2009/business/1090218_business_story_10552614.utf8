                                                                                                               Meet today to revive closed tea gardens
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Calcutta, Feb. 17: The Tea Board will meet the owners and representatives of closed tea gardens tomorrow to review the progress in the reopening of 12 gardens in Bengal.        
	Others to attend the meeting include the additional commerce secretary, senior officials of the state and the central governments, and the representatives of commercial banks.        
	Bengal has recently announced incentives to open the gardens. A committee has been constituted to review the situation and recommend to the government the course of action according to the provisions of the Tea Act, 1953.         
	The Centre had also announced a rehabilitation package, while the Tea Board is facilitating discussions with the owners, bankers and trade unions.        
	On December 15, the state government announced a scheme to open the gardens, which are in the Dooars.         
	The scheme is valid for two years. A garden will be eligible for support if it is registered with a tea company for not less than five years and closed or abandoned for over one year.        
	Last week, the board said production in India rose about four per cent to 981 million kg in 2008. Exports were up 10 per cent to 196.03 million kg.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Audit body opposes KPMG
                                                                                                               Audit body opposes KPMG
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                            
	Mumbai, Jan. 15: The selection of auditors to restate the accounts of Satyam Computer Services is turning into a major controversy.        
	The Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (ICAI) has raised questions about the newly appointed boards decision to give KPMG the mandate to restate accounts on the very day that it started work along with Deloitte Haskins amp; Sells on Satyams books.         
	The ICAI is of the view that since KPMG is not registered with the institute, the firm should not be permitted to restate Satyams accounts.         
	Audits can be only carried out by professionals  either individuals or firms  registered with the ICAI. The board should not appoint a firm that is not a professional, ICAI president Ved Jain told The Telegraph.        
	In the case of Price Waterhouse, when something went wrong, the ICAI was brought into the picture. Therefore, in a way the board has been held responsible. The same will not hold true for KPMG, he added.        
	Jain further said he intended to write to the Satyam board to bring this fact to their notice. It is possible that the board may not be aware. And while it is up to the board to select an auditor, there are several Indian audit firms that the board could have considered, quot; he said.        
	Reacting to the ICAIs view, a KPMG spokesperson told a news agency, It is our understanding that the scope of work (at Satyam) to be finalised is not reserved for CAs registered with the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India.        
	We are working with the new board of Satyam Computer. The scope of work and terms of reference are being discussed with a view to their finalisation, he added.        
	The ICAI, however, does not have an objection to the appointment of Deloitte Haskins amp; Sells as the latter is registered with the institute.        
	Under the Chartered Accountants Act, 1949, foreign firms cannot offer audit services in India, said a leading chartered accountant. Therefore, firms such as Ernst amp; Young have a local arm called S.R. Batliboi and even KPMG has a local arm called BSR that offers audit services.         
	Price Waterhouse and Deloitte Haskins amp; Sells are exceptions since they have been around long before the ICAI Act was passed. Price Waterhouse  the audit firm  is a part of the worldwide entity PricewaterhouseCoopers.         
	Likewise, Deloite Haskins amp; Sells is part of the global entity Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu.        
	The ICAI, which has already issued a showcause notice to Price Waterhouse, also believes that the latters stance on the Satyam fraud does not absolve them fully.         
	Price Waterhouse issued a statement on Tuesday stating that no one should rely any more on its audit reports and opinions of Satyam since these were generated on the basis of suspect financial statements provided by the company.         
	This does not absolve them of the defaults already committed, if any, Ved Jain told a news agency.

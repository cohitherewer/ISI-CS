          JAYATI GHOSE                          Whats brewing?                                  
	New Delhi, Dec. 7: Australian coffee giants  bbs cafe and The Coffee Club  are coming to India next year.        
	The Coffee Club is a speciality coffee bar, offering coffee liquor and gourmet cuisine, while bbs cafe is for those looking for quality products at reasonable prices in a non-intimidating atmosphere.        
	With investments of over Rs 100 crore, bbs cafe and The Coffee Club expect to open 10-15 bars in the metros over the next 3-5 years. At present, both the brands are looking for master franchisees.         
	The Coffee Club is Australias largest coffee group with more than 200 outlets serving over 40 million cups a year. Generating more than $260 million in revenues in 2008-09,         
	In India, we are planning to start with three outlets in the major metro cities by 2010-end and, depending on the success, take them to 15 over the next 2-3 years, said Gary T. Moore, general manager (franchising) at Minor Food Group, which is the international franchisee for The Coffee Club.         
	With competition limited to only two home-grown chains  Cafe Coffee Day and Barista  and the UK-based Costa Coffee, bbs cafe is confident of capturing the market.        
	Our expansion focus will be high-street locations and malls. These are areas of high footfalls. We could also look at expanding towards metro and railway stations and airports, said Gavin Nixon, sales and leading manager, Retail Food Group, which holds the international franchisee licence for bbs cafe.        
	London-based International Coffee Organisations executive director Nestor Osorio said consumption in India, which was at around 1.3-1.5 million bags per year (60 kg per bag), would double in the next 5-10 years.        
	With the coffee culture taking off in India, we are confident that our signature range of coffee blends will be able to capture a significant market share, Nixon said. bbs cafe selects, roasts and blends its own coffee.

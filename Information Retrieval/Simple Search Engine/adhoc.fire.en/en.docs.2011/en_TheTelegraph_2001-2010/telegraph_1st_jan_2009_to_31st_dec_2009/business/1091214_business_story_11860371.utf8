The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Telecom bar on China firms 
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Telecom bar on China firms

	New Delhi, Dec. 13: Chinese companies have been barred from participating in the Rs 10,000-crore optic fibre cable project, which will put the defence authorities in a position to release spectrum for cellular services.        
	Not only will they be barred from bidding but also the participating firms cannot source equipment from them.        
	Besides, all basic equipment must be made in India.        
	The government has placed these conditions in a tender document, prepared by Bharat Sanchar Nigam Limited (BSNL), to allay security worries over Chinese equipment entering defence, said officials.        
	There have been allegations before that Chinese firm Huawei has links with the Peoples Liberation Army, which has worried the Indian authorities        
	State-run BSNL will soon put up the tender to invite equipment manufacturers to build the 40,000km alternative communication network for defence forces.        
	Defence will shift some of its communication requirements to the alternative network, freeing spectrum for commercial mobile services.        
	These parameters have been created to maintain a high level of security and safety for the communication network being built for defence, said officials.        
	Another reason for being cautious is because the network will also act as a secure backbone for communication in the face of disaster.        
	The home ministry has decided to connect around 5,000 key government offices across the country through the optic fibre network to ensure that the ministries stay in touch with the affected areas in the case of a disaster.        
	The telecom ministry fears that suspect vendors may install back-door entries, remote login facilities and spyware in networks and hardware.         
	This could be used to remotely bring down the network or to monitor it.         
	The intelligence agencies are particularly concerned about Chinese vendors.         
	Bidders will also need to transfer technology and intellectual property rights for the services to BSNL, officials added.        
	Industry sources said global names such as Motorola, Ericsson, Alcatel Lucent, Nokia Siemens Networks as well as software majors such as TCS, Infosys, Wipro, HCL, Tech Mahindra were likely to bid.

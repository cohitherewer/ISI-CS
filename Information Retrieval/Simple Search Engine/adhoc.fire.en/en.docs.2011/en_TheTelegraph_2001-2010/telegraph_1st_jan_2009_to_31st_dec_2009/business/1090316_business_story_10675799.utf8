                                                                                                               Greater PSU verve in hiring

	New Delhi, March 15: State-run firms are bullish on hiring, but a survey says the mood is not the same among private entities.         
	Steel Authority of India Ltd (SAIL) plans to recruit 4,500 in 2009-10 compared with 1,225 in the current fiscal.         
	Power utility NTPC says it will employ around 1,000 engineers and managers in the coming fiscal.         
	However, the forecast is not so positive for private firms.        
	In a survey by human resource consultancy firm Manpower, 64 per cent of private employers were uncertain about their hiring plans.         
	Still, India topped the list of 33 countries in the survey on hiring intention.        
	K. C. Chakraborty, chairman of Punjab National Bank, said, We will be hiring more people this year. We will hire 2,000 people in specific areas such as credit, treasury, corporate communications and marketing.        
	The State Bank of India will recruit 25,000 in 2009-10, 2.5 times more than the previous fiscal.         
	Many will be middle- and senior-level managers, human resource consultants said.         
	State-run banks are experiencing a boom at a time when manufacturing has shrunk and services have reported lower growth.        
	According to finance ministry data, between September and January, banks have lent Rs 1,01,000 crore, an increase of 28 per cent.         
	State-run oil exploration and refining companies are also upbeat. ONGC says it will hire 125 engineers and scientists every year for the next few years, while Indian Oil will recruit around 700 engineers and officers every year till 2011-2012.         
	However, the numbers of SAIL have come as a surprise as the steel industry is facing falling prices.        
	According to SAIL director (personnel) G. Ojha, We need more people for certain disciplines in our steel mills. We plan to look ahead and not just at the current situation.         
	The company is betting big on large infrastructure projects slated to come up over the next five years, which will spur demand.         
	SAIL plans to spend around Rs 54,000 crore over the next few years to add 10 million tonnes to its capacity of 26 million tonnes.         
	Electricity generation reported a flat growth rate of 1.8 per cent in January, but a huge projected shortfall means power firms will invest in expansion and recruitment.         
	NTPC officials said, We plan to enhance our installed capacity to 75,000 MW from 29,894 MW by 2017.         
	We have recruited about 1,225 in the current year and are planning to hire more than 1,000 engineering and management professionals every year in the next few years, the officials said.        
	PSUs have also promoted job quotas, which were snubbed by private firms.

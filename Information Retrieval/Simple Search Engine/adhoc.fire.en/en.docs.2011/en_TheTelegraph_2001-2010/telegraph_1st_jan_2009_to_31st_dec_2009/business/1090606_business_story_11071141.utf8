          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Drill time                                  
	New Delhi, June 5: Cairn India is likely to begin production from its Rajasthan oilfields later this month. This is the second major crude discovery after ONGCs Bombay High.         
	Prime Minister Manmohan Singh may be present when the crude is first pumped out for commercial production, sources said.         
	The government and company officials may schedule the launch for the third week of this month even as price negotiations with buyers IOC, HPCL and MRPL are on.         
	However, sources said the negotiations would not affect production as an interim price could be set.        
	The government has found buyers in Indian Oil, Hindustan Petroleum and Mangalore Refinery for only 2.4 million tonnes of the 8.75mt peak output planned by Cairn. It will produce 1.5 million tonnes in 2009-10, but the three firms are willing to buy no more than 0.7 million tonnes.        
	Crude from Cairns field will cut Indias oil import bill by 7 per cent at peak production of 175,000 barrels a day. Output of 30,000 barrels a day will begin in the June-August period and increase to 80,000 barrels in the last three months of the year. Peak production will be reached in 2011.        
	Cairn India acquired the stake in the area from Royal Dutch Shell in 2002 and discovered oil in January 2004. The area comprises three fields Mangala, Bhagyam and Aishwariya.        
	The ONGC board, which has a 30 per cent stake in the Rajasthan fields, is meeting tomorrow to decide on the revised investment plan of $1.01 billion.

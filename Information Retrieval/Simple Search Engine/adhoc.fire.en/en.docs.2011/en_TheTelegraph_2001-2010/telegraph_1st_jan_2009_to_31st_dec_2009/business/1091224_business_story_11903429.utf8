          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      Singh: Weighing options                          
	New Delhi, Dec. 23: Prime Minister Manmohan Singh may consider freeing fuel prices from government control when he reviews the health of state-run oil firms at a meeting on January 13.        
	Indian Oil, Bharat Petroleum and Hindustan Petroleum are projected to lose Rs 45,000 crore for selling petrol, diesel, domestic LPG and kerosene below costs in the current fiscal.        
	Finance minister Pranab Mukherjee, petroleum minister Murli Deora and Planning Commission deputy chairman Montek Singh Ahluwalia will attend the meeting along with the heads of the state-run oil firms.         
	Former Planning Commission member Kirit S. Parikh, who heads a committee on fuel pricing, may also join the discussions, officials said.        
	The petroleum ministry would make a presentation on the various aspects of oil and gas  exploration, refining and marketing.         
	Since the downstream (refining) sector will be discussed, so the issue of under-recoveries (from selling below costs) will be flagged, officials said.        
	The three PSU refiners are losing Rs 3.49 a litre on petrol, Rs 2.38 a litre on diesel, Rs 18.13 a litre on kerosene and Rs 250.67 per LPG cylinder.

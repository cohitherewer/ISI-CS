The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Kingfisher pilots to earn less
                                                                                                               Kingfisher pilots to earn less

	Mumbai, Feb. 6: Kingfisher Airlines has slashed the salaries of its pilots, taking a cue from Jet Airways.        
	Pilots said the pay cuts were as high as Rs 80,000 a month. However, airline officials claimed that it was no more than a quarter of that figure.        
	Earlier, we were being paid a salary of Rs 4.30 lakh a month. Now, it has been cut to Rs 3.50 lakh, all in the name of integration (with the erstwhile Deccan), a Kingfisher pilot said on the condition of anonymity.        
	Pilots have been flying fewer hours since October after airlines were forced to rationalise routes in the wake of the downturn. Last years tentative agreement between Jet and Kingfisher has also reduced the number of flights that each airline flies.         
	Earlier, the salary package was based on 70 hours of flying every month.        
	Late last year, Kingfisher had migrated to the internationally prevalent productivity-linked remuneration structure. There have been no fresh changes after that, said an airline official.         
	At worst, the new structure in place would make a difference of 4 to 5 per cent or around Rs 20,000, said another Kingfisher official.

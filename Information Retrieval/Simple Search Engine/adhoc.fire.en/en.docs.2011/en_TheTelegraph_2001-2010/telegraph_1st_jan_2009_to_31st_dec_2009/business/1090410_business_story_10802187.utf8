	Calcutta, April 9: The Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority (IRDA) is working on a fresh set of norms for bancassurance to reduce costs for consumers.         
	The guidelines will be ready in three months, IRDA member (actuary) R. Kannan said here today. Under bancassurance, banks act as agents to sell policies through their branches.        
	The cost of distributing products through bancassurance is less than that through agents who spend more time and money to travel and convince their clients, Kannan said on the sidelines of an interactive session organised by the Merchants Chamber of Commerce.        
	The revised guidelines will allow insurers to sell policies through banks at a cheaper rate, meaning lower premiums. There would also be a cap on the sum assured for bancassurance.        
	Also on the agenda of the regulator is an ombudsman to address consumer grievances. The IRDA will organise a seminar to suggest measures to improve a process of redressal soon, Kannan said.        
	The regulator may allow insurers to sell policies through post offices.         
	It has expressed concern over the rising overall cost of operations, which can hurt the capacity of firms to meet contingency requirements.        
	To restore discipline, it has begun a study on expenses, and the report was expected in the next three months.        
	The regulator is taking the issue of rising expenses more seriously after the recession badly shook the global insurance majors.  
	Kannan said, Ideally the overall expenses should have been at 25 per cent of total premium but in the last four-five years it has risen from 22 per cent to 29 per cent.        
	It was noted that when all costs concerning business including acquisition and claim yield on investment were on the decline. This situation could hurt the solvency margin, he said.         
	The regulator is also looking into insurance portability, which will allow a consumer to shift to another insurer while paying the same premium and getting the same benefits. We are looking into it. Portability will offer more convenience to the consumers, he said.

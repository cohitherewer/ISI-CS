                                                                                                               September date for Oil India flotation
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                                N.M Borah.Weighing options      
	New Delhi, June 2: Oil India Ltd  the countrys second largest explorer  plans to come out with an initial public offer by September to take advantage of the buoyant stock market.        
	We have tentatively informed the board about a road map according to which the IPO should be there by September, but this is subject to market conditions, Oil India chairman N.M. Borah said.        
	Stock markets are reviving and so we have started dialogues again with advisers for the IPO. The timing, however, would be decided in consultation with the government and after the approval from the companys board, he said.        
	Petroleum secretary R.S. Pandey said, Oil India was earlier given the mandate to go ahead with the IPO, but they did not because share prices crashed. Now share prices are correcting, so I think this should be done by September.        
	However, he said there were no proposals for a follow-on public offer of Oil and Natural Gas Corporation Ltd and Indian Oil Corporation Ltd.        
	Borah said the Oil India IPO would involve an issue of 26.4 million shares, or about 11 per cent of its equity, and the sale of a 10 per cent stake to state-run firms. The funds will be used for exploration and production in 2009-10 and 2010-11. Post-IPO and divestment, the governments stake in the company will come down to 78.5 per cent from 98.13 per cent now.        
	The Centre had said it would sell stakes in Oil India, NHPC, Bharat Sanchar Nigam and Rites Ltd         
	In its interim budget, the government said it expected to generate Rs 1,120 crore in this fiscal from stake sales. It aims to sell 10-15 per cent in 18 state-run firms to bridge the fiscal deficit gap.

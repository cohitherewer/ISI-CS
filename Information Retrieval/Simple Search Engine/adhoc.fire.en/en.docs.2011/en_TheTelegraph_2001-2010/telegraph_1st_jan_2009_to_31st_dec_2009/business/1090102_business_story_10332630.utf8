The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Govt stance gives Satyam a headache
                                                                                                               Govt stance gives Satyam a headache
          JAYANTA ROY CHOWDHURY                          Raju: Rough ride                                  
	New Delhi, Jan. 1: Satyam Computer Services, the beleaguered infotech giant, may find itself mired in further trouble with the ministry of corporate affairs ready to take some action on the basis of a preliminary report on the Maytas fiasco.        
	The report on the countrys worst corporate governance scandal is likely to be submitted by mid-January.         
	On December 10, the Satyam board rubber-stamped a proposal moved by the Rajus, the companys promoters who have just an 8.6 per cent stake, to buy Maytas Infrastructure and Maytas Properties for $1.6 billion.         
	The Rajus, who control the two Maytas companies, were forced to abort the takeover after a shareholder revolt, orchestrated by institutional shareholders who have a combined stake of over 61 per cent.        
	Top officials in the ministry of corporate affairs said the report would examine corporate governance aspects of the aborted deal and decide whether any action needed to be taken.        
	The Satyam promoters had refused to seek shareholders approval for the takeover of the two companies, arguing that board approval was sufficient.        
	It later transpired that the Rajus had pledged their entire stake against loans. Several lenders sold the shares after the Rajus failed to meet margin calls arising from the slump in the market valuation of the pledged shares. The promoters holding is reported to have fallen to about 4 per cent after the share sale by the lenders.        
	One has to look at the web of shareholding in the Satyam-Maytas companies to see whether there is a clear violation of the law. It is a case of a related party transaction and there are provisions of law that deal with these things. Unless the shareholding structure is clearly understood, we cannot address all the issues that have been raised, said officials.        
	The scandal has tarnished Indias image among foreign investors and only deepened distrust about corporate governance standards in the country.        
	The officials said the ministry was not contemplating any immediate direct intervention in the affairs of the company.        
	Institutional investors do not want to remove the promoters from running the company. Nor do rival companies seem to wish to take over ... obviously there is a corporate logic for that, officials said.

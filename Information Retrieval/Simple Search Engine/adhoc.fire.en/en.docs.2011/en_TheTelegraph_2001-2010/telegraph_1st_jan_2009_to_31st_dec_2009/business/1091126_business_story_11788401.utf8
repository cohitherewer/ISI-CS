          OUR BUREAU                          D. Subbarao in Mumbai on Wednesday. (PTI)                                  
	Mumbai, Nov. 25: Bankers wear pin-striped suits, pore over ledgers and use a strange argot that no one really understands. They are conservative, risk-averse and hate any display of flamboyance.        
	That buttoned-up image of a typical banker is really a caricature; the latest financial crisis has shown that bankers can be just as greedy, risk-prone and reckless as high-rolling gamblers in a casino.        
	Paul Krugman, the Nobel-winning US economist, recently suggested that global banking needed to become boring once again to avoid the casino-style risk taking that had precipitated the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression of 1929.        
	However, RBI governor Duvvuri Subbarao today took a hard sideswipe at Krugman for suggesting that the only way to reform banking was to make it boring once again.        
	Subbarao also took a dig at the Bank of Englands governor Mervyn King and his own predecessor, Yaga Venugopal Reddy, for endorsing the view that bank street should be kept dull to keep the main street safe. Krugmans thesis was interesting but debatable and suggested that it was neither possible nor desirable to make banking boring. It is ridiculous to adopt Luddite solutions that take us back decades, he said.        
	Mervyn King came up with his own solution to the problem that arose when governments decided that financial institutions had become too important to fail. The BoE governor had suggested that banking ought to be restricted to its traditional utility function of deposit taking and lending and providing payment and settlement services. The riskier financial services such as proprietary trading could be spun off into a separate entity.        
	Subbarao poured scorn on Kings utility and casino model under which the utility would be heavily regulated and enjoy implicit government guarantees, while the casino would be disciplined by market forces.        
	The RBI governor said the narrow banking of the 1950s and 1960s was presumably safe and boring. It worked on a simple 3-6-3 formula: pay depositors 3 per cent interest, lend money at 6 per cent and head off to the golf course at 3 pm. From the 24/7/365 perspective of today, that may appear romantic but is hardly practical, he said.        
	The boring banking concept does not appear persuasive even going by more recent evidence. For starters, risky financial institutions such as Lehman Brothers had collapsed; but so did a traditional bank such as Northern Rock. What this demonstrates is that a business model distinction cannot be drawn between a utility and a casino, he said.        
	Second, he said, could a boring bank realistically ring-fence itself from what was happening around it? The collapse of a large investment bank  the casino  would cause a break down of trust not just in that bank but in the entire financial sector. So utilities cannot expect to insulate themselves against the risks being taken by the casinos.        
	Finally, he said, the coexistence of utilities and casinos could open up arbitrage opportunities.

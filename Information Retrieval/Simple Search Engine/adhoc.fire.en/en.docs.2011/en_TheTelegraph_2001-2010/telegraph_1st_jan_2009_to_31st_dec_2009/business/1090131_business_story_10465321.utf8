The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Hint of hope for Satyam suitor
                                                                                                               Hint of hope for Satyam suitor
          JAYANTA ROY CHOWDHURY                              
	New Delhi, Jan. 30: The government is working on ways to give immunity to the strategic investor in Satyam Computer.        
	Till such an entity provides funds to the beleaguered company, a clutch of state-run banks, which includes IDBI, will step in to offer the much-needed working capital.         
	The banks have been informally advised to help Satyam. The loans could be of short duration as the receivables are at around Rs 1,700 crore, of which at least Rs 1,500 crore is solid.         
	HDFC chairman Deepak Parekh is now on the board of Satyam and this has constrained HDFC Bank  Satyams lead banker, in which HDFC has a 12.34 per cent stake  from taking decisions on loans. ICICI Bank, BNP Paribas, and Citibank are among the other bankers of Satyam, which is on its knees since its founder B. Ramalinga Raju admitted to a Rs 7,100-crore fraud.        
	As strategic investors hover above the company, the problem for the successful bidder is of bearing the brunt of the class action lawsuits filed against Satyam in the US.         
	Officials said that after the immunity to the new Satyam directors, the government would now explore the options on immunity for the strategic investor. Legal experts will work out whether this can be done and how, they said.        
	Till now, Larsen amp; Toubro has trebled its stake in Satyam to 12 per cent. The engineering and construction giant, which has L amp;T Infotech as a subsidiary, maintains its motivation is to lower its average acquisition price.        
	However, many say it is a serious buyer and has sent feelers to the government for a possible management role.         
	Telecom firm Spice wants to pump $400 million into Satyam for a 51 per cent stake. Spice chairman B.K. Modi said here today that his group was keen to take control of Satyam.        
	US-based iGATE has also shown interest in buying Satyam with the help of private equity funds.

	New Delhi, Oct. 13: Swati Piramal, the newly elected president of Assocham, today asked the government to continue with its stimulus measures for two more years.         
	The stimulus has really worked well. The double-digit growth in industrial production reflects the impact of the measures and these should be continued for another 1-2 years, Piramal said.        
	Assocham will revise its earlier GDP estimate of 7 per cent for 2009-10 following the 10 per cent growth in factory output recorded in August.         
	I think IIP (index of industrial production) will continue to grow like this in the next two quarters also. We will revise (upwards) our economic growth estimates for 2009-10, she said.        
	The government had announced a slew of measures such as a cut in excise duties, additional spending in infrastructure, interest subsidies to exporters and service tax exemptions.        
	In the first quarter of the current fiscal, the economy grew 6.1 per cent. According to the governments estimates, it is expected to grow over 6 per cent in 2009-10.         
	Piramal said it was time for a quick divestment of profit-making public sector enterprises as it would immediately soften interest rates and assist in fiscal management.

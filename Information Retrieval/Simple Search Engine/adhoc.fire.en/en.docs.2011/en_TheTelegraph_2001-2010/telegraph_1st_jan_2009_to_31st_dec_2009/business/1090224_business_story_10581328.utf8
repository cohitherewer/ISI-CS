The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Posco to pick new boss for India
                                                                                                               Posco to pick new boss for India
                            
	Bhubaneswar, Feb. 23 (PTI): Soung Sik Cho, chairman and managing director of Posco-India, has left Orissa for Korea after a three-year stint with the company.        
	Cho, who on behalf of the company had signed the memorandum of understanding with the Orissa government on June 22, 2005, to set up a steel mill near Paradip, left the state yesterday, a company spokesperson said.        
	According to the spokesperson, Chos departure will in no way affect the companys project in India. The company is yet to name a new chairman, the spokesperson said.         
	The new CMD for Posco-India will be chosen at the board meeting in Korea on February 28, Posco-India general manager Saroj Mohapatra said.        
	Cho is also senior executive vice-president and a member of the Posco board.        
	Though construction work at the proposed plant could not materialise during Chos tenure, he was instrumental in obtaining the state governments recommendation for prospecting licence over the iron-rich Khandadhar reserves, despite opposition from different quarters.        
	Cho also helped the company get stage-I of the forest land diversion proposal clearance. During Chos tenure, violence at the proposed site delayed the implementation of the Rs 51,000-crore plant.        
	However, the situation had undergone a drastic change a few days before Chos departure.         
	The company had already undertaken socio-economic survey at the plant site and gained substantial support from the local people.

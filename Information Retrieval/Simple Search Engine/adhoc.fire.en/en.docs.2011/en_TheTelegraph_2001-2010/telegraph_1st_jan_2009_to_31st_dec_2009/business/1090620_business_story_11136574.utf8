          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Chidambaram in New Delhi on Friday. A Telegraph picture                                  
	New Delhi, June 19: Restrictions on sugar stocks will stay till January 8 amid fears of a looming shortage in the face of a production crunch and growing demand.        
	The cabinet today extended the cap on the quantity of sugar individual firms or traders can hold till January 8. The restriction was previously till July 9.        
	This is expected to help in the efforts to tackle the problem of rising sugar prices and also improve the availability of sugar, home minister P. Chidambaram said after the cabinet meeting.        
	In another measure to boost supply, the industry expects the government to allow private traders to import white sugar at zero duty and extend raw sugar import by mills without export obligation beyond July 31.         
	However, analysts said prices would continue to firm up, a view mirrored on the bourses.         
	Sugar stocks ran up impressive gains on the Bombay Stock Exchange. Saraswati Industrial Syndicate gained 17.86 per cent, Bajaj Hindustan, 6.39 per cent, Shree Renuka Sugars, 2.37 per cent, and Balrampur Chini Mills, 2.15 per cent, on a day when the sensex rose 256 points, or 1.80 per cent, to close at 14521.89.        
	Prices have risen over 25 per cent since October and are now trading between Rs 24 per kg and Rs 28 per kg. Traders expect the price to remain at that level as there are no fresh supplies.        
	From 26.3 million tonnes in 2007-08  the sugar season is from October to September  the output is expected to fall to 14.7mt in this year and is estimated at 20mt in 2009-10. The stocks of the commodity are estimated to hit a low of 2mt by October 1, 2009.        
	The government issued an order in March to check hoarding for four months. Under the stock-limit order, a dealer can stock up to 2,000 quintals, except in Calcutta, where the limit is 10,000 quintals. The limit is higher in Calcutta because it is the trading hub for eastern India as well as the Northeast. Besides, a trader has to sell the stocks within 30 days.         
	In February, the government allowed mills to import raw sugar at zero duty on the condition that they export an equal quantity of white sugar. The export obligation was waived in April. The government also asked three state-run firms to import up to 1 million tonnes of white sugar before July 31.        
	Jute support price        
	The cabinet committee on economic affairs today raised the minimum support price of jute by 10 per cent to Rs 1,375 per quintal for 2009-10 to encourage farmers to grow more.

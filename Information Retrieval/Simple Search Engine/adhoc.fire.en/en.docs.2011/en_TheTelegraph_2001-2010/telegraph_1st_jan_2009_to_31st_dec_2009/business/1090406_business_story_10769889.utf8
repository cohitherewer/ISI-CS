                                I had taken a loan from a relative to purchase my house. Can I claim income tax deduction on interest and principal repayment on the loan taken from an individual?          Sujit Mondal, Purulia
                    The deduction on interest payment on a housing loan is allowed irrespective of whom you have taken the loan from. However, you need to produce a certificate from the lender regarding the interest and the principal amount payable and paid. Section 24 does not prescribe that loan has to be borrowed from a financial institution or bank to claim the deduction. However, the section clearly mentions that no deduction shall be made unless the assessee furnishes a certificate from the person to whom any interest is payable on the capital borrowed, specifying the amount of interest payable by the assessee for the purpose of such acquisition.                                  Home truths      Can I claim income tax deductions on HRA and housing loan repayment together?        Prashanto Chakrabortty, Howrah
                    Yes, under certain circumstances, you can claim deductions on both HRA and repayment of a housing loan. For claiming exemption on HRA, one has to pay rent. Suppose, for employment reasons, you are living away from your home that you have purchased/built with a loan. Away from home, you may be staying in a rented house and drawing HRA from your office. The annual value of the property shall be taken as nil. You can claim deduction on both the interest and repayment of principal amount. If you have given the property on rent and you yourself are living in a rented accommodation, income from your house will be computed by the rental value minus the interest paid on the loan borrowed to build the house. Besides, you can also claim a deduction of 30 per cent on account of repair of the property. If the net income is positive, you shall have to pay income tax on that and if it is negative you dont have to pay any income tax. You can, however, claim deduction on the repayment of principal under Section 80C. You can also claim HRA exemption as you are paying rent.

	Calcutta, June 29: Jay Shree Tea amp; Industries, a BK Birla group firm, is looking for gardens in Uganda and Kenya.        
	We have appointed merchant bankers to identify gardens with 15-20 million kg annual production capacity, chairman B.K. Birla said on the sidelines of the companys annual general meeting today.        
	The merchant bankers, including ICICI Bank, have been asked to search for similar tea gardens in India as well.         
	There is hardly any offer in India. But if we get something that matches our requirements, we may go for it, Jay Shree Tea managing director D.P. Maheshwari said.         
	However, he did not say how much the company would spend on a possible buyout.        
	Jay Shree Tea is hopeful of its production increasing to 23 million kg this year from 21.80 million kg in 2008-09.         
	During the year, the company will buy 3-4 million kg of tea as well.        
	The company is also going ahead with its plans to produce organic tea but has decided to restrict itself to Darjeeling gardens because of high costs.        
	We have received certification for one garden and are close to getting clearance for two more. We trying to get organic status for another garden, Maheshwari said.        
	B.K. Birlas daughter Jayashree Mohta, who is the director of the company and expected to succeed Birla, said tea prices were likely to improve by another Rs 22 per kg during this year because of a global shortfall in production.        
	Global shortfall in crop was estimated at 77 million kg. In India, it is 25 million kg but will increase by another 5 million kg, Mohta said.        
	Fertiliser unit        
	On the chemicals and fertiliser business, Maheshwari said the unit would reopen in July.         
	It was closed in March this year because of a slump in price and demand.

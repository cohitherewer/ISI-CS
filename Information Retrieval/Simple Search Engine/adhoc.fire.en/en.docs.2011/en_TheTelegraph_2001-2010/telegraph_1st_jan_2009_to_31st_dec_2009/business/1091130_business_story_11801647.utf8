The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Liquidity prop for UAE banks
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Liquidity prop for UAE banks
          AGENCIES                          ACTION TIME                                  
	Dubai, Nov. 29: The United Arab Emirates central bank set up an emergency facility today to support bank liquidity in the first policy response to Dubais debt woes that threatened to paralyse lending and derail economic recovery.        
	The bank said it was making available to domestic and foreign banks a special additional liquidity facility linked to their current accounts at the central bank, at the rate of 50 basis points above the three months Emirates interbank offered rate.        
	Dubai rocked the financial world on November 25 when it said it would ask creditors of Dubai World  the conglomerate behind its rapid expansion  and Nakheel, builder of its palm-shaped islands, to agree to a standstill on billions of dollars of debt as a first step to restructuring.         
	As a result, banks face heavy losses and the risk that fearful depositors can rush to remove cash from the system.        
	The central banks move came late on Sunday as Dubais supreme fiscal committee gathered to prepare a statement to reassure investors. It might support the market a little bit but I dont think it is enough, said Shawkut Raslan, head of brokerage at Prime Emirates brokerage.        
	Dubai markets, which are set to open on Monday morning after a four-day holiday, are expected to fall by the maximum daily limit of 10 percent.        
	Dubai World is mulling over four options to repay its $59-billion debt. One of them is the on-schedule (December 14) repayment of $4 billion of a sukuk (Islamic bond) from Nakheel. Other options include a scheme to offer bondholders an 80 per cent redemption of the value of their holdings, with a similar offer being made to bankers.         
	Alternatively, it may move forward with the plan to seek a general debt holiday, by which payments would be frozen until May 30 next year with a view to negotiating a rescheduling of all its debts.        
	Lastly, Dubai World might embark on a general liquidation of assets in response to legal action by creditors.                                                                                                                                 
	But this is thought to be a remote possibility, as it is likely to impair the value of its assets, the report said.                                 
	It might support the market a little bit but I dont think it is enough, said Shawkut Raslan, head of brokerage at Prime Emirates brokerage.                                            
	If Dubai World pays back the sukuk, it would solve a problem for the company and its bondholders, and leave open the option of rescheduling bank debt and other liabilities, including bills owed to international contractors, the daily said.

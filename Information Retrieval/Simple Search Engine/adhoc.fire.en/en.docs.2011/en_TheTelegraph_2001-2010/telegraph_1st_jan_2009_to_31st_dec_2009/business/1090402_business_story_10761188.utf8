          OUR CORRESPONDENT                          Chandrasekhar: Action time                                  
	New Delhi, April 1: The government will meet the chiefs of public sector banks tomorrow and ask them to slash lending rates further and ensure credit growth.        
	As the bankers and cabinet secretary K.M. Chandrasekhar gear up for the key meeting, as many as 12 PSU banks have cut rates today.        
	However, the government wants banks to pare lending rates to single digits. Industry believes the governments wide range of sops can have the desired effect if they are complemented by rate cuts. At present, PNB charges the lowest rate at 11.5 per cent.         
	During his meeting with industrialists last Saturday, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh had observed that there was scope for further cuts in rates.        
	Bankers said they had taken all possible steps to reduce rates, but car and housing firms also needed to lower prices for the interest reliefs to be meaningful.        
	As many as eight banks  Canara Bank, Central Bank, Vijaya Bank, OBC, Union Bank, the Bank of Baroda, Uco Bank and Punjab amp; Sind Bank  reduced their prime lending rates (PLRs) by 50 basis points today.        
	Another four  Allahabad Bank, United Bank, Dena Bank and Andhra Bank  lowered their prime lending rates by 25 basis points.        
	All advances  auto, home, SME loans and other credits  linked to the PLRs of these banks would now carry less interest rates.         
	The State Bank of India had earlier reduced its benchmark lending rate by 150 basis points to 12.25 per cent from 13.75 per cent in October.         
	While public sector banks have responded well to the monetary policy measures initiated by the Reserve Bank of India to step up credit flow, foreign banks and private players have not been accommodative.        
	Among those to cut rates are ICICI Bank and Citi. The countrys largest private bank ICICI has reduced its PLR by 50 basis points to 16.75 per cent from 17.25 per cent. Citi yesterday cut its home loan rate by 50 basis points to 13.75 per cent.         
	Since October, the RBI has reduced the repo rate  the rate at which banks borrow from it  by 400 basis points to 5 per cent. It has, in phases, cut the reverse repo rate, or the rate at which it borrows from banks, by 250 basis points to 3.5 per cent. The cash reserve ratio, or the percentage of deposits that banks have to maintain with the RBI, has also been cut 400 basis points to 5 per cent to inject Rs 1,60,000 crore into the system.

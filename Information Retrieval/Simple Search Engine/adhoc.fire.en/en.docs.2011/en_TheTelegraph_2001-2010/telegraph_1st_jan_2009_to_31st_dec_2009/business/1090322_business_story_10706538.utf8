The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Neighbours ahead in mobile reach
                                                                                                               Neighbours ahead in mobile reach
          JAYATI GHOSE                          LONG WAY TO GO                                  
	New Delhi, March 21: India adds a record 15 million mobile connections almost every month, but it still lags behind countries such as Pakistan, China, South Africa and Sri Lanka in mobile coverage.         
	In 2007, only 61 per cent of the total population in India was connected by mobiles, compared with over 90 per cent in Pakistan, China, Sri Lanka, South Africa, the Philippines and Brazil, the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai) has said in a report.        
	We are the fastest while adding new connections, but there is a huge rural market which needs to be connected to increase our mobile penetration, Romal Shetty, telecom analyst at KPMG, told The Telegraph.        
	A report by the Indian Council for Research on International Economic Relations (ICRIER) on the impact of mobile phones also pointed out that Indias mobile penetration was lowest among countries that include China, Sri Lanka, Pakistan, Brazil and the Philippines.        
	Teledensity in India lags well behind most other countries at similar stages of development. China, Pakistan and Sri Lanka have achieved mobile coverage of 77 per cent, 60 per cent and 61 per cent, respectively, said Rajiv Kumar, director and chief executive of ICRIER.         
	Mobile teledensity in India is around 20 per cent.        
	The report said radio spectrum policy, licence fees and the universal service obligation need to be reformed to improve teledensity.         
	The universal service obligation is an initiative aimed at expanding the phone network to rural areas where customers may not be able to afford phone services.        
	Shetty added there was huge untapped potential in certain states  in rural areas and increasingly in poor urban areas. There is an urgent need to bridge the gaps to increase our coverage.

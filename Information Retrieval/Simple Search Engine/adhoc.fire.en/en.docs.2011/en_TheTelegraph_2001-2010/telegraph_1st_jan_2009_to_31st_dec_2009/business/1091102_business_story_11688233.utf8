The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Britannia workers seek Mamata help in rent row
                                                                                                               Britannia workers seek Mamata help in rent row
          SOUNAK MITRA AMP; SAMBIT SAHA                              
	Calcutta, Nov. 1: The workers union at Britannia Industries Ltd has sought the intervention of railway minister Mamata Banerjee and Union minister of state for shipping Mukul Roy in restraining the Calcutta Port Trust (CPT) from evicting the company from the ports Taratala land.        
	On October 15, the CPT in an eviction notice had asked Britannia to vacate the Taratala premises, which the confectionery giant has been occupying since Independence.        
	In a letter to both Mamata and Roy, the union leaders have appealed to them to consider our grave situation in a sympathetic view and intervene in the matter so that the Calcutta Port Trust may restrain from taking any step on the basis of the notice. The Telegraph has a copy of the letter.        
	Roy, who keeps a close watch on the CPT, said: I am yet to receive the letter. However, I will definitely look into the matter since the workers future is involved. The company should pay up. The port needs to be lenient.        
	The union leaders said they had handed over the letter to both Mamata and Roy last week. In the past, before its poll defeats at the hands of Trinamul, the Left usually took up the cudgels for workers.         
	We fear to lose jobs and have conveyed the same to Mamata didi. She assured us that she would look into the matter, a union leader, who did not wish to be named, said.        
	The eviction notice said: M/S. Britannia Industries of 15 Taratala Road, Calcutta  700 088 and all persons who may be in occupation of the same premises or any part thereof to vacate the same premises within 15 days of the date of publication of this order.        
	 Britannia and all other persons concerned are liable to be evicted from the premises, if need be, by the use of force.        
	The Telegraph broke the story on October 22.        
	The order from the port estate officer, who has a quasi-judicial role, appears to offer Britannia two options  pay up or vacate.         
	If Britannia wants to continue to do business from the plot, it has to pay up the dues and enter into a fresh lease agreement with the port, which may or may not oblige.         
	Even if the port agreed to retain the plot for Britannia, the new lease terms could involve higher rents. However, port sources indicated that its trustees might take a lenient view if Britannia paid its dues.        
	Case status        
	Britannia Industries had moved Alipore Judges Court seeking a stay order against the eviction notice. The first hearing on the plea took place on October 30.        
	The next hearing will take place on December 1, a source aware of the development told The Telegraph.         
	Till the next hearing, the CPT is unlikely to take any action, he said. A CPT official said the authority would follow the usual procedure.

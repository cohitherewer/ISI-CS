The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Exports dip, trade gap widens
                                                                                                               Exports dip, trade gap widens

	New Delhi, Feb. 2: Trade deficit has shot up 31.5 per cent in April-December 2008, sparking concern but a marginal decline of 1.1 per cent in December exports provided some respite.        
	Though exports fell for the third straight month in December, the decline was not as sharp as in October (-12.1 per cent) and November (-9.9 per cent).        
	However, commerce ministry officials said initial estimate suggested exports in January had fallen 10-20 per cent because of the recession in the US and Europe.        
	Imports in April-December were $225.8 billion, a rise of 31.5 per cent from $171.7 billion in the same period of 2007.        
	The widening trade deficit is a cause for concern as it will put pressure on the current account deficit. However, with the slump in global crude prices, the gap between export and import will narrow down by the end of this fiscal, N. R. Bhanumurthy of the Institute of Economic Growth said.        
	Exports dropped to $12.6 billion in December from $12.8 billion a year ago. A sharp correction in crude oil price led to imports growing a modest 8.8 per cent to $20.2 billion in December.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Tea exports drop 14%
                                                                                                               Tea exports drop 14%
          A STAFF REPORTER                          HARD TIMES                                  
	Calcutta, Oct. 10: Tea exports declined 14 per cent during January-August to 112.8 million kg from 130.7 million kg reported in the same period last year.        
	Lower output because of a severe draught earlier this year affected the industry, a Tea Board official said.         
	In value terms, exports increased to Rs 1,518.81 crore in January-August from Rs 1,423.05 crore in the same period last year. Rise in internal consumption has pushed up prices to Rs 134.7 per kg during the first eight months from Rs 108.86 per kg in the corresponding period last year.        
	Production during January-August fell 0.73 per cent to 595.3 million kg, but it rose 9 per cent to 134.4 million kg in August compared with the year-ago period.        
	India exports mainly CTC tea to Egypt, Pakistan and the UK and the premium orthodox to Iraq, Iran and Russia.        
	Output in drought-hit Assam, which accounts for over half of the countrys total tea production, rose by over five million kg in August to 82.92 million kg. Late showers in some areas also improved the prospects of the crop.        
	Higher production in southern states like Tamil Nadu, Kerala and Karnataka also contributed to the rise.        
	According to the Tea Board statistics, the import bill has surged by Rs 35 crore this year. Total import last year was Rs 75 crore; this year it has shot up 46 per cent to Rs 110 crore.        
	Import volumes have gone up to 13.2 million kg in the first seven months of 2009, which was 10.3 million kg in 2008.         
	Globally, there has been a shortage in production that led to the price hike. Countries like the UK, Russia and the US are not ready to lower the prices in the wake of the global economic crisis. So, India continues to import cheap tea and export it after mixing it with the Indian tea.

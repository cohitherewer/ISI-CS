	New Delhi, March 16: Cigarette-to-hotels conglomerate ITC is planning to bring three heritage properties into its fold this week as the slowdown engulfs tourism.        
	ITC WelcomHeritage, a joint venture between Calcutta-based ITC and Marudhar Hotels of Jodhpur, will sign agreements for Shivavilas Palace at Hampi, Karnataka; the Sirsi haveli in Jaipur; and the Naukuchiatal resort near Nainital, Uttarakhand.        
	Many chains believe the time is ripe for buying or leasing properties because the slowdown has diminished valuations.        
	In November, ITC WelcomHeritage had signed agreements for six properties. Sources say the chain has lined up more such properties.        
	Our selection of properties is based primarily on location. A property must either be in a tourist destination or must form part of a travel circuit, a spokesperson for the company said.        
	Shivavilas Palace near the monuments of Hampi is a two-storied structure housing 10 suites. Currently undergoing renovation, it will offer 18 rooms and suites from September.         
	The Sirsi haveli is on the outskirts of Jaipur, located about 25km from the airport and on the route from Jaipur to Pushkar and Ajmer. It is more than 100-year old and has 15 rooms.         
	The haveli is being restored and expected to open by September.         
	The Naukuchiatal resort is being developed as a nature property and will be launched in a year. It will have 15 cottages.         
	ITC WelcomHeritage has seen a slowdown in foreign tourists in the last couple of months.        
	A company official said though the number of foreigners were down, there had been an increase in the number of domestic travellers.        
	With the three properties, the chain will have 64 properties in 19 states of the country.        
	Foreign tourists are coming less since the Mumbai terror attacks and the onset of the recession. The Indian government has launched Visit India Year 2009 to woo them back.         
	Overall, in 2008, there has been a 6 per cent increase in foreign tourist arrivals at 5.8 million.

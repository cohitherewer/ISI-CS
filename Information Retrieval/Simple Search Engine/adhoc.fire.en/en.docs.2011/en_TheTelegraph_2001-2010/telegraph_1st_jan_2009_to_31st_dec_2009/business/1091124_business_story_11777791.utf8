                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Fresh Sebi notice to RIL 
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Mumbai, Nov. 23: The Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) has shot off a second showcause notice to Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL) asking why the oil giant shouldnt be barred from accessing the securities market because of an insider trading charge that dates back to 2007.        
	The showcause follows an investigation into the charges of insider trading in the securities of group firm Reliance Petroleum Ltd (RPL).         
	In November 2007, RIL had sold over 4 per cent in RPL for Rs 4,032 crore. The Mukesh Ambani-owned company had then claimed that it sold the shares to increase RPLs floating stock, and thus arrest the volatility in its stock price.        
	RPL was then a subsidiary of RIL. It has since been merged with RIL.        
	However, before the stake sale in 2007, it was alleged that various RIL group entities had been involved in heavy selling in the futures contract of RPL.        
	This prompted the market regulator to issue the first showcause notice to RIL in late April 2008. Sebi was then understood to have asked RIL and its dozen associate entities why action should not be taken against them under the Sebi act and the prohibition of fraudulent and unfair trade practice regulation.        
	Although Sebi officials refrained from making any comments on the fresh showcause notice, it was learnt that the notice was issued in the second week of this month.         
	It is speculated that while Sebi has asked RIL to appear in the hearings relating to the insider trading charges, the company has not attended these hearings last year.        
	In its fresh amended notice sent this month, the market regulator has asked RIL to explain why it should not be barred from accessing the market, directly or indirectly, and why a direction should not be issued for the disgorgement of proceeds from the sale of RPL shares.        
	The notice was issued under Section 11 and 11B of the Sebi Act and Regulation 11 of prohibition of fraudulent and unfair trade practice regulation.        
	According to Sebi, RIL made a profit of around Rs 513 crore from the sale of 4 per cent in RPL.        
	Reacting to the development, a Reliance spokesperson said the company had always abided by all rules and regulations of Sebi and, hence, has neither violated any provisions of insider trading nor has acted in any manner so as to attract provisions under Section 11(i), 11 (B) and 11(4) of Sebi Act 1992.        
	He added that RIL had submitted its detailed reply to Sebi and not received any further communication.

                                                                                                               Capgemini on a hiring spree 
          SOUNAK MITRA                          Recruitment drive                                  
	Calcutta, Sept. 26: French IT giant Capgemini is in a hiring mode in India.        
	We are hiring and the number will be significant this year, Anish Sarkar, Capgemini India vice-president (head of sales), told The Telegraph.         
	Capgemini recruited 5,586 people in the first six months of this year. The company had earlier said it would ship more jobs to cheaper locations such as India to trim costs.        
	A company source said the hiring would be around 100-150 per month for the next two quarters.        
	The companys Calcutta office is spread over 1,75,000 square feet and the current headcount stands at around 1,000.         
	We have space for about 1,000 more and hiring would happen accordingly, Sarkar said.        
	Capgemini plans to increase its headcount in the country by 10 to 15 per cent in 2010.         
	The company has 21,000 employees in the country to provide outsourcing services to global customers, making the country its largest location in terms of headcount and accounting for a fifth of its global workforce of about 90,000.        
	Capgemini has six offices in Mumbai, Bangalore, Calcutta, Pune, Hyderabad and Chennai. It also has a satellite office in New Delhi.         
	Capgemini is focusing on sectors such as consumer products, retail, telecom, media and entertainment.         
	We are also looking at manufacturing, energy and utilities. There is also a good demand for outsourcing jobs in application and maintenance, Sarkar said. Government projects would be another thrust area for the company.         
	Earlier in July, Capgemini had reduced its 2009 sales outlook, saying it was doubtful whether the signs of stability in some regions would translate into a full-blown recovery for the battered technology sector.         
	However, the company also said it was trying to grow outside the core developed markets such as Europe and North America and the focus for growth would be the Asia Pacific region.        
	ID project        
	The French firm is keen to join the Centres Unique Identification Database programme.        
	We had worked for similar projects in Europe and we have strong credentials. Prior experiences would be useful here, Sarkar said.         
	The company is waiting for the government to get ready with the fine print of how the project would be undertaken, he said.

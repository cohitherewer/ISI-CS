The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | PAN is must
                                                                                                                 Q amp;A      PAN is must
                                I am a pensioner and I dont have a PAN card. I have some FDs with the SBI. My total income, including the interest on FDs, is below the current taxable limit. My bank is insisting me to quote PAN on Form 15G even though I have declared that my total income from all sources is below the taxable limit. Is the SBI right to insist on quoting the PAN on 15G?          T. Chowdhury, Basirhat
                You can get a PAN even if you dont have taxable income. PAN is mandatory for some high-value transactions, such as sale of shares and houses. The bank was right in insisting on PAN. Having a PAN doesnt mean that you have to file income tax return.                                  Fixed on FDs      I am 68-years-old. I have a PPF account for more than 20 years. The PPF amount stands at Rs 6.5 lakh. I want to close the account and invest the amount in a bank fixed deposit. What is the maximum amount I can invest in an FD without attracting any tax deduction (the rate of interest is 10.75 per cent)? I have an annual income of Rs 1,77,000.        N. Dhar, Calcutta
                    You will have to include the interest from the FD to calculate your taxable income. The basic exemption limit for senior citizens if Rs 2,25,000. You can still have another annual interest income of Rs 48,000 from investments in FDs. Interest on FDs is quarterly compounded. This means that the interest rate of 10.75 per cent will compound to 11.19 per cent. At this rate of interest, you can invest a maximum of Rs 4,28,954 to earn an annual interest of Rs 48,000. But, every year, you will have to submit Form 15G with the bank                                  Share transfer      My son will get a few shares of a blue-chip company under the employee stock option scheme. I want to gift him the money required to buy the shares. If my son transfers these shares to my demat account one year after the allotment, what will be the tax implication?         Narendra Lal Kundu, Hooghly
                    Since the shares are transferred through an off-market deal, it will attract long-term capital gains tax.

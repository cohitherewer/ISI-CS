          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                        Maheshwari: Growth plans				                                 
	Calcutta, Nov. 14: ArcelorMittal today said it was exploring alternative sites for its two greenfield plants in India.         
	The company is scouting for new sites within Jharkhand and Orissa and in other states as well.        
	ArcelorMittal had earlier promised $20 billion to build two 12-million-tonne plants in Jharkhand and Orissa but slow land acquisition had delayed the process.        
	Sudhir Maheshwari, member of the group management board of the company, said: India is at the very core of our growth strategy and there was no question of pulling out.        
	However, he warned that even as India was the most promising market, there were obstacles which could hurt the speed at which, or the extent to which, India reached the full extent of that promise.         
	Steel companies have pledged billions of dollars to expand in India but they are struggling to secure land, he said. Maheshwari was speaking at the National Metallurgists Day organised by the Indian Institute of Metals.        
	New world order        
	Maheshwari, who also looks after corporate finance, risk management and business development (including India) in ArcelorMittal, said the worst was over for the steel industry and his company had emerged stronger during the period than before.        
	Emerging countries such as India, Brazil and China strengthened its position in the global economy and ArcelorMittal is focusing on those markets too.

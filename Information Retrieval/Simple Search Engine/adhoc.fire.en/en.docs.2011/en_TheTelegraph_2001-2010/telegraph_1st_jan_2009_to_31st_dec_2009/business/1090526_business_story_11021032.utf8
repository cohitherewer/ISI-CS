                                                                                                               Jet suffers Rs 402cr yearly loss
          OUR BUREAU                          Rough landing                                  
	Mumbai, May 25: Jet Airways has suffered a net loss of Rs 402.34 crore for the year ended March 31 even after rejigging the way it calculated the depreciation on its narrow-bodied planes  the second time it has done so this year.        
	The airline posted a consolidated loss of Rs 961.4 crore for the year when taking into account the operations of JetLite, its fully owned low-cost carrier. Last year, it had reported a consolidated loss of Rs 653.87 crore.        
	Jet Airways reported a standalone net income of Rs 11,083.43 crore, a 27.8 per cent rise over last years income of Rs 8,669.28 crore.        
	The airline switched back to a straight-line method of calculating depreciation on narrow body aircraft from the written-down value method. The airline had adopted the written-down method in the first quarter ended June 30.        
	The change in the depreciation method  which was done with retrospective effect from April 1, 2008  meant that the provision for depreciation was lower by Rs 129.97 crore for the whole year.        
	The airline reported a fourth-quarter profit of Rs 52.99 crore against a loss of Rs 221.18 crore in the year-ago period.         
	Two factors were responsible for the turnaround in the fourth quarter: first, the change in the depreciation method meant that it had to make a lower provision of Rs 20.59 crore during the quarter.         
	Second, it took into account a Cenvat credit of Rs 349.93 crore. The accumulated Cenvat credit can be utilised for the payment of output service tax without any restriction of time limit, the company said.        
	Aircraft fuel expenses fell to 24.7 per cent of its overall expenditure in the fourth quarter against 36.7 per cent in the year ago period  an indication of the benefits of route rationalisation and the cut in aviation turbine fuel price towards the latter part of the year.        
	The company incurred aircraft fuel expenses of Rs 593.94 crore in the fourth quarter against Rs 1,080.21 crore in the year-ago period. However, fuel costs for the full year rose 43.8 per cent to Rs 5,853.55 crore from Rs 4,069.98 crore in the year ended March 2008.        
	The company suffered losses mainly on account of high fuel and other operating costs and lower load factors resulting in lower revenues than expected, the company said.

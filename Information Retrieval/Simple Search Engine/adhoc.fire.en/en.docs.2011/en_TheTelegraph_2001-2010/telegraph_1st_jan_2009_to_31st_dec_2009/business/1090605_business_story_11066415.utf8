                                                                                                               Tata electric car by Sept
                            
	New York, June 4 (PTI): Tata Motors will have an electric car in the market by September this year, group chairman Ratan Tata was quoted as saying by Cornell University on its micro-blogging feed Twitter.         
	Tata is also a Cornell trustee. He talked about the car at the Cornell global forum on sustainable global enterprise organised by the university.        
	In 2008, Tata, speaking at the annual general meeting of Tata Motors, had said the company was developing an electric car.        
	Foreign media also reported that the Nano was expected to be available in the US in the next two years.        
	The much awaited Nano was commercially launched in March in India and is expected to hit the roads soon.

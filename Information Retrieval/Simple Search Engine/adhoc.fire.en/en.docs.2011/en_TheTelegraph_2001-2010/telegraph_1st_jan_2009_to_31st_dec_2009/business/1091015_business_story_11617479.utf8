                                                                                                               Patel sets terms for AI capital infusion
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Civil aviation minister Praful Patel with Air India chairman Arvind Jadhav in Mumbai on Wednesday. (PTI)                                  
	Mumbai, Oct. 14: Civil aviation minister Praful Patel today said the government would make a capital infusion of Rs 5,000 crore in Air India if the employees of the troubled state-owned carrier were ready to make sacrifices as well.        
	He said the cash-strapped airline would have to trim costs by Rs 3,000 crore and raise its revenues by Rs 2,000 crore over the next two years.        
	A draft note on equity infusion in Air India, prepared by the civil aviation ministry, is being sent to the cabinet committee on economic affairs, the minister said.        
	Patel met the management and the various unions to review the turnaround plan of the airline, which ran up losses of Rs 7,200 crore in the year to March 31.        
	The Air India employees have shown a lot of understanding, Patel said. The management and the unions can forge a way forward.        
	The minister said the unions were scheduled to hold further talks with the management tomorrow.        
	Patels announcement comes just two weeks after executive pilots of Air India had struck work and gone on mass sick leave protesting cuts in their productivity-linked allowances.        
	The national carrier is looking to retire its ageing fleet of leased aircraft over the next 12-24 months. It also plans to lease out some new ones.        
	Patel said the airline had decided to defer delivery of six Boeing 777 aircraft by two years.         
	He said a few Boeing 777s (Long Range), which were due to be inducted into the fleet in the next few months, could be leased out. He said the airline would explore the feasibility of adopting a sale and lease back policy for aircraft, adopting a strategy that private airlines had used to trim their costs.         
	Air traffic has improved over the last six months, Patel said.

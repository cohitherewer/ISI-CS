          DAVID E. SANGER, JEFF ZELENY AMP; BILL VLASIC                                                               
	Detroit/Washington, June 1: General Motors filed for bankruptcy on Monday morning, submitting its reorganisation papers to a federal clerk in Lower Manhattan in a move that President Barack Obama said marked the end of an old General Motors and the beginning of a new General Motors.        
	The bankruptcy of a once-proud auto giant that helped to define the nations car culture and played a part in creating the American middle class immediately rippled across the country, part of a process that the President said would take a painful toll on many Americans but lead ultimately to a strong company ready to compete in the 21st century.         
	But for the moment, auto workers braced for news about their jobs as GM said it would shutter plants in Michigan, Indiana, Ohio and Delaware, and plants in Tennessee and elsewhere in Michigan were put on standby. In the financial markets, shares of foreign auto makers and Ford surged ahead.         
	In its bankruptcy petition, GM said it had $82.3 billion in assets and $172.8 billion in debts. Its largest creditors were the Wilmington Trust Company, representing a group of bondholders holding $22.8 billion in debts, and affiliates of the United Auto Workers union, representing nearly $20.6 billion in employee obligations.        
	In a court affidavit, Fritz Henderson, GMs chief executive, said bankruptcy and a US treasury-sponsored sale of General Motors assets to a so-called New GM were the auto makers only option to move forward. Failing that, he said, the company faced liquidation.        
	There is no other sale, or even other potential purchasers, present or on the horizon, Henderson said.         
	In a bit of good news, GM said it planned to keep its international headquarters in downtown Detroit, rather than move to the suburbs. It said it responded to concerns by city officials fearful of losing the only one of the Detroit companies to be based in the Motor City.        
	Quick action        
	With the filing, GM follows its crosstown rival Chrysler in bankruptcy. And GM hopes that it can move as swiftly in its reorganisation.         
	Chrysler, which sought court protection on April 30, could emerge in the next few days. A bankruptcy judge in New York gave approval on Sunday night for most of its assets to be acquired by Fiat, a decision that President Obama hailed on Monday morning.        
	The bankruptcy of General Motors culminates a remarkable four months of confrontation between Washington and Detroit that is expected to result in a drastic downsizing of the company. It also places the government in uncharted territory as a business owner, as it takes a majority ownership stake in the company during its restructuring.        
	The companys Saturn unit, which GM began in 1990 to compete with foreign-made cars, also filed for bankruptcy on Monday. GM has said it will phase out the Saturn brand by 2012.        
	GMs Saab unit is already under bankruptcy protection in Sweden. The German government last week picked Magna International, a Canadian car-parts maker, to buy GMs Opel unit, which is based in Germany.        
	Reflecting the governments extraordinary intervention in industry, aides say, Obama reiterated his hope that GM can be brought back from the brink of insolvency, even if the company looks almost nothing like the titan of old.        
	The new GM will be leaner and better run and its cars more fuel efficient, the President said, in yet another acknowledgement that the days of high-finned gas-guzzlers are gone forever.        
	Shutdown, layoff        
	The company will also have to shed 21,000 union workers and close 12 to 20 factories, steps that most analysts thought could never be pushed through by a Democratic president allied with organised labour.        
	Forty per cent of the companys 6,000 dealers will close, the workers union will be forced to finance half of its $20-billion health care fund with stock of uncertain value in the restructured GM, and bondholders, including many retirees, will be forced to take stock worth 10 cents for every dollar they lent the company.        
	GM will also lose its spot on the Dow Jones industrial average, a key stock-market gauge of 30 blue-chip stocks. The car maker had been a member of the closely watched stock index since 1925.        
	Judge Robert E. Gerber of the United States Bankruptcy Court in Manhattan will oversee the bankruptcy.        
	To assist in the restructuring, the auto maker is expected to hire the consulting firm Alix Partners, which has worked on several major bankruptcies, including those for Enron and Kmart.                                 
	One of the firms partners, Al Koch, is expected to manage the liquidation of corporate assets that GM will shed during its Chapter 11 restructuring, people with knowledge of the bankruptcy strategy said.                    
	Administration officials briefed reporters on Sunday night, as President Obama began to inform members of Congress. But the White House insisted that the aides who talked to reporters could not be named.                          
	He was appointed in 2000, and oversaw the bankruptcy of the cable company Adelphia.        
	Before that, he was a partner in the Manhattan firm of Fried, Frank, Harris, Shriver amp; Jacobson, which he joined in 1971 after graduating for Columbia Law School. He specialized in securities and commercial litigation and, thereafter, bankruptcy litigation and counseling.        
	The companys last steps toward bankruptcy took place over the weekend as a majority of G.M. bondholders agreed not to challenge the filing in court and to exchange their debt for stock.

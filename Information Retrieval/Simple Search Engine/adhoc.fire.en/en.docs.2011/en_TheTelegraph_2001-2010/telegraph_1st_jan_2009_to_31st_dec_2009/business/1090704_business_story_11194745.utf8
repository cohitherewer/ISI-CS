          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Calcutta, July 3: Private wagon manufacturers are eager to participate in the revival of Burn Standard.        
	Railway minister Mamata Banerjee today outlined her ministrys intention to take over the wagon manufacturing facility of the ailing public sector company.         
	Ramesh Maheshwari, president and CEO of Texmaco, said the public-private-partnership (PPP) model should apply for Burn Standard.        
	The railways should adopt the PPP route for such projects and provide an opportunity to the leading private companies with proven track record to restructure these units in co-operation with the railways. These ailing companies would not only require the infusion of capital but also strong management, he said.        
	Maheshwari said the railways should not saddle themselves with the burden of running the ailing units.         
	Instead, they should focus themselves in strengthening infrastructure.        
	Wagon manufacturers such as Titagarh Wagons and Jessop have been buoyed by Mamatas intention of setting up a coach unit at Kanchrapara, Bengal, in a collaboration with private parties.        
	Pawan Ruia, chairman of Jessop, said his company would be keen to share its experience with the railways.        
	Jessop has been manufacturing EMU coaches for the railways for years, Ruia said.        
	This years budget has proposed the acquisition of 18,000 wagons in 2009-10 compared with 11,000 last year.        
	Umesh Chowdhary, chairman and managing director of Titagarh Wagons, said the Indian wagon industry was fully geared up to meet the extra demand.         
	However, he suggested some changes in the way wagon orders were placed to meet the procurement target at the end of the year.

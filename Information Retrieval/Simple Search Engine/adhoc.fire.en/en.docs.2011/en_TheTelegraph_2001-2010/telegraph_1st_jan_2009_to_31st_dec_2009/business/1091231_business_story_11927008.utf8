	New Delhi, Dec. 30: Recession and terrorist scares have brought down tourist arrivals to India by 6.3 per cent for the first 11 months of this year. Foreign exchange earnings, however, went up 5 per cent.        
	The cumulative arrival figures for January to November was 4.54 million. Forex earnings from tourism were Rs 47,918 crore during the same period. This is an increase of 5 per cent over the corresponding period in 2008, the ministry of tourism said in its review report released today.         
	The government has attributed the drop in tourist arrivals to the global economic slowdown, terrorist scares and the H1N1 influenza pandemic.        
	Arrivals from countries such as the US, the UK, Canada, France, Germany and Japan were down.         
	The ministry said the government had made an effort to develop infrastructure at various circuits in the country this year.         
	The tourism ministry had sanctioned 94 projects for an amount of Rs 394.85 crore for infrastructure development, including rural tourism projects in 2009-10.         
	The ministry also launched a scheme for the development of nationally and internationally important destinations and circuits through mega projects.

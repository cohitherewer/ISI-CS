          GARIMA SINGH NEOGY                          Growth push                                  
	New Delhi, May 3: Hopes of a healthy rise in demand have spurred consumer durables firms such as LG, Samsung and Godrej to infuse fresh capital into the Indian market.         
	Each of these companies are investing between Rs 80 crore and Rs 100 crore.        
	Despite the slowdown in sales in most sectors in the last six months, our industry has recorded strong growth in both consumer electronics and home appliances. A strong demand will emerge in the coming season as well. A lot of contribution is anticipated from the rural market, said V. Ramachandran, director (sales and marketing), LG Electronics India.        
	During the last fiscal, the industry saw a growth rate of 17-20 per cent in the home appliances category, while consumer electronics grew between 12 and 15 per cent.         
	LG said it was investing in customising products for India, which would help them tap various segments and ensure better profitability. Some of its washing machines will be equipped with speech technology, which will guide users in Hindi and English.         
	Samsung, too, has planned an investment of Rs 100 crore to increase the capacity of its Noida facility. The company is looking to strengthen its portfolio with a new range of air conditioners, refrigerators and washing machines.        
	Homegrown Godrej Appliances has earmarked an investment of Rs 100 in the current fiscal to expand the capacity of its five manufacturing plants.        
	We will invest around Rs 100 crore in our plants at Punjab, Maharashtra and Uttaranchal. The funding will be through internal accruals, said George Menezes, chief operating officer (appliance division), Godrej amp; Boyce Manufacturing Company.

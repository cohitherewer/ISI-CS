                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Jindals, JFE in equity-swap pact
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                            
	Mumbai, Nov. 19: JFE Steel Corporation of Japan, the worlds sixth largest steel maker, and the Jindals-owned JSW Steel today agreed on a strategic arrangement under which the two entities will consider picking up equity stakes in each other.        
	The two steel giants also decided to collaborate in the manufacture of auto grade steel in India at a time when the demand for cars has started surging in the worlds second-fastest growing economy.        
	Two task forces have been formed to work out the details of the equity cross-holdings and investments in the automotive steel project.        
	Senior officials on both sides told reporters here today that they intended to hammer out the nitty-gritty of their strategic arrangement as quickly as possible.        
	The buzz on the street is that JFE  the second largest steel maker in Japan  is likely to pick up a 10 per cent stake in JSW Steel for Rs 1,500 crore.        
	Sajjan Jindal, vice-chairman and managing director of JSW Steel, refused to divulge any details, saying that these aspects would be decided after detailed discussions between the partners.        
	The option of mutual shareholding is part of our larger discussion, which will evolve over time, Jindal said after the two companies announced their strategic collaboration.        
	Both companies agreed in-principle to collaborate with each other in India in the area of automotive steel, including production technologies and supply of substrate materials for hot rolled, cold rolled and galvanised products.        
	JFE is the third big Japanese corporation to come to India in recent times after Daiichi Sankyo acquired a controlling interest in Ranbaxy in 2008 and NTT DoCoMo picked up a 25 per cent holding in Tata Teleservices.        
	The scope of the arrangement with JSW also covers joint service activities, including application engineering and product development for automotive customers.        
	The areas of collaboration include production of steel products other than automotive steel, energy reduction programmes, environmental programmes and procurement of raw materials both within India and overseas.        
	JFE Steel Corps chief executive officer Hajime Bada said his company was considering a variety of investment options. We are exploring the possibility of (investing in) many activities. We havent come up with the exact number of investments in India, he added.        
	Seshagiri Rao, JSWs group chief financial officer, said there was huge potential in the automotive steel segment as the automobile industry was growing at 20 to 25 per cent.        
	He added that out of the 4.1 million tonnes of cold rolled steel sold in India, close to 1.9 million tonnes was used by the automobile industry. Almost 15 per cent of JSW Steels total sales are to the auto sector.        
	Steel companies in India largely supply inner panels to car makers. However, Rao said it was the outer panels that provided better margins. JSW Steel will be harnessing JFEs technology in order to focus on this area.        
	The JSW Steel stock surged in early deals amid talk that the Japanese giant would pick up a stake in the Indian entity. But with no sign of specifics, the stock fell Rs 6.30 to Rs 959.35 on the Bombay Stock Exchange after it surged to an intra-day peak of Rs 1039.        
	Shares in JFE, valued at $20.4 billion, ended down 2.9 per cent in a Tokyo market that fell 1.3 per cent. The tie-up was announced after the market had closed.

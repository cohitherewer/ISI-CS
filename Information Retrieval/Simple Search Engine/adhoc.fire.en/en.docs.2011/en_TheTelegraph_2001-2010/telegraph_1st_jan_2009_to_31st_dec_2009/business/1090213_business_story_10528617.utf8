The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Sudden fare hike hits monopoly air pocket
                                                                                                               Sudden fare hike hits monopoly air pocket
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                          BUMPY RIDE                                
	New Delhi, Feb. 12: MRTPC, the anti-monopoly watchdog, today ordered a probe into the sudden hike in airfares and withdrawal of promotional fares by airlines in unison.        
	The probe has been ordered under two sections of the Monopolies and Restrictive Trade Practices Commission (MRTPC) Act, which relates to reduction in competition and simultaneous increase in prices.    
	The commissions move comes soon after the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) directed the airlines to provide a justification for their decision to simultaneously raise prices.         
	The Directorate General of Investigation and Registration (DGIR), a wing of the watchdog, has been asked to submit its report within 60 days.        
	The decision to raise fares by major airlines will narrow down the choice for consumers.        
	The simultaneous announcements by Jet Airways, Kingfisher, Air India, SpiceJet and IndiGo to raise fares this week have raised suspicion that these airlines may have colluded to fix prices.         
	Some airlines, however, brought back the low fares, in a selective manner, following a government threat.         
	Last year, the cement industry faced similar allegations of price fixing.        
	Earlier, the civil aviation ministry had announced a probe. Suspicions emerged after some airlines withdrew their low-end fares.        
	We will keep a watch and take strict action in any such case, civil aviation minister Praful Patel said yesterday. He had earlier asked carriers to reduce fares after a fall in jet fuel price.        
	The DGCA wrote letters to all scheduled domestic carriers asking for information on the recent hike and transparency in airfare advertising, saying it should be furnished by Saturday.        
	The regulatory body said the carriers had increased their airfares simultaneously in the second week of February and the DGCA was not aware of the reasons for this simultaneous hike, specifically at a time when ATF prices, effective February 1, 2009, are at the level that they were in 2005.        
	DGCA feels there is no rationale for increasing the airfares, an official spokesperson said.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                            
	Mumbai, Aug. 25: Talks between liquor baron Vijay Mallya and Diageo  the worlds largest beer, wine and spirits company  to forge a strategic alliance in India have floundered.        
	Sources close to the development said the almost year-long talks had collapsed over issues of control.        
	Diageo was supposed to pick up a strategic stake in Mallya- controlled United Spirits Ltd. The London-based company  famous for brands such as Johnnie Walker, Guinness, Baileys and Smirnoff  was insisting on a substantial stake in the flagship of Mallyas empire. It (Diageo) was looking for a clear path to majority, said an investment banker who did not wish to be named.        
	A United Spirits spokesperson confirmed that the deal was off but refused to elaborate on the reasons why Diageo had backed out of the potential alliance.         
	Earlier in the year, United Spirits chairman Vijay Mallya had confirmed that Diageo was keen to own a stake equivalent to Mallyas in USL.        
	Mallya had initially offered a 14.9 per cent stake (comprising treasury stock) but was open to the idea of Diageo acquiring a larger shareholding in the UB group flagship.        
	Incidentally, Mallya does not have a direct stake in USL. He, however, holds a 36.57 per cent in USL through United Breweries Holdings and other investment companies. Financial institutions and the public hold the remaining of the USL shares.         
	Diageo was formed in 1997 with the merger of Guinness Plc and Grand Metropolitan Plc. It has a presence in India through a subsidiary called Diageo India that sells brands such as Smirnoff and Johnnie Walker.        
	It also has a presence in the Indian-made foreign liquor segment through a 50:50 joint venture with Radico Khaitan.        
	Back in May, a Diageo executive had said the talks with USL were not making headway as the two could not agree on details.        
	USL has been trying to deleverage its balance sheet as it is stuck with a massive debt. A stake sale to Diageo would have helped it do just that. Sources said USL had already initiated talks with global private equity players such as Kohlberg Kravis Roberts. It is likely to pursue that route more seriously now that talks with Diageo have collapsed.

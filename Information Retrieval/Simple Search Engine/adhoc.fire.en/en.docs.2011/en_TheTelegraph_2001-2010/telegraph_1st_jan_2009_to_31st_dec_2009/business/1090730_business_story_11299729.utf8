	Calcutta, July 29: BHP Billiton has pulled out of the mining joint venture with Calcutta-based Usha Martin.        
	The worlds largest miner from Australia had teamed up with Usha Martin, one of the leading makers of steel wire and wire ropes, globally, in early 2006.        
	BHP sold its holding to Usha Martin earlier this year, Rajeev Jhawar, managing director of Usha Martin, said today.        
	The decision followed the global economic meltdown in October. It was a resetting of priorities, he said.        
	Consequently, Usha Martin now owns 100 per cent of Bharat Minex Pvt Ltd  a joint venture formed with BHP Minerals Holdings Pty Ltd, a subsidiary of BHP Billiton.        
	Prashant Jhawar, vice-chairman of Usha Martin, said Bharat Minex did not have any asset, and his company paid Rs 5 lakh to buy the shares.        
	The company had been set up for mining and downstream activities in Jharkhand. Usha Martin has been operating for 50 years in the state, having a steel, wire and wire rope plant, coal and iron ore mines.        
	P. Bhattacharya, joint managing director of Usha Martin, said the two parties collected some data which remained with the company.        
	We did not apply for any mining block, he said.        
	BHPs exit underlines the extent to which the commodity cycle has turned on its head, from the heady days of 2005 to rock bottom in September 2008.        
	BHP had been eyeing Indian iron ore mining leases for a long time but could not get a toehold.        
	Net profit falls        
	The consolidated net profit of Usha Martin fell 51 per cent to Rs 32.03 crore during the first quarter of 2009-10 against Rs 65.08 crore in the same period last fiscal. Net sales fell 13 per cent to Rs 608.54 crore from Rs 698.69 crore in the same period last year.

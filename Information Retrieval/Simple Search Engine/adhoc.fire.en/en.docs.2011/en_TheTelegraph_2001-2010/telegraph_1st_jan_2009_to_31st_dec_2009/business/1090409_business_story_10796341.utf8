The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Cloud on Tatas $500m bond issue 
                                                                                                               Cloud on Tatas $500m bond issue 
          PIYA SINGH                          SHELVED AGAIN                                  
	Mumbai, April 8: Tata Sons plans to float an over $500-million overseas bond issue may have been put on the shelf yet again.        
	The apex holding company of the $62.5-billion Tata group sounded out sovereign wealth funds and overseas hedge fund managers earlier this year to determine whether they would be interested in an issue of securities that would get converted into shares of a basket of Tata group companies.        
	Tata Sons was keen to raise money to meet the funding needs of group companies which have made several acquisitions overseas, especially Tata Motors that bought Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) for $2.3 billion last year.        
	Investment bankers said the plan might now be put on the back burner for several reasons, including possible support from the UK government for JLR.        
	Tata Sons has been toying with the idea of an overseas bond issue for a while now. Last year, it abandoned the plan after the market crashed only to resume a dialogue with potential investors early this year in January and February.        
	When asked whether Tata Sons would shelve its overseas bond issue plans if it received assistance from the UK government for JLR, a Tata group spokesperson said, Tata Sons would not like to comment in this regard.        
	Tata Motors recently got some relief with the European Investment Bank (EIB) agreeing to support automobile companies, including JLR, to make cleaner cars. Reports in the international media on Tuesday said the EIB had assisted JLR with a loan of 366 million euros or roughly Rs 2,500 crore to support plans to reduce emissions.        
	A JLR spokesperson has been quoted in media reports abroad as saying, This loan will support Jaguar Land Rovers significant investments in environmental technologies that are crucial for the future.        
	However, the EIB loan is for a specific purpose and Tata Motors is still seeking assistance from the UK government to address its funding needs.         
	We are in discussions for working capital facilitation for Jaguar Land Rover under the UK governments Automotive Assistance Programme (AAP) to the extent of 500 million additional funding. The discussions are on, said a Tata Motors spokesperson.

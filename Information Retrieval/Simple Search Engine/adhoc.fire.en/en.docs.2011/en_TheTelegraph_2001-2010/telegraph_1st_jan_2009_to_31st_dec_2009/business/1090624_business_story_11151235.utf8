          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                            
	Mumbai, June 23: A bidding war has broken out for Great Offshore Ltd  the Rs 1,140-crore offshore oilfield services provider.        
	The takeover battle began today with ABG Shipyard, the countrys largest private shipbuilder, offering to pay Rs 375 per share for a 32.12 per cent stake in Great Offshore.        
	The ABG Shipyard bid topped Bharati Shipyards open offer in early June to purchase a 20 per cent stake at Rs 344 per share.         
	By late evening, Bharati Shipyard indicated that it would raise its offer price in the next few days.         
	We will be making another revised offer in the next few days. I cant tell you what the price will be, P.C. Kapoor, managing director of Bharati Shipyard, said. The buzz in the market is it will raise the price to Rs 403 per share.        
	On Tuesday, Bharati Shipyard raised its holding in Great Offshore to 19.47 per cent after quickly picking up a 4.58 per cent stake through a block deal at a price of Rs 403 per share.        
	ABG Shipyard holds around 2.02 per cent in Great Offshore, which it acquired from the open market.        
	The Great Offshore scrip spurted almost 8 per cent to close at Rs 413.60 on the Bombay Stock Exchange.        
	Bharati Shipyard ended 5 per cent lower at Rs 162, while ABG Shipyard climbed nearly 2 per cent to Rs 213.15.        
	Takeover play        
	Vijay Sheth, the former vice-chairman and managing director of Great Offshore, had asked Bharati Shipyard for a loan of Rs 240 crore to repay the amount owed to two financial institutions. In exchange, he had pledged a 14.89 per cent stake in Great Offshore.        
	Sheth was unable to repay the loan and Bharati decided in May to invoke the pledge and acquired the shares at Rs 315 per share. As a result, Sheths holding fell below 1 per cent, turning Great Offshore into a prime takeover target.        
	It is speculated that Vijay Sheths cousins, who control Great Eastern Shipping, had sold the shares to Bharati today.        
	ABG Shipyard chairman Rishi Agarwal said it was making a counter offer as it saw tremendous synergies from Great Offshore. The acquisition will turn ABG into an integrated marine services enterprise.  
	The company will have to shell out a little over Rs 471 crore to acquire the 32.12 per cent stake. Both ABG Shipyard and Bharati Shipyard have cash worth Rs 300 crore each on their books.

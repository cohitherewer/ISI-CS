                                                                                                                 Q amp;A      Taxing times
                                I get annual pension of Rs 1.80 lakh per annum under Swatantrata Senani Samman. I also get a state government pension of Rs 70,500 per year. My annual interest income is Rs 1.85 lakh. I am investing Rs 4,000 per month in MFs. Shall I have to file income tax return for 2008-09? Will the invested amount of Rs 48,000 deducted from the taxable income? Shall I have to make any additional tax-saving investments?          Harabhusan Pandey, Calcutta
                Your total annual income is Rs 3,35,500. The basic exempted income limit for senior citizens is Rs 2,25,000. So, your annual taxable income is Rs 1,10,000 and the tax liability will be Rs 22,660, including education cess. If the MFs you have invested in are not equity-linked savings schemes (ELSS), you wont be able to claim any tax deduction. If you had not invested in ELSS, you can consider depositing Rs 1 lakh in tax-saving FDs of banks or National Savings Certificate. Consider ELSS if you are able to take the risk of equity investment. However, you will have to submit tax returns as you have a taxable income.                                  Legal route      I am a senior citizen having total income within the basic exemption limit. Since my retirement I have been submitting income tax returns and paying short-term capital gains tax. Is my action in accordance with law? If not, please mention the provision for the payment of short-term capital gains tax.        Ajoy K. Ghosal, Calcutta
                    Capital gains is a separate block of income but that does not take away the right of an individual to basic exemption limit. Since your annual income is less than the basic exemption limit on income, you need not pay capital gains tax.                                  Share trouble      I purchased shares of companies such as Genelec, Modicarepet, Pharmax Corporation and some others. How can I get back at least some money from these companies?         Shyamalendu Guha, Jadavpur
                    You will have to check out how many of these companies are still traded on the stock exchanges. You may not get anything from the firms that have been delisted.                         If you have any queries about investing or taxes or a high-cost purchase you are planning, mail to: btgraphabpmail.com, or write to: Business Telegraph, 6 Prafulla Sarkar Street, Calcutta 700 001.

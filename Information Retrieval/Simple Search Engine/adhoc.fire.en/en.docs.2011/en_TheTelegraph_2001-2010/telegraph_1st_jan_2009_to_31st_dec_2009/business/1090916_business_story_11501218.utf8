          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Mumbai, Sept. 15: Tata Motors has raised Rs 236.5 crore by selling 50 lakh shares it held in Tata Steel to the groups holding company Tata Sons.        
	The Tata Steel shares were sold at Rs 473 apiece through a block deal. On Tuesday, the Tata Steel stock rose 2.5 per cent to close at Rs 491.25 on the Bombay Stock Exchange.        
	Tata Motors has been on a fund-raising spree over the past few months to meet its working capital requirements and trim its debt.        
	In effect, the shareholding of the Tata group has not been affected by this transaction.        
	According to data collated from the BSE, after the block deal on Tuesday, Tata Motors holds 54,40,882 shares, or less than 1 per cent in Tata Steel.        
	Tata Motors had pledged its entire holding of over 1.04 crore shares in Tata Steel last month.        
	The company suffered an after-tax loss of Rs 329 crore and consolidated gross revenue of Rs 16,954 crore in the first quarter of the current fiscal. For the year ended March 31, 2009, the company suffered a loss of Rs 2,505 crore on a total income of Rs 71,738 crore.         
	Tata Motors was badly hit last year as the economic slowdown dragged down vehicle sales. It was also under pressure to service the debt it raised to finance the $2.3billion acquisition of Jaguar and Land Rover and meet the working capital needs of the two marquee British motoring brands.         
	The Tata Motors scrip closed at Rs 569.25 on Tuesday, an increase of 1.33 per cent over the previous close.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Value stores take lead in retail revival
                                                                                                               Value stores take lead in retail revival
          VIVEK NAIR                               
	Mumbai, April 26: The cash tills should start ringing loud and clear at retailing establishments around the country, and the first indications of this have started to show up at the value stores.         
	Recent data suggest that same store sales (SSS)  a key metric that the retailing industry uses to measure performance  are starting to show a flicker of growth. After several months of declining sales, SSS in the value segment, which is represented by outfits such as Pantaloon Retail, are starting to claw back.         
	This retailing metric compares sales of stores that have been open for a year or more. This statistic helps analysts determine which portion of sales have come from sales growth at existing stores, leaving out the portion realised from new stores.           
	Observers who track the organised retail sector say that value retailers have been able to sustain footfalls in recent times.   
	This does not mean that the entire industry is out of the woods. Analysts aver that future growth in organised retail in India will be led by value retailing and that any economic turnaround will benefit other segments such as lifestyle retail only at a later stage.         
	Organised retail has been under pressure since the second half of 2008. With consumers cutting back spends, players such as Pantaloon Retail were affected as same store sales declined. For instance, in December 2008, SSS were at a negative 3.6 per cent in the value segment. It tumbled 14 per cent in the lifestyle segment and 10 per cent in the home retail segment.         
	It is only a slight blip at the moment, but experts are drawing comfort from the fact that the retailers, particularly, those in the value segment, who were badly roiled by the slowdown, are no longer showing a sharp drop in sales.         
	In January, Pantaloon saw its SSS growth improve to 4 per cent and 12 per cent in the value retail and lifestyle segments, respectively. The numbers were 5 per cent and 4 per cent, respectively, in February. In March, Pantaloon Retail saw both the value and lifestyle segments registering a year-on-year growth of 5.3 per cent and 4.3 per cent, respectively.         
	The surge in SSS has acted as a ballast to the Pantaloon stock, which has crossed Rs 200 now against Rs 160-70 in the last week of January. In fact, brokerages have a buy rating on the stock as the company, apart from others such as Reliance Retail, is expected to benefit.         
	Promotions and discount programmes offered by Pantaloon accounted for the positive SSS.        
	However, analysts are not bullish on the prospects of others such as Shoppers Stop, which is more focused on lifestyle retailing. Shoppers Stop is likely to remain under pressure for at least the next three to four quarters, Unmesh Sharma and Gautam Duggad of Macquarie Research said.         
	They are also positive on Titan Industries and expect that emerging trends in gold demand could help the company in delivering good earnings growth.         
	In March, all the three retailing segments sustained year-on-year SSS growth at February levels. This indicates that consumer footfalls are being sustained and is expected to go up in the future following indications of a revival in the economy, although at a sluggish pace, said Raghav Sehgal, analyst at Angel Broking.

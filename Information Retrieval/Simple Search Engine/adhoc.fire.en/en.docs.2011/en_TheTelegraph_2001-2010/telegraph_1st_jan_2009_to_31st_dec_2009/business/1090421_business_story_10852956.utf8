The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Mahindra cash to clinch deal
                                                                                                               Mahindra cash to clinch deal
          OUR BUREAU                          NEW MEN on Satyam Board: (From right) Tech Mahindra vice-chairman Vineet Nayyar, president (international operations) C.P.

	April 20: Tech Mahindra today deposited Rs 2,910 crore into two escrow accounts to seal the deal for scam-scarred Satyam Computer Services.         
	The Pune-based infotech company named four directors to the Satyam board, including Tech Mahindras managing director Vineet Nayyar. The other three are C.P. Gurnani, Sanjay Kalra and Ulhas Yargop.        
	A team led by Anand Mahindra conferred with the government-appointed directors of Satyam in Hyderabad and chalked out the plans for the transition.         
	The government directors will remain on the board until disbanded by the Company Law Board.        
	Nayyar said Satyam would continue to function as a stand-alone unit with A.S. Murthy set to retain his position as chief executive officer under the new dispensation. A new chief financial officer will be named in the next few weeks.        
	The government directors have also given the Mahindra team a list of 100 key officials who should be retained.        
	Satyam will make a preferential offer of shares to a Tech Mahindra subsidiary  Venturbay Consultants Private Ltd  amounting to a 31 per cent stake.         
	Tech Mahindra is expected to announce an open offer tomorrow to acquire another 20 per cent from the existing shareholders at the bid price of Rs 58 per share.         
	A formal document outlining the terms of the open offer will be submitted to the market regulator after obtaining regulatory approvals from the US and German authorities. These approvals are necessary to avoid anti-trust suits in those jurisdictions.        
	Satyam may not be a racing car but it is no longer a sinking ship, Anand Mahindra told reporters after day-long discussions with the board and Satyam officials. He refused to be drawn into a discussion on the liabilities of the fraud-hit company.        
	Mahindra said the immediate priority was to retain customers and win back some of the lost clients. Satyams headquarters will remain at Hyderabad, Nayyar said. There has been talk of a new logo for Satyam but no decision has been taken as yet.        
	The M amp;M team also refused to say whether there would be any job cuts. Our priority is to make sure that we have a financially viable entity, Nayyar said even as he expressed confidence in resurrecting Satyam.        
	I believe Satyam is on its way to a very viable future, Mahindra said.        
	The Mahindra group raised the money for the Satyam deal in 72 hours flat  and from non-banking sources.        
	It just goes to show the kind of financial strength that we have in India. It would have been next to impossible to raise this sum abroad in the light of the global meltdown, Mahindra said.         
	M amp;M groups CFO Bharat Doshi said Rs 700 crore had come from the cash-rich automobile giant M amp;M. Tech Mahindra has raised another Rs 875 crore through the flotation of a non-convertible debenture issue and commercial paper that had been heavily subscribed by mutual funds and non-banking finance companies. The rest had come through an assignment of receivables  which is jargon for loans against future earnings.

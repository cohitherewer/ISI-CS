The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Rupee at new low
                                                                                                               Rupee at new low
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                            
	Mumbai, March 2: The rupee today ended at an all-time low of 51.94 against the dollar, cheaper by 1.58 per cent from its last close of 51.14.        
	Dealers said a sharp slide in local stocks was the main cause for concern as foreign funds were likely to pull out from the weak equity market.        
	I dont see the rupee reversing its trend. It may soon hit 52.50 to a dollar and the 53 level may also be very much in sight, said Urvi Gandhi, analyst at Mecklai Financial Services.         
	India has been badly hit by the global recession as seen from the export and import statistics released today, she said. The possibility of a rating downgrade by Standard amp; Poors and its subsequent impact on FII outflows is putting pressure on the rupee.        
	The sensex today tumbled 285 points, or 3.20 per cent, while Asian indices ended lower by 3 to 4 per cent.

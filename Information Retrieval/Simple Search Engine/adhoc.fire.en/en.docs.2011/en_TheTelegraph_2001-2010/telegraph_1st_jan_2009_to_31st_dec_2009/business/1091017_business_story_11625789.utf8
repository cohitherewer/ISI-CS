                                                                                                               Sterlite raises $500m
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                            
	Mumbai, Oct. 16: Sterlite Industries (India) Ltd today raised $500 million through convertible notes to fund the expansion of its copper smelter facilities at Tuticorin, Tamil Nadu. The news, however, was not well received by investors. On the BSE, the stock crashed 5.7 per cent to close at Rs 819.        
	As part of the expansion project, Sterlite will raise the smelting capacity to 8 lakh tonnes from 4 lakh tonnes and build a 160MW captive power plant. The expansion will make the Anil Agarwal group firms Tuticorin facility one of the largest smelters in the world.        
	The capital investment of Rs 2,300 crore will include the cost of the smelter, a refinery, the captive power unit and other facilities such as sulphuric acid and phosphoric acid plants.        
	The notes issued today will be convertible into Sterlites American Depository Shares (ADS). Each note will be converted into ADS at $23.33, subjected to adjustments. The notes have a maturity date of October 30, 2014, and will bear an interest rate of 4 per cent.        
	In a notice to the stock exchanges, Sterlite said the funds would also be used for overseas business acquisitions. Sterlites move has surprised analysts as the firm has around $3.5-billion cash on its books, and an equity dilution of 2.5 per cent is not necessary.         
	Sterlite is locked in a battle with Grupo Mexico to acquire Asarco LLC. A US district court is expected to give its decision next week. Last month, Sterlite faced a legal setback in its attempts to wrest control of Asarco when a US bankruptcy judge recommended for the second time that Grupo Mexicos plan be approved.

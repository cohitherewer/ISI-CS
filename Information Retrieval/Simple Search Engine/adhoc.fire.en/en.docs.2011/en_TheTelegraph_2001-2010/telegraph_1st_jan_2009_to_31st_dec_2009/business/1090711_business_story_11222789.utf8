                                                                                                               Tata stake in Lankan trailer firm
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Calcutta, July 10: TRF Ltd, an associate firm of Tata Steel, has bought a 51 per cent stake in a Sri Lankan trailer manufacturer for Rs 42 crore.        
	Dutch Lanka Trailer Manufacturers Ltd (DLT) has operations in Sri Lanka and India. DLT, which has a joint venture with Tata International in India, produces 3,000 trailers each in Sri Lanka and Pune.        
	The stake buy is aimed at diversifying the product portfolio of the Indian company, which makes equipment for bulk handling by steel, power and mining firms, Sudhir Deoras, managing director of TRF, said.        
	DLT sells trailers in 30 countries. It has a subsidiary in Oman for selling in the West Asian markets.        
	We see a huge opportunity for the trailer business in India, despite the downturn. The market could be of 100,000 trailers a year by 2014-15, he said here today.         
	Deoras, who flew in from Colombo this morning after signing the deal, has also signed an agreement to buy the rest of the DLT equity for Rs 40 crore in the future.        
	The trailer business is expected to pump up TRFs turnover to Rs 2,500 crore by 2013 from Rs 723 crore last fiscal. However, the existing portfolio is also expected to do well. The company is now bidding for providing equipment to big power plants.        
	Around 70 per cent of our turnover will continue to be from bulk material handling when we reach Rs 2,500 crore, R.C. Nandrajog, executive director of TRF, said.

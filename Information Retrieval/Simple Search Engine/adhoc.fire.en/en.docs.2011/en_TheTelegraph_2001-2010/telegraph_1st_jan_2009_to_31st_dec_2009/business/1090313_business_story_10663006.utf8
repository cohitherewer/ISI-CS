The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Ceiling on sugar stock holding 
                                                                                                               Ceiling on sugar stock holding 
                            
	New Delhi, March 12 (PTI): The Centre has announced the imposition of stock and turnover limits on sugar, prescribing the maximum quantity a trader can keep, while giving flexibility to states to increase the limits further.        
	The order will be implemented within 15 days after it is published in the official gazette.         
	The turnover limit will be 30 days from the date of receipt of stocks by a recognised dealer, while the stock holding limit is 1,000 tonnes for the traders in Calcutta and 200 tonnes for others, the food ministry said.        
	As sugar is mostly packed in 100-kg jute bags, a recognised dealer in Calcutta and its adjoining areas, which is the largest market in the country, can keep a maximum of 10,000 bags at any point of time. In other parts one can stock up to 2,000 bags.        
	Since Calcutta also caters to the demand of the northeastern states, the Centre has decided a higher limit for it.        
	On March 6, the empowered group of ministers on food, headed by external affairs minister Pranab Mukherjee, decided to impose stock limits on sugar to control domestic prices.         
	The Centre has given the states the power to increase the stock limits if they desire, but they cannot reduce it.        
	Sugar importers under open general licence have been kept out of the ambit of the stock limit order.        
	PAN duty        
	The government has imposed 20 per cent safeguard duty on pthallic anhydride (PAN) for over six months to discourage imports and protect local producers, a senior commerce ministry official said.         
	The chemical is used in manufacturing plastics and dyes.

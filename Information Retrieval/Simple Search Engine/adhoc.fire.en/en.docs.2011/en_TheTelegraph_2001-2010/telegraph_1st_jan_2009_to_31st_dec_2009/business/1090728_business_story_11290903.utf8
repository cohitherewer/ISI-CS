	Mumbai, July 27: Tata Motors surprised the Street by posting a nearly 58 per cent jump in profit after tax at Rs 513.76 crore for the quarter ended June 30.        
	The sharp increase in profit comes at a time when the automobile industry has started to find its feet after a prolonged slump.         
	The surge in profit after tax has been helped by a change in accounting policy, reduction in raw material prices and a focus on cutting costs.        
	The company also improved its operating margin to 11.4 per cent from 7.12 per cent in the previous year.         
	Tata Motors posted revenues of Rs 6,404.63 crore for the quarter ended June 30, 2009, a decline of 7.6 per cent compared with Rs 6,928.44 crore in the corresponding quarter of the previous year.        
	Other income for the quarter also included a profit of Rs 318.89 crore from the sale of long-term investments, including a stake in Tata Steel.        
	Tata Motors, which bought Jaguar Land Rover last year for $2.3 billion, is trying to de-leverage its balance sheet. The interest cost for the quarter at Rs 253.45 crore increased 126 per cent as the company had taken on additional debt during the year to meet its capital expenditure and working capital needs.        
	We will continue to try and de-leverage our balance sheet through some divestments. We will also raise capital at an appropriate time, Tata Motors chief financial officer C.Ramakrishnan said during a media interaction.         
	He, however, refused to say whether Tata Motors would opt for a GDR flotation as some Tata group companies had done. Tata Motors has also recently rolled over $1 billion of debt and pre-paid $150 million out of this number.         
	The companys domestic sales volume fell 1.4 per cent to 1,22,120 vehicles compared with the corresponding quarter of the previous year.         
	Exports plunged 43 per cent as key markets such as South Africa, Russia, Turkey and West Asia were roiled by the global recession.

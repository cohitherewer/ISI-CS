                                                                                                               IT eyes longer tax holiday
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Calcutta, Feb. 26: The Union IT ministry is lobbying for an extension of the Software Technology Parks of India (STPI) scheme till 2015.        
	We have already placed our recommendations with the finance ministry, IT secretary Jainder Singh said here today on the sidelines of the inauguration of IndiaSoft 2009.        
	The STPI scheme, which provides tax exemption to both IT and ITeS firms, is due to expire on March 31, 2010. Units in software parks that fall under the scheme are eligible for a 10-year income tax holiday.         
	Singh said IT and ITeS exports were expected to touch $47 billion this year, a growth rate of nearly 18 per cent. Total employment in this sector should also touch 2.23 million people by this fiscal. We expect manpower growth to continue at 15 per cent for 2009-10 as well, he said.        
	IndiaSoft 2009 is a two-day exhibition and conference organised by the Electronics and Software Export Promotion Council.         
	We expect the extension of the scheme will be announced in the full-year budget, Singh said. Earlier this month, Nasscom said it hoped the government would take several steps, including a greater thrust on e-governance and higher education to boost domestic consumption.         
	State priority        
	Bengal chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee  who inaugurated IndiaSoft today  said the states hardware industry needed a push.         
	We are doing well in the software and services sector. Its time for Bengal to boost the hardware industry, he said.

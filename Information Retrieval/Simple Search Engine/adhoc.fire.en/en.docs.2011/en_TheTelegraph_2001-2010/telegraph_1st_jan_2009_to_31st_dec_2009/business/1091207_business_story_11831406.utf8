                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      VW uses Beetle to push Polo
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          SMART DRIVE                                  
	Mumbai, Dec. 6: The New Beetle should help strengthen the Volkswagen brand in India, which will come in handy when the German firm launches the hatchback Polo next year.        
	The launch of the New Beetle is part of our exercise to further build the Volkswagen brand in India. We want to build a strong foundation here. We will use it to focus on volume growth next year onwards, said Neeraj Garg, member of the board and director of Volkswagen Passenger Cars.        
	Volkswagen hopes to end this calendar year with sales of 3,000 units but expects them to increase to over 25,000 units following the launch of the Polo. After having launched the Passat and Jetta, the German car maker is focussing on the Polo.        
	From December 12, a plant at Chakan, Maharashtra, will start making the car.        
	As part of its brand-building strategy, Volkswagen had launched the Touareg  a sports utility vehicle  at a price of Rs 51.85 lakh, ex-showroom Delhi, along with the New Beetle on Friday         
	The New Beetle  to cost about Rs 20 lakh  will be imported from Mexico as a completely built unit.         
	Garg said Volkswagen had received 200 enquiries for the car, of which 150 were confirmed bookings.         
	Volkswagen is initially targeting the niche customer for the New Beetle, but Garg said it would create a different segment.        
	The company, however, has no immediate plans of manufacturing the car in India.         
	The New Beetle is equipped with a 2 litre, four-cylinder petrol engine and paired with six-speed automatic transmission. It features four airbags, an anti-lock braking system and a power steering.        
	The Beetle is the very first Volkswagen car people remember about, with its unique shape and reliability. We are excited to bring this iconic Beetle to India after its success across the world for decades, Garg had said at the Friday launch.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | RIL gas to deflate oil import bill
                                                                                                               RIL gas to deflate oil import bill
          OUR BUREAU                              
	April 2: Reliance Industries Ltd today started pumping gas from Indias largest offshore gas field in the Krishna-Godavari basin, which is expected to knock 10 per cent, or $9 billion, off the countrys annual oil import bill.        
	The company said it took just six-and-a-half years from discovery to start gas production from the deep-sea KG-D6 block against the global average of nine to 10 years.        
	The deep-water block in the Bay of Bengal is expected to yield 40 million cubic metres of gas per day by July. It will reach a peak production capacity of 80 million cubic metres a day next year. At peak production, KG-D6 is expected to supply 550,000 barrels of oil equivalent a day.        
	Natural gas production from wells started last evening and it reached the onland receiving facility at Gadimoga near Kakinada in Andhra Pradesh this morning. It took 13 to 14 hours for the gas to travel from the sea bed to the onshore facility, the company said.        
	The gas will first be supplied to Nagarjuna Fertilizers and Chemicals Ltd  the first of the 11 fertiliser plants that will receive gas supplies in the initial phase. Company sources said Nagarjuna would receive the gas by Saturday.        
	The other fertiliser plants, which have also signed agreements with RIL, will receive the gas by April 15 through the East-West pipeline built by Reliance Gas Transportation Infrastructure Ltd. This pipeline will inter-connect with the pipelines of GAIL (India) Ltd and Gujarat State Petronet Ltd.        
	The gas is flowing out of two wells called Dhirubhai 1 and 3  the first two of the 18 gas finds in KG-D6 that have been put into production. Reliance has created history and has once again demonstrated its ability to implement complex projects on a par with the best performance benchmarks in the world, Mukesh Ambani, chairman and managing director of RIL, said.        
	RIL has 90 per cent participating interest in the field. Niko Resources of Canada holds the rest. Under the bidding terms for the oil blocks, the government is entitled to a share of the profits.        
	Gas sales will generate $42 billion in revenues over the 11-year life of the field. The governments share is likely to be a minimum of $14 billion, petroleum secretary R. S. Pandey said.        
	The project worth Rs 44,175 crore will double domestic natural gas production when it reaches peak output in 2010 and wipe out the fuel deficit at urea-making fertiliser plants. It will also meet half of the gas shortfall at power plants, which is estimated at 36 million cubic metres per day.        
	RIL expects that the supply of gas to fertiliser and power projects will substantially reduce the subsidy burden of the government. Sources said the government could save between Rs 2,000-3,000 crore on subsidies.        
	Director-general of hydrocarbons V. K. Sibal said RIL had proposed to invest about Rs 29,800 crore in developing nine more discoveries in its eastern offshore KG-D6 block. The development covering nine satellite discoveries was submitted to the management committee (by RIL) in July 2008. We are yet to take a view, he said.        
	The RIL scrip today rose 5.3 per cent to close at 1,662.50 on the Bombay Stock Exchange.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Calcutta, Dec. 9: Tata Steel is set to acquire sick cable manufacturer Incab after the Board for Industrial and Financial Reconstruction (BIFR) approved its revival plan over two other bidders.         
	The Tatas will have to provide a detailed revival scheme to the board within 75 days.        
	We have offered a Rs 98.7-crore package for Incab, a Tata Steel spokesperson said.        
	Incab has plants in Jamshedpur and Pune and assets in a few other cities, including Calcutta.        
	Before shutting down 10 years ago, the company made cables for mining, power and defence companies.        
	With Incab, Tata Steel could be entering the cable business.        
	RR Cables and Pegasus were also in the fray to take over the cable manufacturer.         
	The BIFR has chosen Tata Steel as it considered the Tatas to be in a better position to take care of Incabs 1,600 workers.        
	Earlier, Tata Steel had decided to move court in the interest of the workers and at the request of the Incab unions.        
	During the proceedings at Delhi High Court, Incab workers had filed an application pleading that Tata Steel should be directed to submit a revival scheme for the sick firm.         
	Subsequently, Tata Steel was asked by Delhi High Court to submit its proposal.        
	After several rounds of hearing, the ruling of the BIFR went in favour of Tata Steel.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Capital prop for PSU bank trio
                                                                                                               Capital prop for PSU bank trio

	New Delhi, Feb. 3: The central government plans to spend Rs 1,700 crore to recapitalise Central Bank, Vijaya Bank and Calcuttas United Bank, which will improve the capital adequacy ratio (CAR) of the trio.        
	It will provide the money in the vote-on-account on February 16.        
	While a number of public sector banks, including Calcuttas Uco, were shortlisted, finally three were picked, officials said.         
	It has been decided that only those banks with CAR between 10 per cent and 12 per cent will be considered.         
	Capital adequacy ratio indicates a banks risk-taking ability. The RBI uses CAR to track whether a bank is meeting its statutory capital requirements and is capable of absorbing a reasonable amount of loss. If CAR rises beyond a limit, banks need to either infuse more capital or sell risky assets.        
	For most Indian banks, CAR is well above the international standard of 8 per cent and the RBIs norm of 9 per cent.         
	According to the officials, the criteria for selection was the ability of banks to absorb funds and those who had not been able to make dramatic changes in the CAR in the last three quarters. Others will be taken up, if needed, later.         
	As a policy, the government is averse to investing in a public sector bank. But recapitalisation is exempted, they said.         
	Central Bank had reported a net profit of Rs 353.26 crore for the three months ended December 31, 2008, an increase of 75.74 per cent from Rs 201.01- crore profit in the corresponding period of the previous year. Total income rose to Rs 3,033.41 crore from Rs 2,205.48 crore a year ago.         
	For the nine months till December, the Mumbai-based bank had a net profit of Rs 508.73 crore, a 20.27 per cent increase from Rs 422.96-crore profit a year ago.         
	Central Banks total income in the nine months rose to Rs 8,374.83 crore from Rs 6,187.69 crore a year ago.        
	Vijaya Bank reported a 23.73 per cent growth in net profit at Rs 156.99 crore for the third quarter ended December 31, 2008. Its profit was Rs 126.88 crore a year ago.        
	Total income rose 43.52 per cent to Rs 1,634.98 crore in the quarter from Rs 1,139.19 crore a year ago. For the nine months ended December, the Bangalore-based bank earned a net profit of Rs 160.23 crore, down 53.35 per cent over the year-ago period.        
	The recapitalisation move comes in the wake of PSU banks agreeing to the proposals of the government on interest rate cuts and more loans, which are expected to spur demand. Already Calcuttas Uco Bank and Corporation Bank have cut rates. Punjab National Bank, the No. 2 lender among PSU banks, had cut rates last week.

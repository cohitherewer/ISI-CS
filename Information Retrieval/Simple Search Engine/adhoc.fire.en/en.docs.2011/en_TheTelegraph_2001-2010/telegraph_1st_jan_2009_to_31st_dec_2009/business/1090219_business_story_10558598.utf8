          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              Mukesh and Anil Ambani: Troubled times				                                 
	New Delhi, Feb. 18: The Ambani brothers are in trouble.        
	The Centre today informed the Lok Sabha that companies owned by Mukesh and Anil Ambani Reliance Petroleum and Reliance Infrastructure, respectively were under the scanner.        
	Reliance Petroleum is facing an investigation for insider trading, while Reliance Infrastructure has been charged with violating foreign exchange regulations.        
	Mukesh Ambani-led Reliance Petroleum (RPL) was one of the 19 companies against which market regulator Sebi had received complaints of insider trading, stand-in finance minister Pranab Mukherjee said in a written reply.         
	In the last three years, including the current year (up to January 31, 2009), Sebi is in receipt of complaints alleging insider trading in the shares of 19 listed companies. One of (them) is against Reliance Petroleum, an oil-based company, he added.        
	Responding to another question, minister of state for finance Pawan Kumar Bansal said the Reserve Bank had referred to the enforcement directorate cases against Anil Ambani-led Reliance Infrastructure Ltd for the misuse of external commercial borrowings (ECBs).        
	The RBI referred the violations under the Foreign Exchange Management Act (Fema) relating to two ECBs ($360 million and $150 million raised in July and November 2006, respectively) to the enforcement directorate on November 7, 2008 for necessary action, Bansal said.        
	The Anil Ambani group was facing a probe for parking a part of the proceeds raised through the ECB issues in fixed deposits and debt mutual funds, which was not permitted by the guidelines at that time, he added.        
	Mukherjee today said the market regulator had received complaints of insider trading against nine companies in 2006, six in 2007, three in 2008 and one in 2009. However, he did not name any company except RPL.        
	Sebi has asked the Bombay Stock Exchange and the National Stock Exchange to examine trading in the RPL scrip in both the cash and derivatives markets on November 1 and November 29, 2007, when the stock price touched a life-time high of Rs 295 on the BSE.

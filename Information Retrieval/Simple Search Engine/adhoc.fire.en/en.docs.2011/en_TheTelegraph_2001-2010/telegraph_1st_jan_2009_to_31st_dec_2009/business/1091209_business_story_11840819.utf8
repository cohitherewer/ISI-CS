	New Delhi, Dec. 8: Indian industry wants the governments stimulus package to continue till the next fiscal.        
	During a meeting with revenue secretary P.V. Bhide today, industry body Ficci demanded more sops in the next budget.        
	Ficci also feels the Reserve Bank of India should not restrain liquidity as it will hurt the process of economic recovery, which is still at a nascent stage.        
	While we are conscious of the problem of a high fiscal deficit, we feel that the government can revert to the FRBM (fiscal responsibility and budget management) target only after the economy has recovered well from the ongoing crisis, said Ficci president Harshpati Singhania.        
	The apex industry body said it was important for the stimulus to stay beyond March.        
	The government had slashed taxes and announced fiscal incentives for industries hit by recession, which had hurt exports and manufacturing. Tax giveaway was to the tune of about Rs 40,000 crore.         
	However with GDP growth expected to be near 7 per cent for the year and industrial growth above 9 per cent, the government now wants to roll back the stimulus measures in phases.        
	We have urged the revenue secretary to ensure continuation of the stimulus for at least the next six monthswe believe it is needed to sustain growth, Singhania said.

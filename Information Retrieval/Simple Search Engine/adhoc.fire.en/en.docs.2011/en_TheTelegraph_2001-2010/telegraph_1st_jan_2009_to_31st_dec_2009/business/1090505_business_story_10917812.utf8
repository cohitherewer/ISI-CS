The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | ONGC hunts for Iraq ally
                                                                                                               ONGC hunts for Iraq ally

	New Delhi, May 4: State-owned Oil and Natural Gas Corporation Ltd is looking for partners to bid for three oil fields in Iraq. ONGC Ltd is among the 32 firms to qualify for the bidding.        
	Sources said ONGC Videsh Ltd, the overseas arm of ONGC, had held preliminary talks with Malaysias Petronas, Russias Gazprom, Frances Total and the UKs BP. It has already paid a participation fee for the bidding.        
	However, ONGC can finalise its strategy only after a new government is formed at the Centre, sources said. Of the six oil fields on offer in Iraq, OVL is eyeing Zubair, West Qurna and Rumaila.        
	Some of the global players to qualify include BHP Billiton, BP, Chevron, Petronas, China National Offshore Oil Company Limited, China National Petroleum Corporation, Gazprom, Total, ConocoPhillips, Royal Dutch Shell, Mitsubishi and Nippon Oil.        
	The Iraqi government, which has invited bids for blocks for the first time after the fall of the Saddam Hussein government, has asked the consortia to submit their bids by June. It plans to sign the contracts in August.        
	Firms will have to pay a signature bonus within a month of winning a contract. This fee has been increased manifold since the qualifying round held in November last year. The increase in signature bonus could make the bidding firms cautious and that is why they would go in for a consortia approach to minimise the risk, analysts said.                          
	These bonuses add to the burden of requirements for huge early investments in the fields, analysts said.        
	The signature bonus for the three oil fields works out to around $1,200 million. Individually, it stands at $300 million for Zubair, $400 million for West Qurna and $500 million for Rumaila.        
	According to the bidding, each consortium should have a qualified operator holding a minimum of 30 per cent in the consortium for a field and each of the partners should have at least 5 per cent.        
	A company cannot be part of different consortia for the same field, but can join different consortia for different fields.         
	A consortium cannot bid for more than three fields and no company cannot operate in more than one field.        
	The Rumaila field is located in the south of Iraq and has a reserve of 16.2 billion barrels. The Zubair oil field in southern Iraq has 3.87 billion barrels, while West Qurna in southern Iraq has 16.65 billion barrels.                    
	Since US-led invasion of Iraq, international firms have been lining up for access to some of the worlds biggest remaining known deposits of high-quality crude oil. Iraq ranks third, behind Saudi Arabia and Iran, in proved oil reserves, and is believed to hold significant potential for further large discoveries that some experts suggest could more than double its current reserves of 115 billion barrels.               
	The state-run firm had earlier entered into joint venture agreements with these firms for exploration and production activities in India and abroad.        
	Sources said, OVL is looking at Zubair, West Qurna and Rumaila oil fields and is keen to bid in consortium with global firms.

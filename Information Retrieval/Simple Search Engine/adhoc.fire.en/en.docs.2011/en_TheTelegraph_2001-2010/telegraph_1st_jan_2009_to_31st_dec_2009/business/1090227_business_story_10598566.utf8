                                                                                                               Rupee ends at new low 
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Mumbai, Feb. 26: The rupee today slumped to a new low of 50.47 against the dollar, a fall of 52 paise over its previous close. This is on acount of the month-end demand for the dollar from importers and pessimism on the economic front.         
	Analysts fear the currency may soon hit the all-time intra-day low of 50.65 struck in December last year. Some expect the currency to breach the 51-mark in the coming days.         
	At the inter-bank forex market, the rupee opened lower at 50.03 per dollar from the overnight close of 49.95.         
	The fall has been attributed to aggressive dollar buying by importers, particularly oil companies which purchase dollars at the end of month to pay for their imports.         
	Dealers said apart from oil companies, arbitrage  where banks purchase dollars here to sell them in the offshore market  also had a role to play. The rupee hit a low of 50.48 during intra-day trade.         
	Urvi Gandhi, analyst at Mecklai Financial Services, said the Indian currencys fall had also to do with the bleak economic outlook.         
	The export data will be out soon and a disappointing picture is expected. This apart, there are concerns on a possible downgrade by international credit rating agencies, she said.

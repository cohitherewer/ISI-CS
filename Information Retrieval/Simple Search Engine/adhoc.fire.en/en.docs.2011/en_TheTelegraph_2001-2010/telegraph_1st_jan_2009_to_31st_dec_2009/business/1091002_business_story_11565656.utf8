The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Ambani tiff hits oil hunt
                                                                                                               Ambani tiff hits oil hunt
          R. SURYAMURTHY                          Sibal: Apprehensive                                  
	New Delhi, Oct. 1: The Ambani gas dispute is starting to cast its shadow across the bidding process for new oil and gas exploration blocks in the country.        
	V.K. Sibal, director-general of hydrocarbons (DGH), today articulated the fear that negative publicity around the case would scare away prospective bidders ahead of the biggest auction of oil and gas blocks in the country.        
	The dispute grabbed headlines after Bombay High Court on June 15 upheld Anil Ambanis right to receive gas supplies at a 44 per cent discount to a government-mandated price of $4.20 per million British thermal unit (mBtu).         
	The government has since intervened aggressively in the case before the Supreme Court to assert its ownership of gas, its right to fix the price and cherry-pick customers who will receive it. The apex court is scheduled to start hearing the arguments on October 20.        
	I will be happy if we get an average of two bids per block, Sibal said.        
	Senior petroleum ministry officials, however, contested Sibals opinion. They argued that the response of the global players to the roadshows had been enthusiastic.        
	Asked if the dispute between the Ambani brothers would impact investor response, the upstream regulator said, Any corporate battle has a negative impact. No fight has a positive impact.        
	He said there would be fewer bids because of the negative publicity created by the fight between two corporate giants.         
	The government is auctioning 24 deep-sea blocks, 28 shallow water blocks and 18 onland blocks under the eighth round of bidding under the New Exploration Licensing Policy. The bids close on October 12.        
	Oil ministry officials, however, said the oil and gas explorers would take investment decisions based on long-term strategic goals and not on the basis of corporate spats.        
	In a bid to woo them, petroleum secretary R.S. Pandey said the government had restored a seven-year income-tax holiday for gas projects.

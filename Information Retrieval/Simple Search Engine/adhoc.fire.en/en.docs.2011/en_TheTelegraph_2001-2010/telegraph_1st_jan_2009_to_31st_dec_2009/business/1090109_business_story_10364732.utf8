          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Mumbai, Jan. 8: The woes of Satyam Computer Services and its investors are starting to mount.        
	Just a day after the National Stock Exchange removed the company from its benchmark index-Nifty, the Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) knocked the stock off the sensex. The bourse also took it off several other indices: the BSE-100, BSE-200, BSE-500, BSE-Teck and BSE-IT.        
	The exchange said Satyam would be replaced by Sun Pharmaceutical Industries in the benchmark index.         
	On the BSE-100 index, it will be replaced by GlaxoSmithkline Pharmaceuticals.         
	On the BSE-200 index, Castrol India will be substituting the IT services company.         
	Cadila Healthcare will be new entrant into the BSE-500 index.        
	The stock exchange said these replacements would be effective from January 12.

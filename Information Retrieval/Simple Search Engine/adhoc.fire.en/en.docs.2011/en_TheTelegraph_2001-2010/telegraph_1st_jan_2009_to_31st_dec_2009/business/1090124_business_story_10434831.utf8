The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | PM adviser pitches for lower rates
                                                                                                               PM adviser pitches for lower rates
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Tendulkar in New Delhi on Friday. (PTI)                                  
	New Delhi, Jan. 23: The Reserve Bank of India needs to cut key interest rates in its forthcoming monetary policy to stimulate growth, Suresh Tendulkar, chairman of the Prime Ministers Economic Advisory Council, said today.        
	There is scope for reducing both the repo and the reverse repo rates. Unless they (RBI) reduce the reverse repo, it will be difficult. I think they will have to reduce both, Tendulkar told reporters while releasing a review of the economy for 2008-09. He also expressed concern at the reluctance of banks to lend.         
	The Prime Ministers panel lowered the growth forecast for the current fiscal to 7.1 per cent from its earlier prediction of 7.7 per cent because of the global recession.        
	Tendulkar, however, said GDP was likely to expand 7-7.5 per cent in fiscal 2009-10.        
	According to the review, the slowdown was caused by painful adjustments to abrupt changes in international economy (following) the financial meltdown and deeper-than-anticipated recession in the advanced industrial countries in the second half.        
	The combined fiscal deficit of the Centre and the states on account of the fiscal stimulus and tax concessions given to industry to combat slowdown will be in excess of 10 per cent of GDP during the current financial year.        
	There is a compelling need to adjust the fiscal stance to the exceptional circumstances through which the economy has been passing. There is an equally urgent need to bring government finances back on the track of fiscal consolidation once there is an improvement in economic conditions, Tendulkar said.        
	The council, which advises the Prime Minister on key economic policy matters, said it expected inflation to fall further to 4.1 per cent by the end of February. Inflation now stands at 5.6 per cent.        
	According to the report, the rate of investment is estimated to be 35 per cent, lower by 2.5 per cent than the previous year because of financing constraints faced by Indian companies and a downturn in investor confidence in the second half of this fiscal.        
	On a sectoral basis, agriculture is expected to grow 3 per cent against the earlier projection of 2 per cent in July. The industrial sector is expected to grow 5.1 per cent, a significant dip from 7.5 per cent projected earlier.         
	The growth projection for service has marginally declined to 9.3 per cent from 9.6 per cent.         
	Tendulkar said the economy was likely to remain relatively weak in the first quarter of the next fiscal and slowly pick up and show strong recovery in the second half of the fiscal. He said the forecast had factored in the impact of monetary easing, fiscal stimulus and other administrative measures.

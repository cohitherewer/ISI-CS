The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Gold gets a price polish
                                                                                                               Gold gets a price polish
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                            
	Calcutta, Sept. 3: The price of pure gold (24-carat) today surged Rs 460 per 10 gm in the local bullion market to a seven-month high of Rs 15,935. Silver price was up Rs 500 per kg to Rs 25,200 from Wednesdays close of Rs 24,500.        
	From the beginning of this week, the prices of gold and silver have been moving up because of increased buying orders from jewellers and stockists, ahead of the festive season in the domestic market, and strong global cues.        
	Asian markets, in particular, witnessed a steep rise in gold and silver prices in the last two days following increased volatility on the stock markets.        
	Keeping in mind the ensuing festive and marriage seasons, jewellers and stockists have been placing strong buy orders in the local market, traders said.         
	In north India, Shard  the 15-day period before Durga Puja  is considered as inauspicious. Hence, jewellers and stockists want to pile up their gold stocks before Dhanteras and the marriage season kicks in, said an official of the Indian Bullion Market Association, a national level professional body formed by the regional bullion merchant associations in May this year.         
	Normally, the demand for gold jewellery starts picking up from the month of Ashwin, coinciding with Durga Puja. The marriage season also kicks in then, said an official of city-based Anjali Jewellers.        
	As the countrys largest bullion market in Mumbai was closed today on account of Ganesh Chaturthi, large volumes of gold and silver were traded in other centres such as Calcutta, Chennai and Delhi, increasing the demand for precious metals in these markets.        
	In the international markets, gold price has been surging since August 27. On Thursday, it touched an intraday high of $989.50 per troy ounce on the COMEX in New York.        
	The rise in gold price in the international market is aided by an increased investment demand following a weak dollar and fear of inflation in the wake of economic recovery.

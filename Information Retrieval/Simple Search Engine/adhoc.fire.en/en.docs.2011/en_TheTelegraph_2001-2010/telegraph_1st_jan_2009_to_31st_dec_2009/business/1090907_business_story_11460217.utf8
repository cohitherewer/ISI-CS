The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | RBI favours fewer mutual schemes
                                                                                                               RBI favours fewer mutual schemes
          VIVEK NAIR                                           
	Mumbai, Sept. 6: The Reserve Bank of India wants to limit the number of schemes that mutual fund houses can float to quell the confusion in the minds of retail investors who are bewildered by the profusion of choice.         
	The RBI  which isnt really a regulator for the mutual fund industry  has suggested that the number of schemes that a mutual fund can float should be linked to its net-owned funds, which include paid-up equity capital and reserves.        
	In its annual report that was released a short while ago, the RBI said some fund houses had floated products with as many as 5,000 variants which had totally confounded retail investors. Agreeing with the RBI view, an analyst said that even in a single fund house, there were multiple schemes of the same kind. Some consolidation in the industry could be effected by linking the number of schemes permitted to the net owned funds, the central bank said.         
	According to the Association of Mutual Funds of India, there are 38 fund houses in the country that have floated over 6,000 schemes under various categories  balanced, growth, dividend, equity-linked savings schemes, liquid, money market and gold exchange traded funds.         
	The RBIs suggestion has rattled the mutual fund industry whose affairs are monitored by Sebi under a set of regulations framed in 1996.         
	The industry opposes the idea of linking the flotation of the number of schemes to net-owned funds. If this is done, a mutual fund will become a quasi-bank (such as an NBFC). A fund plays the role of an intermediator and risks are passed on to the investor, Dhirendra Kumar, CEO of Value Research Online, said.         
	Industry sources say a link with net owned funds will not solve the problems of the industry. Better investor education could help overcome this issue, the source said.         
	The RBI had to spring to the rescue of mutual funds last year in October when the effects of the global recession rippled through India  prompting corporate customers of mutual funds to press for redemptions which led to a sudden outflow of cash from the industry. The combined assets under management of the 38 fund houses in the country shrank 26 per cent in just four months  from Rs 5,43,708.64 crore in August to Rs 4,01,818.97 crore in November 2008.         
	At that time, the RBI was forced to hold a 14-day securities repurchase auction to raise Rs 20,000 crore so that banks could funnel cash to shore up the finances of mutual funds. The banking regulator also took a number of steps to ease the crisis by permitting banks to extend loans to mutual funds and accept short-term debt securities issued by lenders as collateral.         
	After that rescue act last year  and after staving off a crisis within the banking industry itself  the RBI is now offering a few solutions to fix the problems that it reckons the mutual fund industry is facing. But its overtures have been met with suspicion and disapproval. For one thing, the mutual industry sees no reason to complain, now that its assets under management have swelled to a historic Rs 7,49,915.52 crore in the month of August.         
	But the central bank isnt convinced by these numbers since it is a sign that the corporate customers have started shovelling their cash into mutual funds once again  which isnt going to provide a measure of stability to the industry. At the first sign of trouble, these clients will pull their money out of the schemes.         
	The central bank wants the mutual funds to not only broaden their investor base but also focus more on retail investors. According to the RBI, one of the key issues facing the sector is its high dependence on corporate clients, which industry sources admit.         
	A high dependence on corporates for funds implies a lesser role for retail investors. Moreover, it makes the funds more volatile as corporate and other institutional investors can withdraw funds at a short notice, the central bank has said in its annual report.         
	Unlike corporate investors, the retail investors do not withdraw funds at a short notice. They are patient even in challenging times, an analyst said.         
	Fund houses agree with this observation but theres very little they can do about this because retail investors have remained cool to the idea of parking their money in mutual fund schemes that have a very large exposure to volatile stock markets. Value Researchs Kumar said a reason could be a preference for bank deposits or small saving instruments.        
	The mutual fund houses continue to focus on schemes such as liquid and money market schemes targeted at corporate clients. The RBI says though the share of equity-oriented schemes has risen in recent times, they still account for less than 25 per cent of the assets of the industry.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Vasan: Bringing cheer                                  
	New Delhi, July 1: The government will clear six port projects worth Rs 3,319.14 crore over the next 100 days. Of the six, two will go to Paradip port to develop terminals for iron ore and coal.        
	Six projects under the public-private partnership model will be awarded in the next 100 days, Union shipping minister G.K. Vasan said.        
	The Paradip Port Trust today signed an agreement with a consortium led by the Hong Kong-based Nobel group for an iron ore terminal at a cost of Rs 591 crore.         
	The consortium will give 36.8 per cent of the revenue to the port during the 30-year concession period, K. Raghuramaiah, chairman of the Paradip Port Trust, said.         
	Gammon Infrastructure Projects and MMTC are the other partners in the consortium. While the construction of the terminal will cost Rs 506.30 crore, the port will spend another Rs 85.05 crore to provide support facilities such as dredging.         
	The project will add 10mt capacity to the port, Raghuramaiah said.        
	The coal terminal will come up at an investment of Rs 479.01 crore with a capacity of 10 million tonnes.        
	Projects will also be awarded to the Tuticorin port in Tamil Nadu, Mormugao port in Goa, Mangalore port in Karnataka and Ennore port near Chennai.

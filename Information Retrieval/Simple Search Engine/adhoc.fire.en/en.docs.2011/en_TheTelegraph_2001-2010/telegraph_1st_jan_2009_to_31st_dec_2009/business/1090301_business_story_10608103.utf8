The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Jet fuel turns cheaper
                                                                                                               Jet fuel turns cheaper
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Feb. 28: State-run oil retailers today slashed jet fuel prices by a further 7 per cent, making it the 11th reduction since September last year.        
	However, the cut is unlikely to bring down airfares. According to airline officials, fares charged by aviation companies barely cover the costs and there is little scope for reduction.        
	Cut in airfare seems unlikely, but we would still examine it, said a senior Jet Airways official.        
	Aviation turbine fuel (ATF) prices in Delhi were slashed by Rs 2,052 to Rs 27,106 per kilolitre, effective midnight tonight, an official of Indian Oil Corporation, the nations largest fuel retailer, said.        
	In Mumbai, home to the nations busiest airport, ATF rates were down to Rs 27,861 from Rs 29,985.19. Calcutta continues to be the costliest with prices coming down to Rs 34,847 from Rs 36,989. In Chennai it is priced at Rs 30317.31 per kl.        
	But for the one-off 3.3 per cent increase in rates on January 16, jet fuel prices are declining in tandem with the fall in international oil rates.        
	The reduction in jet fuel prices announced today would vary from airport to airport, depending on local taxes and levies and on an average worked out to Rs 2,125 per kl.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | RIL denies role in gas pact
                                                                                                               RIL denies role in gas pact
          OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT                          Salve: Points to ponder                                  
	New Delhi, Oct. 20: Reliance Industries today told the Supreme Court that the company was not bound by the gas-sharing arrangement between the Ambani brothers and that Anil should sue Mukesh if he was aggrieved by any of his elder brothers actions.         
	You want to sue your brother, sue him. Dont get the company and the companies act into it, RIL counsel Harish N. Salve said on the first day of arguments on the five petitions in the gas row between the two brothers.         
	Salve said Reliance and its shareholders were different from the owner Mukesh Ambani, and the 2005 family arrangement was never cleared by RILs reconstituted board.         
	When you are dealing with a company, you look at the scheme and the company. You cant bring in private remedies, he said, giving a background of the row to a three-judge bench, headed by Chief Justice K.G. Balakrishnan.        
	Salve argued that gas exploration and production was an expensive proposition, rejecting the gas price fixed in the family arrangement. He also drew the courts attention to the prevailing high prices in the international market.         
	The RIL counsel said it was RNRL that had insisted that the government should not trust Reliance with gas and wanted a policy that would set priority areas for the sale of gas and a specified minimum price. Now RNRL was going back on it, he said.         
	The three-judge bench said the battle seemed to be between individuals and not shareholders.         
	Observing that the share-holder base of the two companies was almost the same, the bench said: When countries fight, the people dont fight, it is only their heads who fight. In this case too, it seems the fight is between the heads, the court observed. It seems to have later percolated down to shareholders.         
	Arguments in the case will continue in the next few days, when RNRL, the government and NTPC Ltd are likely to spell out their stand on the row.         
	RNRL today said it would oppose the governments application in the case. The government had insisted that its pricing policy was binding on all gas producers and sellers.        
	The Mukesh Ambani group had refused to supply gas to RNRL at a price fixed on the basis of a pact between the brothers.         
	But RNRL had gone to Bombay High Court challenging the RIL decision and got a favourable ruling. Reliance then moved the Supreme Court against the high court order.

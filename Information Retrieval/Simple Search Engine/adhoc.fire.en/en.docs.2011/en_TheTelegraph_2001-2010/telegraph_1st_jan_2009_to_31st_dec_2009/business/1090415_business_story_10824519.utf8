	New Delhi/Mumbai, April 14: Infotech majors TCS, Infosys and Wipro are likely to report lower profits and revenues for the January-March 2009 quarter because of weak demand, pressure on prices, volatile currencies and rising competition from global rivals such as IBM.         
	The fourth quarter will be the first quarter of revenue declines (even in constant currency terms) across the board. Pricing should come under further pressure  a trend likely to continue over the next few quarters, said Surendra Goyal and Vishal Agarwal, analysts with Citigroup Global Markets.         
	Analysts Sanjeev Kaushik and Yogesh Aggarwal of HSBC have forecast a 2.5 per cent decline in software industrys revenues for the fourth quarter of 2008-09.        
	Infosys will kickstart the quarterly earnings season tomorrow followed by Wipro, HCL Tech and TCS.        
	Investors will keenly watch the outlook Infosys offers for the current quarter and the year as a whole.        
	The guidance will provide a direction to the market in the immediate term. If Infosys disappoints, stocks can take a hit tomorrow and thereafter stay in a narrow range, an analyst with a foreign brokerage said.        
	Some IT analysts have forecast a flat to low single-digit growth in dollar terms, while others expect the dollar guidance to be lower by up to 2 per cent. Anurag Purohit and Hitesh Punjabi of Religare Hichens Harrison said Infosys could guide towards a minus 2 per cent to a zero per cent growth in dollar revenues.         
	Motilal Oswal Securities has forecast that Infosys could project an up to 3 per cent drop in dollar revenues for the current year.         
	If the company does indeed project a de-growth in dollar revenues, stocks could take a hit, an analyst said.        
	Edelweiss Securities sees a 7.7 per cent fall in earnings for the March quarter over the preceding three-month period. Revenue on an average is seen declining 1.6 per cent.         
	Regarding other infotech majors, brokerage CLSA Asia-Pacific Markets expects TCS to report a 4.3 per cent dip in net profit over the October-December quarter, while Angel Broking sees TCSs earnings contract 2.7 per cent. TCSs revenue is expected to increase by 0.7 per cent.        
	Citigroup sees Wipros fourth-quarter profit rising 10 per cent over the October-December period, while Motilal Oswal Securities sees it declining by 14 per cent. Sales are seen rising 0.5 per cent on an average. Analysts see quarterly profit of HCL falling 33 per cent from the preceding three months, but revenue rising 15 per cent.

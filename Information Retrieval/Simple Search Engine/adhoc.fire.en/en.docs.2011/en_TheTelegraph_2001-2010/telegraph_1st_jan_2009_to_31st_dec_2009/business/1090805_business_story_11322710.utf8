	Calcutta, Aug. 4: Bharti Airtel plans to double the number of service centres in rural Bengal by March 2010.        
	We hope to take the number to 1,500 from 700. Initially, these centres will provide services for mobile telephony and will gradually extend services for each and every product that Airtel offers, chief executive officer and joint managing director Manoj Kohli told The Telegraph.        
	Airtel  which has 25 per cent of its over 100 million subscribers from rural and semi-urban (population less than 20,000) areas  aims to become the leader in the rural markets by March 2010.        
	These areas have very low mobile penetration and holds good growth potential. Many people in rural areas have picked up a mobile handset, not a landline, as their first phone, Kohli said.         
	At present, Bharti covers over 75 per cent of the six lakh villages in the country.        
	We are growing at 28-29 per cent in subscriber addition each month, chief executive officer (Bengal and Orissa) Deepak Srivastava said.        
	Bharti has entered into an agreement with the Bhutan government for creating a terrestrial cable network in that country.         
	Northeast calling        
	Bharti will spend about Rs 600 crore to ramp up its networks in Assam and the Northeast in 2009-10.         
	The company has invested about Rs 1,800 crore in the two circles since 2005.

          OUR CORRESPONDENT                                              DISTANCE NO BAR      
	New Delhi, Feb. 2: Long-distance phone tariff is set to take a tumble with the government allowing customers to buy calling cards from service providers of their choice.        
	The Telecom Commission  the apex decision-making body of the department of telecom  today approved the measure, which gave a customer the freedom to use any calling card to make a long-distance call using his existing phone number.        
	At present, its the service provider, mobile or fixed-line, which selects the long-distance operator, and the customer has to go by its tariff plan. For example, if a subscriber has an Airtel or a Vodafone connection, he has to make his long-distance call through that operator only and pay tariffs accordingly.         
	Under the new regime, if an Airtel customer finds a BSNL tariff plan attractive, he can buy a pre-paid long-distance calling card from BSNL for a specific duration and use it to make STD and ISD calls from his Airtel number.         
	Sudipto Basu, an independent telecom analyst, feels this will increase competition in the long-distance segment and bring down STD-ISD charges by up to 70 per cent.        
	The move will allow stand-alone long-distance call providers such as AT amp;T, BT and Verizon to offer attractive rates to individuals who will now be free to use their services, much like what happens in countries such as the US.                                 
	The freedom to choose an operator of ones choice will increase competition in the long-distance segment and bring down STD and ISD rates.                     
	According to telecom analyst Sudipto Basu, long-distance tariffs may be brought down by up to 70 per cent.         
	The move is expected to prompt stand-alone long-distance service providers such as AT amp;T, BT and Verizon to offer very low rates, Basu said.                           
	Internationally, calling cards offered by a large number of long-distance operators have led to a tariff reduction of over 20-53 per cent.                    
	At present, mobile and fixed line operators decide the long-distance service providers for customers. This prevents consumers from opting for cheaper long-distance tariff plans offered by other service providers.                                
	On punching in a set of numbers specified in the package, the subscriber gets connected to the BSNL network, and then can proceed to make the long-distance call and talk for as long as the pre-paid package permits.         
	Currently, if a subscriber has a Airtel, Vodafone or BSNL fixed or mobile phone connection, he has to make his long distance calls through that operator and pay the prescribed tariffs.         
	Moreover, a BSNL STD or ISD virtual calling card cannot be used to make a long distance calls using an Airtel or Vodafone telephone.        
	In August, TRAI had recommended allowing consumers to buy calling cards directly from the STD and ISD operators in the country. Todays decision will put a seal of approval on the regulators recommendation.         
	Top officials said this decision was likely to be implemented before the end of the month.

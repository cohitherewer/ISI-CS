The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Sops to lessen export woes
                                                                                                               Sops to lessen export woes
										      R. SURYAMURTHY                                    
	New Delhi, June 17: The government is planning incentives for recession-hit exporters, especially for those in the labour-intensive gems and jewellery, textiles and leather industries.        
	Commerce secretary Rahul Khullar said, We have to ensure that our exporters do not lose market share just because rival companies from other countries have captured the market with the help of incentives offered to them.        
	Some of the incentives for exporters would be in the budget. The foreign trade policy to be announced in August will provide a direction and focus for the next five years, a senior commerce ministry official said.        
	An interest subsidy and a special package for the labour-intensive industries are likely to be considered by finance minister Pranab Mukherjee in his budget proposal.        
	As part of the pre-budget consultations with the finance ministry, the commerce ministry had pressed for measures to reduce the input cost of exporters.        
	Officials said the commerce ministry could ask the finance ministry to extend the 2 per cent interest subsidy to more sectors and increase duty drawbacks.        
	Mukherjee had extended the interest subvention (subsidy) on pre- and post-shipment credit for certain employment-oriented sectors till September 30 in the interim budget, resulting in an additional financial outgo of Rs 500 crore.         
	The relief was for select sectors such as textiles (including handloom amp; handicraft), carpets, leather, gems and jewellery, marine products and SMEs.        
	The government has already given sops to exporters and we want it to be expanded further for the plantation industries, apart from labour-intensive units, officials said.        
	The government is also planning to exempt textiles from service tax, cut rates on pre- and post-shipment credit and facilitate a faster clearance of tax arrears.        
	R.K. Dalmia, president of the Confederation of Indian Textile Industry, said, We have asked for an increase of at least 5 per cent in duty drawback rates. In the case of garments, the rate should be raised from 10 per cent to 15 per cent, while on other textile products, it should be increased from 5 per cent to 10 per cent.        
	Duty drawback is the duty rebate on any imported material used by exporters.         
	A. Sakthivel, president of the Federation of Indian Export Organisations, said exporters were receiving more enquiries on their products, but pricing was a major issue.

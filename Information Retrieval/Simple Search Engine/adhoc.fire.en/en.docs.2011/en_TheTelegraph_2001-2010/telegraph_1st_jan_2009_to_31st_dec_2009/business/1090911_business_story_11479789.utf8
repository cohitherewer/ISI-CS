The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | GM decides to sell Opel to Magna
                                                                                                               GM decides to sell Opel to Magna
                            
	Berlin/ Frankfurt, Sept. 10 (Reuters): US car maker General Motors has decided to sell Opel to a group led by Canadian car parts maker Magna, ending months of uncertainty over the European units fate.        
	GM expects to sign a definitive agreement within a few weeks and predicted the deal could close in a few months.        
	At a news conference in Berlin, German Chancellor Angela Merkel welcomed the decision, saying it offered Opel a new beginning and that conditions attached to the sale were manageable and negotiable.        
	I am very happy about this decision, said Merkel, who had supported the Russia-backed Magna bid over a rival offer from Belgium-listed financial investor RHJ International.The governments patience and purpose has paid off. It was not an easy path.        
	Talks on Opel, which GM is selling as part of the US government-orchestrated restructuring, have dragged on for months, fuelling anger among its 50,000 European workers, half of whom are in Germany.        
	Magna, backed by a Russian state-owned bank, had been competing against Brussels-listed financial investor RHJ International, but Germany had refused to back that bid with financing guarantees.        
	Merkel has promised 4.5 billion euros ($6.6 billion) in government guarantees if GM opted for Magna and its Russian backers. GMs decision represented a victory for Merkel only weeks before she tries to win a second term in a federal election. My analysis is that it helps Merkel, said Gerd Langguth, political scientist at Bonn University.

                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Small towns hold key to Acer success
          SOUNAK MITRA                          Expansion time                                  
	Calcutta, Dec. 27: Personal computer maker Acer, which is eyeing the No. 1 spot in the domestic market by the end of next year, plans to expand its retail presence in smaller towns.        
	We plan to grow to over 350 stores by the end of 2010 with expansion on the retail front primarily focussed on the tier-II and tier-III cities, S. Rajendran, chief marketing officer of Acer India, said.        
	At present, its retail business is divided into IT speciality stores and large-format stores.         
	Acer has over 275 outlets in India under the brand names of Acer malls (exclusive Acer stores) and Acer points (sales outlets in multi-brand stores). Acer has a retail presence in over 140 cities.        
	During the third quarter of this year, the companys market share in notebooks has almost doubled to 15.2 per cent from 8.9 per cent in the first quarter, thanks to the strategy of having sales points in large stores. Market shares in PCs have doubled to almost 10 per cent during the third quarter from 5.5 per cent in the first quarter.        
	At present, Acer is present in over 150 of these stores across major chains such as Croma, eZone, Vijay Sales, HyperCITY, Jumbo Electronics, Staples and Reliance.         
	Acer in India should be contributing to around 2-3 per cent of our global turnover. This number should increase as we scale up next year and target the numero uno position in India, Rajendran said.        
	According to him, the company has been recording strong month-on-month growth since April.         
	We also focussed our energies on segments not affected from recession such as public sector units, education, government projects, he said.

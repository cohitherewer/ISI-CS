The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Ranbaxy on profit path
                                                                                                               Ranbaxy on profit path
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                                            
	New Delhi, Oct. 26: Ranbaxy Laboratories today reported a consolidated profit after tax of Rs 1,16.6 crore for the third quarter ended September 30 against a loss of Rs 394.5 crore in the same period last year.        
	The turnaround was driven by consistent sales in the emerging markets and cost-cutting measures. Revenue growth in some strategic markets and a sharp focus on cost efficiency have been the underlying themes this quarter. With good achievements on these fronts, we are confident that we are on the path to recovery, Atul Sobti, CEO and managing director of Ranbaxy Laboratories, said through a teleconference from Tokyo.         
	Consolidated net sales, however, fell 18 per cent to Rs 1,720.5 crore from Rs 1,888.4 crore a year ago. Net sales in the second quarter were higher at Rs 1,795.3 crore.         
	Company sources said overall sales had come down because of selling restrictions in the US. Ranbaxy has not been able to sell its products in the US because of the import alert given by the USFDA (US Food and Drug Administration). Consequently, this had an impact on our overall sales in the third quarter, bringing them down.The US is a major market for us. The company continues to cooperate with the USFDA towards early resolution of observations made by the regulator, the sources said.        
	A 53 per cent reduction in sales in the US to Rs 213.8 crore has pulled down earnings from the developed markets by about 30 per cent to Rs 525.7 crore. The emerging markets  Asia, the CIS countries, Latin America and Africa  account for 62 per cent of Ranbaxys revenues. Sales from these regions were almost the same at Rs 1,067.8 crore.

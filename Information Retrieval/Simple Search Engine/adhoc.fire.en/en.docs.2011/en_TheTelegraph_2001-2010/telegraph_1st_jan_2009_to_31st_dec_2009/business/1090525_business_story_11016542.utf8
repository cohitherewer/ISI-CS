The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Indian stitch on Obama suit
                                                                                                               Indian stitch on Obama suit
                          Tailor-made				                           
	Chicago, May 24 (PTI): The bankrupt US suit maker Hartmarx Corporation, whose clientele include US President Barack Obama, is likely to be revived under a new Indian owner  S. Kumars Nationwide Limited (SKNL).        
	Textile firm S. Kumars is close to acquiring Hartmarx Corporation jointly with London-based private equity firm Emerisque Brands for $119 million.        
	Hartmarx Corporation said in a statement on May 22 that it had entered into a stalking horse asset purchase agreement with Emerisque Brands UK Limited and SKNL North America, an arm of S. Kumars Nationwide for all the assets of Hartmarx.        
	A stalking horse bid is an attempt by a debtor to maximise the value of its assets as part of or before a bankruptcy court-approved auction process.        
	The American clothing company said it had filed motions last Thursday with the Bankruptcy Court for the Northern District of Illinois with the aim of preserving the maximum value for all stakeholders.        
	Under the terms of the agreement, subject to court approval, the buyer will acquire substantially all of the assets for $70.5 million in cash and a junior secured note with a face value of $15 million. Also, it has agreed to assume certain liabilities of Hartmarx estimated to be about $33.5 million.         
	We are very pleased to have taken this first yet very important step in resolving the future of Hartmarx as a continuing enterprise. In this challenging economic environment, the Emerisque offer is the best we have received, Hartmarx chairman and chief executive officer Homi B. Patel said.        
	On January 23, Hartmarx and 50 of its wholly owned US subsidiaries filed voluntary petitions for protection under chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code.        
	Meanwhile, according to a report by Chicago Tribune, The purchase agreement sets the bid floor for a potential auction of Chicago-based Hartmarx that could come as soon as June 30 and be wrapped up in mid-July.        
	Hartmarx is the largest maker of mens tailored clothing in the US and made the tuxedo, topcoat and suit that the 47-year-old Obama wore on his inauguration on January 20.

          A STAFF REPORTER                          CAREFUL STEPS                                  
	Calcutta, April 19: Standard Chartered Bank (StanChart) is treading with caution in its loan dealings with small and medium enterprises (SMEs).         
	The banks non-performing assets in the unsecured loan portfolio vis-a-vis SMEs have increased around 40 per cent in the last two quarters.        
	We will be more disciplined in disbursing unsecured loans to the SMEs, Rakesh Singh, StanChart general manager (SME banking), said. The bank plans to reduce the share of unsecured loans in the SME portfolio from 30 per cent in the last calendar year to about 20 per cent by December 2009.        
	StanChart has about 15,000 borrowers in the unsecured SME segment. SME accounts comprise one-third of the total asset portfolio of the banks consumer banking division.        
	This year the bank targets to register 30 per cent growth in SME lending on a year-on-year basis against 50 per cent last year. It has also started restructuring several SME accounts by increasing the tenure of repayment and reducing the interest rates.        
	The bank is now focusing on health, education, infrastructure and food processing for SME lending.         
	Rising defaults in textiles, gems and jewellery and engineering goods in the last few months have prompted the bank to identify new segments.        
	Apart from unsecured loans, trade working capital accounts for 30 per cent and liabilities from transaction deals amount to 40 per cent of the banks SME portfolio.

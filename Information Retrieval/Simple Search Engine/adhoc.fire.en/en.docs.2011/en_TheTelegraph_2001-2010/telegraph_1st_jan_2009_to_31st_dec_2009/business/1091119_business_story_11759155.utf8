                              Sweet tidings                            
	Philadelphia/Milan, Nov. 18 (Reuters): Chocolate makers Hershey Co and Ferrero SpA are considering a joint bid for Cadbury Plc that can help the British confectioner fend off a hostile takeover by Kraft Foods Inc.         
	A source familiar with the talks between US-based Hershey and Italys Ferrero said the discussions between the two sides were very preliminary. Very early in the process.        
	Hershey executives have been more aggressive about pursuing a deal, but financial details have not been discussed and no offer has been made, the Wall Street Journal reported.        
	The talks are the strongest sign yet of a possible rival bid to Krafts $16.7-billion offer, which Cadbury rejected and said was derisory.        
	Another person familiar with the situation said Cadbury had not been contacted by Ferrero but would consider any attractive offer. Analysts and traders said there was a possibility that such an alliance might emerge and pose a viable defence against Kraft.        
	Cadbury has heard nothing from Ferrero or people acting for it. Cadbury is not up for sale, but the company would give proper consideration to any offer that valued it properly and would be of interest to shareholders, the person said.        
	Ferrero and Cadbury both declined to comment. Hershey and Hershey Trust officials could not immediately be reached. Although Cadburys assets are very attractive, it doesnt appear that either Ferrero or Hershey is in the financial position of taking on Cadbury all by themselves, said Erin Swanson, an equity analyst with Morningstar.        
	Hershey shares slipped 6 cents to $38.35 in extended trading on Tuesday following news of its talks with Ferrero.        
	Cadbury shares had earlier closed up 0.8 per cent at 788 pence on Tuesday, while Kraft gained 1 cent to $27.64.        
	According to Italian business daily Il Sole 24 Ore, Ferrero could join financial investors and private equity players considered friendly to Cadbury for a possible alliance. We believe if this scenario was proposed as a potential defence measure by Cadbury, the potential value the market might be prepared to award it would not be materially different from that of a revised Kraft offer, Nomura analyst Alex Smith said of a Cadbury-Ferrero combination.

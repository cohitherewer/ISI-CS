	New Delhi, Dec. 7: ONGC Videsh is in talks for a refinery in Nigeria.        
	In our efforts to broad-base our activities, OVL, the overseas investment arm of Oil and Natural Gas Corporation Ltd, is discussing the setting up of a greenfield refinery in Nigeria, said petroleum minister Murli Deora at the second India-Africa hydrocarbon conference organised by Ficci.        
	While Deora refused to divulge details, senior officials said he was referring to the proposal of ONGC Videsh (OVL) to build a 1,80,000 barrels-per-day refinery with steel baron Lakshmi N. Mittal in return for oil blocks.        
	ONGC-Mittal Energy Ltd (Omel), the joint venture between ONGC Videsh and Mittal Investment Sarl, landed two Nigerian blocks  OPL 285 and OPL 279  in the 2006 round of bidding in return for commitments either in power, rail or refining.         
	Omel is the operator of the two blocks.         
	OPL-285 is a deep-water block, where Omel, through Omel Energy Nigeria, holds 64.33 per cent interest.         
	The other partners in the block are Nigerian company Emo (10 per cent), and French firm Total (25.67 per cent interest).         
	In OPL 276, Total has a 14.5 per cent interest. Deora said India was keen to buy liquefied natural gas from Africa.        
	We are a stable, long-term and growing market for Africas natural gas. Our companies are interested in sourcing LNG as well as equity participation in existing and upcoming LNG terminals in Africa, said Deora.        
	Indian companies are keen to participate in the exploration and production opportunities in Angola, Ghana, Sudan, Nigeria, Uganda and Cte dIvoire, he said.

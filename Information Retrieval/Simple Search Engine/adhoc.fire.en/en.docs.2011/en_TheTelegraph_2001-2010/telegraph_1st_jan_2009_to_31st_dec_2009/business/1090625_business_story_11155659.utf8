The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Monsoon cloud over turnaround
                                                                                                               Monsoon cloud over turnaround

	New Delhi/Mumbai, June 24: The spectre of poor rains is posing the first real threat to the UPA governments effort to put the economy back on track.        
	The national met office today predicted that rainfall this year would be 93 per cent of the average, or below normal, against an earlier forecast of 96 per cent.        
	A weak monsoon could raise food prices and hurt rural income, a key driver of demand.         
	It could force the government to spend more on large public works programmes to employ farmers, who might find themselves out of work. This is at a time when policy-makers are devising strategies to keep the fiscal deficit in check.        
	Economists say the planting of kharif crops such as sugarcane, rice and soya bean can take a hit, pushing up food prices, which have remained high despite bumper wheat and rice crops last year.        
	Prices of food articles have risen over 8 per cent, though the inflation rate has recently turned negative.        
	The silver lining is that the 2009 monsoon rainfall will be 93 per cent of the long-term average, which does not really mean a great problem for farming. What has to be seen is the spatial distribution of this rain, said finance ministry officials.         
	Agriculture employs about 60 per cent of the population and contributes about 17 per cent to the gross domestic product.        
	Bank of Barodas chief economist Rupa Rege Nitsure said it was too early to raise the alarm, and a proper assessment of the situation was only possible at the end of August.         
	Crisils principal economist D.K. Joshi said it was too early to arrive at a conclusion. He said the distribution pattern was important.         
	The problem, government officials say, is that the rains in the grain bowls of Punjab, Haryana and western Uttar Pradesh  the northwest region  can be as little as 82 per cent of the average.        
	However, the government is not pressing the panic button as yet.        
	It is possible the monsoon is delayed by a couple of weeks, but its not going to impact the economy much, Planning Commission deputy chairman Montek Singh Ahluwalia said.         
	Economists say the farm growth rate will fall to 1 per cent from an expected 2.2 per cent if the rains were 10 per cent below normal, pushing down GDP to 5.5 per cent against forecasts of 7 per cent for this fiscal.        
	Stock-brokers said shares of companies dependent on the rural sector such as fast moving consumer goods, two-wheelers and tractors were vulnerable.        
	Electricity consultant S.K. Ghosh said that poor rains did not bode well for the sector.

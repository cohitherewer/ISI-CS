	Calcutta, May 29: NTPC will invest Rs 55,000 crore in the next three years to augment its generation capacity to over 40,000MW by the end of the Eleventh Five Year Plan.         
	Our capacity addition target for the Eleventh Plan (2007-2012) is 22,430MW and, of this, 2,740MW have already been commissioned, said R.S. Sharma, chairman and managing director of NTPC.         
	The state-run power generating company generated 27,850MW from its own power plants and another 2,294MW through different joint ventures till the end of March this year. At present, construction work is on for projects having an aggregate generating capacity of 18,000MW. Of this, 3,300MW will be commissioned in the current financial year, Sharma said.         
	However, in the last financial year, the company could commission only 1,000MW against a target of 2,800MW.        
	NTPC will invest Rs 17,700 crore for 3,300MW capacity addition in 2009-10.         
	Sharma said the debt-equity component of the companys planned investment would be in the ratio of 70:30. The entire equity capital (that is, Rs 16,500 crore) will come from NTPCs internal accruals. As for debt capital, we have already agreements with financial institutions for a loan of Rs 25,000 crore, he said, while replying to a question whether NTPC would need to tap the capital market with an equity issue for the second time. Till March this year, NTPC had reserves of Rs 49,124.60 crore.         
	NTPC today signed the fuel supply agreement with Coal India, under which the latter will supply 114.7mt coal to its 15 thermal power stations.               
	With the addition of 22,430MW generating capacity in the Eleventh Plan, NTPC aims at sales revenue of Rs 75,000 crore by March 2012. In 2008-09, the company clocked a revenue of Rs 44,126 crore.        
	This FSA with all its commercial terms and conditions will be a model agreement for all other power generating companies, said Parth S. Bhattacharyya, chairman and managing director, Coal India Ltd.        
	The FSA entails penalty/incentive clauses, among other things, for short-supply as well as short-lifting of coal by CIL and the power generating company. Accordingly, CIL will be bound to supply a minimum of 90 per cent of the contracted coal amount failing which it will have to pay a penalty to the coal buyer and the power generating company will have to lift at least 90 per cent of the coal contracted for or pay a penalty to CIL. The penalty amount will vary from 10 per cent to 40 per cent of the annual contracted value to the extent of the shortfall.

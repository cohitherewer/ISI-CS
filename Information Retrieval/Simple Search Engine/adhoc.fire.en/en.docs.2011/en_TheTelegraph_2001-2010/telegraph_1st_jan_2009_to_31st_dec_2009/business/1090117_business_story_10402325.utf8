          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Mumbai, Jan. 16: Private carrier Jet Airways has reported a net loss of Rs 214.18 crore for the third quarter ended December 31, 2008, compared with Rs 91.12 crore in the year-ago period.         
	The airlines total income, however, rose 24.60 per cent to Rs 3,022.83 crore during the quarter from Rs 2,425.98 crore in the corresponding period a year ago. The company suffered losses mainly on account of high fuel prices and other operating costs and lower load factors resulting in lower-than-expected revenues, Jet Airways said in a statement.         
	During the quarter, expenditure rose to Rs 3,106.89 crore from Rs 2492.15 crore in the corresponding period of the previous year.         
	For the nine months ended December 31, 2008, Jet Airways reported a net loss of Rs 455.33 crore against Rs 31.88 crore in the same period a year ago. Total income increased around 49 per cent to Rs 9,011.33 crore         
	Jet Airways forecast that lower oil prices had reduced pressure on costs in the short term and current apex fares introduced by the airline was expected to stimulate demand in the domestic market.

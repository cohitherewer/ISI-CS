	New Delhi, Aug. 7: Union steel minister Virbhadra Singh today said the government expected to raise about Rs 15,000 crore by selling stakes in two public sector companies.        
	Though the minister did not name the companies, officials said the two firms identified for divestment were Manganese Ore (India) Ltd (MOIL) and National Mining Development Corporation Ltd (NMDC).        
	Singh, who was speaking at a seminar organised by the Indian Chamber of Commerce, said, Two PSUs in the steel sector have been identified for the governments divestment programme. We will send a proposal to the cabinet within this month.         
	Officials said Steel Authority of India Ltd could also issue fresh shares in the market at an appropriate time.         
	The government is planning to sell up to 8.38 per cent in NMDC, which can fetch the exchequer around Rs 12,000 crore.         
	NMDC has chalked out an investment programme of about Rs 26,000 crore for the next five years. Besides expanding its sponge iron capacity, it is planning to set up a steel plant. The public offer is likely to be a mix of government equity and fresh shares.         
	Officials said the government had also decided to list MOIL by issuing around 10 per cent of its shares to the public. However, the government will first make a 1:5 bonus issue and reduce the face value of the shares from Rs 100 to Rs 10 apiece. Around 3.36 million shares will be issued to the public.        
	Singh said his ministry was looking at various options to curb iron ore exports. But he refused to give a timeline or a definite course of action.        
	I feel the time has come to seriously ponder over this issue. It is better that we export finished products rather than iron ore and other things, which are of lower value, Singh said.        
	We should try to conserve our stockpile of ore as much as possible for the future, so that we derive maximum benefit to the country on a long-term basis, he said.        
	On whether the government is contemplating a partial or a complete ban, the minister said, We have got many options before us. We are considering them.

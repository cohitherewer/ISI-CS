          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Hyderabad April 6: The CBI is all set to file a chargesheet against the main accused in the Satyam Computer scam.        
	CBI officials said the chargesheet would be filed in a CBI designated court by April 9.         
	After this, the chances of Satyam founder Ramalinga Raju, his brother and former MD Rama Raju and former chief financial officer V. Srinivas getting bail will be remote. Their bail applications have been rejected four times, and judicial custody extended seven times since their arrest on January 11.        
	However, S. Gopalakrishnan and Talluri Srinivas, the Price Waterhouse duo who audited Satyam, may get bail tomorrow.        
	Meanwhile the CBI today arrested three Satyam officials  G. Ramakrishna, vice-president (finance), D. Venkatapathi Raju and Srisailam  who are in the finance department.        
	CBI DIG V.V. Lakshminarayana, who is heading the probe, said the trio were involved in forging invoices and fixed deposits.

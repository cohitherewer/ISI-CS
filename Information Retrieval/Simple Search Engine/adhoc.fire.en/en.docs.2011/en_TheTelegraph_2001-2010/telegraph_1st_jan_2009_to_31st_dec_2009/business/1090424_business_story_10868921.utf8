          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                                  
	Mumbai, April 23: Reliance Industries  the countrys largest private sector company  has reported a 9.4 per cent year-on-year fall in net profit at Rs 3,546 crore during the fourth quarter ended March 31.         
	Profits shrank because lower crude oil prices badly crimped refining margins even as the demand for petrochemical products dipped.        
	Reliance posted a 24.9 per cent decline in turnover in the last quarter of 2008-09 at Rs 29,073 crore against Rs 38,697 crore in the year-ago period.         
	The Mukesh Ambani-controlled company registered an 8.3 per cent increase in turnover for the year ended March 31, 2009 at Rs 1,50,771 crore against Rs 1,39,269 crore in 2007-08. Net profit, excluding exceptional items, rose 2.3 per cent for 2008-09 to Rs 15,607 crore from Rs 15,261 crore in the last year. The gross refining margin for the year was $12.20 per barrel against $15 in the last year.        
	Refinery product cracks witnessed high volatility. The product cracks were very strong during the first half. However, the cracks declined sharply in the second half on the back of lower crude prices and demand contraction, the company said.        
	Earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) for the refining business during this period decreased 6.6 per cent to Rs 9,648 crore reflecting the lower refining margin environment.         
	The petrochemicals business also faced a demand contraction and price correction in the second half.         
	The company has also made a provision of Rs 370 crore for estimated claims on accounts of subsidiaries.         
	Chairman Mukesh Ambani said, This was a transformational year for Reliance. We commissioned our large refinery and substantially completed gas development projects. We have set new global benchmarks for project execution.        
	The RIL share price rose 2.7 per cent on the Bombay Stock Exchange.

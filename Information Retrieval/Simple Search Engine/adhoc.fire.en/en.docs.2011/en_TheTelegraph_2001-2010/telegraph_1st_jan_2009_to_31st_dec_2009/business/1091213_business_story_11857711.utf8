          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                    
	Mumbai, Dec. 12: Volkswagen, the German auto major, today rolled out its first made-in-India car Polo from its plant at Chakan near Pune.        
	The largest car maker in Europe is aiming to capture 8-10 per cent of the local market over the next four to six years as it rolls out new models and expands its distribution network in the country.        
	Volkswagen had invested around 580 million euros, or Rs 3,800 crore, in the Chakan facility, Jochem Heizmann, member of the Volkswagen board of management, said and added that this was the largest investment to date by a German company in India.        
	The Chakan plant has an annual capacity of 1,10,000 units and will be used to manufacture the Skoda Fabia, the Polo hatchback and a sedan to be launched in the second half of next year.        
	With the Polo, Volkswagen is looking to tap the compact car category, which is the most happening segment in the domestic automobile market.        
	Heizmann said the company would like to achieve a localisation target of 80 per cent in the next two to three years. At present, the level of localisation is around 50 per cent. Higher localisation will enable Volkswagen to offer products at competitive prices.        
	Maharashtra chief minister Ashok Chavan, who was present at todays function, said the state government would extend all support to help the car maker achieve its full capacity utilisation at the earliest.

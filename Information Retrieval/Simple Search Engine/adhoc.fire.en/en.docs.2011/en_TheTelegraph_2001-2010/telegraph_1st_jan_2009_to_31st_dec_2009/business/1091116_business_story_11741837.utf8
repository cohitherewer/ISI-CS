        Srikumar Bondyopadhyay offers tips on what to look for in company balance sheets for a balanced portfolio                                        
	A research by Helsinki-based World Institute for Development Economic Research of the United Nations University in 2006 revealed that the average per capita net worth in India was only 24.7 per cent, while the countrys GDP was a third of the world average. The per capita household wealth (value of physical and financial assets minus debt) in the US was $1,43,857 compared with $1,112 in India, according to the study. The Chinese are twice as wealthy ($2,613).         
	Another study by the World Bank in 2005 showed that the per capita financial assets in India in 2000 were $430 compared with $14,000 in Malaysia and $1,500 in China.         
	Go the equity way        
	Now why do we have such a low per capita wealth and net worth though we save more than 30 per cent of our income?         
	Indian households prefer physical assets and opt for financial assets that are secure and offer greater liquidity, such as bank deposits. Since 1999-2000, nearly 53 per cent of the annual household savings have been flowing towards physical assets such as land, house, cars and gold jewellery. The remaining savings find their way mostly into bank deposits and insurance. Equities comprise about 5 per cent of the financial assets of households. This is in sharp contrast to 22 per cent in China and 30-40 per cent in developed countries.        
	Equities are the best option for wealth creation. Historically, equities have given the highest return among all asset classes. A low holding of equities in an average Indian households asset portfolio explains why we have a low per capita net worth.        
	Long-term view        
	Equity investments are fraught with risks. The risks have increased with greater integration of the domestic economy with global economies and higher liquidity after the introduction of derivative markets in India.        
	The long-term trend of stock markets is to move up. This is why investment experts always advise equities for the long term (5 years or more) to abate the effect of short-term volatility on your returns. Look at the chart that reveals that the sensex has closed the year with a loss only thrice  a 30 per cent probability of loss.         
	If you have invested for two years, the probability of suffering a loss will be 10 per cent. If you have invested for five years, you will never make loss.         
	Which stocks to buy        
	Stock selection is key to equity investment. Your choice of stocks should be guided by the value judgement  how much you are paying for it and what value do you expect to get. Thus, a stock is worth buying, irrespective of the market condition, if its market price is less than the inherent value of the stock.         
	Before you know how to determine the intrinsic value of a stock, you should keep in mind that your portfolio should not be very large. It should comprise 10-15 stocks  a large portfolio reduces the return potential. You should identify five sectors that are going to gain the most from the economic development in the future. Once you have identified the sectors, look for two-three value stocks in each sector.         
	How to find a value stock        
	The inherent value of a stock is measured by a combination of several financial ratios. Some of these ratios are provided by individual companies in their financial results, while some you shall have to cull out from their balance sheets. We shall discuss some of the ratios to give you a guideline on stock selection.        
	 Price to book value (P/B): The book value denotes a companys total tangible assets minus its total liabilities. This is the portion of the company that shareholders own.         
	Thus, if the market price of a stock is less than its book value per share, it means that shares are trading at a price lower than what these are worth.         
	 Price-earnings to growth (PEG): You may often find the P/B ratio of a company is greater than one. It is because investors are willing to pay a premium to the (per share) book value as they believe the company will grow its business, earn more profits and create more assets in the future.        
	The price to earnings (P/E) ratio  market price of a stock divided by its earnings per share (EPS)  reflects the premium that investors are willing to pay for the current profitability of the company. An intelligent investor will consider whether this price multiple corresponds to the companys future growth.         
	PEG is P/E divided by the future profit growth rate. The future profit growth rate is subject to an individual investors perception about the company, the industry to which it belongs and the impact of economic growth on the company/industry.         
	In a developing market like ours, a PEG multiple of 1.2 is considered a fair value and anything above that signifies that the stock price is overvalued. These two ratios broadly capture the valuation of a companys stock vis--vis its position in the peer group. However, a low P/B and PEG ratio tells little about whether a company has a sound financial health. So, you shall have to look into the companys balance sheet for some important ratios.        
	n Debt-equity ratio: It is the proportion of total debt to shareholders equity, including reserves, and it determines the indebtedness of the company or how leveraged it is. If a company has a high debt-equity ratio, it will have to shell out a large part of its profit in servicing that debt. Thus, companies with less than one debt-equity ratio are worth investing in.        
	n Current ratio: To know how well capitalised a company is in the short term, divide the current assets by the current liabilities. Companies having a current ratio of more than one are well capitalised to meet short-term obligations. However, a very high current ratio means idle assets that reflects inefficiency of the management.         
	n Quick ratio: Defined as current assets-inventories/ current liabilities, the quick ratio denotes how dependent the company is on its existing inventories and liquid assets. A higher quick ratio compared with other peer group companies implies the company is less dependent on its inventories to meet short-term liabilities and, hence, is better managed than other companies.        
	n Working capital: An important source for a company to fund its day-to-day operations is working capital and it can be measured by the difference between current assets minus current liabilities. The higher the number, the better is the position of the company.         
	Let your money grow through investment in equities. However, to avoid downside risks, make a prudent choice of stocks and equities are sure to be your best bet.

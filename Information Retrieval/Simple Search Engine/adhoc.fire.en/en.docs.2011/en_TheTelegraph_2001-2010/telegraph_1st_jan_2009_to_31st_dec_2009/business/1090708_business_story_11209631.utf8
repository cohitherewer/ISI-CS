          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, July 7: The department of telecom may not be able to build the alternative optic fibre network for defence forces that will allow them to vacate spectrum.         
	The budget has allotted Rs 26 crore for the project, while the DoT needs around Rs 10,000 crore. A bulk of the alternative network, especially that of the Air Force, is close to being completed and government sanction for funds is vital to compensate BSNL and MTNL to ensure timely completion of the project, DoT officials said.         
	The DoT has sought cabinet sanction for Rs 9,970 crore  of which the alternative network for the army will cost Rs 1,077.16 crore and that for the Air force and navy will cost Rs 8,893 crore. We need to see how the cabinet committee on economic affairs responds to the demand, officials said.        
	On the completion of the network, the defence will release 45 megahertz (MHz) of spectrum over three years.        
	The communication system, built by state-owned BSNL and MTNL, would enable defence to release non-utilised spectrum as they switch to the new network.        
	According to analysts, if the government is able to auction more spectrum, its revenue can go up by Rs 10,000-15,000 crore. The government plans to raise Rs 35,000 crore from 3G auction.        
	The additional spectrum will allow operators to add another 100 million subscribers over the next year.         
	The government has set a target of 600 million subscribers by the end of the Eleventh Five-Year Plan in 2012. The telecom sector has over 450 million subscribers now.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                               
	Mumbai, March 9: Mercks acquisition of Schering-Plough has given rise to speculations of an open offer for Fulford India, a subsidiary of the acquired firm.         
	Schering-Plough holds around 54 per cent in Fulford through its arm Dashtag. The change of parent after the buyout has sparked hopes of an open offer.         
	On the Bombay Stock Exchange, the Fulford share ended nearly 3.3 per cent lower at Rs 290.30. Market circles expect the stock to soar when trading resumes on Thursday.         
	Some feel that Merck may not have to make an open offer to acquire 20 per cent from the public because the transaction is in the form of a merger agreement, with Schering-Plough bought in a cash-and-stock deal valued at $41.1 billion.         
	According to Sebi regulations, acquisitions via mergers are not subject to open offer.         
	In India, Merck is present through its subsidiary MSD India. The Rs 190-crore Fulford India has a product range that includes drugs used in the treatment of allergy, cancer, cardiovascular and skin disorders.

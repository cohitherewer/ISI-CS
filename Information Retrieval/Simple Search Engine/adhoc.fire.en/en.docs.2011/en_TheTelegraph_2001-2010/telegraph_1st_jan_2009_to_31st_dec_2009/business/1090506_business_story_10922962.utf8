	L amp;T plans to restructure operations further by creating one operating company each for defence, aerospace and nuclear power.         
	The company will spend up to Rs 2,000 crore in defence-related businesses alone over the next three years.        
	We are getting the blueprint for our Vision 2015 ready. If everything goes right, we will create three operating companies to look after defence, aerospace and nuclear power sectors for effective operations. This may happen in 2012-13, Naik said.

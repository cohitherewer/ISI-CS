The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Cell firms eye value-added offerings
                                                                                                               Cell firms eye value-added offerings

	New Delhi, Oct. 25: Value-added services are the way forward for telecom firms who are seeing falling revenues on account of lower call rates.        
	Analysts said cut-throat competition meant that the price war would continue at the expense of revenues.        
	Nine out of the 14 telecom operators in the country witnessed a 5-8 per cent fall in revenues in the last quarter (July-September), though subscriber additions were 10 million every month. This can be attributed to the slashing of voice tariffs and the introduction of per-second charges by some operators.         
	Every time somebody reduces prices, the competitor also does the same thing because there arent very clear differentiators today, said Romal Shetty, telecom analyst and executive director at consulting firm KPMG.         
	Until a particular operator comes up with differentiated service offerings or customer service, price wars will continue to affect earnings, he said.        
	According to data released by the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India, over the last 12 months  October 2008-September 2009  the industry has witnessed a decline of around 11 per cent in revenues, while adding over 140 million subscribers.        
	The mobile subscriber base has gone up to 427 million as of June 2009 from 287 million in the corresponding period last year.        
	GSM and CDMA services provider Tata Teleservices has recently launched a pay-per-character-SMS scheme called Diet SMS that charges users 1 paise per character. Prior to this innovation, SMS texts had flat rates. These texts contribute 50 per cent to the revenue earned from value-added services. Such technology-based differentiated products, rather than slashing tariff rates, are the way to go forward for telecom firms, Shetty said.         
	Tata Teleservices, which is 26 per cent owned by Japans NTT DoCoMo, plans to have services such as purchasing railway tickets and buying merchandise to drive the share of value-added earning in total revenue to 20 per cent from 14 per cent.        
	According to the analysts, service providers are also developing SMS-based information services on many topics, from mandi rates and weather reports to career counselling and hospitals.        
	With third-generation (3G) mobile services coming soon, service providers will bank on value-added services to bring in additional revenues, said Nitish Mittersain, chief executive officer of Nazara Technologies, a mobile gaming company.        
	The value-added market, worth Rs 6,500 crore at present, constitutes about 10-14 per cent of the revenues of the operators and is expected to touch 40 per cent in the next 3-5 years.

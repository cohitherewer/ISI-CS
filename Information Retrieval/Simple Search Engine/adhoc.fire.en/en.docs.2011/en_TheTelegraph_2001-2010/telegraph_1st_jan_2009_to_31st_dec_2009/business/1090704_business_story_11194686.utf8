The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Anil ups ante in gas case
                                                                                                               Anil ups ante in gas case
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                    
	Mumbai, July 3: The Ambani dispute over gas supplies is headed to the Supreme Court, but it is the younger scion Anil Ambani who has decided to go to the apex court first after Bombay High Court handed down a stunning victory to him.        
	Anil Ambani-owned Reliance Natural Resources Ltd today filed a special leave petition (SLP) in the apex court urging it to direct Reliance Industries to execute a bankable gas supply agreement in line with the high courts order.        
	RNRLs grouse is that representatives of RIL have failed to come to the table and hammer out an agreement. The petition is expected to come up for hearing next week. The SLP is another instance of the sharp differences between the Ambani brothers over gas supplies from the KG basin.         
	A division bench of Bombay High Court had on June 15 directed RIL to honour a 2005 family agreement to supply gas to RNRL at $2.34 per million British thermal units for 17 years.         
	The high court also gave the two firms a months time to work out necessary details.        
	Following this, RNRL had invited RIL for talks, which did not take place. On Wednesday, RIL told the Anil Ambani firm that it would file an appeal in the Supreme Court.        
	Mukul Rohatgi, counsel for RNRL, said the firm was challenging the last part of the direction of Bombay High Court wherein it had asked RNRL to renegotiate with RIL.

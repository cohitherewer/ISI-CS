          AMIT CHAKRABORTY                                            
	Calcutta, Aug. 9: Bengal chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee in a letter to Union textile minister Dayanidhi Maran has sought the continuation of the rule that stipulates compulsory packaging of foodgrains and sugar in jute sacks.        
	According to Bhattacharjee, the Union government should encourage the industry to modernise to ensure a steady supply of sacks.        
	He said the government should consider the enormous importance of jute in the economy, which supports nearly five million people, while forming its policies.        
	Bhattacharjees letter follows a recommendation by the standing advisory committee of the textile ministry to dilute the compulsory jute packaging order for this fiscal.        
	The chief minister called for a long-term policy so that the mills were able to upgrade themselves and focus on value-added exports, besides manufacturing packing materials.         
	The packaging of foodgrains and sugar is reviewed every year.         
	Last year, the government stuck to its 100 per cent packaging order for jute against the committees demand for a 10 per cent dilution.

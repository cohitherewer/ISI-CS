The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | ICICI plans flotations for four group firms
                                                                                                               ICICI plans flotations for four group firms
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          CASH COURSE				                                 
	Mumbai, Aug. 21: ICICI Bank is planning to come out with maiden flotations to unlock the value of its four subsidiaries  ICICI Prudential Life Insurance, ICICI Lombard General Insurance, ICICI Securities and ICICI Home Finance.         
	A spokesperson for the countrys second-largest bank today confirmed that such a plan was being drawn up, but it would take some time to execute.        
	The ICICI group had earlier mulled a listing of ICICI Securities. This was the first time the bank admitted that it was considering taking the other three units public as well.        
	Market circles reckon that ICICI Securities can be the first flotation. ICICI Securities, which is a wholly owned subsidiary of ICICI Bank, had announced plans to come out with a public offering in January 2008. However, the plan was shelved after the stock markets tanked.         
	ICICI Bank holds 74 per cent in ICICI Prudential Life Insurance, with Prudential Plc holding the rest.         
	In ICICI Lombard, Canada-based Fairfax Financial Holdings Ltd holds 26 per cent, and the bank 74 per cent.        
	The insurance entities will be able to come out with flotations only after the government raises the cap on foreign stake to 49 per cent from 26 per cent. A bill in this regard was introduced in Parliament last December. Another rule stipulates that a private insurer can float an IPO only after it has been in operation for 10 years.        
	According to Section 6AA of the Insurance Act, 1938, a promoter holding over 26 per cent in an insurance company will be required to divest in a phased manner after a period of 10 years from the date of commencement of the business or as prescribed by the central government.                    
	It may be recalled that Reliance Capital Ltd is also planning to either list its life insurance arm or induct a strategic partner or both. The Anil Ambani group company is now learnt to have approached the government seeking a relaxation in this rule.        
	Analysts like Vaibhav Agrawal of Angel Broking say the move to unlock value in the subsidiaries will have a positive impact on ICICI Banks financials.        
	ICICI Bank has made a lot of investments in these subsidiaries and, therefore, it will have to realise its value at some point of time, said an analyst.        
	ICICI Banks equity investment in the four subsidiaries stood at around Rs 6,000 crore as on June 30, 2009.

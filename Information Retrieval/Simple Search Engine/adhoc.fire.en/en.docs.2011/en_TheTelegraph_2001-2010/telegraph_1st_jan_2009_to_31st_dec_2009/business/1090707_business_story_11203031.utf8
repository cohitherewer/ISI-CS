										      GUEST COLUMN - VENUGPAL DHOOT                        
	On balance, finance minister Pranab Mukherjee has presented a sensible budget. Many may have expected big bang pronouncements based on the Economic Survey 2008-09 that the FM had tabled in Parliament late last week.         
	In the event, Mukherjee has struck a fine balance between the imperatives of his partys mandate for inclusive growth and equitable development, and the short-term needs of the economy poised on the cusp of U-shaped recovery.         
	There is a huge focus in the budget on rural India and rightly so. Agricultural credit stands at Rs 3.25 lakh crore for 2009-10, while an additional Rs1,000 crore has been set aside for irrigation programmes. Agricultural sops  most of which are to be routed through banks, and not the budget like loans to farmers at lesser interest rates and extension of loan waiver period  have also been announced. Given that nearly two-thirds of the population is rural, even a marginal improvement on the rural front will go a long way in boosting rural consumption. This, in turn, is bound to give a leg-up to the economy.        
	Infrastructure, skill development and minority welfare are some of the other areas that have found emphasis in the budget. The Indian Infrastructure Finance Corporation Limited (IIFCL), a dedicated special purpose vehicle for infrastructure projects, is to be given greater flexibility in extending financial assistance to public-private-partnership projects.         
	Budgetary allocation for accelerated power projects programme and the national highways project of the government have been stepped up by 160 per cent and 23 per cent respectively over that for 2008-09.        
	Mukherjee has made clear the governments intention to keep banks and insurance companies in its fold. But he has indicated the governments plans  the task of putting down numbers has been left to the Ministries though  to divest in other public sector enterprises while retaining its total control.         
	The fiscal deficit at 6.8 per cent is an area of concern as no timeline has been specified for a return to the fiscal responsibility and budget management (FRBM) target. So is a lack of policy pronouncements on foreign direct investments. Capital formation has been sluggish in the last 18 months in particular. So explicit pronouncements on FDI would have been welcome. One of the biggest reform measures announced in the budget has been structural changes in the tax system to enhance efficiency in tax administration. The FM has declared the release of a direct tax code draft in the next 45 days for public debate, and the introduction of the goods and services tax (GST) from April 1, 2010. GST is the biggest and long-term reform that has been hanging fire for long. It will put an end to all central and state level indirect taxes such as value added tax, excise duty, service tax, entertainment tax and luxury tax. Introduction of GST should contribute to 1-2 per cent of the GDP. And this in turn could lead to higher revenues for the government. setting up a virtuous cycle.         
	There is a possibility that the roll out of GST may be delayed as its envisaged to be dual in nature, requiring both the central and state governments to legislate and administrate the taxes separately. Mukherjee has set the tone to do away with bad taxes. Fringe benefit tax and commodity transaction tax have been abolished. And so has the surcharge on personal tax, with an assurance to do a similar thing in respect of other surcharges in the future.        
	Though minimum alternate tax has been increased to 15 per cent on book profits, the good news is that there have been no change in corporate tax rates. Also, interim relief has been provided for small, marginal tax payers and senior citizens by raising the income tax limits. All in all, a good budget and I would rate it 7 on a scale of 1 to 10.

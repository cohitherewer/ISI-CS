          OUR BUREAU                              
	Mumbai, Dec. 9: The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) today said it would withdraw from January 1 some concessions on external commercial borrowing (ECB) for Indian firms introduced during the global credit crisis, although it also eased rules for infrastructure and telecom.        
	The changes would limit the ability of firms to borrow funds abroad and then repatriate them, while still encouraging long-term investment needed to overhaul ageing infrastructure and underpin economic growth.        
	In view of the improvement in the credit market conditions and narrowing credit spreads in the international market it has been decided to withdraw the existing relaxation in the all-in-cost ceilings under the approval route, the RBI said in a statement on Wednesday night.        
	A facility for Indian companies to buy back their foreign currency convertible bonds under the automatic route and approval route would be discontinued from January due to the improvement in the equity market.         
	The changes could slow some inflows into the economy, which have supported the rupee this year, but as they only related to local firms they were not expected to unsettle markets greatly.        
	There may be a knee-jerk reaction in the beginning but dont expect too much of a reaction in the market, a foreign exchange analyst said.        
	I expect the rupee to remain stable against the dollar after the initial trades and to trade the way it has traded so far.        
	The central bank said it would allow non-bank financial companies which are focused on financing infrastructure projects to borrow from oversees markets under the approval route.        
	It also extended by a year a rule that allowed firms involved in developing integrated townships to borrow oversees.        
	The central bank allowed telecom firms to access oversees markets to fund their bids for 3G spectrum, effective immediately. India plans to auction 3G spectrum in January.

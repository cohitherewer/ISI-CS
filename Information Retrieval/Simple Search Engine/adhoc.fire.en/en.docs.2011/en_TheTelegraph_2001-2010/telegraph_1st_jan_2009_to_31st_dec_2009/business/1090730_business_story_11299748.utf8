The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Sun Pharma net dips 67%
                                                                                                               Sun Pharma net dips 67%
          OUR BUREAU                                            
	July 29: Sun Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd has reported a 67 per cent drop in consolidated net profit at Rs 163.84 crore for the first quarter ended June 30 against Rs 501.45 crore a year ago.         
	The disappointing result has been attributed to the actions taken by the US Food and Drugs Administration against Sun Pharmas overseas arm Caraco.         
	Total income fell to Rs 787.59 crore from Rs 1,041.77 crore in the year-ago quarter.         
	In June last year, the US drug regulator had said that Caraco was not complying with good manufacturing practices. It later issued a warning letter and then seized drugs from three facilities in Michigan last month. Caraco will not be able to market drugs from these units.         
	Dilip Shanghvi, chairman and managing director of Sun Pharma, said, Performance in the first quarter is overshadowed by the recent developments in our US business. The regulatory setback at Caraco does pose a serious hurdle to our business. While the performance of other businesses is in line with our expectations, our focus is to get back to delivering a consistent overall performance, overcoming the challenges our business face.        
	Hero Honda profit        
	The worlds largest two-wheeler manufacturer Hero Honda has posted an 83 per cent rise in net profit at Rs 500.11 crore for the quarter ended June 30 against Rs 272.87 crore a year earlier.         
	Hero Honda crossed the one-million sales mark for the first time by selling 11,18,987 units and generating a turnover of Rs 3,822.44 crore. This is a rise of 34 per cent over Rs 2,851.04 crore a year earlier.        
	PNB show        
	Punjab National Banks net profit for the April-June quarter rose 62 per cent to Rs 832.05 crore from Rs 512.4 crore a year ago. PNB aims to earn a net profit of about Rs 3,700 crore during this fiscal against Rs 3,091 crore a year ago.         
	We would like to maintain our profit target, which is Rs 3,700 crore for the current fiscal, said M.V. Tanksale, executive director of PNB.

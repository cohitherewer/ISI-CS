	Jangipur, July 12: Finance minister Pranab Mukherjee today said the governments huge borrowing plan would not crowd out corporate houses from the credit market nor would they have to pay a higher interest rates on their loans.        
	I had a meeting with the board of directors of the Reserve Bank yesterday on this, the minister said while inaugurating the State Bank of Indias branch here today.         
	The governments market borrowing last year was well managed by the RBI. The initial target was Rs 1 lakh crore, which went up to Rs 3 lakh crore. But the RBI managed it well. This year, too, they will do it without crowding out corporate borrowers, who will not have to pay higher interest rates because of the government borrowings, he said.        
	However, Mukherjee declined to specify the amount that the government intended to borrow. I wont say this, he said. The details are there in the budget.         
	The bankers expect the huge fiscal deficit to push up interest rates from the third quarter of the current fiscal. A larger market borrowing by the government will also increase the yield on government papers that may inflict losses on banks treasury income.         
	Last year, banks posted good growth in profits on the back of an increase in treasury income, mainly in the second half of 2008-09.        
	The SBI has decided to open 1,000 branches and 10,000 ATMs during the current fiscal. In 2008-09, the bank had opened 807 branches. At present, it has 11,853 branches and 13,983 ATMs.         
	Most of these branches will be opened in rural and semi-urban areas, SBI chairman .P. Bhatt said.

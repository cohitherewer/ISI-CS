	New Delhi, June 5: Mumbai SEZ Ltd could seek an extension of the duration of the in-principle approval that it got from the commerce ministrys Board of Approval, the highest decision making body for SEZs.         
	In August 2008, the BoA had extended the validity of the approval by a year.         
	The Mumbai SEZ promoters can approach the BoA for an extension, which can be considered, said G.K. Pillai, chairman of the BoA and commerce secretary, who became the home secretary later in the day.        
	The BoA gives formal approval to an SEZ only if it has completed the land acquisition and there has not been any compulsory acquisition.        
	The SEZ policy, Pillai said, stated that it was the developer who had to purchase the land from the owners.        
	In June 2007, the Maharashtra government had initiated acquisition under the Land Acquisition Act of 1894.         
	The act stipulates that the acquisition has to be completed within two years. If this is not followed, the entire process is rendered void.        
	Mumbai SEZ promoters had moved the Supreme Court against the state government alleging delay on the part of the land acquisition authority.         
	It said the state government had not proceeded even in those cases where the land-owners had given their consent for the sale.        
	Maharashtra revenue minister Patangrao Kadam today said the state government would not interfere in the acquisition.        
	The land transaction has to be done between the buyer and the seller through mutual understanding. The government will not interfere, the minister said in Mumbai.

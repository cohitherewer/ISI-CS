          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          FUND SEARCH                                  
	Mumbai, April 18: Tech Mahindra has raised Rs 600 crore through the issue of non-convertible debentures (NCDs) to fund the acquisition of Satyam Computer.        
	It allotted 6,000 NCDs of face value of Rs 10 lakh each aggregating Rs 600 crore, the company said in a filing to the Bombay Stock Exchange.        
	The mid-sized outsourcing firm had outbid engineering major Larsen amp; Toubro and US billionaire Wilbur Ross with its offer of Rs 58 a share to gain control of Satyam.         
	According to Tech Mahindra, the instrument has been assigned AAA rating by Credit Analysis and Research Ltd. It is believed that banks and mutual funds have subscribed to the NCD issue.        
	While officials from Tech Mahindra declined to comment, observers feel the company is raising funds to meet the April 21 deadline of depositing Rs 1,756 crore in an escrow account for picking up a controlling stake in the beleaguered IT firm.        
	On depositing the amount, Venturbay  the special purpose vehicle floated for the buyout  will acquire over 30.27 crore shares through a preferential allotment, representing 31 per cent of Satyams equity.         
	The company will also come out with an open offer to acquire another 20 per cent in Satyam for Rs 1,134 crore. The total deal for acquiring a 51 per cent stake in Satyam is around Rs 2,890 crore.        
	Tech Mahindra recently received the approval of the Company Law Board for the acquisition. It will be handed over the ownership of Satyam after it makes the payment for the stake buy.         
	Sources said Tech Mahindra was likely to make the payment on Monday.

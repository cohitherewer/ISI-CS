	Calcutta, June 3: McLeod Russel  the worlds largest bulk tea producer  plans to double output at its overseas subsidiary in Vietnam.        
	It plans to add another 1,000 hectares to the 2,000 hectares it has in the country.        
	The company has requested the local government for land and hopes to get it in the next three to four months, Aditya Khaitan, managing director of McLeod Russel, said.         
	Since the prices have started firming up in India, tea gardens would be more expensive. We think there would be more opportunity abroad in terms of low cost base, he said after announcing the companys results for 2008-09.        
	McLeod has posted a consolidated net profit of Rs 83.47 crore, up 79.85 per cent from Rs 46.41 crore in 2007-08.        
	The board of directors of the company has proposed a dividend of Rs 2 apiece on equity shares of Rs 5 each.

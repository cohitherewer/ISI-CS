	 Calcutta, July 12: Cross-holding among group companies of the Rs 10,000-crore BK Birla group will not be a problem for the succession plan approved by the family, group chairman B.K. Birla said. Stock exchange data show that some companies such as Mangalam Cement and Mangalam Timber, which will go to different heirs, have quite high cross-holdings.                            
	 New Delhi, July 12: Planning Commission deputy chairman Montek Singh Ahluwalia today endorsed the high fiscal deficit of 6.8 per cent as projected in the budget, saying that increased government expenditure will stimulate economic growth. The government has projected a high fiscal deficit, triggering alarm bells among investors and industry.                            
	 New Delhi, July 12: The fertiliser ministry may come up with guidelines for the new subsidy policy in the next two months. The subsidy is likely to be fixed by the government in advance, throwing fertiliser prices open to change in sync with market realities.                             
	 New Delhi, July 12: Sebi today said it would not intervene to check stock price movement amid sharp volatility unless there was a system collapse, as volatility in the market was a reality. Sebi chairman C.B. Bhave said markets and regulators had handled the global crisis well, advocating a free-flowing mechanism.                             
	 Mumbai, July 12: The government has been making periodic changes in the prices of petrol and diesel depending upon global rates, which is effectively as good as deregulation, petroleum minister Murli Deora said. However, he added that deregulation of petroleum products used by the poorer section of society needs to have a human face.                            
	 New Delhi, July 12: Sebi will seek more information from Bharti Airtel on its proposed $23-billion deal with South African firm MTN once there is more clarity on it.

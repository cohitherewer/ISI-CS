The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Anil seeks expert probe 
                                                                                                               Anil seeks expert probe

	Aug. 25: Anil Ambani wants the government to appoint an independent, international expert to certify Reliance Industries Rs 45,000-crore capital expenditure on the KG-D6 gasfield which, he believes, has been inflated.        
	In a letter to petroleum secretary R.S. Pandey, the Anil Dhirubhai Ambani Group (ADAG) wants the petroleum ministry to seek the help of a reputed international expert with experience in deep-water blocks to revalidate the KG-D6 expenditure. Anil has accused RIL of gold-plating costs  artificially inflating expenditure to justify high exploration costs  to extract super profits from the gasfield.         
	Under the terms of the production-sharing contract, RIL is entitled to recover costs fully before it shares revenues with the government. The group has requested the petroleum ministry to ensure the expeditious completion of the Comptroller and Auditor General audit on RILs capital expenditure and disclose the finding and identity of the auditors involved in the exercise.         
	The letter also criticises RIL for not offering enough evidence to justify how the capital expenditure has gone up to Rs 45,000 crore from Rs 12,000 crore when the production in the block only doubled to 80 mcmd from 40 mcmd.         
	The ADAG camp has asked the petroleum ministry for an independent probe into the KG-D6 capex as a reaction to RILs letter to the same ministry explaining the rise in capex at this block.         
	The (media) reports suggest that the (RIL) letter also dismisses the growing and well-argued opposition to this totally unjustified increase by attributing it to self-seeking vested interests who are ostensibly out to malign the KG-D6 project, says the letter written by ADAG group president A.N. Sethuraman.        
	It says experts, including a committee of secretaries, cabinet secretary K.M. Chandrasekhar, and C. Rangarajan, chairman of the Prime Ministers economic advisory council, have raised questions about the gasfield cost.

                                                                                                               Court grants bail to Raju aide
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Whiff of relief                                  
	Hyderabad, Feb. 6: An Andhra Pradesh court today granted bail to D. Gopalakrishna Raju, the general manager of SRSR Advisory Services, a company through which the promoters controlled Satyam. This is the first instance of an accomplice of disgraced Satyam founder B. Ramalinga Raju getting relief.        
	The sixth additional chief metropolitan magistrate directed Raju not to leave Hyderabad and to be available for interrogation.        
	Raju and three others of SRSR Advisory Services were arrested last week by the Andhra Pradesh CID during a series of raids on the various premises of Ramalinga Raju, which unearthed documents on the Satyam founders benami land deals.        
	In another order, the court extended the police custody of the Price Waterhouse auditors, S. Gopalakrishna and Srinivas Talluri, by one more day. The judicial custody of Ramalinga Raju, his brother Rama Raju and Satyam CFO Srinivas Vadlamani will come up for review on Monday.        
	Sebi today concluded its interrogation of the trio. A spokesperson for the regulator said they had conclusive proof of the heavy insider trading resorted to by the Raju family and several Satyam employees.

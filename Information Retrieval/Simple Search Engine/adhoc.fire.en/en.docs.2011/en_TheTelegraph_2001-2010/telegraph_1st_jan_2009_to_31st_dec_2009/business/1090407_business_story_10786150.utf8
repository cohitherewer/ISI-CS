                                                                                                               Danone calls it quits at Britannia
          OUR BUREAU                                            
	April 6: After an uneasy relationship spanning several years, Groupe Danone and the Wadias have finally decided to part ways. The French food major will exit Britannia Industries Ltd (BIL) by selling its indirect stake of 25.48 per cent to a Wadia group company.        
	In a notice issued to the stock exchanges, Leila Lands, a 100 per cent subsidiary of Bombay Burmah (a Wadia company), has proposed to acquire 100 per cent in Britannia Brands Limited, which holds an indirect stake of 25.48 per cent in BIL, from Danone Asia Pte Ltd.        
	As a result, Leila Lands stake in BIL will increase to 50.96 per cent from 25.48 per cent.        
	According to the notice, the date for the proposed acquisition is April 14.         
	A BIL spokesperson said the company would not comment on the transaction before April 14.         
	The price at which the transaction has been agreed upon is not known.         
	The notice, however, states that the inter se transfer price shall not exceed 25 per cent of the price fixed by the takeover regulations.         
	The Britannia stock closed at Rs 1,468.05 on the Bombay Stock Exchange, up Rs 41.80, or 2.93 per cent, from yesterdays close.         
	Considering Britannias closing price on the stock exchanges today, the value of Danones stake in the biscuit firm will be around Rs 893 crore.         
	Singapores Danone Asia Pte Ltd, owned by Groupe Danone, holds 100 per cent in Britannia Brands Limited, UK.        
	Danone and Wadias hold equal stake in BIL through their joint ownership of Associated Biscuits International Holdings, UK, which is a 50 per cent subsidiary of Britannia Brands.        
	Hence, the acquisition of Britannia Brands will give Leila Lands an additional indirect holding of 60.86 lakh equity shares, or a 25.48 per cent stake.        
	As a result of the transfer of shares between the promoters  the Wadias and Danone  the former will once again have complete control of Britannia Ltd.        
	Danone, on its part, will be free to pursue its independent plans in India.         
	The French company is a leading producer of dairy products and bottled water with brands such as Evian.        
	Experts believe the deal will put an end to the soured relationship between the promoters.         
	Trouble started between the two over the intellectual property rights of the Tiger brand of biscuits.        
	In 2007, the Wadias dragged Danone to court contesting the French giants unauthorised use of its Tiger biscuit brand in certain countries.        
	Britannia has always maintained that the Tiger brand was created, developed and launched in India.         
	It alleged that Danone had registered the brand as its own in many countries without informing its joint venture partner. The Wadias came to know of it when Britannia faced problems while exporting Tiger biscuits.        
	The two were locked in a fight yet again over investment in life science company Avesthagen.         
	The Wadias had gone to court over the acquisition of a 5 per cent stake by Danone in Bangalore-based Avesthagen, terming it a violation of the joint venture agreement that the latter had signed in the early 1990s.

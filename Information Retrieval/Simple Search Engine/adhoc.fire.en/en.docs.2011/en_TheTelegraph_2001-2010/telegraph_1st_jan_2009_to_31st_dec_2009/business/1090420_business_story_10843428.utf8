        Vikas Vasal offers investment advice in these troubled times                                          
	The financial world has changed in the last six months. Companies are in trouble, governments are trying to find a way through the maze, and individuals are clueless about their investment strategies.         
	Investors are at a loss while picking financial instruments for long-term savings and investment.        
	Here we will lay down the fundamentals of investment first:          Do not put all your eggs in one basket  irrespective of the return being offered by any asset class, diversify your investments, to distribute your risk.  Each individual is unique. A particular investment strategy which works for one person may not apply to another person.   Regular systematic investment and discipline is necessary. The age-old principle of save and then spend still holds true.  Change with age: Tweak your investment strategy according to your risk appetite and financial requirements.    
	Let us now consider a few of the important investment avenues for an investor.        
	Equity markets        
	An individual may invest in equities directly or through mutual funds.         
	Generally, one may expect a return of 15-20 per cent from equity investments in the long term.         
	You should have a good understanding of the equity markets, the sector and the companies in which you want to invest.         
	Many individuals may not have the time and resources to do an in-depth research and hence may rely on mutual funds to decide for them.         
	Regular investments could be done by taking a Systematic Investment Plan (SIP) of a mutual fund scheme. You can go for equity, debt or balance schemes.        
	Provident Fund and Public Provident Fund        
	For people working in the organised sector, PF is an excellent tool for long-term savings and investments. For others, there is PPF, where one can open an account with a bank or post office and make regular contributions.        
	The good thing about PF and PPF is that these are long term investments and there are restrictions on withdrawal of funds before specified period. Besides, they are backed by the government and offer a decent return of 8 per cent or more.        
	Life insurance        
	Consider taking a life risk cover early in life. For every lakh of pure life insurance cover one needs to pay only few hundred rupees as premium. Opting for a pure risk plan is a good option at a young age when the income levels are low. But remember, insurance is not an investment tool, rather an assurance to help your family meet its financial obligations in case of any mishap.        
	Real estate        
	If owning a house is your dream, buy one at the earliest so that you can repay the loan with progressive increase in income levels.        
	Under the income tax act, you can get deductions on interest paid on housing loans. In case of a self occupied house, an interest deduction of up to Rs 150,000 can be claimed, while in case of a let-out property, the actual interest deduction can be claimed.         
	One can also consider investing in other residential or commercial property and earn rental income or gain from capital appreciation in future. It is generally observed that commercial properties offer a rental return of around 10 per cent, while residential ones offer lower rental yield on the market value of the property.         
	However, location and other market factors determine rental yield.        
	While taking housing loans, one must bear in mind the EMIs and the interest one has to pay from regular monthly income and ensure that the current lifestyle is not affected because of the EMIs.        
	Bank fixed deposits        
	Bank FDs may not offer a high rate of return, but they still offer security of capital and decent returns. Also, they can be encashed at a short notice. Keeping in view uncertainties of job and businesses these days one should keep a certain portion of money, say equivalent to three to six months income, in FDs to meet any short-term need.         
	The interest rates on deposits vary from time to time. Till some time back banks were offering up to 10 per cent on long term deposits. But now one can expect around 6-8 per cent on term deposits.        
	Gold        
	Gold offers a good opportunity to diversify. Investment in gold can be either in the physical form, which includes gold coins and jewellery or through exchange traded funds (ETFs).         
	ETF scores over physical form of gold in terms of liquidity, safety and taxation. Gold has given a return of 10 per cent on a long term basis.        
	New pension schemes         
	Till now, only government employees were covered by the New Pension Schemes (NPS). However, this investment avenue is being opened up for non-government employees as well.         
	So far pension funds have earned 10-16 per cent returns. Therefore, NPS offers a good investment avenue from the long term perspective.         
	The investment style and strategy should change with age as well. When one is young, one may like to invest in more riskier investment options for a higher rate of return, while as one progresses in life especially towards the retirement, then the return of capital gains importance over returns on capital.         
	For someone who is less than 35, a 60-80 per cent of the investment kitty can be put in equity and real estate, while the rest could go to life insurance, provident fund, gold, etc.        
	As one moves towards middle age, say 35-55 years, one may restrict his investment in real estate and equity to 40-60 per cent.        
	Close to retirement, say above 55 years, the exposure in equity may be minimised while a majority of the investments could be in fixed deposits or debt instruments offering safety of capital, ease of liquidity and a decent return.        
	So, go ahead and make your investment strategy even during the slowdown!

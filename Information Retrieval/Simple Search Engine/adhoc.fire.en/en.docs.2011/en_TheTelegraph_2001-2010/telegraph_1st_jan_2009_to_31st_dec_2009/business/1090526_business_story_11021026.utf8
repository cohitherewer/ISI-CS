The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Bharti redials MTN number
                                                                                                               Bharti redials MTN number
          OUR BUREAU      
	Mumbai/New Delhi, May 25: Exactly a year after talks on an alliance floundered, Bharti Airtel and MTN of South Africa have re-opened negotiations to create a $20bn telecom behemoth with over 200 million customers.        
	If the transaction is completed, this will be the largest cross-border deal by an Indian company, topping the $12bn Tata-Corus deal in 2007.        
	It will also rank among the top mergers and acquisition (M amp;A) deals in the world this year after the Merck takeover of Schering Plough for $45.9 billion and the $14.2 billion buyout of Spains Endesa by Enel SpA of Italy.        
	We see real power in this combination and we will work hard to unleash it for all our shareholders, said Sunil Bharti Mittal, chairman and managing director of Bharti.         
	The strategic alliance forms the first leg of the transaction and is expected to lead to a full merger of MTN and Bharti Airtel.         
	Bharti and MTN have agreed to discuss the first leg of this transaction exclusively with one another until July 31. Until then, there is no possibility of a rival bidder emerging on the scene.        
	Last May, talks between Bharti Airtel and MTN broke down after the South African entity  which has larger revenues and profits than the Indian company  refused to become a Bharti subsidiary.        
	Soon after, MTN opened talks with Anil Ambani-owned Reliance Communications which also came unstuck after Mukesh Ambani-run Reliance Industries threatened to invoke a right of first refusal on any stake sale under the terms of the demerger agreement between the two Ambani scions.        
	The complex transaction proposes that Bharti will acquire a 49 per cent shareholding in MTN.         
	In turn, the South African firm will acquire a 25 per cent stake in Bharti, while its key shareholders will pick up another 11 per cent.         
	Even though the complex structure of the transaction may result in cross-holdings, stock market analysts believe that Bharti will be in the drivers seat though the companies will continue to operate as separate entities.         
	A press release issued by MTN said the South African company would also have certain rights to increase its economic interest in Bharti in the future. Bharti was silent on this claim.        
	The rationale for this potential transaction between MTN and Bharti is highly compelling. It addresses our strategic imperative of becoming one of the pre-eminent emerging markets telecommunications companies with leading positions in three of the fastest growing wireless markets globallyIndia, Africa and West Asia, with no overlapping footprint, said Phuthuma Nhleko, CEO of MTN.        
	For Bharti, the reasons are clear. The company will succeed in future proofing its growth in the coming years and find an appropriate investment avenue for its free cash if this transaction is completed, said telecom analysts.         
	The cash component of the deal can be estimated. While MTN will pay Bharti $2.9 billion, Bharti may end up paying a 30 per cent premium to MTN shareholders at current market prices, which is not much. So, Bharti may end up paying roughly $7 billion in cash at current price estimates, said Shobit Khare, vice-president (research) of Motilal Oswal.         
	Bharti said the deal might be EPS dilutive in the first year. Analysts, however, are unperturbed by this.         
	However, there are some questions on certain aspects of the deal. Some analysts wondered whether MTNs acquisition of a 25 per cent stake in Bharti would trigger Sebis takeover code which would make an open offer to the public mandatory.        
	There are also some grey areas on the actual synergies that will emanate from a deal of this type, said Khare.         
	MTN today stated that there would not be any job losses in South Africa pursuant to its transaction with Bharti.        
	The implementation of the potential transaction would not result in any job losses in South Africa, quot; MTN said in a statement.        
	The South African telecom major further said, MTN would continue to be listed on the (Johannesburg) Securities Exchange operated by JSE Ltd.        
	The Bharti scrip today fell Rs 46.45, or 5.41 per cent, to end at Rs 811.40 on the Bombay Stock Exchange today.                    
	Vodafone trigger         
	Vodafone  the worlds largest telecom company  has been making aggressive moves into Africa, and this is one of the biggest factors that has brought MTN back into negotiations with Sunil Mittal-owned Bharti Airtel.        
	Last November, Vodafone raised its stake in Vodacom  MTNs competitor in South Africa  to 65 per cent.         
	The British giant had bought an additional 15 per cent stake from Telkom South Africa for $2.66 billion, which effectively ended a 50-50 partnership. Telkom South Africas remaining stake was sold to investors.         
	It is now aiming to use Vodacom to snap up small telecom entities across Africa as the valuations of target firms have fallen in the past year.        
	Africa is one of the few regions in the world where there is still scope for telecom buyouts.        
	Like MTN, Bharti Airtel is a key rival of Vodafone in India and has been successful in staying a couple of steps ahead of the giant.         
	On May 15, Bharti said its subscriber base had crossed 100 million, double the number of subscribers its had in October 2007.        
	Until a full merger is effected, MTN will be looking to harness some of those strategies to stay ahead of the game in South Africa and other African markets where it is a strong player.

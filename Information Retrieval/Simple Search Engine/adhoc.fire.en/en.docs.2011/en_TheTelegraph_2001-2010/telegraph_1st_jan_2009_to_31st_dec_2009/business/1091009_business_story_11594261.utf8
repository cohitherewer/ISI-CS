	 Mumbai, Oct. 8: ICICI Bank today cut interest rates on auto loans by 50 basis points to 10.75 per cent with immediate effect. The rate cut is a part of the banks festive offer. This may prompt competitors to lower their lending rates in the near term. The reduction comes a few weeks before the Reserve Banks announcement of the half-yearly review of its monetary policy.

The 13-basis point slide in inflation over 0.83 per cent in the previous week was on account of a slight easing of prices of certain items such as poultry chicken, bajra, fruits, arhar and spices. The wholesale price index was 12.08 per cent in the corresponding week a year ago.

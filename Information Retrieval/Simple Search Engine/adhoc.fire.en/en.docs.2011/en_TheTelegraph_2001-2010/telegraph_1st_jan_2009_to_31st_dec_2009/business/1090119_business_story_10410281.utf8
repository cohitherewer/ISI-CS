          R. SURYAMURTHY                          Balancing act                                  
	New Delhi, Jan. 18: Any free pricing regime in fuel will have sufficient safeguards to protect consumers from market swings.        
	With crude prices falling sharply, the government is planning a move to a deregulated environment with strings attached.        
	The deregulation of fuel would not be a complete free market play. There would be checks and balances for the government to intervene and prevent too much volatility in retail prices, a petroleum ministry official said.        
	According to the officials, the prices of petrol and diesel will be deregulated, but the government will continue to subsidise domestic LPG cylinder and kerosene.        
	Jet fuel prices will be revised on a fortnightly basis.        
	The government will fix an upper price band for imported crude. If the global price moves beyond the band, the government can intervene to lessen the burden on consumers.        
	The ministry is yet to decide on whether the intervention will be in the form of a fiscal measure or a subsidy-sharing mechanism.        
	A strategy to subsidise cooking gas and kerosene is being discussed. An official said duties on fuel would be levied in such a way that they would increase with a fall in global crude prices and vice versa.        
	At present, the government collects an excise duty of Rs 13.35 per litre on unbranded petrol and Rs 3.65 per litre on unbranded diesel. The revenue generated from the increased excise duty will be used to subsidise kerosene and domestic LPG.         
	Taxes imposed by the states on petrol and diesel may not change.        
	According P. Raghavendran, president of Reliance Industries refinery business, The government must come out with a policy for the removal of government control on pricing and uniform application of fiscal interventions to moderate prices so that there was greater predictability of margins and cash flow was not affected.

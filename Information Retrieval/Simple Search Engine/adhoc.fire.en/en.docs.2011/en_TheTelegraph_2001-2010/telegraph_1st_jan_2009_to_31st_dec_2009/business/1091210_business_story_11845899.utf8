	New Delhi, Dec. 9: Bajaj Auto today said it would exit scooters by the end of this fiscal and focus on motorcycles.        
	At present, the company sells only the 100-cc gearless Crystal.         
	We will exit the scooter market because we dont see much sense in it. If we are to be a motorcycle specialist, we cannot make scooters, managing director Rajiv Bajaj said. The company today launched the 135cc Pulsar, priced at Rs 51,000 (ex-showroom, Delhi).        
	The scooters did not sell according to our expectations. We are making hardly 1,000 scooters a month and mostly for exports. Our focus is on motorcycles, he said, adding that the company wanted to become the largest bike player in the world, without giving any specific time frame.        
	According to the Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers, Bajaj sold just 154 units of the Crystal in November and exported 104 units.        
	Cumulative domestic scooter sales during April-November period were 3,356 units, while overseas sales stood at 728 units.         
	Bajaj said it had an annual production capacity of three million bikes. In the 30-million global bikes market, the largest bike maker Honda sells 7 million units. We can make 3 million units. We can double it and triple it, he said.        
	The company is developing high-end versions of the Pulsar. We can go for a Pulsar 400cc or a Pulsar 500cc. We are already in the process of developing such bikes and our R amp;D teams are at work, he said.        
	Its Pulsar portfolio includes the 150cc, 180cc and 220cc variants.        
	The company has also decided to phase out the Exceed and has already stopped its production.         
	Bajaj said he was looking at sales of 1.8 million units this fiscal against 1.2 million units last year.

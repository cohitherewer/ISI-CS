The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Labour pill to perk up pension
                                                                                                               Labour pill to perk up pension
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                          FUND BALANCE                                  
	New Delhi, Feb. 20: The standing committee on labour has said that the governments contribution to the employees pension scheme be increased to at least 4 per cent of a workers salary.         
	At present, the Centre contributes 1.16 per cent.        
	The contribution of the government should be fixed at least at half of the rate of contribution made by the employer or the employee towards the pension scheme, said S.S. Reddy, chairman of the standing committee on labour.         
	Pensions are entirely funded from an employers contribution to a workers provident fund and a central government subsidy.         
	A provident fund of an employee is 24 per cent of the salary, with the employer and employee contributing 12 per cent each.        
	From the employers share, 8.33 per cent of the salary go to pensions, while the government contributes 1.16 per cent.         
	A periodic revision of the contributions was suggested by the panel in its report tabled in the Lok Sabha today. The scheme was last revised eight years ago.         
	The non-revision in the rates of contributions even after one-and-a-half decades speaks volumes about the callous attitude of the government towards the workforce, said Reddy.         
	The employees pension scheme was launched in 1995.         
	A trade union leader was quoted in the report as saying that the governments contribution had remained the same for a long period, while the employers and employees share had increased.        
	In its recommendations, the committee said that the government should shed its lackadaisical approach towards the welfare of the workers.         
	It should take positive steps towards linking the pension scheme with the price index and fix a reasonable amount as the minimum pension.        
	Besides, the government was asked to revise the monthly wage ceiling.         
	The present ceiling of Rs 6,500 has lost its relevance after substantial increases in wages, the panel said.         
	It recommended the ceiling be raised to Rs 15,000, immediately.         
	On the Employees Provident Fund Organisation, the committee asked the government to develop a database of existing and new members and consider issuing smart cards.        
	Only 4.44 crore of Indias 43 crore workers are covered under the provident fund and pension schemes.         
	The panel suggested that all workers, irrespective of their industry, should be brought within the purview of the schemes.         
	It also suggested a division to handle pensioners grievances.        
	Pensions under the scheme were extremely insignificant. In a large number of cases they were below Rs 100, the report said.

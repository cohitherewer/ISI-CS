The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Govt vows to protect local auto parts
                                                                                                               Govt vows to protect local auto parts
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                          Duty call                                  
	New Delhi, May 5: The government may either impose safeguard duties or initiate anti-dumping steps to protect the domestic industry from cheap imports of auto components.        
	If it is required if it is hurting, we will impose an anti-dumping duty, Surajit Mitra, additional secretary in the department of heavy industries, told reporters after a seminar organised by Ficci.        
	Industry is worried about cheap auto components such as gearboxes, shock absorbers, front axle beams and steering knuckles from China affecting domestic business. Auto component makers had earlier approached the government for protective measures.         
	The government is reviewing data and will consider either safeguard duties or anti-dumping measures in the long-run.        
	As a nation, we are ready to take action, initially safeguards and then anti-dumping. We are waiting for data from the industry, said Mitra, adding that the measures would be in compliance with World Trade Organisation (WTO) norms.        
	According to WTO rules, the government has the right to impose duties and regulations if there is a surge in cheap imports, Mitra said.         
	Sources said India was considering anti- dumping duties on the imports of front axle beams and steering knuckles used in commercial vehicles. The provisional anti-dumping duty could range between $0.50 per kg and $0.69 per kg.        
	Car prices        
	The government is concerned about car makers raising prices despite the various stimulus packages offered to the industry.         
	It (price hike) is a matter of concern as demand is falling and the government also gave incentives to the car makers by cutting excise duty, but they hiked prices after that, said Mitra.        
	Commodity prices, specially steel, have come down after the government handed out tax concessions.        
	We do not do the micro-management of price control. It is up to the car makers. But wherever there is any tax-payers money involved we will monitor that, he said.

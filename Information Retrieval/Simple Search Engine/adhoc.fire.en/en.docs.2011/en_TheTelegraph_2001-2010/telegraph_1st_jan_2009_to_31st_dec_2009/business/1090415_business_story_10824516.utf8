The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Asarco takeover tussle intensifies
                                                                                                               Asarco takeover tussle intensifies
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                            
	Calcutta, April 14: The battle between Indias Sterlite Industries and Mexicos Grupo Mexico for the control of United States bankrupt copper major Asarco LLC has taken a new turn.        
	Grupo Mexico today re-entered the ring with a higher cash offer for Asarco, stumping Sterlite just as it did last year.        
	The company told the US bankruptcy court at Corpus Christi, Texas that it was ready to offer $1.3 billion in cash for Asarco.        
	Sterlite had offered $1.1 billion in cash and $600 million in promissory notes spread over nine years. It had signed a definitive agreement with the Asarco management last month.        
	The deal was subject to the approval of the bankruptcy court judge.        
	Last year, a similar drama was played out in the courts.        
	Sterlite, which is owned by London Stock Exchange listed Vedanta Resources Plc, had turned out to be the highest bidder for Asarco, offering $2.6 billion on May 30, 2008.        
	But within days, Grupo, which used to be the owner of Asarco before the US company became bankrupt in 2005, came up with a higher offer of $4.2 billion.        
	Soon after, copper prices tumbled as the credit crunch pushed the global economy into recession mode. Sterlite walked out of the deal in October 2008, only to come back with a 34 per cent lower offer last month.         
	Sterlite officials today declined to comment on the development saying it was premature to say anything.        
	We do not know what exactly is the offer from Grupo, an official said.        
	However, industry observers feel Sterlites offer cannot be the last one.        
	When a counter-bid is expected, none offers the most it can in the first round. We expect Sterlite to come back with a better offer, they said.        
	One of the options before Sterlite could be to increase the cash component of its offer.        
	Grupo claimed that it had the backing of those who were pursuing environmental claims against Asarco. Grupo plans to pay $500 million in cash and another $250 million in notes to settle claims of asbestos injuries.        
	Sterlite, however, had the support of the company union and some other creditors, which included the US government.        
	Incidentally, the latest move by Grupo Mexico came less than two weeks after another US court in Brownsville, Texas, ordered a unit of the Mexican mining conglomerate to return to Asarco 30 per cent of the shares of New York Stock Exchange-listed Southern Copper Co.         
	The order stemmed from a ruling last year that Grupo Mexico had defrauded Asarco creditors when it transferred Asarcos stake in the then-named Southern Peru Copper Co to one of its own subsidiaries in 2004.        
	Based on recent share prices of the Peruvian unit, monetary damages in the case could exceed $6 billion.         
	Grupo Mexico has said it intends to appeal the judgment.        
	If Grupo Mexico returned the 30 per cent stake plus the dividends it owes Asarco would hold as much as $9 billion in assets. It could use that sum to pay off creditors and emerge from bankruptcy.        
	Asarco, formerly known as American Smelting and Refining Company, is a 110-year-old company and currently the third largest copper producer in the US.         
	It sold approximately 237,000 tonnes of refined copper in 2008.         
	Asarcos mines currently have estimated reserves of 5 million tonnes of contained copper.         
	During the year ended 31 December 2008, Asarco had revenues of nearly $1.9 billion and profit before tax of $393 million.

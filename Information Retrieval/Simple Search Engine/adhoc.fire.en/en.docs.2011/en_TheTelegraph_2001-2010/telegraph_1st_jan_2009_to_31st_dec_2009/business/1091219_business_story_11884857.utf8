          OUR CORRESPONDENT                                          
	New Delhi, Dec. 18: The government expects economic growth for the year to exceed 7.75 per cent, encouraged by a 7.9 per cent rise in the second quarter.        
	With growth in the latest gross domestic product data for the second quarter (July-September) of 2009-10 being higher at 7.9 per cent, the growth outlook for the next two quarters and for the whole year is likely to be in the upper bound of the range predicted, and may even exceed it, the finance ministry said in its mid-year review of the economy for this fiscal, which was tabled in Parliament today.        
	The latest Economic Survey 2008-09 had indicated that the growth in real GDP this financial year could be around 7-7.5 per cent.        
	The mid-year review also stressed on urgent action to contain the rising prices of food articles. The rise in the prices of primary articles of consumption in the recent times is indeed a cause of concern, and this needs to be attended to on an urgent basis, said the report.        
	Finance minister Pranab Mukherjee said in a written reply to the Rajya Sabha today that the government is monitoring the price situation on a regular basis and containing inflation is high on its agenda.         
	Attributing high inflation to supply problems, the review said increased purchasing power and poverty alleviation programmes have raised the demand for various goods.        
	However, food production has been affected because of drought and poor rain.        
	To cushion the impact of deficient rain, the government has raised the minimum support prices of some pulses and offered a bonus on the support price of paddy. Minimum support price is the rate at which the government buys from farmers.        
	High support prices are helping to drive inflation up, prompting the central bank to signal a reversal of its easy stand in its October monetary policy review meeting.        
	The Reserve Bank of Indias (fiscal) second-quarter review of its monetary policy expressed the dilemma of inflationary concerns, calling for an early exit from the accommodative monetary policy as contrasted with growth drivers warranting a delay in such exit, the report said.         
	The timing and pace of exiting the fiscal stimulus will (however) hinge on the strength of recovery.        
	The report also stated that the government needs to focus on expenditure reforms to cut its high fiscal deficit. Stating that fiscal deficit at 6.8 per cent in the current fiscal year is not sustainable on a long-term basis, the report emphasised on the need for fiscal consolidation in the medium term.

                                                                                                               State Bank backs govt view on interest rates
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                          Bhatt: Stable trend                                  
	New Delhi, Sept. 25: The State Bank of India does not expect interest rates to go up in the near future, in sync with the governments stand of continuing with a low-interest rate regime till the signs of global economic recovery become stronger.        
	Borrowing rates are not likely to see any upward trend in the near future, said .P. Bhatt, chairman of the SBI.         
	While most PSU banks lend at 11.75-12.25 per cent, with Delhi-based Punjab National Bank offering the lowest prime lending rate of 11 per cent, private banks such as ICICI Bank, HDFC Bank and Axis Bank lend at12.75-16 per cent.        
	Earlier this week, finance minister Pranab Mukherjee had said he was against a tight money policy. We are not prescribing the introduction of a tight money policy at this juncture till the global economy, especially the European and the US economies, shows sufficient signs of recovery, the minister had said         
	Reserve Bank of India governor D. Subbarao recently said the central bank would not reverse its soft money policy unless it was sure about the economic recovery.         
	 Since October 2008, the RBI has reduced the repo rate  the rate at which banks borrow from the RBI  by 425 basis points to 4.75 per cent, while the reverse repo has been lowered by 275 basis points to 3.25 per cent. Reverse repo is the rate at which the RBI absorbs excess cash from the banking system.        
	The cash reserve ratio  the percentage of deposits that banks have to maintain with the RBI  has been cut by 400 basis points to 5 per cent to inject Rs 1,60,000 crore into the system.        
	The RBI, which has considerably eased the monetary policy to provide liquidity to crisis-hit industry, is slated to announce the second quarter review of its monetary policy on October 27.        
	On slashing interest rates on auto loans, Bhatt said the bank was lending at the lowest rates in the industry and another round of cuts was not on the cards.        
	The SBI offers car and home loans at 8 per cent for the first year. Few private lenders have recently slashed rates on auto loans, increasing competition in the market.

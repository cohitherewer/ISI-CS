The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Inflation fall fails to cheer
                                                                                                               Inflation fall fails to cheer
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                            
	New Delhi, April 16: Inflation fell to a two-decade low of 0.18 per cent for the week ended April 4, but food prices have risen, giving the BJP an opportunity to attack the Congress.        
	During the week under review, vegetables, liquor, tea and coffee, pulses and cereals turned dearer.         
	The decline in inflation was mainly because of a higher base effect and falling prices of some manufactured products such as metals. As prices were rising sharply last year, the high base effect makes the current increase in the price index appear small.         
	Inflation stood at 7.71 per cent in the year-ago week.        
	What makes this set of wholesale price figures redundant for the common man is that besides the high food prices, the consumer price index rose 9.63 per cent in February. It remains far higher than the wholesale market prices, said D. Joshi, principal economist with Crisil.         
	BJPs Arun Jaitley said: Manmohan Singh, P. Chidambaram and Montek Singh Ahluwalia were together described as a dream team. But only a sham dream team can deliver high prices in a recessionary environment.        
	Businesses, however, are upbeat  falling inflation not only means cheaper raw materials but also raises the possibility of a cut in the RBIs key policy rates.

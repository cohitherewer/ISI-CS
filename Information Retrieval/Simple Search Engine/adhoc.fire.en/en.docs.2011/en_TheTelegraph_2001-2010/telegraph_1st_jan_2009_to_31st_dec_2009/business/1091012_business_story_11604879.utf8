                                I am more than 70-years-old and a PAN card holder. I used to submit my income tax return regularly till assessment year 2006-07. My total annual income is less than Rs 1.25 lakh. After submitting my last return in 2006-07, I appealed to the concerned joint/additional commissioner of income tax to exempt me from submitting return any more considering my gross annual income. Without having received any response from the department, I stopped filing my IT returns from financial year 2006-07. Am I right in doing so?           Barin Kumar Dutta, Kalyani
                      Filing of income tax return is mandatory for those who either have an annual income in excess of the basic exemption limit or claimed tax refund. IT return filing is optional for individuals who have income less than the basic exemption limit.                                       Free from tax      I am an unemployed woman. I would like to know that if I earn capital gain from shares within 12 months of their purchase, would I have to pay capital gains tax, though my annual income is well below the threshold limit? If I invest the capital gain to purchase shares within 3-4 months of selling, will I have to pay tax?        Lekha Boliar, Baruipur
                    You dont have to pay income tax if your total annual income, including the capital gain, is below the basic exemption limit. If you dont have any taxable income, you dont have to file a return.                      More channels required      I want to know whether the benefits of the New Pension Scheme are available in rural areas or not. There are no points of presence (POP) for the scheme in rural areas?         Swapan Kumar Mondal, Howrah
                    The NPS is rolled out for all citizens of the country. However, currently there are 731 points of sales for this scheme. POPs collect the subscription amount and transfer it electronically to the custodian bank. But banks and post offices in the rural areas are not yet fully computerised. The pension fund regulator is, however, aware of this problem and is working out on alternative channels.

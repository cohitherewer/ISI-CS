The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Stimulus exit in phases
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Stimulus exit in phases
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                                    
	New Delhi, Dec. 5: Reserve Bank deputy governor Subir Gokarn today said the central bank would wind down the easy money policy in phases.        
	A surprise 7.9 per cent growth in the second quarter is a new element but not the only factor in determining the monetary policy, he said.        
	However, a beginning (reversing the easy money policy) was made in October when the RBI restored the statutory liquidity ratio (SLR) to 25 per cent from 24 per cent. Going forward, it has to be a graded process of exit. All options are open before the RBI, Gokarn said while speaking on the sidelines of the ICC Regional CEO Forum.        
	During the mid-term review of the monetary policy on October 27, the RBI had raised the SLR to 25 per cent, hinting that it would like to exit the loose monetary policy.        
	With food price inflation hovering around the 17-per-cent-mark, Gokarn said inflationary expectations could build up in the economy.        
	Gokarn agreed that the RBIs focus had now shifted from just promoting economic growth to striking a balance between economic expansion and curbing inflation.

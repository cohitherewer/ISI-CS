   Winner outlines funding plan          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Anand Mahindra in Mumbai on Monday. (AP)                                        
	Mumbai, April 13: Tech Mahindra will use a mix of debt and own resources to fund the Satyam deal, ruling out the possibility of inviting another investor for a joint bid.        
	The company today emerged as the winner in the race for Satyam Computer, offering Rs 58 per share for a 51 per cent stake aggregating Rs 2,890 crore.        
	Bharat Doshi, CFO of Mahindra amp; Mahindra, said Tech Mahindra has Rs 700 crore of cash through internal generation.         
	It also has the ability to raise debt either through Tech Mahindra or through the special purpose vehicle (Venture Bay Consultants) floated to acquire a 51 per cent stake in Satyam, he added.         
	Doshis statement indicates that the Mahindra company will raise Rs 2,190 crore to finance the transaction. He said there was no need to leverage Satyams balance sheet to raise debt.         
	Kotak Investment Banking, supported by UBS, had advised the Mahindras.        
	This is a historic and game-changing day for Tech Mahindra. We have taken on a challenge and we will make it work. To all our customers, I would like to say we will give our highest priority to restoring your confidence and earning your faith in the future of Satyam. I plan to reach out at an appropriate time to some of Satyams largest customers at Cisco, Citibank and General Motors, said Tech Mahindra chairman Anand Mahindra.         
	CEO and managing director Vineet Nayyar emphasised the complementary nature of the deal. Tech Mahindra is a leader in telecom. Satyam, on the other hand, is in areas only marginally in telecom, but is present in all other areas.         
	At Tech Mahindra, we are focused on Europe, 75 per cent of our earnings are in pounds or euros. Seventy per cent of Satyams revenues are in dollars, he said.         
	However, some observers are wondering whether the company has paid the right price for Satyam, given the absence of clarity on the companys finances. Besides, there are about 12 class action suits in the US, whose liabilities are also not known.        
	There are clearly legal liabilities. We have taken a fair assessment of the liabilities. But I cannot be 100 per cent certain, said Nayyar.         
	It is difficult to assess whether Tech Mahindra paid the right price for Satyam since there is a question mark over the books of the company, said investment bankers and analysts.         
	Tech Mahindra was confident of a turnaround in Satyam. The potential is there to raise the margins. It will require a fair amount of hard work. Clearly the main challenge is governance. The next issue will be how we will make it financially viable to bring it on par with industry, said Nayyar.         
	The Satyam scrip rose 3.61 per cent to end at Rs 48.85 on the BSE today, while Tech Mahindra gained 12.31 per cent to Rs 359.45.

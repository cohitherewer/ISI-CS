The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Govt bets big on 3G spectrum auction 
                                                                                                               Govt bets big on 3G spectrum auction 
          JAYATI GHOSE                                    
	New Delhi, July 6: The government expects to rake in Rs 35,000 crore from the auction of 3G spectrum.        
	This is the right time to introduce high-speed 3G services in the country and the government is taking steps to expedite the process, Sanjay Kapok, deputy CEO of Bharti Airtel, told The Telegraph.         
	The telecom ministry wants to initiate the 3G services licence and spectrum auction by the end of 2009.         
	In the interim budget for 2009-10, finance minister Pranab Mukherjee had budgeted Rs 20,000 crore as receipts from the 3G auction.         
	The 3G mobile phone services, seen as the next growth driver for Indian telecom sector, will allow users to surf the Internet or download content, including music and video, at speeds faster than current technologies. The 3G auction, originally scheduled to be held last October 2008, has already been delayed thrice due to inter-ministerial disagreements over issues like the reserve price and the number of blocks to be auctioned.        
	While the finance ministry wants a higher base price at Rs 4,040 crore, the department of telecom (DoT) wants it to be under Rs 3,500 crore. There is also a difference of opinion on the number of slots, with one side wanting it to be restricted to five while DoT wants as many as eight operators to be given 3G spectrum.         
	A quarter of Indias 380 million mobile users is estimated to carry a 3G-enabled handset, but operators cannot offer high-end services as they have not been allotted 3G spectrum yet. State-run BSNL and MTNL already own and operate 3G services. They would have to match the highest auction price in each circle.        
	The government will soon finalise the 3G policy, which has been referred to a group of ministers (GoM) headed by finance minister Pranab Mukherjee. The GoM will take a final call on base price and number of operators to be allowed in each telecom circle.         
	DoT reckons that the Union cabinet should take a call on the 3G proposal, instead of routing the process through a group of ministers.                                      
	, as that would involve a delay of several months. The higher revenue generation would help offset the slowdown in tax receipts following the slowdown in the economy. Analysts said that besides generating extra revenues, the auction could also provide a stimulus to the economy.        
	The price of 3G auction in metro cities and also in some of the A circles should be substantially higher than the reserve price, said Mahesh Uppal, director at telecoms consulting firm Com First. Reserve price matters primarily when the competition is low, he added.        
	The likely bidders include Bharti Airtel, Vodafone Essar, Reliance Communications, Tatas Teleservices and a few new private telecom operators Unitech-Telenor, Sistema-Shyam apart from foreign operators keen to enter the worlds fastest growing telecom market.

                                                                                                               World Bank loan to help support growth
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Calcutta, Sept. 23: The World Bank has sanctioned $4.34 billion  its largest ever development loan to India  to support the governments economic stimulus programme and lending to infrastructure.         
	The loan will be for a maximum tenure of 30 years.        
	World Banks country director for India Roberto Zagha said, This is a crucial time to support India.         
	Supporting infrastructure in India is particularly important during the current crisis, not just to sustain the domestic economy at a time of reduced global demand, but even more to lay the foundations for stronger future growth, Zagha said.        
	The $4.3-billion support would help to maintain credit growth and sustain infrastructure investments in the country.         
	The onset of the global financial crisis in 2008 saw the countrys growth rate declining to below 6 per cent in the fourth quarter of 2008-09.         
	However, current trends suggest that a growth rate of between 5.5 and 6.5 per cent for 2009-10 is realistic, the World Bank said in a statement.         
	Of the $4.34-billion assistance, $2.1 billion will be provided as a banking sector support loan to the government, which can then use this money to enhance the capital of select public sector banks.         
	The World Bank statement said in the wake of the global financial crisis, private and foreign banks slowed down their lending and deposit taking activities and, thereby, increased the demand on public sector banks.         
	This loan will help maintain credit growth levels, the statement said.        
	Another $1.2-billion loan will be provided to India Infrastructure Finance Company Ltd to catalyse private financing for public-private partnerships in infrastructure projects.

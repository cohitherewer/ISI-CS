The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Reliance modifies NTPC plea
                                                                                                               Reliance modifies NTPC plea
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Mumbai, July 30: Bombay High Court today allowed Reliance Industries Ltd to amend its plea in its dispute with National Thermal Power Corporation (NTPC) over gas supplies from the Krishna-Godavari basin.        
	RIL is moving the amendment to emphasise the point that its bid for the NTPC tender in 2004 has been frustrated by the governments policy on gas utilisation and pricing.         
	The Mukesh Ambani flagship also wants to bring on record the affidavit filed by the Centre in the RIL-RNRL case in Bombay High Court last year. In its affidavit, the government had submitted that the price fixed by the empowered group of ministers (EGoM) would be applicable to all sectors uniformly.         
	The EGoM had set the price of gas at $4.20 per million British thermal unit (mBtu). The affidavit filed by the ministry of petroleum and natural gas quoted Article 21.6 of the production sharing contract. This requires the contractor to seek government approval for valuing the gas sold.

	Calcutta, Nov. 11: Mumbai-based Shree Renuka Sugars will acquire Brazilian sugar and ethanol producer Vale Do Ivai (VDI) at an enterprise value of $240 million.         
	An enterprise value, often referred to as the takeover cost, is measured by the market capitalisation plus the outstanding debt in the books of the company.        
	In a filing before the stock exchanges, Shree Renuka today said it had entered into an agreement with the Brazilian firm to acquire its 100 per cent equity capital for around $82 million, while the remaining sum would be funded through debt.        
	We have tied the debt funding at a very low interest rate and it is repayable in eight years, said Narendra Murkumbi, managing director of Shree Renuka Sugars.        
	The Brazilian company was up for distress sale. Shree Renuka will acquire two of its three mills.        
	The acquisition will provide backward integration to Shree Renuka which aims to be the worlds leading white sugar refining company, Murkumbi said.        
	Nearly 70 per cent of VDIs raw material requirement, that is sugarcane, comes from its own plantations. Besides, VDI also exports raw sugar and has a port terminal, Murkumbi said.         
	VDIs plantation is spread over 18,000 hectares in south Brazil.         
	The acquisition will give Shree Renuka both sugar cane as well as raw sugar.        
	The share price of Shree Renuka Sugars today went up 1.66 per cent to Rs 217.85 on the BSE on the news of the overseas acquisition.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Piramal fund plans to invest in Bengal
                                                                                                               Piramal fund plans to invest in Bengal
          SAMBIT SAHA                          Ajay Piramal: Growth mode                                  
	Calcutta, March 16: India Venture Advisors, a private equity fund floated by the Piramal group, is exploring possibilities of investing in Bengal.        
	The fund, which is focused on healthcare, has an initial corpus of Rs 150 crore with a plan to raise Rs 500 crore going forward.        
	We are looking at some projects here, Ajay Piramal, chairman of Piramal Healthcare and head of Piramal Enterprises, said.        
	The fund has recently picked up a stake in Trichy-based speciality hospital group Kavery Medical Centre and Hospitals.         
	We are one of the very few funds to raise such money, he added.         
	All the leading banks and financial institutions have invested in the fund along with some high net worth individuals. Piramal is the lead investor.        
	Incidentally, a number of healthcare projects, especially super speciality hospitals, have been hit by the lack of funding in Bengal.        
	The group has a presence in Bengal through Drs Tribedi amp; Roy Diagnostic Laboratories, which it bought some time back.        
	Piramal said he was confident that the healthcare sector would not be affected by the downturn. We are doing better than the market. A latest report says industry grew 15 per cent last month, while we grew 30 per cent, Piramal said. Given that only 35 per cent of the population gets modern medicine in the country, the scope to grow is enormous.        
	It is a necessity and not a luxury. India is one of the low-cost producers of drugs. So affordability is key, he said.        
	However, the custom manufacturing business, where the company develops drugs for foreign companies could slow down.        
	Piramal Healthcare, formerly Nicholas Piramal, is introducing inhalation anaesthetic and plasma expander  which increases plasma count during crisis in the domestic market.        
	New cancer drug        
	Ajay Piramal said Piramal Lifescience would come out with an anti-cancer molecule in the next two years and probably become one of the first Indian companies to create a new drug. It has a research centre in Mumbai where seven molecules are in various stages of clinical trial.

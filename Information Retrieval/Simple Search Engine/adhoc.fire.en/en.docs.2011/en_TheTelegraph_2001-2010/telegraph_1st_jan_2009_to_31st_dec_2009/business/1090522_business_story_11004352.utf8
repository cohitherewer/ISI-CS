          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Coal India chairman Partha Bhattacharyya in Calcutta on Thursday. (PTI)                                   
	Calcutta, May 21: Coal India may have to raise prices to meet the higher pay of its staff.         
	A 10-12 per cent hike in prices seems imminent after the company revised the wages of its workers and executives in January this year.         
	We had to provide for Rs 7,864 crore in 2008-09 to meet the increased salaries, gratuities and arrears of our employees following the implementation of the National Coal Wage Agreement (VIII) and pay revision for executives in January this year, said Partha S. Bhattacharyya, chairman of Coal India Ltd (CIL).        
	CILs two subsidiaries  Eastern Coalfields Ltd (ECL) and Bharat Coking Coal Ltd (BCCL)  have also added to the cost burden.         
	After providing for the hiked gratuity and arrears, ECL and BCCL ran into losses of Rs 1,000 crore each.         
	Moreover, a study by the Central Mine Planning and Design Institute has revealed that 33 of the 78 planned projects have become unviable under the new salary structure.         
	While ECL and BCCL cannot survive without a hike in prices, we also need to increase the price to make the 33 projects viable, Bhattacharyya said.        
	Public offer        
	CIL is keen to tap the capital markets and get listed on the stock exchanges soon. We have proposed to reserve part of our public issue for the people who will be displaced because of the new projects or expansion, Bhattacharyya said.

        The new direct tax code proposes to bring about radical changes. There are some positives but the code is not without its share of hiccups, say Kaushik Mukerjee amp; Sushmita Basu                                            
	The Direct Taxes Code, proposed to be effective from April 1, 2011, is set to introduce sweeping reforms in tax laws. The thrust is on a simplified structure leading to better compliance, higher tax realisation and less litigation.         
	Changes in tax slabs         
	The code proposes to substantially raise the income slabs for tax purpose (See chart). This will leave more disposable income at the hands of the taxpayers encouraging higher spending. The revenue loss of the government will probably be offset by the proposed goods and services tax, taxation of retirement benefits and better compliance.         
	Expatriate rule        
	Under the existing tax law, there is a separate category for residents but not ordinarily residents (RNOR). It covers non-residents who come to India for the first time to stay for a while, for instance expatriates coming to work in India.         
	Generally, taxable income of such residents for the first three years is restricted to income sourced and received in India.         
	This special category does not find place in the new code.         
	However, foreign income of the first timers will be exempted from tax in the first two years.         
	This is definitely a move towards simplified rules. It will reduce the period for which global income of such persons can remain outside the Indian tax net.         
	This may have a significant implication for inbound expatriates.                     Finance minister Pranab Mukherjee released the Direct Taxes Code in presence of home minister P. Chidambaram in   New Delhi last Wednesday. A Telegraph picture      
	Exemption edge        
	The new code is a departure from the multiple exemption regime. Gross salary (including perks) of an individual will first be considered for taxation. Specified deductions for provisions such as severance payments for voluntary retirement, gratuity etc will then be deducted from the gross salary, subject to deposit of the receipts in retirement benefit accounts like provident and superannuation funds, life insurance and the New Pension Scheme (NPS).         
	The emphasis is on more savings for a secure life post retirement. This is evident from the removal of instruments like unit-linked insurance policies from the list of investments eligible for deduction from the total income (the provision corresponding to Section 80C).         
	Exemptions will now be replaced by the deferral of tax liability. Earlier, permanent exemptions were available even during the working life but now there will only be deferral till the withdrawal from the retirement benefit account. A touch of uncertainty remains on the valuation of perquisites. These will be clarified by the government and one has to wait for the rules to be notified.        
	EET regime        
	The code proposes to usher in exempt, exempt, tax (EET) regime. Contribution to retirement benefit funds will be tax deductible (exempt). The accruals during the tenure of the scheme will not be taxable (exempt). However tax will have to be paid on any withdrawal (tax). There will be grandfathering for PF accumulations up to March 31, 2011.         
	However, clarity is needed on the tax treatment of withdrawal of interest on such accumulations arising after that date. There is a paradigm shift from exemption of retirement benefits to tax deferral. One is not sure whether this provision can be implemented, especially in the case of withdrawal from the provident fund.         
	The regime needs to be properly set up. The taxpayer should get appropriate credit for tax withheld from the income. Past experience from similar schemes like NSS was not pleasant.        
	House property        
	There are two significant changes in computing income from house property. The presumptive deduction of 30 per cent (of rent) for repairs will now stand reduced to 20 per cent, bringing an additional 10 per cent of the rent to tax. Also, the deduction for interest on loans (up to Rs 1.5 lakh) will no longer be available for self-occupied property. Taxpayers will now have to pay interest on home loans from tax paid income with no corresponding benefit of interest deduction.         
	Wealth tax        
	Wealth tax at 0.25 per cent will be charged on net wealth (assets minus related liability) in excess of Rs 50 crore. The increase in the threshold will take a significant number of wealth taxpayers out of the ambit of this tax.         
	However, the new method of defining assets reverts back to the wealth tax regime that existed before 1993. A new method of imposing wealth tax was introduced in 1993 only on specified assets. The idea behind this reversal is unclear.         
	The new code is a mixed bag. The extension of the EET regime will moderate the benefits arising out of the raising of the tax slabs. Moreover, a robust implementation mechanism needs to be in place for the flow of benefits to taxpayers.

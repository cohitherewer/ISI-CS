The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Growth slide sets stage for rate cut
                                                                                                               Growth slide sets stage for rate cut
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                            
	New Delhi, Feb. 27: The Congress-led government will ask the Reserve Bank of India to cut key overnight lending rates by at least 50 basis points as it seeks to come to terms with todays weak growth figures.        
	For the quarter ended December, the economy grew just 5.3 per cent, the lowest in six years, with manufacturing and agriculture shrinking 0.2 per cent and 2.2 per cent, respectively.         
	RBI governor Duvvuri Subbarao is slated to hold policy meetings in Delhi over the weekend with finance ministry mandarins and Planning Commission deputy chairman Montek Singh Ahluwalia.         
	The meetings are expected to carve out a policy response to todays disappointing numbers, which may cause growth for 2008-09 to be less than the forecast of 7.1 per cent.         
	Finance ministry officials said the RBI could cut both the repo, or the rate at which it lends to banks, and the reverse repo, or the rate at which it borrows from banks, by 50 basis points. Since October, the RBI has brought down the repo rate to 5.5 per cent from 9 per cent and the reverse repo to 4 per cent from 6 per cent.        
	Besides, we could see a cut in the cash reserve ratio (CRR), the officials said. CRR, or the amount of money banks have to compulsorily keep with the central bank, could be cut by 50 basis points to release more money.         
	The RBI has already infused around Rs 4 lakh crore through various measures since September.        
	However, the government is expected to mop up around Rs 2.62 lakh crore through its borrowing programme this year, against a budgeted Rs 1.35 lakh crore.         
	Higher government borrowing, which has started in 2009, means the amount available to banks for industry and retail customers will be lower, which will dampen growth impetus.        
	Economists said the RBI needed to cut CRR further. More policy easing will be required. The economy hasnt bottomed out yet, said Sonal Varma, economist at Nomura International. Ficci president Harsh Pati Singhania said it was necessary to create an environment of low interest rates.

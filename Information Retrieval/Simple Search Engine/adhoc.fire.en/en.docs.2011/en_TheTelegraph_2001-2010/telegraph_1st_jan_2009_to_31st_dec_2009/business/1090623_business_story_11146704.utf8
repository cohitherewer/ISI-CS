The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Air India plans Rs 500-cr cut in wage costs
                                                                                                               Air India plans Rs 500-cr cut in wage costs
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Salary woes                                  
	New Delhi, June 22: State-run Air India is planning to slash annual salary costs by Rs 500 crore.        
	A four-member committee has been formed to look at the wage agreements, including flying allowances and productivity linked incentives, between the management and the various unions and associations.        
	Sources said the committee would try to cut down on the variable incentives. However, employee associations are unlikely to accept such a move and may resort to protests and strikes.        
	At present, the annual wage bill of AI is over Rs 3,000 crore and a Rs 500-crore cut will mean a 15 per cent reduction in gross pay.        
	Air India, which is likely to suffer a loss of Rs 4,300 crore in 2008-09, is facing a temporary cash flow imbalance. Airlines in the country are likely to end 2008-09 with a combined loss of Rs 9,000-10,000 crore.        
	The committee has been directed to discuss all aspects of cost rationalisation and reduction of wasteful expenditure with the unions and submit its report by July 15.         
	Besides reducing wage cost, AI is looking at improving the productivity of employees, eliminating restrictive work practices and reducing wasteful expenditure, the airline said.         
	Air India said it had not resorted to retrenchment or layoffs to tide itself over the financial crisis arising out of the difficult market conditions that had affected operators the world over.         
	The latest move comes two days after Air India chairman and managing director Arvind Jadhav appealed to all staff to rise up to the challenge and help the airline in its fight for survival.         
	In a letter to employees, Jadhav stated that all carriers were experiencing poor load factors, a drop in premium travel, a fall in cargo load and low yields, besides being forced to offer low fares.        
	Employees have been receiving their wages, salaries every month even when people in the industry have lost jobs or seen emoluments take a dip. We should consider ourselves fortunate that we have been insulated from the adverse impact of the economic meltdown so far, said Jadhav.

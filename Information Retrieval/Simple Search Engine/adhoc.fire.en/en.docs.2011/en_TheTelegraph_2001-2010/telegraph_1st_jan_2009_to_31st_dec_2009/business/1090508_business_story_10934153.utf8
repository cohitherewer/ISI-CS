The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Fresh funding options

	Mumbai, May 7: Ratan Tata is still in talks with the British government to narrow their differences over a bailout plan for Jaguar Land Rover, sources said here today.         
	Tata is still trying to salvage the talks that appeared to be on the verge of collapse after the UK government refused to issue a guarantee for 450 million in loans from British banks. He is also trying to persuade the British treasury to underwrite 340 million awarded to JLR by the European Investment Bank for green technology development.        
	In London, a spokesperson for the UKs department of business said, The government is having confidential discussions with JLR and its parent over short- and long-term financing plans. These negotiations are continuing.        
	A spokesperson for Jaguar also insisted that they were unaware about any breakdown in talks.        
	However, speculation has increased on the other funding routes that the Tata group can adopt if the bailout talks collapse. Two investment bankers said the most likely option would be to bring in more equity into JLR through an infusion of promoter capital. Funds could be raised by selling stakes in group companies, especially TCS.         
	On Wednesday, Tata Ltd, a UK subsidiary of the groups apex holding firm Tata Sons, sold 1.05 per cent of TCS for Rs 634.80 crore in a single transaction. After the sale, the groups stake in TCS has dipped to 75 per cent, most of which is held through Tata Sons.        
	Unlike India, its far more difficult to get British banks to give concessions or ask them to reschedule debt payments. The easiest option for the group will be to pump in equity if the bailout fails, said one banker.        
	Tata Motors has been trying to refinance $2 billion of debt that it had raised for the JLR buyout. Sources said there had been developments on that front and it was possible that Tata Motors might raise more loans on its balance sheet for refinancing.

                                                                                                               Car sales up 26% in August

	New Delhi, Sept. 8: Car makers braved weak rural demand because of the poor rain to post a 25.59 per cent growth in August sales.        
	The industry hopes to perform even better in the festival season as bonuses doled out during this time of the year are expected to fuel demand.         
	Further growth is expected. The last instalment of the Sixth Pay Commission is also expected to boost demand, said Sugato Sen, a senior director at the Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers (Siam).        
	According to Sen, During the last few months, sales were consistently growing. Of course, in the last month, it was fuelled by some stock build-up at the dealer level for the anticipated festive demand.        
	The low-base effect during the same period last year also had a positive impact on sales.        
	Deficient rain had been a cause for worry as the industry was banking on rural demand to push up sales. September and October, considered auspicious for big purchases, will see a spurt in sales.        
	According to data released by Siam, passenger car sales stood at 1,20,669 units in August compared with 96,082 units in the same month last year. Sale of motorcycles soared 25.94 per cent to 6,11,173 units against 4,85,270 units in the corresponding month a year ago.         
	Overall sales jumped over 24 per cent in August at 10,08,702 units against 8,11,341 units in the year-ago period        
	Its a positive development. But I think we need to wait for some more time before we confirm the sector has recovered, said auto analyst Murad Ali Baig.

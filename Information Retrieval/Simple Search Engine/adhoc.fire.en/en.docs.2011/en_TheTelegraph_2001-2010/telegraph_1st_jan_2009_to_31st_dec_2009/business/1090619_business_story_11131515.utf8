                                                                                                               Guessing game on rate cut
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Mumbai, June 18: Inflation may have turned negative but bankers and economists are not convinced that the RBI will start another round of rate cuts.        
	Observers say the central bank may at best cut key rates by 25 basis points as it will be wary about the possibility of inflation inching up again later this year. A small section believes that the RBI can start raising rates by the end of this year when inflation is expected to start creeping up again.        
	The central bank has already enforced a sharp cut in the benchmark rates since last October. However, many banks are yet to trim their lending rates as aggressively.         
	The RBI has cut the repo rate by 425 basis points and reverse repo by 275 basis points so far since October. The repo is the rate at which the RBI provides funds to banks against the government securities they hold and reverse repo is that at which it absorbs liquidity.        
	Economists and bankers say global oil prices have started climbing and the tardy progress of the monsoon could create inflationary pressures.

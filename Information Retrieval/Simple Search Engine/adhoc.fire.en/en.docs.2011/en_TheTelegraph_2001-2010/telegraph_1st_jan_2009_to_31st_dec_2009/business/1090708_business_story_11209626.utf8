The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Zero-coupon fillip for banks
                                                                                                               Zero-coupon fillip for banks
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Mumbai, July 7: The budget proposal to let banks issue zero-coupon bonds will help them to enhance their long-term lending options.        
	Zero-coupon bonds are issued at a discount and redeemed at par. No interest payment is made on such bonds at periodic intervals before maturity. So far, financial institutions, public sector and infrastructure companies issued such bonds.        
	The budget has now allowed scheduled banks, including nationalised banks, to issue zero-coupon bonds for their long-term funds. Relevant changes in rules will apply retrospectively from April.        
	Bankers welcomed the move as it provided them with one more instrument to raise Tier II funds.         
	Speaking to The Telegraph, Harihar Krishnamurthy, head of treasury at First Rand Bank, said apart from providing banks with one more instrument, the proposal would help them to tap various classes of investors. There may be some investors who may not be keen to invest in bonds which give periodic interest payments. Banks can now tap them, he said. However, Krishnamurthy said the tax implications were not clear.        
	Both the PSU and private banks have been regularly raising funds through Tier II bonds to meet their business requirements and augment their capital adequacy ratio.         
	Besides the zero-coupon bonds, the expectations of banks from the budget remained largely unfulfilled.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Rupee relief for exporters
                                                                                                               Rupee relief for exporters
          OUR BUREAU                                            
	Feb. 18: The rupee dropped to an 11-week low of 50 to the dollar, bringing cheer to exporters who stand to earn more in the Indian currency.        
	Exporters now want the rupee to stay at 48-52 per dollar. The weakening rupee is a good sign. If it continues to be in that range for some weeks, exporters will be benefited, said Ganesh Kumar Gupta, chairman of the Synthetic and Rayon Textile Export Promotion Council.        
	Traders said the rupee fell to 50.10 during the day, its lowest since December 3, but regained some ground on buying from state-run banks. The rupee closed 21 paise lower at 49.93.        
	Fears of the fiscal deficit spiralling out of control caused todays fall. A higher deficit means the government will borrow more from the market at the expense of private investors. In the interim budget, the government said the deficit would be 6 per cent of GDP against the target of 2.5 per cent.        
	Professor K.T. Chacko, director of the Indian Institute of Foreign Trade, said: Exporters who receive proceeds in dollars would be benefited immediately, as they would have got more in rupees.        
	But, for exporters to reap the full benefits of the weakening rupee, the currency has to be in that range for a reasonable period of time as export contracts and price contract deals take time, he said.        
	After registering a handsome growth rate of over 30 per cent in the first half of the current fiscal, exports entered the negative zone in October.        
	The commerce minister has admitted that it would not be possible to meet the annual target of $200 billion for this fiscal. The ministry is now looking at exports of $175-$180 billion.        
	The rupee had an impact on gold prices, too. Prices of the yellow metal crossed Rs 15,500 to an intra-day high of Rs 15,545 before ending at Rs 15,490 in Mumbai.         
	Analysts said another reason for the rupees decline is the weakness of other currencies against the dollar. The dollar rose against the yen and euro today.

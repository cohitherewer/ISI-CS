The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Ambanis knock on Singh door
                                                                                                               Ambanis knock on Singh door
          OUR BUREAU AMP; PTI                              
	Aug. 5: The Ambani brothers, engaged in a bare-knuckle legal battle over the distribution of Krishna-Godavari gas, are believed to have met Prime Minister Manmohan Singh.        
	While Anil Ambani is understood to have met the Prime Minister today, elder brother Mukesh reportedly met Singh yesterday.        
	However, no comments could be obtained from either side.         
	The two brothers are also believed to have met other senior ministers and key officials of the central government.        
	Meanwhile, an associate of Anil today alleged that there was a conflict of interest between the two experts who vetted the development cost of the gasfields in the Krishna-Godavari basin and the contractor that is Reliance Industries.        
	The two experts in question are Mustang Engineering, an international engineering consultant, and P. Gopalakrishnan.        
	J.P. Chalsani, CEO of Reliance Power, a company promoted by Anil, said Mustang Engineering had been advising RIL on various projects and, therefore, had a conflict of interest. Gopalakrishnan, on the other hand, is in the faculty of the School of Petroleum Technology at Gandhinagar in Gujarat. Chalsani said that Mukesh was the schools first president and the chairman of its board of governors.        
	He said these facts were not disclosed to the government.         
	The government, Chalsani says, stands to lose Rs 30,000 crore revenue because of the inflated capex, as RIL is entitled to recover the entire cost before sharing revenues with the government.        
	DGH reply        
	Replying to Chalsanis charges, V.K. Sibal, the director-general of hydrocarbons, said in New Delhi that RILs cost of gas production even after the higher capex was comparable to any other field in the country.         
	On the experts, he said Mustang was selected through an international bid, while Gopalakrishnan was on DGHs panel. The cost of production for Dhirubhai 1 and 3 fields at the approved field development rate of $8.8 billion came to $1.28 per million British thermal unit, he said.

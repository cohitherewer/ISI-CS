The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Global worries far from over
                                                                                                               Global worries far from over
                            
	Tokyo/London, June 22 (Reuters): The Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) added to a grim outlook from the World Bank on Monday, saying major economies would contract throughout 2009 and the problem of unemployment would linger.         
	We see a very difficult 2009, with negative growth in the OECD area. Unemployment problems are going to linger, Angel Gurria, the head of the OECD, said.         
	Earlier in the day, a World Bank report said prospects for the global economy remained unusually uncertain as it cut 2009 growth forecasts for most economies.         
	The report said the world economy would contract by 2.9 per cent in calendar 2009 against an earlier estimate of a negative growth rate of 1.7 per cent.        
	Governments around the world have borrowed hundreds of billions of dollars to fight the worst economic crisis in decades, providing incentives for businesses and consumers to spend and embarking on big infrastructure programmes to create jobs and stimulate activity.        
	They should stick to spending programmes to reignite growth as their economies are still weak in spite of signs that the worst of the crisis may be past, World Bank chief economist Justin Lin said.        
	Sensex hit        
	The World Bank report had an impact on the Bombay Stock Exchanges sensex.        
	It had resumed firm in morning trade with Asian markets rising but declined to a low of 14269.77 following a fall in European markets because of the World Bank prediction. The sensex fell 196 points to close at 14326.22.

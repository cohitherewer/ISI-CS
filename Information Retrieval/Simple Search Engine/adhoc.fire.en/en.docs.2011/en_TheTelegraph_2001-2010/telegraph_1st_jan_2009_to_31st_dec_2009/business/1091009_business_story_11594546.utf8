The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Montek prefers aggression
                                                                                                               Montek prefers aggression
                              Ahluwalia: Action time                             
	New Delhi, Oct. 8 (PTI): Montek Singh Ahluwalia, deputy chairman of the Planning Commission, today said the government should divest aggressively to mobilise funds for development in critical areas such as health, education and infrastructure.        
	We are taking a string of individual decisions to divest and I think the market conditions are good. So, divestment will take place, Ahluwalia said.        
	According to the plan panel chief, the government will ensure that its stake in state-owned companies does not drop below 51 per cent.        
	Subject to that policy, we should use divestment as aggressively as possible in order to maintain a larger plan size, he said.        
	I personally feel that we should use the fullest flexibilities that we have. As long as 51 per cent is in the governments hands, nobody should be worried about that, he said.        
	In its second stint, the UPA government has gone for divestment in NHPC and Oil India through public issues.

          OUR CORRESPONDENT                          Pressure point                                  
	New Delhi, Jan. 3: The Employees Provident Fund Organisation (EPFO) is putting pressure on the State Bank of India to pay a penalty for keeping funds idle for more than a day.        
	The EPFO has written to the SBI, but the bank has not agreed to pay penalty interest, said sources.        
	The SBI is one of the four fund managers for the EPFO. Earlier, in an agreement, private companies agreed to pay penalty interest for keeping funds idle for more than one working day.         
	The three private fund managers appointed by the EPFO are Reliance Capital, HSBC Asset Management Company and ICICI Prudential AMC        
	On a day-to-day basis, as high as Rs 150 crore could be sitting idle in SBI vaults till they reach EPFOs accounts. For over two years now, the EPFO has been asking the SBI to give some kind of return on these funds as they are used in the banks operations, said sources.        
	SBI officials said they were looking into the matter but a final decision had not been taken. In the case of a denial by the SBI, the EPFO has the option to replace the bank, they said.        
	Sources said, Since this matter was raised by members of the Finance and Investment Committee in its recent meeting held on December 10, the EPFO will have to tighten the noose around the SBI to get its nod as other fund managers have already agreed to it.        
	The provident fund has around four crore subscribers.        
	Earlier, in a letter to the EPFO, the SBI expressed its inability to share income earned on idle funds. The letter indicated that the SBI had the notion of idle funds being those held up for more than two working days whereas the new agreement redefined that.              
	Earlier this year, the EPFO had started a process to replace SBI as its banker since the state-run lender failed to come up with a satisfactory treatment of idle provident funds.        
	The EPFO had also shortlisted 10 fund managers to replace SBI. However, the matter         
	In July 2008, SBI cited reserve bank of India guidelines for its inability to share returns on idle funds with EPFO. However, it had offered to pay interest equivalent to what is paid on savings accounts.         
	Savings accounts are credited interest on the basis of the minimum balance in the latter half of a month. So, if idle funds are transferred to EPFOs investment accounts during the time, EPFO would get zero interest.         
	To counter this, EPFO asked SBI to pay interest on daily running balances rather than on a monthly basis. However, SBI said this cant be done as per the savings account rules.

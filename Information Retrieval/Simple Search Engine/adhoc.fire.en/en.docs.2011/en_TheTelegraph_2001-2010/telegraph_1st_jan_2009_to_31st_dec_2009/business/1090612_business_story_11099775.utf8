The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Satyam to bench 24% staff
                                                                                                               Satyam to bench 24% staff
          OUR BUREAU                          Fresh twist                                  
	June 11: Satyam Computer Services today announced plans to create the largest bench in the software industry  what it termed as a virtual pool of 8,000 to 10,000 software professionals who would be on reduced pay for a period of six months.        
	The decision was taken at a meeting of the board of directors in Hyderabad. The plan staves off the threat of job losses that hung over the 41,622 employees of the fraud-wracked software giant.        
	The virtual pool will house almost 24 per cent of Satyams employees. Associates picked for the virtual bench will receive basic pay in addition to provident fund and medical insurance.        
	The bench will comprise employees who havent held a billable role in the past three months. The one-time programme will apply only to those employees based in India. Satyam said it was aimed at addressing staff costs while retaining talent within the company.        
	It isnt yet clear what will happen to the people on the bench at the end of six months. The company, however, held out some hope for those who were banished to the virtual pool  it said that based on business requirements, the employees on the bench could be reinstated with full pay and benefits.        
	In a mail to the employees, Satyam chief executive A. S. Murty said, People-related costs account for almost 60 per cent of our revenues. In our current situation, we have a sizeable number of associates who are not on billable assignments while business support and strategic support units have to contend with reduced activity/scale. The people cost  as a percentage of our revenues  has therefore increased dramatically.        
	Murty said the failure to address this problem quickly and effectively would result in the companys inability to make timely payments to associates and vendors, reducing customer and investor confidence.         
	Obviously, there is no single right answer for this complex and unprecedented situation. Each organisation or individual may choose to address this in varied ways. Our board of directors has approved an innovative and humane model to address this crisis which we have christened as VPP (virtual pool programme), he said.        
	Murty told the associates that Satyam had tied up with approved organisations to assist in outplacement support should the employees need it.        
	The announcement comes a day ahead of Tech Mahindras open offer to acquire 20 per cent from Satyam shareholders.        
	The open offer is likely to receive a poor response from shareholders as the current market price is higher than the open offer price of Rs 58 per share. Satyam shares were locked again at the upper circuit and closed at Rs 80.85.        
	There are indications that Tech Mahindra will not raise the open offer price. Under the terms of agreement for the Satyam buyout, the software company will make a preferential offer to Tech Mahindra if it fails to mop up another 20 per cent from the open offer. Tech Mahindra has a 31 per cent stake in Satyam after it came up with a winning bid of Rs 58 a share in mid-April.        
	Meanwhile, Satyam said in a regulatory filing with the US market regulator that one of the top executives of the software giant was planning to sell his shares in the open offer.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Dhoot offers to use coal found at site
                                                                                                               Dhoot offers to use coal found at site
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Dhoot: Eyeing reserves                                  
	Calcutta, Oct. 13: Videocon wants to use the coal found under its proposed steel plant site in Burdwan for its planned power plant.        
	Chairman Venugopal Dhoot today met chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee and requested him to allocate the coal to Videocon.        
	The company had sought 4,200 acres, but the state had allowed 3,000 acres for a 3-million-tonne steel plant and a 1200MW power unit. Videocon had decided to acquire the land on its own.        
	The state had earmarked the location. But Coal India says there is 600mt of coal beneath the plot. We have requested the chief minister to allocate the reserves to us, Dhoot said.        
	The company had signed an agreement with the state two years back and zeroed on Jamuria near Asansol for the plant. It had also applied for a steam coal block to set up a captive power plant.        
	Videocon is yet to get an allocation but the state has recommended the Nachen coal block. We need coal in any case. If the coal under our site is offered to us, it would be the best solution. In that case, we do not require the Nachen block, Dhoot said.        
	The other options include relocating the project, which means a significant delay and a cost overrun, or realigning the project to leave out coal bearing areas, Gautam Sengupta, chief operating officer of Videocon, said.        
	The chief minister has asked Dhoot to sort out the problem with the coal ministry as coal is under the central government, sources said. The chief minister assured Videocon that he would also look into the matter, a source said.         
	If we use the coal ourselves, the project would still have to be realigned but it would not be major. The company plans to approach the Centre soon, Sengupta said.        
	Coal India chairman Partha Bhattacharyya said his company had told the Bengal government that a large section of the 8,000 acres it wanted to allocate for three projects were in coal bearing areas.        
	Some of them belong to CIL subsidiary ECL. The state had agreed that it would leave out those areas, Bhattacharyya said.        
	Shyam Steel        
	Shyam Steel chairman S.S. Beriwala said administrative delay was affecting the companys proposed steel project at Raghunathpur. It required 600 acres for the first phase of the 1.2mt steel plant and 200MW power plant.        
	The company acquired 100 acres and the government had promised to lease out 500 acres. Beriwala said the project may turn unviable if land allocation was further delayed. He was speaking to reporters for the first time after taking over as the president of the Merchants Chamber of Commerce.

                                                                                                               Uco Bank net rises 35%
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      SK GOEL in Calcutta                          
	Calcutta, May 8: Uco Bank today reported a 35.44 per cent growth in net profit at Rs 558 crore for 2008-09 against Rs 412.16 crore in the previous year.         
	Net profit for the January-March quarter, however, witnessed an increase of only 19.25 per cent at Rs 102.56 crore against Rs 85.99 crore in the year-ago period.        
	According to chairman S.K. Goel, the higher profitability came on the back of a nearly 50 per cent growth in profits from treasury operations and a higher recovery of non-performing assets.         
	Our profit from treasury in 2008-09 was Rs 314 crore against Rs 210 crore in the previous year, Goel said. The bank made a recovery of Rs 78 crore (Rs 66 crore) from written-off accounts and a total recovery of Rs 676 crore (Rs 583 crore), including upgradation of sub-standard loans.         
	Total business grew 25.34 per cent to Rs 1,69,890 crore. Deposits grew 25.42 per cent to Rs 1,00,221 crore, while advances moved up 25.24 per cent to Rs 69,669 crore.              
	Because of pressure on its net interest margin, income from the core business in the domestic market stood at Rs 156 crore, lower than the other income (including treasury profits) of Rs 206 crore.

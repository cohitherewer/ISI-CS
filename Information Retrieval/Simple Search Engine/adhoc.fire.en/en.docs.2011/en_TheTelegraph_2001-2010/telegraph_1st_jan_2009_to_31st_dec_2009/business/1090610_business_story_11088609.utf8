                                                                                                               Hurdles to Telenor stake buy
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, June 9: The government has deferred for the second time a proposal by Unitech Wireless to sell up to 74 per cent of its equity to Norwegian telecom firm Telenor.        
	Delhi-based realty firm Unitech had earlier offloaded a 67.25 per cent stake in its telecom venture for Rs 6,120 crore to Telenor. The four-tranche deal is set to be completed by the year-end.         
	The proposal to increase foreign investment to 74 per cent in Unitech Wireless has been deferred as the home ministry has asked for more time to examine the deal, said officials of the Foreign Investment Promotion Board.        
	FDI proposals        
	The government today cleared 23 FDI proposals, which will bring Rs 564.80 crore into India, including Dubai-based Damas plan for retail trading in jewellery and Danones plans to re-enter the food products space after exiting from Britannia earlier this year.

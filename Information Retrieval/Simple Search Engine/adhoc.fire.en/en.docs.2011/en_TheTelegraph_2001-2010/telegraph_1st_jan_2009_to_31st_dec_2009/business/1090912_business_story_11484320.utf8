          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Calcutta, Sept. 11: Adhunik Metaliks will invest Rs 3,350 crore in its wholly owned power and mining subsidiaries over the next three years. It also plans to come out with a maiden public offer for at least one of the firms to raise funds.        
	The company, which makes speciality steel for the auto and engineering industry, is setting up a 540-mega-watt power plant near Jamshedpur for Rs 2,650 crore. Besides, it is building an iron ore beneficiation plant, a pellet plant, a ferro alloy unit and a power facility to strengthen the mining business.        
	Manoj Agarwal, managing director of Adhunik Metaliks, said the power business would raise private equity worth Rs 400 crore, while Rs 200 crore would be mopped up by mining.        
	For the power business, the company has also tied up loans of 2,000 crore. In mining, it has lined up Rs 450 crore of loans. The company has so far invested Rs 250 crore in both the businesses.        
	Adhunik Metaliks, which is the holding company of mining arm Orissa Manganese and Mining Ltd and power firm Adhunik Power and Natural Resources, will also raise Rs 250 crore equity to reduce debt.        
	The company has passed an enabling resolution to raise Rs 250 crore through an equity offering. We are working on that, CFO Arun Kedia said. While the board is discussing the preferred route, it is likely to be a QIP issue. Adhunik has a debt of over Rs 1,200 crore, and the company wants to bring it down to below Rs 1,000 crore. Orissa Manganese and Mining, on the other hand, is likely to go for an IPO. It has about 90 million tonnes of iron ore and 50 million tonnes of manganese ore reserves.

                                                                                                               Healthy rise in HDFC profit
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                           Deepak Parekh in Mumbai on Wednesday. (PTI)                                  
	Mumbai, July 22: Housing Development Finance Corporation Ltd (HDFC) has posted a 21 per cent rise in net profit at Rs 564.92 crore for the quarter ended June 30 against Rs 468.11 crore a year ago, in line with expectations.         
	Income grew to Rs 2,792.89 crore from Rs 2,313.48 crore in the year-ago period.         
	Loan approvals during the period stood at Rs 12,259 crore against Rs 9,996 crore a year ago, an increase of 23 per cent. Disbursements rose 21 per cent to Rs 8,688 crore from Rs 7,204 crore.         
	On a sequential basis, the growth in individual loan approvals and disbursements during the quarter was 45 per cent and 19 per cent, respectively, compared with the quarter ended March 31, 2009.         
	Addressing the shareholders at the annual general meeting here today, HDFC chairman Deepak Parekh said the company would soon be issuing warrants simultaneously with secured redeemable non-convertible debentures to qualified institutional buyers.        
	He said the warrants could be exchanged at a later date for a maximum of 1,09,53,706 shares constituting up to 3.5 per cent of the expanded issued and paid-up equity share capital of the company.         
	The secured redeemable non-convertible debentures will not exceed Rs 4,000 crore, Parekh said, adding that the funds were being mobilised through qualified institutional placements to augment long-term resources.         
	He said there was demand for home loans, and the average size of loans had increased to Rs 15.40 lakh.         
	The quarterly numbers, however, failed to impress the stock market. On the Bombay Stock Exchange, HDFC lost nearly 5.6 per cent to close at Rs 2,380.65.

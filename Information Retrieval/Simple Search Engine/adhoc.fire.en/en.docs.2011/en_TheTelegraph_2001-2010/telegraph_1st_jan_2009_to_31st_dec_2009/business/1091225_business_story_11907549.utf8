	Calcutta, Dec. 24: The finance ministry is working on a mechanism to provide fertiliser subsidy directly to farmers.         
	I am talking to the agriculture ministry on how to rationalise fertiliser subsidy so that it can be provided directly to farmers, finance minister Pranab Mukherjee said on the sidelines of the annual general meeting of the Bharat Chamber of Commerce here today.         
	I dont want a mere reduction in the governments subsidy burden because that can affect the most vulnerable section of society, he said.        
	Mukherjee said the huge fiscal deficit could not be sustained for long. He proposes to restore fiscal balance through subsidy rationalisation and a wider revenue base. Reforms through the introduction of the new direct tax code and goods and services tax have already been proposed.         
	He said there was a cost push element in food inflation.        
	In the last five years, the minimum support price for wheat has increased Rs 450 per quintal and for paddy it has gone up by Rs 400 per quintal.        
	The over 120-crore population of the country cannot be fed unless we produce enough. Farmers wont produce enough unless they get a fair and remunerative price, Mukherjee said.

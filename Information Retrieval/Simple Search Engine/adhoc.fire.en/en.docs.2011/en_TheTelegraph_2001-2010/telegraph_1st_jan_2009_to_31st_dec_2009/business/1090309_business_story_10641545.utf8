                                                                                                               Discount dilemma
        Dont get carried away by the cheap loans available on the racks. Beware of the hidden costs, warns Srikumar Bondyopadhyay                                        
	Its raining discounts for home loans. Prospective buyers are flooded with attractive offers from banks, but beware of the devil in the fine print. What appears to be a cheap option now may turn out to be a bitter pill to swallow later.        
	In recent times, banks have announced home loans at affordable rates.         
	The State Bank of India is offering home loans at 8 per cent interest for one year.         
	Its existing borrowers, however, continue to pay around 10 per cent interest rate.         
	Uco Bank has announced a discount of 0.50 percentage point on new home loans for the full tenure.         
	Canara Bank is offering a fixed rate of 8.25 per cent in the first year and 9.25 per cent in the next four years for loans up to Rs 20 lakh.         
	Look before you leap        
	But are these special packages good enough to lure you into signing a deal?         
	Most of these offers are teaser rates  a low interest rate offered for a limited period after which it is realigned to the prevailing card rates of the lender bank.         
	Borrowers generally go by the low teaser rate and tend to overlook the realignment after the offer period closes.         
	Later on, when the rate is reset, the borrower is sure to be taken aback by the increase in the equated monthly instalments.        
	A closer look at the mortgage crisis in the US would reveal that the sub-prime problem had its roots in the teaser rates offered on home loans.        
	ABN Amro was the first bank to introduce teaser rates in India in 2000 when it offered a 6.5 per cent fixed rate for the first three years of the loan tenure.         
	When the interest rate was reset in 2003, market rates were on their way up. Many of those who took a home loan from the bank in 2000 are now shelling out hefty EMIs.        
	Measure for measure        
	Let us now consider the special home loan offers of the State Bank of India, Uco Bank and Canara Bank.         
	Under its Happy Home offer, the SBI is offering a fixed interest rate of 8 per cent for the first year after which it will be reset.         
	The reset terms state that the normal interest rate will be applicable, i.e., spreads below/above SBAR (State Bank Advance Rate) as applicable on the date of sanction in the case of floating rate, and applicable fixed rate on the date of sanction in the case of fixed rate loans.         
	The SBIs benchmark advance rate now stands at 12.25 per cent and the bank currently offers a Rs 20-lakh loan for 20 years at 1.75 percentage points below the SBAR.         
	For loans up to Rs 20 lakh, Canara Bank provides fixed interest rates at 8.25 per cent for the first year and 9.25 per cent for the second to the fifth year. From the sixth year, the rate will be restored to the banks prime lending rate (PLR) minus 2.50 percentage points, subject to a minimum of 10 per cent.         
	This means even if the banks PLR falls below 12 per cent after five years, the borrower will still have to pay interest at the rate of 10 per cent.        
	Uco Banks 0.50 per cent discount will be available throughout the tenure of a loan. However, the benefit will be available only at the end of the loan repayment schedule.         
	The EMI will be set on the basis of the prevailing card rate and the accrued benefit because of the discount will be adjusted against the principal outstanding at the close of the tenure. Thus, a borrower will have to pay lesser number of EMIs than the original schedule.        
	The right pick        
	Let us examine which of the above three offers will benefit a borrower.         
	We have done calculations for a Rs 20-lakh home loan taken for 20 years (see chart), while assuming that the PLRs of individual banks do not change throughout the course of the loan repayment.         
	The table shows that the discount in Uco Banks offer is more beneficial than the teaser rates offered by the SBI and Canara Bank.         
	This is because in the initial years, a large part of the EMI will go towards interest payment and only a very small portion is appropriated towards principal repayment. So, in the case of a teaser rate, the interest burden goes up when the rate is restored after the initial years of low interest rate payment.        
	Hence, it is advisable to ask for an illustrative loan repayment schedule that takes into consideration the teaser rate being restored to the current card rate. Cheap is not always good economics, after all.

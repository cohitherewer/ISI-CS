The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Bonus bonanza for staff
                                                                                                               Bonus bonanza for staff
          SOUNAK MITRA                              
	Calcutta, March 18: IBM is offering a hefty bonus to its employees this year at a time when it has been laying off workers globally.        
	In some cases, the bonus will exceed the monthly salary. It will be given with the salaries at the end of this month.         
	The bonus has two components  one linked to an employees performance; the other to profits earned.        
	According to sources, a consistent performance over the last few quarters has prompted IBM to announce this hefty bonus.         
	The company is projected to put up a good show in the future.        
	This is an unexpected news and all IBMers are flying high, an IBM employee working as a mid-level developer told The Telegraph. Last year, the profit component was not there, and the total bonus was not so good.        
	Entry and mid-level developers who got a bonus of Rs 6,000-7,000 last year will get Rs 12,000-15,000 this year. Managers at junior levels in Calcutta are set to get over Rs 1 lakh, the employee said.        
	However, he could not give the percentage break-up. IBM spokespersons refused to comment, saying, We cannot comment on compensations.        
	The IBM staff are also offering gifts to colleagues that are funded by the company. Gifts are not new, but this year the quantity has increased, said another IBM employee in Calcutta.        
	According to the IBM website, the performance bonus is 2-8 per cent of a staffs annual earning, while the high-flyers can get more.        
	In an internal memo in January, IBM chief executive officer Sam Palmisano had said, I am pleased to announce that we will be paying bonuses to IBMers worldwide, based on individual performance.         
	Further, our salary increase plan will continue, covering about 60 per cent of our workforce.        
	As always, increases will go to our highest performers and contributors, he said.

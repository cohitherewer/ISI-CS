                                                                                                               Bankers bet on cut in CRR
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          D.L. Rawal in Calcutta on Tuesday. A Telegraph picture                                  
	Calcutta, July 14: Bankers expect the Reserve Bank of India to reduce the cash reserve ratio (CRR)  the percentage of deposits that banks keep with the apex bank  in its first-quarter monetary policy review on July 28. The reserve ratio now stands at 5 per cent.         
	A reduction in CRR is more likely because the Reserve Bank of India will have to ensure that there is always enough liquidity in the system for private borrowers, while carrying out market borrowings on behalf of the government to finance its fiscal deficit of over Rs 4,00,000 crore, Dena Bank chairman D.L. Rawal said while addressing a seminar organised by the eastern regional council of Ficci here today.        
	Changes in CRR directly impact the liquidity available with commercial banks for lending. A 0.50 percentage point reduction in the CRR will help banks to lend an additional Rs 20,000 crore without increasing their lending rates.         
	According to Rawal, there was little growth in credit in the first quarter (April to June). However, with the onset of the busy season from August, demand for credit  both retail and institutional  will go up.         
	During the current fiscal, Dena Bank is targeting a 20 per cent growth in deposits as well as in advances. We are looking at a total business of Rs 85,000 crore against Rs 72,000 crore in 2008-09, Rawal said. The bank has asked for a capital infusion of Rs 500 crore from the government.

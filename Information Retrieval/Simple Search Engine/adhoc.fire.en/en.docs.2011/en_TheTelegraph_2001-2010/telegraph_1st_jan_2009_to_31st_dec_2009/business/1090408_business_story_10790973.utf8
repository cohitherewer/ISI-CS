	Hyderabad, April 7: The CBI today brought charges against B. Ramalinga Raju and eight others in the Satyam fraud case.        
	The investigating agency filed the 300-page chargesheet in the designated court here against Raju, his brothers Suryanarayana Raju and Rama Raju and six others.        
	The CBI charged the accused under sections 120-B (criminal conspiracy), 420 (cheating), 419 (cheating by personation), 467 (forgery of valuable security), 468 (forgery for the purpose of cheating), 471 (using forged documents as genuine), 477-A (falsification of accounts) and 201 of IPC (causing disappearance of evidence).        
	If convicted under section 467, Raju may face life imprisonment.        
	The CBI said it would file another chargesheet in a day or two. Except for Suryanarayana Raju, all others are in judicial custody and are lodged inside the Chanchalguda jail here.        
	The others named in the chargesheet include former Satyam CFO Vadlamani Srinivas, vice-president (finance) G. Ramakrishna, and two employees D. Venkatpathi Raju and Srisailam, both in the finance department. The chargesheet has also named two sacked auditors of Price Waterhouse  S Gopalakrishnan and Talluri Srinivas.        
	Price Waterhouse expressed surprise and disappointment at the charges brought against its former employees. A spokesman said neither auditors had anything to do with the fraud and there was no evidence of criminal wrongdoing on their part.        
	The fraud perpetrated by Raju and his cohorts was designed to and did circumvent PW Indias audit process; the two Satyam audit partners and PW India were victims of that fraud, he said.         
	The court today allowed the CBI to obtain specimen signatures and hand-writing samples of Ramalinga Raju and four others within the next two days in the court itself.        
	Raju inflated sales        
	Satyams former chief financial officer Vadlamani Srinivas has told the ICAI that the companys sales were inflated and bank statements had been forged to justify the claim.        
	He (Vadlamani) told the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India team that they (former Satyam management) only inflated sales. He said the firm has 600-odd major clients, some of whose sales receipts were doubled.        
	Then they showed in the (fake) bank statements that they received the money within 90 days, ICAI president Uttam Prakash Agarwal told reporters.        
	According to Agarwal, Vadlamani said the whole scam started as an adjustment of Rs 10 crore around five to six years ago and the malpractice continued quarter after quarter before it attained unmanageable proportions in the second quarter of 2008.        
	Union plea        
	A union of IT and BPO workers has written to the Election Commission to stall the Satyam sale process till a new government takes over and the CBI investigations reach a logical conclusion.

          JAYATI GHOSE                          Sardana: Set to start                                  
	New Delhi, June 13: Tata Teleservices, which will launch its GSM services later this month, is betting big on number portability to wean away subscribers from existing operators.        
	Mobile number portability will definitely assist in attracting subscribers from existing GSM players, Anil Sardana, managing director of Tata Teleservices, told The Telegraph.        
	There is a 50 per cent churn in the GSM market every year. Therefore, there is a large market segment for us to address, he said.        
	Number portability gives cellphone users the freedom to choose and change their mobile operators while retaining their numbers.         
	The government plans to introduce the service by October this year.        
	According to an IDC survey, 30 per cent of the mobile subscribers are likely to shift to an operator offering better service, if given an option.        
	In a market having many operators and confusing options, customers will move  given the opportunity  to a brand that offers relevant new applications and services that make everyday life simpler and more enjoyable, said Deepak Gulati, president of GSM business, Tata Teleservices.        
	The company, in which Japans NTT DoCoMo has a 26 per cent stake, said it would invest $2 billion (Rs 9,450 crore) till March 2010 for a pan-India rollout of GSM services. The $2-billion investment is towards network capacity expansion, said Sardana.        
	Operations will be commercially launched in south India by the end of June. By the end of fiscal 2009, the company will roll out services across the country.

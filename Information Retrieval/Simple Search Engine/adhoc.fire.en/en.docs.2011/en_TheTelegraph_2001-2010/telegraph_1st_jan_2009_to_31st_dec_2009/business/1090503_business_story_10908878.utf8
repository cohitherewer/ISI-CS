                                                                                                               SBI cuts deposit rates again
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Crunch time                                  
	Mumbai, May 2: The State Bank of India (SBI) has trimmed interest on term deposits by 25 basis points across all maturities, its second cut in a month. The revised deposit rate structure will be effective from May 4.         
	Last month, the SBI lowered deposit rates by 25-50 basis points across various maturities, raising hopes that the countrys largest bank could lower its lending rates.        
	Subsequently, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) on April 21, slashed both the repo and the reverse repo rate by 25 basis points to 4.75 per cent and 3.25 per cent, respectively. The repo is the rate at which the RBI provides funds to banks and the reverse repo is the rate at which it absorbs liquidity. Both cuts were seen as a move to prod banks to bringdown interest rates.         
	Recently, ICICI Bank had brought down its floating reference rate (FRR) by half a percentage point to 13.25 per cent. The FRR cut benefited its consumer loan borrowers.         
	On Thursday, Punjab National Bank lowered its benchmark prime lending rate by 50 basis points and revised its deposit rates by 25-100 basis points across all maturities.        
	State-run banks such as the SBI, the Bank of Baroda, and Uco Bank may soon bring down their lending rates in line with lower cost of funds.         
	The State Bank Advance Rate, the rate used by the SBI to price home and other loans, now stands at 12.25 per cent.        
	The SBI will offer an interest rate of 3.75 per cent on deposits with a maturity bucket of 15-45 days from 4 per cent earlier. Similarly, interest rate on deposits of 46-90 days will stand at 4.75 per cent (5 per cent) and for 91-180 days will be at 6 per cent (6.25 per cent).        
	Interest rates on deposits in the maturity bucket of 181 days to less than 1 year will be 6.75 per cent from 7 per cent earlier and those from one year to less than two years will stand revised to 7.50 per cent against 7.75 per cent earlier.

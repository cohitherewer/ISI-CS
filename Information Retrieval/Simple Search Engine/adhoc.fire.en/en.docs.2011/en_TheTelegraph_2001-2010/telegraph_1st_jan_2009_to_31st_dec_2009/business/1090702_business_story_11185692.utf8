                                                                                                               Exports slide 29% in May
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, July 1: Exports fell by 29.2 per cent in May  the eighth continuous month of decline caused by the recession in the US and Europe. The fall in exports is expected to prompt the government to announce a slew of incentives.        
	Government data released today said exports shrank to $11 billion in May; the decline was 33.2 per cent in April.        
	Imports dropped 39.2 per cent to $16.21 billion in May, lowering the trade deficit by half to $5.20 billion. Imports are down for five months running.        
	The declining trend in exports is witnessed across all sectors. We have recommended certain incentives for the export sector in the upcoming budget and we hope some relief will be given, commerce minister Anand Sharma said.        
	The commerce ministry has recommended an increase in the interest subsidy on loans.        
	Sharma said initial estimates suggested that exports had contracted 30 per cent in June, and recovery was expected after September.        
	It (continuous fall in exports) is a matter of concern. There are no signs of revival in demand yet. I expect more sops for exporters in the budget, commerce secretary Rahul Khullar told reporters here. He said the gems and jewellery trade was picking up.        
	Besides lower interest rates, the government may offer easy credit and tax refunds.        
	Khullar said exporters had raised concern over the rising rupee because of the inflow of foreign funds. The domestic currency had appreciated about 23 per cent in 2008.

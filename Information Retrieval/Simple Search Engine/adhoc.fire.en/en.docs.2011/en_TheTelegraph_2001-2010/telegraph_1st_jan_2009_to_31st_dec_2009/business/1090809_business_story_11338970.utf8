          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Petroleum minister Murli Deora (second from left) with his deputy Jitin Prasada (extreme left) and secretary R.S. Pandey (second from right) in Mumbai on Saturday. (PTI)                                        
	Mumbai, Aug. 8: The government today launched the eighth round of the New Exploration Licensing Policy (Nelp-VIII). This is the largest-ever auction of oil and gas exploration blocks and the Centre hopes that the latest edition will attract $3-4 billion in investments from both domestic and foreign players.        
	The exercise comes at a time when the Ambani brothers are engaged in a dispute over gas supply from the Krishna Godavari basin. However, petroleum ministry officials feel the row will not have any impact on the auction. There will be no effect because of this. I dont see any adverse effect on the bidding rounds, petroleum secretary R.S. Pandey said.        
	On April 9, India had launched the eighth round of auction of blocks under Nelp and August 10 was fixed as the last date for bidding. But it was deferred within a week over ambiguity on tax holidays for natural gas.        
	After finance minister Pranab Mukherjee extended the seven-year income tax holiday to natural gas production in this years budget, the government decided to relaunch the auction. The last date for bidding is October 12.        
	Several multinational and domestic oil companies were present at the first roadshow for Nelp-VIII today.        
	Apart from domestic majors such as Oil and Natural Gas Corporation Ltd, Bharat Petroleum, Hindustan Petroleum, Indian Oil and Reliance Industries, overseas majors Niko, BG, Cairn Energy and Shell were present.        
	Under Nelp-VIII, the government is offering 70 exploration blocks covering an area of 1,63,535 sq km. It is also making a simultaneous offer of 10 blocks under the fourth round of coal bed methane policy (CBM-IV) for exploration and production of the gas.        
	The blocks offered under CBM-IV cover an area of about 5000 sq km and are spread over seven states.        
	So far, 68 oil and gas discoveries have been made under Nelp in 19 exploration blocks         
	Pricing issue        
	Reiterating its earlier stand, the Centre today said that while oil and gas prices would continue to be fixed on an arms length basis, it would be subject to the governments approval before sale.        
	The production sharing contract provides for gas sales on arms-length basis, but there is another provision that it has to be approved by the government prior to the sale, Pandey said.

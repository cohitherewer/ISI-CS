The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | ITC ready to up ante in EIH turf war 
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      ITC ready to up ante in EIH turf war 
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                                            
	New Delhi, Nov. 25: Cigarettes-to-hotels major ITC Ltd today sent out a veiled threat to EIH (formerly East India Hotels) and Max India chairman Analjit Singh by saying it could launch an open offer and raise its stake in the hospitality major that runs the Oberoi chain of hotels.        
	ITC holds 14.98 per cent in EIH. It had acquired a little over 6 per cent in EIH in early 2001. The Calcutta-based firm has raised its holding gradually and bought its latest tranche of shares in March. However, ITC has always maintained that it has no intentions of mounting a hostile takeover bid for EIH.        
	The Oberois have never felt comfortable with ITCs holding. After ITCs last share purchase, which brought it within a striking distance of a 15 per cent threshold that would make an open offer mandatory under takeover rules, the Oberois started talks with serial entrepreneur Analjit Singh. The Oberois hold 46.42 per cent in EIH, while Singh has a little over 5 per cent.        
	In mid-October, EIH had said its founders were in talks with Singh to sell part of their stake in the company that runs the Oberoi and Trident chain of hotels. Singh had apparently agreed to pick up another 17 per cent that the Oberois wanted to offload.         
	If circumstances change, we may rethink our plans, ITC chairman Y.C. Deveshwar said.         
	The EIH-Max India combination is widely seen as a strategy to ward off cash-rich ITC, which has established its own hotel chain.        
	If ITC crosses 15 per cent, it has to make an open offer for another 20 per cent. However, given the shareholding pattern of EIH, ITC may not be able to corner more than 10-12 per cent.         
	An industry observer said ITC could even consider diluting its stake, considering the fact that it was already sitting on a hefty profit of over Rs 600 crore.         
	ITCs ambitions are in line with its strategy for inorganic growth, especially in luxury hotels.         
	At ITC Ltds 98th shareholders meeting this year, Deveshwar said that though he was not interested in hostile takeovers, he was looking for opportunities to acquire properties at reasonable prices in the downturn.         
	We are hungry we are willing, able and ready to make investments in two of our businesses  paper and hotels, he had said.        
	ITC could spend close to Rs 8,000 crore over the next 8-10 years to expand its hotel business, he had said.        
	According to sources, ITC had offered EIH chairman P.R.S. Oberoi a deal under which the company would take a controlling interest in EIH assets but would allow the latter to manage its current portfolio under the Oberoi and Trident brands.

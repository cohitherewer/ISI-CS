          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                            
	Mumbai, March 30: The Centre should dilute its majority stake in state-owned banks if it cant shovel cash into them and expand their capital base to meet the credit needs of a growing economy.        
	A panel formed by the Centre and the Reserve Bank of India today paved the road to financial sector reforms by suggesting a selective stake dilution in PSU banks and a relaxation in the rules governing the entry of foreign banks.         
	The Committee on Financial Sector Assessment, which was set up in 2006 to undertake a comprehensive health check-up on the countrys financial sector, said foreign banks should have the freedom to operate in the country either through branches or subsidiaries. The committee is headed by Rakesh Mohan, deputy governor of the RBI.        
	If a foreign bank chooses to establish a subsidiary, the report said the government should insist that the local entity lists on the local bourses.        
	At present, foreign banks operate in India through branches. The subsidiary route will give foreign banks greater freedom to open more branches in the country. But the flip side is that they will be required to conform to tough priority sector lending rules.        
	The report said banks would need more capital to implement Basel II guidelines and meet the credit requirements of an economy that was projected to grow at 8 per cent in the medium term. This could put pressure on nationalised banks, particularly those banks where the government shareholding is close to 51 per cent. The government has in the past shown its willingness to contribute capital.        
	However, if it is unable to do so, it will need to reduce its shareholding below 51 per cent which will require legislative changes.        
	Pending the enactment of such a legislation to reduce its majority ownership, the committee said one option the government could consider was to amalgamate banks where the government stake is close to 51 per cent with those in which the Centre holds significantly more than the stipulated minimum.        
	The committee observed that amalgamation should only be done if there were positive synergies and complementaries in the regional spread of the banks proposed to be merged.        
	The report said the RBIs approach on the roadmap for foreign banks was due for review after March 2009. The entry of foreign banks need to be gradual and consistent with overall financial policy strategy and the transition should happen smoothly without causing serious imbalance.        
	It noted that while reviewing the roadmap for entry of foreign banks, the RBI should see that branch licensing policy is broadly structured on the lines of that followed in new private sector banks.         
	However, licensing of foreign bank branches would continue to be based on the spirit of reciprocity by the corresponding regulator overseas.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                        
	New Delhi, Aug. 3: Exports fell 27.7 per cent in June  the ninth month running  because of recession.        
	Exports dropped to $12.8 billion in June from $17.73 billion a year ago. The fall was 29.2 per cent in May.         
	Ajay Sahai, the director-general of the Federation of Indian Export Organisations, said the declining trend was likely to continue for some more months.         
	The government should give incentives to exporters so that they did not lose orders.         
	The government should take short-term measures first and then come out with long-term policies after the global commerce shows improvement, Sahai said.        
	Imports, too, declined 29.3 per cent in June to $18.98 billion against $26.86 billion in the corresponding month of last year, official data showed.        
	Cumulative exports for the first quarter of this fiscal were down 31.3 per cent.        
	Trade policy meet        
	The Board of Trade, which has industrialists such as Anand Mahindra, Azim Premji and Y.C. Deveshwar as its members and is headed by commerce minister Anand Sharma, will meet next week to discuss the forthcoming foreign trade policy.

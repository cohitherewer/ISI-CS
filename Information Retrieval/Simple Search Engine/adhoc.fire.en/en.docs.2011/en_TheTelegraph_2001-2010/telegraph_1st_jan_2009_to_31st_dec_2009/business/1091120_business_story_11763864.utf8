          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              Raja, Mukherjee: Connection error				                                 
	New Delhi, Nov. 19: Telecom minister A. Raja was in the firing line today at a meeting of a group of ministers on the 3G spectrum impasse.         
	Finance minister Pranab Mukherjee, who chairs the group, was visibly annoyed with Raja, whom he suspected of inviting reporters to cover the meeting.        
	Mukherjee asked Raja why should anyone be briefing the media when it was decided that they should be kept away from the meeting. Raja tried to calm him by saying: I have not invited the media.         
	Sources said the ministers were unable to reach a consensus on the timeline for the vacation of spectrum by the defence forces.        
	Later in the day, the cabinet also discussed the issue. The cabinet discussed the issue, but I am not authorised to give any details, Ambika Soni, information and broadcasting minister, told reporters after the meeting, which was chaired by Prime Minister Manmohan Singh.         
	Besides Mukherjee, Raja and Soni, the telecom meeting was attended by defence minister A.K. Antony, home minister P. Chidambaram and law minister Veerappa Moily.        
	The defence and telecom ministries are at loggerheads over the vacation of spectrum by the former.         
	Defence occupies a bulk of spectrum for 3G, which lets users enjoy advanced services such as high-speed Internet and video conferencing on their mobiles. The defence ministry has pointed to the DoTs inability to provide an alternative fibre optic network as specified in a memorandum of understanding.        
	The MoU had stipulated that defence would release up to 45MHz of radio frequencies (spectrum) over a three-year period, of which 25 MHz would be for 3G and the rest for 2G.        
	The government plans to complete the auction for 3G services by the end of this fiscal. It is targeting Rs 35,000 crore from the auction to plug its fiscal deficit.

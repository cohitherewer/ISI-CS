The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Wake-up call for telecom newbies
                                                                                                               Wake-up call for telecom newbies
                            
	Barcelona, Feb. 18 (PTI): India today warned new players such as Unitech, Swan and Loop of action if they do not roll out services even though the delay on the part of some of them could be put down to working out tie-ups with foreign firms.        
	The governments stance may be a dampener because new players offer an opportunity to overseas entities to come to India, one of the fastest-growing markets in the world.        
	One year is coming to an end. It is time to ask the new players. We cannot allow them to hoard precious spectrum. It is required for use elsewhere, telecom secretary Siddartha Behura said.        
	Behura is here to attend the GSM Mobile World Congress and has met a number of foreign operators, vendors and other telecom players.        
	The department of telecom is planning to convene a meeting of all new operators who were given licence in January 2008 and were also allotted spectrum within a few months in a number of circles.        
	Communication and IT minister A. Raja has been facing charges of favouring new operators by giving them spectrum at Rs 1,651 crore for the entire country against the market price, which is several times greater.

          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Calcutta, July 28: McLeod Russel Indias first-quarter net profit jumped to Rs 31.18 crore from Rs 7.08 crore in the year-ago period.         
	The company sold 86 lakh kg of tea during the April-June quarter against 94 lakh kg in the same period last year.        
	The company is exploring opportunities to buy gardens with a capacity of 5-10 million kg in Kenya.        
	We are planning to acquire gardens abroad. In the next three to five years, 25-30 per cent of our total production should come from gardens outside India, McLeod Russel India managing director Aditya Khaitan said today.         
	McLeod Russel is the largest tea producer in the world.        
	Prices were higher by Rs 35 per kg compared with the year-ago period. This helped the company to register a higher profit, Khaitan said.

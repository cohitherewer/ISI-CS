          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                       Karnik: Upbeat                          
	Mumbai, Feb. 11: A road map for the revival of Satyam Computer Services  including a possible sale  is expected to be ready in the next 10 days, new chairman Kiran Karnik said.         
	He said he favoured selling Satyam as a single entity. The board will meet tomorrow here.         
	Though some have left, clients generally are not worried over the execution of contracts, he said.        
	Karnik refused to comment on the number of suitors as Satyam had not formally invited applications.         
	Investment bankers Goldman Sachs and Avendus are working on the sale procedures.        
	Satyam  which plunged into chaos following confessions of a fraud by founder B. Ramalinga Raju  was in a position to pay the salaries for February.        
	According to Karnik, the software firm will get the bank loans in the next few days.

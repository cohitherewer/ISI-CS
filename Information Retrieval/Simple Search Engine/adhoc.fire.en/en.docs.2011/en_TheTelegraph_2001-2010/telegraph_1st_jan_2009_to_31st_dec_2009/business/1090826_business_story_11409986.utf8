The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Bharti-MTN pact to throw up deal clue
                                                                                                               Bharti-MTN pact to throw up deal clue
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                          Clear Signal                                  
	New Delhi, Aug. 25: Bharti Airtel and South Africas MTN are likely to sign a framework agreement by the end of this week.        
	The indicative framework agreement would give greater clarity to both investors and regulators on the proposed $23-billion deal, which would create the worlds third-largest mobile operator.         
	Sources said the new framework could reveal an increase in the cash component, without changing the overall value of the deal.         
	The cash component can be increased by 10-15 per cent to about $6 billion compared with the originally estimated $4 billion, by reducing the share of global depository receipts, said sources. However, Bharti has been maintaining that there is no question of sweetening the deal.        
	Though some Bharti shareholders had moved Sebi against the deal, sources said the two firms were close to an understanding. The Bharti shareholders are demanding an open offer by MTN. The Securities Appellate Tribunal will be hearing on August 28 an appeal by a shareholder for clarity on a Sebi order that exempts MTN from an open offer, if a merger happens, provided it does not convert its Bharti GDRs into equity.        
	Analysts are also optimistic about the deal getting a seal of approval before the exclusivity period expires next month. It is very clear both for MTN and Bharti where their next markets are. Both Africa and India hold 33 per cent of the worlds population and both these markets have 40 per cent penetration, allowing for a lot of opportunity, said Romal Shetty, telecom analyst at KPMG.

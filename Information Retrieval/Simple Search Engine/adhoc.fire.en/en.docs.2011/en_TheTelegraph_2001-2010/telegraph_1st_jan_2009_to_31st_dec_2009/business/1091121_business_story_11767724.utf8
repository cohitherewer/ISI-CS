The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Britannia in truce mood
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Britannia in truce mood
          SOUNAK MITRA                          Peace move                                  
	Calcutta, Nov. 20: Britannia Industries, which moved Alipore Judges Court against an eviction order from the Calcutta Port Trust (CPT), is now planning to settle the dispute with the CPT.        
	The matter will be dealt with by the due date, a company spokesperson told The Telegraph.         
	On October 30, the court had ruled that prior to any hearing on a stay against the eviction, Britannia must pay Rs 6.63 crore to the CPT within a month.        
	The next hearing will take place on December 1, a highly placed source said. Till the next hearing, the CPT is unlikely to take any action, he said.         
	However, Britannia has not communicated with the CPT after the ruling.        
	On October 15, the estate officer of the Calcutta Port Trust had served a notice of eviction to Britannia from its factory at Taratala.         
	Britannia Industries of 15 Taratala Road, Calcutta 700088 and all persons who may be in occupation of the same premises or any part thereof to vacate the premises within 15 days of the date of publication of this order, the notice said.        
	The CPT, which owns the land, had asked Britannia to pay Rs 13 crore towards rent and penalty.         
	Britannia and all other persons concerned are liable to be evicted from the said premises, if need be, by the use of such force as may be necessary, the notice added.        
	Britannia has already informed its workmen that the company was planning to relocate its sales team from Taratala.

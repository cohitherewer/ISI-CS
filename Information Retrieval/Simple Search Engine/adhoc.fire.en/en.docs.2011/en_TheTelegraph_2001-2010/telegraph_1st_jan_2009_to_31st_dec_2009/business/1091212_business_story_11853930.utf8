                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Status quo on Marico price
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Calcutta, Dec. 11: Harsh Mariwala-led Marico Ltd today said it would not raise the prices of its products.        
	We are seeing a marginal increase in the prices of inputs such as copra and safflower oil from October. But this is not going to impact our prices as of now, chairman Harsh Mariwala said on the sidelines of a Ficci programme here today.        
	Marico is also in the race, along with Godrej Consumer Products, for British skin care brand Simple. Simple, one of the largest beauty brands in the UK, was recently put on the block by promoter Duke Street Capital, a British private equity group. The brand value of Simple is around $250 million.        
	Earlier this financial year, Marico sold its wholly owned subsidiary Sundari LLC as the company was not doing well. The deal value was not revealed.         
	Sundari LLC was formed in February 2003 as a joint venture between Marico Ltd and New York-based Shanthil LLC, the owner of the Sundari line of luxury ayurvedic cosmetics in the US. Marico acquired a 63 per cent stake and its affiliate Adil amp; Associates had 7.5 per cent equity. Shanthil LLC has a 24.5 per cent stake and private investors hold the rest. Sundari became a wholly owned subsidiary of Marico in late 2007.

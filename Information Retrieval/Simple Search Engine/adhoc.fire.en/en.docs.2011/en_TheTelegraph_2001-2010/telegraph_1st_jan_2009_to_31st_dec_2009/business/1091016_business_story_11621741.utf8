The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Coal prices go up 11%
                                                                                                               Coal prices go up 11%
                            
	Calcutta, Oct. 15 (PTI): State-owned Coal India Ltd today raised prices by an average 11 per cent, which will increase the input cost of the user industries, especially steel and power.        
	Coal prices will be hiked 11 per cent midnight today, Coal India director (technical) N.C. Jha said.         
	The PSU had last revised prices in December 2007. The basic price of coal from Eastern Coalfields and Bharat Coking Coal has been raised 15 per cent and its other subsidiary firms by 10 per cent.         
	Eastern Coalfields was authorised to set a special price for its high quality A and B grades of Ranigunj coal, available in limited quantities, at a level commensurate with imported rates. After revision, Coal Indias prices will be in the range of Rs 448 per tonne to Rs 2,500 per tonne.         
	Coal India has been seeking a price hike as its profitability got eroded because of a wage and salary revision and an increase in input cost.        
	Its profit before tax dipped 20 per cent in the first half of the current fiscal to Rs 3,600 crore from Rs 4,484 crore a year ago.

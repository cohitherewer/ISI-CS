                                                                                                               Patel taps PM for AI equity
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                    
	New Delhi, Aug. 8: Civil aviation minister Praful Patel today met Prime Minister Manmohan Singh to seek his help for an equity infusion into ailing state-run carrier Air India. Patel also promised to make a detailed presentation before the cabinet on the demands of the airline industry  lower jet fuel taxes, credit from state-run oil companies and reduced airport charges.        
	Sources said the civil aviation ministry was lobbying for an equity infusion of Rs 2,000-2,500 crore into Air India, a demand which the Prime Minister supported.         
	The finance ministry had earlier been toying with an infusion of Rs 1,250 crore, which was Air Indias original demand.         
	Air India, which has accumulated losses of Rs 7,200 crore, is also seeking a government guarantee to retire high-cost debts, which account for around Rs 11,000 crore of its Rs 16,000-crore debt portfolio, and replace it with cheaper credit. Banks have sought a sovereign guarantee to reduce interest rates.        
	The Prime Minister was supportive of fresh equity in Air India, an official spokesperson for the civil aviation ministry said after the hour-long meeting at South Block here.         
	He was also briefed about the new Air India board. The minister will make a detailed presentation before the cabinet next Thursday. An early decision can be expected, she said.        
	Yesterday, the national carrier had unveiled plans to turn around in 24-36 months by shifting more flights to AI Express, spinning off cargo, ground handling and engineering into separate firms or joint ventures, restructuring its debt and taking fresh capital from the government.        
	Officials said Patel would request the cabinet for lowering jet fuel prices, which could only be brought about through tax cuts.         
	The aviation industry had been demanding a declared goods status for jet fuel which could reduce the value-added tax from as high as 29 per cent in some states to just 4 per cent across the country.

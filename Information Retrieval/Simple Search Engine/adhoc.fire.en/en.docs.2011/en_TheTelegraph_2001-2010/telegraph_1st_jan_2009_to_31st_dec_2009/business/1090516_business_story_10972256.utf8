The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Sensex shrugs off worries, surges
                                                                                                               Sensex shrugs off worries, surges
          OUR BUREAU                                            
	Mumbai, May 15: The sensex surged 2.5 per cent on Friday  the 10th successive week that it recorded a gain  underscoring the fact that the market was no longer spooked by the outcome of the closely-fought general election.        
	This is the longest winning streak for stocks in almost three years and it meant that the market had exorcised the ghost of 2004 when the bellwether index tumbled over 11 per cent three days after the election results.        
	The market was bolstered by the hope that one of the two main coalitions  the UPA or the NDA  would be able to form the next government without having to rely on the Left for support.        
	The biggest relief for the market was the poll projections which showed that the Lefts strength in Parliament would be greatly diminished from the 61 seats it had in the 14th Lok Sabha and, therefore, unlikely to be in a position to impede the pace of reforms.        
	The chances of the third front coming to power are very low and one of the two main political parties will be invited to form the government. There is a lot of pent-up demand for stocks ahead of the big event, said Manish Sonthalia, fund manager at Motilal Oswal.        
	Back in 2004, the Left had sparked one of the biggest post-election slides after its leaders said they would stall the privatisation of public sector units and demanded the scrapping of the divestment ministry.        
	On May 17, 2004, the sensex fell 11.14 per cent to 4505.16 from 5069.87 on May 14 (the previous trading day) because that comment triggered an avalanche of selling by the foreign institutional investors.        
	This time the exit polls indicate that the Left is weak and the BSP is not doing well. The outlook is not bleak and a lot of people are sitting on cash, said Vijay Bhatia, country head (private clients group) at India Infoline.        
	The market had fallen over 2 per cent in the past two sessions as investors were spooked by the prospect of a weak coalition that wouldnt be able to take bold measures to re-ignite a stuttering economy and trim the burgeoning fiscal deficit.        
	The 30-share BSE index rose 2.53 per cent, or 300.51 points, to 12173.42, its best close in more than seven months.        
	ICICI Bank, Reliance Industries and Bharti Airtel led the gains.        
	The market has soared more than 50 per cent from the years low in March as foreign funds pumped in more than $1.8 billion in April. The sensex has risen 26 per cent this year after plunging by more than half in 2008.        
	The 50-share NSE index ended the day up 2.2 per cent at 3,671.65 points.        
	Foreign gains        
	The majority of Indian shares listed on the American bourses made significant gains in early trade today, with ICICI Bank soaring as much as 7 per cent.        
	Most of the 16 Indian stocks trading as American Depository Receipts were trading in the green.        
	Apart from ICICI Bank, the shares of HDFC Bank, IT majors Infosys and Wipro, and auto maker Tata Motors were also in the positive territory.        
	ICICI surged 7 per cent to $23.87, while HDFC Bank jumped 4.14 per cent to $79.99. Wipro gained 5 per cent to $10.90, Infosys rose 2 per cent to $32.13 and Tata Motors increased 2.5 per cent to $7.67.        
	Dr Reddys was trading flat at $11.57.

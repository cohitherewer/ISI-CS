        Entry load on MFs has been scrapped. It remains to be seen how it benefits investors, says Srikumar Bondyopadhyay                                            
	If the carrot doesnt work, the stick might. Thats how market regulator Sebi wants to put the mutual fund industry in order.         
	From next month, mutual funds have been barred from charging entry load on their schemes and using more than 1 per cent exit load to pay commissions to distributors and agents.         
	Till now, mutual funds have been wooing distributors with high commissions to sell their new fund offers (NFOs) to increase their asset under management (AUM).         
	Fund houses though were not paying these commissions from their own pockets. Instead, the money was collected from the entry and exit loads investors paid and the recurring expenses fund houses deducted from the AUM of a scheme.         
	No entry fee        
	Last month, Sebi scrapped the entry load on mutual funds bought on or after August 1, 2009. Instead, investors themselves would have to pay the upfront commission directly to the distributor, based on a bilateral negotiation.        
	However, mutual funds still can pay commissions to the distributors, either from the exit load or from their own kitty. But, mutual funds cannot keep aside more than 1 per cent to pay for commissions.        
	Anything over and above a 1 per cent exit load will have to be immediately credited to the fund under management of the scheme.        
	What this means for investors is that they will now have to write two cheques instead of one for any fresh investment on or after August 1  one to the asset management company (AMC) and the other to the agent or the distributor.         
	Thus, the entire amount given to the AMC will be invested.         
	Investor interest        
	Investors will benefit because AMCs can no longer keep aside more than 1 per cent exit load. If a fund charges more than 1 per cent exit load, the AMC will have to credit the excess exit load charged to the scheme and this will increase the schemes net asset value.        
	The Sebi circular aims to bring in transparency in the payment of commission and clamp down on mis-selling of products by distributors and agents. It also puts more responsibility on investors and makes them pay for the services rendered by the agents.        
	If you want the distributor/agent to analyse a fund and advise you on the investment options available, you may have to pay a fee higher than the entry load you are paying now. You can also seek the help of the agent to work out your financial planning or receive inputs on when to switch from one scheme to another, all at a higher cost.        
	In this way, the Sebi move can increase awareness and financial literacy among investors as well as sharpen the advisory skills of the distributors and agents.         
	When an investor pays the commission from his own pocket, he will automatically be eager to know about the product and pay heed to the arguments in favour of the services rendered by the distributor. Distributors, too, cant charge a higher commission without providing value-added services.         
	Intermediaries often take advantage of investors ignorance and sell wrong products.        
	For example, take the case of buying a unit-linked insurance plan (Ulip). A Ulip is similar to a mutual fund and the only difference between the two is that the former has an insurance component, while the latter doesnt.         
	However, a Ulip investor hardly considers that an up-front commission between 20 per cent and 40 per cent is deducted from his first premium. This is because the insurer pays the commission to the agent selling the policy.         
	It is natural that the insurance agent will be inclined to sell those policies where he will get the maximum commission. Mutual fund agents are no different. They push only those funds that fetch them higher commissions. This practice has so far been prevalent in new fund offers.         
	Fund houses have been resorting to launching schemes in their bid to increase their AUM. Investors flocked to the NFOs lured by the opportunity of getting units at face value without paying any attention to the fundamentals of a fund. They ended up investing in funds that didnt have any proven track record, thereby taking undue risks on investments.        
	At present, mutual funds charge a small or no entry load in debt schemes.         
	In equity schemes, too, investments above Rs 5 crore dont attract any entry load.         
	Its only investments below Rs 2 crore in equity schemes that attract an entry load of 2.25 per cent.         
	Investors dont have to pay any entry load even now if they buy units directly from the fund houses. But, direct sales comprise less than 5 per cent of total sales of AMCs.        
	It remains to be seen the extent to which Sebis revised norms of doing away with the entry load and paying the commission directly to the distributor/agent empower retail investors. A lot depends on investors becoming more aware and financially literate.         
	One thing is certain. For fund houses, it could well be the last hurrah of NFOs before the August 1 deadline arrives.         
	From next month, the business of selling funds will be in a flux for a while.         
	Mutual funds will definitely be working on different distribution strategies, such as opening up more branches, better logistics, banking on technology by introducing online applications and reaching out to investors through text messages and offering redemption facilities.

          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Calcutta, Sept. 21: Digital imaging equipment maker Nikon aims to grow at the rate of 30-35 per cent over the next 1-2 years in India.        
	We aim to have a 45 per cent market share in digital SLR space and 10 per cent in the compact segment in India, Nikon India managing director Hidehiko Tanaka said here today.         
	At present, Nikon has a 37 per cent market share in the digital SLR segment and eight per cent in the compact digital camera business.        
	The size of the SLR camera market is very small ... of around 17,000 units this year. We will create awareness about SLR cameras through seminars and other activities, he said.        
	Nikon, which has 800 outlets in India, will add 400 by the end of the year.         
	We will also open our third office-cum-service centre in the southern part of the country this year, Tanaka said.         
	The company has offices in Mumbai and Calcutta.        
	Nikon, which recently launched two digital SLR cameras  D3000 and D300s  said it would launch around four compact cameras this year and four SLRs in the country.        
	Tanaka said Nikon had outsourced the software programme to an Indian company and had already started shipping cameras with the Indian-made software.         
	However, he refused to divulge the name of the company.

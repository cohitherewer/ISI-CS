	Calcutta, June 18: Indian firms are more conscious of the need for energy efficiency than their western counterparts, according to a survey.        
	Business leaders in India are becoming increasingly aware of the need for energy efficiency and the impact this can have on reducing operating costs, said Pramoda Karkal, vice-president and managing director (building efficiency) of Johnson Controls India. The company recently conducted an Energy Efficiency Indicator survey in India and North America.        
	An almost similar percentage of respondents (India: 94 per cent, North America: 93 per cent) considered making energy efficiency a priority for new constructions and renovations. However, in India, 18 per cent of the respondents were investing in energy efficient means compared with 7 per cent in North America.

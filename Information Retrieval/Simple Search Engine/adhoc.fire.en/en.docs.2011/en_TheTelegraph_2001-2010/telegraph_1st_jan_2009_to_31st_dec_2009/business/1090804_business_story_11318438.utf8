                                                                                                               Bharti, MTN agree to stretch talktime
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                                            
	New Delhi, Aug. 3: Bharti Airtel and South Africas MTN today extended the deadline for their exclusive merger talks till August-end. If successful, the deal will create the worlds third-largest mobile-phone operator.         
	While resuming their merger talks on May 25  the talks had fizzled out last year  the duo had set a two-month period for exclusive discussions till July 31.        
	The extension of the deadline by a month to August 31 indicates that both the companies are thrashing out all complex issues and are keen on finalising their strategic alliance soon.         
	A joint statement by the duo says that as discussions between the parties regarding the potential transaction are continuing, both parties have agreed to extend the exclusivity period up to August 31, 2009.         
	Analysts say the extension indicates that Bharti may sweeten the deal for MTN shareholders.         
	In the official statement, Bharti and MTN said the structure and terms of the potential transaction might be adjusted to reflect further discussions between the parties.         
	No decisions or agreement to acquire any shares or implement the transactions outlined above have been made by the boards of either Bharti or MTN and the discussions may or may not lead to any transaction. The structure and terms of the potential transaction may be adjusted to reflect further discussions between the parties, the statement said.         
	According to Sanjay Chawla, a sector analyst at Anand Rathi Securities, This is the first clear indication from Bharti that the price can be increased and the deal may not be in the same form.         
	Harit Shah, telecom analyst at Angel Broking, said, Though it is still early to comment on the structure of the deal, Bharti may have to sweeten the deal.         
	An analyst from another brokerage, who does not wish to be identified, said Bharti might have to shell out more cash or offer more equity to MTN Group.        
	Worried about Bharti paying more resulted in the scrip coming off its highs on the stock exchanges today.         
	The Bhati scrip ended at Rs 411.10 on the Bombay Stock Exchange today after rising to an intra-day high of Rs 417.40.        
	Many MTN shareholders, including South Africas state pension fund Public Investment Corp, which holds the most shares in the company, had said that there was room for an improvement in the price.         
	The deal envisages Bharti holding 49 per cent in MTN and the latter owning a 36 per cent interest in the Indian company.

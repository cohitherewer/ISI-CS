The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | ONGC goes slow in Nigeria 
                                                                                                               ONGC goes slow in Nigeria 
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Deal drill                                  
	New Delhi, May 3: Oil and Natural Gas Corporation has sought greater clarity from the Nigerian government vis--vis its rights over oil blocks 321 and 323 that were previously with Korean National Oil Corporation (KNOC).         
	Nigeria has offered the blocks to ONGC Videsh, the overseas arm of ONGC, after current stakeholder KNOC failed to pay $231 million of the $323 million it had promised while signing the contract.        
	However, ONGC may find it tough getting the two oil blocks as a local court has restrained the Nigerian government from cancelling the Korean firms exploration rights.        
	Company sources confirmed that ONGC had received a letter from the Nigerian energy ministry offering the blocks. However, the Indian firm has asked the Nigerian government to give a copy of the contract signed by KNOC for the two blocks along with the details of the order cancelling the deal.        
	ONGC Videsh, which has a presence in 18 foreign countries, has also sought more time to decide on the takeover of the two deep-sea oil blocks. The company may have to wait till the general elections in India to get approval for its $291m investment in the oil blocks.        
	In August 2005, ONGC had won blocks 321 and 323 after committing an investment of $485 million. However, Nigeria awarded the blocks to KNOC, claiming that the Korean firm had the first right of refusal.        
	The government has now announced that it has scrapped the Korean contract but is yet to formally withdraw the agreement.        
	ONGC Videsh wants to see the formal cancellation order before shelling out $291 million for a 60 per cent interest in the two blocks.        
	The blocks in the southwest coast of Nigeria are estimated to hold reserves of over 2 billion barrels each.        
	KNOC had signed the production sharing contracts for the blocks in January 2006 but paid only $92 million signature bonus, forcing the government to cancel the allocation.        
	The South Korean firm had also promised to build a 1,200km gas pipeline from the southern delta to the capital Abuja and a 2,250MW power plant. But it has made no progress on these fronts.        
	Nigeria is Africas biggest oil producer and the worlds eighth largest exporter producing 2.4 million barrels per day.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Esop rule takes shine off FBT relief 
                                                                                                               Esop rule takes shine off FBT relief 
										      GUEST COLUMN - RAHUL MITRA                        
	The budget has proceeded on the path of caution in matters of corporate income taxes, instead of resorting to strategic reforms, which perhaps have been held back for the new tax code, proposed to be released in the next 45 days.        
	The most positive move on the part of the government was to abolish FBT, which the industry looked upon as perhaps a cost of doing business in India, rather than achieving any definite purpose. However, while FBT has been abolished on Esops, the same would now be taxed as perquisites in the hands of employees at the time of the exercise of option. This is contrary to the pre-FBT position, where capital gains tax was levied at the time of the sale of Esop shares, while there was no perquisite taxation at the time of the exercise of Esops.        
	The extension of STPI (Software Technology Parks of India) and EOU holidays by one year should also incentivise the IT industry in the midst of the global slowdown.        
	The government has authorised the CBDT to introduce safe-harbour rules in matters of transfer pricing with a view to minimise tax disputes.         
	It is likely that the CBDT might introduce such rules in case of IT and ITeS companies, which are subsidiaries of foreign MNCs, operating in India as captive contract service providers under cost plus models, by specifying figures of mark-ups, which, if adhered to, should exonerate them for challenges in transfer pricing, a la Maquiladoras (contract manufacturers) in Mexico and non-core service providers/ recipients in Australia, where similar safe-harbour provisions are prevalent.        
	While on transfer pricing, the introduction of a panel for alternate dispute resolution, merely replaces the forum of the appellate commissioner by such panel. In the end, the panel continues to do a post mortem of transactions after three years of execution thereof, while the need of the hour was the introduction of advance pricing agreements in matters relating to transfer pricing, which would have provided significant comfort and relief to taxpayers in having an upfront ruling on their transfer pricing matters, instead of having to wait for three to four years for a verdict from the revenue authorities.        
	While further deliberating on transfer pricing, the government has sought to nullify the rulings of tribunals given in the context of the (+)/(-) 5 per cent range around the arithmetic mean, while determining arms length prices.

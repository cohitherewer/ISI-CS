          OUR BUREAU AND PTI                              
	New Delhi, Dec. 22: The Centre today constituted a committee of industry ministers of seven states to prepare guidelines for land banks to meet the need of industry.        
	The move assumes significance especially at a time when the chorus for a transparent land acquisition strategy is getting louder.        
	However, the committee has no representation from Orissa and Bengal, where land acquisition for private projects has raised a storm in the past two years.        
	Bengal and Orissa did not attend the meeting called by the Department of Industrial Policy and Promotion here on November 17 to prepare a road map for accelerating industrial growth and investment.        
	Industry ministers from Andhra Pradesh, Maharashtra, Assam, Haryana, Madhya Pradesh, Punjab and Rajasthan are in the committee that will also find a way to simplify the procedures for different clearances.        
	As far as possible, waste and fallow plots, plus the sites locked in sick and defunct industrial units should be utilised for creating the land pool, the DIPP said in the terms of reference for the committee.        
	The panel, a follow-up of the meeting of the industry ministers last month, will also prepare a framework for state-specific investment promotion strategies and a state-level skill development plan.        
	During last months meeting, commerce minister Anand Sharma had said that states could play a crucial role in taking industrial development to the next level.         
	Korean steel giant Poscos around Rs 54,000-crore project in Orissa  the largest FDI in the country  is yet to start because of land problems, though the MoU with the state government was signed way back in 2005.         
	Worlds biggest steel maker ArcelorMittals around Rs 1 lakh crore projects in Orissa and Jharkhand are also facing the same fate. While it signed the MoU with Jharkhand in 2005, for the Orissa plant the agreement was signed in 2006. Both Posco and Mittal have evinced interest in setting up facilities in Karnataka.

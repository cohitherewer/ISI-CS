          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Calcutta, Jan. 6: Tata Steel has suffered a 14 per cent drop in sales during the third quarter of this fiscal.        
	The company sold 1.07 million tonnes of steel between October and December this fiscal.        
	However, the production of hot metal at 1.70 million tonnes and crude steel at 1.50 million tonnes was higher by 23 per cent and 17 per cent, respectively, compared with volumes in the year-ago quarter.        
	Saleable steel production remained flat during the quarter compared with last year, indicating that the company may have more than usual inventory.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Iron ore royalty set to rise
                                                                                                               Iron ore royalty set to rise
          JAYANTA ROY CHOWDHURY                                             
	New Delhi, Aug. 9: The Congress-led government is increasing the royalties on non-coal minerals, including iron ore, to 10 per cent, under pressure from mineral-rich states such as Orissa, Jharkhand, Karnataka and Rajasthan.         
	The royalty earnings of states can, therefore, go up four to six-fold. Till now, a fixed, or a specific, duty is being charged on these minerals; if the Union cabinet agrees to a note circulated by the ministry of mines, the duty can go up to 10 per cent on an ad valorem basis.         
	Ad valorem duties are on the cost, or the market value, of articles, while specific duties are a fixed levy without reference to an articles value.         
	Royalties, on a per-tonne basis, have not been revised since October 2004, while the prices of minerals have gone up many times.         
	State governments, therefore, are unhappy with the small sum they are earning compared with the huge profits of the mining companies.         
	The centre is supposed to review royalty rates every three years, and it is pending since 2007.         
	A study group of the mines ministry with representatives from Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand, Karnataka, Orissa, Rajasthan, among others, has submitted a report favouring a shift to an ad valorem duty regime.         
	Orissa chief minister Naveen Patnaik in a meeting with Prime Minister Manmohan Singh last week had even lobbied for a hike to a 20 per cent levy.        
	State such as Orissa argue that they need to get a greater share of the mining companies profit for local development. The companies, the states say, do not spend adequately on the development of the local regions, which are very backward and Maoist strongholds.         
	Besides, the states are peeved at the Centre for not passing on a portion of a levy on mineral export.        
	Sources said the issue had come up before the cabinet committee on economic affairs, and a final decision would be made soon after Prime Minister Manmohan Singh takes a view.         
	Currently, the royalty on iron ore varies from Rs 11 a tonne to Rs 27 a tonne depending on the quality of the ore.         
	Karnataka, which mines about 35 million tonnes of iron ore every year worth about Rs 6,500 crore, earns a mere Rs 165 crore as royalties.         
	However, the mineral firms arent happy at the prospect of having to pay such large sums. Big mining companies as well as steel makers who do not have their own mines are up in arms against the move as it cuts into their huge profit margins. R.K. Sharma, secretary-general of the Federation of Indian Mineral Industries said, This could push up costs and ultimately affect the inflation rate.         
	However, most ministries seem to support the case for a shift to an ad valorem duty, which is fairer to the owner of the minerals  the states. Iron ore prices impact the wholesale price index and the price of several manufactures.

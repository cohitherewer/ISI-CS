          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Mumbai, June 19: The State Bank of India today announced its plan to acquire the State Bank of Indore, an associate bank.        
	The central board of the bank, at its meeting held on June 19, approved a proposal for the acquisition of the State Bank of Indore by the SBI, subject to the approval from the Reserve Bank and the government, the countrys largest bank informed the stock exchanges today. It carefully avoided using the word merger.        
	However, market circles believe that the SBI will merge the State Bank of Indore with itself. If it is successful in doing so, this will be the second merger within the State Bank group. Last year, the SBI merged the State Bank of Saurashtra with itself.        
	The SBI now has six associate banks. These include the State Bank of Bikaner amp; Jaipur, State Bank of Hyderabad, State Bank of Mysore, State Bank of Indore, State Bank of Patiala, and the State Bank of Travancore.        
	Although the SBI has been keen on merging them with itself because of a myriad benefits that will accrue, the proposal has not found favour with its employees and officers unions which fear retrenchments.        
	The announcement comes days after finance minister Pranab Mukherjee expressed his support for a merger among nationalised banks. At his meeting with the heads of PSU banks on June 10, Mukherjee said the Centre would support bank mergers only when both the parties agreed to such a consolidation and employees were taken into confidence.

                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Sharma maintains firm stand at WTO
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Dec. 3: India today said it had not changed its stand on agriculture and industry at the WTO negotiations as it continued to give top priority to the interests of its farmers and small enterprises.        
	There was no change in Indias negotiating position in agriculture and non-agriculture market access (Nama), an official release said quoting commerce minister Anand Sharma.        
	The minister led the India delegation at the three-day WTO ministerial conference in Geneva and attended by the trade ministers of 153 member countries. The meet ended on Wednesday.        
	Ministers reaffirmed the need to conclude the Doha round in 2010 and a stock taking will take place in the first quarter of next year, conference chair and Chiles economy minister Andres Velasco said while summing up the meeting.        
	There was support for asking senior officials to continue to work to map the road towards that point. Gaps remain on substance and there was wide acknowledgment of the need for leadership and engagement on the remaining specific issues over the coming weeks, said a WTO release quoting Velasco.        
	India has been pressing for an effective safeguard mechanism to protect its farmers and small-scale sector from any surge in imports after the liberalisation of world trade.        
	At a news conference, Sharma said the meeting provided a useful opportunity for different groups and caucuses to assess the direction of the negotiations.         
	The minister said the first priority should be to conclude as quickly as possible the Doha round of talks on liberalising world trade, which had started eight years ago.

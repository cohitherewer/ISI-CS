The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Cipla, Pfizer in supply talks
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Cipla, Pfizer in supply talks
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                            
	Mumbai, Dec. 1: Cipla has opened discussions with Pfizer Inc  the worlds largest pharmaceutical company by sales  and a few other global giants to supply off-patent drugs.        
	The Cipla-Pfizer talks are part of a growing trend triggered by global drug companies that have started farming out production of generic drugs to Indian firms as they struggle to pare costs and make affordable drugs available around the world.        
	Pfizer hopes to use Ciplas manufacturing facilities in India to make select drugs that it will market overseas.        
	Pfizer Inc did not comment on the prospective alliance but Amar Lulla, joint managing director of Cipla, confirmed that the company was looking at such a partnership.        
	Cipla has always followed a model of partnership and alliances in marketing its products, particularly overseas. Cipla is in talks with a number of multinationals to develop products, regulatory packages and ultimately supply them from its world class facilities. Pfizer is one such company with whom Cipla is in dialogue, Lulla said.        
	The buzz in the market is that the arrangement will cover therapeutic categories such as oncology and respiratory illnesses. Speculation swirled that Pfizer could also pick up a stake in Cipla but this was immediately squelched by sources close to the Indian company.        
	Talk of the alliance sparked a rally in Cipla shares. On the Bombay Stock Exchange, the scrip gained 2.67 per cent to close at Rs 328.70.        
	Sarabjit Kour Nangra, vice-president (research) at Angel Broking, said an alliance would boost immediately Ciplas revenues.        
	India is, however, not new to such alliances. In March, Hyderabad-based Aurobindo Pharma inked an agreement with Pfizer Inc.        
	Under that agreement, Aurobindo Pharma will manufacture several off-patented or loss of exclusivity products that will be marketed by Pfizers established product business unit.        
	Under the terms of the original deal, Pfizer was to sell 39 drugs in the US, 20 in Europe, including 11 in France.        
	The scope of the pact was later expanded in May when Pfizer acquired rights to 55 solid oral dose products and five sterile injectable products for various countries in Asia, Latin America, Africa and West Asia.         
	The products came under therapeutic segments such as anti-infectives, cardiovascular and central nervous system disorders.        
	Later in June, GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) clinched an agreement with Dr Reddys Laboratories Ltd (DRL) to develop and market selected products across a number of emerging markets, excluding India.        
	Under this agreement, GSK will gain exclusive access to DRLs existing portfolio and future pipeline of more than 100 branded pharmaceuticals in various therapeutic segments.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Social costs weigh on tea firms
                                                                                                               Social costs weigh on tea firms
          SOUNAK MITRA                          Bitter brew                                  
	Calcutta, Oct. 4: Tea firms are feeling the pinch of rising expenses on security of estates and welfare benefits of workers. Efforts to rope in the central and state governments to share these social costs have met with little success.         
	Small growers as well as big companies such as McLeod Russel, Assam Tea, Apeejay and Warren are affected.         
	According to a study by the Indian Tea Association (ITA), the cost of production of tea in India is the highest in the world. Welfare costs, which account for bulk of the social expenses, work out to over Rs 7 per kg. These are not visible in many of our competing nations, said ITA chairman Aditya Khaitan, who is also the managing director of McLeod Russel.         
	Companies have to shell out another Rs 1.50 per kg for security. Planters also provide foodgrains and other facilities to estate workers at concessional rates.        
	Security is always an issue. Though the situation is much better now, the threat of insurgents still looms large. We have beefed up security, said a planter. The annual expenditure on security is estimated at around Rs 16 crore, an ITA data showed.         
	At a recent ITA meet, commerce minister Anand Sharma had said a ministerial panel had been formed to look into the problems faced by planters and come out with specific recommendations.         
	India remains an important producer of tea, which contributes 28 per cent of the global production. Our aim is to maintain that position in the years to come. We would also consider the industrys demand to share the burden of social costs, Sharma said at the meeting.         
	Higher internal consumption has pushed up tea prices to Rs 133.8 per kg in the January-July period from Rs 106.27 per kg in the year-ago period.        
	According to the recommendations of an inter-ministerial committee set up by the labour ministry in 2003, planters are supposed to bear 50 per cent of the social costs with the central government contributing 40 per cent and state governments 10 per cent.        
	Earlier this month, the United Planters Association of Southern India (Upasi) had also expressed concern over high social costs.         
	There is an urgent need to overhaul the Plantations Act, the Land Reforms Act and the Minimum Wages Act to become competitive in a global market, said Upasi president D.P. Maheshwari, who is also the managing director of Jay Shree Tea amp; Industries.

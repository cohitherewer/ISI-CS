The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Nasscom sees more BPO jobs
                                                                                                               Nasscom sees more BPO jobs
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Bangalore, June 9: Indian BPO firms will hire more this year amid a global recession but need to explore new revenue streams to beat mounting competition from rivals in other nations, according to Nasscom.        
	The industry is faced with multiple challenges, including a decline in sourcing spend, price reductions, competition from other countries and protectionism, Nasscom chairman Pramod Bhasin said at a BPO meet here.         
	Tapping industries such as manufacturing, health care and retail, expansion into new geographies and greater domestic market growth would be critical, he said. Indian BPOs grew at a compounded annual rate of over 37 per cent to generate revenues of $14.7 billion in 2008-2009 from $1.6 billion in 2002-03, a Nasscom statement said.         
	A bulk of the revenue is from the US in banking, financial services and insurance  all now reeling under the economic crisis. New verticals such as the public sector and health care, and markets such as Brazil, Russia, China and India will drive growth over the next decade, according to Nasscoms Perspective Report 2020. The BPO industry employs around 9.8 lakh people. Nasscom president Som Mittal warned of growing competition from countries such as Philippines, China, Vietnam, Brazil and Egypt

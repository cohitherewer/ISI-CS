The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Focus on Reliance family pact
                                                                                                               Focus on Reliance family pact
          OUR BUREAU                              
	New Delhi, Oct. 22: Reliance Industries today said it had no knowledge of the pact between its chairman Mukesh Ambani and his younger brother Anil, but the Supreme Court wanted to know how a division (of the Reliance empire between the Ambani brothers) took place if there was no pact.        
	If there was no memorandum of understanding (MoU) or any arrangement, then there was no division. What was the need for a demerger of a well-known oil company (RIL)? the three-judge bench headed by Chief Justice K.G. Balakrishnan asked RIL counsel Harish Salve.        
	On the third day of hearing on the gas supply dispute between the group firms of the Ambani brothers, Justice R.V. Raveendran asked RIL to satisfy the bench that the MoU, signed in 2005, was not between two companies, but two individuals.        
	Salve said the RIL board had no knowledge of the pact, which was not produced before the shareholders, adding that it would be a dangerous trend if promoters are allowed to have side-deals. Secret agreements between promoters which affect the companys shareholders are not binding on the company, especially one that has three million shareholders, he said.         
	The bench also enquired if the pact, which has not been made public till date, could be produced before the court.

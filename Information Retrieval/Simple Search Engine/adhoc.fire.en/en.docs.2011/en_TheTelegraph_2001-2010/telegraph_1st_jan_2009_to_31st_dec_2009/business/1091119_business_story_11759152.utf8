	Calcutta, Nov. 18: Axis Mutual Fund  the wholly owned subsidiary of Axis Bank  is planning to float its first offshore fund in the next six to eight months.        
	We are working to set up an offshore vehicle to launch the fund sometime in the second quarter of next year, said Rajiv Anand, managing director and CEO, Axis Asset Management Company Ltd.        
	An offshore fund is a collective investment plan similar to a mutual fund but domiciled in an offshore financial centre to facilitate investments by expatriates and foreigners in India.         
	According to Chandresh Nigam, head (equity) of Axis Mutual Fund, the company is looking to provide fund management advisory services through the offshore vehicle.        
	The company also plans to launch its portfolio management services (PMS) during the current fiscal. We had applied to Sebi for a PMS licence in September and may get it soon, Anand said.         
	Axis Mutual will launch a tax-saving scheme in January next year.

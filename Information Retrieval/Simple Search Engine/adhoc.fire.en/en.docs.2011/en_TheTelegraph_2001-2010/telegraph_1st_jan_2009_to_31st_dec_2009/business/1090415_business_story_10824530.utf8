                                                                                                               Danone, Wadia settle brand tiff
                            
	New Delhi, April 14 (PTI): French food giant Groupe Danone and the Wadia Group today said they have ended a 13-year-old relationship in Britannia Industries by terminating their existing joint ventures in India and also resolved their dispute over the intellectual property of Tiger brand of biscuits.        
	As part of this agreement, Danone has sold its 50 per cent interest in ABI Holdings Limited (held through Britannia Brands Limited) to Wadia Group. ABI Holdings Limited holds an effective 50.96 per cent interest in Britannia Industries Limited, a leading bakery company in India, the two firms said in a joint statement.        
	This agreement also sees an end to the intellectual property dispute over brand Tiger between Danone and Britannia, the statement added.        
	Wadia Group is pleased with this acquisition. Over the last 9 decades, Britannia has created a rich heritage of brands and a strong corporate reputation which has seen several ownership changes... The company is led and managed by a competent team of professionals, who will continue to explore profitable growth opportunities in food - both in India and overseas, Britannia Industries chairman Nusli N Wadia said.        
	Groupe Danone CEO Franck Riboud said, Danone is more keen than ever to contribute to the development of the healthy food market by implementing Danone brands in India in the coming years. quot;         
	Thirteen years of collaboration between the Wadia Group and Groupe Danone in Britannia helped to build a strong and respected leader in the Indian biscuits industry, he added.        
	By concluding this agreement, Groupe Danone is pursuing its strategy of divesting its biscuit activities.

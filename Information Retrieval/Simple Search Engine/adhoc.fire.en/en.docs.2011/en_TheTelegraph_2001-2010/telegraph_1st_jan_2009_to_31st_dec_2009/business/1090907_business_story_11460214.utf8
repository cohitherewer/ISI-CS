The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Ford plans new engine for small car
                                                                                                               Ford plans new engine for small car
          SOUNAK MITRA                                         
	Maraimalai Nagar (Chennai), Sept. 6: Ford India, which plans to launch its Rs 3-lakh plus small cars in early 2010, intends to use the EcoBoost engine in them.         
	According to the company, the engine will increase fuel mileage by 20 per cent.         
	It will reduce carbon dioxide emissions by 15 per cent compared with conventional petrol and diesel engines.         
	Using the gasoline turbo-charged direct-injection technology, EcoBoost will enable Ford to meet future emission norms.         
	The company has already introduced the technology in compact cars and large trucks in the US.         
	Initially, we will develop the 1.2-litre petrol and 1.5-litre diesel engine with regular technology to benefit from the governments policy of lower excise on such engine sizes. We will introduce the much expensive EcoBoost engines in the long-term, Ford India president and managing director Mechael Boneham said.         
	Ford plans to take the small car beyond India to other emerging markets such as China, eastern Europe and South America, Timothy D. Tucker, vice-president (sales) of Ford India, said. We plan to grow our business in B (small) cars globally, especially in the Asia-Pacific region where we plan to raise the share of B cars from 15 per cent to 45 per cent, he said.         
	The car will be made with 85 per cent local components, with the vendors located within the 352-acre plant in Maraimalai Nagar, about 50 km from Chennai.         
	Ford has set up a new engine plant at Chennai and is doubling its capacity to 2 lakh units per annum, as part of a $500-million fresh investment plan for the country, announced earlier.         
	The plant presently produces only 30,000 units and works a single shift, while the installed capacity is for three shifts.         
	The expansion is expected to turn Chennai into a strategic production hub at a competitive cost for Fords global operations. The company is looking to save 15-20 per cent on engine costs after developing a local vendor base in Chennai.         
	With the proposed investment, the plant will attain 30 per cent automation. Ford has deployed 66 robots in the factory.

          SOUNAK MITRA                       In slow lane                           
	Calcutta, Aug. 30: The governments plan to set up a tea park in Calcutta to help exporters has hit a roadblock because of problems over land acquisition.         
	The land price is very high and we are not getting any suitable plot within the Kolkata Port Trust area, Roshni Sen, deputy chairperson of the Tea Board of India, told The Telegraph.         
	The proposed park will be set up in a public-private partnership model. The hunt is on for two warehouses of 2 lakh square feet area along with 10 acres of land.        
	Earlier, the Kolkata Port Trust and the Tea Board had decided to set up the park near Kidderpore Dock Number Two. The warehouses and the adjoining land were to be provided by the port authorities on a lease.        
	However, because of the high prices, the Tea Board decided to look for an alternative plot within the Kolkata Port Trust area.         
	At the moment, the Kolkata Port Trust is without a chairman and we are waiting for a new chairman to take over. We will again discuss the project with them and try to execute the project at an alternative piece of land, Sen said. A.K. Chanda, who was the previous chairman of the Kolkata Port Trust, completed his term in March this year.         
	Meanwhile, an industry source said the Tea Board had been shown land at Uluberia in Howrah and at Rajarhat for the same project.         
	ICICI-West Bengal Infrastructure Development Corporation Ltd, a joint venture between the state government and ICICI Bank, has been appointed as the consultant for the project.         
	The tea park will accommodate warehousing, blending, packaging and common facilities for exports. Provisions for bank and courier services, technical support, residue laboratories, an IT corner, a business centre, a weighbridge, suppliers of paper sacks and eateries will also be a part of the project.         
	The Tea Board is setting up a similar park in Siliguri covering 50 acres.        
	The foundation stone had been laid on January 15 this year. The West Bengal Industrial Development Corporation, the Siliguri Jalpaiguri Development Authority and another private partner will invest in the project.        
	India has set a target of exporting around 200 million kg tea in 2009-10.

	Calcutta, Sept. 4: Essar Steel has appointed Malay Mukherjee as its chief executive officer, days after he quit ArcelorMittal.        
	Mukherjee, 61, will take charge from October 15. On September 1, he stepped down from the board of ArcelorMittal. Before ArcelorMittal, Mukherjee was the executive director of Steel Authority of India Limited.        
	Mukherjee, who hails from Asansol, was a trusted lieutenant of steel czar Lakshmi Niwas Mittal, with whom he worked for 16 years.        
	He was associated with Mittals Ispat Group in many important capacities; he was the president and chief operating officer of Ispat International, before joining Mittal Steel in 2004 as the chief operating officer.        
	In May 2008, Mittal took him on the board of ArcelorMittal, the worlds largest steel company. Previously, he was also a member of the companys group management board, with responsibility for the Asian, African and CIS regions as well as the mining, stainless and pipes and tubes divisions.        
	An alumnus of IIT Kharagpur, Mukherjee is joining Essar Steel at a time when the industry is going through a rough patch because of recession. Malay Mukherjee comes with valuable international experience in the steel business and is an excellent addition to Essar Groups dynamic leadership team, Shashi Ruia, chairman, Essar Group, said in a statement on the appointment.        
	Braving the weak markets, Essar plans to commission its expanded facilities at Hazira by early next year that were built at an investment of Rs 13,000 crore and took the capacity to 10 million tonnes (mt) per annum from 4.6mt. At the same time, the companys Algoma Steel in Canada is expanding capacity from 3.2mt to 4mt.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Blow to BSNL
                                                                                                               Blow to BSNL
                            
	New Delhi, May 12 (PTI): The telecom tribunal has rejected a bunch of petitions by state-run Bharat Sanchar Nigam Ltd challenging the removal of the access deficit charge  a levy paid by private operators to fund the PSUs rural and remote operations.        
	A tribunal bench headed by Justice Arun Kumar said BSNL had no legal right to claim the access deficit charge (ADC) from private operators and the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai) had rightly terminated it.        
	We hold that BSNL has no legal right to ADC. It was rightly terminated in 2008-09 and the manner of calculating ADC each year was fair and reasonable, given the facts available with Trai, the Telecom Disputes Settlement and Appellate Tribunal said.        
	Trai abolished ADC in 2008-09. In 2007-08, the regulator had reduced ADC by 37 per cent to Rs 2,000 crore from Rs 3,200 crore.         
	BSNL had challenged Trais decision.         
	The tribunal also rejected BSNLs contention that Trai was wrong while calculating ADC and relied on faulty data.        
	It further said BSNL did not have any reliable data over the quantum of loss suffered by it for its rural obligations.

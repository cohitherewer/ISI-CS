                                                                                                               Stake sale makes L amp;T boss Naik richer by Rs 15cr
          PIYA SINGH                               
	Mumbai, June 21: A.M. Naik, the chairman and managing director of the $8.5-billion engineering giant Larsen and Toubro, has scooped up Rs 15 crore by selling 4 per cent of his holding in the company in the past fortnight.        
	Naik sold over 95,000 shares in four transactions between June 5 and June 10 to rake in Rs 14.99 crore. He isnt the only top honcho who has sold his shares to take advantage of the fierce bull run in the past month. K.V. Rangaswami, a whole-time director in L amp;T, made a neat Rs 1.4 crore by selling 10,000 shares of L amp;T on June 1.                   
	In the third quarter of 2008-09, Naik had increased his shareholding in the company as he accumulated over 1.88 lakh shares amounting to around Rs 14.5 crore between October 17 and December 2, 2008, according to data available with the Bombay Stock Exchange.         
	Naik has 21.1 lakh shares in L amp;T after the recent stock sale, which amount to 0.36 per cent of the companys paid-up capital. A portion has been garnered through the employee stock option schemes that the company offers its employees. At Fridays closing price of Rs 1,496.10 on the BSE, Naiks holding in L amp;T amounted to an impressive Rs 316 crore.         
	After the June 1 sale, Rangaswami still owns 1.9 lakh shares in the engineering company. Market analysts and investment bankers say the surge in the sensex has created several overvalued stocks. They believe that the stock sale by the L amp;T top brass has been timed right since they expect the bellwether index to head southward sometime soon.         
	The L amp;T stock hit a 52-week low of Rs 557 on the BSE on March 9. The stock has risen 168.6 per cent since then. The sensex has risen 78 per cent during the same period.         
	The last time that a big stock sale by a top executive drew media attention was in early March when Manoj Kohli, chief executive and joint managing director of Bharti Airtel, sold 1.23 lakh shares and raised Rs 7.5 crore. Subsequently, in mid-May, Kohli acquired 80,000 shares in Bharti Airtel by converting his stock options at a cost of just over Rs 3 crore.         
	The promoters of Infosys have often sold a part of their holdings in the past, mainly to fund charitable causes.

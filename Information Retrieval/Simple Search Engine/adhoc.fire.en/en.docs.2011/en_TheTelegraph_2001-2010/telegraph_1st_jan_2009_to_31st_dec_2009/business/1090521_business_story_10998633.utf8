The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Govt ready to crack down on rising rupee 
                                                                                                               Govt ready to crack down on rising rupee 
          JAYANTA ROY CHOWDHURY AMP; R.SURYAMURTHY                          Red signal                                  
	New Delhi, May 20: The government and the RBI are open to taking steps to prevent the appreciation of the rupee, following intense lobbying by exporters.        
	Though the policy-makers have not fixed any level for the rupee, they have decided to intervene to prevent the Indian currency from appreciating rapidly.         
	In other words, they are willing to calibrate the rise of the rupee to protect the exporters.        
	After falling to Rs 52 to a dollar two months ago, the rupee is now at Rs 47.6, sending shockwaves among exporters reeling under the impact of the global recession. A rising rupee means exporters get less of the Indian currency per dollar.        
	The central bank is opposed to an all-out intervention as a strong rupee is a deterrent to inflation, whose surge last year was a major embarrassment to the UPA.        
	RBI does not want an all out interventionist policy as it believes that a strong rupee can prove a deterrent to inflation which has proved to be a political embarrassment to the Congress-led government last year.        
	The strengthening of the rupee is expected to hit the already depressed textile sector, whose markets in the US and Europe have fallen 20 per cent in the last few months. BPOs have similarly been hit.         
	On the other hand, imports are becoming easier as the rupee can now buy more dollars.        
	Export realisations would be hit if the rupee continues to strengthen. We would be back to square one if the government does not help out the exporters, D.K. Nair, secretary of the Confederation of Indian Textile Industry, said.        
	However, exporters believe the rising rupee is a temporary phenomenon and the trend is unlikely to continue.         
	Ajay Sahai, director-general of the Federation of the Indian Export Organisations, said, This is an aberration and not based on economic fundamentals. We think the rupee would bounce back to its fundamental value of around Rs 49 in about three month time.

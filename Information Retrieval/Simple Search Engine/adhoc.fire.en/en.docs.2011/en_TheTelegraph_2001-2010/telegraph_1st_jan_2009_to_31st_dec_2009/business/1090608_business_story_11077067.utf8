                                                                                                                 Q amp;A      Stock slide
                                I had invested in Reliance Growth Fund through a monthly SIP of Rs 1,000 for 5 years. The SIP started on November 16, 2006. According to the quarterly statement as of February 2009, my total investment is Rs 27,000 while its market value is Rs 18,663.72. Since the SIP is for five years, should I continue to invest for the remaining months?          D. Das, Garden Reach
                    The stock market was on an upswing when you started investing. However, for every monthly SIP installment of Rs 1,000, you got less and less units till January 2008 when the stock prices crashed. In the next eight months, stock prices lost their gains of the last three years. As a result, the NAV of all equity mutual funds fell sharply. This is why you saw loss in your investment statement. However, markets again started moving up from March this year. The NAV was Rs 33.12 as on February 2, 2009 and it appreciated to Rs 56.19 as on June 4, 2009  a growth of 69.68 per cent. You should continue with your investments.                                  Investment plan      My husband and I both are senior citizens. We want to invest Rs 1 lakh each in PPF. What is the annual exemption limit on income for us and what is the maximum deduction we can claim u/s 80C?        K. Eswaramma, Calcutta
                    For senior citizens, the basic exemption limit is Rs 2,25,000. Under Section 80C, the maximum deduction one can claim is Rs 1 lakh.                                  Term deposits      I have two term deposits of Rs 60,000 each with West Bengal State Co-operative Bank Ltd. The deposits are for 1000 days and carry an annual interest rate of 9.5 per cent. The maturity value of each FD is Rs 75,616. Therefore, the interest is not compounded quarterly. If it was, the maturity value of each FD would have been Rs 77,650.78 in 2 years 9 months and not Rs 75,616. Could you please explain why?        Sukumar Saha, Calcutta
                    All banks do not give quarterly compounding interest on fixed deposits. Some banks give yearly compounding interest also. You shall have to check this out with your bank. Besides, there may be tax deducted at source by the bank as and when it credits the interest to your account.

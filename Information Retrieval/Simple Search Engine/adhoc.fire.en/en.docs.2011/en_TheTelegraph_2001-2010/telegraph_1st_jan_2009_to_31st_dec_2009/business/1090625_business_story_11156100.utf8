          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      Praful Patel
  Civil aviation minister                          
	New Delhi, June 24: The government will help Air India by pumping in more equity and arranging for soft loans, but it wants the airline to come up with a financial and organisational restructuring plan.         
	Help in the form of equity and some form of soft loan can come but Air India has to go in for a lot of organisational and financial restructuring, said civil aviation minister Praful Patel after a meeting with Prime Minister Manmohan Singh. The government cant keep giving Air India cheques unconditionally.         
	During the meeting, Singh suggested the setting up of a committee of secretaries, headed by the cabinet secretary.         
	The airline management will present its financial and organisational restructuring plan before this panel within a month.         
	Air India has sought an equity infusion of about Rs 1,250 crore and soft loans of about Rs 3,000 crore.         
	The national carrier has been facing a cash crunch on the back of mounting losses which are likely to be Rs 4,300 crore for 2008-09 nearly double of what it was in the previous year.        
	According to the minister, the Prime Minister has said the government will support Air India. It is a national carrier and it is our pride.         
	But there is a condition that Air India must put its best foot forward. The employees must realise that there is a problem and it is a cumulative one, Patel said.        
	Besides the cabinet secretary, the committee will have the finance secretary, the Prime Ministers principal secretary and the civil aviation secretary as members. It will meet every month to review the progress of the airline.         
	Patel said he had indicated to the Prime Minister that all airlines needed help in the form of lower taxes on jet fuel.         
	Officials said the restructuring package that Air India was being asked to draw up could include delaying purchase of planes and selling and leasing back planes.        
	Officials said many routes were unviable. Suspending operations on uneconomic routes would be among the options we are being asked to accept. officials said.        
	The committee would also be insisting on the complete integration of the two airlines  Air India and Indian Airlines  which could see offices merging, and some people turning surplus.        
	Restructuring of the board and manpower rationalisation through a VRS programme could also be among the measures the airline would have to accept to get the bail-out from the government.         
	The airline has already said it will try to cut staff costs by Rs 500 crore.         
	It has told employees that June salaries will be delayed by 15 days, triggering a strike threat by 20,000 employees, more than two-thirds of its workforce.        
	A combination of high fuel prices, fewer passengers and the global financial meltdown has left the airline in the red.         
	The Indian airline industry is estimated to have run up losses of up to Rs 10,000 crore in 2008-09.

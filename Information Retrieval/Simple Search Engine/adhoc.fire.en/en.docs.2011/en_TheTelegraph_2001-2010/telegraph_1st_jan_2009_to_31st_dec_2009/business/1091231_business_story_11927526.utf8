	New Delhi, Dec. 30: Bharti Airtel chief Sunil Mittal is in Bangladesh to seal a deal with Warid Telecom.        
	Bharti wants to acquire a 70 per cent stake in Warid, the fourth largest telecom operator in Bangladesh.         
	Mittals visit comes just before Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh Hasinas proposed visit here from January 11.        
	Under the deal, Bharti will buy out Warid for about $900 million and initially invest $300 million for expansion.         
	Sources in the Bangladesh government said the deal could be done when Hasina was in India.        
	A Bharti spokesperson declined to comment on Mittals visit. Sources said the Bharti chief had met the top brass of Bangladeshs telecom ministry yesterday and pushed for early clearances.         
	Mittal also had a dinner date yesterday with Warids top executives in Bangladesh at Hotel Westin in Dhakas posh Gulshan area.         
	During the course of the meeting with the government officials, Mittal unveiled plans to pump fresh funds into Warid and take it to the second spot, after Grameen Telecom. Run by Grameen Bank, a co-operative initiative, Grameen Telecom is the largest operator in Bangladesh.         
	The $1.2-billion deal could be the largest foreign investment in Bangladesh in recent times.         
	However, this could not be confirmed by the officials of the Bangladesh High Commission.        
	Formal approval        
	Bharti has sought the permission of the Bangladesh Telecommunication Regulatory Commission for the deal.         
	Sources said the regulator had asked for Airtels investment plans, approvals from the boards of Bharti and Abu Dhabi-based Warid and a financial strategy on how Warids existing loan liabilities would be paid off.         
	Bharti has been looking for opportunities in emerging markets after it called off talks for a $23-billion merger with South Africas MTN in September. Last month, Bharti had bid for the South African operations of Luxembourgs Millicom.        
	Earlier, Bharti Airtel and Reliance Communications had submitted a joint proposal to the Bangladesh telecom regulator for building an optic fibre network to provide low-cost services in the northeastern parts of India.         
	In return, Bharti-Reliance had offered Bangladesh linkages to an undersea cable network to complement the existing SEA-ME-WE-4 (South East Asia-Middle East-Western Europe-4) undersea cable lines.

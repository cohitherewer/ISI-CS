The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Budget wish list gets longer
                                                                                                               Budget wish list gets longer
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                                Pranab Mukherjee in New Delhi on Tuesday. (PTI)        
	New Delhi, June 2: Exporters sought tax sops and a Rs 5000-crore market development fund from finance minister Pranab Mukherjee during the pre-budget meeting today.        
	Separately, infotech captains requested Mukherjee to continue with the tax incentives.        
	Sources said Mukherjee was open to giving some fiscal sops to exporters. He, however, appeared to be uncomfortable about too much relief, given the countrys high fiscal deficit.        
	The exporters wish list also included the elimination of the fringe benefit tax, exemption from income tax, reduction of interest rates and speedier insurance and service tax refunds.        
	Exporters are passing through a difficult phase in view of the global slowdown. Income tax exemption for five years will help us reduce prices and remain competitive. The government should take immediate steps to prevent the sector from sinking further. Appreciation of the rupee has meant more gloom for us, A. Sakthivel, president of the Federation of Indian Export Organisations, said.        
	Sakthivel said there were signs of improved demand, but buyers had become very cost-conscious. The Indian government should provide incentives so that exporters can keep a rein on prices.         
	Exporters will meet commerce minister Anand Sharma tomorrow.        
	Meanwhile, Nasscom, the software lobby group, sought tax breaks and sops from Mukherjee.        
	The Nasscom delegation, headed by chairman Pramod Bhasin, demanded the extension of tax benefits for firms and small and medium companies housed in software technology parks beyond April next year. In addition, the delegation wanted an end to the multiplicity of taxes such as fringe benefit tax.        
	Meeting with states        
	Pranab Mukherjee will break tradition and meet state finance ministers to discuss the budget. The finance minister had been very kind and said he would welcome suggestions on the budget from us (state finance ministers). We will be meeting him on goods and services tax later this month, said Bengal finance minister Asim Dasgupta.

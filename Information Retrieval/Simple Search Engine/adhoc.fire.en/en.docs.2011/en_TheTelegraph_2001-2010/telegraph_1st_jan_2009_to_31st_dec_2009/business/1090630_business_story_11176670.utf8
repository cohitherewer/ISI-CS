The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Sop boost for new tax plan
                                                                                                               Sop boost for new tax plan
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                          Vijay Kelkar in New Delhi on Monday. (PTI)                                  
	New Delhi, June 29: The government is exploring the possibility of compensating states for revenue lost because of the goods and services tax (GST). The move could encourage states to go for the new tax regime, which is scheduled to take effect from April 1, 2010.        
	The country could gain $15 billion annually by implementing the tax.         
	Some states may want assurances that existing revenues will be protected when they implement the goods and services tax. The Finance Commission is willing to consider offering compensation, Vijay Kelkar, chairman of the 13th Finance Commission, said at an industry event.        
	He said the implementation of GST had raised Canadas GDP by 1.4 per cent and would help India redistribute the tax burden equitably between manufacturing and services.        
	The new levy will replace all major central and state taxes. It is expected to lower the tax rates by broadening the tax base and minimising exemptions.        
	Finance minister Pranab Mukherjee is expected to outline the roadmap for GST in the upcoming budget. At a pre-budget meeting with Mukherjee, the state finance ministers had demanded compensation.         
	Although the Centre is mulling five-year compensation, the states are opposed to the idea of any time frame.         
	Under the GST structure, the tax will be collected by the states where the goods or services are consumed.         
	This might result in heavy losses for the producer states.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Ban blessing for cheap handsets
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Ban blessing for cheap handsets
          JAYATI GHOSE                          Reaping profits                                  
	New Delhi, Dec. 2: The ban on cheap Chinese handsets may mean big business for low-end mobile brands such as Fly, Airfone and Spice.         
	The companies expect a good growth in sales as customers replace locked out Chinese handsets with low-cost branded ones.        
	Some of these handset makers are also offering free talktime to attract customers. Companies such as Spice are also issuing advisories to assure buyers of their authenticity.        
	We expect the ban on Chinese handsets to work in our favour. At our price points the customer is assured of a branded product with a unique identity number for the price of a Chinese mobile, Vishal Chitkara, director of Airfone, told The Telegraph.        
	Customers using Chinese handsets are looking for a number of features at very low rates, he said. Airfone, Spice, Fly and others make handsets in the entry level price band  Rs 1,400 to Rs 5,000  with radio, MP3, dual-SIM card, bluetooth, expandable memory and camera.        
	Pankaj Mahindroo, national president of the Indian Cellular Association, agreed that the market share of low-cost handsets is likely to increase. Now low-cost handsets have a share of 15 per cent against 20 per cent cornered by unbranded handsets.         
	Once these non-IMEI handsets vanish from markets, the small players are likely to gain, he said.

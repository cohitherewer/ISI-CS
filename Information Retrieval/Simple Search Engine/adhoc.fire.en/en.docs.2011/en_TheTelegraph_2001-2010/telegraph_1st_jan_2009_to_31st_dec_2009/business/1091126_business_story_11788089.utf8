The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Gold shines bright on global cues
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Gold shines bright on global cues
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                            
	Calcutta, Nov. 25: A falling dollar is catapulting gold prices to dizzy heights both at home and abroad.        
	While the yellow metal scaled fresh peaks in London and New York, it crossed Rs 18,000 per 10 gram (24-carat) in Delhi and flared up by Rs 425 to settle at Rs 17,985 per 10 gram in Calcutta.        
	In India, the local stockists are taking cue from abroad and have gone on a buying spree.         
	Prices have climbed to new highs in London and New York on a further drop of the dollar.         
	Gold for immediate delivery jumped 0.9 per cent to $1,180.20 an ounce in London.         
	According to experts, the price of the precious metal may advance to $1,200 next week.        
	However, the high prices in India have led to a 22-25 per cent decline in jewellery demand ahead of the marriage season.        
	Local jewellers said people were cutting down on their purchases as prices had jumped too high too fast.         
	This is a question of affordability, said a shop manager at a local jewellery shop, adding that they were selling 22-carat gold jewellery instead of 24-carat ones. People are asking for cheaper jewellery, he said.        
	A ring that would have cost Rs 5,000 last year was now selling for Rs 8,000.         
	Over and above the dollar, the Reserve Bank of Indias purchase of 200 tonnes of the yellow metal from the IMF on November 3 has seen gold prices jumping 13 per cent.        
	The surge in price today could be attributed to reports that the RBI might buy more gold from the IMF, which is yet to sell another 200 tonnes, said a bullion analyst at a leading brokerage.        
	Since the RBIs purchase, the central banks of Mauritius, Russia and Sri Lanka have expressed their intention of buying gold from the IMF.         
	The increased demand for gold from the central banks of the emerging economies in recent times has pushed up prices in global markets, the analyst said.        
	According to gold traders, investment demand, particularly from gold exchange traded funds, is very strong amid apprehensions about global economic recovery.         
	Meanwhile, for a third day on the trot, the dollar has lost in value against 13 of the 15 major global currencies.

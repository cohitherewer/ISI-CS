The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Stock trade to start an hour early

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                            
	Mumbai, Dec. 16: The stock markets will start trading from 9 am on Friday  55 minutes sooner than they used to.        
	On Tuesday, the Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) had decided unilaterally to advance its market opening by 10 minutes to 9:45 am.        
	The National Stock Exchange  which has an average trading volume in its cash segment that is almost three-and-a-half times more than the BSEs  cranked up the war of the bourses by deciding to open for trading at 9 am, forcing a reluctant BSE to toe the line. Both bourses will halt trading at 3:30 pm.        
	The BSE, which is Asias oldest stock exchange, has been trying to steal a march over its rival, which accounts for 75 per cent of the trading volumes in the cash market and nearly all of the derivative volumes.        
	The NSE had initiated the move for longer trading hours earlier this year. In mid-October, the capital market watchdog Sebi permitted the stock markets to extend timings by up to two and a half hours in order to give investors the opportunity to trade on developments in South East Asian and Far Eastern markets.        
	However, the NSE could not push ahead with its plan because its members werent convinced that longer trading hours would boost trading volumes and smoothen out the volatility in the markets.        
	But after the BSE fired the first salvo, the NSE top brass went into a long huddle with market participants and persuaded them to agree to an early start to trading.        
	James Shapiro, BSEs head of marketing, told a television channel late tonight that the bourse had no option but to follow NSEs lead.        
	The whole debate on the extension of market hours started after the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) decided on October 23 to give the bourses the flexibility to offer investors trading facilities from 9 am to 5 pm.         
	The market regulator took this decision after it received representations that volumes were shifting to other bourses such as the Singapore Stock Exchange which starts trading Nifty futures at 6.30 am IST.        
	Sebi also felt that the extension of trading hours would allow domestic market participants to take advantage of global information flows.        
	However, small brokers were opposing the move on the ground that there were logistical constraints and the big worry that it would be hard to transfer money within the banking system after 3:30 pm.        
	Market mavens were divided on the benefits that would flow from longer trading hours.        
	Ambareesh Baliga, vice-president of Karvy Stock Broking, said: We will see volumes increasing a bit and a part of the SGX Nifty volumes will shift to India. Volumes will rise because of greater interest among intra-day traders, he said.        
	Baliga said the flip side was that market dealers would come under greater stress.        
	However, Arun Kejriwal, director of KRIS, said the extension would not lead to any increase in volumes. Those who trade or invest in the market will not carry out more transactions just because of the extension, he said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Tax tweaks give SEZs a breather
                                                                                                               Tax tweaks give SEZs a breather
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Tariff bonanza                                  
	Mumbai, March 4: The government has thrown a lifeline to special economic zones (SEZs) by tweaking its rules relating to the payment of service tax on a suite of services provided to the developers of these enclaves.        
	The rules on the payment of service tax by SEZs were a little fuzzy  with developers of SEZs entitled to exemptions on the payment of the tax on some services.        
	While that may have sounded like a good thing, it really wasnt because the exemptions meant that the entire supply chain couldnt easily claim setoffs on the service tax they had paid on a service provided by an upstream supplier. Exemptions broke up the chain and created problems for everyone.        
	So, the government put out a notification today that seeks to cap the controversy over the tax exemptions for services provided to a special economic zone.        
	The department of revenue has now clarified that the service tax will have to be paid irrespective of whether these services are consumed within or outside the SEZ. The entities will then be entitled to claim a refund.        
	Currently, services provided physically in the SEZ like security and others are exempt from tax while those provided by advertising agencies, management consultants and others from outside the zone are not. The move to broaden the ambit of tax exemption even to services not physically provided in the SEZ will reduce the cost of production.        
	In effect, the exemption will still be available. The difference is that now the consumer of services, whether it is the SEZ developer or a unit within the SEZ, will pay the tax and then claim a refund.         
	At last count, there were about 552 developers who had received clearances to set up these special, tax-free enclaves.        
	This notification, which supersedes an earlier one issued on March 31, 2004, has several implications.        
	First, it will reduce costs in the entire supply chain. Under the notification issued in 2004, the service provider could not reverse any Cenvat charge as he was exempt from paying tax. This benefit will now be available.        
	For instance, if a service provider outsourced a portion of the services rendered, he would have to pay tax on the amount of services farmed out. At the same time, he could not claim the tax paid to the outsourced party considering that the service tax for SEZs developers was exempt. Under the new notification, the provider can eliminate the cascading effect of taxation and bring down costs in the entire supply chain, said Ernst amp; Youngs partner-indirect taxes Uday Pimprikar.        
	Second, the notification has put to rest doubts on whether services rendered outside the SEZ will be taxable or not. For instance, a consultancy service rendered outside the SEZ but delivered to a SEZ developer or unit can now get the refund. This eliminates a lot of confusion that is prevalent in the department, said PriceWaterhouseCoopers executive director R. Muralidharan.        
	However, tax experts also see a downside to this new notification. There is a high probability that there will be long delays in obtaining the refunds. Not only will working capital be tied up till refunds are actually disbursed, but the process of paying tax and then obtaining refunds is going to be time consuming, said Muralidharan.

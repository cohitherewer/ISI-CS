The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Fresh flare-up in Ambani gas tussle
                                                                                                               Fresh flare-up in Ambani gas tussle
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              Mukesh and Anil Ambani				                                 
	New Delhi, Sept. 24: The Ambani brothers got embroiled in a fresh spat today with Mukesh Ambani-run Reliance Industries Limited threatening to suspend gas supply to a power plant run by brother Anils Reliance Infrastructure.        
	The notice has been issued due to default committed by Reliance Infrastructure in payment of the amounts due, under the invoice for gas supplied during the first fortnight of September 2009, Reliance Industries (RIL) said in a statement issued two days back.        
	Reliance Infrastructure reacted sharply. It questioned the legality of RILs warning and said the dispute was over not paying an illegal marketing margin.        
	Until this bonafide and genuine dispute with regard to legality of marketing margin is resolved, you are not entitled to suspend the operation of the GSPA (gas sales purchase agreement) or disrupt supplies, Reliance Infrastructure wrote to Reliance Industries.         
	On September 22, RIL served a notice to Reliance Infrastructure for the suspension of gas from its Krishna-Godavari (KG) fields because of a payment default in the first fortnight of this month. RIL supplies 0.55 million metric standard cubic metres of gas per day (mmscmd) to Reliance Infrastructures power plant at Samalkot in Andhra Pradesh.         
	Last week, the Reliance Anil Dhirubhai Ambani Group firm had said that it would stop paying $0.135 per million British thermal unit (mBtu) marketing margin on the gas from RIL as the charge was not authorised by the government and was illegal.        
	We are continuing to make the payment of lawful sales consideration at the rate of $4.2 per mBtu and are entitled to receive uninterrupted supply of gas under GSPA, Reliance Infrastructure wrote to RIL.        
	The brothers are already engaged in a legal dispute over the pricing of Reliances KG gas. Anil Ambani wants the gas at $2.34 per mBtu, while Mukesh is willing to sell only at the government-mandated price of $4.20. The Supreme Court will hear the case on October 20.        
	NTPC pact        
	Power utility NTPC, which, too, has been seeking to enforce a contract on gas from RIL at a much lower price, has signed an agreement to buy KG gas for its Anta (Rajasthan), Dadri (Uttar Pradesh) and Faridabad (Haryana) plants at $4.2 per mBtu.        
	NTPCs dispute with RIL is for gas to its Kawas and Gandhar plants in Gujarat. The PSU wants gas at $2.34 per mBtu.

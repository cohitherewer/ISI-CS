	New Delhi, Feb. 1: Consumers can enjoy cheaper loans as interest rates are set to fall by 50-100 basis points.         
	External affairs minister Pranab Mukherjee, handling the finance ministry in the absence of Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, will meet the officials of top public sector banks on Monday. He is likely to urge banks to reduce interest rates to help revive demand in the economy.         
	According to finance ministry officials, PSU banks will be told to cut rates by mid-February. At present, state-run banks charge about 10-12.5 per cent interest from home loan borrowers and 11.5-12.5 per cent from car buyers. Private banks charge at least 100-400 basis points more.        
	Banks are expected to cut their prime lending rates (PLR), or the benchmark interest rate at which they lend to blue chip customers, by 50-100 basis points. This will lead to a lowering of interest rates on home, auto and retail loans by the same magnitude. PLR of state-run banks currently ranges between 12 per cent and 13 per cent.        
	Once state-run banks slash rates, pressure will mount on their private sector rivals to follow suit.        
	The government wants to spruce up retail demand as sagging auto and real estate sales are emerging as serious threats to economic growth. It will also ask banks to submit an assessment on credit given to the housing sector, small businesses and infrastructure firms.         
	According to the government, banks should maintain a steady credit flow, while the Reserve Bank of India continues to pump more money into the system through aggressive reductions in key policy rates.        
	The repo  which is the rate at which banks borrow short-term funds from the RBI  has been trimmed to 5.5 per cent.         
	The cash reserve ratio, or the portion of deposits that banks must maintain with the RBI, stands at 5 per cent.        
	Credit flow has increased significantly after the rate reductions by the central bank. Finance ministry data suggest that between September last year and January this year, Rs 1,01,000 crore was lent to borrowers, mostly industrial units. This represents an increase of more than 28 per cent over the Rs 78,500 crore lent during the same period last year.         
	These figures do not take into account the money lent to farmers and commodity traders.         
	The total amount sanctioned during the period was a huge Rs 2,65,000 crore, and only a fraction of the sum was accessed by those who wanted to borrow on account of the economic slowdown.        
	Industry is in a dire need of a credit boost. Industrial growth dipped 0.2 per cent in October and rose just 2.4 per cent in November. Growth in the six core industries  steel, petroleum, crude oil, coal, electricity and cement  was a mere 3.5 per cent through April-December 2008.        
	There is enough money in the system. Banks want to lend as they are borrowing money at 8-9 per cent and need to give loans and not park money with the RBI which is now paying a miserable 5.5 per cent interest, officials said.         
	However, the nudge to bring down interest rates means deposit rates will have to be brought down. State-run banks now pay between 8 per cent and 9.5 per cent as fixed deposit rates. These may have to be reduced to 8-9 per cent to allow banks to make profits from their loans.         
	K.C. Chakrabarty, chairman of Punjab National Bank, said, Systemic issues such as small savings deposit and sub-PLR rates have to be worked out before we can cut deposit rates further. Punjab National Bank had pre-empted Mukherjee by cutting lending rates by 50 basis points last week.         
	Small savings schemes offer an 8 per cent interest-free rate of return. Banks will have to offer rates which are more attractive to woo depositors. The government is unlikely to bring down the rate of small savings ahead of the elections as this can turn into a major issue for the middle-class voter.

	New Delhi, Sept. 26: Suzuki Motorcycle India is all set to foray into the entry-level motorcycle market, launch its second premium bike and hopes to break even in the Indian market this fiscal.        
	Suzuki Motorcycle is also undergoing a feasibility study to launch its second gearless scooter in 2011, Atul Gupta, vice-president-sales amp; marketing, told The Telegraph.        
	Suzuki sells five two-wheeler models in the country. These are the gearless scooter Access 125, two motorcycles Zeus 125cc and GS150R and two superbikes  1300cc Hayabusa and the 1700cc Intruder.        
	Our strategy is to have a value for money bike in the Rs 40,000 segment, introduce at least one more motorcycle above 150cc and launch another superbike. Two of these three launches should happen next fiscal, said Gupta.         
	According to industry nomenclature, motorcycles with engine capacity greater than 75cc and less than 125cc constitute the entry-level segment.         
	The segment is dominated by Hero Honda, which enjoys nearly 80 per cent market share. Entry level or economy bikes, priced between Rs 40,000 and Rs 50,000, constitute 70 per cent of the 58 lakh motorcycle market. The segment is growing at around 14 per cent.        
	Suzuki will also import completely built units of its superbike 1,000cc GSX-R model series (also known as Gixxer).               
	Its other two superbike models Hayabusa and Intruder, costing around Rs 12.5 lakhs each, have together sold about 100 units since their launch 8 months back.        
	The company which started out independently in 2006 after exiting a joint venture with TVS Motor, expects to break even and make operating profits by the end of the fiscal.        
	We will achieve break-even by the end of this fiscal and expect to start making operating profits from there on, said Gupta.        
	The company will also expand manufacturing capacity in Gurgaon to meet rising demand from 1.75 lakh units to 2.5 lakh units by the end of the fiscal.        
	Since 2006, Suzuki has invested about Rs 400 crore on its Indian operations and plans to have a manufacturing capacity of 4 lakh units by 2012.        
	Of our total production, 60 per cent constitutes scooters and 40 per cent motorcycles. However, going forward, production will tilt more in favour of motorcycles since thats how the industry is structured, said Gupta.        
	The company currently produces 10,000 scooters a month but says there is a demand for producing minimum 25,000 units a month.        
	Suzuki, which is also Indias largest carmaker, started the wholly owned two-wheeler unit in 2006 after exiting an earlier joint venture with TVS Motor Co., which currently Indias third-largest two-wheeler maker by sales.

                                                                                                               Suitors queue up for Satyam 
  Local tech titans not in race for buyout          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Montek Singh Ahluwalia, deputy chairman of the Planning Commission, with CII chief mentor Tarun Das (left) and Sunil Bharti Mittal, chairman of Bharti Enterprises, in New Delhi on Tuesday. (PTI)                                         
	New Delhi, Jan. 20: Potential buyers are circling over Satyam Computer, which is on the mat following the revelation of a Rs 7,000-crore fraud.         
	Newly appointed board member Tarun Das today said, I have to truthfully say we have been approached by buyers  both MNCs and Indian companies. However, the board is yet to discuss the matter, Das, who is also CIIs chief mentor, added.        
	He said top Indian software firms were not among the suitors. TCS, Infosys and Wipro are the top three IT developers in the country. Das did not give any more detail.        
	Analysts said Larsen amp; Toubro was a serious bidder.        
	L amp;T chairman A.M. Naik today held meetings with the officials of the ministry of corporate affairs. With a 4 per cent stake, the construction firm along with the LIC are the largest shareholders in Satyam. Naik, however, ruled out a bid. L amp;T Infotech is the companys IT subsidiary.         
	Others in the race include HCL and Tech Mahendra. Satyam is Indias No. 4 software firm and counts Nestle and GE among its 690 clients. Its ability to provide quality work at competitive rates makes it difficult for the clients to shift to another firm.        
	Sources said L amp;T had appointed Nomura to evaluate the assets and liabilities of Satyam and make recommendations.         
	They said the potential buyers would tread with caution given the companys financial mess and the host of class action lawsuits in the US.        
	The new board is understood to have accelerated the process of appointing a merchant banker to identify the buyers. The sources said the names of Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan and Deutsche Bank were under consideration.        
	A buyer has reportedly emerged for Satyams BPO operations as well.         
	Essar group firm Aegis has submitted an expression of interest to acquire the BPO, the sources said. However, an Aegis spokesperson declined to comment.        
	The Satyam board is due to meet on January 22 and 23 in Hyderabad and the buyout is expected to top the agenda. The choice could be between a single investor and stakes to many entities.        
	Das said the board would discuss appointments to the positions of chief executive officer and chief financial officer, legal matters and the need for immediate cash infusion. He was speaking to reporters at the CII Partnership Summit.        
	The board would also discuss the US lawsuits and the necessity of the government to stand as a guarantor for loans.         
	Maytas board        
	The government is likely to replace the board of Maytas Properties and Maytas Infra, promoted by the family of Satyam founder B. Ramalinga Raju.        
	Sources said the government had approached the Company Law Board to replace the boards after initial inquiries showed a nexus between the Maytas twins and Satyam.        
	Investigators suspect that money from Satyam was wrongly shovelled into the Maytas twins partly through advances.         
	Sacking the existing board will facilitate the collection of records and books of the two companies.         
	Yesterday, the government had asked the Serious Frauds Investigation Office to probe the Maytas firms, following the revelations of the alleged nexus.

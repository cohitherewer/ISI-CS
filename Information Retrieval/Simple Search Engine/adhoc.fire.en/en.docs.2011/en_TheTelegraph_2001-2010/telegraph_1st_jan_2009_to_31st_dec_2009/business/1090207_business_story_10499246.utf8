          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          EASY TO BORROW                                  
	Mumbai, Feb. 6: The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has raised the ceiling on interest rate for banks borrowing foreign currency abroad and then lending the sum to exporters.        
	This is expected to help exporters who are finding it difficult to get foreign currency loans.        
	From 100 basis points above Libor (London interbank offered rate), the ceiling is 350 basis points above the benchmark.         
	Though loans will get more costly for banks and exporters, the move needs to be seen in the context of rising cost of funds, globally, because of the credit crunch.        
	Banks will not impose any other charges, including service and management fees, on exporters, barring out-of-pocket expenses.         
	Similar changes in interest rates have been permitted where the benchmarks are Euro Libor (Libor expressed in euros) and Euribor (European interbank offered rate).        
	For them, the ceiling is 150 basis points above six months Libor/Euro Libor/Euribor against 75 basis points above the benchmarks, previously.         
	The RBI also said that banks should obtain declarations from borrowers enjoying credit limits of Rs 5 crore and above from other banks.         
	The move is part of an initiative to improve information sharing among banks. The norms for information sharing were announced last year.        
	RBI governor D. Subbarao today said the central bank would explore all options to maintain a comfortable liquidity position.        
	We will maintain a very comfortable liquidity position. There are several options and measures that we can take to manage liquidity. We will explore and apply all of that, as appropriate, he said at a convocation.        
	In Delhi, commerce and industry minister Kamal Nath said the central bank would continue to take monetary steps to guard the economy from the impact of the global financial meltdown.        
	He said the RBI should take steps in a calibrated manner.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Diageo seeks equal share in USL
                                                                                                               Diageo seeks equal share in USL
          PIYA SINGH                                            
	Mumbai, Jan. 27: Diageo, the worlds largest beer, wine and spirits company, wants to become an equal partner with UB group chairman Vijay Mallya in United Spirits Ltd (USL).        
	USL is the flagship of Mallyas sprawling liquor business.        
	Mallya is heading to New York for a meeting with the Diageo top brass on Wednesday to discuss the sale of a 14.99 per cent stake in USL. However, he is likely to be greeted with a demand for a stake holding that is on a par with his own in USL.        
	Sources close to the development said, Mallya may only want to sell 14.99 per cent but Diageo is clear that it wants to have an equal say in the future of USL. Diageo also wants a very clear path to a majority holding.        
	Diageo was formed in 1997 with the merger of Guinness plc and Grand Metropolitan plc  the two UK-based brewers. It has a presence in India through a subsidiary called Diageo India that retails brands like Smirnoff and Johnnie Walker. It also has a 50:50 joint venture with Radico Khaitan for Indian Made Foreign Liquor.        
	Mallya is likely to meet Diageos Ivan Menezes, who is the president of the companys North American business and took over the mantle of chairman, Asia Pacific, in 2008.        
	Diageo can confirm that it is reviewing a possible collaboration with United Spirits Ltd. However, there is no certainty at this stage that these discussions will result in a transaction, said a Diageo spokesperson in response to a query on their intention to have an equal share as the Indian promoter group in USL.        
	While a UB spokesperson did not comment on Diageos intention to seek an equal share as the Indian promoter, Mallya told television channels on Wednesday, Well, the truth is that I am meeting Diageo on Wednesday morning in New York together with my senior team. I think we have said before that the treasury shares of United Spirits are available to a strategic investor, who will obviously bring some strategic benefit to USL as well as the cash that USL will get as a result of this sale.        
	Mallya holds 36.57 per cent in USL through United Breweries Holdings and other investment companies. He does not have a direct stake in USL.        
	Financial institutions hold 38.10 per cent and non-institutions hold 25.28 per cent. The rest is held by an overseas custodian against depository receipts.        
	United Breweries Holdings has pledged a substantial portion of the shares it holds in USL against loans.        
	Mallya has clarified his stand on the issue. As far as UB is concerned, let me state very categorically that I have not pledged any shares for cash. The shares that we have pledged are for top-up comfort only. Banks have lent to our constituent companies  United Spirits, United Breweries Holdings, and Kingfisher Airlines  on the strength of the assets and cash flows of these individual companies.

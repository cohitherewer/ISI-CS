	Calcutta, June 24: The government is planning to auction coal blocks for captive mining.        
	This will not only increase its revenues but also attract serious players, coal minister Sriprakash Jaiswal said.        
	At present, a screening committee decides the allotment of coal blocks, and priorities are given to applicants from the power sector.         
	Applications for less than 1 million tonnes (mt) coal mining from an open-cast mine or less than 0.25mt mining through underground mining are not accepted.         
	So far, 190 allottees have been given coal blocks having a total reserve of 40 billion tonnes for captive mining. However, only 13 blocks have started mining. The total production last year was a little less than 30mt, said Partha S. Bhattacharyya, chairman and managing director of Coal India Ltd (CIL).         
	However, Bhattacharyya said the auctioning would require changes in the Mines and Minerals (Regulations and Development) Act, 1957.         
	According to Jaiswal, about 80 per cent of Coal Indias new projects had to be deferred because of hurdles to land acquisition and delay in getting clearances from the forest and environmental departments.         
	In many cases where land had been acquired companies could not take physical possession, said the coal minister. We are talking to the states so that they take meaningful action to facilitate land acquisition, Jaiswal said.         
	On environmental clearances, Jaiswal said the state governments should give the approvals in a time-bound manner as followed by the Centre. The central forest and environment ministry has agreed to give clearances within six months if a project is located in the go area. Go areas are degraded forest land, which make up 42 per cent of Indias forest cover.         
	The ministry has also prepared an action plan for the first 100 days of the new government. On the agenda is a coal regulator, which was proposed in the T. L. Shankar Committee report. The ministry is expected to table a bill during the winter session of Parliament to set up the regulator.

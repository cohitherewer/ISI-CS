	Calcutta, June 30: Credit growth in the first quarter of the current fiscal is below the expectations of banks.         
	Addressing a seminar of the eastern regional council of Ficci, Corporation Bank chairman and managing director J.M. Garg said,Credit growth in our bank in the first quarter was around 20 per cent, which was below the expected lines. Growth in the same period last year was over 30 per cent.         
	He said banks were still parking huge funds in the reverse repo account with the Reserve Bank of India, which gives them a return of just 3.25 per cent.         
	The banking sector as a whole has over Rs 1,00,000 crore parked in the reverse repo account and Corporation Bank has more than Rs 10,000 crore. We want to lend this money, but there are no borrowers, Garg said.        
	According to Garg, banks cannot reduce deposit rates and lending rates much because the consumer price index (CPI) is in double digit, though the wholesale price index (WPI) has turned negative.         
	Depositors are now getting less than 10 per cent interest on their deposits which means their real interest income is negative, he said.        
	Unless CPI is controlled and food prices brought down, deposit and lending rates cannot be lowered much.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Mills to shell out more for sugarcane
                                                                                                               Mills to shell out more for sugarcane
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          P. Chidambaram in New Delhi on Thursday. (PTI)                                  
	New Delhi, June 25: The government today increased the minimum price that mills will pay to sugarcane farmers by 32 per cent to Rs 107.76 per quintal.         
	The move is expected to increase cane production and curb imports. For the 2008-09 sugar season (October-September), the statutory minimum price (SMP) was Rs 81.18 per quintal.         
	The cabinet committee on economic affairs has approved the revised SMP for the 2009-10 sugar season, home minister P. Chidambaram said here today.        
	According to S.L. Jain, director-general of the Indian Sugar Mills Association, The production of sugarcane should definitely go up compared to last year. But by how much is only a guesswork now because the monsoons progress is very uncertain. A more positive impact, however, could be seen in 2010-11 as farmers might be keen to bring in more area under cane production, Jain said.        
	Sugar prices have risen over 25 per cent since October and are trading at Rs 24-28 per kg. Traders expect the price to remain at that level as there are no fresh supplies. Sugar output is expected to fall to 14.7mt for the production year ended September 30 from 26.3mt last year.        
	Inflation trend        
	Inflation remained in the negative at (-) 1.14 per cent for the week ended June 13, marginally higher than last weeks (-) 1.61 per cent as prices of food items such as pulses, cereals, and fruits and vegetables increased. Analysts said the inflation rate could turn positive earlier than expected because of poor rains.        
	Year-on-year, the prices of cereals went up more than 13.7 per cent, pulses, 17.06 per cent, and fruits and vegetables, 10.22 per cent.

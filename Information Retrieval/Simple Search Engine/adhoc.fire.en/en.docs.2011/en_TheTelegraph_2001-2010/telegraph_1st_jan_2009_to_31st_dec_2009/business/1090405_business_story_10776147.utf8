The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Loan relief for JLR
                                                                                                               Loan relief for JLR
                            
	London, April 4 (PTI): After months of negotiations, Tata Motors-owned Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) is likely to get approval for a 270-million loan (about Rs 2,000 crore) from the European Investment Bank on April 7, a media report today said quoting official sources.        
	According to sources in the department for business, enterprise and regulatory reform, the company has met the criteria for a loan which is likely to be approved by the European Investment Bank board when it meets in Luxembourg next week.        
	Business secretary Lord Mandelson has earmarked 2.3 billion to support the car industry which is mostly made up of loan guarantees as well as direct aid to car makers, the report added.        
	Jaguar Land Rover cut 450 staff in January 2009 and are seeking nearly 300 salaried more redundancies.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Panel formed   to settle disputes
                                                                                                               Panel formed   to settle disputes
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                           Saroj K. Dutta in Mumbai on Sunday. (PTI)                                        
	Mumbai, Sept. 13: Jet Airways limped back to life after a midnight deal between the management and striking pilots under which the two sides will form a consultative body to deal with contentious issues relating to pay and working conditions.         
	The purpose of this newly formed body will be to address every issue that the management and pilots may have on flying-related issues, pay scales and working conditions, Jets executive director Saroj K. Dutta said at a press conference here today.         
	The earlier forum that addressed all issues relating to pilots  the Society for the Welfare of Indian Pilots (SWIP)  will also exist and look after welfare issues. This body will take care of the various aspects of the working of the airline, Dutta said.         
	Pilot representatives are on the consultative body to bring to the managements notice issues they are not aware of. It is a very broad canvas and the body will work out its terms of reference in time, he added.         
	Girish Kaushik, president of the National Aviators Guild (NAG), said, Each organisation or body (the consultative body, NAG and SWIP) will play their roles at the right time. There will be no confusion.         
	The five-day strike at the airline  which forced the cancellation of 1,058 flights over five days  sparked a loss of $2.2 million a day for the already loss-making airline.         
	The two sides played down the brouhaha over the registration of the NAG as a union. They have agreed to let the registrar of unions to decide on the guilds application which has been opposed by the management. Dutta said Jet Airways earned revenues of $8 million a day and flew 23,000 passengers a day.         
	During the initial days of the strike, the booked load positions dropped to 14,000 passengers and, on the last day, this fell to 7,000 passengers. Out of the booked load, almost 60 per cent were diverted to other airlines. Of the rest, 50 per cent were transferred to JetLite. From 23,000 passengers, we came down to nearly 3,000 passengers. We did save some variable costs but these were minimal and the balance of $8 million was lost to the company, the executive director said.         
	Meanwhile, Jet Airways said it planned to raise money through the sale of shares to institutions within the next two to three months.         
	We are planning a domestic issue of shares through a qualified institutional placement to deleverage our balance sheet, increase working capital and strengthen our balance sheet, said K.G. Vishwanath, vice-president, commercial strategy and investor relations. Vishwanath said the company had not decided on the amount it planned to raise or appointed the advisers to the issue.        
	Special fares        
	The company tonight announced a 50 per cent discount on economy class fares across all domestic flights. The tickets will be on sale between September 14 and September 16, and the passengers must avail themselves of the relief by September 18.

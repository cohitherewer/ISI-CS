The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | More suitors queue up for Satyam 
                                                                                                               More suitors queue up for Satyam 
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                            
	Mumbai, March 13: iGATE and a clutch of private equity players, including Kohlberg Kravis and Roberts, Fidelity and Texas Pacific Group, have jumped into the fray to bid for a majority stake in Satyam Computer Services.        
	They will be vying against Larsen amp; Toubro, Spice group and Tech Mahindra that formally announced their interest in the company when the deadline for registration closed yesterday.        
	The private equity players have been less voluble though sources reckon that they are as keen to bid for the 51 per cent stake in Satyam that is on the block through an issue of fresh shares and an open offer to acquire 20 per cent from minority shareholders.        
	The Hyderabad-based software giant today said the process of registration of bidders received adequate response from Indian and international bidders, including private equity firms.        
	Although the exact number of bidders is not known, conservative estimates put it at a dozen at the very least. It isnt known whether the private equity players are bidding on their own or have tied up with a software company.        
	iGATE, the California headquartered company, said it had filed a formal expression of interest in Satyam. The integrated technology and operations company said it expected to receive from Satyam the latest financial statements, including those for the quarter ended December 2008 and the months of January and February 2009, and updated position on liabilities of the company.         
	In the event of iGATE not receiving this information immediately, it has no option but to withdraw its expression of interest, the company added.        
	iGATE was initially interested in acquiring Satyam. CEO Phaneesh Murthy later said the company was withdrawing as many customers had moved out of Satyam and the sale was taking time.        
	Bidders are unlikely to receive the latest financial statements as auditors from KPMG and Deloitte are trawling the accounts dating several years before coming out with a financial restatement. The Satyam stock fell 3.6 per cent to close at Rs 45.50 on the BSE.        
	Meanwhile, Andhra Pradesh High Court today dismissed the application moved by Raju and others against sending them to CBI custody.

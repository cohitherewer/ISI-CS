The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Airline trio run up Rs 1000cr jet fuel dues
                                                                                                               Airline trio run up Rs 1000cr jet fuel dues
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Drained out                                  
	New Delhi, May 5: Three domestic airlines  Kingfisher, Air India and Jet  owe nearly Rs 1,000 crore to oil companies as the cost of jet fuel.         
	Kingfisher is the biggest defaulter. It is still to pay nearly Rs 800 crore to the three oil firms  Indian Oil, HPCL and BPCL.        
	Sources said the airline owed Rs 160 crore to IOC, around Rs 336 crore to HPCL  its largest jet fuel supplier  and Rs 290 crore to BPCL.        
	IOC had recently encashed a Rs 50-crore bank guarantee after a cheque issued by the carrier for its fuel dues bounced. It had put Kingfisher on cash-and-carry about a couple of months back as the airline had failed to make timely payments.        
	This is the first time that bank guarantees given by the airline have been encashed.        
	The sources said Kingfisher had shifted business from one firm to another when asked to pay for the fuel.        
	Jet and Air India owed much less to the oil firms and had provided adequate bank guarantees for the payments that were restructured in October.         
	An IOC spokesperson refused to comment as these were commercial dealings between the airline and the company.        
	Last year, airlines such as Jet, Kingfisher and Air India had defaulted in their payments because of the high cost of jet fuel and had demanded a bailout package from the government.        
	In the bailout package worked out by petroleum minister Murli Deora, civil aviation minister Praful Patel and the airlines, an amount of Rs 2,900 crore had to be paid in six equated monthly instalments by March 2009 without any interest.        
	The oil PSUs agreed to raise the credit time line for the fuel to 90 days from 60 days till the end of 2008-09.         
	They also agreed to revise jet fuel rates every fortnight instead of every 30 days to adjust to volatile international crude prices. Airlines now, however, have to furnish bank guarantees for all fresh jet fuel purchases.        
	With their bottomlines hit by rising costs and shrinking revenues, airlines are in financial trouble.         
	According to estimates, the debt burden of Jet, Kingfisher and Air India is about Rs 30,000 crore.        
	The carriers are struggling to fill up seats amid overcapacity and slowing economic growth that are expected to saddle them with a collective loss of about $2 billion in this fiscal.         
	In 2008, air passenger traffic in India fell after surging for the last six years. The airlines carried 43.3 million passengers in 2007, more than three times the 13.3 million flown in 2002. In 2008, the figure fell to 40.77 million.

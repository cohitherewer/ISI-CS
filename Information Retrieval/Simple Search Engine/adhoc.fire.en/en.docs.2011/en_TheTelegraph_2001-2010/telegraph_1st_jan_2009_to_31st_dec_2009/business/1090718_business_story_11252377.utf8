                                                                                                               TCS profit up 19%
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          S. Ramadorai in Mumbai on Friday. (PTI)                                  
	Mumbai, July 17: Tata Consultancy Services, the countrys largest IT services exporter, today reported a 19 per cent increase in first-quarter net profit at Rs 1,533.94 crore, easily beating analysts estimates by a wide margin.        
	The company had notched up a net profit of Rs 1,290.61 crore in the same period last year.        
	Analysts had expected the company to post a net profit of around Rs 1,270 crore for the quarter ended June 30.        
	The robust performance was achieved in a tough environment for IT companies, which had been grappling with the problems posed by lower spending and pricing pressure.        
	However, the Tata group company saw growth coming from North America and Europe. It said orders had flowed from the banking, financial services and the insurance sectors.         
	TCS said during the quarter, income from operations jumped to Rs 7,206.99 crore from Rs 6,410.70 crore in the same period last year.        
	Though employee costs rose marginally to Rs 2,695.70 crore (Rs 2,284.10 crore), overseas business expenses came down to Rs 1,094.41 crore.        
	S. Ramadorai, CEO and managing director, said the strong performance was achieved because of its focus on operational efficiency.        
	He however, hastened to add that the company continued to remain cautious.        
	The weak economy continues to be a concern for corporate houses. A recovery is not going to happen quickly, Ramadorai said.        
	He said sectors such as manufacturing and telecom continued to be under pressure.        
	By maintaining rigour in pricing deals, managing employee and non-employee costs, collecting and conserving cash and moving work offshore, we have achieved significant improvement in our margins, said S. Mahalingam, chief financial officer and executive director.

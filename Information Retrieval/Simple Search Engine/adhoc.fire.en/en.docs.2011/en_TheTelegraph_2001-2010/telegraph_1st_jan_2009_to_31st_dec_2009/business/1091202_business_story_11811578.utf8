The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Regulated gas price to go up 
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Regulated gas price to go up 
          R. SURYAMURTHY                          Drilling point                                  
	New Delhi, Dec. 1: The Union cabinet may soon take up a proposal to raise the price of gas sold through the administered price mechanism (APM) by 33 per cent.        
	However, the move can face resistance from the fertiliser and power ministries as this will hike the input costs of companies under their wings.         
	The petroleum ministry has circulated a cabinet note to raise prices from $1.8 per million British thermal unit (mBtu) to $2.4. Eventually, it wants the price to be at $4.2 per mBtu, which is the one recommended by the empowered group of ministers for Reliance Industries gas from Krishna-Godavari.        
	APM gas makes up around 40 per cent of Indias production of 140 million standard cubic metres a day (mmscmd), or 55.6 mmscmd. They come from the fields of Oil and Natural Gas Corporation Limited and Oil India Limited, which the duo had received from the government on a nomination basis.        
	The hike is a step towards reducing distortions in a market having more than a dozen rates, officials said.        
	Sources said the fertiliser ministry could oppose the move as it would increase the subsidy burden, which is already at Rs 50,000 crore for this fiscal.        
	Power ministry sources said the hike would result in a hike in tariff. Electricity costs in states such as Gujarat, Delhi, Andhra Pradesh and Tamil Nadu will go up by 20 paise per unit.        
	NTPC Limited, which accounts for 24 per cent of the countrys gas-based power generation capacity, gets 63 per cent of gas through APM        
	Sources said the company would try to increase the plant load factor to manage the higher costs, which should keep a tariff hike to a minimum level.         
	ONGC, officials said, will gain nearly Rs 2,000 crore annually if the price is raised to $2.40 per mBtu. The last price revision was done in June 2006.        
	ONGC produces 49.6 mmscmd of the 55 mmscmd gas under APM; the rest comes from OIL.        
	Iran deal        
	ONGC today signed agreements to pick up a stake in a giant gasfield and a LNG plant in Iran, which also awarded the rights to develop a gas discovery it made in the Persian Gulf two years ago.        
	ONGC Videsh Ltd and Hinduja Group signed agreements to take a 40 per cent interest in the $7.5 billion, Phase 12 of the gigantic South Pars gasfield, Irans deputy oil minister and managing director of National Iranian Oil Co Seifollah Jashnsaz said.

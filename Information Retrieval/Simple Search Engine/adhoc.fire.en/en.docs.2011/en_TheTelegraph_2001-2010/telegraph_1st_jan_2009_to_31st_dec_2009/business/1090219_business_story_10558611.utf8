          SOUNAK MITRA                          Success story                                  
	Calcutta, Feb. 18: City-based Linc Pen amp; Plastics Ltd is planning to raise capacity to 5 million pieces per day by 2011-12 to meet the growing demand for export.         
	The company currently produces 2.5 million pens a day at its two manufacturing facilities at Serakole and Falta in Bengal.        
	We are now focusing on exports and trying to get into newer markets in East Asia such as Malaysia and the Philippines, managing director Deepak Jalan said.         
	The company will invest about Rs 20 crore in capacity expansion. The leading export markets of the company are the US, the UK and the Saarc countries, including Myanmar.        
	Linc, which reported exports of Rs 38 crore in 2007-08, aims to touch the Rs 50-crore mark in 2009-10.         
	This year, we hope to maintain the figure we registered last year. Though we targeted at least 20 per cent growth in exports this year, because of the global economic meltdown, exports in the last two quarters have fallen substantially, he said.        
	Linc is a registered brand in 30 countries and has applied for registration in 20 more countries this year.         
	Jalan said Linc might miss its targeted turnover of Rs 200 crore this financial year because of the recession. But, we hope to recover next year with the new markets, he said.         
	Linc reported Rs 174-crore turnover in 2007-08.        
	The company also aims to capture a 15 per cent share of the Indian writing instrument market by 2010.         
	The size of the industry is estimated at Rs 2,000 crore, with unorganised firms having a 25 per cent share.

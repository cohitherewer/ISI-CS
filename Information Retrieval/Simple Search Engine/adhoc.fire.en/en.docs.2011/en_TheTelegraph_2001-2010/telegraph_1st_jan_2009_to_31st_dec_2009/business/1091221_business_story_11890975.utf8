	Calcutta, Dec. 20: Domestic wine makers are promoting their vineyards as tourist spots.        
	On a tour to a vineyard, visitors can witness the process of making wine  from crushing and fermentation to racking and bottling. This is followed by offers of cheese platters along with wine. There are facilities for night stay, with a wine spa and wine tasting rooms as add-ons.        
	According to reports, the wineries of Californias Napa Valley attract around 5 million visitors every year.         
	In India, vineyards are mostly concentrated in and around Nashik, Maharashtra.        
	Dindori has 25 wineries and more are in the offing, with majors such as Diageo and Seagram announcing their expansion plans. Gangapur, home to Sula Wines, and Niphad and Pimpalgaon also hold promise.        
	The UB group is developing its winery at Baramati, as a tourist spot. By March, we will be able to offer full facilities to tourists, Sanjay Roy, senior general manager (sales and marketing) of United Spirits, told The Telegraph.        
	The group is planning to invest Rs 100 crore in wine tourism in 2009-10. Some of the new attractions include vine therapy, beauty products, fun sessions and wine tasting sessions. The project is expected to be launched by June this year, Roy said.        
	Nashik-based wine manufacturer Valle de Vin is planning to set up a spa at an investment of Rs 10 crore in 2010 at its winery at Sanjegaon near Nashik, company director Neeraj Deorah told The Telegraph. Deepak Roy-owned Valle de Vin markets Zampa wines.        
	Niphad-based Vintage Wines director Yatin Patil said, We have tied up with a tour operator and will start the tours in the coming season, by which time our wine bar will also be ready. Our guest rooms will be done in the second phase, in a couple of years.        
	Wine tourism is a $15-billion industry, globally.

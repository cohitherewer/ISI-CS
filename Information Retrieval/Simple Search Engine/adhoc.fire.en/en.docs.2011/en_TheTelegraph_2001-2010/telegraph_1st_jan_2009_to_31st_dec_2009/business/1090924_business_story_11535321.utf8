The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Uncertainty drags down Airtel scrip 
                                                                                                               Uncertainty drags down Airtel scrip 
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                            
	Mumbai, Sept. 23: Shares of Bharti Airtel came under pressure because of growing uncertainty over its proposed deal with MTN.         
	On the BSE, Bharti fell 3.43 per cent to Rs 413.40 against the previous close of Rs 428.10. The scrip opened at Rs 424 and hit an intra-day low of Rs 410.60.        
	While market observers are awaiting clarity both on the deal and the norms announced by Sebi, they do admit that yesterdays development does complicate matters for the two entities.        
	However, brokerage Anand Rathi Securities believes Sebis decision is unlikely to be a deal breaker. The brokerage said if MTN wanted voting rights for all the GDRs, it would have to make an open offer. This would result in MTN facing a significant financing burden.        
	If MTN does not insist on voting rights for all GDRs, then Bharti can make a preferential GDR allotment, of which only 14.99 per cent come with voting rights and the rest do not. This would be in MTNs interest in our view, the brokerage said.        
	The MTN scrip is trading at 126.35 rand, up 0.68 per cent in late afternoon trade on the JSE today.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Sony eyes higher turnover 
                                                                                                               Sony eyes higher turnover 
          GARIMA SINGH NEOGY                          Tamagawa: Growth focus                                  
	New Delhi, Aug. 1: Sony India hopes to earn a turnover of Rs 4,000 crore this fiscal. The Japanese company is also looking at employing Indian professionals to manage key portfolios.        
	We are targeting a growth of 21 per cent in turnover this fiscal over Rs 3,300 crore in 2008-09, said Masaru Tamagawa, managing director of Sony India.        
	He said the companys growth last fiscal suffered due to currency fluctuations. Going forward, the company will expand in terms of product offerings, but will remain more or less in the same categories that we are present in today. We will not venture into new categories at the moment, said Tamagawa.        
	Sonys key product growth categories in the Indian market are LCD television sets, digital cameras, MP3 players, notebooks and game consoles.        
	Sharing the companys overall growth plans, Tamagawa said Sony planned to employ Indian professionals to manage their key divisions in India. The company has about 700 employees in India.        
	First, we will increase our headcount by 5 per cent this year and then move to a strategy where our key divisions are handled by India professionals, he said. Asked if Sony was planning to set up a manufacturing facility in India, he said the company had no such plans.        
	Tamagawa had earlier said that a complex tax structure and lack of electronic component vendors in India were preventing the company from setting up a manufacturing facility in India. We have no such investment plans. But the company will spend Rs 200 crore on marketing, said Tamagawa.        
	Sony Indias marketing expense is same as last year. The global recession has forced the parent company to tighten promotion expenses across the globe.        
	At present, Sony India is the second largest contributor (in terms of revenues) to Sony worldwide in the Asia-Pacific region. China is the largest contributor.        
	As for Sony Indias contribution to Sony worldwide, Tamagawa said it was the second largest contributor after China in the Asia-Pacific region. China contributes nearly three times more than India, he said.        
	Asked about the profitability of the company, he refused to divulge the numbers saying, Our income statement and balance sheet are very healthy.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          CESC vice-chairman Sanjiv Goenka in Calcutta on Friday. A Telegraph picture                                  
	Calcutta, July 24: Bengals two leading industry houses  ITC and CESC  are unable to start their new projects for want of land.        
	The two companies need only around 40 acres each, much less than what the steel, petrochemical and automobile firms are looking for in the state. While CESCs power plant is stuck in Haldia, ITC cannot proceed with its food processing factory near Sankrail because of litigation.        
	We are ready to tie up the finances and arrange a lead vendor for the project. However, this land is a must, Sanjiv Goenka, vice-chairman of CESC, said after the companys annual general meeting today.        
	ITC chairman Y.C. Deveshwar could not hide his disappointment either. The state government has done its bit. But the land they earmarked has now got litigated. If ITC, which has its headquarters in Calcutta, cant set up a plant here, its very sad, he said.        
	The delay faced by CESC in setting up the Haldia plant may affect power supply in the state, and Calcutta in particular. The proposed 2x300MW units will be catering to the city and is expected to reduce the demand-supply mismatch.        
	Peak demand in the city is around 1,500MW, while CESC generates around 950MW.        
	While Goenka did not elaborate, it is learnt that administrative hurdles delayed the transfer of land, which is with the Haldia Development Authority (HDA). The defeat of former HDA chairman and CPM strongman Laxman Seth in the Lok Sabha polls has created an impasse. After his defeat, Seth was stripped from the chairmanship of the HDA.        
	CESC is ready to start its 250MW unit at Budge Budge. The company has also been shortlisted for taking up power distribution in Patna.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | CLB vows quick approval for sale
                                                                                                               CLB vows quick approval for sale
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                                            
	New Delhi, April 13: The Satyam board is likely to get approval for the 31 per cent stake sale to Tech Mahindra within 24 hours of filing for consent, the Company Law Board (CLB) said.         
	The approval should not take more than 24 hours after submission of the affidavit, said S. Balasubramanian, chairman of the CLB.         
	The quasi-judicial body expects fraud-hit Satyam Computer Services to file for approval within two to three days.        
	Satyam chairman Kiran Karnik said a change of management at Satyam was expected to take place by the next weekend after the board gets approval from the CLB.        
	Tech Mahindra, a Mahindra amp; Mahindra-promoted company, has won the bid for Satyam Computer after bidding at Rs 58 per share.         
	Tech Mahindra would pay Rs 1,757 crore for a 31 per cent stake in Satyam.         
	Tech Mahindra has to make an open offer within four days of getting CLB approval.         
	It will run Satyam as an independent company with separate liabilities.        
	Three months ago, Satyams former chairman Ramalinga Raju shocked investors by saying that he had overstated profits for years, putting in doubt the survival of the company once ranked as the fourth largest outsourcing firm.        
	The government quickly stepped in and suspended the board as it sought to limit damage from Indias biggest corporate scandal.

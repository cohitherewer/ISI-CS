                                I wish to invest in gold ETFs. Is a demat account necessary for this? If yes, please tell me how to open this? How to redeem the units? Please explain which investment is better from the security point of view ETFs or gold funds?          Sanjit Kumar Sen, Khidderpore
                    A gold exchange traded fund (ETF) is a financial instrument like a mutual fund and the value per ETF unit depends on the price of gold at any given point in time. However, unlike a mutual fund scheme, the units of a gold ETF can be purchased or sold only through a stock exchange. To do so, one needs to have a demat account and a brokerage account. You can approach your bank for opening a demat account. These days almost all commercial banks are offering this service. The risk and return profiles of ETFs and gold funds that invest in equities of gold mining and gold processing companies are very different. ETFs track the movements in prices of physical gold in the international as well as domestic markets. Hence, the return from investment in gold ETFs will be similar to investment in physical gold. But investments in equities of gold mining and processing companies through a gold fund involves higher risks. Such investments are related to the individual companies, the geo-political situation of the country where the company is operating, foreign exchange risk of the currency of the country and so on.                                   Form logic      I invested Rs 50,000 in a diversified equity mutual fund. In which column of the income tax return form should I show this investment? When I invested the money the net asset value of the scheme was Rs 44.83. At what NAV could I get Rs 1 lakh on redemption?        Swapan Biswas, Khidderpore 
                    vestments are not required to be shown in the income tax return form unless the same is disposed of with a loss or gain. Income tax return forms deal with cash/income flows. If there is a loss or gain from investment, it has to be shown in the income tax form in the column specified for short-term or long-term nature of the capital gain. When the NAV of the fund is Rs 91.68, your redemption value of units will be Rs 1 lakh.                                      If you have any queries about investing or taxes or a high-cost purchase you are planning, mail to: btgraphabpmail.com, or write to: Business Telegraph, 6 Prafulla Sarkar Street, Calcutta 700 001.

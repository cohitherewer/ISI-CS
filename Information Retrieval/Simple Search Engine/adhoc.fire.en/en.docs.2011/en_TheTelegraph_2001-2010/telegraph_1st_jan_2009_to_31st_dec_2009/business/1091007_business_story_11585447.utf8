	Calcutta, Oct. 6: Bengal is yet to find an anchor investor for the proposed auto park at Guptamani near Kharagpur.        
	The turmoil in the global automobile industry has certainly affected each and every project across the world. The market is recovering and we hope to get an anchor investor soon, Sumanta Chaudhuri, chief executive officer of the West Bengal Industrial Infrastructure Development Corporation (WBIIDC), said here today on the sidelines of a CII seminar on infrastructure.        
	WBIIDC and Bengal Srei Infrastructure Development Ltd have formed a joint venture  Bengal Integrated Auto Park Ltd  to develop the auto park over 500 acres of land at Guptamani. The park will also house an auto SEZ over 250 acres.         
	While an anchor investor is yet to be tied up, the developers of the park are still in the process of land acquisition.         
	It would take a few more months to complete, Chaudhuri said.

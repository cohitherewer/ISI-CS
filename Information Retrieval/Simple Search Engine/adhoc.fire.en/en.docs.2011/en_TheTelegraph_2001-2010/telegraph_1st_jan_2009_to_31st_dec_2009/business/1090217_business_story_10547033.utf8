                                                                                                               Govt sees 7% growth next fiscal
          OUR BUREAU                                            
	Feb. 16: The Congress-led UPA government expects the economy to grow at 7 per cent next year  at least that is the assumption on the basis of which it has drawn up all its forecasts in the interim budget.        
	A six-page document  called the Medium Term Fiscal Policy Statement  says that real GDP growth (at constant 1999-2000 prices) will moderate to 7.1 per cent in 2008-09.         
	This means that GDP growth this year will be 2 percentage points off the 9.1 per cent achieved in 2007-08.        
	But as the recession deepens in the advanced economies this year, the government clearly doesnt expect it to rub off on India.         
	Due to the prevailing uncertainty in the world economy, real GDP growth has been assumed at 7 per cent in 2009-10, says the document.        
	It adds that after factoring in inflation expectations, GDP growth (at current market prices) for 2009-10 is assumed at 11 per cent. It estimates the size of the Indian economy  again at current prices  at Rs 60,21,426 crore in 2009-10.        
	The government expects real GDP growth to clamber back to 9 per cent by 2011-12. The document indicates that the government intends to take its eye off the tough fiscal and revenue deficit targets in 2009-10.         
	Pranab Mukherjee indicated as much in his budget speech: Our government decided to relax the FRBM (Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management) targets in order to provide the much needed demand boost to counter the situation created by the global financial meltdown.        
	Mukherjee did go on to say that the medium-term objective must be to revert to the path of fiscal consolidation at the earliest.        
	He didnt say when that might be but the six-page document seems to indicate that the timeout will be pretty short  probably a year.         
	The process of fiscal consolidation is expected to be back on track from 2010-11, it says.

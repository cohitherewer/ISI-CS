The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | New compact cars rev up component firms 
                                                                                                               New compact cars rev up component firms 
          GARIMA SINGH NEOGY                                              ON TRACK      
	New Delhi, April 26: Foreign car companies plans to make compact models in the country are expected to improve the fortunes of the local component makers.        
	Companies such as Toyota, Volkswagen (VW), Ford, BMW and Skoda want to launch small cars in the domestic market first and then export them. Firms can keep the prices competitive by using local components.         
	If manufacturers plan to develop new platforms for their plants in India, it means good business for component makers. This will not only get them more work, but will also allow them to participate in a high level of value creation, said Vishnu Mathur, president of the Auto Component Manufacturers Association.        
	European car major VW plans to roll out the hatchback version of the Polo by March 2010. A company official said VW India was keen to source 70-80 per cent of the auto parts locally for the Polo.         
	Such a strategy would not only bring down the overall cost of the vehicle but also help keep the running cost modest, he said.         
	Skoda Auto India  part of the Volkswagen group will begin production of the Fabia from June. The firm is betting big on local component makers for the Rs 3-lakh car to lower the cost of production.         
	We source components from the local vendors and are looking to take this up to over 50 per cent in the next two years, said Thomas Kuehl, member, board of directors (sales and marketing), Skoda India. At present, around five per cent of the Fabias components are sourced locally.        
	Most component manufacturers believe that the market has bottomed out and an upswing is on the cards. There is a feeling that the worst has probably passed. However, we are working on operating plans that also factor in severe fluctuations in the market, said Arvind Balaji, joint managing director of Lucas-TVS.

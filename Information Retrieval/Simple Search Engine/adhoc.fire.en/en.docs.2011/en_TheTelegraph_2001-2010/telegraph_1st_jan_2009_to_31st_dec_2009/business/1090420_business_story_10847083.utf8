The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Reverse repo funds cap in air 
                                                                                                               Reverse repo funds cap in air

	Mumbai, April 19: The Reserve Bank of India in its credit policy on Tuesday can fix a limit on the cash parked with it by banks via the reverse repo window, bankers said.        
	However, bankers are divided over the prospects of another round of cuts in the central banks key policy rates  the repo and reverse repo.        
	The repo is the rate at which the RBI lends money to banks against government securities. The reverse repo is the rate at which it mops up funds from banks. The funds are for the short term in both the instances.        
	On the cash reserve ratio (CRR) there is unanimity among them on an unchanged rate as there is ample liquidity in the system. CRR  the proportion of deposits which banks must maintain with the RBI  is now at 5 per cent.                   
	Since October last year, the RBI has brought down the repo rate by 400 basis points to 5 per cent and the reverse repo rate by 250 basis points to 3.5 per cent.        
	Bankers in favour of an unchanged repo and reverse repo say there is sufficient cash in the system for borrowing, and banks have already brought down their lending and deposit rates in response to the RBI measures.         
	Therefore, there is no compelling case for a rate cut, Rupa Rege Nitsure, chief economist at Bank of Baroda, told The Telegraph. Another banker said the RBI would prefer to hold its fire for another day.        
	Those in favour of a 25-50 basis point cut in the repo and reverse repo rates say the central bank is keen on a proactive role to propel growth.         
	Falling inflation, now at just 0.18 per cent, will also give the RBI room for cuts.        
	We expect the RBI to cut its repo and reverse repo rates by 25 basis points as a signalling tool to reiterate its pro-growth stance, the HDFC Bank said in a recent note.        
	A reduction in the key short-term rates would result in both private and nationalised banks lowering their lending rates further, a senior official from a private bank said. However, in the case of a status quo, bankers are unlikely to revise their interest rates.        
	Analysts expect RBI governor Duvvuri Subbarao to ask banks to increase their lending to industry to revive the stuttering economy.         
	While the nationalised banks have responded to the RBIs aggressive rate cuts by bringing down their lending rates, private players seem reluctant.        
	It is now being increasingly felt that there may be a cap on the amount that banks can park with the central bank under its reverse repo window. The move is aimed at encouraging banks to lend more to individuals and firms.        
	Banks have been putting more than Rs 1 lakh crore daily at the reverse repo window. The RBI may bring a ceiling here so that banks do not park their funds with it and instead lend it to the corporate sector, said a treasury chief from a private sector bank who did not wish to be identified.

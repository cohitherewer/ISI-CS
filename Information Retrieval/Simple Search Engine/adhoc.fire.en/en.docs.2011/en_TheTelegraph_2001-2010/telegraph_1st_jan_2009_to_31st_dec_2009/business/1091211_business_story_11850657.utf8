	Calcutta, Dec. 10: Andrew Yule has exited Phoenix Yule after realising almost five times its initial investment in the conveyor belt subsidiary.        
	Yule earned Rs 62.82 crore from selling its 26 per cent stake to foreign partner Phoenix AG of Germany; it had invested Rs 11.94 crore just over a decade ago.        
	In the interim period, from 1998, when Yule hived off the belt division into the joint venture, it also received a dividend of Rs 2 crore. It is a good payback, Kallol Datta, chairman and managing director of public sector Andrew Yule, said.        
	Phoenix Yule will use the Yule name for the next five years and pay a royalty of Rs 2.4 crore to Andrew Yule. The PSU is also getting Rs 1.3 crore for a non-compete fee.        
	Claus-Peter Spille, head of products in Continental ContiTech Germany, the holding company of Phoenix, said India was a big market and with full ownership, their business would only grow.        
	T.K. Mukherjee, managing director of Phoenix Yule India, said the company would clock Rs 270 crore net sales this time against Rs 290 crore in 2008.        
	Phoenix Yules only plant is located in Kalyani, Bengal, and employs around 450 people.        
	In the Lok Sabha today, the government said it had started the disinvestment process for Andrew Yules stake in Tide Water Oil and expected to wind up the process within a year.

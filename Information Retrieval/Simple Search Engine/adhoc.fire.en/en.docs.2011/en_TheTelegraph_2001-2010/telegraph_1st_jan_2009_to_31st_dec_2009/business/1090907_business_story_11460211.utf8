The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Firms keen to use 3G spectrum for voice call
                                                                                                               Firms keen to use 3G spectrum for voice call

	New Delhi, Sept. 6: Third-generation (3G) spectrum, enabling high-speed Internet and data services, will be initially used to meet the spectrum crunch faced by telecom companies.        
	Operators will use the highly efficient 3G spectrum to provide improved voice calls to customers, and not just data services. Voice services account for more than 85 per cent of a companys revenues.         
	With the department of telecom (DoT) refusing to allocate additional 2G spectrum, operators are finding it difficult to accommodate the huge surge in subscribers on the limited radiowaves (spectrum) available to them. More than 17 million subscribers are being added each month.         
	Operators will either have to invest in setting up cell sites to better utilise the available spectrum or allow the quality of voice services to deteriorate.         
	Industry players said diverting a significant part of 3G spectrum towards high revenue earning voice services was an option worth considering. We will be investing in buying 3G spectrum. So, it makes more sense to direct it in areas, such as voice, where it can start generating revenues immediately, said an executive of a leading GSM firm.         
	The DoT is relying on the defence forces to vacate around 5 megahertz of 2G spectrum, which will reduce the shortage to a great extent. However, defence can allot spectrum for civilian use only after the optic fibre network becomes functional.         
	While 3G will ultimately be used for data services, initially operators will use it to mitigate the current spectrum crunch, said Mahesh Uppal, director at telecom consulting firm Com First.         
	Analysts said there was no ready demand for 3G services. Both the operators and the customers need to understand the potential of the high-speed data services.         
	Finally, 3G data market is where the action is going to be, especially in rural areas. However, it could take around five years before the full revenue potential is realised, said Sudipto Basu, an independent telecom analyst.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | PM sees scope for cheaper loans   Key sectors show signs of revival
                                                                                                               PM sees scope for cheaper loans
   Key sectors show signs of revival
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Prime Minister Manmohan Singh with Tata group chairman Ratan Tata and Bharti Enterprises chairman Sunil Bharti Mittal in New Delhi on Saturday. (PTI)                                        
	New Delhi, March 28: Prime Minister Manmohan Singh feels there is room for a further cut in interest rates as liquidity is adequate and inflation is ruling low.        
	Speaking to corporate bosses, Singh said there were encouraging signs in some sectors of the economy.        
	With ample liquidity and low inflation, there is perhaps scope for a further moderation in interest rates, Singh said while discussing the performance of the economy with industrialists before his departure for the G-20 meet in London next week.        
	While public sector banks have reduced the prime lending rates in the last three months between 150 basis points and 200 basis points, other scheduled commercial banks are yet to respond in equal measure, he said.        
	Singhs statement comes at a time when bureaucrats and bankers are engaged in an animated debate on the scope for reduction in interest rates.        
	Only yesterday, cabinet secretary K.M. Chandrasekhar slammed banks for failing to trim interest rates. He said banks, particularly the private ones, had not cut rates to the desired extent following the easing of the monetary policy by the Reserve Bank of India.        
	Since October, the RBI has cut its key lending rate by 400 basis points and the government has cut duties and service tax rates to spur growth and protect jobs.         
	But commercial banks have been reluctant to lend because of increased risk aversion.        
	RBI governor Duvvuri Subbarao, too, had wondered why lending rates were not coming down in response to its incentives. The Indian Banks Association, however, had ruled out rate cuts.         
	The 125-basis-point reduction in bank interest rates is not commensurate with the 400-basis-point cut that we have seen in the repo rate. If interest rates cannot be brought down across the board, then the government can perhaps consider offering interest subvention to sectors like automobiles, housing and consumer durables, Harshpati Singhania, president of Ficci, said.        
	Indias growth is likely to be below 7 per cent in 2008-09 against 9 per cent or more in the previous years as the global slowdown hurts key sectors.        
	But Singh said auto, steel, cement and farm were showing some signs of revival. The auto sector after a difficult patch seems to be showing signs of recovery. Foodgrain production for 2008-09 is likely to be in excess of 228 million tonnes, he said.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      Parekh in Mumbai on Wednesday. (PTI)                          
	Mumbai, Jan. 21: Investigations into the accounting fraud by the promoters of Satyam Computer Services have revealed that some of the documents were forged.         
	It is obvious that some of the papers that we have seen were forged, Deepak Parekh, a member of the newly formed Satyam board, told reporters at an event organised by the Confederation of Indian Industry, here.         
	The six-member board, that will meet on Thursday, will also decide on an investment banker that could find a suitor for the company.         
	At present, the company was busy retaining international clients and considering ways to raise funds, Parekh added.         
	Calling independent directors an endangered species, Parekh said, Very often the old schoolboy network comes in handy while choosing independent directors but Indian companies are now giving up that practice.         
	The bane of corporate governance in India has always been the selection of independent directors. This has often led to choosing the known devil, but it limits the skill set of the board. Independent directors also get stressed out by serving on too many boards and are often unable to do complete justice to their roles, he said.         
	Parekh also proposed a nominating committee that would choose such directors and plan in advance for vacancies.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                            
	Mumbai, Sept. 14: The dollar deluge is expected to start again.        
	Foreign fund inflows into India are on the rise a year after the demise of Lehman Brothers and the ensuing turmoil in the markets across the world.        
	Foreign direct investment  an indicator several economists prefer to FII inflows as they are less volatile  picked up in July. Other foreign fund inflows such as foreign institutional investor (FII) money, private equity investments and cross-border mergers and acquisitions dont exactly tell the same story.        
	According to the Reserve Bank of India bulletin for September, FDI inflows touched $3.5 billion in July, up 55 per cent from a year ago. In the April-July period this year, FDI inflows totalled $10.49 billion. The numbers look encouraging compared with FII flows, which stood at $10.29 billion during the period.         
	The trend for FDI is going to improve as industry is getting competitive and there is a structural shift upwards. Everybody overdid the panic and even though there is a certain amount of caution, the real economy is recovering faster than expected, said Surjit Bhalla, chairman of Oxus Investments, an economic research and portfolio management company.         
	That may be true and the FII numbers look fairly optimistic especially as the BSE sensex hit a 15-month high recently. Several global brokerage houses are optimistic about the prospects in the Indian stock markets. However, some experts are uncertain about the quality of the FII money coming into the country.         
	FII inflows are still not very strong and more importantly, FII data are fairly opaque. What is the source of this money? Is it coming in from Mauritius, Bahamas or US pension funds? Are these long-term investors or fly-by-night operators? asks Prithvi Haldea of Prime Database.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Bankers glued to CRR trend

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                             
	Mumbai, Oct. 25: Bankers and economists do not expect Reserve Bank of India governor Duvvuri Subbarao to raise short-term interest rates when the central banks mandarins hunker down to review the monetary policy on Tuesday.         
	However, they seem to be split on whether Subbarao will signal a tightening of the policy by starting to soak up excess liquidity within the system by raising the cash reserve ratio (CRR).         
	Subbarao has been increasingly vocal about the dilemma that the RBI faces as it deliberates on the timing of the withdrawal of its accommodative monetary policy that was put in place in October 2008 when the effects of global recession started to be felt in India.         
	A tighter monetary policy could scupper the growth momentum in the economy, which is projected to grow at 6.5 per cent this year. At the same time, there is a growing concern that inflation can start surging in the later part of the year after a poor monsoon and rising food prices.         
	Inflation based on the wholesale price index nudged up to 1.21 per cent during the week ended October 10 against 0.91 per cent in the preceding week.         
	Last year, the RBI had started to pump in money into the financial system by slashing interest rates and lowering CRR at a time when growth started to stutter with companies finding it hard to raise cheap money abroad.         
	CRR is that portion of bank deposits that must be maintained with the RBI. The repo is the rate at which the central bank provides short-term cash to banks; the reverse repo is the rate at which the RBI borrows money from banks.         
	The reduction in CRR released Rs 1,60,000 crore into the system. Along with other measures, the RBI has injected Rs 5,61,700 crore so far.         
	Inflation fear        
	Some bankers feel the RBI can raise CRR by 25 to 50 basis points as there is excess money sloshing about the system, which has started to stoke inflation  which is re-emerging as a major bugbear for the central bank.         
	Moodys economy.com, the research arm of Moodys, expects a 50 basis point hike in CRR. In a recent note, it said a CRR hike would remove the excess liquidity that had been created because of strong liquidity flows and a surge in deposits with banks.         
	However, others reckon that the central bank will not take such a decisive step just yet, arguing that inflation has started to inch up largely because of supply-side pressures.         
	The RBI will, therefore, wait for demand pressures to emerge; only then will it start raising CRR, said a treasury chief with a foreign bank who did not wish to be identified. He believes that a CRR hike will take place only in December or early next year.         
	The RBI has been sending out conflicting signals. Subbarao said recently that India might have to tighten monetary policy sooner than the developed countries as inflationary pressures had started to build up in the economy. But soon after, he said the unwinding might have to wait till growth in the economy kicked in.         
	Growth concerns warrant a delayed exit, but inflation concerns call for an earlier exit. An early exit on inflation concerns runs the risk of derailing the fragile growth, while a delayed exit may engender inflation expectations, Subbarao recently said, highlighting the challenge that the central bank was facing.         
	Price nitty-gritty        
	Abheek Barua, chief economist at HDFC Bank, expects Subbarao to maintain status quo on Tuesday. He reckons that while high inflation is worrisome, it is largely confined to food and other agricultural items.         
	 Food inflation is known to breed broader inflation expectations and have a second round impact on other, core items. It hasnt spilled over yet and that means that the RBI can wait a little longer before moving, especially since there are equally strong concerns about whether the current economic recovery will sustain, he said.         
	There is, however, a broad consensus among analysts that the RBI is likely to voice its growing concern on inflation.         
	At its first quarter review of monetary policy, the central bank had projected WPI inflation for end-March 2010 at 5 per cent. Analysts do not rule out the possibility of this forecast being revised upwards.         
	Bond limit        
	Bankers also hope that Subbarao will help them tidy up their books by raising the limit on held-to-maturity category of bonds that they hold as part of their investments. The present cap on this segment is 25 per cent of a banks deposits. They expect this to be raised to 27 per cent.         
	One reason for this is the aggressive government borrowing programme this year. The government has so far sold bonds worth Rs 3.15 trillion since April.         
	However, 10-year bond yields  a benchmark rate  have fallen about 140 basis points from a year ago to a little over 7.4 per cent.

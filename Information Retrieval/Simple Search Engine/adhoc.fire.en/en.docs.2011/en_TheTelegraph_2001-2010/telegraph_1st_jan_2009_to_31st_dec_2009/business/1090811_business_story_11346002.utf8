                                                                                                               Trade policy to shower goodies on exporters
										      OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                Commerce minister Anand Sharma (right) with CII president Venu Srinivasan in New Delhi on Monday. (PTI)      
	New Delhi, Aug. 10: The UPA government plans to offer incentives to explore new markets and develop products in its foreign trade policy to be unveiled later this month.  
	We will talk to the finance ministry on stimulus for the export sector. We will announce more stimulus in the trade policy this month, commerce minister Anand Sharma said.        
	According to Sharma, the sharp fall in exports may have been arrested in recent months.        
	Sharma, who chaired a Board of Trade (BoT) meeting here today, said, We hope that after consultations with the finance minister, we will be able to provide more encouragement to exporters, possibly in the new policy.        
	The stimulus measures will focus on labour-intensive industries such as gems and jewellery, textiles, leather, and handicrafts.         
	Exports in these segments have been contracting since October last year.        
	Ficci president Harsh Pati Singhania, CII head Venu Srinivasan, A. Sakthivel, chief of the Federation of Indian Export Organisations, and heads of export promotion councils attended the meeting to express their views on the difficulties faced by them in the recession-hit markets of the developed world.        
	The BoT, headed by Anand Sharma, has industrialists such as Anand Mahindra, Azim Premji and Y.C. Deveshwar as its members. It is the governments apex advisory body on exports and imports.        
	Officials said the focus of the trade policy would be to encourage penetration into new markets.         
	The European Union accounts for 36 per cent of the total exports by India, the US, 16-17 per cent and Japan, 15-16 per cent.         
	Any slowdown in these economies, thus, adversely affects exports.        
	The trade policy will contain a mix of fiscal incentives and simplified procedures. The government may announce some new measures, while deciding to continue certain others, officials said.

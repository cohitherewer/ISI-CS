	Calcutta, July 29: The worst may be over for steel companies, but the path of recovery will be a slow and strenuous one.        
	ArcelorMittal, the worlds largest steel maker, today reported its third consecutive quarterly loss, while Tata Steel announced a 47 per cent drop in profits at its Indian operations.        
	According to Lakshmi N. Mittal, the Indian-born steel czar, the last six months have been the most challenging for the industry. In recent weeks, we have started seeing some initial signs of recovery. We are now planning to restart production at some facilities, Mittal said, after announcing a $0.8-billion loss.        
	Talking to The Telegraph from Luxembourg, an ArcelorMittal executive said the environment continued to be bad and the pace of recovery would be slow. The company is operating at 50 per cent of its capacity but has decided to ignite the blast furnaces in France, Brazil and Spain.        
	Prices have risen $100 a tonne in the US, while Europe is seeing an increase of 30 euros per tonne. ArcelorMittal has increased production by 5 per cent.         
	Destocking (using up of inventory) has been completed in all the major markets where we are seeing an increased demand. This is a positive sign, but it should be kept in context. We are not yet seeing any major improvements in terms of real demand, which is still expected to be down by 10 per cent at the global level for 2009 (but significantly more in developed world). We expect demand to continue at a slow and progressive rate, the executive said. The market is better in India where demand is good, but prices remain low.        
	Tata Steel, Indias biggest steel company, sold 22 per cent more in the second quarter though revenue dropped 8.7 per cent compared with the corresponding quarter of the previous year, underlining the sharp drop in prices.         
	Hooghly Met Coke        
	Tata Steel has decided to merge Haldia-based Hooghly Met Coke with itself after the West Bengal Industrial Development Corporation sold its 5 per cent stake in the company        
	The company has also deposited Rs 25 crore with the State Bank of India for the revival of Indian Cable Company.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Rupee hits five-month high of 46.98
                                                                                                               Rupee hits five-month high of 46.98
          OUR BUREAU                                            
	Mumbai, May 22: The rupee continued its upward march for the sixth consecutive day. It breached the crucial 47-level against the US currency for the first time after December 19, 2008, on a sliding dollar in the overseas markets.         
	The rupee also drew support from encouraging trends in local stocks and continued optimism about faster reforms in the financial sector, paving the way for increased capital inflows.        
	At the Interbank Foreign Exchange (forex) market, the domestic currency resumed stronger at 47.20 a dollar from its previous close of 47.38 a dollar and later hit a five-month high of 46.98 against the US currency. It, however, pared gains and was quoted at 47.15 a dollar in late morning trade. Forex dealers said a weak dollar overseas provided a fresh impetus to the Indian currency.         
	The dollar fell to its recent lows against the basket of currencies on fears about the US losing its AAA rating. The dealers said the rupee trimmed its gains because of some dollar buying by banks, probably on behalf of oil companies.        
	TCS view        
	Software firm Tata Consultancy Services today said further strengthening of the rupee against the dollar was a possibility in the months ahead, but the topline of the company would not be affected unless it appreciated to 42-43 level.        
	Over a period, rupee appreciation is a possibility. Unless the rupee slides back to the 42-43 range, it is not going to affect the topline, TCS chief financial officer S. Mahalingam said at a financial meet here today.         
	TCS will continue to play aggressive in the domestic market and has the requisite set of skills to execute complex projects, he said, adding the company will continue to hire in its on-shore division.

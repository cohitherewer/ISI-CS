	New Delhi, Sept. 23: Ford will start rolling out its small car Figo  developed for the Indian market  next year.         
	The car, whose price is yet to be announced, will compete in the compact car market dominated by Maruti Suzukis Alto, A-Star and the Swift, and Hyundais Santro, Getz and the i10.        
	Our plan for the Indian market involves accelerating development of fuel efficient small cars. The small car market in the country will double in the next one decade, said Alan Mulally, president and chief executive officer of Ford Motor Company. Ford ruled out plans to compete with Tata Motors Rs 1-lakh car Nano and Maruti Suzukis M800. However, officials said, the company is aware of the emphasis in India on value for money.         
	We will compete with the Maruti Swift and the Tata Indica, said Michael Boneham, president and managing director of Ford India. At present, small cars account for over 72 per cent of the 1.22 million cars sold in India. While every second car sold in India is a Maruti Suzuki model, players such as Hyundai and Tata Motors are increasingly becoming significant in the small car segment. Ford India enjoys a 2.07 per cent share in the Indian car market.        
	The global launch of the Figo here today comes at a time Ford is struggling in developed markets such as the US. It has just adopted a global strategy called One Ford, under which it will use similar global platforms to generate different cars for different markets.        
	The US car maker hopes to make about 2 lakh cars in India. It now has a capacity of 1 lakh cars. Officials did not reveal how many Figo cars would be made in the first year. The company plans to export a significant number of the Figo to the Asia-Pacific and African countries in 2010.

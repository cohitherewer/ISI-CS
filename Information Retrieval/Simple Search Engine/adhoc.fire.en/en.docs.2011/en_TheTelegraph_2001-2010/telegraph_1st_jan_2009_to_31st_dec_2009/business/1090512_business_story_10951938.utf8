                                                                                                               Car sales gather momentum in April
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                                            
	New Delhi, May 11: Lower financing costs and the governments stimulus measures have pushed car sales up by 4.2 per cent in April.        
	According to data released by the Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers (Siam), car makers sold 102,899 units in April 2009 against 98,752 units in the same month a year ago.        
	Total automobile sales in April grew 10.76 per cent on the back of a robust show by two-wheelers. Their sales rose 13.71 per cent to 700,995 units. Scooter sales grew 19.91 per cent to 97,129 units, while motorcycle sales jumped 12.11 per cent to 5,62,357 units.         
	Retail financing plays an important role in auto sales. With financiers becoming more open to lending, sales have started improving, said Atul Gupta, vice-president (sales and marketing) of Suzuki Motorcycle India. We expect the fiscal to end with a 12-14 per cent growth, Gupta said.         
	According to sources in the industry, a revival in retail financing and growth in production were the key drivers in scooters. However, analysts warned of weak fundamentals and said a complete revival would take time.         
	We have to be careful before saying there are signs of a revival. The fundamentals are still weak, said Sugato Sen, senior director at Siam.        
	In the next few months, unless further positive policy intervention is there, things will not improve, he said.        
	Siam estimates passenger vehicles to record a sales growth of 3-5 per cent in the current fiscal, commercial vehicles, 7-10 per cent (over a low base of the previous fiscal), two-wheelers, 0-5 per cent, and three-wheelers, 5-8 per cent.        
	To boost the industry, the government had cut Cenvat by 4 per cent and lowered the excise duty to 8 per cent from 10 per cent.         
	It also encouraged states to buy modern buses under the Jawaharlal Nehru National Urban Renewal Mission scheme.        
	Maruti Suzuki India led the growth in passenger cars with an 8.6 per cent rise in sales at 64,857 units. Its closest rival Hyundai Motor India Ltd reported a 3.5 per cent increase in sales at 22,247 units.         
	Both the firms saw a significant growth rate in exports on the back of new models. Exports at Hyundai, led by its compact car i20, grew nearly 20 per cent.         
	In Maruti, the A-star jacked the companys exports up by a massive 146 per cent to 6,891 units.        
	To beat the slowdown, car makers are launching models.        
	Maruti, in which Japans Suzuki owns a controlling stake, will launch the hatchback Ritz on Friday. Tata Motors will commence the delivery of its small car Nano from July, while Honda Siel has said it will launch its compact Jazz in June.        
	Sales of trucks and buses fell 11.3 per cent in April to 29,842 units from 33,626 units last year, reflecting a continuing downward trend. Ashok Leyland, the second-largest commercial vehicle maker, has reported a 69.33 per cent decline in sales at 1,750 units compared with 5,705 units in April 2008.         
	Suzuki India show         
	Japans Suzuki Motor Corp today said its net profit slumped by about two-thirds in the year to March but managed to stay in the black because of a relatively robust demand in India.

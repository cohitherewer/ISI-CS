  - Sebi is watching out for volatility, while brokers expect to see $2-3bn of FII inflows in the next few months                            Ashok Chawla, finance secretary                                  
	Market regulator Sebi is keeping a close watch on the stock markets which whipped up another bullish frenzy on Monday. It was expected that markets would do well  and that is what we saw this morning. Sebi is keeping a watch on the situation. We will see how it plays out tomorrow  the market movement is a good sign, but we would of course have to see that we dont have too much volatility (on the stock markets), finance secretary Ashok Chawla said in Delhi.         
	He added: A stable government is a good sign for the economy and favourable for the financial markets.         
	The markets, which opened for the first day after the announcement of the election results for the 15th Lok Sabha, saw the sensex zoom 2100 points to close 17 per cent higher at 14284.21.         
	A strong coalition, free of the pressures from its former communist partners, has boosted the prospect of reforms to encourage growth in the country. The new government, which is expected to be sworn in later this week, will come out with a full budget within 45 days of resuming office and could include measures to expedite economic reforms.         
	But the foreign investors are overjoyed with the returns on the Indian market. The sensex is now showing a year-to-date gain of 48 per cent, which places it at the top of the so-called BRIC heap  the acronym formed from the first letters of Brazil, Russia, India and China. The index now trades at 15.6 times earnings, twice the 7.7 multiple of November.         
	Mondays unprecedented rally has raised hopes that foreign institutional investors (FIIs) will continue to pump money into the Indian stock markets till Diwali.        
	Most marketmen agree that they expect to see at least $2-3 billion of FII inflows in the next few months. So far, FIIs net inflows total $1.89 billion in the period since January 1.        
	Foreign money will definitely come in. The market has already corrected its base position at around 12000 points. There are huge cash positions on the sidelines. However, it all depends on how soon reforms will be implemented. There are no more excuses for delaying the process, said Vijay Bhatia, country head at India Infoline.        
	The market also expects an increase in FDI, a stronger rupee that may hover at 46 to a dollar and, therefore, bring about a lot of relief to companies that are weighed down by foreign exchange losses. All these factors will have a beneficial impact on the markets, said a Mumbai-based fund manager.        
	The reality is that this clear verdict is potentially being seen as a game changer as far as FIIs are concerned with the caveat that the government must refrain from waffling again, said a Singapore-based hedge fund manager.        
	Another fund manager said most funds were underweight on India, which meant there was potential to increase allocations here. Several foreign funds are positioned in defensive sectors such as information technology and fast moving consumer goods and are likely to change their stance and turn more aggressive.        
	There also seems to be a reasonable amount of money available as the deal pipeline has picked up over the past few weeks. The Indiabulls private placement with institutions is likely to be priced today. Realty majors DLF and Unitech have raised money as has Suzlon. There is a rumour that GMR may pick up nearly $1 billion, said an investment banker.        
	Even private equity firms are bullish as they see the markets go north. The expectation of reforms gaining pace is also encouraging private equity to run more numbers, said a PE executive.         
	One interesting feature is that MSCI Emerging Market Index has added 2.5 per cent to 725.81 in early New York trades, underscoring the fact that the private equity players expect emerging market stocks to gain 20 per cent this year. The indexs advance was led by Unitech, which surged 27 per cent on the BSE.         
	The markets will be looking forward to two big events over the next month: the first is the budget which is expected to increase infrastructure spending, usher in reforms in areas such as pension, insurance and disinvestment, and underpin the governments desire to pare the rising fiscal deficit.         
	The second event is the RBIs monetary policy review  the central bank is expected to trim the cash reserve ratio for banks and possibly adopt measures to drive interest rates down even further. The RBI has cut interest rates six times since October but hasnt been able to persuade the banks to trim their lending rates at the same pace.         
	The two events will provide the direction to the markets.                     BUREAU REPORT

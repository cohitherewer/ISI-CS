                                                                                                               HDFC cuts interest on new loans 
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          PRICE COMFORT                                  
	Mumbai, Jan. 16: Housing Development Finance Corporation (HDFC) today cut interest rates on new home loans of up to Rs 30 lakh to 9.75 per cent  the lowest level in three years.        
	For housing loans above Rs 30 lakh, the interest rate has been fixed at 10.75 per cent. HDFC explained that these cuts had come as a result of reduction in its cost of funds. The corporation has brought down its deposit rates from January 15.        
	Following the deposit rate cut by 0.50 to 0.75 per cent from January 15, HDFC has now introduced a special disbursement offer on its home loans. Under this special offer, loans up to Rs 30 lakh will be at 9.75 per cent and loans above Rs 30 lakh will be at 10.75 per cent. This is a limited period offer for new floating rate home loan customers, a statement by HDFC said today.        
	The company said this offer was only for a limited period though it did not specify the time frame till which the scheme would last.        
	Before the special offer announced today, HDFC was charging 10.25 per cent for loans up to Rs 20 lakh and 11.25 per cent for loans above Rs 20 lakh.        
	Industry circles said the HDFC rate cut could also be a reaction to state-run banks announcing attractive interest rates on home loans apart from other incentives.        
	Last month, these banks announced that they would offer loans up to Rs 5 lakh with a tenure of not more than 20 years at an interest rate not exceeding 8.50 per cent. Customers could also get housing loans of Rs 5-20 lakh at an interest rate of 9.25 per cent. The scheme will run till June 30.        
	These banks also did away with processing and pre-payment charges and slashed margin requirements from 20-25 per cent to 10 per cent in the case of loans up to Rs 5 lakh and 15 per cent for loans between Rs 5 lakh and Rs 20 lakh.

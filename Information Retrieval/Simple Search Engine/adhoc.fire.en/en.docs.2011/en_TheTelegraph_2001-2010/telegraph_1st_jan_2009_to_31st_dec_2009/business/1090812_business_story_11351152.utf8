The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Jaguar escapes from UK shadow
                                                                                                               Jaguar escapes from UK shadow
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                            
	Mumbai, Aug. 11: Jaguar Land Rover (JLR), the ailing British car maker that the Tatas acquired last year, is close to sorting out its cash troubles by negotiating new credit lines with commercial banks.        
	The auto maker will no longer have to secure loan guarantees from the British government to access credit.        
	Relations between the Tatas and the British government had turned frosty earlier this year after the latter refused to provide loan guarantees.        
	The company is close to tying up short- and long-term financing requirements estimated at 450 million (Rs 3,562.20 crore) with commercial banks.        
	Denying that the talks with the UK government over loan guarantees had broken down, JLRs London-based spokesperson Don Hume said, Government assistance has helped us get funding from commercial banks.         
	In a statement, Tata Motors said: With the positive trend in the external environment in financial markets and improvement in general liquidity, these arrangements  with commercial banks for Jaguar Land Rover funding facilities  are expected to be concluded without necessitating guarantees from the UK government, for which discussions had been going on for some time.        
	The company also said it had successfully concluded funding facilities with commercial banks in the last few months, and the balance was expected to be completed in the coming weeks.        
	News agencies in London said that Tata Motors had secured a 175-million private sector loan for JLR. Hume, however, said that this number was speculative.        
	Tata Motors is also looking for guarantees to secure a 340-million loan from the European Investment Bank. The company has managed to sort out this requirement.         
	Tata Motors and Jaguar Land Rover also expect that the long-term loan from the European Investment Bank (EIB) of 340 million, sanctioned to Jaguar Land Rover, can also be successfully secured in the coming weeks through appropriate commercial arrangements, said the Tata Motors statement.         
	Agencies also quoted UK business secretary Peter Mandelson as saying, This additional funding (from private sector banks for short-term financing) will allow JLR to invest in future models and successfully launch the XJ saloon on schedule and updated Land Rover models later this year.        
	The government had offered bridging finance from the automotive assistance programme if necessary. We understand the Tata group will now be successful in resolving longer term financial needs but we are willing to help again if necessary, he added.         
	In the past, however, there were indications that the UK government had put up stiff conditions that Tata Motors would have to meet if it wanted loan guarantees from the government.        
	JLR has been hit by the global slump in demand for cars and was forced to declare over 2,000 workers redundant.        
	When talks with the UK government broke down on the loan guarantees, there was a buzz of speculation that JLR would order further job cuts. Hume denied this and said, This is speculation.

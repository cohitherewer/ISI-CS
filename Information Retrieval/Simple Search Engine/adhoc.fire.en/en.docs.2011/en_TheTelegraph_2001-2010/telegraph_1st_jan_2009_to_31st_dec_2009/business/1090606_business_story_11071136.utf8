	Calcutta, June 5: Ford India is set to unveil its small car, likely to be priced at about Rs 4 lakh, in early 2010.        
	Ford is targeting the volume segment. The small car, to be placed below the Ikon, will have a presence in the largest segment of the industry, Ford India vice-president (sales) Timothy Tucker said.        
	Last month, Ford India president and managing director Michael Boneham had said that the car would cost around Rs 4 lakh.        
	Ford will invest $500 million by 2010 to expand its Indian operations.         
	According to Tucker, the recent reverses suffered by the global automotive industry will have little impact on Fords investments and expansion plans in India. Our brands are doing well.

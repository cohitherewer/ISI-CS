          A STAFF REPORTER                                     
	Calcutta, Dec. 13: Tea output fell 2.18 million kg during January-October this year to 830.36 million kg from 832.54 million kg reported during the first 10 months of 2008.         
	Exports during the period dropped 12.4 per cent to 150 million kg from 171.2 million kg in the corresponding period last year, according to data published by the Tea Board of India and the Indian Tea Association (ITA).         
	Production dropped because of a decline in output in South India.         
	In Assam, output rose sharply, while Bengal remained under pressure.         
	Production in South India declined 2.3 per cent to 196.16 million kg during January-October from 200.78 million kg in the year-ago period.         
	In north India, output increased 0.4 per cent to 634.19 million kg from 631.76 million kg a year ago.         
	The United Planters Association of Southern India had projected that production in the region would slip 1.8 million kg during October; the actual fall was 2.1 million kg.         
	However, things are beginning to look up. The shortfall, which was about 7.5 million kg in September-end, had been bridged to 2.18 million kg by October-end.         
	Exports from north India have also dropped 22.2 million kg during the first 10 months of the year because of the drought in the first flush season. Exports from north India stood at 73.8 million kg during January-October 2009 compared with 96 million kg in the same period a year ago.         
	Exports from south India increased 0.9 per cent to 76.2 million kg from 75.3 million kg a year ago.         
	Global tea exports also dropped 5.8 per cent in May this year because of the truant weather and low fertiliser application.         
	North Indian tea, which comprises the Assam valley, Cachar, Darjeeling, the Dooars and the Terai, has seen an increase in output by 2.4 million kg during the first 10 months of the year compared with the year-ago period. But production in Bengal, which consists of Darjeeling, the Dooars and the Terai, has come down by more than 9 million kg.         
	Meanwhile, price realisation for north Indian tea has gone up during the first 10 months of the year.         
	Average price during the period is up Rs 25 per kg to Rs 159.11 per kg against Rs 133.87 per kg during the corresponding period last year.

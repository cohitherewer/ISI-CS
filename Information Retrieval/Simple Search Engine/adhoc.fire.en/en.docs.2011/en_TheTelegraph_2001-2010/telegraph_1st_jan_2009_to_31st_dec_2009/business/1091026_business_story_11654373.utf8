                                My husband and I bought a 3-storied incomplete building at Santoshpur, Budge Budge, in 1989-90 for Rs 90,000. We invested Rs 1.5 lakh in 1990-91 and another Rs 1 lakh in 1995-96 to complete the construction. We sold half of the house for Rs 2.25 lakh in 1997-98. In the mean time my husband died and my son became the co-owner of the property along with me. We sold the remaining portion of the house this year for Rs 4 lakh. What would the tax implication and how can I save the tax?          Mitali Seal, Rajarhat
                    You have to pay tax on the capital gains out of the transaction. Capital gain is the difference between the sale proceeds minus the cost of acquisition and development of the property. You can reduce the tax liability by using the indexation advantage. To do this, first get a valuers report on the market value of the property as on April 1991. Use the cost inflation index of 1989-90 to arrive at the inflation-adjusted cost of acquisition of the property as in 1997-98. Do the same exercise with the money spent on the development of the property. However, the exercise will be difficult for you because youll have to find values for the portion sold in 1997-98 and 2009-10 separately. Take help of an income tax practitioner. There are capital gains exemption bonds of NHAI and REC. You can also invest the money in capital gains account schemes of banks.                                  Seeking redressal      I have a Senior Citizen Savings Scheme account with Uco Bank, Calcutta. Since I am in need of money, I have applied for premature withdrawal from the account two months ago. But I have got no reply from the bank as yet. The account is scheduled to come for maturity a few months hence. Who is the authority I can approach for redressal? How long will the bank take to release the payment?         Qaiser Uddin Ahmed, Calcutta
                    Premature withdrawal from a Senior Citizen Savings Scheme is permitted after one year of opening this account. However, it comes with a penalty clause. If the bank has failed to reply to your withdrawal request within one month of your sending the request, you can approach the bank manager first with a written complaint letter and get a receipt copy of the same. If the bank still fails to redress your complaint, approach the banking ombudsman at the regional office of the RBI at Dalhousie. You can also claim compensation for the delay in payment by the bank.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                            
	Mumbai, March 19: Inflation may have sharply dipped to 0.44 per cent but bankers are not betting on another interest rate cut.        
	The Reserve Bank has already cut the policy rates five times in the past seven months  and that is why bankers expect it to maintain status quo.        
	Observers said the central bank would wait to assess the impact of its previous cuts. Earlier this month, the central bank had cut the reverse repo and the repo rate by 50 basis points each to 3.5 per cent and 5 per cent, respectively.        
	Since October last year, the apex bank has reduced both these key rates by a huge margin to rekindle economic growth.         
	The reverse repo is the rate at which the RBI absorbs liquidity from banks and repo is that at which it injects money to banks against securities.        
	The RBI is fully aware that it has done substantial easing. Banks have also brought down their interest rates in response to the RBI action. Therefore, its unlikely to cut interest rates further just because of the inflation numbers, says Rupa Rege Nitsure, chief economist at Bank of Baroda.        
	Tushar Poddar, economist at Goldman Sachs, said, With a 50-basis-point cut in both the repo and the reverse repo on March 4, we do not foresee further reverse repo cuts until the end of the elections.        
	Poddar anticipates inflation will turn negative in April and expects the trend to continue till the end of 2009. He reckons the RBI will trim the cash reserve ratio (CRR) by up to 150 basis points by the middle of this year. CRR is that portion of deposits that banks must park with the RBI. The CRR now stands at 5 per cent.        
	The bond markets are not expecting any immediate rate cut either. Sources said the reaction to the inflation number did not last long.        
	The markets had anticipated inflation to hit this number by the end of March. However, it happened a lot earlier. We were expecting an inflation of 0.89 per cent, said an analyst with a state-run bank.

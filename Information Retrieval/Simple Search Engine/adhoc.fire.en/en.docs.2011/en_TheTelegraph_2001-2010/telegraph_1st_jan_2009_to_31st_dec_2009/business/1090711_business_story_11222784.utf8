                                                                                                               Infosys numbers beat forecast
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                  
	Mumbai, July 10: Infosys Technologies, the countrys second-largest software exporter, today posted better-than-expected profit in the first quarter but lowered its revenue guidance for the fiscal.        
	The Bangalore-based IT bellwether recorded a net profit of Rs 1,527 crore for the three months ended June, up 17.3 per cent from Rs 1,302 crore in the corresponding period of the previous year and way ahead of analyst estimates of around Rs 1,400 crore.        
	Infosys said the full-year income in 2009-10 (revenue guidance) is expected to be in the range of Rs 21,416-21,747 crore, a year-on-year decline of 1.3 per cent to a growth of 0.3 per cent.        
	While announcing the results of the previous quarter, Infosys had said that the income would be in the range of Rs 22,066-22,928 crore.        
	Analysts say the lower guidance is because of a tough business environment, adding that the company often makes conservative estimates.         
	We believe that in the short term the global economic environment will continue to be challenging, Infosys chief executive officer and managing director S. Gopalakrishnan said.        
	According to Apurva Shah, head of research at brokerage Prabhudas Lilladher, the muted outlook shows new projects are not coming quickly and discretionary spend by companies is not growing.        
	Infosys has always been conservative and it has consistently been guiding lower than what can be achieved. Traditionally, they have always underpromised, but over-delivered, Shah said.        
	In the first quarter, Infosys earned an income of Rs 5,472 crore, a rise of 12.7 per cent over the same period last year, a sequential decline of around 2.9 per cent but ahead of analyst forecast of around 5 per cent decline.        
	Despite the lowering of guidance for the year, shares of Infosys gained in a falling market. The scrip gained nearly 3 per cent to end at Rs 1,726.50 on the Bombay Stock Exchange where the sensex slipped 253 points. During the day, Infosys surged over 5 per cent to a high of Rs 1,767.         
	On the National Stock Exchange, the share settled at Rs 1,721.15, up 2.60 per cent from the last close. It touched an intra-day high of Rs 1,769.80, up 5.49 per cent.        
	Over 30.25 lakh shares changed hands on the two stock exchanges.        
	Only the BSE IT index ended with gains among the sectoral indices as Infosys encouraging results sparked off buying in its peers. Wipro rose 3.37 per cent to Rs 384.70 and TCS was up 1.56 per cent to close at Rs 394.65 on the BSE.        
	Infosys said that for the quarter ended September 30, income is expected to be in the range of Rs 5,318-5,413 crore. For the fiscal year, revenues in dollar terms are expected to be between $4.45 billion and $4.52 billion.        
	During the first quarter, Infosys and its subsidiaries added 27 clients. The three months saw a gross addition of 3,538 employees and a net decline of 945 staff.        
	The cash and cash-equivalent of the company rose 62.33 per cent over the corresponding period a year ago. Cash and cash-equivalents include investments in liquid mutual funds and certificate of deposits.         
	At the end of the first quarter, they stood at Rs 12,030 crore against Rs 7,411 crore a year ago.        
	There are no plans to fill the post of co-chairman vacated by Nandan M Nilekani  who has gone on to head the governments unique identification number project  and his responsibilities have now been distributed among the top leadership team.

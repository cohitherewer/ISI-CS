                                                                                                               Ford hikes Ikon price
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                                            
	New Delhi, March 25: Ford India today said it would increase the price of its entry-level sedan Ikon by 1.5 per cent from April.         
	The company said it was doing it to offset rising component import bills resulting from rupee depreciation.         
	However, price hike would be restricted to Ikon as other models have already seen an increase, said Nigel Wark, executive director (marketing, sales and service), Ford India.

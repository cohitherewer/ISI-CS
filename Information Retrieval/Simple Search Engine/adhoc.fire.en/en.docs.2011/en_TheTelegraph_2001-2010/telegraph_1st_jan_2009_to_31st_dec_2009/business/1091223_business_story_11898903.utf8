The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Bajaj banks on new Pulsar
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Bajaj banks on new Pulsar
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Calcutta, Dec. 22: Bajaj Auto is targeting a bigger market share in the 125-150cc segment on the back of the Pulsar 135 LS, which was launched in the city today.        
	The segment is dominated by Hero Honda, India Yamaha Motor and Honda Motorcycle amp; Scooter India.         
	Bajaj had launched the Pulsar 220 and its 150cc and 180cc variants in April-November. However, the launches could not prevent a 5 per cent decline in sales in the 125-250cc segment during the period.         
	The company hopes the launch will revive interest in the Pulsar, which is its flagship brand.         
	We target to sell a million Pulsars next year, Milind Bade, general manager (marketing, two-wheeler), Bajaj Auto said here today.         
	The bike is priced at Rs 52,010 (ex-showroom) in Calcutta.         
	Apart from the name, the Pulsar 135 bears little similarity to the original.        
	Tough competition has shaken Bajaj Autos leadership in the 125-250cc segment, and its market share has slipped to 48 per cent from 54 per cent in the last one year.         
	Two-wheeler makers are crowding the 125-250cc segment as they offer higher margins and a better brand recall.         
	Till September, Bajaj Auto enjoyed a higher operating margin (22 per cent) compared with Hero Honda (20 per cent).        
	The new Pulsar is expected to do better next year since there are not many launches in the pipeline in the next few months from other bike makers.

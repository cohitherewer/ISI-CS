The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Loop licence under threat
                                                                                                               Loop licence under threat
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                          TESTING TIMES                                  
	New Delhi, Oct. 2: Mumbai-based Loop Telecom may lose its licence if it fails to prove that its ownership pattern does not violate telecom rules.        
	According to the department of telecom (DoT), an investigation by the ministry of corporate affairs has revealed that the Essar group has routed funds into BPL Communications, the main shareholder in Loop Telecom, through Santa Trading Private Limited (STPL).        
	According to licensing guidelines, no player can have more than 10 per cent equity in two telecom companies. The Essar group indirectly owns 9.99 per cent stake in Loop Telecom through Loop Mobile (earlier BPL Mobile). Loop Telecom is a majority-owned unit of Loop Mobile.        
	Essar also holds 33 per cent in its joint venture with Vodafone Essar. It is, therefore, not allowed to hold more than 10 per cent in Loop Telecom.        
	The DoT will soon send a show-cause notice to Loop Telecom seeking explanations on its ownership structure. If the reply is deemed unsatisfactory, Loop Telecom can lose its licence, said officials.        
	The ministry of corporate affairs has found that in addition to the 9.9 per cent equity, the Essar group exercises significant control over Loop Telecom through a complex financial structure.        
	The ministry report also revealed that the Essar group has significant financial control over Santa Trading, which owns 76.7 per cent in Loop Telecom. Thus, the Essar group can be stated to have significant control over Loop Telecom, said DoT officials.        
	Loop Telecom is 24 per cent owned by BPL Communications, while BPL Mobile Communications holds 51 per cent and Capital Global, Mauritius, has 24 per cent.         
	This structure gets complicated with BPL Communications holding a 73.99 per cent stake in BPL Mobile Communications. STPL has about 86 per cent in BPL Communications. This will mean that a company controlling STPL will also control Loop. The Essar group holds 9.99 per cent indirectly in STPL. Santa Trading is owned by Kiran Khaitan, sister of the Ruia brothers  Shashi and Ravi  who own the Essar group.         
	A Loop Telecom spokesperson said, The shareholding structure had been provided to the DoT at the time of issue of licence. The shareholding structure is fully compliant with relevant guidelines.

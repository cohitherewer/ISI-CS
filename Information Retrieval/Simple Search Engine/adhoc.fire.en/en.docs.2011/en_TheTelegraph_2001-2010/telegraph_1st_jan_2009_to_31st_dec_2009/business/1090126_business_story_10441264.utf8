                                                                                                               Slowdown revs up used car market

	New Delhi, Jan. 25: The used car business is witnessing a flurry of activities as the economic slowdown puts brake on the market for new models.        
	Tata Motors and General Motors India are the new players, while the existing ones are sharpening their act.        
	The growth slowdown  experts say it can be till the middle of this year  has prompted manufacturers to concentrate on this area, sources said.         
	Tata Motors has launched its used car programme  Tata Motors Assured  on a pilot basis with 15 dealers in 10 cities. They are Mumbai, Delhi, Bangalore, Hyderabad, Chennai, Pune, Ahmedabad, Chandigarh, Ludhiana and Vapi in Gujarat.         
	According to S. Krishnan, vice-president Tata Motors (commercial passenger car business unit), the company will offer certified pre-owned Tata cars. The cars will be refurbished by the Tatas at some select workshops.        
	The models will be less than 5 years old and have not been with more than two owners.         
	General Motors India, too, has announced plans to enter this segment. It will soon launch their scheme, called Chevrolet OK, in a phased manner.         
	It is a pilot project and we plan to start with 10 dealers. Depending on the popularity, it will be taken to other dealers, Karl Slym, president and managing director of General Motors India, said.        
	Maruti Suzuki India, which has been in the business since 2001, is said to be working on its True Value programme.         
	The company is banking on its Internet initiatives to consolidate its position.         
	We have tried to better our search function and make it more detailed. Be it an enquiry on a model, its assessed sale or purchase price, variant and even colour availability, we are trying our best to give personalised attention. Queries have gone up considerably, said Ravi Bhatia, chief general manager, Maruti True Value.        
	True Value has a 10 per cent share of the business. Maruti says it has witnessed 22 per cent increase in sales for April-December 2008.         
	The increase in sales is a result of our efforts and also partly because of the impact of recession which hit the auto industry, Bhatia said, adding that in recent times more number of visitors have visited the True Value website than Marutis own portal.        
	Others such as Audi India, BMW India and Porsche India are planning to enter the business soon.         
	In 2007-08, there was a small gap between the sales of new and used cars  1.5 million of the former were sold against 1.4 million second-hand models.

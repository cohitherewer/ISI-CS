          SOUNAK MITRA                                         
	Calcutta, Nov. 22: Pakistani demand for Indian tea has fallen drastically this year. The beverage is a major item of trade between the two countries.        
	In the first six months of 2009 (January to June), exports to Pakistan stood at 2.77 million kg compared with 3.77 million kg in the year-ago period, according to statistics available with the Indian Tea Association (ITA) and the Tea Board of India.         
	During July-September 2009, exports declined drastically to 0.62 million kg, data from the Pakistan Tea Association (PTA) revealed.         
	During July-August 2008, the figure stood at 1.58 million kg.         
	In 2008, India also missed the target of exporting 10 million kg to Pakistan. Exports fell sharply in the last quarter of the year.         
	Total exports stood at 7.67 million kg in 2008, though the figure was 5 million kg by August.        
	According to the PTA, India contributed 1.09 per cent to the countrys imports in July and 1.76 per cent in August; in September, this shot up to 5.35 per cent.         
	During the first half of the year, the export market was not favourable because of global recession, but we expect to register a better performance during the last quarter of 2009, ITA joint secretary S. Patra said.         
	The socio-political scenario in Pakistan is not favourable for business. However, relation among the tea traders in the two countries is very friendly.         
	In June, an ITA delegation was in Dubai for the promotion of Indian tea.         
	We met PTA people among others. We had a fruitful discussion. We expect that exports to Pakistan will rise in the coming months, Patra said.         
	Last year, after the terrorist attacks in Mumbai, an Indian tea delegation had called off a promotional tour to Pakistan.        
	The delegation had planned to meet traders in Pakistan and encourage them to buy more.         
	Pakistan is the worlds third-largest importer of tea with nearly 175 million kg of annual purchases.

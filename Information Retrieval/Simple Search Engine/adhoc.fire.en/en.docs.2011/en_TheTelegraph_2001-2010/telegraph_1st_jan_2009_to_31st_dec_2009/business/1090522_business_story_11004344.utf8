The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Religare faces stiff fight for AIG unit
                                                                                                               Religare faces stiff fight for AIG unit
                          Battling it out                    
	New York, May 21 (PTI): Religare Enterprises and Australian Macquarie Group  the two companies in the race to buy global insurer AIGs asset management unit  face stiff competition from Franklin Templeton Investments, which has emerged as the leading bidder, says a media report.        
	The Wall Street Journal, citing people familiar with the matter, in a report said, Franklin Templeton Investments has emerged as the leading bidder for American International Group Incs asset-management business, a deal that also has drawn interest from Australias Macquarie Group and Religare Enterprises of India.        
	The AIG Investments unit, which manages about $85 billion in assets for clients, including pension funds and insurance companies, is expected to fetch a price of about $500 million, well below the $800 million some suitors proposed paying just two months ago, the report said. A deal is expected to be completed by June end, it added.        
	Macquarie and Religare, which formed a joint venture to compete for the AIG division, are prepared to jump back into bidding if AIGs negotiations fall through with Franklin Templeton and its partner, New York-based private equity firm Crestview Partners LP, the daily said.         
	But at this point the talks with the Franklin Templeton group are exclusive, the report said quoting people familiar with the matter.        
	AIG, which was rescued by the US government in September, has sought to unload its various businesses to repay the funds it has borrowed from the government.        
	The giant insurer has targeted several transactions, including selling the portion of AIG Investments that oversees outside money.         
	But the portfolio, which had about $100 billion in assets before the year-end, has declined in value as clients pulled their business and holdings lost value.

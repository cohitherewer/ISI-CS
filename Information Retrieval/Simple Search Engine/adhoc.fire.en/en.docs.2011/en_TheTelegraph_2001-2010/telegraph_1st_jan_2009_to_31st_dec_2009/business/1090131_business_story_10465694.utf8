                                                                                                               Court lifts ban on Reliance gas sale 
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                            
	Mumbai, Jan. 30: Mukesh Ambani today won a critical court battle against brother Anil when Bombay High Court lifted a 20-month stay that barred Reliance Industries from selling gas from its deep-water field in the Krishna Godavari basin to third parties.        
	The stay had been imposed in May 2007.        
	Reliance Industries  which plans to start the production of gas by the end of February  will be allowed to sell gas to fertiliser plants and power utilities at the government-mandated price of $4.20 per million British thermal unit (mBtu) under five-year contracts.        
	A division bench comprising Justices J. N. Patel and K. K. Tated passed the interim order in the raging battle between the Ambani brothers over the rights, entitlements and pricing of the gas.        
	Anil Ambani-owned Reliance Natural Resources Ltd (RNRL) has been claiming that it is entitled to 28 million metric standard cubic metres of gas per day (mmscmd) at a price of $2.34 per mBtu. It has also laid claim to another 12 mmscmd of gas that RIL was supposed to supply to National Thermal Power Corporation (NTPC). RIL has refused to honour the commitment in the absence of a formal agreement with NTPC.        
	Todays interim order will be in force till the court gives its final verdict. Although there was no indication from the court when the final judgment would be pronounced, RIL counsel Harish Salve said the verdict could come by the end of March.        
	The two sides wound up their arguments today in the case that had dragged on for over two years.        
	The court order set some conditions for the sale of gas. Besides the price of $4.20 per mBtu, the court said natural gas would be supplied to third parties in consonance with the gas utilisation policy approved by the empowered group of ministers in September 2007.        
	Under the terms of the policy, gas will first flow to designated fertiliser plants and then to power utilities.        
	The order said RIL would be at liberty to enter into appropriate term contracts with the purchasers of gas for a term of up to five years.        
	However, RIL will mention in these contracts that the quantity and the term, shall, if necessary, be liable to be modified or altered in the event that it is finally directed by the court to supply gas to RNRL for its power plants. The supply contract will also be subject to any directions issued by Bombay High Court in the dispute between RIL and NTPC.        
	Sources said the sale of gas would be without prejudice to the rights and contentions of the two parties  RIL and RNRL  as well as NTPC.         
	RIL had won the bid to supply gas at a price of $2.34 per mBtu to NTPC. However, Reliance wanted changes in the contract before signing the final supply agreement with NTPC. This dispute is also before Bombay High Court.

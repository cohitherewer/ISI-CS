The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Top executives call on Singh
                                                                                                               Top executives call on Singh
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Singh in New Delhi on Monday. (AP)                                  
	New Delhi, Jan. 12: Prime minister Manmohan Singh today met some leading industrialists in the wake of the Satyam scam and the World Bank ban on Wipro.         
	At the meeting with Singh were Jamshed Godrej, former CII president R. Seshashayee, CII mentor Tarun Das and Suresh Neotia of Gujarat Ambuja, among others. The PMO said the meeting was a routine one, and the industry leaders refused to comment.         
	Sources said the Prime Minister was concerned about the image of Indian business. He is keen that big names with impeccable records are on the board of Satyam.         
	Sebi chairman C.B. Bhave met Singh and briefed him on the probe into Satyam, which the regulator is undertaking in a co-ordinated manner along with Andhra Pradesh CID, the Serious Fraud Investigation Office and the Registrar of Companies. The last two are central entities.        
	Singh had earlier met top finance ministry officials. State-run banks had been discreetly told to continue offering credit to Satyam, while a bailout package was being worked out.         
	This package will not involve direct government funding. Officials said the government was thinking in terms of an interim credit facility. Substantial funds may be provided later.         
	Satyam, after the Rs 7,000-crore accounting fraud, lacks even working capital. Commerce minister Kamal Nath told newspersons that the government is looking at all aspects to help Satyam recover.        
	Once the board comes up with its proposals, the government will consider assistance to the beleaguered firm. There are many jobs at stake, the minister said.        
	Officials said cabinet secretary K.M. Chandrasekhar also held a review meeting with the officials of the ministry of corporate affairs.         
	The PMO has asked the cabinet secretary to co-ordinate the activities of the various departments vis--vis Satyam.        
	Minister for corporate affairs P.C. Gupta also held many meetings, including a review of the probe.        
	Officials said that two preliminary reports  on the Satyam-Maytas merger and the accounting fraud  could be released in the next two to three days.         
	Gupta said the government would not take over other Raju firms now.        
	Satyam, founded in 1987, made its name by helping companies tackle the Year 2000 computer bug.

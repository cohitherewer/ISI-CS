The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | ITC raises stakes in hotel rivals
                                                                                                               ITC raises stakes in hotel rivals
          SAMBIT SAHA                
	Calcutta, April 26: ITCs appetite for hotel rivals continues unabated.         
	The diversified company from Calcutta has built up further positions in Hotel Leelaventure and EIH Ltd.        
	Russel Credit, the investment arm of ITC, bought around 27.1 lakh shares in Leelaventure between January and March.        
	During the same period, it acquired 93,943 shares in EIH, raising its holding to 14.98 per cent. This is the highest ITC has held in EIH, which owns Oberoi Grand in Calcutta, in the last seven years. ITC is now just 78,333 shares away from triggering an open offer.        
	According to the Substantial Acquisition of Shares and Takeovers regulation of the Securities and Exchange Board of India, a company has to make a mandatory open offer for an additional 20 per cent once its holding in an entity reaches 15 per cent.        
	As on December 31, 2008, ITC held 14.96 per cent in EIH. ITC has maintained that the share purchase is not strategic.         
	In Leela, its stake is 3.72 per cent, which is not significant, though it is steadily acquiring shares. ITC checked into the Bangalore-based hotel chain in the September-December quarter of the last fiscal with a 3 per cent stake, as The Telegraph had first reported.        
	When contacted to comment on ITCs buying spree, an ITC spokesperson said, These are routine treasury operations.        
	In the past, the EIH management had not given much importance to ITCs shareholding in the company.         
	ITCs stake had remained near 15 per cent for a long period. Unless the cigarette-to-hotel conglomerate crossed the threshold, there was nothing for EIH to talk about, EIH officials had said.        
	Leela has also remained silent on ITCs overtures so far.         
	We do not disclose our plans. But as you can see, it is listed as a long-term investment in the balance sheet, ITC chairman Yogi C. Deveshwar had said, while commenting on his companys strategy for EIH at the annual general meeting in July 2008.        
	ITC had picked up a stake in EIH  which owns and manages the Oberoi chain of hotels in India and abroad  in 2001, fuelling speculation of a hostile takeover. However, ITC held on to its stake without threatening to replace the EIH promoters or the management during the period. In the meantime, it strengthened its presence by setting up hotels.        
	Promoters P.R.S. Oberoi and his family own a 46.42 per cent stake in EIH. If ITC decides to make an open offer for another 20 per cent, it cannot hope to get control of EIH unless a section of the promoter family offload their stake.        
	ITCs stake purchase in Leela would also not give the Nairs  the promoters of Hotel Leelaventure  any cause for worry as they hold a majority 51.56 per cent in the company.        
	ITC ranks somewhere in the middle between EIH and Leela. EIH, formerly East India Hotels, has a bigger presence than ITC in India and abroad.         
	ITC does not have an overseas hotel. Leela, on the other hand, is on an expansion mode, building on its oldest and most successful hotel in Bangalore.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Jessop to transfer land
                                                                                                               Jessop to transfer land
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Calcutta, July 7: Pawan Ruia plans to transfer land in Jessop to a group firm to prop up the valuation of the company as it faces a fiscal-end deadline for a mandatory 24 per cent stake dilution to remain listed on the bourses.        
	Ruia is considering a stake sale to private equity players or strategic investors but is yet to get the valuation he is hoping for as investors are not keen to include the cost of assets in their offer. When stripped of the land, a strategic investor would value Jessop on its operative performance.         
	The investors are not considering the valuation of assets, such as of the land Jessop owns. They are only going by the financial figures from core operations, he said after the annual general meeting of the company today.        
	Ruia holds close to 95 per cent in the Calcutta-based engineering company, while the central government holds 4 per cent, making up the 99 per cent promoter holding in Jessop.        
	Promoters must reduce their stake below 75 per cent by March 31, 2010 to remain listed on the Calcutta Stock Exchange or to get listed on the BSE or the NSE.        
	Ruia plans to transfer Jessops prime land on Jessore Road near the Calcutta airport to a group firm which in turn will lease the land to Jessop. He has stepped down from the Jessop board as chairman and plans to do so in Dunlop and Falcon, though he will continue to own them.         
	The transaction will not require any cash transfer. Instead, the group firm will issue shares equal to the value of the land to Jessop.        
	Ruia had done a similar exercise in Dunlop and helped the ailing tyre company out of the Board for Industrial amp; Financial Reconstruction. However, Dunlop had excess land which was transferred to group firms.         
	In Jessop, the plant is spread over 71 acres. Thus, the group firm would have to lease back the plot to Jessop.

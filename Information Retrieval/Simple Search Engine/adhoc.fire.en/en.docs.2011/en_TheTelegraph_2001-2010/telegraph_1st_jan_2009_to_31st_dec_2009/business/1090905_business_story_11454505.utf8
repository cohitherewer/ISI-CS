The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Window open for US pact 
                                                                                                               Window open for US pact

	New Delhi, Sept. 4: Ron Kirk, the US trade representative, will return to India next month to negotiate a separate bilateral framework for a trade agreement.        
	We have a trade policy framework with India but we need to map out a commercial relationship, said Kirk, who was here to attend the ministerial meeting of the WTO.        
	The US official hinted that while a free trade pact with India was not yet in the offing, it was a long-term goal.        
	Bilateral talks for a trade policy framework with the US could mean good news for Indian software manufacturers who felt threatened by the Obama administrations promise of protecting US jobs.         
	While the US is likely to bargain for a sharp reduction in tariff for high-value textiles, spirits and other consumer goods along with the opening up of sectors such as banking, India will seek easier export terms for manufacturing and service.        
	Two years ago, the US had stopped the duty-free import of Indian gold jewellery and brass lamps. This came after the then commerce minister Kamal Nath had rejected the demand for tariff cuts on import in return for halving farm subsidies by the EU and the US, at trade talks held earlier that year in Germany.        
	India traded goods worth $43 billion with the US in calendar year 2008, with a positive balance of $8 billion. The US wants to increase exports to India to correct the balance.         
	Kirk admitted that free trade pacts were a difficult sale in a tough economic environment and could be passed by Congress only if a case was built that they would help create jobs in the US.

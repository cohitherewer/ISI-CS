The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Govt faces on board emerge as option
                                                                                                               Govt faces on board emerge as option
          JAYANTA ROY CHOWDHURY                          UNDER SCANNER                                  
	New Delhi, Jan. 8: The department of company affairs has commenced the probe into Satyam without waiting for the companys latest audited account to be considered by the board on Saturday.         
	It may even ask top IT personnel, financial experts and bankers to run the company in the interim period as government nominee directors once it has gone through the reports of the registrar of companies (RoC) and market regulator Sebi. Such interventions are allowed under Section 401 of the companys act.         
	The department will also see whether there are any criminal and tax liabilities for further action.         
	Following the intervention of the Prime Ministers Office today, the government decided to speed up the probe at a meeting of the top brass of the company affairs ministry, finance ministry and Sebi.         
	Officials said the PMO was concerned because not only domestic investor confidence was low but also Indias image abroad was at stake. Andhra Pradesh chief minister Rajasekhara Reddy had also written to the Centre for a change in the management of Satyam, they said.         
	DCA sleuths said, The probe will be suo moto (independently and not on the basis of any complaint) and may extend to other group companies. We have prior experience in probing Satyams affairs. In 2002, too, we probed alleged accounting fraud related to investments in subsidiaries.        
	The department in 2002 did consider the complaints of shareholders but dropped the charges after explanations by Satyam. The charges were of directors investing improperly in subsidiaries which underperformed, the company evading taxes, claims on excessive depreciation and improper maintenance of accounts.         
	Satyam had even admitted then that it had adopted higher rates than what was normally allowed. However, these had been shown in the annual report and were in compliance with the company act.        
	The officials said work on the fresh probe would start as audited figures for previous quarters and years are available. The Registrar of Companies officials as well as Sebi are starting work.

                                                                                                               Talks spark hope for closed tea gardens
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Calcutta, Feb. 18: The Centre is hopeful of reopening two to three tea gardens in Bengal over the next four months.        
	Additional commerce secretary P. K. Chaudhary  who held a meeting with the Tea Board, owners and representatives of the closed tea gardens, bankers, prospective buyers and senior state government officials today  said the outcome of the discussion was positive.        
	We had a fruitful discussion. The Tea Board will pursue the matter, he said.         
	Sources from the Tea Board said the representatives of eight of the 12 closed gardens attended the meeting.        
	There are about 17,000 workers in the closed gardens. This is our primary concern, the secretary said.         
	The Bengal government had recently announced incentives for the gardens. A high-powered committee is assessing the situation.        
	The Centre, too, had announced a rehabilitation package for the workers.         
	The Tea Board has been facilitating the discussions between the owners of the closed gardens, their bankers and the trade unions.        
	On December 15, the state government had announced incentives for those keen on reviving the gardens in the Dooars. It has promised a waiver of electricity dues and a lower employment and education cess, among other benefits. The two-year scheme is for gardens closed over a year. They must be registered with a tea company for at least five years.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Dec. 24: The Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs (CCEA) today allowed Jet Airways to raise $400 million, or around Rs 1,800 crore, from foreign investors.         
	The airline, which needs cash to support expansion and operate low-cost carrier JetKonnect at a time airlines across the globe are reporting losses, had already got shareholders approval for the issue of fresh shares.         
	Jet will raise the cash through private placements. The CCEA has approved the proposal of Jet Airways to raise up to $400 million through qualified institutional placements from foreign institutional investors, information and broadcasting minister Ambika Soni said.        
	Jet suffered a net loss of Rs 406.69 crore in the quarter ended September against a net loss of Rs 384.53 crore a year ago. Earning fell 34.4 per cent to Rs 2,020.11 crore over the year-ago period.        
	Airlines in India are estimated to suffer a combined loss of over Rs 10,000 crore this fiscal.         
	Officials said assurances by the airline that it would comply with the FDI cap seemed to have helped the proposal go through.         
	It was feared that the fresh issue of equity could bring down promoter Naresh Goyals holding in the company to 42 per cent from 80 per cent. The civil aviation ministry is also believed to have insisted that the control of the airline should remain in Indian hands after the sale of shares to foreign investors.         
	The Jet scrip closed higher at Rs 553.55 on the Bombay Stock Exchange today.

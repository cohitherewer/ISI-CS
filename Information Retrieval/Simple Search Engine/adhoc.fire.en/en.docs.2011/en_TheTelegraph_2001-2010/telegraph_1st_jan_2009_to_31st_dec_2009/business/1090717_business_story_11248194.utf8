The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Borrowing plan soothes nerves
                                                                                                               Borrowing plan soothes nerves
          OUR BUREAU                                            
	July 16: The government plans to borrow Rs 1.1 lakh crore between July 18 and September 25 under a new market borrowing schedule it finalised with the Reserve Bank of India today.        
	The money will be raised through bond flotations over the next 10 weeks.        
	The government will have raised Rs 2.99 lakh crore by the end of the first half of this fiscal ended September 30. It will need to raise a little over Rs 1.5 lakh crore in the second half of the year if the fiscal deficit doesnt expand.        
	Bond prices surged as the Rs 1.1-lakh-crore figure fell way short of the markets expectations. While the benchmark 10-year security rose around 43 paise, its yield came down to 6.79 per cent against the close of 6.85 per cent on Wednesday. Government security yields are inversely related to their prices.        
	The figure of Rs 1.1 trillion removed fears that the government would try to push through most of its borrowings in the first half itself, said J. Moses Harding, head of global markets at IndusInd Bank.        
	Rising bond prices meant that yields fell. Yields on the 10-year security should range between 6.75-7 per cent, Harding added.        
	Banks will be chuffed about rising bond prices. Most banks are showing robust treasury income in the first quarter this year at a time when profits from their core business of lending have been crimped.        
	Late in the evening, the RBI came out with a new borrowing calendar that showed that most of the borrowing would be done through securities with tenures of either 5 to 9 years or 10 to 14 years. A very small amount will be raised through long dated paper of over 15 years.        
	After the interim budget in February, the government and the RBI had come out with an indicative calendar for market borrowings for the first half that pegged the borrowing requirement at Rs 2,41,000 crore.        
	The government has already borrowed Rs 1,77,000 crore till the week ended July 3. It is scheduled to raise another Rs 12,000 crore through tomorrows bond auction.        
	The market certainly has the appetite today as there is a lot of liquidity (in the system). Therefore, we are trying to borrow more directly at this stage, finance secretary Ashok Chawla said in New Delhi.        
	Under the new calendar, the government will borrow Rs 36,000 crore in July through three auctions, another Rs 36,000 crore till August 28 in three auctions, and Rs 38,000 crore in September through four auctions, a government statement said.        
	The new figure means the government will complete about 66 per cent of its full-year borrowing target of over Rs 4,51,000 crore by the end of the first half.         
	Analysts have been complaining that the borrowing programme would not only crowd out private borrowers but also roil the stock market as it could suck out money that might have otherwise found its way into the bourses.        
	If the government can raise additional revenue through disinvestment, the borrowing in the second half can be lower, said Sonal Varma an economist at Nomura.         
	Rupa Rege Nitsure, chief economist at Bank of Baroda, said, The major part of the net borrowing for the year is in the first half itself. This appears to be the optimum quantity at this juncture. The recovery momentum is likely to be slower in the first half. In the second half, when we expect to see stronger recovery, the government borrowing will not interfere with private demand.

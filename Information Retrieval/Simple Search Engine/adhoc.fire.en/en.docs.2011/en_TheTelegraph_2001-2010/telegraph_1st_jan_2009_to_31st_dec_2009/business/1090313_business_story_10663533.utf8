                                                                                                               Trai leash on newbies
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                          CASH CALL                                  
	New Delhi, March 12: The Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai) today said that the promoters of the firms who got licences in early 2008 should not sell their stakes for three years.        
	Firms can issue new shares, provided the promoter stake does not fall below 10 per cent.         
	Promoters can sell their shares under some conditions during the three-year lock-in period.         
	Fifty per cent of the profit from the sale should be utilised for expansion, while the rest should go to the government.        
	Besides, Trai said, the operators should have fulfilled their rollout obligations and obtained the telecom departments approval.         
	The election code of conduct, however, will prevent the implementation of the proposal till a new government is formed.        
	Last year, the department of telecom referred the matter to Trai, stating it wanted to prevent promoters from making windfall gains by selling stakes. Some of those who received licences in 2008 have already inducted foreign partners.        
	Telenor of Norway acquired a 60 per cent stake in Unitech Wireless for Rs 6,120 crore through new shares.         
	Swan Telecom offloaded 45 per cent to the UAEs Etisalat for $900 million. Batelco, or Bahrain Telecom, along with Dubais Millennium Private Equity paid $225 million for a 49 per cent stake in Chennai-based STel. The deals were largely funded by new shares.        
	The regulators recommendations can affect the expansion plans of Datacom and Loop Telecom, which are in talks with several foreign players for a stake sale.

                                                                                                               Tax breaks for gas hunt in pipeline 
          R. SURYAMURTHY                          Sop season                                   
	New Delhi, May 26: The Manmohan Singh government may offer gas exploration projects the same tax sops as oil finds to attract global investors to the eighth round of bidding for oil and gas blocks.        
	Firms engaged in oil exploration are eligible for a seven-year tax holiday.         
	The parity on tax concession is very high on the government agenda and the finance ministry has seen reason in our argument. A clarification to this effect could come any time soon or in the budget, a senior petroleum ministry official said.        
	India, which launched its biggest ever oil and gas hunt, offering 70 blocks for bidding on April 9, deferred promotional road-shows as investors had expressed concerns about the lack of tax incentives on production of gas.        
	Officials said, Greater clarity will come very soon. The government is doing its best to attract the private sector and foreign investment in exploring Indias sedimentary basins.        
	According to the provisions of the Income Tax Act, 1961, companies commercially producing mineral oil are eligible for a 100 per cent tax break for seven consecutive assessment years, including the initial year. In the budget for 2008-09, the finance ministry had limited the definition of mineral oil to only crude oil, not including natural gas.        
	However, the exclusion is not justified as exploration operations cover the entire hydrocarbon sector and are not specific to oil or gas.        
	The tax holiday was a major incentive to attract exploration companies into India and its withdrawal could keep investors away.        
	India is offering 24 deep-sea blocks, 28 shallow water blocks and 18 onland blocks to attract $3 billion investment.        
	The date for final submission of bids for NELP-VIII is August 20.

	New Delhi, Sept. 3: India today made it clear that the Doha round of global trade talks was nowhere near conclusion, as was being claimed by some developed nations.        
	It has been suggested that most issues have been settled and we are almost in end game. However, there are still a few gaps and a large number of unresolved issues, commerce minister Anand Sharma said at a meeting of trade ministers of 35 countries belonging to the World Trade Organisation (WTO). According to Sharma, differences exist both in the terms for non-agricultural market access (Nama) and agriculture.         
	WTO director-general Pascal Lamy insisted that the Delhi meet could be the beginning of the end game of the Doha round.         
	While Lamy said 80 per cent of the agreement had been secured, Sharma cautioned that the remaining 20 per cent were far from resolved.         
	In some instances, the architecture of a solution is not yet fully in sight. In others, there still remain negotiating gaps that need to be sufficiently narrowed before ministers can collectively outline the way forward and come up with fair solutions, Sharma said.        
	Representatives of the western countries sounded optimistic. Australian trade minister Simon Crean said, We are very close to its (Doha round) conclusion. We are now in the end game of the negotiations.        
	Trade ministers of 35 WTO member countries are meeting here today and tomorrow to push for a global trade pact, talks for which began in Doha, the capital of Qatar, in 2001. The meeting is being attended by trade ministers and representatives from Australia, Brazil, the US, South Africa and China, among others. Sharma said, One of the main threats to a revival in trade flow is the rising protectionist pressures and continued delay in concluding the Doha round. Therefore, strengthening the multilateral trading system by concluding the Doha round at the earliest is vital.        
	He said the two-day meeting was not the appropriate forum to talk on specific issues as the representatives of all the 153 member countries of the WTO were not present. According to Sharma, the decision should be left for a meeting of all the trade ministers to be held in Geneva  the headquarters of the trade body  between November 30 and December 2.        
	Lamy said restrictive steps by countries to protect their domestic markets in the wake of recession had hurt international trade.

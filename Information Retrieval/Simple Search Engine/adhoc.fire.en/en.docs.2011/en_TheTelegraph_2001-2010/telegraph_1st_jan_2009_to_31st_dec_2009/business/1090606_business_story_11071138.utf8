                                                                                                               ICICI Bank explores growth avenues
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Mumbai, June 5: ICICI Bank  the countrys second largest bank  is looking to diversify its revenue streams and its funding profile as it remains confident about growth in the Indian economy.         
	Chanda Kochhar, managing director and CEO, has said the ICICI group is looking at a wide opportunity spectrum and will benefit from increasing household incomes and consumption in both rural and urban India, significant industrial and infrastructure investment and the vast Indian diaspora globally.        
	We see favourable prospects for the Indian economy. Our strong domestic consumption and investment drivers will continue to support healthy rates of growth over the medium-term, Kochhar said in a note to the shareholders in the banks annual report for 2008-09.        
	Kochhar took over as the banks managing director and CEO on May 1. As we prepare for the next phase of growth, we will work on diversifying our funding profile and revenue streams, she said.        
	Officials from the bank did not elaborate on whether the bank was looking at new revenue streams. Apart from its core business, ICICI Bank also gets fee-based income from retailing others products.                                
	 quot;We, as a multi specialist financial services group, are well positioned        
	to capitalise on these opportunities. We will continue to participate in        
	Indias growth by meeting the financial services needs of the Indian        
	Economy, quot; Kochhar said.              
	An interesting highlight of the annual report was that the banks top brass that included KV Kamath, Chanda Kochhar, V Vaidyanathan, Madhabi Puri Buch, Sonjoy Chatterjee and K Ramkumar did not receive any performance bonus or stock options during the fiscal year.               
	While Chatterjee and Ramkumar are the executive directors of the bank, V Vaidyanathan and Madhabi Puri Buch were earlier the executive directors of ICICI Bank.              
	Sources said that the top management decided to forego performance bonus        
	and stock options in view of the economic conditions. In 2007-08, Kamath        
	and Chanda Kocchar received 270,000 and 180,000 stock options respectively.

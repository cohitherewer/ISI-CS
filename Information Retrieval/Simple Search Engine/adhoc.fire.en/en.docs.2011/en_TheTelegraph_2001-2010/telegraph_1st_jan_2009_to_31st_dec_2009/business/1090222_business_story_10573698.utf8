                                                                                                               Satyam flaunts $250m deals
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          GAINING STRENGTH                                  
	Hyderabad, Feb. 21: Satyam Computer Services has garnered new businesses worth $250 million since Ramalinga Rajus disclosure of a Rs 7,100-crore accounting fraud in January.        
	Top company officials feel that the new deals signify the confidence of customers in Satyam in spite of its misfortunes.        
	While Satyam chairman Kiran Karnik commended employees for their effort to keep the company on track, chief executive A.S. Murty said the deals included a single order worth $50 million.        
	The Satyam board, which met here today, also appealed to all the senior executives of the company to stay on and not desert the ship.        
	It is time you play real leaders, the board said while authorising Murty to implement a retention plan for its key officials. The core members (15 in all) are likely to receive a package of nearly Rs 1 crore each for steering the company out of the present mess, a spokesperson for Satyam said.        
	PW fired        
	The Satyam board today decided to invite bids from strategic investors to steer the company out of its financial quagmire and proposed to fire its statutory auditor Price Waterhouse, which failed to detect the massive accounting fraud in the IT giant.        
	The company, however, did not provide details of the process which left the interested parties, including Tech Mahindra, Spice Corp and the Hinduja Group, wondering what steps to be taken next in this regard.        
	Deepak Parekh, who is a member of the board, said it had approved the process to be followed for inviting a strategic investor and decided to seek regulatory approvals early next week. Upon receiving these clearances, the board would announce the process to be observed. The board has also proposed the removal of its auditor Price Waterhouse.        
	The board had recommended to the ministry of corporate affairs for the removal of Price Waterhouse (PW) as the statutory auditors of the company and notified PW.         
	PW has tendered its resignation to act as statutory auditors of the company. The company is now intending to appoint new statutory auditors, a Satyam statement said.         
	Remand extended        
	A local court here today further extended the judicial remand of Ramalinga Raju and four others by 14 days. The 6th additional chief metropolitan magistrate extended the judicial remand of all the five accused till March 7.        
	The other accused, whose judicial remand was extended today, are Satyams former managing director and Rajus brother Rama Raju, former CFO Vadlamani Srinivas, and Price Waterhouses sacked employees S. Gopalakrishnan and Talluri Srinivas.        
	It was the fifth extension of the judicial remand of the Raju brothers and Vadlamani Srinivas since their arrest last month, who are lodged in Chanchalguda jail, along with PWs auditors Gopalakrishnan and Talluri.

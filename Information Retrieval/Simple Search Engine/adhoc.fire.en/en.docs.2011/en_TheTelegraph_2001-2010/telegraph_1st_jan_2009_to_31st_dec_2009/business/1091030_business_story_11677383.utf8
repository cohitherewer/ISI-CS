          OUR BUREAU                                            
	Oct. 29: Auto maker Mahindra amp; Mahindra (M amp;M) today reported a net profit of Rs 843.6 crore for the second-quarter ended September 30, driven by good sales in automotive and farm equipment sectors.        
	The company, which had a net profit of Rs 373.3 crore in the same quarter a year ago, said its results were not comparable owing to the restatement of accounts after the merger of Punjab Tractors Ltd with itself last year.         
	Gross revenues and other income stood at Rs 8,262.2 crore against Rs 7,768.8 crore a year ago.        
	The companys utility vehicle segment witnessed a 43.7 per cent growth selling 55,280 units against 38,462 units last year.         
	In the farm equipment sector, tractor sales grew 27.1 per cent to 93,105 units from 73,227 units a year earlier.        
	The M amp;M scrip closed at Rs 927.75 on the BSE today, up 3.93 per cent from its previous close.         
	Grasim show        
	Grasim Industries  an Aditya Birla group firm  has posted a 61 per cent rise in consolidated net profit for the quarter ended September 30 at Rs 781 crore compared with Rs 486 crore in the year-ago period.        
	Net revenue grew 6 per cent to Rs 4,743 crore from Rs 4,486 crore. On a standalone basis, revenue from the cement business grew 19.22 per cent to Rs 3,621 crore, while that from the viscose staple fibre business grew 13.67 per cent to Rs 931 crore. Grasims standalone net profit went up 61 per cent to Rs 674 crore from Rs 419 crore a year ago, while net revenue increased 12 per cent to Rs 3,026 crore.        
	Sterlite profit falls              
	Total income declined to Rs 6,129.06 crore from Rs 6,810.99 crore in the year-ago period. The profit during the quarter and half-year period was impacted by lower by-product realisations, which was partially offset by higher sales realisation on account of depreciation of the rupee, Sterlite said.

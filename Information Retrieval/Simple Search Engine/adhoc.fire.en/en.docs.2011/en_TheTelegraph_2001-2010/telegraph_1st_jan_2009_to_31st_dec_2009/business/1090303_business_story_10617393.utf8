                                                                                                               Exports shrink 16% in January

	New Delhi, March 2: Exports plunged 16 per cent in January to $12.38 billion because of the global recession.         
	This is the fourth straight month of export loss, commerce ministry data showed.         
	Imports were down 18.2 per cent to $18.46 billion in the month. Oil imports fell 47.5 per cent to $4.46 billion, while non-oil imports were down 0.5 per cent to $13.99 billion.        
	Sonal Varma of Nomura said, Exports are likely to remain weak in the next two quarters as external demand remains subdued. We expect imports to fall faster because of falling commodity prices and the slump in investment.        
	Trade deficit narrowed to $6.1 billion in January compared with $7.57 billion in December because of the sharp decline in imports.        
	Fieo president A. Sakthivel said the government needed to take bold decisions to make exports competitive. It must increase the drawback and DEPB rates, abolish fringe benefit tax, exempt exports from service tax and neutralise higher costs of credit.        
	Economic growth dipped in the third quarter to 5.3 per cent, the weakest in six years, as farm and manufacturing output contracted, raising doubts if the country would be able to achieve the governments estimated 7.1 per cent growth.        
	Imports are declining because of slowdown in industrial production which is close to zero per cent, slippage in domestic demand and dip in international commodity prices  to some extent currency depreciation too might have contributed to the decline in import of non-oil items, D.K. Joshi, principal economist with Crisil, said.        
	The weak outlook for external demand prompted the government to trim its exports target for the fiscal to between $170 billion and $175 billion from $200 billion earlier.

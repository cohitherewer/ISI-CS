The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Seven more to get city gas
                                                                                                               Seven more to get city gas
          R. SURYAMURTHY                                            
	New Delhi, March 16: The government has invited bids for piped gas to seven more cities.         
	They are Ghaziabad, Allahabad and Jhansi in Uttar Pradesh; Rajahmundry in Andhra Pradesh; Yaman in Pondicherry; Shahdol in Madhya Pradesh and Chandigarh. Aggregate investments of Rs 2,500 crore are expected in the seven cities.        
	Earlier, the Petroleum and Natural Gas Regulatory Board had held bids for six cities but are yet to finalise the allotments.        
	Sources said the bids for the seven cities would have to be submitted by June 25.        
	Though the first round of allotments are pending, the regulator has decided to initiate the second round of bidding because of the interest shown by several players to provide piped gas.        
	The average cost of setting up a city gas  or piped gas  distribution network is around Rs 300-400 crore. The governments target is to roll out the service in about 200 cities over the next five years. This will involve an investment of Rs 60,000 crore.        
	The board has received bids from eight companies  GAIL Gas, GSPC Gas Company, Reliance Gas, Bhagyanagar Gas, Bharat Petroleum Corporation, Indraprastha Gas, DSM Infratech and Indian Oil Corporation (which has a joint venture with Adani Energy) for the six cities in the first phase.         
	The six cities are Sonepat (Haryana), Dewas (Madhya Pradesh), Kota (Rajasthan), Meerut (Uttar Pradesh), Kakinada (Andhra Pradesh) and Mathura.        
	The financial bids will be called soon and the distribution rights will be awarded by May. City gas is available in Mumbai, Delhi and some cities of Gujarat.        
	The winner will get 25-year exclusivity on the use of infrastructure and five years marketing exclusivity.        
	The bids will be evaluated across many criteria, with weights assigned for each. Some of the criteria are network tariff (40 per cent weight), cost of CNG compression (10 per cent), number of connections (30 per cent) and size of the network (10 per cent). The regulator is trying to ensure that the cost of transporting gas to the consumers is kept at a minimum.        
	At present, only about half a million people get piped gas, which is about 30 per cent cheaper than liquefied petroleum gas. The government plans to extend the reach to 20 million households over the next few years.        
	Analysts say piped gas consumes 5-6 per cent of the total available gas, or 5-6 million standard cubic metres per day.

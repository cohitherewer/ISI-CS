The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | May date for new set-up
                                                                                                               May date for new set-up
          PIYA SINGH                              
	Mumbai, Feb. 5: Satyam Computer Services may have a strategic investor and a new management in the saddle as early as mid-May.         
	Investment banking sources indicated that KPMG and Deloitte would be in a position to present the restated accounts of the company by March 15. By April 1, the sale process could be kicked off with a limited window for due diligence. Sources said the potential buyers would have about a month to pore over Satyams restated books, which meant that the strategic investor or buyer should be in place by May 15.         
	In a statement issued by Satyam, new chief executive A.S. Murthy said, We will chart a precise and practical 30-, 60-, and a 90-day plan that will encompass and address the interests of all stakeholders. This lent credence to the theory that a strategic investor might be in place at the end of three months.        
	While these timelines are speculative, one investment banker said the race for Satyam would hot up after the re-statement of accounts.         
	Private equity firms and other technology companies may have cooled off their interest for the time being but the firm may actually be an attractive buy, he said.         
	According to ballpark estimates by this banker, there are two possible benchmarks for Satyams market capitalisation and the price that a potential buyer will have to pay. If the market capitalisation is calculated according to the average price paid by a recent investor, it works out to around Rs 5,500 crore. If a buyer is looking to acquire a 26 per cent stake, he will have to roughly cough up Rs 1,500 crore.         
	In the second scenario, if the market capitalisation is calculated on the basis of manpower, the average cost estimate of man hours per year in the IT industry is about Rs 8 lakh per employee.         
	So, assuming that Satyam has 53,000 employees, the market cap works out to Rs 4,250 crore. In that case, a 26 per cent stake will work out to around Rs 1,100 crore.         
	While none of these calculations are perfect, the point is that there will be several buyers who will be keen to acquire Satyam at these valuations, he said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Ficci business confidence index rises
                                                                                                               Ficci business confidence index rises
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                          Healthy symptoms                                  
	New Delhi, May 31: A Ficci survey has revealed that Indian industry is expecting a revival in the economy and a movement towards a higher growth trajectory.        
	For the fourth quarter of 2008-09, the overall business confidence index, according to the survey, has increased to 64.1 from 44 for the third quarter. The findings have come close on the heels of the Central Statistical Organisations announcement of a 6.7 per cent growth rate of the economy in 2008-09, which was much better than expectations.        
	The higher index in its business confidence survey mirrors the sentiment prevalent during the first half of 2007-08, Ficci officials said.        
	According to the survey, 57 per cent of the factory owners covered by Ficci feel the economy will grow at a faster pace in the next six months, a 9 per cent improvement over the previous survey, taken three months back.        
	However, industry feels there is an immediate need to bring down the interest rate in line with the decline in the repo rate to give a boost to demand and credit growth. We are paying an average interest rate of 12 per cent and will want to see a decline in the interest rate by about 3-4 per cent, said industrialists, who were among the survey respondents.        
	The government also wants banks to pare lending rates to single digits. Finance minister Pranab Mukherjee, who is likely to meet chiefs of state-run banks in the second week of June, has emphasised on the necessity of cutting rates, in line with the falling cost of funds, and stepping up loans to industry.         
	Since October, the RBI has reduced the repo rate  the rate at which banks borrow from it  by 425 basis points to 4.75 per cent. The reverse repo rate, or the rate at which the central bank borrows from banks, has been lowered 275 basis points to 3.25 per cent. The cash reserve ratio  the percentage of deposits that banks have to maintain with the RBI  has been cut 400 basis points to 5 per cent to inject Rs 1,60,000 crore into the system. However, the commensurate decline in the prime lending rate has been only 224 basis points.         
	Ficci surveyed 300 companies in sectors such as textiles, cement, steel, leather, chemicals and fertilisers, auto and auto components and banking.

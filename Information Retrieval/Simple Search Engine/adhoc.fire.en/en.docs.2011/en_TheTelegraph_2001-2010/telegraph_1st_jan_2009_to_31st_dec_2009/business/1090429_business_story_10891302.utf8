          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Mumbai, April 28: Reliance Industries has signed agreements with nine customers in the power sector to supply natural gas from its KG-D6 block. Interestingly, one of the buyers is Reliance Infrastructure Ltd, an Anil Ambani group company.        
	Reliance will supply the gas according to the formula approved by the government. The sale price, as fixed by the empowered group of ministers on September 12, 2007, will be $4.20 per million British thermal unit (mbtu).        
	According to Reliance, the agreements are for supplying roughly 11 million standard cubic meters (mmscmd) natural gas to 11 different power generation facilities. The duration of contracts is for five years.        
	Besides Reliance Infrastructure, the other customers are: Gautami Power, Gujarat Paguthan Energy Corporation, GVK Industries-Phase I, GVK Industries Phase II, Konaseema Gas Power, Lanco Kondapalli Power, Maharashtra State Power Generation Company, Torrent Power  Sugen, Torrent Power  Vatva and Vemagiri Power Generation.        
	P. M. S. Prasad, president amp; CEO (petroleum) of RIL, said, We look forward to entering into pacts with other customers in this sector soon. The expected supply of 18 mmscmd gas to the power sector would largely eliminate the deficit in gas supply faced by these units.         
	The supply of Reliance gas will result in the generation of approximately 4000MW of power.

	Chicago, Feb. 6 (PTI): Software giant IBM is offering its recently laid-off employees jobs in growth markets such as India and Russia and will provide shifting costs and visa assistance.        
	Through the Project Match programme, IBM is offering its outgoing workers in the US and Canada a chance to take up an IBM job in India, Nigeria and Russia, CNN quoted an IBM internal document.        
	The company would help ex-employees locate potential job opportunities in growth markets where (their) skills are in demand.         
	IBM would offer the assenting employees financial assistance to offset moving costs. It will also provide visa assistance and other support.        
	The company is also offering jobs in China, Brazil, the Czech Republic, South Africa, Nigeria, and the United Arab Emirates.         
	The programme is limited to satisfactory performers who have been notified of separation from IBM in the US or Canada and are willing to work on local terms and conditions, the document read.        
	Employees who agree to relocate to India and other countries will have to be paid much less than what they used to earn in the US.

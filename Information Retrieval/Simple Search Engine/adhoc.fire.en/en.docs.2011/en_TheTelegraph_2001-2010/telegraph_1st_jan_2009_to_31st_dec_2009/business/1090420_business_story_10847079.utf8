The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | PSU banks aid firms in foreign bonds buyback 
                                                                                                               PSU banks aid firms in foreign bonds buyback

	Mumbai, April 19: Public sector banks have stepped in to lend a helping hand to cash-strapped Indian companies who are unable to buy back their overseas convertible bonds.         
	Companies are eager to buy back their foreign currency convertible bonds (FCCBs) because of the discounts  although lower than last December. However, several large and mid-sized companies are finding it difficult to arrange the funds for the buyback.        
	Highly leveraged balance sheets, the depreciating rupee and a cash crunch have made it difficult for companies to go for buybacks. Companies are keen to buy back the FCCBs, issued when stock prices were very high, as converting them into equities is an expensive proposition.         
	However, banks are helping their clients reduce the liabilities on their balance sheets.         
	The chief investment officer of one of the countrys largest PSU banks, who does not wish to be named, said, We have extended loans of roughly $10 million through our overseas arms to around seven clients to buy back FCCBs. However, these are existing clients and we have conducted a due diligence on them and are helping them to strengthen their balance sheets.             
	Investment banking sources said recently a Delhi-based realty company and a listed hardware firm had managed to get PSU banks help them to buy back their FCCBs, which were trading at a discount.   
	Some companies have also been in dialogue with private equity firms. However, it is unlikely that such a transaction has taken place, a private equity executive said.         
	According to estimates, while 25-30 buybacks have already been done in the last quarter of 2008-09, there are several companies that are still looking to buy back the convertible bonds at a discount. Amtek Auto, Orchid Chemicals and Jubilant Organosys are reportedly some companies looking to buy back FCCBs.         
	While some of these firms are having a hard time managing their debt obligations and raising funds to buy back the FCCBs, there are other hurdles adding to their woes.         
	The Indian convertible bonds are not widely traded, and perceived to be low in quality. Besides, there are several regulatory restrictions that prolong the buyback process, an investment banker said.         
	In December last year, the Reserve Bank of India had relaxed the buyback norms allowing companies to use their forex resources  India and abroad  or raise fresh external commercial borrowings, provided there was a minimum discount of 15 per cent on the book value of the FCCBs.

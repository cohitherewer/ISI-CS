The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Telecom seeks fewer levies
                                                                                                               Telecom seeks fewer levies
          JAYATI GHOSE                              
	New Delhi, June 28: Telecom firms are seeking a simpler levy structure and an extension of the duration of tax sops.        
	Besides, the government is likely to announce state-run Bharat Sanchar Nigam Ltds proposed listing in the upcoming budget.         
	The initial public offering proposal is likely to be included as a statement of intent in the budget, said officials of the department of telecom.         
	The BSNL board had last year approved a plan under which the government would divest 10 per cent of its holding. However, opposition from unions had stalled the process.        
	Industry players are also expecting clarity on 3G auctions and the allocation of spectrum for 2G services this week, prior to the budget.        
	The 3G auction, which is likely to be concluded before December, is expected to generate Rs 25,000-40,000 crore, enabling the government to plug its widening fiscal deficit.        
	Analysts said the rationalisation of taxes was essential as firms would invest heavily in 3G, number portability and broadband.         
	According to T.V. Ramachandran, director-general of GSM lobby Cellular Operators Association of India (COAI) , As a first step towards rationalisation, a uniform licence fee of 1 per cent of adjusted gross revenue, excluding universal service obligation fees, across all segments of telecom should be applied as opposed to multiple fees and levies.        
	AGR stands for gross revenues minus service tax and payments made to enable services such as charges for interconnection.         
	A flat fee structure will cover not only firms offering mobile and fixed-line services but also those with licences for national and international long-distance services, and the Internet.        
	The industry faces service tax, licence fees, spectrum charges, state levies and corporate income tax.         
	Data compiled by the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India show Indian firms paying up to 30 per cent of their total revenues towards various levies compared with 5-7 per cent paid by their counterparts in the other Asian countries.        
	In tax sops, the industry wants to be treated on a par with infrastructure.        
	The COAI wants tax breaks for 20 years, and there should be full exemption on profits for 10 successive years.        
	At present, the full relief is for five years, followed by 30 per cent exemption in the next five years. The tax break is for 15 years.        
	Among the other concessions sought by the industry are a reduction in customs duty on imported equipment and a continuation of basic duty concessions for network infrastructure equipment.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Govt counts RIL gas gains
                                                                                                               Govt counts RIL gas gains
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Oct. 7: The government will earn $16.57 billion of the total revenue of $38.30 billion from RILs Krishna Godavari D-6 basin, the director-general of hydrocarbons (DGH) has said.        
	During its project life of 15 years, Reliance and its Canada-based partner Niko Resources are expected to earn $10.63 billion from the D-6 field, which holds reserves of 10,027 billion cubic feet of gas, the regulator said through advertisements issued in financial newspapers.        
	The DGHs advertisements were seen as an attempt to refute charges made against it in the course of a protracted battle between the Ambani brothers, in which the Anil Ambani-led Reliance Natural Resoruces had claimed that RILs capital expenditure figures had been gold-plated.        
	The DGH, headed by V.K. Sibal, said the capital expenditure at KG-D6 field had gone up from $2.47 billion to $8.8 billion due to a three-fold rise in plant capacity, doubling of output, 16 additional wells and a host of other facilities.        
	Costs rose because of an increase in in-place gas reserves from 7.6 trillion cubic feet to 12.59 trillion cubic feet (tcf), which included reserves in deeper water depth and in more complex subsurface conditions, he said.        
	The recoverable reserves were initially estimated at 5.32 tcf with a peak production rate of 40 million standard cubic meters per day. The recoverable reserves have now been revised to 10.03 tcf with a peak production rate of 80 mmscmd, the DGH said.        
	Reliance has, however, created sub-sea capacities to handle 120mmscmd to accommodate any future discoveries and upsides from the same block.        
	Defending the $4.20 per mmbtu price fixed by the group of ministers, the DGH said selling gas to affiliates (RNRL) at artificially depressed price would benefit private enterprise at the cost of the government.

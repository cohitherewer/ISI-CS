The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Thai focus on airports
                                                                                                               Thai focus on airports
          A STAFF REPORTER                                    
	Calcutta, Sept. 12: Thai companies engaged in infrastructure development are eyeing airport modernisation projects in India.        
	There is a huge business potential here for the Thai companies engaged in infrastructure development. The Indian government has lined up ambitious spend in infrastructure over the next few years which includes the modernisation of airports, Krit Kraichitti, Thai ambassador to India, said at a programme organised by the Confederation of Indian Industry (eastern region) here today.        
	Italian Thai Development, one of Thailands biggest builders, has already bagged the modernisation work of the Calcutta airport. The company is also constructing an NHAI-funded 31-km stretch on the Assam-Bengal border.        
	We are looking forward to other airport modernisation projects, Kraichitti said.         
	Automobile, information technology, pharmaceuticals, textiles and tourism are the other sectors where Thai companies can play a crucial role, according to Kraichitti.        
	By 2010, trade between India and Thailand is estimated to reach Rs 50,000 crore from Rs 30,000 crore now.         
	The free trade agreement signed in 2003 resulted in a significant rise in two-way trade between India and Thailand, the ambassador said.        
	As part of multilateral cooperation, Kraichitti said, Southeast Asian countries and India had been coordinating to promote the Buddhist circuits in their respective nations to attract tourists.         
	This would enable people of the region to discover each others culture, he said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Bankers see rate hike by year-end

	Mumbai, Sept. 8: Senior bankers today warned that lending rates could harden in the second half of this year as borrowers swarm the market and credit disbursements rise.        
	Chanda Kochhar, managing director and CEO of ICICI Bank, and Naina Lal Kidwai, chairman of HSBC India, said interest rates had bottomed out and could start rising by the end of the year.        
	The rates will remain flat for now but can go up by the end of the year, Kidwai told reporters on the sidelines of a bankers summit here.        
	Kochhar said corporate clients had started preparing to invest in projects that they had put on hold when the financial crisis erupted late last year.        
	The ICICI managing director said there had been a large project pipeline estimated at $400-$500 billion just before the global financial crisis erupted. Promoters of these projects had started reviving these project plans in the last couple of months, she said.         
	Lending rates will rise in line with the increase in credit offtake, Kochhar added.        
	The views expressed by both Kochhar and Kidwai coincide with that of others in the industry who feel that interest rates could begin their upward climb by the end of this calendar year or earlier next year because of various factors that include higher inflation and increased demand for credit among others.        
	In its first-quarter review of the monetary policy in July, the RBI left its key rates  repo and reverse repo  unchanged. The repo is the rate at which it provides funds to banks against the government securities they hold. The reverse repo is the rate at which it absorbs money.         
	Kochhar said banks would find credit growth opportunities on both the retail and corporate portfolios. Early this year, ICICI Bank deliberately slowed down its asset growth. The private sector bank is now looking to grow both its home and auto loan portfolios in the coming months.         
	She said strong growth in consumption would spur investment demand and lead to the creation of fresh manufacturing capacity in the country.        
	State Bank chairman .P. Bhatt said the nationalised banks had witnessed good growth in retail loans in the second quarter. He said the SBI was lending around Rs 5,000 crore on an aggregate basis every month. The SBI expects its earnings growth in the second quarter to be around 30-35 per cent, he said.

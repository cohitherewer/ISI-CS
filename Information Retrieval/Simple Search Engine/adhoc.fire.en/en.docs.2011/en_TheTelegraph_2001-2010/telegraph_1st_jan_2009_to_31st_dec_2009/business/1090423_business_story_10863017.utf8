The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | June date set for Satyam open offer
                                                                                                               June date set for Satyam open offer
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                            
	Mumbai, April 22: Tech Mahindras open offer for Satyam will run from June 12 to July 1.        
	The company proposes to acquire 20 per cent of Satyam, or 19.90 crore shares, at Rs 58 per share, aggregating around Rs 1,150 crore.        
	Kotak Mahindra Capital today made the announcement on behalf of Venturbay Consultants, a wholly owned subsidiary of Tech Mahindra.         
	Last week, Tech Mahindra outbid others in the race to acquire a controlling stake in Satyam Computer Services. The government-appointed board of Satyam had approved the acquisition of a 31 per cent stake for Rs 1,756 crore.        
	The deal had also been cleared by the Company Law Board.        
	As part of the takeover, Tech Mahindra has deposited Rs 2,910 crore in an escrow account for a 51 per cent controlling stake in the troubled IT firm, which plunged into chaos when its founder B. Ramalinga Raju confessed to fudging the books of the company to the tune of Rs 7,100 crore.        
	However, the public announcement made on behalf of Venturbay did not contain any financial details on Satyam.         
	The acquirer has been intold that as on the date of the public announcement, the financial statements of Satyam are being investigated by Deloitte Haskins amp; Sells and KPMG and only after the completion of the ongoing investigation will the accounts be restated, Venturbay said.        
	On February 27, Satyam Computer had requested the Securities and Exchange Board of India to relax the takeover norm for the scam-hit IT firm with respect to the mandatory disclosure of financial information.         
	Based on the request, the market regulator had exempted Satyam from providing its latest financial data in the offer document.         
	If such information was required before the closure of the offer, it would be disclosed by way of a public announcement or included in the letter of offer, Sebi had observed.        
	Accordingly, the public announcement does not contain any financial information of Satyam. The Company Law Board, in its order dated April 16, has also exempted Satyam from making any disclosures before December 2009, till the restated financials are available, Venturbay said.

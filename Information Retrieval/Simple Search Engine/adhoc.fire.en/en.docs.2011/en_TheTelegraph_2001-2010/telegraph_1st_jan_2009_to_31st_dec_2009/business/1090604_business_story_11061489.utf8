	New Delhi, June 3: The government today promised more steps to boost exports, which fell 30 per cent in May.        
	We will be giving sector-specific incentives so that our exports become competitive, and there is a case for lowering interest rates, commerce minister Anand Sharma told reporters after a meeting with export organisations.        
	Exports contracted about 30 per cent in May according to the quick estimates, commerce secretary G.K. Pillai said today. The final figures will be released on July 1.        
	Slowdown in the economies of our export markets and a high base effect were the reasons for the contraction of merchandise exports and the government would take adequate measures to address sector-specific needs, he said.        
	Exports fell the most in 14 years, by 33.2 per cent, in April to $10.74 billion from $16.08 billion a year ago.         
	Taking into account the May figures, exports have fallen for eight months running.        
	Pillai said the contraction of about 30 per cent was likely to continue till about August, and then exports would, in all likelihood, turn positive.        
	Sharma said he would be meeting finance minister Pranab Mukherjee soon and would make sector-specific recommendations.         
	Mukherjee is likely to present the budget for this fiscal in the first week of July.

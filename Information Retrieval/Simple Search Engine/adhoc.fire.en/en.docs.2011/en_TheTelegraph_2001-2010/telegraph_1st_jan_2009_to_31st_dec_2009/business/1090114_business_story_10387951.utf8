The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Probe panel sifts through clues
                                                                                                               Probe panel sifts through clues
          JAYANTA ROY CHOWDHURY                          Gupta: Careful                                  
	New Delhi, Jan. 13: The Serious Frauds Investigation Office, formally given the Satyam case today, has actually been at work behind the scenes since the weekend.        
	Sources said Satyams chairman B. Ramalinga Raju might have siphoned off funds as the software business was much more profitable than what he said in his confession.        
	Raju had said that the returns were 3 per cent of revenue and not 24 per cent as stated in the accounts.        
	However, investigators feel they were three-five times more.        
	Raju is also believed to have earned about Rs 2,500 crore through the sale of shares in Satyam in the last eight years, when the holdings of his family came down to 8.74 per cent from 25.6 per cent in March 2001.        
	Sleuths said some of the money seemed to have been sunk into land, though offshore funds were also a possibility.        
	The share sale and at the same time the manipulation of accounts to show a highly profitable and successful company thus helping to jack up prices obviously mean we have leads to possible insider trading here, officials said.        
	The Registrar of Companies today transferred the case to SFIO after a preliminary investigation revealed that Rajus misdemeanours were not a simple case of violating the companies act but had ramifications covering criminal law, money laundering and offshore wrongdoings.        
	The probe by the Serious Fraud Investigation Office will be based on certain facts. The time given is three months. Action will be taken without any delay, minister for corporate affairs Prem Chand Gupta said here today.         
	If the auditors are found guilty of misconduct, they will be punished, Gupta said, referring to the inability of Satyam auditor Price Waterhouse in detecting the Rs 7,000-crore fraud.        
	Chartered accountants body ICAI today constituted a six-member special panel to look into the auditing of Satyam. It will submit its report on February 11.

	New Delhi, July 15: India is likely to miss the export target of $200 billion for this fiscal because of the continuing global financial crisis.         
	The government had fixed the target in its interim trade policy in February.        
	The government and the Reserve Bank are monitoring both the domestic and international economic developments, Jyotiraditya Scindia, minister of state for commerce and industry, told the Rajya Sabha today.        
	Exports have been sliding since October because of a drop in demand in the US and Europe.         
	After growing at 31.3 per cent in the first half of the last fiscal, exports plunged 22.3 per cent in the remaining six months.         
	For 2008-09, exports were at $168.7 billion, a marginal growth of 3.5 per cent.

	Officials said measures such as cheap credit and incentives for exports to Latin America, Africa and Oceania could find a mention in the policy.        
	I will be interacting with the industry and whatever is not there in the budget, they may get it in the foreign trade policy, textiles minister Dayanidhi Maran said.         
	The government has announced an extension of the existing 2 per cent interest subvention (subsidy) scheme till March 2010.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Union farm minister Sharad Pawar (extreme left) with state food ministers in New Delhi on Wednesday. (PTI)                                  
	New Delhi, Aug. 19: The government today said it could intervene to regulate food prices as it saw rice output falling by as much as 10 million tonnes and a drop in sugar and oilseeds production.         
	In the wake of expectations of the reduced production of rice and wheat, the government will not hesitate to undertake open market intervention, farm minister Sharad Pawar said here today at a conference of state food ministers on the drought situation.        
	The Congress-led government is planning to release 3 million tonnes of wheat and 2.5 million tonnes of rice from its reserves in the open market to beat down the prices of foodgrain, which have risen up to 30 per cent since the beginning of 2009.        
	Officials said an empowered group of ministers, headed by finance minister Pranab Mukherjee, had approved the release of foodgrain. The agriculture ministry will now decide on the date and manner of the open sales.        
	Ten states have declared 246 districts as drought-affected, which is 46-47 per cent of the districts in the country, Pawar said.        
	Area under rice, the minister said, might fall by about 5.7 million hectares compared with the previous year, which would lead to output falling by 10 million tonnes. India produced 99.15 million tonnes of rice in 2008-09, including 84.58 million tonnes in the kharif season.        
	A good monsoon is vital for farm growth as about 60 per cent of crop land is unirrigated and dependent on rainfall.         
	He said the production of oilseeds and sugarcane might drop, too, though he did not give any estimate.        
	Sugar prices have increased nearly 40 per cent in the past few months, as have the price of pulses.        
	Oilseeds during the monsoon were planted in 15.2 million hectares compared with 16.4 million hectares a year earlier, the agriculture ministry said.        
	The government will extend the subsidy of Rs 15 per litre on imported edible oils till March, the minister said.        
	He said the prospects of sugarcane output for the season starting October were not bright. Cane production in the year ending September may be 15 million tonnes against a demand of 23 million tonnes.        
	The government will try to procure the maximum amount of rice to ensure supplies to the poor through ration shops.        
	Pawar told the food ministers that state governments should see that ration shops should function in an efficient and transparent manner. He asked them to enforce laws to stop hoarding.        
	Only a few states had responded to the Centres offer to distribute wheat under a special scheme. Of the Centres proposed allocation of 9.09 lakh tonnes, the states had picked up 0.74 lakh tonnes.

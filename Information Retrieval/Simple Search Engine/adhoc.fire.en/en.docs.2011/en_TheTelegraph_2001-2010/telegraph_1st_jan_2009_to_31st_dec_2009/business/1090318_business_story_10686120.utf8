The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Direct tax mop-up on course
                                                                                                               Direct tax mop-up on course
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, March 17: The government has collected Rs 2,96,000 crore by way of direct taxes so far, raising hopes that it will be able to meet the revised target of Rs 3,45,000 crore for the full year.        
	Direct tax collection showed an improvement of 18 per cent year-on-year, a finance ministry official said.        
	I am pretty confident that the revised tax collection target of Rs 3,45,000 crore will be achieved for this fiscal, the official said.        
	The data include 36 per cent growth in corporate tax deducted at source (TDS) and a 17 per cent rise in non-corporate TDS.         
	However, a gap of Rs 49,000 crore still needs to be filled. Around Rs 15,000-20,000 crore more is expected to come from advance taxes.        
	In the fourth quarter, the SBI was the highest advance tax payer at Rs 1,810 crore.        
	Overall, banks have paid more in advance taxes than companies.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Phased bidding plan for oil 
                                                                                                               Phased bidding plan for oil 
          R. SURYAMURTHY                                                Drill Time      
	New Delhi, March 29: The petroleum ministry plans to launch the eighth round of bidding for oil blocks in two phases, beginning April, instead of auctioning the blocks all at once.         
	The empowered committee of secretaries is expected to take a decision soon and decide on the number of blocks to be offered in each phase, sources said.        
	The committee, comprising the secretaries of law, finance and petroleum, will take a call on the 100-odd blocks the director-general of hydrocarbons plans to offer in the next round of bidding, slated to be the biggest so far. The blocks will include onland, shallow offshore and deepwater blocks.        
	The next round is getting delayed because of the global financial crisis and the ensuing Lok Sabha polls.        
	Major exploration and production (E amp;P) firms are facing a liquidity crunch because of the global recession and low crude prices.         
	However, a senior petroleum ministry official said this was the right time to offer the blocks as E amp;P firms took a long-term view rather than the short-term fall in the price of crude and the slowdown in economy.        
	As a strategy, we plan to offer half of the planned blocks in the first phase and the remaining later, depending on the kind of response, the official said.        
	Analysts, however, differ. A number of exploration and production companies were re-evaluating their investment strategies because of a liquidity crunch to postpone NelpVIII. Oil explorers are not sure of investing in this sector as exploration is a highly capital-intensive proposition.         
	Bidding for oil blocks is under the new exploration licensing policy (Nelp). There have been seven rounds so far.        
	Several global majors such as Royal Dutch Shell, Exxon Mobil and Conoco Phillips have revisited their exploration and production plans globally and are keeping away from unexplored blocks.        
	Interestingly, the country plans to offer blocks around the time when Iceland will offer 100 blocks in the Dreki area of the North Atlantic.        
	About 4,00,000 sq km in acreage and over 100 blocks were to be awarded in NelpVIII, covering the western offshore, the Andaman offshore region, Mizoram, Bengal, Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Assam, Nagaland, Andhra Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Punjab, Maharashtra, Rajasthan, Jammu amp; Kashmir, Arunachal Pradesh, Orissa, Tripura, Manipur and Nagaland.        
	The next round may be conducted under an open acreage system that allows companies to identify the blocks or areas they want to explore instead of bidding for pre-assigned blocks.        
	The new system will be launched once the directorate general of hydrocarbons puts in place a national data repository that will house geological information of all basins and fields in the country.        
	The government has signed production sharing contracts for 44 oil and gas exploration blocks under NelpVII. The total committed investment for phase-I of exploration under NelpVII is about $1.5 billion.        
	So far, 206 blocks have been awarded in the seven rounds of bidding.

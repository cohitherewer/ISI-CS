	New Delhi, Oct. 15: Prime Minister Manmohan Singh today said more PSUs would list themselves on the bourses, hours after the cabinet allowed state-run Andrew Yule to sell its 26 per cent stake in Phoenix Yule  a joint venture with Germanys Phoenix  to Continental ContiTech for Rs 62.82 crore.         
	Our government is encouraging the listing of public sector enterprises on the stock markets as this will unlock the true value of companies, improve their corporate governance standards and help them raise resources for future expansion, Singh said at an awards ceremony organised by the Standing Conference of Public Sector Enterprises.         
	Oil India and NHPC recently came out with their initial public offerings. Other PSUs that propose to tap the capital markets are Coal India, NTPC, SAIL, Rural Electrification Corporation, Satluj Jal Vidyut Nigam and NMDC.         
	Singh said listed PSUs accounted for more than 24 per cent of the total market capitalisation of the BSE. Of the top 10 listed companies on the BSE, five are public sector enterprises.        
	This awards function is, in a way, a celebration of the achievements of the public sector. It is being held against the background of the global economic slowdown, which has affected large parts of the world and which has shown some signs of moderating only now, Singh said.        
	He said the government would try to restructure and revive loss-making PSUs.         
	Earlier in the day, information and broadcasting minister Ambika Soni said Andrew Yule would sell 1.19 crore shares in Phoenix Yule at Rs 49.50 apiece to Continental ContiTech         
	Andrew Yules partner in Phoenix Yule, Phoenix AG, which specialises in conveyer belts, is a subsidiary of Continental AG, as is Continental ContiTech.         
	The stake sale will make Phoenix Yule a 100 per cent German-owned firm.        
	Kallol Datta, chairman and managing director of Andrew Yule, said the money raised from the divestment would be used to repay part of the Rs 87-crore interest-free loan that the government had given to the company under a restructuring package.

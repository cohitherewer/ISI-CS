          OUR BUREAU                          Steel show                                  
	Calcutta/Bangalore, Nov. 23: ArcelorMittal has decided to try its luck down south after courting two eastern Indian states for nearly four years.        
	The company has applied to the Karnataka government on Saturday to build a 6-million-tonne plant and a power unit at an estimated investment of Rs 30,000 crore.        
	The proposal is in addition to the existing greenfield steel projects in Jharkhand and Orissa, an ArcelorMittal spokesperson said.        
	The company has proposed to build two 12-million-tonne plants at a cumulative investment of Rs 1 lakh crore in the two states.        
	However, it has neither been able to secure enough land nor did it get iron ore mines to kick off the two projects, which company chairman Lakshmi Mittal considered as central to ArcelorMittals growth plans.        
	The company today said it would take 3-4 months to complete technical studies to ascertain the exact size of the Karnataka project.        
	However, getting land and mine in Karnataka may not be easy either.        
	An official of the Karnataka government feels land acquisition will not be a problem. The state has given approvals for nine integrated steel projects in the northern districts  such as Bagalkot, Bellary and Koppal  between January and August.        
	Besides, the government has cleared some sponge iron and cement projects in these regions.        
	We have made a steel zone at Bellary and so more people are showing interest, the official said. The government would follow its policy of holding discussions with farmers and offer prices slightly higher than market rates. In that area, people want industries, he said.

	New Delhi, Oct. 26: India and the US are expected to sign a bilateral trade and investment treaty framework agreement during Prime Minister Manmohan Singhs visit to Washington next month.        
	Senior commerce ministry officials said the representatives of India and US were working together to protect the investments of entrepreneurs of both the countries to enhance trade ties. A framework agreement could be signed during Singhs visit to Washington on November 24, they added.        
	The two governments have agreed to work together on a framework for promoting real and meaningful co-operation in trade and investment. We will soon have an agreement on that, commerce minister Anand Sharma told reporters after a meeting with US trade representative Ron Kirk.        
	We would also like to see more improvement and openness in the investment environment for the US businesses in India, Kirk said.        
	Kirk said he discussed with Anand Sharma ways to improve trade and investment in infrastructure, healthcare, education, information technology and energy.        
	The two leaders, during their meeting, also agreed to support the greater involvement of small and medium enterprises in each others markets. Besides, they decided to pursue initiatives in Indias infrastructure, clean energy and environmental services, and information and communication technologies.        
	The framework agreement on trade and investment is seen as a precursor to any dialogue on a free trade agreement between the US and India.        
	The trade between the US and India has tripled over the last decade. However, Washingtons trade with New Delhi is less than 10 per cent of what it is with China. But, for India, the US is the largest trading partner.        
	With India representing the fastest growing middle-class economy, there is explosive potential both ways. So we want to look at issues that we can remove on either side that will help facilitate the growth of trade, Kirk said.        
	India traded a total of $43 billion of goods with the US in 2008, with a positive balance of $8 billion.

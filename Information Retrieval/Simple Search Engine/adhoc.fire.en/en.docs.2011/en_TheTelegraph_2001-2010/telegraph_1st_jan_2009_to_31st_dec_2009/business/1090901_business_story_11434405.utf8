                                                                                                               Fertiliser revamp
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Aug. 31: The government has set up a panel to revamp fertiliser subsidies and draw out a road map for offering them directly to farmers.        
	The panel headed by finance minister Pranab Mukherjee will also decide on the time frame to shift to the new regime, sources said.        
	The fertiliser ministry has convened meetings of senior officials from different states and the industry in September to make them aware of the proposed changes.        
	Under the present subsidy system, the government reimburses fertiliser companies for selling below costs to farmers.         
	After the change, fertilisers will be sold at market rates to farmers, who will be compensated.        
	In his budget speech, finance minister Pranab Mukherjee had said that subsidies had led to the heavy use of urea, which was harming soil fertility. He said after the changes, more of other fertilisers such as nitrogen, phosphorous and potash would be used.

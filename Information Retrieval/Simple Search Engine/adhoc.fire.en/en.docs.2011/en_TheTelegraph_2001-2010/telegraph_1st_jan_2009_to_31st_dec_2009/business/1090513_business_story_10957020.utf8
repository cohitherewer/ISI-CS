   March fall biggest in 16 years          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                                  
	New Delhi, May 12: Industry output contracted 2.3 per cent in March, the steepest in 16 years, severely impacted by the dismal performance of capital goods, textiles and garments.        
	For the whole of the last fiscal, industry grew 2.4 per cent, much lower than 8.5 per cent in 2007-08.        
	However, analysts said, the 2.4 per cent growth rate coupled with consumer industries expanding 4.4 per cent in the last fiscal were possible indicators of industry turning the corner.         
	The March contraction is mainly on account of a 3.3 per cent fall in manufacturing output, which accounts for nearly 80 per cent of the index of industrial production, against a 5.7 per cent increase in March 2008.         
	Cotton textiles shrank by over 10 per cent in March and by 2.8 per cent through the year. For wool and silk, it was an 8.2 per cent reduction in March and a 0.2 per cent fall through the year. Similarly, leather output was down 18 per cent for the month and 7 per cent for the year.         
	In the use-based classification of goods, capital goods saw the worst performance with the output during March contracting 8.2 per cent compared with a very high growth of 20 per cent in the corresponding month a year ago. Capital goods include machinery and equipment, which are used for producing items used by other industries or consumers.        
	The figures are likely to be closely monitored by the politicians of the Congress and BJP, who are both expecting to form a government at the Centre.         
	Former finance minister Yashwant Sinha said: The new government would have to take concrete steps to deal with the multi-dimensional crisis that the economy faces.         
	Analysts said several segments did well in March, and this was encouraging. Consumer durables grew 8.3 per cent against a negative 0.2 per cent growth a year ago, while power sector growth moved up to 6.3 per cent from 3.7 per cent a year ago.        
	Mining was a disappointment, expanding just 0.4 per cent against 4.9 per cent a year ago.        
	A pointer to better days was also provided by ABN Amro Bank purchasing managers index, which touched a high of 53.3 in April from 49.5 in March, the first month of expansion since last October. A reading above 50 signifies expansion. The boost in the index came from a surge in new orders and an improvement in domestic demand.        
	Data from car makers and cement firms also indicate the beginning of a rebound. Car sales increased 4.2 per cent in April after a 1 per cent gain in March, while cement production jumped 10.1 per cent.        
	However, many analysts and industry called for another stimulus package. A distinct break cannot come about without a spurt in investments and a radical improvement in the investment environment. For example, lending rates continue to remain high and act as a deterrent to fresh investments and fructification of planned projects, Harsh Pati Singhania, president of the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry, said.        
	According to N.R. Bhanumurthy of the Institute of Economic Growth, The pace of economic growth remains weak, but lead economic indicators point to a turnaround. We expect the IIP number to turn positive by the end of June as the full effects of stimulus packages would start showing results.        
	He said he did not expect the RBI to further cut rates, but the new government was likely to announce a set of fiscal measures in the budget in July, which would spur the economy.

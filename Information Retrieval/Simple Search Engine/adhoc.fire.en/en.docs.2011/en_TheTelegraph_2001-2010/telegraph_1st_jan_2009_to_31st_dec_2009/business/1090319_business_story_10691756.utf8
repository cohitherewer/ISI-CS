The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | IBM sets sights on Sun Micro
                                                                                                               IBM sets sights on Sun Micro

	New York, March 18: IBM is in talks to buy Sun Microsystems in a proposed deal valued at nearly $7 billion, a person with knowledge of the negotiations said on Wednesday.        
	Suns shares were up 65.3 per cent or $3.26 to $8.23, while IBM fell 2 per cent to $90.89.        
	The merger, if completed, would mark a big consolidation step in the market for server computers used in corporate data centres  and one that could prompt an antitrust challenge. Together, the two companies would have about 65 per cent of the market for server computers running the Unix operating system and 42 per cent of the total server market.        
	A combination of IBM, based in Armonk, New York, and Sun, based in Santa Clara, California, would bring together two companies with a large commitment to research and development spending and open software development. IBMs annual research and development budget is $6 billion, while Suns is $3 billion.        
	News of the talks between the two companies was first reported in The Wall Street Journal. Neither IBM nor Sun would comment.        
	If they reach a deal, it would be IBMs largest-ever acquisition, and represent a departure from its recent strategy of focusing on deals to strengthen its software and services businesses, rather than hardware.        
	Analysts saw the talks as part of a consolidation trend, as Hewlett-Packard, IBM and Cisco Systems jostle for control of corporate data centres and compete to supply the high-end computers that power complex corporate transactions and networks.        
	Sun created both the Solaris operating system, a version of Unix, and the Java Internet programming language. Both companies are big supporters of the open-source Linux operating system, a rival to Microsofts Windows in data centres and on some desktop personal computers.        
	It makes sense in an industry consolidation view, but looking at Suns performance over the last couple of years, its not one of my top picks for IBM to buy, said Jyske Bank analyst Robert Jakobsen, speaking from Denmark.        
	Having said that, theres clearly a huge synergy combining these two companies, he said.         
	Sun has long been cited as a takeover target for IBM, HP, Dell or Cisco, which introduced a comprehensive set of data centre products earlier this week.         
	Bankers have said Sun has been searching for a buyer in recent months.        
	Sun has struggled in recent years, but also held onto its heritage of innovation and investment in research. But that has kept its profits low.         
	Its gross profit margins are more than 40 per cent, but its operating profits have been close to zero in recent years, estimates A.M. Sacconaghi, an analyst at Sanford Bernstein.         
	IBM should be able to improve the margins, given the overlap in businesses and overhead expenses in these two companies, he said.        
	In January, Sun reported a loss of $209 million for the three months ended in December, weighed down by a $222-million restructuring charge. Without one-time charges, Sun earned $114 million, or 15 cents a share, down from $409 million, or 50 cents a share, in the comparable quarter a year ago.         
	Sales in the period fell nearly 11 per cent to $3.22 billion from $3.62 billion, but that was better than analysts estimates. In November, Sun announced that it was cutting as many as 6,000 of its 33,000 workers over the next year.        
	IBM had nearly $13 billion in cash at the end of 2008. Its largest acquisition to date is the $5-billion purchase of Canadian software maker Cognos last year.

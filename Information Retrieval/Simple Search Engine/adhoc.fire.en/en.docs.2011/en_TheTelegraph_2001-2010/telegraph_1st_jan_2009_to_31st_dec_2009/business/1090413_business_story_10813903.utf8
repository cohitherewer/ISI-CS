          SOUNAK MITRA                          Get, set, go                                  
	Calcutta, April 12: German automobile major Porsche is planning to set up an outlet in Calcutta by 2010.        
	We are hopeful of having a dealership in Calcutta by 2010, Rod Wallace, managing director of Precision Cars India, told The Telegraph.         
	At present, the company has two Porsche centres  in Mumbai and New Delhi.         
	Precision Cars India is the official importer of Porsche in the country.        
	Porsche is in talks with a few car dealers in Calcutta. We are evaluating dealership enquiries and the process can take time as we carefully select partners who share our passion and can provide the Porsche experience to customers, Wallace said.        
	A typical Porsche centre is spread over 4,000 square feet with trained staff to support customer needs. The passion for automobiles and a good financial track record are given high priority while choosing a dealer, Wallace said.         
	However, he declined to name the dealers. The Calcutta store, once open, will house all the models which are available in India.        
	Other centres        
	Porsche is also planning to expand to six other cities by the end of 2010.         
	The cities under consideration are Hyderabad, Bangalore, Chennai, Ahmedabad, Kochi, and Ludhiana, Wallace said.         
	The company hopes to set up these centres with carefully selected local partners that meet all the Porsche criteria and with fully trained and accredited staff , Wallace said.        
	Hybrid Cayenne         
	Porsche plans to unveil a hybrid version of the sports utility vehicle Cayenne in 2010. We will also introduce the first four-door sports car from Porsche, the new Panamera, in late 2009, Wallace said.        
	Porsche had earlier introduced the 2009 models for the Boxster and Cayman along with the race track car  the 911 GT3.         
	These cars are available in India through prior booking. India is on a par with all global markets for Porsche and we have all our models in India, Wallace said.

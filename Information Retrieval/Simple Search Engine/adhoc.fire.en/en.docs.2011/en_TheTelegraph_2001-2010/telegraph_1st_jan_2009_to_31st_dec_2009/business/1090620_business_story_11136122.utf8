                                                                                                               Steel to get RIL gas
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Mumbai, June 19: Private steel makers will now start receiving gas from Reliance Industries wells in the Krishna-Godavari basin.        
	Essar Steel, Ispat Industries and Vikram Ispat are scheduled to get around 3.75 million metric standard cubic metres of gas per day from RIL.         
	It is learnt that the ministry of petroleum and natural gas on Thursday issued orders directing RIL to sell the gas to the three steel makers at the government-mandated price of $4.20 per mBtu.        
	The order comes just three days after Bombay High Court ruled that Anil Ambani-owned Reliance Natural Resources Ltd had a legitimate claim to 28 million cubic metres of gas a day from the KG basin at a discounted price of $2.34 per mBtu for 17 years.

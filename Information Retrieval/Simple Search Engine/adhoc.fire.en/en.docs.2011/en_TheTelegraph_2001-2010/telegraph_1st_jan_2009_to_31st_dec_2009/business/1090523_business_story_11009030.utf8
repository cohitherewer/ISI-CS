The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | RBI wary of deficit effect on rates
                                                                                                               RBI wary of deficit effect on rates
          OUR BUREAU                          RBI governor Duvvuri Subbarao with JPMorgan India CEO Kalpana Morparia in Mumbai on Friday. (PTI)                                  
	Mumbai, May 22: Reserve Bank governor Duvvuri Subbarao is worried that a surge in the Centres fiscal deficit could badly constrain the central banks efforts to push for a low interest regime.        
	The Centre has tended to fund the gaping fiscal deficit  which rose to almost 6 per cent of GDP in the year ended March 31  through massive borrowings.        
	In the interim budget presented in February, stand-in finance minister Pranab Mukherjee had outlined plans to raise Rs 3,61,782.79 crore in 2009-10 an increase of almost 150 per cent over the budget estimate of Rs 1,45,146.04 crore in 2008.        
	The borrowing programme of the government has already expanded very rapidly. Large borrowing by the government runs against the low interest rates that the Reserve Bank is trying to maintain, to spur investment demand in keeping with the stance of the monetary policy, Subbarao told a business conference here today.        
	The Manmohan Singh-led UPA coalition is expected to come out with a revised budget by late June or early July. Bond traders and analysts are worried that the borrowing target will be raised to meet additional spending requirements.        
	In fact, this has already been done with respect to dated securities, or gilts. Back in March, the department of economic affairs in the finance ministry had put out an indicative calendar for the issue of gilts worth Rs 2,41,000 crore in the first half of the fiscal ended September 30.         
	But on Monday  its first working day  the new government decided in consultation with the RBI to increase the value of the securities to be offered through the two auctions between May 15 and May 29 from Rs 12,000 crore to Rs 15,000 crore. This decision was taken after a review of the emerging requirements of the government, market conditions and other relevant factors, the department said in a note.        
	The slump in the economy has put greater pressure on the new government to boost spending and pump prime a faltering economy.        
	Growth in the Indian economy slowed to below 7 per cent in 2008-09 after three years at or above 9 per cent. The forecast is that GDP growth could dip to a seven-year low of around 6 per cent in the current fiscal.        
	Last week, a bunch of professional forecasters consulted by the RBI projected the long term forecast of the real GDP over the next five years at 7 per cent, which was down from the 7.7 per cent estimated in the review carried out in the previous quarter.        
	The central bank has tried to kick start lending and, thereby, spur growth by slashing the key lending rate  the reverse repo  by 425 points since October. The central bank has tried to use moral suasion to force reluctant banks to trim their rates.         
	The first order of economic business for the new government will be the full budget. Given the status of the economy, the pressure to provide more stimulus will persist, Subbarao said.        
	Another stimulus package  the third since January  could lead to a rise in fiscal deficit which was estimated in the interim budget at Rs 3,32,835 crore (or 5.5 per cent of the GDP) in 2009-10.         
	With every percentage point increase in the fiscal deficit, maintaining adequate liquidity in the system becomes much more difficult. Managing this trade-off between our short-term compulsion and long-term sustainability will be one of the main challenges going forward, said Subbarao.        
	Subbarao was confident that the Indian economy would achieve the 6 per cent GDP growth that the RBI had forecast this year.

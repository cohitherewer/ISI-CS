The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Small stands tall
                                                                                                               Small stands tall
        A bearish market and lower interest rates on bank deposits have brought small savings schemes back in the reckoning, says Srikumar Bondyopadhyay                                            
	Small savings schemes are back in demand with the stock markets unlikely to recover in the immediate future and banks slashing interest rates on deposits.        
	Over the last few years, small savings schemes got overshadowed by the dazzling returns on equity investments and double-digit interest rates on bank deposits.         
	However, with the turn in the tide of events in the second half of the calendar year, equities lost enormous value, while bank deposit rates fell to the level of small savings schemes.         
	A number of banks also withdrew their special deposit schemes that offered between 10.50 per cent and 11 per cent interest rate per annum compared with 8 per cent for small savings schemes.         
	Rate rattle        
	Interest rates on bank deposits are likely to come down further with inflation falling below 4 per cent in the first week of February from a high of 13 per cent in August last year.         
	Low inflation levels will give the Reserve Bank of India enough room to reduce its key policy rates so that commercial banks are able to slash their lending rates further.         
	A lower cost of credit would in turn rev up demand in the economy.        
	Experts expect the apex bank to announce a 50-100 basis point cut in lending rates in March.        
	The government did not announce any stimulus measure for the slowing economy in its interim budget presented on February 16.         
	Hence, any initiative to prop up demand and economic growth in the next 4-5 months before a new government tables a full budget can only be through monetary measures taken by the Reserve Bank of India.         
	Now, any reduction in lending rates by commercial banks will be accompanied by a lowering of cost of deposits.         
	At present, banks are offering between 8.5 per cent and 9 per cent interest rate for fixed deposits with maturity between one and three years.         
	For deposits with longer maturity, the interest rate varies between 8 per cent and 8.5 per cent.         
	Leading private sector banks and some public sector biggies such as Punjab National Bank and the Bank of India are offering 7.75-8.25 per cent interest rate for deposits of more than five years.         
	Small savings schemes, which are essentially for more than five years, have thus become quite competitive offering an 8 per cent interest rate.         
	But, small savings schemes are more attractive as TDS is not applicable on them unlike bank deposits where tax on the interest income is deducted at source.        
	In the case of Public Provident Fund (PPF) offering an 8 per cent interest rate, the interest income is also tax-free under Section 10 of the Income Tax Act, while investment in the scheme enjoys tax reliefs under Section 80C.        
	The Post Office Monthly Income Scheme has also become lucrative after the 5 per cent bonus offer was brought back.         
	However, in the last couple of years, PPF lost out to equity-linked savings schemes of mutual funds and unit-linked insurance plans of life insurance companies because of the high returns churned by the latter.         
	Sheen lost        
	According to figures released by the finance ministry, the accretion to PPF (total contribution minus total withdrawals) in 2006-07 was Rs 18,534.60 crore.         
	This came down to Rs 12,578.62 crore in 2007-08 financial year. The revised estimates for 2008-09 stand at Rs 6,100 crore against the earlier estimate of Rs 12,200 crore.         
	For 2009-10, it is estimated that total collection under PPF will be Rs 15,000 crore, while total disbursements will be Rs 6,500 crore  a net accretion of Rs 8,500 crore.         
	The decline in net accretion to Public Provident Fund over the last few years indicates that more and more investors, particularly taxpayers, are shifting to ELSS and Ulips, which recorded huge growth in assets under management during this period.         
	However, with stocks being hammered on the bourses since January last year and showing no signs of recovery in the next one year, fund flow to both ELSS and Ulips have significantly come down.         
	Reversing trend        
	Net inflow of fund to ELSS for the year ended January 31, 2008, was Rs 3,304 crore against Rs 2,200 crore in the previous corresponding period. For the year ended January 31, 2009, net inflow to ELSS was Rs 2,137 crore.        
	The growth in first premium income of life insurance companies also suggest a similar sliding trend.         
	Premium income from sales of single premium policies has declined for both private life insurers and the Life Insurance Corporation between April and December 2008.         
	The LIC has witnessed a fall in policy sales, while the first premium income of private players grew only 18.15 per cent compared with triple-digit growth in the last few years.        
	In these difficult times, small savings schemes can be a safe bet as they ensure an assured return.

	Calcutta, Oct. 8: Japans NTT DoCoMo, which has a 26 per cent stake in Tata Teleservices, plans to set up a research and development centre in India.        
	We cannot give any time frame for the R amp;D centre, which is expected to come up in south India. But talks are at an advanced stage, Tata Teleservices managing director Anil Sardana said at the launch of Tata DoCoMo services here today.         
	Besides Japan, where the company is undertaking R amp;D work on Internet technologies, it has centres in the US, China and Germany.         
	On the pay-per-second concept, Sardana said it would bring relief to subscribers who had been paying about 20-25 per cent extra per month in phone bills.        
	Tata DoCoMo is the first to introduce the pay-per-second concept in the country.         
	Big brothers fear a projected revenue loss of 20-25 per cent. Why anybody will be interested in losing out revenues? But in the end, everybody has to follow the pay-per-second formula, he said.        
	A few days back, J.S. Sarma, chairman of the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India, had said, we may ask all the operators to consider per-second pulse as a mandatory tariff option along with their other tariff plans. Trai may soon come out with a consultation paper on the subject and invite suggestions.         
	Sistema Shyam  which offers services under the MTS brand  has chosen per-second billing as its entry strategy in the lucrative Delhi circle.        
	Vodafone Essar is testing the waters in the Madhya Pradesh circle. Aircel Cellular has opted for the per-second offer in Orissa, Bihar, Bengal, Calcutta and Kerala.

                                                                                                               ICICI cuts lending rates
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Crowd-puller                                  
	Mumbai, June 4: ICICI Bank today slashed its lending rates by 50 basis points, thereby reducing mortgage costs for its existing home loan borrowers.        
	Elsewhere, the State Bank of India said there was room for a 25-basis-point cut in both lending and deposit rates.        
	The surprise rate cut by the countrys second largest bank came just a day ahead of finance minister Pranab Mukherjees meeting with the chairmen of nationalised banks.         
	Mukherjee is expected to ask the bank chiefs to examine the possibility of bringing down interest rates. State-run banks are expected to trim rates this month  which would be the second big rate cut by leading PSU banks since January.        
	ICICI Bank today announced a reduction of 50 basis points in its floating reference rate, applicable to floating retail loans (including home loans), from June 5.        
	The revised floating rate will be 12.75 per cent against 13.25 per cent now. ICICI Bank added that all the existing floating rate retail loan customers would benefit from the rate cut.        
	The private sector bank also announced a similar reduction in its benchmark advance rate from June 5, 2009, a move that will benefit corporate borrowers. According to ICICI Bank, the revised benchmark advance rate will be 15.75 per cent against 16.25 per cent at present.        
	This is the second time that ICICI Bank is bringing down its rates this year. On April 21, the bank had brought down interest rates by 50 basis points soon after the Reserve Bank of India slashed both the repo and the reverse repo rate by 25 basis points to 4.75 per cent and 3.25 per cent, respectively, in its credit policy.        
	The repo is the rate at which the RBI provides funds to banks against the government securities they hold. The reverse repo is the rate at which the central bank absorbs liquidity.        
	Private sector banks such as ICICI Bank have been criticised for being extremely tardy in cutting rates in response to the aggressive benchmark rate reductions by the RBI.         
	Borrowers of the SBI can look forward to some good news over the next few days as chairman .P. Bhatt today said the bank had room to bring down lending and deposit rates by 25 basis points. Bhatt told reporters that the SBI could cut its rate this month.

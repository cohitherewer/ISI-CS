The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Dual MTN listing on govt radar
                                                                                                               Dual MTN listing on govt radar
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Mukherjee: Open mind                                  
	New Delhi, Sept. 15: The government today said it was open to the South African governments suggestion to list MTN Group Limited in India.         
	MTN, based near Johannesburg, is in exclusive talks with Indias Bharti Airtel for a $23-billion merger deal.        
	There is a provision for the dual listing of companies. The South African minister (Pravin Gordhan) met me at the G20 finance ministers meeting and there I suggested to him that this arrangement is to be looked into in the Indian context, finance minister Pranab Mukherjee said here today. There is no assurance as such, but I told him (Gordhan) that we will look into this matter and we will see what can be done.         
	Finance ministry officials, however, said they had not formally received a proposal for dual listing that would allow MTN to be traded both in India and South Africa with equal voting rights for its shareholders.        
	A Bharti Airtel spokesperson declined to comment on whether a delay in regulatory approval would be a roadblock before the deal or the exclusive talks would be extended beyond the end of this month.        
	Bharti and MTN have been negotiating since May for a deal allowing Bharti to pick up a 49 per cent stake in MTN, and the latter holding 36 per cent in Indias top mobile operator. The firms have extended talks twice.        
	The deal will have to clear several regulatory hurdles and requires shareholders endorsements in South Africa and India. The rules in South Africa require that 75 per cent of the shareholders must be present and voting to clear a merger.        
	Under the proposed deal, both firms would offer cash and equity to one another. MTN is offering $2.9 billion in cash and 25 per cent of its own equity to acquire a 25 per cent stake in Bharti.         
	Other MTN shareholders would buy another 11 per cent of the Indian firm, taking the total MTN shareholding to 36 per cent.         
	New Delhi-based Bharti, in turn, will hold 49 per cent in MTN through a cash-cum-share offer.        
	Several of MTNs shareholders have openly said that they wanted Bharti to offer a higher price. Sebi has already exempted MTN from making an open offer if the merger deal materialises, provided it does not convert its GDRs into equity.

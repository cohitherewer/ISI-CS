	Mumbai, May 12: The sensex surged to a seven-month high scaling the 12000-peak effortlessly once again as foreign institutional investors started to pour money into Indian equities ahead of Saturdays electoral results.        
	The bellwether index leapt 475 points or 4.1 per cent  the second biggest rally this year  to 12158.03, which is the highest close since October 3.        
	Reliance Industries, which is the heavyweight in the index, soared 5.3 per cent to Rs 1,959.90, while software giant Infosys rose 5.3 per cent to Rs 1,598.45.        
	Strong buying by foreign funds helped stocks shrug off early losses amid speculation that a strong, pro-reform political formation would emerge on Saturday.        
	There was a lot of basket buying and optimism about a positive election result with the NDA in command, said a stockbroker at a Mumbai-based firm.        
	Others said there seemed to be little chance of a third front government now. The market is comfortable with either the UPA or the NDA-led coalition. Both are expected to be stable formations that will continue to push reforms.        
	The S amp;P CNX Nifty also put on 3.6 per cent at 3681.10 points.        
	Foreign investors made net purchases of $251.9 billion on May 8, swelling their equity purchases this year to $1.03 billion, the market regulator said.        
	The Instanex FII index  a new index that tracks FII investment in the top 15 stocks on their radar  rose 4.83 per cent to 269.38. Significantly, the surge in this index is stronger than the bellwether indices.        
	The top five stocks that the FIIs seem to favour right now are Reliance Industries, Bharti Airtel, HDFC, Infosys Technologies and ICICI Bank.        
	Of the 15 stocks in the Instanex FII Index, 14 were up and just Hindustan Unilever was down.        
	The tech sector was the second-best performer in todays rally, gaining 5.04 per cent to 2297.63, following a steep rise in the shares of Bharti Airtel (6 per cent), Idea Cellular (5.57 per cent) and Zee Enterprise (5.24 per cent).        
	The banking index rose 4.83 per cent to 6250.68 as scrips of leading lenders  ICICI Bank, HDFC Bank, Axis Bank and the SBI  surged.

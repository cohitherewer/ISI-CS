          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Mumbai, Dec. 4: Reliance Industries is venturing into deep-water oil exploration in Colombia.        
	Reliance Exploration and Production DMCC, a subsidiary of RIL, has signed an agreement with Ecopetrol SA, the Colombian state-owned oil company, under which it has acquired a majority interest in two deepwater blocks covering an area of 8,000 square kms in water depths ranging from 60 to 1,500 metres.        
	Under the terms of the deal, Ecopetrol will pick up a 20 per cent stake in two blocks in Colombia. Reliance will hold the rest and will be the operator of these blocks.        
	RILs Colombian venture is part of its plan to bring about a better balance between domestic and international operations.         
	At its annual general meeting held last month, chairman Mukesh Ambani had said Reliance had 99,000 square km of acreage in Oman, Yemen, Colombia, East Timor and Peru. He had added that the overseas oil and gas initiatives would reinforce its domestic efforts.        
	The company has commenced drilling of its first overseas offshore exploratory well as an operator, in the deep waters of Oman Block 18. In Yemen, the average production in the Yemen Block 9 is 4,200 barrels of oil per day.        
	In Colombia, Reliance Exploration and Ecopetrol have signed the farm-out agreements, effective from November 23, for Borojo North Block 42 and Borojo South Block 43, subject to the approval from ANH, the Colombian national upstream regulator.        
	Reliance has planned an aggressive exploration campaign aimed at diversifying its search for new accumulations over the next three years.         
	While it plans to drill in a majority of its blocks, the E amp;P campaign in the Krishna-Godavari basin will also be accelerated.

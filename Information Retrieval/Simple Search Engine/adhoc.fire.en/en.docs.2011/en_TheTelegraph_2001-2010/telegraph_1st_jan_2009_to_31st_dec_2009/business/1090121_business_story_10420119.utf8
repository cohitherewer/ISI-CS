The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Fiat picks up 35% in Chrysler 
                                                                                                               Fiat picks up 35% in Chrysler 
          NICK BUNKLEY                           Strategic move                                   
	Detroit, Jan. 20: Fiat, the Italian auto maker, agreed on Tuesday to take a 35 per cent stake in struggling American auto company Chrysler, which was forced last month to seek a federal bailout amid fears it might not survive.        
	The deal, announced by Fiat at its headquarters in Turin, and by Chrysler in Auburn Hills, means Chrysler will have significant foreign ownership again after only 18 months as an independent company. Cerberus Capital Management bought Chrysler in 2007, after it was put up for sale by Daimler of Germany. The two companies operated as DaimlerChrysler for nine years.        
	The agreement will allow Chrysler to use Fiats technology and vehicle platforms to build more fuel-efficient, small and midsize cars at its factories and sell them in North America. Fiat will give Chrysler access to distribution networks in other parts of the world, particularly Europe. The companies said they expect substantial cost savings opportunities but did not specify an amount.        
	Chrysler, which last month received a $4-billion loan from the federal government to help it avoid bankruptcy, said the partnership would be a key element of the viability plan that it must submit by March 31 and that Fiat would help develop the plan.         
	This initiative represents a key milestone in the rapidly changing landscape of the automotive sector and confirms Fiat and Chryslers commitment and determination to continue to play a significant role in this global process, the chief executive of Fiat, Sergio Marchionne, said in a statement.        
	Chryslers agreement comes several months after merger talks with General Motors were abandoned as the market deteriorated. Last year, Chrysler reached a deal to build pickup trucks for Nissan-Renault, which would in turn build small cars for Chrysler. But the status of that arrangement is now unclear; Renault is a chief rival of Fiat in Europe.        
	Fiat, which stopped selling cars in the United States in 1983, does not plan to make a cash investment in Chrysler or commit to funding Chrysler in the future, the companies said in the joint statement.         
	For Fiat, the deal could mark a return to the only global market where it does not compete.         
	This transaction will enable Chrysler to offer a broader competitive line-up of vehicles for our dealers and customers that meet emissions and fuel efficiency standards, while adhering to conditions of the government loan, Chryslers chairman, Robert L. Nardelli, said.        
	Toyota head        
	Toyota Motor, the Japanese auto giant, on Tuesday named Akio Toyoda, the grandson of the companys founder, as its next president, returning to its roots as it faces the roughest downturn in more than 70 years.        
	The appointment of Mr. Toyoda, 52, was widely expected as part of a management reshuffling at the company, which expects its first full-year operating loss since his grandfather started the company in 1937. The last family member to lead the company was his uncle, Tatsuro Toyoda, who stepped down in 1995.

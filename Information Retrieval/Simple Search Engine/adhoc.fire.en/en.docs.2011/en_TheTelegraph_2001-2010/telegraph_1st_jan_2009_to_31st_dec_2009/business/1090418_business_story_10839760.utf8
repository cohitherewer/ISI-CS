The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Citi stages comeback with quarterly profit
                                                                                                               Citi stages comeback with quarterly profit
          MATTHEW SALTMARSH                           Vikram Pandit: Breathe easy                                   
	New York, April 17: Citigroup has announced a first-quarter net profit on Friday after more than a year of staggering losses and three rescues from Washington.         
	The New York-based bank reported first-quarter net income of $1.6 billion, after posting a loss of $5.11 billion in the year-ago period. Revenue was $24.8 billion, up 99 per cent.         
	The earnings were helped by an accounting change that allowed the bank to post a one-time gain of $2.5 billion. Under the rule, companies are allowed to record any decline in the market value of their debt as an unrealised gain.         
	Citigroup announced a loss of 18 cents per share. Analysts had expected a loss of 34 cents a share on revenue of $22.9 billion.         
	We are pleased with our performance, CEO Vikram Pandit said. With revenues of nearly $25 billion and net income of $1.6 billion, we had our best overall quarter since the second quarter of 2007.         
	The banks institutional clients group, which includes its investment banking unit, had a profit of $2.83 billion after a loss of $6.3 billion a year ago. The client group had a revenue of $9.5 billion, led by the fixed-income trading unit with $4.69 billion in revenue and equity trading with $1.9 billion.        
	Consumer banking lost $1.2 billion, because of increased credit losses, including mortgage loans. Profit from the credit card unit dropped about 66 per cent, to $417 million. The strength of Latin America offset losses in Europe and North America.         
	Citigroup said its operating expenses fell 23 per cent from the first quarter of 2008 and that it had reduced its work force by about 13,000, to 309,000, since the fourth quarter 2008. The cost of credit increased 76 per cent to $10.3 billion, including $7.3 billion in net credit losses and a $2.7 billion increase in reserves for future loan losses.        
	Helped by government infusions of capital, the banks Tier 1 capital ratio was approximately 11.8 per cent in the first quarter against 7.7 per cent a year earlier.         
	Just three months ago, many of the biggest US banks were on life support.         
	Now, several are showing glimpses of recovery, aided by a tentative improvement in some corners of the economy and new business picked up from rivals that have stumbled. On Thursday, JPMorgan Chase became the latest bank, after Goldman Sachs and Wells Fargo, to announce strong profits in the first quarter.         
	JPMorgan reported a $2.1-billion profit, beating analysts average forecasts. Revenue increased to $25 billion, up 45 per cent from $16.9 billion in the period last year.         
	Banks are enjoying a fresh wave of profits from the governments efforts to nurse the industry back to life. Ultra-low interest rates have led flocks of consumers to seek deals on mortgage loans. Investment banking and trading activities are enjoying a bounce from the billions of dollars spent to thaw frozen credit markets.         
	And even before the results of a new health test for the nations 19 largest banks are unveiled, those who can flaunt an improvement from their dismal recent performance are quickly trying to free themselves from government money.         
	On Tuesday, Goldman Sachs raised $5 billion of fresh capital in anticipation of repaying the governments investment.

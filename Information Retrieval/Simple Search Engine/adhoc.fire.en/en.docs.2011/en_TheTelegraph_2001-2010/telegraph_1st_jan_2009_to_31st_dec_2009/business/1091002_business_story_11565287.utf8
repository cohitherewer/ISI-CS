The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Glimmer of hope for Bharti
                                                                                                               Glimmer of hope for Bharti
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Oct. 1: The South African Treasury wants to discuss with Indian finance ministry officials regulatory norms for cross-border deals between companies of the two nations.         
	The move brings hope to Bharti Airtel, which is keen to expand to Africa  one of the few places other than India where the telecom market is expanding at a rapid pace.        
	Analysts said closed door talks might continue between Bharti and MTN as they try to overcome various regulatory hurdles to salvage the deal.        
	In a statement, the South African Treasury said both Indian and South African finance ministries were committed to working closely to lay the basis for the development of mutually beneficial mechanisms for such mergers.        
	The National Treasury has invited our Indian counterparts to South Africa to work towards a framework to support the growth and expansion of firms in both countries, the statement said.        
	Finance ministry officials said while the government had always supported cross-border deals, legal and regulatory issues had to be taken care of, not just for the Bharti-MTN deal but as a whole for all such future initiatives.        
	Negotiations for the $23-billion merger between Bharti and MTN were abandoned yesterday after the South African government refused to budge from its demand that MTN be listed on Indian bourses.         
	Dual listing, which is not allowed by Indian law, would have enabled MTN and Bharti to have a separate legal existence and separate shareholders, a move that the South African government feels is essential to retain MTNs national identity.         
	While the Indian government is open to the idea of a dual listing, it will take time to be operational as it needs regulatory changes, including capital account convertibility.        
	The South African Treasury said the government would support local companies that want to diversify offshore from a domestic base.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | PM pitches for simpler food tax
                                                                                                               PM pitches for simpler food tax
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Manmohan Singh in New Delhi on Tuesday. (PTI)                                  
	New Delhi, Oct. 6: Prime Minister Manmohan Singh today stressed the need to rationalise and simplify the tax structure for processed food to encourage private investment.        
	I recognise that we need to look at the taxation structure. Though primary agricultural commodities are mostly out of the tax purview, there are multiple levies on processed foods, he said, while addressing a conference of state food processing ministers here today.        
	He, however, did not elaborate on the changes that could be made. The government is expected to review the tax rates in the next budget.        
	States should work towards the early implementation of the goods and services tax (GST), while removing subjectivity in the treatment and classification of food products, he said.        
	The finance ministry has set April 2010 as the deadline to implement the GST that will help in lowering the tax burden on the industry by replacing multiple levies such as the excise and service tax.        
	Singh urged firms to increase their presence in the food processing industry and build global brands.        
	Expanding private investment is also necessary in building rural on-farm infrastructure such as primary processing centres, collection centres and cold chains. We should reflect on how best we can increase private investment in these areas.        
	He said food processing  which grew at an impressive 14.7 per cent in 2008-09 despite the economic slowdown  had the potential to transform the rural economy.        
	The government plans to come out with a national food processing policy to accelerate growth and increase farm income.        
	India is among the leading producers of some farm products globally, but the absence of a vibrant food processing industry leads to massive wastage and has restricted the countrys share in world food trade to less than 2 per cent.        
	Indias share in world food trade is less than 2 per cent. The level of processing in India is abysmally low at around 6 per cent compared with 60-80 per cent in developed countries, Singh said.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Tata Motors vice-chairman Ravi Kant (left) with chief financial officer C. Ramakrishnan in Mumbai on Friday. (Fotocorp)                                   
	Mumbai, Nov. 27: Tata Motors has clawed back to black by posting a consolidated net profit of Rs 21.78 crore during the second quarter of the current fiscal against a loss of Rs 941.75 crore in the corresponding period a year ago.        
	The company was helped by a strong performance in the domestic market even as it undertook various measures to pare costs at Jaguar Land Rover (JLR).        
	However, for the half year ended September 30, the company has suffered a loss of Rs 307 crore against Rs 222.06 crore in the year-ago period.        
	Net sales stood at Rs 20,889.44 crore compared with Rs 22,825.05 crore a year ago.        
	Analysts are of the view that the performance is not just a flash in the pan and will be sustained in the coming months as the environment in India and overseas has improved.        
	JLRs wholesale volume grew 23 per cent during the second quarter. The operating profit stood at 41 million, while net losses narrowed down to 60 million from 64 million in the corresponding year-ago period.        
	Tata Motors said the good show by JLRs was attributed to a model-mix with a focus on higher margin vehicles.         
	Moreover, cost-cutting measures are also expected to yield benefits. The company said its business was witnessing some stability because of recovery in some key markets.         
	Profits in associate firms have also contributed to the performance of Tata Motors.         
	On the BSE, the Tata Motors scrip ended at Rs 629.50, down 0.84 per cent from its previous close.                     
	Though Tata Motors did not elaborate on this aspect, the company posted a profit of Rs 19.69 crore against a loss of Rs 7.71 crore in the same period last year.              
	While the results came towards the close of market hours, the Tata Motors scrip ended lower by 2.2 per cent at Rs 620.70 at the BSE today. However, analysts expect the scrip bounce back when trading resumes next week.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | SingTel affinity for Bharti 
                                                                                                               SingTel affinity for Bharti 
          JAYATI GHOSE                              
	New Delhi, Aug. 13: SingTel is exploring ways to retain its 30 per cent stake in Bharti Airtel, which is working on a merger with MTN that can lower the Singapore firms holding by around 11-19 per cent.        
	Bharti Airtel contributed over 24 per cent to SingTels total income in the April-June quarter, boosting the Singapore firms net profit by 7.7 per cent.        
	Sources said SingTel was keen to retain at least 26 per cent in Bharti, a crucial level that gives shareholders a greater say in a companys operations.        
	Bharti is an important and established partner for SingTel. So, there will be some internal arrangement by which its shareholding in the Bharti-MTN merged entity remains at a comfortable level, Romal Shetty, telecom analyst at KPMG, told The Telegraph.         
	Banking sources said SingTel might look at buying shares in Bharti Airtel from the MTN shareholders to maintain its shareholding.        
	Under the proposed deal between Bharti and MTN, the Indian company will issue fresh shares, most likely in the form of global depository receipts (GDRs). These can be subsequently converted into ordinary Bharti Airtel shares.        
	A SingTel spokesperson said, We dont comment on market speculations.         
	Both India and South Africa are lucrative markets, and the merger allows SingTel to enter new markets. Therefore, it will ensure that it remains a strategic partner and a significant shareholder, said Shetty.        
	As established markets such as Singapore and the Philippines become saturated, SingTel is counting on Bharti to tap countries with high growth potential. For the April-June 2009 quarter, Bharti contributed a substantial 24 per cent to SingTels net profit of $652 million.        
	This (first) quarter, higher contributions from our regional mobile associates, in particular, Telkomsel (Indonesia) and Bharti, helped to drive the groups earnings, despite the negative currency impact, said Lim Chuan Poh, CEO of SingTel International.         
	Bharti will be a key determinant of SingTels fortunes, wrote Terence Wong, head of research at DMG amp; Partners Securities. We believe that the shareholders will be rewarded in the long term with the merger between Bharti and MTN.         
	However, some analysts contend that while the Bharti-MTN deal takes the Singapore company to new markets, it is not clear when the deal will add to SingTels bottomline.         
	A Macquarie report says any dilution of SingTels holding in Bharti can reduce its earnings by around 1-3 per cent in the next two fiscal years to March 2011. The additional debt that Bharti may need to complete the deal will also hurt Singtels earnings, said analysts.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | For painless pension
                                                                                                               For painless pension
        The New Pension Scheme may charm you with its low risk content but there are other ways to build and help grow your retirement kitty, says Srikumar Bondyopadhyay                                            
	If you are a non-government employee, pension schemes of life insurance companies have so long been your only choice for securing your future post retirement. Mutual funds are another option but not many are keen to take this route. The government has recently introduced the New Pension Scheme (NPS), which offers a third alternative.         
	Under NPS for central government employees who joined service on or after January 1, 2004, the employer (in this case the government) has to match the employees contribution to the fund as in the old pension system.         
	The tweak this time is that the monthly pension amount will no longer be predetermined.         
	However, for non-government employees, the employer will be under no obligation to match the employees contributions.         
	Let us now consider the other better options to help your retirement income grow.        
	Conventional route        
	Non-government employees who make monthly subscriptions to the Employees Provident Fund have the option of getting a pension via the Employees Pension Scheme (launched in 1995) after the age of 58. But there are some restrictions both on the monthly pension amount and the eligibility to get it.         
	Under current regulations, an employer contributes 8.33 per cent of an employees pensionable salary (basic plus dearness allowance) towards the Employees Pension Scheme (EPS).         
	The employees contribution to the EPS is 3.67 per cent.         
	However, there is a maximum limit of Rs 6,500 on the pensionable salary for EPS contribution. A higher limit is permitted if the employer contributes (at the rate of 8.33 per cent) on the salary amount in excess of Rs 6,500 a month.        
	To be eligible for a monthly pension after the age of 58, an employee has to contribute to the EPS for 10 years.         
	The monthly amount will then be the average monthly pensionable salary drawn during the 12 months just before the month of retirement multiplied by a pensionable service in years divided by 70.         
	Thus, if your monthly pensionable salary is Rs 6,500 and pensionable service is for 35 years, you shall get Rs 3,250 a month (6,500x35=227,500; 227,500/70= 3,250) as pension after the age of 58.         
	This is too small a monthly income to meet ones expenses after retirement.        
	Buy annuities        
	You can increase your monthly pension income by buying annuities from life insurance companies with a lumpsum investment.         
	At present, life insurance companies are giving annuity rates between 6.5 and 7.5 per cent. You can get annuities immediately after the age of 40. But lower the age of the annuitant, the lower is the monthly annuity amount.         
	The annuity rates at any point of time depend on the market rate of interest.         
	If the market interest rate comes down, the annuity rates will also decline and vice-versa. At the current rates, you need to invest about Rs 12.5 lakh to get an annuity of Rs 7,000 a month after 60 years of age.        
	Thus, to assure a monthly pension of Rs 10,000, including the income from EPS, you need to fork out Rs 12.5 lakh from your retirement kitty after working for 35 years.         
	Even under the New Pension Scheme, an investor will have to buy annuities from ones accumulated fund.        
	Slow and steady        
	The basic premise of a retirement plan, therefore, is to build a retirement kitty as much as possible through regular savings.        
	Since this fund has to be grown over a long period of time and with small monthly savings, it is important to select the proper instruments as different asset classes have different risk-return profile.         
	The ideal asset allocation strategy should be to follow a lifecycle plan  higher exposure to equities when one is young and gradually shifting to debt and fixed income securities as one approaches retirement.         
	So far, unit-linked insurance plans (Ulips) and systematic investment in equity mutual funds provided one with an opportunity to raise ones exposure in equities to 100 per cent.         
	Limited exposure        
	The NPS may disappoint those who wish for a higher investment in equities.         
	The scheme allows a maximum equity exposure of 50 per cent.         
	Moreover, the money under the equity option will have to be invested in index funds that track either the BSE Sensex or Nifty 50.         
	Equities of individual companies often do better than the composite index and here lies the benefits of active portfolio management and the fund managers expertise in stock selection.         
	Ulips give a better yield than any of the two composite indices. Though the fund management fee in Ulips is slightly less than mutual funds, they charge other fees such as mortality charges, agents commission and fund allocation fee.         
	For mutual funds, you wont have to pay any entry load if you buy directly from the fund house.         
	You only have to pay the fund management cost that varies between 1.5 per cent and 2.5 per cent.         
	The fund management fee in NPS is extremely low  90 paise per Rs 1 lakh of assets under management.         
	Besides, each investor in NPS will have to pay a fee towards the central depository for record keeping.         
	For those who want to play it safe, the NPS may be the desired route with its mix of equity, government securities, corporate bonds and bank deposits.         
	But, if you are willing to take a little more risk through a greater equity exposure for higher growth of the accumulated fund, NPS may not be the right pick.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Sterlite to offer more for Asarco 
                                                                                                               Sterlite to offer more for Asarco 
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          REWORKING PLAN                                  
	Calcutta, June 15: Sterlite Industries is likely to sweeten its bid for bankrupt copper miner Asarco LLC.        
	The Indian company is expected to increase the debt portion of its bid from $600 million to $770 million.        
	Sterlite had offered to pay $1.1 billion in cash and $600 million in promissory notes in March for the company which is based in Tucson in the US state of Arizona.         
	It is fighting a three-way bid battle with Asarcos former promoter Grupo Mexico and hedge fund Harbinger Capital for the control of the company.        
	Sterlite, owned by London Stock Exchange-listed Vedanta Resources Plc of NRI billionaire Anil Agarwal, would also pay more to the creditors claiming damages on environmental grounds.         
	The creditors are seeking compensation for exposure to asbestos arising from Asarcos operations.        
	The development comes days after Grupo increased its bid to $2.9 billion, including $1.3 billion in cash.        
	Last month, Harbinger Capital, one of Asarcos largest bond holders, joined the fight for the struggling copper miner with a $500-million reorganisation bid.        
	Mexicos largest miner Grupo had lost control of Asarco when the latter filed for bankruptcy in 2005 amid more than $1 billion of claims for causing harm to the environment.        
	Asbestos creditors had been favouring Grupo over Sterlite as they were convinced that they would benefit more if the Mexican company regained control. However, a bankruptcy court in the US state of Texas last week allowed Asarco to settle environment claims worth $1.1 billion from state agencies. It took the steam out of Grupos bid, to an extent.

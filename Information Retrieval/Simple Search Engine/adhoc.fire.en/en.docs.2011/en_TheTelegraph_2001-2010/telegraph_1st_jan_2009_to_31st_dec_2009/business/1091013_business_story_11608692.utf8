          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                           Decks cleared                                  
	Mumbai, Oct. 12: Standard Chartered plc has received the Reserve Bank of Indias approval to issue Indian depository receipts (IDRs).         
	However, the British bank has not yet filed a draft red herring prospectus with the Securities and Exchange Board of India because the RBI has imposed certain conditions.         
	Neeraj Swaroop, Standard Chartereds chief executive officer (India amp; South Asia), said there were certain issues that needed to be discussed with the RBI and the market regulator.         
	We will engage with both the RBI and Sebi and announce it at the right time, he said.         
	The IDRs are akin to global depository receipts and enable foreign firms to raise money from India.         
	Though the concept of IDRs was mooted around seven years ago, it has not yet got off to a start. Standard Chartereds IDR could potentially be the first such issue.        
	According to market circles, foreign firms could follow Standard Chartered if the float was successful.         
	Sebi has also been taking steps to make IDRs attractive. Recently, it allowed retail investors to subscribe to a maximum of 30 per cent of an IDR issue and introduced the concept of anchor investors.         
	Standard Chartered expects to raise anywhere between $500 million and $1 billion through IDRs. The RBI, however, has imposed a condition that the bank can raise only up to 5 per cent of its capital from a single IDR issue.         
	Indiabulls float        
	The IPO of Indiabulls Power got off to a solid start today with the issue being subscribed nearly 5.95 times.         
	Data from the NSE showed that against the total issue size of 2,78,636,000 shares, the issue generated bids for 1,65,6788,550 shares.         
	The offer, which will close on Thursday, has a price band of Rs 40-45 per share.         
	Against 1,42,716,000 shares reserved for qualified institutional investors, the number of bids stood at 1,55,048,9100 shares. In the non-institutional category, the issue was subscribed a little over two times.        
	The strong response defies the recommendations of a leading brokerage.        
	Indiabulls Power is in the process of developing 6,615MW thermal power capacity in Maharashtra and Chhattisgarh.

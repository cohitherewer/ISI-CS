	Mumbai, June 23: Tech Mahindra Ltd plans to raise up to Rs 1,015 crore by selling 1.36 crore equity shares through a private placement.        
	On Tuesday, Tech Mahindra chairman Anand Mahindra also announced the appointment of C.P. Gurnani as the chief executive officer of Mahindra Satyam and Sanjay Karla as the CEO of Tech Mahindra. Vineet Nayyar will be the executive vice-chairman of Mahindra Satyam as well as Tech Mahindra. S. Durgashankar has been appointed as the chief financial officer of Mahindra Satyam.        
	These executive appointments will help the respective companies leverage their immense global experience across different verticals in their quest to take an unassailable lead, said Mahindra.        
	Back in April, Tech Mahindra bought a 31 per cent stake in the fraud-tainted Satyam Computer Services through an auction for Rs 1,756 crore. Satyam Computer Services was re-branded as Mahindra Satyam last week.        
	Gurnani said Mahindra Satyam had four immediate priorities  to strengthen corporate governance, enhance customer satisfaction, regain market share and build the brand. Gurnani had, so far, been heading Tech Mahindras global operations, sales and marketing functions.         
	Sanjay Kalra is Tech Mahindras president for strategic initiatives. S. Durgashankar is currently a senior vice-president of mergers and acquisitions at M amp;M.         
	Vineet Nayyar provides strategic direction and a road map for Tech Mahindra, said a company statement.        
	In a notice to the Bombay Stock Exchange today, Tech Mahindra said it planned to raise funds either through a private placement or a qualified institutional placement. It hasnt yet decided on the exact amount of shares to be offered, or the price.

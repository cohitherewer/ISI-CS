	Calcutta, April 11: Small and medium steel companies in India are looking for iron ore and coal mines in Australia.        
	Asset prices have come down to a reasonable level now. Many small and medium companies are now scouting for opportunities, Partha Sen, business development manager (eastern India) for the Australian Trade Commission, said.        
	Industry sources said local steel makers such as Adhunik Metaliks and Concast were looking to acquire coal mines in Australia.        
	So far only large companies like Tata Steel, AV Birla Group and Bhushan Steel had bought stakes in Australian mines.         
	Gujarat NRE Coke, a Calcutta-headquartered company, also owns and operates coal mines in Australia.

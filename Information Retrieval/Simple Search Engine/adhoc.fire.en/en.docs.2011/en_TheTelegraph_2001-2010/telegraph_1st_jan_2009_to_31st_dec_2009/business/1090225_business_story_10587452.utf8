The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Tax relief for BPOs
                                                                                                               Tax relief for BPOs
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                          Bring cheer                                  
	New Delhi, Feb. 24: The government has said that the work of BPO firms will be treated as exports if the benefits accrue outside India, making the industry eligible for reliefs.        
	Call centres engaged by foreign firms who attend to calls from customers or prospective customers from around the world, including India, where the benefit of the service accrues outside India, would be considered as export, said Gautam Bhattacharya, commissioner service tax, Central Board of Excise and Customs.        
	The service tax authorities had earlier asked leading BPO firms including Convergys, Genpact and Vertex to return the refunds on claims made before March 2007.         
	The department had then argued that services provided by BPOs didnt amount to export as these were delivered in India. The objection was made due to the interpretation of the amendments made to the export of service rules in 2006.         
	BPOs would now again be in a position to claim refunds on inputs used in their work.         
	This is not the first time that ambiguities have cropped up vis--vis tax and services exports. Industry bodies had time and again asked the government to bring about clarity.

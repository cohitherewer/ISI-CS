          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT AMP; AGENCIES                          D. Subbarao in Hyderabad on Friday. (PTI)                                  
	Hyderabad, Aug. 14: Reserve Bank governor D. Subbarao today said making monetary policy independent of fiscal policy was an important reform measure for the country.         
	Co-ordination between monetary and fiscal policies has become a challenge, he said.         
	The governments huge borrowing programme is coming in the way of the monetary policy objective of a lower interest rate regime, he said.        
	The Reserve Bank cut its policy rates several times since October hoping interest rates will come down, but the borrowing programme has militated against it, Subbarao said at a function here.        
	He said the prevailing drought situation was a major cause for concern as there could be an upward pressure on inflation.        
	However, the situation was not grave enough for the central bank to introduce steps to contain inflation.         
	I am unable to say how the drought situation will translate into a crisis and what action will have to be taken at what point of time.         
	In the July review of its monetary policy, the central bank had revised its inflation forecast to around 5 per cent by the end of March 2010 from 4 per cent projected earlier.         
	Fake note battle        
	The country will soon get a new facility to make paper used in currency notes.         
	The Government of India and the RBI have resolved to set up a modern facility to produce paper for currency notes in the country. Though there is a facility right now at Hoshangabad in Madhya Pradesh, it is an old one. The new facility was intended to check fake currency notes, Subbarao said.        
	He also refuted reports that fake notes of a value of Rs 1.65 lakh crore are in circulation in the country.

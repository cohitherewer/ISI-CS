                                                                                                               Rumour ravages Rolta scrip 
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Mumbai, Jan. 13: Shares of Rolta India Ltd  an IT solutions provider specialising in geospatial information systems  today sank nearly 60 per cent in intra-day trading as rumours swirled that lenders were dumping pledged shares, an eerie reminder of Satyams first brush with trouble.         
	The scrip, however, recovered from these lows after clarifications from the management that there was nothing wrong with the company.        
	Rolta shares hit an intra-day low of Rs 42.40, down steeply from the opening trade of Rs 107.90. There were reports that Goldman Sachs which holds 3.5 per cent of the stock  had been selling the shares.        
	However, Merrill Lynch sold around 10 lakh Rolta shares at Rs 68.41 apiece on the National Stock Exchange.        
	It is learnt that around 2.5 per cent of the companys equity has been pledged with various nationalised and private sector banks.        
	Rumours were also rife that the promoters of the company were selling their stakes.         
	The companys clarification appeared to have had some effect and the stock closed at Rs 87.15, a fall of 17.71 per cent from Mondays close.

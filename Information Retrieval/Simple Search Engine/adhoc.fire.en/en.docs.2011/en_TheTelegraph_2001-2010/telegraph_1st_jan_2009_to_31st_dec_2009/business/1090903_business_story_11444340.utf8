The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Bid to hasten Doha talks
                                                                                                               Bid to hasten Doha talks
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Sept. 2: World leaders are demonstrating the political will to conclude the Doha round of trade talks by next year, Australian trade minister Simon Crean said today.         
	Crean and representatives of 34 other countries are here for a two-day mini-ministerial meeting of the World Trade Organisation starting tomorrow. Prior to the meeting, officials of 35 countries today held discussions among themselves.         
	As far as the Doha round is concerned, we are very close to its conclusion. We are now in the end-game of the negotiations, Crean said at an industry event.        
	He said Indian and US co-operation was vital to the conclusion of the Doha round. At the April G20 summit in London, the world leaders had set 2010 as the deadline to conclude the talks, mandating their trade ministers to oversee the negotiations.         
	The WTO ministerial meeting in July last year succeeded in solving 80 per cent of the outstanding issues. But, there is still 20 per cent to go and these are mostly hard political issues. The reality is that most of the outstanding issues will only be resolved with political input, he said.         
	The Delhi meeting is critical to the success of the trade talks in Pittsburgh this month.        
	However, the Left leaders have warned the Indian government against any move that will hurt the interest of the farmers.        
	Commerce minister Anand Sharma today met key ministers from the US, the European Union, Australia, Brazil, China, South Africa and Canada.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                            
	Mumbai, Dec. 7: After affordable housing, its now time for affordable safe water.        
	The $71-billion Tata group today launched a water purifier that is targeted at the bottom of the pyramid.         
	Tata Swach  the purifier that went into production after a decade of research by Tata Chemicals, Tata Consultancy Services and Titan Industries  comes in two variants priced at Rs 749 and Rs 999, respectively.         
	The Tatas hope that the product, which uses paddy husk ash to remove disease-carrying germs and is embedded with nano silver particles, will reduce the high incidence of water-borne diseases and deaths that occur every year.         
	Tata Sons chairman Ratan Tata said, Safe drinking water is the most basic of human needs. Although todays announcement is about giving millions more people affordable access to safe water, it is an important step in the long-term strategy to provide affordable access to safe water for all.         
	Tata Swach produces safe water without using power or running water. It has a cartridge bulb that kills bacteria and can purify up to 3,000 litres of water  or nearly a years consumption for a family of five  after which the cartridge stops water flow.         
	The group has filed for 14 patents for this technology and product.         
	The endeavour was to make a product as simple as a light bulb that reaches homes that do not have water or electricity and can mimic nature as closely as possible, said Tata Sons executive director R. Gopalakrishnan.         
	Tata Chemicals managing director R. Mukandan said the company had already produced a million units and would ramp up to 3 million purifiers annually in the next five years.         
	The purifiers will be made from a Tata Chemicals plant in Haldia at a cost of around Rs 100 crore. The company plans to eventually export Tata Swach to Africa.         
	According to a 2007 United Nations report, half of the worlds hospital beds are occupied by patients suffering from water-borne diseases. In India, such diseases cause more than 1.5 times the deaths caused by AIDS and double the deaths caused by road accidents, said a release by the group.

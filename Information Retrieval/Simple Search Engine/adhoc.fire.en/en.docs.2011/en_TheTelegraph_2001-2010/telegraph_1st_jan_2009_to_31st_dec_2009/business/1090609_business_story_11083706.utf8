The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Tata Steel gets a rating rap
                                                                                                               Tata Steel gets a rating rap
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Mumbai, June 8: Moodys Investors Service today downgraded Tata Steel to Ba3 from Ba2.         
	According to the global rating agency, the downgrade reflects the anticipated weakening of its consolidated financial profile in the intermediate term because of the weakness in steel markets apart from operating challenges faced by its European operations.        
	Moodys also downgraded the rating of Tata Steels subsidiary Tata Steel UK by one notch to B2.        
	The downgrade comes more than a week after Tata Steels lenders agreed to ease the terms for the 3.7-billion acquisition-related debt of Tata Steel UK.        
	Ivan Palacios, a Moodys analyst, said Tata Steels Indian operations had historically enjoyed better margins because of their globally competitive cost position, backed by a significant degree of vertical integration.         
	However, the extent of the deterioration in operating performance is greater at the companys European operation  Tata Steel UK  because of its higher fixed-cost structure and its lack of captive raw materials.        
	Moodys points out that due to Tata Steel UKs expected material decline in profitability, it has had to negotiate the reset of the covenants under its 3.7-billion senior debt facility.

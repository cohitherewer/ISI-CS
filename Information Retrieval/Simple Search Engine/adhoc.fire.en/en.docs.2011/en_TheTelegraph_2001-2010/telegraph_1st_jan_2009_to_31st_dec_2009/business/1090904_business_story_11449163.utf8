	New Delhi, Sept. 3: German car manufacturer Audi will start assembling sports utility vehicle Q5 in India from March to avoid steep import taxes.        
	India is the second country after Germany where the Q5 will be assembled, said Benoit Tiers, managing director of Audi India, at the launch of a new version of the Q7 sports utility vehicle (SUV).        
	Fully built cars and SUVs attract an import tax of 116 per cent, which drops to 60 per cent if the vehicle is assembled locally.        
	We will start local assembling of the Q5 at the Aurangabad plant. We expect to sell 200 units of the car this year. It should go up to 500 units from next year, Tiers said.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Mitra: Big responsibility                                  
	New Delhi, Nov. 13: The Union government is drawing up plans to sell stakes in 60 state-run enterprises, including SAIL, BSNL and Coal India.         
	The finance ministry is already in talks with other government departments to identify some 10 PSUs where the government has equity of more than 90 per cent. The aim is to bring down the stake to 90 per cent or below as Sebi rules stipulate.         
	It will also try selling stakes in another 50 entities, which are profitable but unlisted. The stake sale is likely to be spread over a period of time and will take three years or more to materialise.        
	The listings would unlock shareholder value in the companies. We have begun inter-ministry talks to identify potential candidates for divestment. The divestment would be considered on a case-to-case basis, divestment secretary Sunil Mitra said.        
	Earlier this year, the government listed NHPC and Oil India on the bourses. Within this financial year, it plans to push through stake sales in NTPC Ltd, Rural Electrification Corporation Limited and Satluj Jal Vidyut Nigam Limited (an unlisted company).        
	The government may earn Rs 8,100 crore from the sale of 5 per cent stake in listed NTPC, the secretary said. On November 5, the government allowed funds earned from divestment to be directly shovelled into social sector projects instead of being locked in the National Investment Fund.        
	The government had also made it mandatory for all state-run firms that had earned a profit in the last three years to list on the bourses.        
	Besides, it asked listed profitable ones to place at least 10 per cent of their shares with the public. We are talking to a number of administrative ministries regarding these 60 companies. But it does not mean we are close to divesting them... All this is a function of a number of factors, the secretary said.        
	Mitra said he was in talks with the ministries of steel, coal and telecom to explore the possibility of stake sales in SAIL, Coal India and BSNL, respectively.        
	The budget had forecast a 16-year-high fiscal deficit at over Rs 4 lakh crore, or 6.8 per cent of GDP. Divestments will help to bridge the deficit.

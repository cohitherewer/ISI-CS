          OUR BUREAU                          Air pocket                                  
	Mumbai, Oct. 28: The dog days for Indias airline industry continue.         
	Just a day after Jet Airways announced a Rs 407-crore second-quarter loss, Vijay Mallya-owned Kingfisher Airlines reported a pre-tax loss of Rs 651.64 crore in the quarter ended September 30, which was 9.6 per cent lower than the Rs 720.97 crore in the year-ago quarter. However, Kingfisher  ranked as the biggest airline in the country in terms of market share  took advantage of a few accounting devices to pare its post-tax loss to Rs 418.77 crore.         
	The airline is taking advantage of a deferred tax asset of Rs 232.77 crore. The company believes it is well within its rights to use this accounting device.

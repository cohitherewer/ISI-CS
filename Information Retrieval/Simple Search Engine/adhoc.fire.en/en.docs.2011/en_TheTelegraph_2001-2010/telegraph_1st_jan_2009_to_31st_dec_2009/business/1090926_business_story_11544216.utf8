The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | NTPC seeks clarity on gas price 
                                                                                                               NTPC seeks clarity on gas price 
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Sept. 25: State-run NTPC Ltd has raised the issue of the marketing margin it would have to pay on gas from Reliance Industries Krishna-Godavari (KG) basin.        
	The PSU has asked the power ministry to seek confirmation from the oil ministry or the empowered group of ministers on the payment of the margin.        
	On Wednesday, NTPC wrote to the power ministry that its board, while approving the signing of the gas sale and purchase agreement (GSPA) with RIL, had decided to take up the matter of marketing margin with the appropriate government authority.        
	NTPC this week signed an agreement to buy 0.61 million metric standard cubic meters per day (mmscmd) of gas from RILs KG-D6 fields at a price of $4.20 per million British thermal unit (mBtu) plus $0.135 per mBtu marketing margin. It said it had sought legal opinion on the oil ministrys advice that the marketing margin was purely a commercial issue between the seller and the buyer.         
	The legal opinion stated that this issue is a commercial issue and NTPC would need to look at it accordingly... NTPC should take up the issue of marketing margin separately through the ministry of power with the appropriate authority in the government.         
	NTPC said that Reliance had informed it that the company was charging a uniform margin from all buyers.

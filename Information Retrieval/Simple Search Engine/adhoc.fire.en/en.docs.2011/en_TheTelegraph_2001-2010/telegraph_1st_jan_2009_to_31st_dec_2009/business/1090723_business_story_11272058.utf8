The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Oil hunt drill to start afresh on August 8
                                                                                                               Oil hunt drill to start afresh on August 8
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Countdown begins                                  
	New Delhi, July 22: The eighth round of the New Exploration Licensing Policy (Nelp) will be relaunched on August 8, and the bidding will end by mid-October, a petroleum ministry official said.        
	Officials said roadshows would be held in the US, Europe and Australia to attract global companies to bid for the 70 blocks on offer.        
	On April 9, the government had launched the eighth round of auction under Nelp, with August 10 set as the last date for bidding.         
	However, the auction was deferred because of ambiguity over a tax holiday for natural gas.        
	Officials said the eighth round of auctions was being relaunched after finance minister Pranab Mukherjee stated in his budget for 2009-10 that the seven-year income-tax holiday on profits from producing and selling natural gas would be available for blocks awarded under Nelp-VIII.        
	Analysts said the discovery of gas in the KG basin had raised expectations that the country had more gas blocks than oil.        
	The petroleum ministry hopes that global names such as Royal Dutch Shell, Exxon Mobil and ConocoPhillips will be keen to take part in the auctions after the restoration of the tax holiday.         
	In Nelp-VII, BHP Billiton and British Petroleum participated in the bidding and are expected to study geological data this time, too.        
	Domestic companies ONGC, Oil India and Reliance are likely to bid in Nelp-VIII.        
	India is offering 24 deep-sea blocks, 28 shallow water blocks and 18 onland blocks for bidding and hopes to attract $3-billion investment in exploration.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Andhra bid to dump Maytas
                                                                                                               Andhra bid to dump Maytas
          G. S. RADHAKRISHNA                      Rosaiah: Strict stance                          
	Hyderabad, Feb. 18: The Andhra government has initiated the process to dump scam-scarred Maytas Infra from two prestigious projects  the Rs 12,000-crore Hyderabad metro rail project and the Rs 4,500-crore programme to modernise the Machilipatnam port.        
	Maytas Infra is owned by the family of Satyam founder B. Ramalinga Raju who is at the centre of Indias biggest corporate fraud.        
	Andhra finance minister K. Rosaiah held a meeting with top bureaucrats here today and started the process to scrap the two contracts awarded to Maytas Infra.        
	The move followed the Centres sudden decision yesterday to approach the Company Law Board (CLB) for permission to sack the Maytas Infra board of directors and appoint government directors in their place.        
	Maytas Infra has also won contracts from the Andhra government for several road and irrigation projects but these are not immediately under threat.        
	Rosaiah played coy when he told reporters after the meeting that the state was not looking to act in haste while deciding on the Maytas contracts. However, government sources admitted that Maytas stood to lose the metro rail and the port project contracts.        
	Officials are now deliberating over how to dump Maytas Infra and ensure the continuity of the projects and minimise delays. The state government will almost certainly encash the bank guarantees worth Rs 3,000 crore that Maytas had furnished.        
	All our efforts over the past few months to save the two projects have now come to nought, said one worried official. We wanted to ensure that Maytas remained legally committed to them so that the state government wouldnt have to shoulder any financial burden.        
	In the second week of February, Maytas Infra had written to the state government seeking a 30-day extension of the deadline for the financial closure of the Hyderabad metro rail project. Maytas also had to make a payment of Rs 118 crore.        
	Meanwhile, Karnataka has initiated legal action to terminate its contract with Maytas Infra, which leads a consortium that is building airports at Shimoga and Gulbarga, two small towns in the state, Vishwanath Hegde Kageri, Karnataka minister for primary education, said on Wednesday.

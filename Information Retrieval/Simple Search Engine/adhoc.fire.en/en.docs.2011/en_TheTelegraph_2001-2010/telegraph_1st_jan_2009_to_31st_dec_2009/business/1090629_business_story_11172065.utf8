The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Deficit warning from S amp;P
                                                                                                               Deficit warning from S amp;P
                            
	New Delhi, June 28 (PTI): The governments fiscal deficit may increase 1 per cent over the projections made in the interim budget to 6.5 per cent of the GDP because of possible stimulus measures in the full budget to be presented next month, Standard amp; Poors said.        
	There is a possibility that Indias fiscal deficits will increase by 1 percentage point of the GDP from the level expected by the interim budget, S amp;Ps sovereign rating director T.K. Ogawa said. He attributed this to finance minister Pranab Mukherjees statement in the interim budget that the next government might take further stimulus measures, which could be 0.5-1 per cent of the size of the GDP.        
	In February, S amp;P warned that Indias ratings could be downgraded to junk grade if its fiscal deficit widened significantly.

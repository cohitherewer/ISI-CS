	New Delhi, July 11: Finance minister Pranab Mukherjee today allayed fears that high government borrowing from the market, estimated at over Rs 4 lakh crore for the current fiscal, would leave little resource with the private sector.         
	On further cuts in interest rates, Mukherjee said the RBI would act appropriately as and when needed.        
	We will ensure that market borrowing does not crowd out private investment, Mukherjee told reporters after a post-budget meeting with the RBI board here.        
	Mukherjee added that increased public spending was necessary to put the economy back to a high growth trajectory as private expenditure wouldnt be able to meet the full requirement.        
	The government, in its budget estimates, had announced that it would borrow an additional Rs 89,000 crore from the market to fund a fiscal deficit projected at 6.8 per cent of GDP for fiscal 2010. This will increase the total government borrowing for the year to Rs 4,51,000 crore, substantially higher than Rs 3,62,000 crore planned earlier this year.        
	Corporate India has been apprehensive that higher government borrowing will affect private investment as banks will be left with little money to lend to corporate houses after buying government bonds. Also, it will put pressure on interest rates.        
	Mukherjee said there was no conflict between the fiscal moves of the government and the easy monetary policy of the RBI.         
	There is no inherent conflict between the monetary policy and the fiscal policy. We are working in close cooperation as we had done it in the worst period of the present crisis, he said.        
	The government, on its part, has announced three stimulus packages involving tax cuts and subsidies for various sectors such as exports.        
	Since the global financial crisis came to the fore in September last year, the Reserve Bank has lowered its key lending rate by 4.25 percentage points to 4.75 per cent and the reverse repurchase rate, or its short-term borrowing rate, by 2.75 percentage points to 3.25 per cent.        
	As and when the situation will require, appropriate action will be taken (by the RBI) but what appropriate action and at what point of time is not predictable, said Mukherjee when asked whether the central bank can further lower interest rates.        
	Analysts expect the RBI to hold rates steady when it meets on July 28 to discuss the monetary policy.        
	We judge that the rate-cutting cycle is over and that the RBIs biggest challenge is managing the governments large market borrowing programme, said Sonal Varma, economist at Mumbai-based Nomura Securities.         
	After the pre-policy meeting with the RBI governor, SBI chairman .P. Bhatt had said interest rates could rise in the next six months on the possibility of robust credit growth in October-March.

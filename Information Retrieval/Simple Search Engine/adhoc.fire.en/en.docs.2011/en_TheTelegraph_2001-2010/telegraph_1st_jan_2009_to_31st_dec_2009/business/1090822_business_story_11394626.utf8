The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Ambani junior takes up cudgels for NTPC
                                                                                                               Ambani junior takes up cudgels for NTPC
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Mumbai, Aug. 21: The Anil Ambani side has said the petroleum ministry must supply 12 million cubic metres of gas a day to NTPC at $2.34 per mBtu for 17 years if it is sincere in its promise to protect the power utilitys interests.        
	The price at which NTPC receives the gas will serve as a benchmark for Anil Ambani-owned RNRL under the terms of the memorandum of understanding (MoU) that served as a basis for the eventual carve-up of the Reliance empire in February 2006.        
	Reacting to the governments statement on the gas pricing issue, the Reliance ADA group denied accusations of spreading misinformation to the public through its ad campaign.        
	The group also issued a rebuttal of sorts to the governments statement on the revenues it will earn from the KG gasfields.        
	The estimates by the petroleum ministry for government revenues appear to be erroneous and apparently include royalty and corporate taxes, Reliance Power chief executive J.P. Chalasani said.        
	This incorrectly inflates the amount of government share of profit petroleum as defined in the production sharing contract, the statement said.        
	Under the terms of the deal, the government will receive a share in the profits only after the full costs of exploration are recovered by RIL.        
	The statement added that the government was initially entitled to only a 10 per cent share of profit petroleum, which, in turn, amounted to only 10 per cent of the total revenues since 90 per cent of the initial revenues will go towards cost recovery.         
	Therefore, the government will get only 1 per cent or Rs 500 crore, while RIL gets Rs 49,500 crore, the statement said.                     
	This 99 per cent to 1 per cent split of revenues has been reconfirmed by RILs own letter dated July 20, 2009 to the petroleum ministry regarding payments made on account of profit petroleum for first quarter 2009-10, it added.        
	The Anil Ambani camp once again accused the petroleum ministry of taking up the task of defending RILs gold-plated capital expenditure instead of seeking clarification from RIL in national interest.        
	It is unfortunate that the petroleum ministry has also not provided any response in respect of the large number of issues pointed out which clearly demonstrate its bias and partisan approach of favouring RIL and enabling it to wriggle out of binding contractual commitments with NTPC and RNRL, the statement added.

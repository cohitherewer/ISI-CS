                                                                                                               Land hurdle to Nissan-Leyland plan
          GARIMA SINGH NEOGY                          Time factor                                  
	New Delhi, Feb. 6: The Nissan-Ashok Leyland joint venture in light commercial vehicles is likely to be delayed by more than six months because of land acquisition hurdles.        
	Issues related to land acquisition still need to be sorted out. We have not heard anything on this issue, there is no outcome yet, R. Seshasayee, managing director, Ashok Leyland, told The Telegraph.        
	At the India Economic Summit held in November last year, Seshasayee had expressed hope that the problem would be resolved by January.         
	The joint venture has signed a memorandum of understanding with the Tamil Nadu government to acquire 380 acres at Pillaipakkam, 40 kilometres from Chennai.        
	According to sources, production may get delayed beyond mid-2011.         
	In May last year, Ashok Leyland Nissan Vehicles Pvt Ltd had announced the formation of three companies for light commercial vehicles weighing 6-9 tonnes, powertrains and technology development.        
	Production was scheduled to start by 2010-11.         
	The company will initially produce 1 lakh vehicles per annum, but capacity will be scaled up. Nissan expects to initially export around 20 per cent of production. Leyland will hold a 51 per cent stake in the Rs 2,760-crore venture.        
	On Ashok Leylands plan to resume normal production at all its plants by the middle of this year, Seshasayee said, We are ready to do that, but it all depends on the market situation and the economics of demand and supply.        
	The company has been operating three days a week across all its facilities because of a slowdown in demand. Seshasayee said the current production schedule would continue for now.         
	Firms such as Hyundai Motors India and Tata Motors hope to resume normal production by the second half of this year.

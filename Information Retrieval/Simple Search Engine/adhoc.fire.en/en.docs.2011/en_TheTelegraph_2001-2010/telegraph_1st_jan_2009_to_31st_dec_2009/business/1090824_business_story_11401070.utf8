        Policyholders stand to gain little from the changes brought about in Ulip charges, says Srikumar Bondyopadhyay                                            
	Succumbing to pressure from insurers, the insurance regulator has kept mortality and morbidity charges  money that an insurer deducts for providing risk cover to the policyholder against death and disability  out of the cap on fees it had introduced a month back on Ulips.         
	The regulator has also increased the maximum limit for fund management fees to 1.35 per cent from 1.25 per cent in case of policies of more than 10 years, while it has been cut to 1.35 per cent from 1.50 per cent for policies of less than 10 years.        
	Insurers are happy at this move. But what about prospective policy buyers? Are they going to gain or lose after this change (vis--vis the July order)?         
	Before we go into a detailed discussion, let us first list the charges that are excluded from the cap.         
	Whats out?        
	The first circular dated July 22, 2009 noted that the limit on charges would not be applicable to premium charged for extraordinary health conditions, cost of all rider benefits, service tax on charges and any explicit cost of investment guarantee. The modified circular on August 20 states that mortality and morbidity charges may also be excluded in addition to the charges mentioned above.         
	Since service tax and mortality charges are now out of the 3 per cent (2.25 per cent for policies of more than 10 years) cap, total charges to be paid by a policyholder will be upwards of 4 per cent.         
	The cost will be more if you buy a rider with the basic plan as the premium paid for riders are not included in the limit on Ulip charges.        
	Whats in?        
	What are the charges that will be included? These are the premium allocation charges (the difference between the premium paid and the portion of the premium actually invested), the policy administration charge (a flat fee that is deducted every month to maintain the policy document) and the fund management fee.        
	With the maximum limit on fund management fee being capped at 1.35 per cent, the overall limit on premium allocation charge (a large part of which goes towards agency commission) and policy administration charge will be 1.65 per cent for policies up to 10 years and 0.9 per cent for policies above 10 years.         
	Following the modified order of the insurance regulator on Ulip charges, most insurers now wont need to modify their existing plans. After the July order it was estimated that insurers would have to modify at least 90 per cent of their unit-linked plans available in the market.        
	Insignificant gain        
	As for policyholders, the gain in return from the investment will be insignificant after the increase in fund management fees and exclusion of mortality and morbidity charges from calculation of the expense ratio.        
	Let us explain this with the help of an existing Ulip of a leading private sector insurer. This plan is chosen because the death benefit in this plan is the aggregate of sum assured plus the accumulated fund value, unlike other Ulips which give the higher of sum assured or accumulated fund value.        
	In our example, the age of the policyholder is 30 years and he pays an annual premium of Rs 50,000 for a sum assured of Rs 2.5 lakh for a period of 20 years.         
	The premium allocation charge (the percentage of premium deducted before allocating to investment fund) is 15 per cent in the first year, 10 per cent in the second and third year and 5 per cent thereafter.        
	At an annual compounded return of 10 per cent, the maturity value of the unit-linked plan at the end of 20 years is Rs 23,39,995 after providing for all charges (read, net yield as referred to by the insurance regulator).         
	Now, had there been no deduction of charges, the policyholders annual premium of Rs 50,000 would have amounted to Rs 31,50,125 (gross yield) in 20 years.         
	The total amount the policyholder thus pays towards various charges under the plan is Rs 8,10,130 (Rs 31,50,125 Rs 23,39,995).         
	According to the July order of the insurance regulator, the policyholder should get at least Rs 23,98,204 on maturity. In other words, the maximum permissible expense under the plan would be Rs 7,51,921 (Rs 31,50,125Rs 23,98,204), and not Rs 8,10,130.         
	This would have translated into a net gain of Rs 58,209 to the policyholder.         
	Now that the mortality charge (Rs 14,260) and the service tax (Rs 29,810) to be paid by the policyholder will be kept outside while calculating the net yield, the gain to the policyholder after Irdas promulgation of Ulip charges would be insignificant  only Rs 14,139!         
	The effect of new limits on the fund management fees wont be much in this case because its a dynamic plan that entails both equity and debt investments  equity investment is higher during first half of the policy term, while that in debt increases as the policy approaches maturity.         
	The total fund management charge under this plan is at present Rs 1,93,303, which is only 25.7 per cent of the maximum permissible expense limit.        
	While insurers wont have to modify their current charges under various unit-linked plans after the modified order of the regulator, a prospective policyholder wont gain much from the regulatory change. Policy buyers should be careful about mortality charges of different insurers as well as for different unit-linked plans for the same insurer.         
	Three weeks ago we noted in the same column how insurers differ from one another when it comes to mortality charges. Individual insurers also have varied mortality experience across different unit-linked plans. As a policy buyer, you should choose the insurer or the unit-linked plan that has the lowest mortality charges.

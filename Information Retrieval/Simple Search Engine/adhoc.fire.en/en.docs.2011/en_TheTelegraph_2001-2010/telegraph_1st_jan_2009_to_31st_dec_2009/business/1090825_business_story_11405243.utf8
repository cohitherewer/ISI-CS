	Calcutta, Aug. 24: Aluminium extrusion maker Century Extrusions Ltd plans to set up a plant in Kharagpur to make value-added products.        
	The company is in the process of buying land for the factory, which can involve an investment of Rs 20 crore.        
	Chairman and managing director M.P. Jhunjhunwala said the company wanted to manufacture products used by construction, power and auto companies.        
	We want to make anodizing and powder coating facilities, door and window systems manufacturing units, and a plant for making components for solar panel, auto and engineering industries, he said.        
	Century Extrusions has doubled its capacity to 15,000 tonnes at an investment of Rs 40 crore.

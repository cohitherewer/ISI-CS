The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Refund riddle
                                                                                                                 Q amp;A      Refund riddle
                                I opened a Senior Citizen Savings Scheme account with GPO, Calcutta and the same matured in August this year. The scheme stated that there would be no TDS. But subsequently tax was deducted at source since 2006-07. I am submitting Form 15H since then. When I applied for refund of the TDS, the GPO insisted on furnishing the copies of income-tax return. I am 67-years-old and my income is much less than the basic exemption limit. What should I do now?          Dipika Dey, Calcutta
                    The GPO cannot deduct tax on your interest income at source if you had submitted Form 15 H on time, that is, before April 1, 2006. Otherwise, it was right in doing so. If you have not submitted Form 15 H in time every year, you would have to file income tax return to claim the refund of the TDS. Filing of tax return is mandatory if you have taxable income or if you claim tax refund.                                  Deduction options      I am a pensioner. I come under the income-tax bracket. What are the tax-saving instruments? I pay nearly Rs 10,000 as life insurance premium for my daughter. Will this be eligible for claiming deduction? I pay every year Rs 15,000-20,000 to my daughter as gift. She has a spinal chord problem and is confined at home. Can I claim exemption on this gift?        G.C. Chakraborty, Dum Dum Park
                    You can claim a maximum deduction of Rs 1 lakh under Section 80C on investment in any one or more of these instruments  NSC, tax-saving schemes of MFs, tax-saving FDs with scheduled commercial banks, SCSS and life insurance premium. You can claim deduction of up to Rs 1 lakh under Section 80DD if you have a dependent with serious disability. For this, you need to get a disability certificate.                      Wealth tax      Do I have to pay wealth tax every year? May I get any relief as a senior citizen?        Avijit Paul, Calcutta
                    The threshold for wealth tax has been increased to Rs 30 lakh from financial year 2009-10. It is calculated on the basis of net wealth of the assessee and the tax has to be paid every year. There is no special relief for senior citizens.

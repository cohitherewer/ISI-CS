          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                            
	New Delhi, Dec. 30: The government has allowed Diageo  the worlds biggest liquorcompany  to buy out Radico Khaitans stake in a joint venture.         
	It has also cleared Japan-based Mitsuis plan to set up warehousing and container freight stations in the country.        
	The Foreign Investment Promotion Board (FIPB) has cleared nine proposals that will bring in investments worth Rs 524 crore, more than half of which would be by Mitsui.        
	The Netherlands-based Diageo Highlands, which owns Diageo India, had proposed to raise its stake to 100 per cent in Diageo Radico Distilleries from 50 per cent.         
	However, the proposal is subject to conditions imposed by a government press note issued in 2005, according to which any foreign company operating in the country through a joint venture has to seek a no-objection certificate from its Indian partner before investing in other firms in the same segment.        
	New Delhi-based Radico Khaitan is among the largest manufacturers of IMFL (Indian Made Foreign Liquor) with its range of whisky, brandy, rum and vodka spanning the entire segment.         
	It has over 23 brands that are bottled and marketed through six of its own facilities and 41 tie-ups across the country        
	In the joint venture, Diageo manages sales and marketing of Masterstroke Whisky, a semi-premium whisky, which competes with heavyweights such as United Spirits Ltds McDowell No. 1 and Pernod Ricards Royal Stag whiskies.        
	The FIPB also cleared Mitsuis proposal to invest Rs 326 crore to set up a wholly owned subsidiary in warehousing and a joint venture company in the container freight station segment.        
	However, a proposal by US-based Telecordia Technologies for mobile number portability was deferred following concerns raised by the home ministry.         
	Mobile number portability enables customers to retain their number while switching to another service provider.        
	Six other proposals to be deferred include US-based Verizon Communications plans for transferring equity shares.        
	Five proposals, including that of Bangladesh-based Southern Automobiles Limited, were rejected.

                                                                                                                 Q amp;A      Share concern
                                I have got share certificates of different companies in physical form. Will you let me know how to change these in demat form?          P. Sinha, Calcutta
                Almost all banks now offer demat services. You can approach your bank for opening a demat account. The demat account should be opened in the same sequence of names as it appears on your physical shares. Then give the physical shares to your bank and ask it to convert them into a demat form. They will charge some fees for this.                                  Refund claim      I am 72-years-old and have a pension income. For accounting year 2006-07, I did not submit any income tax return as my total income during the corresponding financial year was below the threshold limit. My bank deducted Rs 488 tax at source on the ground that I had not submitted Form 15H. Instead of submitting Form 15H in April every year, I submit the same in the year of maturity. The bank has, however, given me a certificate of tax deduction. Can I get the refund of the tax deducted at source? I have a PAN.        Debabrata Roy, Santoshpur
                      One can submit the annual income return till March 31 of the next assessment year, that is till March 31, 2008, if one doesnt have any tax liability. Annual return can be filed after that but with a penalty at the discretion of the assessment officer. Form 15H should be submitted in the first week of April every year. Otherwise, banks will deduct tax at source. However, you can mention the tax amount deducted by the bank at source in your annual income return and claim refund for the same.                                      Insurance at will      We have an income tax file in the name of an HUF. I want to take a life insurance policy for my grandson and pay the premium out of my HUF fund. Will there be any deduction on payment of premium under Section 80C?        Sawar Mal Gupta, Calcutta
                      In the case of an HUF, a life insurance policy can be taken for any member of the family and the premium paid from the HUF fund attracts deduction under Section 80C.

                                                                                                               L amp;T flush with new orders
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                             
	Mumbai, April 16: Engineering major Larsen amp; Toubro Limited is expecting a 25-35 per cent increase in orders in this fiscal, indicating better days for the capital goods industry.        
	In the last fiscal, new orders of the company rose 24 per cent to Rs 52,000 crore from Rs 42,000 crore a year ago.         
	Orders came from oil amp; gas and infrastructure companies  L amp;Ts traditional clients  as well as from power companies and the railways.        
	L amp;T said it had been investing in the creation of capacities and capabilities in areas which have good long-term prospects, such as power and railways.        
	In 2008-09, capital goods coped with project deferments and cancellations in the wake of the economic downturn. Some customers had sought a revision in the contracted price.        
	However, in February, the sector expanded 10.4 per cent, while overall industry growth was down 1.2 per cent.        
	Among analysts, the mood is one of caution. The current trends do not indicate that the sector is out of the woods.         
	The current scenario for the Indian capital goods industry is undoubtedly plagued with uncertainty given the various headwinds being faced by it, Angel Broking said in a recent note.         
	The brokerage said it expected cuts in capital expenditure by private firms in the wake of the liquidity crunch and a weak demand.         
	There is going to be continued downward pressure on the new order intake for the sector coupled with slowing execution speed, Angel Broking said.

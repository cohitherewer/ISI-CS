          PIYA SINGH                          Way forward: A traffic sign outside the Satyam office in Bangalore on Wednesday. (AP)                                  
	Mumbai, Jan. 7: The long line of suitors hoping to buy the countrys fourth largest software company, Satyam Computer Services, has disappeared overnight.        
	As Satyam acquired the status of an untouchable asset following confessions of huge accounting frauds by promoter Ramalinga Raju, potential investors, existing shareholders and regulators were grappling with scenarios to predict how the events would unfold.        
	While there have been declarations of a series of investigations by the Centre and states, Sebi and the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India, investment bankers said the first step would be a forensic audit. This fresh audit should give a true picture of the balance sheet.         
	It is not yet clear who will conduct this forensic audit but a decision is likely when the board meets on January 10.        
	Not only has the book value of the company become irrelevant as there is hardly any cash in the company compared with earlier estimates of $1.2 billion, but also the scale of the assets and the number of debtors are unknown.        
	CLSA has even questioned whether Satyam has 50,000 employees, while others such as the US-based Susquehanna Financial group have suspended their financial rating on the group. Morgan Stanley said the actual earnings per share might be 70 to 80 per cent lower than reported.         
	So, while it is reasonably clear that potential suitors such as the Anil Ambani group, Tech Mahindra, Cognizant, HCL and private equity firms such as Caryle will not proceed till there is some clarity on the numbers, financial institutions such as Aberdeen, among several others, have already exited from the stock. The Life Insurance Corporation is, however, still invested in Satyam.         
	LIC executive director (investment-operations) N. Mohan Raj said LIC had not been in talks with other financial institutions or buyers.        
	In a related development, Merrill Lynch, which was appointed to consider merger options, has terminated its advisory engagement with Satyam as there were material accounting irregularities.                                      
	 quot;We have not spoken to anybody including potential buyers and neither can we do anything by ourselves. Let some offer come first under which the employees and future shareholders will flourish and we will support such a well meaning initiative quot; said Mohan Raj.

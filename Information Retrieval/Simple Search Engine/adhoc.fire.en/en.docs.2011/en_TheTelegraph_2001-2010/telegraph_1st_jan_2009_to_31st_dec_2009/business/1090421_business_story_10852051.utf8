                                                                                                               RBI fears slackening of growth pace
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT      
	Mumbai, April 20: The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) today set a sombre mood ahead of its credit policy announcement by quoting a survey of professional forecasters that lowered estimates of Indias economic growth for 2009-10 to 5.7 per cent from 6 per cent earlier.        
	In its report titled Macroeconomic and Monetary Developments in 2008-09  a document that serves as a backdrop to the annual policy statement to be released on Tuesday  the central bank said an assessment of the economic conditions at the current juncture indicated that global economic conditions had deteriorated sharply during 2008 and the forecasts of the various international agencies pointed to a deepening of recessionary conditions during 2009.                  
	Reflecting global developments and their impact on the Indian economy, as well as domestic cyclical factors, the various surveys of economic activity point towards prevalence of less than optimistic sentiment for the outlook of the Indian economy in the coming months, it said.        
	A survey of professional forecasters conducted by the central bank in March showed moderation in economic activity for 2008-09.        
	The RBI had earlier forecast that the Indian economy would grow at 7.1 per cent. It could moderate that forecast tomorrow.         
	According to the RBI, between the sixth round of survey conducted in December 2008 and the seventh round in March this year, the median forecast of real GDP growth for 2008-09 was revised downwards to 6.6 per cent from 6.8 per cent.        
	While the sectoral growth forecast for the agriculture sector was revised downwards from 3 per cent to 1.6 per cent and for industry from 4.9 per cent to 4.1 per cent, the sectoral growth rate for services was revised upwards to 9.3 per cent from 9 per cent.        
	Significantly, the survey found out that the median forecast of real GDP growth for 2009-10 came down to 5.7 per cent from 6 per cent.        
	According to the RBI, optimism for the April-June 2009 quarter on major business sentiment indicators such as overall business situation, overall financial situation, production, order books, capacity utilisation, exports and profit margin declined compared with a year ago.         
	However, for the quarter, the overall net sentiment for all industries except textiles is positive.        
	Bankers are split on the possibility of another rate cut  which will be the sixth in less than a year should it happen. The aggressive rate cuts, which began in October last year, have seen lending rates decline to single digit levels.        
	In its report, the RBI said inflation, as measured by year-on-year variations in the wholesale price index (WPI), had fallen sharply to 0.26 per cent as at end-March 2009 and further to 0.18 per cent as on April 4.        
	However, inflation measured against the consumer price indices remains high with recent evidence of very modest moderation        
	Various measures of consumer price inflation, though started declining, still remained high in the range of 9.6 to 10.8 per cent during January/February 2009 as compared with 5.2 to 6.4 per cent in February 2008, it said.

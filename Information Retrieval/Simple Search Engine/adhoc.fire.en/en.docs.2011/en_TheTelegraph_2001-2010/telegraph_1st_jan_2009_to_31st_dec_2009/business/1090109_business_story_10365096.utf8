          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Satyam interim CEO Ram Mynampati (third from left) with other officials in Hyderabad on Thursday. (PTI)                                         
	Mumbai, Jan. 8: The new leadership team of beleaguered Satyam Computer Services will keep PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) onboard as they attempt to understand the processes used by the auditor to verify accounts.        
	Speaking to the media on Thursday, interim CEO Ram Mynampati said, We have not yet verified what processes PricewaterhouseCoopers took to certify the financial statements of the company.         
	While Mynampati indicated that they had not had a dialogue with PwC yet, it seemed that the interim CEO, who is also on the board of the company, went by the audited numbers of Satyam.         
	PwC, on its part, did not defend its position outright. The audit firm said, Over the last two days, there have been media reports on the alleged irregularities in the accounts of Satyam Computer. Pricewaterhouse Coopers is the statutory auditor of Satyam. The audits were conducted in accordance with auditing standards and were supported by appropriate evidence.        
	It further stated, Given our obligations for client confidentiality, it is not possible for us to comment upon the alleged irregularities. PwC will fully meet its obligations to co-operate with the regulators and others.        
	As the role of the auditor assumes centre stage in this unfolding drama, it is still unclear whether a fresh team will be brought in to conduct a forensic audit. For the time being PwC will continue as the auditor of Satyam.         
	Mynampati said a group of chartered accountants in Satyam had started assessing the accounts of the company, including verifying items such as receivables on the balance sheet.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Tatas cash in on TCS stake   UK arm exits software company
                                                                                                               Tatas cash in on TCS stake   UK arm exits software company
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT        
	Mumbai, May 6: Tata Ltd, a UK-based subsidiary of Tata Sons, has sold a 1.05 per cent stake in software company Tata Consultancy Services for Rs 634.80 crore.         
	In a single transaction on the National Stock Exchange on Wednesday, Tata Ltd  one of the companies within the Tata group that holds shares in TCS  exited fully from the software firm by selling 10.3 million shares at a price of Rs 615.04 a share. Market sources said Citigroup was the bookrunner for the deal.         
	The TCS stock fell 2.36 per cent today when it closed at Rs 635.10 on the Bombay Stock Exchange.        
	Sources said the share sale might have been prompted by the Tata groups requirement for funds on account of the Jaguar-Land Rover acquisition.         
	Tata Motors, which bought JLR last year for $2.3 billion, has been looking at ways to refinance the debt worth $2 billion it had taken to seal the deal.        
	Wednesdays transaction brings down the Tata group companies stake in TCS  the countrys largest software exporter  to around 75 per cent. Tata Sons alone holds 73.75 per cent in TCS.        
	Tata Sons  the apex holding company of the Tata group  held a 90 per cent stake in TCS before the company went in for an initial public offer in 2004.         
	Tata Sons has also pledged 16.72 per cent of its 73.75 per cent stake in TCS in the quarter ended March 2009, according to data available on the Bombay Stock Exchange.        
	While the Tata group spokesperson declined to comment, market observers said the move was widely expected considering that the group was aggressively seeking funds especially in the short term.         
	A Tata Sons subsidiary selling a stake in TCS at this point when valuations are not exactly at their peak is a clear indication that the group has gone in for the tried and tested route of diluting their stake in TCS when they need cash, said an investment banker.        
	The Tata group has been looking to raise cash to meet the funding needs of the JLR acquisition.         
	It has considered an overseas bond issue of over $500 million in the last quarter. It also approached the UK government for financial support towards JLR.         
	Earlier this year, Tata Motors got some relief when the European Investment Bank agreed to support automobile companies, including JLR, to make cleaner cars with a loan of 366 million euros, or roughly Rs 2,500 crore.         
	The money was supposed to be used to fund plans to reduce emissions.

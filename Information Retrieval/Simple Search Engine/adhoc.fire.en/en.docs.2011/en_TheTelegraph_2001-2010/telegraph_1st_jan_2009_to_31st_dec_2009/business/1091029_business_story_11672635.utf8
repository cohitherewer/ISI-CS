The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | AI faces fresh turbulence
                                                                                                               AI faces fresh turbulence
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Mumbai, Oct. 28: National carrier Air India is heading into another turbulent phase with non-executive pilots threatening to go on strike if their dues arent cleared by November 1.        
	The pilots belong to the erstwhile Indian Airlines and are banded under the Indian Commercial Pilots Association (ICPA), the bargaining agent for non-executive pilots.        
	The ICPA has asked the NACIL (National Aviation Company of India) management to pay the two-month dues to these pilots in the next four days.        
	NACIL is the holding company of Air India and Indian Airlines formed after the merger of the two state-owned carriers.        
	R.S. Otal, general secretary of the ICPA, told The Telegraph that the company had not paid non-executive pilots their allowances for the months of August and September. These allowances, he said, constitute around 70 per cent of the average pilots wage of about Rs 3 lakh a month.        
	We have written to the management asking it to pay our dues by November 1 failing which we are ready to resort to any action, he said.        
	Otal said the non-executive pilots would not back down from their stand and had no intention of holding further talks with the management.        
	We have no intention of holding any meeting. This is because their (the NACIL management) single point agenda is a salary cut, to which we do not agree, he said.         
	Otal said there were other ways to turn around the financially strapped company besides wage cuts.

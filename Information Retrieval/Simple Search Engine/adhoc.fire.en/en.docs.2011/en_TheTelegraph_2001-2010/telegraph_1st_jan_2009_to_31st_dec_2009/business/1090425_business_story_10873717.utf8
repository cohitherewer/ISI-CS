The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Air India gets acting chairman
                                                                                                               Air India gets acting chairman
                            
	New Delhi, April 24 (PTI): E. K. Bharatbhushan, a Kerala cadre IAS officer, will replace Raghu Menon as chairman and managing director of Air India. Menon was at the helm of the national carrier for a year.        
	Bharatbhushan, 55, will be the acting chairman until further orders when a permanent incumbent will be appointed, Air India sources said. An order to this effect was issued late in the evening today, they added.        
	Bharatbhushan will hold charge of the CMD of Air India even while continuing as the joint secretary in civil aviation ministry, sources said.        
	The decision on Menon came at the end of a long, high-level meeting today presided over by cabinet secretary K. M. Chandrasekhar.         
	Menon, who was on leave till the month end, was appointed for a term of three years or till superannuation, whichever was earlier, and could have continued till 2010.         
	The top-level change in Air India came at a time when the airline, along with other Indian carriers, was passing through a major turbulence that had adversely affected its bottom line.        
	With its losses estimated around Rs 2,000 crore, the national carrier is in the process of making its case before the government for additional equity infusion of Rs 1,231 crore and a soft loan of Rs 2,750 crore, primarily for the acquisition of 111 aircraft from Boeing and Airbus.        
	The process of the merger of Air India and the erstwhile Indian Airlines is yet to be consolidated.        
	This is also affecting its joining the Star Alliance, as the airline is yet to merge the separate coding of AI (erstwhile Air-India) and IC (former Indian Airlines) into one.

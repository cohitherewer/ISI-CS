                                                                                                               Reliance open to gas cost audit
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Aug. 17: Reliance Industries today said that it was ready for a scrutiny of the costs incurred in extracting gas from the Krishna-Godavari (KG) basin by any agency, including the Comptroller and Auditor General of India (CAG).        
	Sources said the company officials informed the petroleum ministry that it had nothing to hide and was open to scrutiny. The ministry today held a meeting with private operators developing oil and gasfields over the CAG auditing its books.        
	Anil Ambani-run Reliance Natural Resources Limited has alleged that RIL may have inflated the cost of developing KG gas to charge more from the end users.         
	Anil had demanded an independent and objective re-examination by public accountability bodies such as the CAG and the Central Vigilance Commission of the apparently exorbitant capital expenditure of Rs 45,000 crore... in order that such capex recovery is brought down to realistic levels. In 2004, RIL had estimated a capital expenditure of Rs 12,000 crore to produce 40 million cubic metres of gas per day. This was raised to Rs 45,000 crore in 2006 to produce 80 million cubic metres per day.        
	Anil and his brother Mukesh  the promoter of Reliance Industries  are fighting a legal battle over the control of gas from the KG basin. The Supreme Court will hear the case next month.

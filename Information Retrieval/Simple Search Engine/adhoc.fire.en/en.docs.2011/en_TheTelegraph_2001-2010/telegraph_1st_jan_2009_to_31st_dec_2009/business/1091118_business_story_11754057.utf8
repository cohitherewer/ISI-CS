          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                               
	Bhubaneswar, Nov. 17: The Orissa government today shut down 65 more mines as it intensified its drive against operators flouting rules.        
	Last week, the government had ordered the closure of 63 mines, taking the total number of barred entities to 128.        
	We have ordered the suspension of mining activities in 128 mines on charge of violation of laws under forest and environment clearance, non-renewal of mining permission and others, Orissa steel and mines secretary Ashok Dalwai said.         
	The state accounts for 13 per cent of the countrys mineral exports.        
	In October, we had asked all the mines companies across the state to produce statutory documents for verification. So far, 128 companies have failed to furnish these documents, said Dalwai.         
	The mines owners have violated environmental and pollution control rules and undertaken mining in unleased areas in gross disregard of government approved plans and rules to protect the forest land.        
	Besides, the miners have not maintained statutory documents, Dalwai said.         
	Of the 128 mines served the closure notice, around 50 are manganese and iron ore mines. The rest include limestone, feldspar and china clay mines.         
	Most of these mines are located in mineral-rich Keonjhar and Sundargarh districts, government officials said.        
	Dalwai said instructions had been issued to officials to strictly adhere to rules and procedures while allowing operations.

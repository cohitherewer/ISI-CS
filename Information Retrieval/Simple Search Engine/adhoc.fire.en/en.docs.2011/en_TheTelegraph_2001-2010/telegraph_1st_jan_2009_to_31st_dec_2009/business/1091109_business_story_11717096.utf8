          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Sharma: Looking ahead                                  
	New Delhi, Nov. 8: Global retailer Wal-Mart will soon open around 40 cash-and-carry stores.        
	I was informed by the Wal-Mart CEO that it is looking at opening more stores. He gave me a figure of 40 stores in the immediate future, commerce minister Anand Sharma said at the India Economic Summit here today.        
	Bharti Wal-Mart, the joint venture between Bharti Enterprises and Wal-Mart, opened its first store in Amritsar in May. The initial plan for start 10-15 outlets.        
	S. Robson Walton, chairman of Wal-Mart Stores, had met Prime Minister Manmohan Singh on his visit to India earlier this month and had reportedly sought easier foreign investment rules.        
	At the summit today, the Prime Minister Manmohan said, Our policy will be guided by the desire to make India even more attractive for foreign direct investment. We are particularly keen to rationalise and simplify procedures to create an investor-friendly environment.        
	Sharma said the government was not keen on reviewing sectoral caps on FDI but would take steps to simplify procedures.         
	While foreign investment is not allowed in multi-brand retail, a 51 per cent FDI is permitted in single-brand chains.         
	According to Sharma, foreign fund inflows into the country will exceed $18 billion in the current financial year.        
	The commerce minister said exports would turn positive from the fourth quarter of this fiscal as the contraction had been arrested. Exports fell 13.8 per cent in September for the twelfth month in a row to $13.60 billion against the year-ago period.        
	Sharma said the government would review the incentives given to exporters next month.        
	Much of the growth that has happened has been driven by stimulus. They (stimulus) will have to continue till growth becomes demand-driven in the global economy, he said.        
	Local partner move        
	The Mittals, who are Wal-Marts Indian partner, are taking a break from pursuing global acquisitions in telecom through Bharti Airtel.        
	The company is not actively looking for buyouts, and bankers have not come up with any proposal, chairman and CEO of Airtel Sunil Bharti Mittal said on the sidelines of the India Economic Summit. Mittal also ruled out any interest in Kuwait-based Zain Telecom.        
	The New Delhi-based operator, which plans to roll out 3G services by October 2010, needs to conserve cash for the auction. The base price for pan-India 3G spectrum is Rs 3,500 crore, and bids could go up to as high as Rs 5,000 crore.

          OUR BUREAU                      NEW MESSAGE                          
	Mumbai, Sept. 9: After Diet Pepsi or Coke, how about a spot of diet SMS?        
	NTT DoCoMo  the Japanese telecom giant that started offering GSM services in an alliance with Tata Teleservices  is looking to stir up a storm in the most lucrative value-added telecom service by offering to charge mobile users one paise per character in the text messages they send.        
	What this means is that a short response like ok to an invitation to a night out with the boys will cost you just 2 paise against Re 1 that most telecom operators charge.        
	Tata DoCoMo is looking to play the price warrior to ramp up its subscriber base in an industry that is notorious for its fickle customers and high levels of churn.         
	The diet SMS service will be an option available only on the Tata DoCoMo network, which might limit its appeal now. Diet SMS will require the customers to send the recipients number and message to a short code number. Customers can also use the standard SMS service.         
	If the diet SMS service catches on, other operators may be tempted to introduce it as well. Telecom rivals have refused to comment on the new Tata DoCoMo offering and will be waiting to see how it pans out.         
	Earlier, Tata DoCoMo launched a per second billing system for voice calls to benefit consumers who make short duration calls. Most operators charge calls by the minute which means a call of just 10 seconds gets charged by the minute. SMS has proved to be the killer app in global telecom markets.         
	Independent analyst Portio Research predicted last year that revenues from messaging would surge to $67 billion by 2012 as mobile users zap 3.7 trillion messages to each other.         
	At the end of July, GSM players in India had 326.14 million subscribers. In the first quarter ended June 30, the GSM players had combined revenues of Rs 14,540.94 crore with an average revenue per user of Rs 191.28.         
	Back in March, NTT DoCoMo had picked up a 26 per cent stake in Tata Teleservices for $2.7 billion. There have been reports that it plans to pick a 12 per cent stake in the groups listed entity  Tata Teleservices (Maharashtra) Ltd.

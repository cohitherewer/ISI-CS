The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Mercedes pins hope on new E-Class
                                                                                                               Mercedes pins hope on new E-Class
          GARIMA SINGH NEOGY                          Fast track                                  
	New Delhi, Aug. 30: German luxury car maker Mercedes-Benz is banking on the new E-Class to boost flagging sales.        
	Mercedes, expecting lower sales in 2009 compared with 2008, is set to introduce the new model in the country by the end of this year.        
	We will launch the E-Class very soon before the end of the calendar year. I can assure you it will be a fantastic value proposition for the customer, Wilfred Aulbur, managing director and chief executive officer of Mercedes-Benz India, told The Telegraph.        
	The new E-Class, which will be competing with the BMW 5-series and Audi A6, has been designed to reduce Mercedess manufacturing costs by 25 per cent.         
	However, according to dealer sources, the price is expected to remain similar to the current model. The car will be priced between Rs 40 lakh and Rs 45 lakh. At present, the company sells about 550 units of the E-Class per annum.        
	It will be equipped with a 3.5-litre, V6 direct injection petrol delivering 292 bhp and a 7G-Tronic automatic transmission with paddle shifters. It is also expected to sport daytime LED lights. The diesel variant of this model with a 320 CDi engine is also slated to arrive by the year-end.        
	Mercedes had last week launched a special edition of its C-Class sedan.        
	The new models come at a time when the German firm is expecting lower sales this year.         
	Last year, we sold 3,625 units in the Indian market, but this year we will be lagging. We are launching the advanced E-Class before the end of the year and we hope this, along with our C-Class models, will help us to register good growth from 2010, said Aulbur.        
	The company has sold 1,650 units between January and July this year. In India, the C and E-Classes from the Mercedes stable constitute 35-40 per cent of the sales.        
	Besides the challenge of introducing models and maintaining its growth rate, Mercedes-Benz India is striving hard to maintain its position in sales among the foreign car firms. Arch rival, and another German car major, BMW is racing ahead in the numbers game.        
	BMW may have sold fewer cars in July than Mercedes  261 against 297 units of the latter  but from January-July, it has sold 2,008 cars against Mercedess 1,712.         
	In 2008, Mercedes sold 3,625 units, while the sales of BMW stood at 2,908.         
	Though the July sales are not an indicator of the reversal of a trend, it still has come as a huge relief for Mercedes.        
	BMW is set to launch its two-seater convertible roadster Z4 in India in October this year.         
	The vehicle will be a brand shaper for us in India, we will launch it in October, Peter Kronschnabl, president of BMW India, had told The Telegraph at Siams annual convention on Friday.        
	The company is planning to sell 30-40 units of the car per annum, which is expected to be priced between Rs 50 lakh and Rs 60 lakh.        
	Sporting a 3-litre diesel engine, the new Z4 sports car, launched last December in Europe, now comes with a folding hard roof.

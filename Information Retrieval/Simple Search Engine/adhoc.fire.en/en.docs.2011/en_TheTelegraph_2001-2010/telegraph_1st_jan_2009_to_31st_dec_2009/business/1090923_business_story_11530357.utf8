          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Sept. 22: Advance taxes by companies have already more than doubled in the second quarter compared with the first quarter (April-June), a sign of the economy slowly gaining growth momentum, according to the finance ministry.        
	Corporate taxes till September 15 were a strong Rs 44,010 crore compared with Rs 20,720 crore in the first quarter.        
	Further good news came with the Asian Development Bank (ADB) upgrading its growth forecast for 2009-10 to 6 per cent from 5 per cent made in March. These tax figures clearly indicate that the economy is back on a growth trajectory, said top finance ministry officials.         
	Finance minister Pranab Mukherjee had earlier said the economy could be expected to grow 6.1 per cent by the fourth quarter of 2009-10.         
	The governments massive expenditure programme, and its tax cuts along with low interest rates have helped the economy to perk up after slumping in the December quarter.         
	In its latest Asian Development Outlook released today, the ADB, too, attributed its higher forecast to government spending. Emerging signs of a recovery in private business confidence and a continued large fiscal stimulus announced in the July 2009 budget helped bolster Indias projected economic expansion to 6 per cent this year, upgraded from 5 per cent in March.         
	The government plans to spend more than Rs 10 trillion in this fiscal on the rural job guarantee scheme and infrastructure projects such as highways, airports and inner city transportation.        
	The top 50 corporate tax payers paid over 50 per cent more in advance taxes than in the previous quarter. The State Bank of India remained No. 1 with a contribution of Rs 1,830 crore.        
	Other major contributors include ONGC which paid Rs 1,796 crore and Reliance Industries, Rs 1,160 crore.         
	Several firms including Grasim, ACC, the State Bank of Hyderabad and the Bank of India paid 200 per cent or more in taxes compared with the previous quarter.         
	Maruti, Infosys paid nearly 100 per cent more, while banks such as Canara and the Oriental Bank of Commerce paid 100-200 per cent more.         
	Officials said the advance tax figures for the September quarter indicated that services such as banking and software and industries such as automobile and cement have shown strong recovery. However, realty and metals remained downcast.         
	The manufacturing sector has definitely shown strong growth on account of a strong rural demand in the domestic market though service and agriculture sectors have not done so well, said D.S. Rawat, director-general of Assocham.        
	IMF alert        
	The IMF today said the global financial crisis could impair economic growth for at least 7 years and suggested structural reforms could help limit the damage.

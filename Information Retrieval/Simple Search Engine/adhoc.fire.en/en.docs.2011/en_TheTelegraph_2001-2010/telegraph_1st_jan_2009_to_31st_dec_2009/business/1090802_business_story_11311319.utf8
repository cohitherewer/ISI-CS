The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Suzlon suffers quarterly loss
                                                                                                               Suzlon suffers quarterly loss
                            
	Mumbai, Aug. 1 (PTI): Wind turbine maker Suzlon Energy has suffered a consolidated net loss of Rs 452.67 crore for the first quarter ended June 30 on lower sales volumes. The company had a profit of Rs 9.3 crore in the same period last fiscal.        
	While we have registered a growth in revenues at the consolidated level, our profits have lagged because of lower quantity of sales at the Suzlon Wind level.        
	This has been caused by multiple factors such as the delayed budget impacting orders in India, and customers in international markets postponing deliveries to the second half of the financial year, Sumant Sinha, Suzlons chief operating officer, said.        
	Total income stood at Rs 4,171.35 crore during the reporting quarter against Rs 3,126.97 crore in the same quarter a year ago.        
	Sinha, however, said the company would be able to get closer to its stated guidance of 2,400-2,600MW sales during this fiscal, down from 2,790MW in the previous fiscal.        
	On a stand-alone basis, the company suffered a net loss of Rs 160.47 crore in the said quarter. It had a net profit of Rs 88.04 crore in the same period last year.

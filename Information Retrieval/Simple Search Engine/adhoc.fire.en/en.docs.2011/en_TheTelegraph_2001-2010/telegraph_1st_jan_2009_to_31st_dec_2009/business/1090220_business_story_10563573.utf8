The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Cost-cutting exercise in full swing
                                                                                                               Cost-cutting exercise in full swing
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                    
	Hyderabad, Feb. 19: Satyam today relocated onsite support staff, put a freeze on some expenses and curbed training programmes to cut costs.        
	As a policy, the pre-sales, solution architect, delivery and operational support personnel will be located in the low-cost countries. All units have to sharply reduce (by more than 60 per cent) non-billable domestic and international travel, Satyam chief A. S. Murty said in an email to employees.        
	He said all capital expenditures, unless required to meet customer deliveries, were being suspended till further notice.         
	This includes renewal of laptops and office renovation. These measures are necessitated not just because of our financial situation, but are relevant given the larger economic slowdown.         
	The company has also suspended external training.         
	We will maximise the use of internal training facilities and instructors, Murty said. The company will also terminate the lease of several rented premises.        
	Satyams employees are not amused by the curbs, unhappy as they are by a proposal floated at a board meeting to change the name of the company. Many new names are flying around and we apprehend the death of the brand value built around Satyam, a senior employee said.        
	Many of the staff are spooked by the possibility of layoffs following the induction of a strategic investor. The HR division has been asked to categorise them as must, not-must and dispensable.        
	The only bright spot today was the announcement by a spokesperson for Satyam that the company had bagged 15 projects from existing clients and would pay the March salaries on time.         
	Sebi grilling        
	A Sebi team today questioned the former executives of Price Waterhouse, S. Gopalakrishnan and Talluri Srinivas, at the Chanchalguda jail here.        
	Yesterday, the Andhra Pradesh CID seized a locker belonging to B. Ramalinga Raju, which contained, among other things, a photocopy of the passport of former Satyam director Krishna G. Palepu.

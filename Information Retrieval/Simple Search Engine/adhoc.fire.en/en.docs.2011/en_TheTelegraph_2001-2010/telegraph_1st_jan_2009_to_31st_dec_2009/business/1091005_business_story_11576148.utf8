        Subhash Lakhotia ponders on the housing problem in the country and prepares a wish list for the government                                            
	Home is where one starts from, wrote T.S. Eliot. It is one of the most basic needs of a person. Owned or rented, sprawling or cosy, a stable home is everybodys dream.        
	However, India has a severe housing shortage. Even as housing continues to be one of the important issues on the governments agenda, not much has been done for the millions of Indians trying to find affordable and comfortable living.         
	In this article, we suggest some practical pointers, which if taken into consideration by the government, could improve the housing situation in the next five years.        
	The income tax law needs to be modified to provide complete deduction on interest paid on a loan taken to build ones first residential house.         
	The law now provides for a deduction of Rs 1,50,000 on interest on home loan but the proposed direct taxes code aims to do away with this deduction.         
	However, the government should instead provide tax deduction on interest payment without any upper limit if it is the first residential property of a person.         
	This will encourage most tax-paying individuals to buy a house of their own.         
	On rent        
	More houses put up for rent could also solve the housing needs of many. To encourage more people to let out their properties, the government should provide a special exemption for small residential apartments given on rent.         
	If the income from studio apartments and one room flats is exempted from the purview of income tax for the next 10 years, we could see a boom in the rental housing sector.         
	In the past two decades, rental income from new houses was exempted up to a particular limit for the first five years and now is the time to reintroduce this provision so that rental housing grows.        
	At least the standard deduction that is available now at the rate of 30 per cent should be enhanced.         
	If the government increases this standard deduction from rent, specially on residential property to 50 per cent, then investors would be tempted to put money in rental housing for residential use.         
	However, the proposed direct taxes code aims to cut this standard deduction to just 20 per cent.         
	Luring developers         
	Entrepreneurs can be encouraged to enter the housing sector by making construction and development of small residential houses completely tax exempt within the framework of the present income-tax law.         
	At present, a deduction is allowed to real estate developers under section 80IB(10).         
	However, this deduction should be on an ongoing basis and be made available without any specific deadline and the conditions to claim and enjoy this tax benefit should be made simple and hassle free.         
	Stamp duty        
	The stamp duty on property transactions should also be slashed to 1 per cent only.         
	In many developing countries we have seen that lower stamp duty has resulted in housing growth.         
	Hence, the government should bring about a uniform rate of stamp duty in the country. If the stamp duties are reduced, it is expected that the turnover of property transactions will increase.        
	Wealth tax        
	Small apartments should be kept outside the wealth tax law. This will surely encourage entrepreneurs to invest in residential housing in bulk just as they buy shares of companies or units of mutual funds.        
	Capital gains        
	The provisions of the capital gains tax should be liberalised to extend the benefit to investments in multiple residential apartments instead of restricting the investment to one property.        
	Real estate investment trusts have not yet taken off in India. The government should encourage the setting up of small real estate investment trusts, which would cater to the needs of small investors in the residential sector.        
	Land procurement        
	The government should consider procuring land and asking private developers to build housing blocks under a public- private partnership model.         
	Special tax incentives should be provided to developers involved in such public-private projects.         
	Small towns        
	The government should prepare a list of 20 satellite towns to be developed near big cities. The towns will enjoy all the facilities of the big cities, encouraging people to shift to these new satellite towns. These 20 towns should be developed in five years.         
	The income generated from residential projects in these satellite towns should be completely tax free.        
	The government has proposed the concept of presumptive rental income under the proposed direct taxes code. Such a provision would be a deterrent to the growth of the real estate sector.         
	Country roads        
	The government should encourage people to move to the country by extending some tax sops and providing better infrastructure facilities in the rural area.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | One price for RIL gas
                                                                                                               One price for RIL gas
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Mumbai, Jan. 12: The Centre will file an affidavit on Tuesday before Bombay High Court on the sale of gas from the Krishna-Godavari basin.         
	The Centre is likely to state that the price of $4.2 per million British thermal unit (mBtu) will be applicable to all buyers irrespective of whether they are government-owned or private entities.        
	Mohan Parasaran, additional solicitor general, said the government had devised a price-fixing formula for the sale of KG gas. The benchmark price had been fixed at $4.2 per mBtu for KG basin gas, which had been approved by the empowered group of ministers.        
	Parasaran is representing the government in the ongoing dispute between Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL) and Reliance Natural Resources Ltd (RNRL). The additional solicitor general told a division bench today that the government had rejected the price of $2.34 per mBtu for RNRL as it was not arrived at on an arms length principle.        
	The Centres submission could be crucial for National Thermal Power Corporation, which is also locked in a dispute with RIL over the purchase of gas from the KG basin. RIL had earlier agreed to supply 12 million metric standard cubic meters per day of gas to NTPC at $2.34 per mBtu for 17 years.

          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Sept. 10: Telecom PSUs  Bharat Sanchar Nigam Limited and Mahanagar Telecom Nigam Limited  are finding the African market an attractive proposition.        
	Average revenues per user in Africa are higher than in India because of increasing coverage and competition in the latter.         
	In August, the number of GSM subscribers in India rose 93 lakh to 33.54 crore  against a total population of around 112 crore  according to data released by telecom body Cellular Operators Association of India.        
	However, the duo are not keen on acquiring a controlling stake in Kuwaits largest telecom company Zain.        
	Both the state-owned firms have the money to spend on acquisitions  BSNL has cash reserves of around Rs 37,000 crore and MTNL, Rs 11,000 crore.        
	On Tuesday, Bard al Khorafi, whose Khorafi Group holds 20 per cent in Zain, announced that the group along with some other shareholders were selling 46 per cent of Zain to a consortium comprising Malaysias al Bukhari Group, BSNL, MTNL and another Indian firm, the little-known Vavasi.         
	Delhi-based Vavasis website does not say who the promoters are and their source of funds.         
	Till last year, the company had been backed by Sam Pitroda  the chairman of the National Knowledge Commission.

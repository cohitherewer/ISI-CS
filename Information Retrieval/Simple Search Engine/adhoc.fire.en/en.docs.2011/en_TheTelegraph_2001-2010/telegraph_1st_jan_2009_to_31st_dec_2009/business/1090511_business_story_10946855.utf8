	New Delhi, May 10: India has initiated the most anti-dumping investigations between July and December 2008, numbering 42.        
	According to the World Trade Organisation, India is followed by Brazil and China.         
	Most of the investigations are against Chinese items; product-wise, metals, chemicals and textiles topped the list.        
	According to Indian officials, the global recession has badly roiled Chinas export market in the US and the European Union, prompting it to divert products to India and Africa.        
	World-wide, the WTO says, 208 anti-dumping investigations were launched last year compared with 163 in 2007 and 202 in 2006.        
	Countries initiate anti-dumping investigations to ascertain whether their domestic industries have been hurt. Duties are imposed on the basis of the probes.        
	Under WTO rules, countries must justify the duties by not only proving that goods have been brought cheaply but also showing that local firms have suffered.         
	Chinas imports to India have increased around 20 per cent in the last one year, worrying industry and the government. During April to December 2008, imports from China jumped to $24.2 billion from $19.8 billion in the corresponding period a year ago.        
	Industry is concerned. In this time of global recession, dumping can become a serious issue. China poses the greatest threat to the Indian industry at this juncture, the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry has said.        
	According to Rajiv Kumar, director of the Indian Council for Research on International Economic Relations, The reason for the surge in Chinese imports is not always that they are hugely subsidised by the Chinese government as is often claimed by our industry representatives. In cases where this can be established, anti-dumping measures must be taken.         
	For a great majority of imports from China, we must face the reality that they are cheaper because of the enormous economies of scale that are being achieved by the Chinese manufacturers, he said.         
	India has initiated around 17 anti-dumping cases against China since October last year.        
	Commodities most frequently under the scanner were stainless steel, yarn and fabrics, and aluminium products.

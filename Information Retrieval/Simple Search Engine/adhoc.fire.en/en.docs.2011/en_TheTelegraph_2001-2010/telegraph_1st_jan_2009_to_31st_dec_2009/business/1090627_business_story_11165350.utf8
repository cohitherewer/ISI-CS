                                                                                                               Sun Pharma outfit gulps bitter US pill
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                            
	Mumbai, June 26: Sun Pharmaceutical Industries today faced a major setback when the US Food and Drugs Administration (FDA) seized drugs produced by its US subsidiary Caraco Pharmaceutical Laboratories for violating manufacturing standards.        
	The development has serious implications for Sun Pharma. Analysts warned that if the FDA went ahead and banned the products, its topline could be impacted. It is feared that Sun Pharmas sales on a consolidated basis could be hit by around 12 per cent.        
	Apart from Sun Pharma, the development has ramifications for the domestic pharmaceutical industry.        
	Sun Pharma holds a 76 per cent stake in Caraco. On a consolidated basis, Sun Pharma recorded net sales of Rs 4,272.30 crore in the year ended March 31, 2009.         
	Exports constitute nearly 47 per cent of Sun Pharmas topline. While the company exports drugs to developed countries, Caraco also markets drugs made by Sun.        
	The news impacted the Sun Pharma stock which plunged over 12 per cent to Rs 1,140.45 from the previous finish of Rs 1,298.45.         
	During intra-day trades, the share plummeted nearly 18 per cent to touch a days low of Rs 1,070.        
	Last September, the FDA had banned the import of more than 30 generic drugs of Ranbaxy Laboratories Ltd because of manufacturing violations at two plants.        
	In May this year, the agency warned Lupin about irregularities at its manufacturing facility at Mandideep in Bhopal after its inspections showed deviations from US regulations.

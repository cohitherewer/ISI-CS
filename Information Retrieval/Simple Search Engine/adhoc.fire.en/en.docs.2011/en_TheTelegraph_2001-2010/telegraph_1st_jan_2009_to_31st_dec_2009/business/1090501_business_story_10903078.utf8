                                                                                                               CESC after-tax profit up 15.5%
          OUR BUREAU                                            
	April 30: Power generator CESC has reported a 15.5 per cent rise in profit after tax in 2008-09, while sales increased 9 per cent to cross the Rs 3,000-crore mark for the first time.        
	Net profit touched Rs 410 crore compared with Rs 355 crore in the previous year. Net sales went up to Rs 3,098 crore during the year against Rs 2,843 crore in 2007-08.        
	In the fourth quarter, net profit increased 9 per cent to Rs 94 crore from Rs 86 crore, while sales went up 15.4 per cent to Rs 754 crore from Rs 653 crore in the corresponding period last fiscal.        
	Sanjiv Goenka, vice-chairman of RPG Enterprises and CESC, said the current fiscal augured well for the company as a new unit of 250 mega watt will be commissioned in Budge Budge.        
	This unit will help us meet the unprecedented demand of power being witnessed this year, he said.        
	Goenka said CESC had done well so far in meeting the challenge during the summer. He said the financial closure for the first phase of the Haldia plant would be done later this year.        
	Poor show        
	Two Anil Ambani group companies today reported lower profits for the fourth quarter ended March 31, 2009.         
	Reliance Communications (R-Com) posted a net profit of Rs 1,454 crore for the quarter, down 3.2 per cent from Rs 1,503 crore in the same period last year. Reliance Capitals profit dropped to Rs 331.44 crore from Rs 386.49 crore in the same quarter last year.        
	However, the R-Com numbers surpassed estimates as analysts had expected the telecom firm to report profits in the region of Rs 1,300 crore because of the investment made towards the launch of its GSM services in 2008-09.         
	R-Com said the companys capex intensity would sharply dip in the current fiscal. It estimates capex in 2009-10 at Rs 10,000 crore, lower than Rs 15,000 crore expected earlier.        
	Chairman Anil Ambani said, R-Com has completed the worlds largest network roll-out in 2008-09 ahead of schedule and at a very competitive cost  around 35 per cent lower than the original guidance. We are confident of improved performance in the coming years.        
	Reliance Capital posted a lower profit despite a higher topline during the quarter. Total income of the company rose to Rs 850.98 crore in the fourth quarter from Rs 799.29 crore in the year-ago period.

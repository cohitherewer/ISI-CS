The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Curse on holy day spooks staff
                                                                                                               Curse on holy day spooks staff
          G.S. RADHAKRISHNA                          Employees outside the Satyam head office in Hyderabad on Wednesday. (Reuters)                                   
	Hyderabad, Jan. 7: The auspicious day of Vaikunta Ekadasi  when people do something good  had all the forebodings of doomsday for the techies of Cyberabad as they stepped into Infocity, the headquarters and nerve centre of Satyam Computer Services.        
	We had been anticipating such a turn of events. But we never expected our leader will turn out to be a cheat, said a 42-year-old software engineer, who had put in almost 11 years at Satyam, half of them overseas and the rest in the swanky offices of the company in the citys hi-tech corridor.         
	The mood among the approximately 53,000 employees darkened after days of uncertainty caused by the aborted Maytas deal which triggered the crisis.         
	The events of the last two months have dealt a telling blow to the once-flying-high employees which not even the salary hike handed out last month has been able to cushion.         
	The management has assured us there will be no layoffs and the companys operations will go on as usual. Whatever has happened at the top will not have any direct effect on the employees. Everyone will get the salary, as promised, on time, said a middle management executive.         
	Many of the employees, concerned about their professional growth, were yearning for a change but the economic uncertainty kept them glued to the company, which was dubbed as being among the best in the industry. At least for a few months we cannot refer to Satyam in our CVs and cannot be choosers in the job market, said a junior with hardly four years of experience behind him.         
	Ram Mynampati, who took over as interim chief executive of Satyam, put out a mailer to all employees seeking their support in the hour of crisis while apologising to them and their families for the uncertainty and inconvenience caused. We are confronted with the challenge of continuing our business operations, he said. What we have been trained for, we will now put to work, he added.        
	Within minutes of the release of his letter to the media, Raju arrived at Infocity and was closeted with key aides.         
	We joined him for a walk in the corridor of the executive floor where he shook hands with several senior colleagues and thanked them for their support, said a senior colleague of Raju.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | MTN seeks Sebi view on Bharti deal
                                                                                                               MTN seeks Sebi view on Bharti deal
          OUR BUREAU                              
	July 23: The representatives from MTN of South Africa met market watchdog Sebi today to seek clarity on regulatory issues surrounding the proposed merger of the African telecom giant with Bharti Airtel to create a $23-billion colossus.        
	Under the terms of the deal now being negotiated, Bharti Airtel will acquire 49 per cent of MTN. It will also issue global depository receipts (GDRs) to MTN, giving the South African entity a 25 per cent economic interest in Bharti Airtel. In addition, certain MTN shareholders will pick up another 11 per cent in the Indian telecom giant.        
	Early this month, Sebi said MTN would not have to come out with an open offer if it bought the GDRs. However, it would have to do so when it converted the GDRs into shares.        
	The regulatory hurdle puts MTN in a pretty pickle: it cannot exercise voting rights if it holds the GDRs, which means it wont be able to have a say in the running of Bharti Airtel.         
	If it converts the GDRs into shares, it will win voting rights but will then have to come out with an open offer, which will wreck the complex architecture of the deal.        
	The two companies will continue exclusive talks till July 31.        
	Talks are on between Bharti Enterprises, the parent of Bharti Airtel, and South Africas MTN Group to form a global business combination, Akhil Gupta, deputy group CEO and managing director of Bharti Enterprises, said after the announcement of the companys results. He refused to give out any further details.        
	Under the current regulations, if a buyer acquires more than 15 per cent of another firm, he will have to come out with an open offer to minority shareholders.         
	Sebi officials refused to comment on the discussions held today with MTN.

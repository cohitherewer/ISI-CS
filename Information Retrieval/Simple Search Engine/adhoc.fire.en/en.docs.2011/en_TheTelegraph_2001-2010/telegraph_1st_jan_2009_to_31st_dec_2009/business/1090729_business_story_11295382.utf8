          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Bhattacharyya: Concerned                                  
	Calcutta, July 28: West Bengal Power Development Corporation Ltd (WBPDCL)  the largest power producer in the state  lifted only 77 per cent of its allotted quota of coal in the first quarter of the current fiscal.         
	This comes at a time when the state power department and power firms have been blaming Coal India Ltd (CIL) for supplying less coal than demanded leading to widespread load-shedding.        
	Addressing reporters here today, CIL chairman Partha S. Bhattacharyya said, WBPDCL was almost lifting nothing from Mahanadi Coalfields Ltd (MCL) for unknown reasons.         
	He said CIL had decided to allocate less coal from Eastern Coalfields to WBPDCL because the ailing coal producer  which is still under the Board for Industrial and Financial Reconstruction  had not received Rs166 crore from the power firm.         
	ECL produces high grade coal with a calorific value of more than 6,000 kilo calories. WBPDCL, along with NTPC and CESC, wanted to buy these grade A and B coal at higher prices to substitute for imported coal. Since WBPDCL cannot pay a higher price, we allocated them fuel from Mahanadi Coalfields. But WBPDCL is not lifting coal from MCL and blaming us for supplying less coal, Bhattacharyya said.         
	WBPDCL managing director Debashis Sen, when contacted, didnt want to talk. Earlier, the power producer had alleged that coal from Mahanadi Coalfields had high ash and mud content.        
	Every thermal power station in the country has the ability to burn MCL coal. We do not get any complaint from Tamil Nadu and other states where we are supplying coal from MCL, the CIL chairman said.        
	Transport of coal from MCL to thermal power stations of WBPDCL in Bengal is also a problem. However, the railways have agreed to provide 12 rakes for coal transportation from MCL. This will solve the problem to a great extent, he said.        
	WBPDCL has signed a fuel supply agreement with CIL for 14.6 million tonnes (mt). Of this, ECL will supply 4.15mt, Bharat Coking Coal Ltd, 1.3mt and MCL, 9.15mt. Between April 1 and July 26, WBPDCL has lifted only 77 per cent of the proportionate quantity.

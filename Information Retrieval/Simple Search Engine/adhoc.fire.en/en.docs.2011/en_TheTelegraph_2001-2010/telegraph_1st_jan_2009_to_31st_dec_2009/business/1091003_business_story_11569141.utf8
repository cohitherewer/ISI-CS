                                                                                                               Videocon in talks to buy Finnish firm
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Mumbai, Oct. 2: Videocon Industries Ltd  the Rs 15,000-crore consumer durables firm  is close to buying loss-making Finnish company Elcoteq.        
	Videocon is expected to pay around $70 million for an unspecified stake in Elcoteq. The transaction is expected to be concluded by the end of this year.        
	Elcoteq makes mobile and wireless phones, accessories, set-top boxes and flat-panel television sets. The board of directors have given authorisation to proceed with the due diligence and contract negotiations with Videocon, the Finnish firm said in a communication to the stock exchanges.         
	Elcoteq clarified that the signing of an agreement was subject to successful senior and subordinated debt restructuring and completion of the due diligence process.        
	Videocon chairman Venugopal Dhoot confirmed the talks but declined to divulge details. We are interested in assets all over the world, he said.        
	The company is keen on buying distressed assets. It had acquired Thomsons colour picture tube manufacturing facility in Italy, China, Poland and Mexico and the Normandie brand in Europe.         
	Over the last three years, Videocon has made several attempts to increase its global footprint, including a $700-million failed bid for Daewoo and another one for a Japanese consumer electronics brand.         
	Videocons plan focuses on turning around loss-making units by bringing down manufacturing costs. Elcoteqs announcement follows an aborted deal to sell shares to China-based Shenzhen Kaifa Technology.

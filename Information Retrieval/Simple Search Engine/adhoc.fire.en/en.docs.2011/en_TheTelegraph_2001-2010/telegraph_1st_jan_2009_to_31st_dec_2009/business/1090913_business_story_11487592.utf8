                                                                                                               Date set for 3G spectrum auction
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                          Ready to go                                  
	New Delhi, Sept. 12: The auction of third-generation (3G) spectrum will begin on December 7, according to the timeline released by the department of telecommunications.        
	The 3G spectrum will help telecom operators provide high-speed Internet and data services to subscribers.        
	The sale of broadband and WiMax radio waves would start two days after the close of the 3G auction, the telecom department said.        
	The government has fixed the reserve price for the auction of third-generation radio waves at Rs 3,500 crore. On the other hand, the base price for wireless broadband spectrum has been set at Rs 1,750 crore.         
	According to the policy, five players will be allowed to offer 3G services in each circle and one slot will be reserved for state-owned telecom firms BSNL amp; MTNL. For broadband wireless access, three licences will be auctioned.        
	The telecom department will provide the information memorandum or tender document to potential bidders on September 29.        
	A tender or bid document contains detailed auction guidelines and 3G policy details, based on which potential bidders can plan their offer.        
	Usually, proposals inviting tenders with a copy of the 3G licence policy and detailed bidding guidelines are available at least three to four months ahead of the bidding.        
	The pre-bid conference would be held on October 12 and clarifications would be addressed on October 22, the DoT said.        
	Final date for accepting applications from potential bidders is November 13 and mock auctions will be held on December 3-4.        
	The third-generation mobile phone service, seen as the next growth driver for the Indian telecom sector, enables mobile users to get high-speed broadband connectivity on their handsets. It allows operators to offer data services such as video-on-demand and mobile TV.         
	Other than its high-end technological edge, 3G spectrum will help telecom operators to have more users using lesser bandwidth.        
	With the introduction of 3G and WiMax, wireless broadband is expected to get a boost, especially in rural areas.         
	The government, which expects 3G services to attract foreign players and help it to rake in high revenues, plans to raise around Rs 25,000 crore from the sale of 3G and WiMax radio waves.        
	Global players such as UKs AT amp;T, Deutsche Telekom, Frances Orange and Japans NTT DoCoMo are keen on bidding for 3G spectrum.         
	Domestic players that are expected to be in the fray are: Bharti Airtel, Vodafone Essar, Reliance Communications, Tata Teleservices and a few new private telecom operators such as Unitech-Telenor and Sistema-Shyam.        
	The 3G auction was originally scheduled to be held in October last year. It got delayed by almost a year because of inter-ministerial disagreements over issues such as the reserve price and the number of blocks to be auctioned.

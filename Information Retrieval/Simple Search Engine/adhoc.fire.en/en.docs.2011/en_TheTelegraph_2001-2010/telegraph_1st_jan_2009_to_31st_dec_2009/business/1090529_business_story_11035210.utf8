	New Delhi, May 28: SAILs quarterly profit for the January-March period of 2009 fell 37 per cent and its annual profit for 2008-09 dropped 18 per cent because of a dip in steel prices and rise in costs as the economy slowed down.        
	However, the steel maker said it planned to spend Rs 10,000 crore on capital expansion during the year ahead, with borrowing accounting for nearly half of it.         
	Net profit for the whole year fell to Rs 6,188 crore compared with Rs 7,548 crore in the previous year, while net profit for the last quarter was down sharply to Rs 1,486 crore compared with Rs 2,376 crore for the same period last year.         
	The dip in profit happened as revenues for 2008-09 rose 10 per cent to Rs 44,529 crore from Rs 40,530 crore in the year-ago period.        
	SAIL attributed the profit dip to a sharp drop in prices in the second half of the year and rising input prices, especially coking coal, which went up over 200 per cent.         
	However, SAIL chairman S.K. Roongta said, Realisations in the first quarter will be higher compared with the fourth quarter because of lower costs.        
	Long-term coking coal prices, which surged to $300 a tonne, have come down to $125 a tonne for major buyers.         
	SAIL has also been scouting for mines abroad on its own as well as through a joint venture with other state-run companies.         
	In Mozambique, we are looking at four blocks but nothing has been concluded, Roongta said.         
	Roongta said the Jharkhand government had agreed to recognise SAIL as IISCOs successor company in leasehold rights at Chiria.

                                                                                                               Funds boost for Nepal infrastructure
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Aug. 23: India will invest in infrastructure facilities in Nepal to boost bilateral ties. The countries have also agreed on a broader trade agreement, under which steps will be taken to control the illegal entry of goods from a third country.        
	The trade treaty, which was being negotiated for two years, is meant to replace the agreements of 1991 and 1996 that give goods manufactured in Nepal a duty-free access in India.        
	The two sides completed the negotiations and initiated the revised Treaty of Trade and Agreement of Cooperation to Control Unauthorised Trade, which will enhance bilateral trade, according to joint statement issued at the conclusion of the visit of Nepalese Prime Minister Madhav Kumar Nepal during which he held talks with counterpart Manmohan Singh.         
	India will invest Rs 1,485 crore to beef up Nepals road and rail links in the underdeveloped Terai region. The Vishakhapatnam port will also be allowed to be used for the movement of transit traffic to and from the Himalayan neighbour. Nepals request for using an additional port on the west coast will be favourably considered as well.        
	The statement said a new agreement on avoiding double taxation and investment protection would be signed soon to address the concerns of businessmen.         
	At present, India accounts for 70 per cent of Nepals external trade and about 44 per cent of foreign direct investment. Trade between the two countries stood at $1.9 billion in 2008-09 and is expected to reach $3 billion this fiscal. Nepal has also requested India to consider removing the ban on the export of essential commodities. To improve rail connectivity, two cross-border links, including the Jogbani-Biratnagar route, will be built with Indian assistance at an estimated cost of Rs 680 crore.        
	Kathmandu plans to generate 25,000MW of hydroelectricity over the next 20 years. The two countries have agreed to expedite the construction of the Dhalkebar-Muzaffarpur 400KV cross-border transmission line for which the modalities are to be developed.

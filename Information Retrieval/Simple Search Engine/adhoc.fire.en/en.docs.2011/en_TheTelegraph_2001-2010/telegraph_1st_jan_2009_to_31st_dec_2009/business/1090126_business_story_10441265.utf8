The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Guessing game on RBI rate strategy
                                                                                                               Guessing game on RBI rate strategy
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          TAKING STOCK                                  
	Mumbai, Jan. 25: Bankers are divided over the RBIs stand on interest rate in its monetary policy review on Tuesday.        
	Many feel the slow pace of growth and comfortable inflation levels may prompt the central bank to cut the repo and reverse repo rates by 50 basis points each.         
	Repo is the rate at which the central bank lends to banks in the short term, while reverse repo is the rate at which it borrows from banks.        
	However, a section of bankers expects the RBI to maintain status quo as it has already cut rates a number of times since October and may prefer to hold fire.         
	On January 2, the RBI cut the cash reserve ratio (CRR) by 50 basis points to 5 per cent and the reverse repo and repo by 100 basis points each to 4 per cent and 5.5 per cent, respectively.        
	Since October, it has slashed the repo by 250 basis points and CRR by 350 basis points. CRR is the portion of deposits which banks must maintain with the RBI. Through the CRR cuts alone, the Reserve Bank has injected over Rs 3 lakh crore into the system.        
	According to Harihar Krishnamurthy, country treasurer at Development Credit Bank, RBI governor D. Subbarao is unlikely to tinker with the key rates on Tuesday.        
	The system is sitting on a surplus liquidity of over Rs 50,000 crore. Inter-bank call rates are between 4-4.25 per cent and yield on the benchmark 10-year security is around 6 per cent. Therefore, the markets are not demanding a cut in repo, reverse repo or CRR, Krishnamurthy told The Telegraph.        
	He said the central bank could reduce the rates later when liquidity in the system became tight on account of government borrowing or advance tax outflow.        
	However, Abheek Barua, chief economist at HDFC Bank, said the RBI could slash the repo and reverse repo rates by 50 basis points each and target an interim 100-basis-point cut in CRR between February and March.        
	Barua said rapidly declining inflation should give the RBI sufficient scope to ease the monetary policy further and take pre-emptive measures to contain decelerating growth.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Farmers get access to cheap money
                                                                                                               Farmers get access to cheap money
          R. SURYAMURTHY                                            
	New Delhi, July 6: Giving a huge push to the farm sector, the government today announced loans at a subsidised interest rate of 6 per cent for farmers who pay their dues in time.        
	Last years farm loan waiver scheme was panned because it appeared to penalise those who paid their dues in time. Budget 2009 seeks to correct the anomaly by granting an interest rate that is one percentage point lower to creditworthy farm sector borrowers.        
	I am also happy to announce that for this year the government will pay an additional subvention of one per cent as an incentive to those farmers who repay their short-term crop loan on schedule. Thus, the interest rate for these farmers will come down to 6 per cent per annum, said finance minister Pranab Mukherjee.        
	The Centre has allocated Rs 411 crore more in this budget for this purpose over and above the allocation made during the interim budget.        
	Mukherjee said the government would continue the interest subvention scheme on short-term crop loans of up to Rs 3 lakh at 7 per cent interest rate. The government also raised the target of agricultural credit for 2009-10 to Rs 3,25,000 crore after achieving last years target when the government had disbursed Rs 2,87,000 crore of farm loan against the target of Rs 2,80,000 crore.        
	Mukherjee said the debt waiver scheme, announced during 2008-09 budget, would be extended by six months  till December 31 this year, in view of the delay in monsoon. The Rs 71,000-crore scheme, which covered four crore farmers, had ended in June 2009.              
	He also announced setting up a task force to examine a large number of farmers in parts of Maharashtra who had been left out of this scheme as they had taken loans from private money lenders.               
	Indias farm sector, which accounts for 16.3 per cent of the countrys GDP, grew at a sluggish 1.6 per cent in fiscal 2008-09 against growth of more than 4.9 per cent since 2005-06.              
	In a bid to restore agricultural growth to the level of 4 per cent achieved in recent years, the finance minister proposed a significant 30 per cent increase in allocation for the agriculture ministrys flagship scheme, Rashtriya Krishi Vikas Yojna (RKVY).              
	The outlay for RKYV has been earmarked at Rs 4,100 crore for 2009-10, up 30 per cent from 2008-09. Assistance is provided under this scheme to the states to cover the critical gaps in the process of agricultural development.              
	The outlay for the Accelerated Irrigation Benefit Programme (AIBP) has also been stepped up by 75 per cent to help achieve the same objective by bringing more area under assured irrigation.              
	The total Central plan outlay for the agriculture and allied sectors has been raised by Rs 555 crore from Rs 10,074 crore (budget estimates) in 2008-09 to Rs 10,629 crore for 2009-10. This is Rs 660 crore higher than the 2008-09 revised estimates of Rs 9,969 crore.

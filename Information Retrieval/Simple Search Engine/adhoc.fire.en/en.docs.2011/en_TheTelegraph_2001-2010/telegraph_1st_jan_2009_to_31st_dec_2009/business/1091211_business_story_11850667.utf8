	New Delhi, Dec. 10: Indias wholesale food price index rose 19.05 per cent in the 12 months to November 28, fuelling a lobbying war for and against a rate rise.         
	Many government economists feel a rate rise is needed to dampen inflationary expectations, but the industry associations are demanding a status quo and even a reduction as recovery is yet to gather pace.        
	The Reserve Bank had earlier said it had twin objectives in its monetary policy  reining in inflation, while encouraging growth.        
	However, the spurt in food prices and an increase in fuel prices  the first this year may lead to a greater emphasis on inflation control.         
	Food costs are rising as the weakest monsoon in 37 years has hurt farm output, raising the prices of wheat, rice and vegetables, among other agricultural items. Retailers have also made a killing, which has added to the price rise.         
	The RBI had earlier said monetary policy was an ineffective instrument to rein in growth in food prices, but its intervention might be needed to dampen inflationary expectations.         
	While bank deposits had grown 22 per cent till October, chambers said credit offtake had grown just 9 per cent in the same period because industry perceived lending rates to be high.         
	Lending rates of most banks range between 12 per cent and 15 per cent.         
	In a letter to finance minister Pranab Mukherjee, Assocham president Swati Piramal said banks might be sitting on a cash pile, but credit offtake was low and there was a strong case for reducing lending rates by at least 2 per cent. Ficci has gone a step further and sought a cut of 2.6 per cent in rates.        
	The chambers say higher rates have forced corporate houses to look at alternative funding such as qualified institutional placements, private equity, venture capital, mutual funds and foreign loans. However, many policy makers argue that the economy managed to grow 7.9 per cent in the quarter ended September and, therefore, industry may not be in need of crutches.

          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, July 2: The economic survey has suggested measures to increase credit flow and productivity in agriculture, including lifting a ban on futures trade in rice, sugar, tur and urad.         
	Lift the remaining ban on futures contracts to restore price discovery and price risk management ... the discovered price would help farmers and other stakeholders, the survey said.        
	Review and phase out surcharges, cesses and transaction taxes such as commodities transaction tax, it said. The move will ensure a zero-tax regime in commodity futures trade, which will help attract more participation.        
	The government has been asked to promote smart cards to farmers to access state-sponsored schemes.        
	Improving productivity and increasing net sown area for farming are vital tasks, the survey said. Developing rural infrastructure and connectivity are essential for the movement of farm produce.

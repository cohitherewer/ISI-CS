	Calcutta, May 9: The State Banks net profit for the January-March quarter rose 45.6 per cent to Rs 2,742 crore from Rs 1,883 crore in the year-ago period. The full-year profit jumped 35.5 per cent to Rs 9,121 crore from Rs 6,729 crore a year ago.         
	Primarily three factors contributed to this profit growth  income from treasury operations, fee income and growth in advances, SBI chairman . P. Bhatt said.         
	The banks non-interest income, including treasury profits on sale of investment and fee income, rose sharply by 45.6 per cent to Rs 12,690.79 crore from Rs 8,694.93 crore a year ago.         
	Treasury income alone grew 171 per cent to Rs 2,566 crore. Our fee income recorded a 32 per cent growth during the year, said S.K. Bhattacharyya, managing director of the SBI.        
	The SBI also clocked a 29.88 per cent growth in advances compared with the industry average of 19-20 per cent.         
	We introduced a number of loan products at cheaper rates during the year and that helped us grow the loan book, Bhatt explained.         
	Though the net interest margin continued to remain under pressure, a higher volume of advances contributed to profit growth, he added.        
	Total deposits of the bank grew 38.08 per cent or Rs 2,04669 crore during the year.         
	Term deposits, in particular, grew 41 per cent, Bhattacharyya said.         
	Despite declining interest rates on deposits, we saw fresh deposits of Rs 20,000 crore in April (the interest rate fell by 0.25 percentage points during the month), said Bhatt. This means there is enough liquidity available, he added.         
	During an interaction with reporters yesterday, Bhatt had said the bank would review its interest rates, both deposits and lending, by the end of this month.         
	The SBI has already reduced its interest rates on deposits by 0.25 percentage points with effect from May 4.         
	Net non-performing assets of the bank have declined to 1.76 per cent from 1.78 per cent a year ago, while gross NPAs slipped to 2.84 per cent from 3.04 per cent.         
	The capital adequacy ratio (Basel II compliant) of the SBI stood at 14.25 per cent at the end of March 2009 against the regulatory requirement of 9 per cent.        
	The board has proposed a 290 per cent dividend.

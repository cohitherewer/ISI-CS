The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Fiscal deficit set to soar
                                                                                                               Fiscal deficit set to soar

	New Delhi, Feb. 9: Indias fiscal deficit may balloon to Rs 2,25,000 crore  7-7.5 per cent of GDP  against an estimate Rs 1,33,287 crore made in the last budget.        
	Bloated subsidies, a farm loan waiver, pay hikes for civil servants and tax sops to revive firms have hurt the treasury.         
	Last year, the deficit was Rs 1,43,653 crore, or 3.1 per cent of GDP (gross domestic product).         
	This is perhaps the highest fiscal deficit in absolute terms. But the fact that our GDP has now grown to such a huge figure (Rs 33,51,653 crore) makes the deficit still manageable, said D. Joshi, chief economist with credit rating firm Crisil.         
	Suresh Tendulkar, chairman of the Prime Ministers economic advisory council, said the combined fiscal deficit of central and state governments could be 10 per cent of GDP.         
	Subsidies for fertilisers and food have doubled from an initial budget estimate of Rs 67,037 crore to Rs 1,23,464 crore.         
	Around Rs 71,680 crore was spent on a farm loan waiver, while Rs 22,000 crore was set aside for the increased salaries of civil servants.        
	The economic slowdown had forced the government to announce tax and subsidy reliefs worth Rs 40,000 crore and spend Rs 20,000 crore more on infrastructure.         
	It has also promised to issue bonds worth Rs 1,01,445 crore this year to oil companies which have to be counted as part of the governments borrowing programme.         
	The stress is evident, but all that the government has promised to spend may not really happen and the deficit may actually be contained, Joshi said.        
	Officials said the huge deficit would be discussed tomorrow at a meeting between the RBI and the officials of the ministry of finance.         
	The meeting will chalk out a revised borrowing programme.

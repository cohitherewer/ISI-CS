The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Emami counts gains from new ventures
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Emami counts gains from new ventures
          SAMBIT SAHA                          Growth shoots                                  
	Calcutta, Dec. 28: Emami has charted out a road map for the expansion of new businesses and plans to tap the capital markets for some of these.        
	We want to build a Rs 10,000-crore group in the next five years with major contribution coming from FMCG, paper, edible oil and cement, in particular, Radhey Shyam Agarwal, joint chairman and co-founder of Emami, told The Telegraph.        
	The group hopes to clock a revenue of Rs 3,000 crore during this fiscal, with FMCG and edible oil contributing Rs 1,000 crore each, and paper Rs 450 crore.         
	The first to get listed among all verticals will be Emami Infrastructure following the recast of the personal care and real estate businesses of Zandu and Emami.        
	Agarwal said Emami Paper was likely to come out with a public offer over the next 18 months to raise funds for expansion.         
	The company is already the largest manufacturer of newsprint in India. Though Emami Paper is listed on the Calcutta Stock Exchange, Agarwal wants a follow-on offer to list it on the BSE and NSE.        
	The next to go public is edible oil firm Emami Biotech.         
	The company is foraying into branded oil and setting up refineries across the country. Its first plant at Haldia in Bengal is already operational.        
	Cement would be the next one to take off from the starting block, in another two years, when the Chhattisgarh project kicks off, followed by healthcare.        
	In healthcare, the group runs two super speciality hospitals  AMRI in Salt Lake and Dhakuria and pharmacy chain Frank Ross. It is building two more in Bhubaneswar and Mukundpur on EM Bypass in Calcutta.        
	Agarwal said the group would spend Rs 6,000-7,000 crore to expand all the businesses.         
	A large part of the money could go into acquisitions as well. The group is looking at India and overseas for buyouts.

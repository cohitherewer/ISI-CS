	Mumbai, Feb. 8 (PTI) The Centres expenditure is set to rise 26 per cent in 2008-09 over the previous fiscal, the Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy (CMIE) said in its monthly review.         
	The increase is the highest since 1980-81, the think-tank said.        
	The spurt in fertiliser and food subsidies raised the governments budgeted expenditure for 2008-09 to Rs 8,98,976 crore from Rs 7,50,884 crore in February 2008,        
	The two supplementary demands for grants of Rs 1,05,612 crore and Rs 42,480 crore in October and December, respectively, pushed up the expenditure in fiscal 2009.         
	The revised expenditure is 19.7 per cent higher than the budget estimates.        
	As a percentage of GDP, the expenditure for 2008-09 works out to 16.5 per cent. This ratio is the highest in the recent five years.

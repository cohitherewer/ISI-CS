                                                                                                               High return on PF 
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                          Good show                                  
	New Delhi, April 6: The State Bank of India has given a return of 9.7 per cent on provident fund deposits for the quarter ended December 2008, which is over half a percentage more than that offered by private sector asset managers.        
	Three private fund managers, including HSBC Asset Management Company, ICICI Prudential AMC and Reliance AMC, offered an yield of 8.5, 9 and 9.1 per cent, respectively, between September 17 and December 31, said sources.        
	The EPFO, which manages the provident fund of about 4.4 crore depositors, allowed the three private fund managers to manage its incremental deposits of about Rs 25,000 crore per annum in July last year. The objective was to see an improvement in returns on the EPFOs investments.        
	Given the current scenario, the EPFOs returns on investments, specially in central and state government securities and special deposit schemes, are not sufficient to pay depositors an interest rate of over 9 per cent.

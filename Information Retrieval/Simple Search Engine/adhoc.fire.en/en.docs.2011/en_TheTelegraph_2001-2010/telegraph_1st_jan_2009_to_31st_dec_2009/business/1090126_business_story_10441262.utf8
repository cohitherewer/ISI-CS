The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Centre prepares more stimulants
                                                                                                               Centre prepares more stimulants
          JAYANTA ROY CHOWDHURY                                           
	New Delhi, Jan. 25: The Congress-led government is planning a third stimulus package focused more on interest and duty reliefs than tax sops.         
	Under consideration are interest subsidy, more import duty protection for local items and a refund on import levy.        
	It wants to announce the package before or with the vote-on-account in mid-February.         
	Cuts in fuel and cooking gas prices may be lumped together with the package to strike a chord with the masses before the general elections.         
	Since the government has till May to hold fresh elections to Parliament, it cannot present a budget for the whole year and has to place a vote-on-account so that the current team can continue to function till a new one is sworn in. A vote on account does not bring in fresh taxes but merely states incomes and expenses for the past year.        
	The only way to keep a slowdown at bay is to increase demand without compromising on inflation, top finance ministry officials said.         
	The stress would be on stimulating demand in manufacturing by bringing down bank loan rates and reducing prices.         
	According to the officials, a one per cent growth in manufacturing leads to a multiple increase in services sector growth.         
	Industrial growth in April-November 2008 was 3.9 per cent against 9.8 per cent in the year-ago period.         
	Industry has to pay an interest rate of 10-15 per cent though the RBI has steadily trimmed the rates since October.        
	The repo rate or the rate at which banks borrow from the central bank stands at 5.5 per cent.         
	Exporters are still paying 8-9 per cent interest rates despite a 2 per cent subsidy announced earlier.         
	On the governments agenda are further interest subsidies, import duty shield for certain sectors and even the ban of imported goods to protect domestic firms from cheaper alternatives. In interest, the government is likely to co-ordinate with the RBI.        
	Last week, the government banned the import of toys from China after cheap supplies had hit local players.        
	Officials said the third stimulus plan would be announced around the same time as newly elected US President Barrack Obamas $825-billion package.         
	As they prepare the new stimulants, policy-makers are keeping an eye on the budget deficit. The gap for this year has far exceeded the allocation.         
	Huge expenses on fuel and fertiliser subsidies, the Rs 71,000-crore farm loan waiver and the Rs 22,000-crore hike in the salaries of civil servants are weighing upon the government.        
	It neither has the resources to announce a massive package nor can it introduce fresh levies with only three-four months left for the general elections.         
	However, expenditure will be tailored to boost the economy through higher spending in selective infrastructure and social sector projects.         
	Besides, it can announce duty drawbacks for exporters, stricken by the global recession.         
	Garment exporters are demanding a 14 per cent duty drawback, an increase of 6 per cent. Indias apparel exports declined 11.29 per cent in November 2008.         
	Officials said a 3 per cent hike in duty drawback and an extra interest subsidy of 1 per cent could be considered for segments such as textiles, and gems and jewellery.         
	Government officials and ministers have been meeting the representatives of the garment, gems and handicraft industries to fashion the package.

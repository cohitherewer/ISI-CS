The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Lower subsidy bill boosts ONGC net
                                                                                                               Lower subsidy bill boosts ONGC net
          OUR BUREAU                          Sharma: Reaping gains                                  
	New Delhi, Oct. 29: State-run Oil and Natural Gas Corporation today reported a near 6 per cent increase in net profit at Rs 5,089.64 crore during the second quarter ended September 30 on account of a lower subsidy burden following the softening of global crude prices.        
	Based on fundamentals, I do not think crude prices may decline from the current levels. I see crude prices hardening, ONGC chairman R.S. Sharma told reporters.        
	The government has mandated that upstream oil firms such as ONGC will have to bear some of the losses borne by PSU refiners Indian Oil, Bharat Petroleum and Hindustan Petroleum for selling fuel below costs.        
	In the second quarter, though the burden was lower, ONGC still had to shell out Rs 2,630 crore, which had brought down its profits by Rs 1,491 crore to Rs 5,089.64 crore.        
	The subsidy payout was Rs 12,663 crore in the same period last fiscal.        
	Analysts, however, warned that the recent spurt in crude prices to around $80 per barrel could inflate the subsidy bill in the future.         
	ONGCs sales fell to Rs 15,080.59 crore from Rs 17,407.40 crore because of a dip in oil production and prices, the PSU said in a statement.        
	For the half-year ended September 30, 2009, net profit fell to Rs 9,937.56 crore from Rs 11,444.74 crore a year ago, mainly because of a lower per barrel realisation on crude sales. Crude prices had peaked $147 a barrel in August 2008.        
	The company paid Rs 3,059 crore towards fuel subsidies during the first half of the fiscal compared with Rs 22,474 crore in the corresponding period last year.         
	Profit in April-September would have been higher by Rs 1,733 crore, if there were no subsidies.         
	ONGCs sales dropped to Rs 29,959.86 crore in the first half of the fiscal from Rs 37,459.60 crore in the same period last fiscal.        
	Bharat Petroleum        
	Bharat Petroleum Corp Ltd, the countrys second biggest state refiner, today reported a net loss of Rs 158.77 crore for the second quarter of the current fiscal, mainly because the government did not issue it bonds to compensate for losses on the sales of cooking fuel.        
	Losses in the July-September quarter narrowed to Rs 158.77 crore from Rs 2,625.27 crore a year ago.        
	Cairn crude        
	The government has allowed Cairn India to sell crude oil from its Rajasthan fields to private firms Reliance Industries and Essar Oil. The company has also sought permission to export oil as the government-nominated PSU refiners are not able to buy the entire output.         
	The company reported a 62 per cent increase in net profit for the second quarter ended September 30 on enhanced production after the Rajasthan fields went on stream. Net profit increased to Rs 469.50 crore in July-September from Rs 293.30 crore for the corresponding quarter of the previous year, Cairn India said in a statement.

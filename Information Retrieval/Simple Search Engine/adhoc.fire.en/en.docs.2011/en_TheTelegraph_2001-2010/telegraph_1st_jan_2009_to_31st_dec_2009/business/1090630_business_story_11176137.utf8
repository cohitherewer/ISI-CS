          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Calcutta, June 29: Uco Bank plans to cut deposit rates by 50-100 basis points during the first week of July, chairman and managing director S.K. Goel said today.         
	We had a meeting on June 27 where we discussed a possible cut in deposit rates. We will take a final call after June 30, Goel said on the sidelines of a banking conclave organised by Ficci here.        
	The bank expects its net profit to rise 15-20 per cent during the April-June quarter against the corresponding period last year. Our profit for the quarter will be driven by treasury income, non-interest income and recovery of bad debts, Goel said.         
	He said the banks loan and deposit portfolios were expected to grow 17-18 per cent in the April-June quarter. We are experiencing a recovery of demand in infrastructure, auto, steel and cement, he said.        
	AllBank move        
	Allahabad Bank today reduced its benchmark prime-lending rate by 25 basis points from 12.25 per cent to 12 per cent, effective July 1, 2009.

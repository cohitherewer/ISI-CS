The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | UN to review contracts
                                                                                                               UN to review contracts
                            
	New York, Jan. 23 (PTI): The United Nations said it had suspended tainted Satyam Computer Services from the secretariats vendor database and placed all ongoing contracts with the company under review.        
	Satyam has been suspended from the UN secretariat vendor database. The information has been communicated to the UN procurement system and the UN Global Marketplace, UN procurement divisions integrated support service chief Kiyohiro Mitsui said.        
	Ongoing contracts with Satyam are currently under assessment, he said.        
	The UN, however, did not give reasons for its action against the Indian IT company, which is smarting from the shock of a Rs 7,000-crore accounting fraud engineered by its founder Ramalinga Raju.

	New Delhi, April 26: Policy-makers are preparing quick-impact stimulus packages in the hope that the plans will be adopted by the new government.        
	Usually, the finance ministry and the Planning Commission favour infrastructure development to revive the economy since it creates more jobs while infusing money into the system.         
	However, this time the mandarins are looking at other options as the poll contenders tom-tom solutions that involve huge expenses and lead to quick realisation of benefits.           
	Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, for instance, is talking of a 100-day revival plan. Such pronouncements have forced the officials to concentrate on short-term measures.  
	Besides quick gestation infrastructure projects where the money will get spent within this calendar year, officials are toying with the idea of deeper tax cuts, which can see the prices of manufactures falling, and their demand going up.         
	Officials said that another option was spending on projects that were nearing completion as the final results would be visible soon.        
	Economists are sceptical about such short-term solutions. According to D.K. Joshi, principal economist with rating agency Crisil, The stimulus steps taken so far and those that are in the pipeline have arrested growth from falling. That is a very big positive.         
	However, we dont think the stimulus measures the government can take can bring back 8-9 per cent growth. But still these measures are needed to keep GDP growth at 6 per cent, he said.        
	The pledge of more cheap grains to the poor rural families made by both the Congress and BJP is another way of increasing the disposable income  the poor saves on food and have some extra money on their hands.        
	Indias rural economy has been growing in the past few years thanks to higher food prices and near zero taxes on agriculture. According to estimates made by industry body Assocham, nearly 40 per cent of the countrys $280-billion retail market is in rural India, which is growing steadily at 10 per cent. The market for fast moving consumer goods in the rural areas is estimated to be growing at 40 per cent compared with 25 per cent in the urban areas. Another study says that nearly half of the 220 million rural households are potential buyers of automobiles because of higher farm subsidies and better prices.        
	Creating jobs and creating demand. These will be the two priorities of the new government and the bureaucracy and planners will be working out sets of possible policies to achieve that, said top officials.         
	Problems arose for the economy when the West plunged into a recession, taking with it Indias export sector, which saw 5 lakh job losses over October-December.        
	Exports make up 20 per cent of the GDP, but the feeling of gloom permeated the rest of the economy, and consumer sentiment took a hit.        
	Joshi said that to get high levels of growth, the environment in the West will have to improve. But steps here can at least stabilise us and lift the fear factor in the domestic market.         
	Officials said fiscal stimulus would be the main weapon to fight the slowdown as there was scope for just 50-100 basis points cut in the RBIs key policy rates. The problem is the fiscal deficit, which is projected at 6 per cent of the GDP in this fiscal.         
	Global rating agency Moodys today said the high deficit had made the countrys rating vulnerable to setbacks.

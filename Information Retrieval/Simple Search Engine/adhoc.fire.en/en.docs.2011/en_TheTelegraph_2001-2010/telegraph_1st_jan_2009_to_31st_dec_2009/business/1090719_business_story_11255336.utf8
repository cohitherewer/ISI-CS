          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                    
	New Delhi, July 18: The countrys foreign trade policy is likely to provide incentives for diversifying into new markets. The government is also considering fresh stimulus for exports in the trade policy that will be unveiled next month.        
	We will look at diversification. That is what we have been discussing with the industry so that other continents which have not been traditional destinations of Indian exports are covered, commerce ministry Anand Sharma told reporters here after meeting representatives of the Confederation of Indian Industry and the Federation of Indian Export Organisations.        
	The US and the European Union have been the traditional markets for Indian exports, which have been hit badly by the economic recession. Exports dropped 29.2 per cent from a year earlier to $11 billion in May, after sliding 33.2 per cent in April, the trade data said.        
	After growing at over 30 per cent in the first half of 2008-09, exports started contracting. The country reported exports worth $168.7 billion during the year, which is a meagre 3.4 per cent over the previous fiscal.         
	The minister said the new trade policy would contain a mix of fiscal incentives as well as simplification of procedures. We are consulting the stakeholders to find out how best can we respond to the global economic crisis to make exports globally competitive. The government will also support the labour-intensive manufacturing industry, he said.         
	A. Sakthivel, president of FIEO, said exporters were seeking enhanced and continued incentives under the focus market and focus product schemes. They also want the government to provide relief on state levies such as entry and sales taxes.        
	The foreign trade policy spells out the segments of priority in external trade and gives or withdraws incentives, depending on the countrys needs.

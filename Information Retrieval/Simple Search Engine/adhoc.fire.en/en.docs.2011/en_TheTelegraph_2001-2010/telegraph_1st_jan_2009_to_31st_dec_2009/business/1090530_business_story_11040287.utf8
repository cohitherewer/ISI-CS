          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Commerce and industry minister Anand Sharma in New Delhi on Friday. A Telegraph picture                                  
	New Delhi, May 29: The new government plans to sign trade agreements with Asean, South Korea and Nepal and hopes to achieve exports of $164 billion in 2009-10 with incentives to labour intensive sectors in the budget and the foreign trade policy.        
	We will shortly approach the cabinet on these free trade agreements, Anand Sharma, the new commerce minister, told reporters.        
	He said exports were expected to touch $164 billion in 2009-10, slightly lower than $168.7 billion in the previous year.        
	We shall look at the possibilities for more incentives. I will be discussing with the finance minister...some measures which will be announced in the next budget, Sharma said.        
	The minister would soon be interacting with trade and industry bodies to understand their difficulties. Whatever is required would be done in the coming weeks and months.         
	Additional steps to facilitate exports, including a reduction in transaction costs, will be announced in the foreign trade policy, which will be announced in August.                          
	However, Sharma ruled out a comprehensive review of the controversial amendments to the foreign direct investment policy made by his predecessor Kamal Nath in February.        
	I see no reason why a comprehensive review is required at this stage. Lets see how it functions, he said.

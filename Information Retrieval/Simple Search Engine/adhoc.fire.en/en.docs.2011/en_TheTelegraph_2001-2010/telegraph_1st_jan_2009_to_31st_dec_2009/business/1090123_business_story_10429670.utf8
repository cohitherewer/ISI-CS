                                                                                                               Maytas boards near exit door
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Jan. 22: The government plans to replace the boards of Maytas Infra and Maytas Properties in the next few days, officials said. The newly appointed Satyam board may be asked to run the two Maytas firms.        
	According to the officials, The three companies may be financially interlinked but they are in two different businesses. Therefore, the government may be hesitating in naming the same board.         
	The Centre wants the Maytas firms to be run properly so that it can recover the money due to Satyam investors, which may have been diverted to the two sister firms. State governments that have awarded large contracts to Maytas Infra are also anxious that a stable board executes the projects.        
	The Andhra Pradesh government has awarded infrastructure projects worth Rs 38,000 crore to Maytas Infra. The projects include the prestigious Hyderabad metro rail and the Machilipatnam deep water port projects.        
	Investigations into the Satyam fraud revealed that money could have been siphoned out of the company and pumped into Maytas via foreign funds.         
	Promoters have revealed that the real profit of Satyam is extremely low, below 3.5 per cent of the turnover. However, investigators believe the number to be at least three to five times of what it is being made out to be.         
	Expenses, including fictitious employee rolls, could have been used to divert money.         
	The Enforcement Directorate has started an independent probe into foreign funds which were invested in Satyam or any related firm in the last few years, and foreign currency raised by Satyam.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Crude shock for air fares
                                                                                                               Crude shock for air fares
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, June 17: Private carriers Jet Airways and Kingfisher Airlines today upped fuel surcharge by Rs 400 on all domestic routes because of a steep rise in aviation fuel prices.         
	The increase was necessitated by a sharp rise in ATF (aviation turbine fuel) prices by 33 per cent since March 2009, Jet said in a statement.        
	A Kingfisher spokesperson said, The hike will apply uniformly to all travellers across all distances and all classes, including Kingfisher Red.         
	Jet Airways said the fuel surcharge, which stood at Rs 3,400 per ticket after the increase, would also be levied on Jet Airways Konnect and JetLite flights, starting today.        
	The average fare for an economy class ticket in the Delhi-Mumbai sector for Jet or Kingfisher will now cost between Rs 5,500 and Rs 7,000.         
	On Monday, state-run oil firms hiked jet fuel prices by 12 per cent, the sixth increase since March 16.         
	ATF now costs Rs 36,252 per kilolitre in Delhi, Rs 3,949 more than what it was before the latest hike. In Mumbai, it is Rs 37,367 per kilolitre compared with Rs 33,260 earlier.         
	In Calcutta, ATF will be dearer at Rs 44,289 per kilolitre against Rs 40,230.05 per kilolitre, while in Chennai the price has been raised to Rs 40,024 per kilolitre from Rs 35,821.34 per kilolitre.        
	National carrier Air India said it would be able to take a decision in a couple of days. We are also seriously contemplating an upward revision in fuel surcharge in view of the continuous increase in ATF prices, said a spokesperson.         
	Air India currently levies fuel surcharge of Rs 1,950 and Rs 2,700 on tickets up to and beyond 750 km, respectively.        
	Kingfisher Airlines had earlier said it was examining the impact of the latest ATF price hike and would take a decision soon.         
	International crude oil prices are now ruling at a seven-month high of $72 per barrel. The rise in ATF prices, which constitute 40 per cent of airlines operating cost, has put pressure on cash-strapped domestic carriers.

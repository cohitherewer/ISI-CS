	New Delhi, June 5: General Motors India will roll out a slew of models, including a mini car priced at around Rs 4 lakh, by this year-end. The company hopes to achieve a growth of 10 per cent in 2009, despite a fall in sales in the first five months of this year.        
	The mini car will be in the upper end of the compact segment. It will be priced at around Rs 4 lakh, said Karl Slym, president and managing director, GM India.        
	The car will be developed on GMs Beat platform and manufactured at its Talegaon facility. As of now, the mini car will be manufactured in Korea and India. We are planning to export from India to the Asia Pacific region and Europe by 2010, said Slym.        
	GM India today launched the LPG version of its small car Spark, priced at Rs 3.52 lakh (ex-showroom Delhi).

	Calcutta, Nov. 11: Nasdaq-listed Logitech International the Swiss computer peripherals manufacturer  has agreed to buy video-conferencing company LifeSize Communications of Austin, Texas for $405 million.         
	This is a great exit, said Vab Goel of Norwest Venture Partners, who co-founded LifeSize and served on its board. LifeSize Communications has over 9,000 clients across 80 countries in large enterprises, small-to-medium businesses, public healthcare, education and government organisations. We expect this acquisition to extend our leadership in video communication beyond the desktop, Logitech president and chief executive officer Gerald P. Quindlen said.         
	The deal should have a neutral to slightly positive impact on the operating income in 2010-11, Logitech said. The company also makes speakers, webcams and keyboards. The acquisition is subject to customary closing conditions, including antitrust approval, and is expected to close in December. LifeSize has projected a revenue of around $90 million in 2009, which is expected to grow between 40 per cent and 60 per cent in 2010. In India, Logitech operates through a wholly owned subsidiary.

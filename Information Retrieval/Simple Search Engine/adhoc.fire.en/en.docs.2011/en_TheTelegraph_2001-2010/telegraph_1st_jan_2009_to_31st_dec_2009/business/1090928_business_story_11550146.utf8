The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Hotels see recovery signs 
                                                                                                               Hotels see recovery signs 
                            
	New Delhi, Sept. 27 (PTI) :The Indian hotel industry is on its way to recovery, as is evident from a Ficci survey where 75 per cent of the respondents said their business prospects would improve in the next six months.        
	While nearly 40 per cent of the participants said the industry performance was moderately-to-substantially better than the last six months, nearly 75 per cent felt the hotel industrys performance would improve in the next six months, the study said. Although the industry mood was fairly buoyant, the degree of optimism differed from four star and five-star categories to two-star and three-star ones.         
	Five-star hotels are seeing an improvement in business because of a rise in the number of foreign tourists. Domestic corporate travel is also showing revival signs.        
	The recession along with the Mumbai terror attacks in November 2008 had hit the hospitality sector and the average occupancy rate dropped around 50 per cent.

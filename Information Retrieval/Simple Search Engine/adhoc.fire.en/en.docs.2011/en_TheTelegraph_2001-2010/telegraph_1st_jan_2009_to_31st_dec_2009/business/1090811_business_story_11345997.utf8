The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Bharti faces deal dilemma
                                                                                                               Bharti faces deal dilemma
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                                        
	New Delhi, Aug. 10: Bharti Airtels proposed sweetener to clinch a deal with South Africas MTN can turn bitter for its own shareholders.        
	The companys plan to increase the cash component of the deal can affect its earnings per share, and shareholders may see a dilution in their stock value. The move will also increase Bhartis debt.        
	Taking on additional debt will increase the interest outgo for Bharti, impacting profits and EPS, said Harit Shah, telecom analyst at Angel Broking.        
	Talks of Bharti increasing the cash component by 10-15 per cent to about $6 billion compared with the originally estimated $4 billion have not been received well by investors. The Bharti Airtel stock today fell 2.5 per cent to Rs 374.15 on the Bombay Stock Exchange.        
	A 5-7 per cent increase in the net cash outgo is going to be positive for both the company and the shareholders. Anything higher will be taken negatively by the shareholders, said Shah.         
	MTN shareholders, including South Africas state pension fund Public Investment Corporation, want Bharti to hike the offer price 10-15 per cent, increase the cash component of the deal by reducing the share of global depository receipts and bear the foreign exchange risk till the deal is completed. Public Investment Corporation is the largest stakeholder in MTN.        
	According to Mahesh Uppal of telecom consultancy Com First, management control is a major issue in handing over MTN, South Africas largest telecom player, to Bharti as it may lead to political complications.         
	At the same time, if Bharti doesnt get control, it may not be able to reap dividends from the deal. The company plans to implement its low-cost model in MTNs African and West Asian markets, but this may not seem viable without control, analysts said.        
	Last year, talks had fallen through over who would control a merged entity.        
	The deal details announced in May reveal a complex structure in which both the firms will pay cash and equity for stakes in each other.         
	Under the terms of the deal, Bharti will take 49 per cent in MTN, while the latter will have a 36 per cent economic interest in the Indian company.        
	If successful, the transaction will be Indias biggest overseas deal, surpassing Tata Steels acquisition of Corus for $12.2 billion in 2007. It will also create a global telecom powerhouse, with more than 200 million subscribers and revenues of over $20 billion.

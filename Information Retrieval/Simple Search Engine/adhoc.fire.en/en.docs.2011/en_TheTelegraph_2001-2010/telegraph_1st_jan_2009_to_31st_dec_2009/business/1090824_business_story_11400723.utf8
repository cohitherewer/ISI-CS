The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Reopen hopes rise at Dunlop
                                                                                                               Reopen hopes rise at Dunlop
          SAMBIT SAHA                           Trouble ceases                                  
	Calcutta, Aug. 23: The Dunlop management is looking at reopening the Sahagunj factory in Bengal before the Pujas, bringing cheer to its 1,189 workers.        
	Dunlop has agreed to meet the demands of West Bengal State Electricity Distribution Company Ltd (WBSEDCL). The power utility had stopped supply to the unit as the tyre company owed it Rs 13 crore.         
	The company will clear the dues over a period of nine years and the power distributor will resume supply. Though the management had lifted suspension of work at the unit in March this year, production could not take off because of a lack of power.        
	Bengal industry minister Nirupam Sen told The Telegraph that negotiations between the Dunlop management and the state power body was on a positive track.         
	I am hopeful that Dunlop will reopen before the Pujas, Sen said.         
	It will take about two weeks to start production once power starts flowing. The Durga Puja is in the last week of September.         
	Dunlop chairman Pawan Ruia declined to comment on whether the two parties had agreed to bury the hatchet.         
	However, he had hinted that there could be good news next week after railway minister Mamata Banerjee chided him for not opening the plant at a meeting with industrialists in Calcutta on Friday.         
	Last year, Ruia had met Banerjee  well before her fortunes rose in the general election  to seek her suggestions on the companys revival.         
	Sources said the industry minister took the initiative to bring the Dunlop management and the WBSEDCL closer.         
	I am trying to do my job. But the state unit is run by an independent board which will take its own decision. I am hopeful of an out-of-court settlement soon, Sen said.         
	Dunlop took WBSEDCL to court for freezing the connection. The company is expected to withdraw the case if the two arrive at a solution.         
	The tyre company had run up an electricity bill of up to Rs 15 crore even when the plant remained closed under the erstwhile Chhabria management between 2000 and 2005. During that period, power was consumed by local families and small industries around the plant. The power distributor, however, never disconnected the supply, fearing a political backlash.         
	After Ruia took over Dunlop in 2005, the new management initially refused to clear the dues. Later, it agreed to pay over a period, but with a moratorium in the beginning, which the state body turned down.         
	When Dunlop failed to pay the current bill twice, WBSEDCL stopped supply on both the occasions. The company then went to court in January 2008 to seek redressal. The issue of old dues, which then came down to Rs 13 crore after Dunlop paid a portion, was also brought up in the courts.

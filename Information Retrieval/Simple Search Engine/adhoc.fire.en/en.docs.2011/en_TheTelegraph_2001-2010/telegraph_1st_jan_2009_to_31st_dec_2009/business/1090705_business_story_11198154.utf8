The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Reliance counters Anil plea
                                                                                                               Reliance counters Anil plea
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                            
	Mumbai, July 4: A day after Anil Ambani-led RNRL petitioned the Supreme Court, Mukesh Ambani-run Reliance moved the apex court, challenging the Bombay High Court judgment asking it to supply gas to the former at a price that is 44 per cent lower than fixed by the government.        
	Bombay High Court, in a ruling last month, had asked Reliance to supply gas to Reliance Natural Resources Ltd (RNRL) at $2.34 per million British thermal units (mbtu).        
	In its appeal filed in the Supreme Court today, Reliance Industries contended that the high court had erred in deciding the three terms  quantity, tenure and price of gas supply  to power plants of RNRL affiliates as the court had no jurisdiction.        
	The petition said the supply of gas, under the Ambani family agreement signed on June 18, 2005, was subject to all necessary approvals as required under the production sharing contract and the government policy.        
	RNRL yesterday said it was compelled to move the Supreme Court by RILs obstructionist position.         
	In the special leave petition filed in the apex court yesterday, RNRL had prayed that Reliance should be asked to execute a bankable gas supply agreement in line with the Bombay High Court order.        
	RNRL had said the high court order fully protects the right, entitlement and economic interest of the government.        
	On June 15, Bombay High Court had asked Reliance to honour a 2005 family agreement to supply 28 million cubic metres per day of gas from its Krishna-Godavari basin fields to RNRL at $2.34 per mmBtu for 17 years from the date of setting up of the Dadri power plant.         
	According to RNRL, the gas supply obligation of Reliance was a result of the business reorganisation of the company and was approved by the board of directors, over 20 lakhs shareholders of Reliance and by Bombay High Court in 2005. The business reorganisation had followed due process of law and had got a clearance from the central government.        
	Its petition further said the high court order was clear about the quantity of gas, the period of its supply, the price and other key terms.

          OUR CORRESPONDENT                          A. Raja in New Delhi on Tuesday. (PTI)                                  
	New Delhi, Sept. 8: The Centre plans to hold talks with the Bengal government to try solve the land woes faced by infotech companies in the state.         
	I will take it (land allotment issue) up with the Bengal IT minister and will try to work towards a solution. Whatever is possible within the federal polity, we will do that, telecom minister A. Raja said at an IT conference here today.        
	Bengal IT minister Debesh Das, who was also present at the conference, however, refused to comment. We (state government) have decided to provide only written comments on the issue, Das said.        
	Yesterday, the Bengal government had scrapped its ambitious IT park project on the outskirts of Calcutta, where tech majors such as Wipro and Infosys were supposed to set up shop. The proposed project was shelved following allegations of irregularities in land acquisition, fuelled by the recent Vedic Village fiasco. The IT township would have led to Infosys entry into Bengal and Wipros expansion in the state.        
	Last year, Infosys and Wipro had said that they proposed to invest Rs 500 crore each in the IT park, and together employ over 10,000 professionals.        
	The software industry says the decision to scrap the project will impact investment and employment plans of the other IT and BPO firms in the state.

	On 3G spectrum auction, Raja said, The government will announce this week the date for a conference with potential bidders.

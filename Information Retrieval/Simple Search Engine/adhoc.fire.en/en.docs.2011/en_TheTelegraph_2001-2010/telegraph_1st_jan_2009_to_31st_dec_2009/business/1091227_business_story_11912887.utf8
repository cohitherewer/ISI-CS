	New Delhi, Dec. 26: Domestic tourism is back on track.        
	The growth rate in tourism has jumped from a sluggish 6.9 per cent last year to 10-12 per cent, which is the average for this decade.         
	Initially, travel plans were curtailed and even cancelled because of the recession. The sentiment was against splurging on exorbitant foreign holidays despite the great deals being offered. Thus, domestic holidays were more in vogue, said Pradeep Lulla, president of the Travel Agents Federation of India.        
	According to the ministry of tourism, visits within the country increased to 563 million tourists in 2008 from 270 million in 2002. There were around 526.56 million tourists in 2007 compared with 562.92 million last year. Analysts expect the year to end with around 630 million local tourists.         
	Tour operators are cashing in on extended weekends and festive breaks to push sales.        
	A short window of escape is enough for people to go on a short vacation. An average spend for two nights for an upper middle class couple should be between Rs 8,000 and Rs 25,000, said Rajji Rai, president of the Travel Agents Association of India.        
	A three-night and four-day package to Goa will cost Rs 11,777 per person, while a four-night and five-day stay at Port Blair is priced at Rs 9,125 per person.        
	Pilgrimage has witnessed a growth of 20-25 per cent. For instance, we expect the Kumbh at Haridwar to earn more money for hoteliers and agents than the Commonwealth Games next year, said Manish Kumar, managing director of Absolute Management Services.        
	Experts say a sustained flow of creative ideas is important to keep the industry vibrant for local tourists.        
	Tourism products have a fatigue aspect. Even Kerala Tourism has to ensure that there are fresh features to sustain in a dynamic world, said P.K Mohankumar, COO of Gateway Hotels, part of Indian Hotels Company Ltd that owns the Taj group of hotels.         
	Prem Subramaniam, adviser-CSR of Infrastructure Development Finance Company, said experts were coming up with new ideas such as painting holidays and wedding locales to boost tourism.        
	Industry status        
	Tourism is likely to get industry status in the forthcoming budget, Union minister of state for tourism Sultan Ahmed said in Calcutta today.        
	We have demanded industry status for tourism and the finance ministry is examining the proposal, Ahmed said at an industrial trade fair. The industry status will help boost private investment in tourism, Ahmed added.

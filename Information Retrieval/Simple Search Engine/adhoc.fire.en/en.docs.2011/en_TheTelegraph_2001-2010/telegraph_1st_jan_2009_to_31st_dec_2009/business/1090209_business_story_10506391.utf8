The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Garment makers fear export dip, seek sops
                                                                                                               Garment makers fear export dip, seek sops
          R.SURYAMURTHY                          RELIEF CALL                                  
	New Delhi, Feb. 8: Garment firms expecting tough times have demanded reliefs, though exports have fallen just 1.2 per cent in April-December 2008.        
	The figures are from the Apparel Export Promotion Council (AEPC), whose member firms were the first to lay off workers.         
	The industry and the Federation of Indian Export Organisations, the apex body, attribute the job loss to the declining orders from abroad in the coming months.        
	If there is no stimulus package for the sector, there can be major job losses after March as order books are really bad, Rakesh Vaid, chairman of the AEPC told The Telegraph.         
	However, neither the garment manufacturers nor Fieo has been able to give any figures on the future orders.        
	Vaid said the industry had got little attention from the government, resulting in Bangladesh overtaking India. Vietnam is also poised to march ahead of India this year.        
	The global economic recession had led to customers such as Steve amp; Barrys and Mervyns filing for bankruptcy.         
	Buyers such as Pacific Swimwear, Lane Bryant, Fashion Bug and Catherines have shut hundreds of stores because of sliding sales.         
	Nearly 500,000 Indian workers have lost their livelihoods and the number can go up in the coming months.        
	Apparel exports are likely to fall 24 per cent short of the $11.62-billion target in the current fiscal and may total up to $8.78 billion, Vaid said.         
	The country is losing its edge in global markets, according to Vaid. The industry must move up the value chain to retain existing customers and capture new markets.        
	In 2007-08, India exported garments worth $9.69 billion, nine per cent more than the previous year.         
	The exporters are hopeful of a stimulus package soon.

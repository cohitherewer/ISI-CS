The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Negative S amp;P outlook rings fiscal alarm bell
                                                                                                               Negative S amp;P outlook rings fiscal alarm bell
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Thumbs down                                  
	Mumbai, Feb. 24: Indias sovereign credit rating stands in danger of crumbling to the status of a junk bond.        
	On Tuesday, Standard amp; Poors (S amp;P) lowered its outlook on India to negative from stable citing worries about its fiscal position.        
	S amp;P now has a BBB- long-term sovereign credit rating on India which is the lowest in its investment grade ratings.        
	The country had shed its junk bond status in January 2007 when it clambered above S amp;Ps speculative grade rating of BB+.         
	A rating downgrade will not hurt the government since it doesnt go in for commercial borrowings overseas but it will hurt firms who plan to raise foreign loans. It could also impact funds inflow from foreign institutional investors.        
	The global rating agency said the latest outlook revision reflected its view that Indias fiscal position had deteriorated to a level that was unsustainable in the medium term.        
	We expect general government deficit, including off-budget measures such as oil and fertiliser bonds, to increase to 11.4 per cent in the fiscal year ending March 31, 2009, from 5.7 per cent in the previous fiscal year, S amp;Ps credit analyst Takahira Ogawa said today.        
	The government has implemented various policies that increase stress on its fiscal position ahead of the general election, which is likely to be held in May, he added.         
	These policies include debt relief for farmers and a pay hike for government employees  the first in 11 years.        
	We expect the deficit to remain high at 11.1 per cent in 2009-2010. The deficit could widen if the next government implements another stimulus package, Ogawa said.        
	Though Indias medium-term growth prospects were strong, S amp;P felt fiscal consolidation could be delayed because of the uncertain near-term economic conditions.        
	The rating agency noted that with high government debt burden and deficits, its weak fiscal profile has been the single largest negative factor for the sovereign ratings.        
	Among the mitigating factors, leading to Indias upgrade to BBB- rating in January 2007, was the commitment to fiscal consolidation by various levels of the government in the country.        
	S amp;P said the fiscal slippage highlighted in the governments interim budget announced on February 16, reversed the consolidation trend and called into question such a commitment.        
	However, Indias external position is expected to remain resilient.

	New Delhi, Feb. 12: Inflation fell to 4.39 per cent for the week ended January 31 on the back of cheaper fuel, food and liquor.        
	Based on the wholesale price index, inflation was 5.07 per cent a week ago, and the declining trend has raised expectations of a rate cut by the RBI.        
	On January 28, the government reduced the price of petrol by Rs 5 a litre, diesel by Rs 2 and domestic LPG by Rs 25 per cylinder.        
	Prices of the fuel items in the inflation basket fell 3.1 per cent, while liquor was cheaper by 15 per cent. Fruit and vegetable prices fell 3 per cent and tea, 1 per cent.

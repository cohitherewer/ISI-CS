The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | UB offloads stake to cut debt load
                                                                                                               UB offloads stake to cut debt load
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Mumbai, June 30: The UB group has raised Rs 905 crore by selling its treasury shares in United Spirits (USL) in an attempt to reduce the debt on its books.        
	The transaction was routed through Shaw Wallace amp; Company, the Calcutta-based liquor company that Vijay Mallyas UB Group acquired in 2005. Shaw Wallace is in the process of being merged into the groups flagship USL.        
	On Tuesday, Shaw Wallace sold 10.28 million treasury shares that it held in USL at around Rs 880 per share. The treasury stocks were created as a result of a merger plan.         
	The buyers of the USL shares were T. Rowe Price, Capital International Emerging Markets Fund, DWS Investment, Emerging Markets Growth Fund and Reliance Mutual Fund. The transactions were done through block deals. There could be a few other buyers because the transactions reported on the BSE website did not add up to 10.28 million.               
	USL sees the treasury stock sale as a major step to deleverage its balance sheet, which is laden with debts worth Rs 7,500 crore.         
	With this (sale of treasury stock) and accelerated payments already made, the company would have repaid about half of the original loan. In the process, the company will save an estimated Rs 85 crore per annum in interest costs, Nedungadi said.        
	Sources said USL was still keen to pursue the qualified institutional placement route to raise another $250-300 million or engage a private equity investor to reduce debt further. USL continues to be in talks with Diageo, the worlds largest drinks company, to offload an equity stake to the latter, sources said. If this transaction does indeed materialise, USL will be better placed to dealeverage its balance sheet.        
	USL has various other options to raise additional cash, including a choice of sale of balance treasury shares (8.35 million), QIP, GDR, and placement with private equity funds to raise further equity for additional de-leveraging. USL now has the luxury of doing a strategic transaction with the best possible partner without liquidity pressure, added Nedungadi.

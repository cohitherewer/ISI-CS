                                                                                                               SEZ exit tied to sop refund
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Stumbling block                                  
	New Delhi, May 22: The government is willing to denotify special economic zones provided the developer refunds the duty-free benefits.         
	The Board of Approval, the highest decision making body on SEZs, would be meeting on June 2 to take a call on the issue.         
	Real estate developer DLF wants to surrender four SEZs in Bhubaneswar, Gandhinagar, Calcutta and Sonepat because of the economic slowdown and liquidity crunch in industry. The realty firm had earlier wanted to surrender its IT special economic zone in Delhi.        
	Officials said developers legally could not surrender SEZs once they became operational. DLF, however, has not started work on the five SEZs that it wants to surrender.        
	They said the government had notified nine IT SEZs of DLF, of which the company planned to drop five.        
	According to official data, the land banks of DLFs four notified SEZs are: 10.12 hectares in Gandhinagar, 10.24 hectares in Sonepat, 10.23 hectares in Bhubaneswar and 10.48 hectares in Calcutta.        
	The global economic downturn and the slowdown in the IT sector have affected demand for office space, so the realty firm has approached the government for denotification, sources said.        
	L.B. Singhal, director-general of the Export Promotion Council on EoUs and SEZs said, We should not have any issue in denotification. If the SEZ developer is willing to refund the entire duty-free benefits to the government.        
	The government has given its approval to 568 SEZs and has notified 315 of them. Exports last fiscal from SEZs stood at Rs 90,316 crore against a target of Rs 1,25,000 crore.        
	Goa case        
	The final word is yet to be heard on the three SEZs denotified by the Goa government. Meditab Specialities pharma SEZ at Keri, K Rahejas IT SEZ at Verna and Peninsula Pharmas biotech SEZ at Sancoale are yet to be denotified as the developers have moved the courts challenging the state governments move.

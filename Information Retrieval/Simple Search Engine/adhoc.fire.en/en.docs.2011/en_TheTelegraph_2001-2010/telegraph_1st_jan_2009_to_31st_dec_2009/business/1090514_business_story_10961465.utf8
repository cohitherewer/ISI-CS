The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Ficci lobbies for lower tax rates
                                                                                                               Ficci lobbies for lower tax rates
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, May 13: Industry association Ficci today sought a cut in personal income tax and other tax sops in its pre-budget meeting with revenue secretary P.V. Bhide. This will boost consumer spending and help the economy to recover from the ongoing slowdown.        
	In the meeting, Ficci president Harshpati Singhania pressed for a reduction in personal income and corporate taxes to 25 per cent to revive industry which witnessed a 2.3 per cent contraction in March.         
	The maximum rate of income tax is now 30 per cent for income above Rs 5 lakh. Ficci wants the threshold to be raised to Rs 10 lakh.        
	Others in the Ficci team included Rajan Bharti Mittal, vice-chairman and managing director of Bharti Enterprises, and SAIL chief S.K. Roongta.        
	Singhania, however, later admitted that there was little headroom for sops. This year, there is a particularly difficult situation with revenue deficit being there. I think the government has a limited scope for doing things, hesaid.        
	The new government is likely to be in place by this month and will present the budget for 2009-10 in the first session of the 15th Lok Sabha. The outgoing Congress-led UPA government had tabled an interim budget in February and sought Parliaments approval to draw money from the Consolidated Fund of India to meet the expenditures till July.         
	The associations other demands included providing incentives for investment in agriculture and the continuation of tax benefits in housing, telecom and power.         
	Ficci has also demanded an investment allowance and the restoration of annual depreciation rate of 25 per cent on machinery. The new government should continue levying excise duty at 8 per cent and service tax at 10 per cent till the next fiscal, Singhania said.

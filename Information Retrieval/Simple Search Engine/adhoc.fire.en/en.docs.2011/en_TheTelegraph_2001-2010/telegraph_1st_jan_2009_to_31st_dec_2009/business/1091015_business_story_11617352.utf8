          OUR BUREAU                          The new Indigo Manza unveiled in Mumbai on Wednesday. (PTI)                                  
	Mumbai, Oct. 14: Tata Motors has increased the production of the Nano by 20 per cent from this month at its Pantnagar facility. The move is aimed at quickly clearing the backlog of its popular small car.         
	We are gearing up for a higher number. We are ramping up our production capacity by 20 per cent from this month. After the increase, sales will be more than 3,000 vehicles per month, Rajiv Dube, president (passenger cars) of Tata Motors, said.        
	He said the company averaged around 2,500 Nanos during the last three months.        
	Tata Motors had sold 2,524 Nanos last month, while the total sales of its passenger vehicles stood at 20,743, a 23 per cent rise over the year-ago period.         
	The company today launched the Indigo Manza, priced between Rs 4.8 lakh and Rs 6.75 lakh (ex-showroom Delhi).        
	Tata Motors hopes to reclaim pole position in the mid-size segment with the new generation sedan. The Indigo Manza will replace the Indigo, which was launched in January 2003. However, other models built on the Indigo platform  the Indigo CS, Indigo Marina and Indigo XL  will continue to be sold.        
	Tata Motors said the car had been designed to offer more comfort to the driver and passengers than any other car in the same category.        
	Apart from spacious rear seats with a central armrest, the car is equipped with electronically adjustable and controlled outer rear view mirrors.         
	The driver information system on top of the central console provides information on fuel consumption and ambient temperature. The tilt adjustable power steering with a height adjustable driver seat allows a comfortable driving posture.        
	The safety features of the Indigo Manza include an anti-lock braking system and dual frontal airbags. The car comes with 90 hp Quadrajet diesel and Safire petrol engines sourced from Fiat.        
	Dube said the Indigo Manza would be the eighth model launched in the domestic market over the last two years by Tata Motors and Fiat, with whom it had an alliance.

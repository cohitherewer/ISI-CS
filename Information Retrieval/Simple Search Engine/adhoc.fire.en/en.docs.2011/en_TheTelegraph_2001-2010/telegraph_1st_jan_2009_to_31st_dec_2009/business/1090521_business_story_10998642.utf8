The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Faint hint of budget delay
                                                                                                               Faint hint of budget delay
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Chawla: Weighing options                                  
	New Delhi, May 20: The new government has to prepare and pass a budget by July-end but can, if it so chooses, get a vote-on-account passed and delay the budget, finance secretary Ashok Chawla said here today.        
	What is very clear is that the interim budget will be operational till the end of July. So, the government has the ability to carry on expenditure till then. If it is not possible to pass the full budget by August 1, we will need a vote-on-account for another short period beyond that, Chawla said.        
	However, officials said that work on a new stimulus package was already underway and it would take about 6-8 weeks to prepare a new budget. This seems doable, said other officials.         
	The outgoing UPA government had presented a vote-on-account before the election enabling government spending till July. When it came to power in 2004, it had presented and passed a full budget by July-end.         
	The swearing-in ceremony for the formation of the new government will be held on Friday. The first session of the Lok Sabha may take place on June 2, and it is expected to continue with the presentation of the budget and its passing.        
	The Congress manifesto has promised to present the full budget within 45 days of forming the new government, with the basic objective of returning to the path of faster and more inclusive growth.         
	The finance ministry has already done some of the spadework. It has met the industry associations  CII, Ficci and Assocham  who have presented their wish lists that include removing the fringe benefit tax and the surcharge on corporate tax, tax incentives for investment and raising the income tax exemption limit.        
	Chawla said credit would be available for infrastructure and expressed the hope that banks, both public and private, would bring down their lending rates following the cuts in key policy rates by the Reserve Bank of India.        
	Anil meets Montek        
	Industrialist Anil Ambani today met Planning Commission deputy chairman Montek Singh Ahluwalia, who is reportedly in the reckoning for the post of finance minister.         
	Ambani, who met Ahluwalia at his office in the Yojana Bhawan here, refused to take questions about the meeting.        
	Ahluwalias office, when contacted, said it was just a courtesy call.

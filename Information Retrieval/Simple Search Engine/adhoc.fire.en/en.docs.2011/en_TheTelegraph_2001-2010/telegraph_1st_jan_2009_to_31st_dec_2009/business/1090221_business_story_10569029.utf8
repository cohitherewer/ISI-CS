	Calcutta, Feb. 20: The State Bank of India will be the sole booking agent for Tata Motors Nano, according to Jayanta Kumar Sinha, chief general manager of the bank, Bengal circle.         
	He, however, declined to give the details of the arrangement. Sinha said a formal announcement would be made in a few days.         
	Initially, the SBI will distribute the prospectus in 100 select branches. The booking is expected to start by the end of this month and the initial amount will be Rs 70,000 per car. The allotment of the first 100 cars will be made through a lucky draw.         
	Tata Motors is expected to produce 3,000 cars a month in the beginning, while it will accept orders for one lakh cars.         
	The advantage of the SBI being the sole booking agent is that a large number of buyers may become a car loan borrower. We also create a huge database of customers to whom we can cross-sell some of our products later, said a senior official of the bank.        
	The SBI will also offer car loans at an interest of 10 per cent. This offer is valid till May 31 this year.        
	The bank is also offering an 8 per cent interest  fixed for one year  on home loans till April 30. So far, we have received 1,500 applications involving a disbursement of around Rs 15 crore, Sinha said.         
	Around 25-30 per cent of these applications are for loan takeovers (home loan borrowers of other banks switching to SBI), he said.        
	Indias No. 1 bank has tied up with realtors Ambuja Realty, Calcutta Riverside and Eden City. The developers will pay the bank the pre-EMI interest on behalf of their customers.

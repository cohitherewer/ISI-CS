The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Companies bill set to get more edge
                                                                                                               Companies bill set to get more edge
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Aug. 3: The Congress-led government today reintroduced the companies bill in Parliament, working in clauses on mergers and acquisitions and class action lawsuits by investors against fraudulent firms.        
	The bill, introduced in the Lok Sabha today by corporate affairs minister Salman Khurshid, also provides for more effective inspection and investigation of companies and stiffer penalties.        
	The bills introduction comes in the wake of the Rs 7,000-crore Satyam fraud. The government, which was working on a revamp of the act, had then vowed to curb corporate scams.         
	Shareholders associations or group of shareholders should be able to take legal action in case of any fraudulent action on the part of the company and to take part in investor protection activities and class action suits, the bill said.        
	The bill seeks to make insider trading by company directors a criminal offence. In the Satyam case, it was alleged that the promoters had inflated profit figures to jack up share prices for huge personal gains.         
	The new bill aims to strengthen corporate governance and makes it mandatory for independent directors to comprise at least one-third of the board.        
	It also facilitates joint ventures and relaxes restrictions on the number of partners in entities such as partnership firms and banks.        
	The bill provides for a new corporate entity in the form of a one-person company.         
	It gives powers to the government to bring a simpler compliance regime for small companies.        
	Earlier last year, the Companies Bill, 2008 was introduced in the Lok Sabha.         
	However, with the Lok Sabha getting dissolved before it was passed, the bill lapsed and had to be reintroduced.        
	The new bill has a single comprehensive legal framework that will govern everything corporate  from incorporation to liquidation and winding up  and will be administered by the central government.         
	The bill also harmonises the company law framework with the rules governing different industries.

	Calcutta, Sept. 4: India Infrastructure Finance Company Ltd (IIFCL) will launch a lending scheme in three months to enable special purpose vehicles (SPVs) in infrastructure to raise funds from the domestic as well as the overseas markets.        
	On offer is a credit enhancement product, which is a co-finance scheme where a principal lender such as IIFCL ties up with one or more lenders to give more credit to borrowers. The principal lender acts as a guarantor of the pooled finance.        
	Icra is developing a credit-wrap insurance product to help infrastructure SPVs, who are without a rating history, which face difficulties in raising resources from the long-term debt market, IIFCL chairman S.S. Kohli told reporters on the sidelines of a seminar organised by the CII here today.        
	Under the scheme, IIFCL will provide the guarantee in India, while its UK subsidiary, IIFCL (UK) Ltd, will be the guarantor for overseas borrowings.         
	IIFCL sought request for proposals (bids) from credit rating agencies for the scheme in July this year, and Icra was selected to develop the product.         
	Availability of credit enhancement to such infrastructure projects will go a long way in mitigating their fund requirement, Kohli said.        
	Icra will develop the product on the basis of the best infrastructure financing practices, including reinsurance options.        
	Infrastructure investment in the Eleventh Five-Year Plan (2007-12) has been estimated at $514 billion.         
	But, given the economic crisis, the target is unlikely to be met, Kohli said, adding that there could be a shortfall of $100-$115 billion.         
	Even if we get a $400-billion investment in infrastructure during the current plan period, it will be more than 200 per cent higher than what we did in the last five year plan, he said.        
	Since its inception in 2006, IIFCL has received proposals from 225 infrastructure projects.         
	Out of these, we sanctioned 111 projects at a total project cost of Rs 1,60,000 crore; others didnt meet our lending criteria, Kohli said.         
	Of these 111 projects, 62 are highway plans, 22 power, 6 port and 2 airport.

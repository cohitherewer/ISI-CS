	New Delhi, May 7: Hyundai Motor India Ltd plans to roll out another variant of the Santro by the end of this year.        
	The Santro has been a very successful car for us. We may refresh the car by the year end, said a senior Hyundai official.         
	Earlier in 2003, the Korean firm had launched the Santro Xing, albeit with cosmetic changes.         
	Two years later, the Santro got the eRLX technology. The CNG variant was introduced in 2007, and the LNG version in 2008.         
	According to sources, there will be some stylistic changes, but the price of the new variant may not vary much.         
	Of course there will be some tweaking done in the overall appearance of the car, but no engine change is on the cards, sources said.         
	At present, the Santro is available in three variants petrol, LPG and CNG  and is priced between Rs 2,59,900 and Rs 3,69,059 (ex-showroom, Delhi).         
	Hyundai exports the car to Columbia, Mexico, Sudan, South Africa and Algeria. Till April, the company has exported 4,39,541 units. Since its launch in India in September 1998, Hyundai has sold 9,84,418 units in the domestic market.         
	The Santro and the i10 constitute nearly 75 per cent of the 22,000-23,000 units that Hyundai sells each month in the domestic market.         
	No break-up was available for Santro and i10 sales. Officials, however, said i10 sales were higher.        
	In April, Hyundai sold 44,371 cars against 40,000 a year ago. Within the country, the sales were higher at 22,247 units against 21,501 a year ago, while exports stood at 22,124 units against 18,499 units.        
	Hyundai expects sales in India to grow up to five per cent this year with the diesel and LPG variants of the i20 and the Accent lined up for a launch.         
	It has joined hands with the Union Bank of India to provide retail finance to customers.         
	We want to retain our market share, for which our sales have to grow according to the industry growth. Industry has been projected to grow 3-5 per cent and we will also grow by the same rate, said Arvind Saxena, senior vice-president (marketing and sales), Hyundai Motors India Ltd.         
	The company enjoyed a 20.4 per cent share in the domestic passenger car segment, which recorded sales of 12,19,473 units in 2008.        
	Strike called off        
	Hyundai said the 18-day-old strike by workers at its Chennai plant had been called off with immediate effect and normal production would resume from tomorrow.         
	The company will take back 20 out of 75 suspended workers, corporate communications head Rajiv Mitra said.

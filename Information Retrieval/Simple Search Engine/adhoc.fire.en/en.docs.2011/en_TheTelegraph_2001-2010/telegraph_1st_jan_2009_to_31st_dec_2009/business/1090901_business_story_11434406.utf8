  Poor rain remains an irritant          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                                  
	New Delhi, Aug. 31: The economy fed on government spending to log a 6.1 per cent growth rate in April-June 2009  its first acceleration, or a higher quarter-on-quarter growth, since December 2007  but poor rain is threatening to spoil the future outlook.        
	After the strong show, India is the second fastest growing economy among major countries after China, which recorded a 7.9 per cent growth in the April-June quarter.        
	I am glad that the worst may be over, and we expect to see improved performance in subsequent quarters. It (GDP numbers) is very good and is consistent with what we were hoping for, Montek Singh Ahluwalia, deputy chairman of the Planning Commission, said.        
	However, the poor rain has made observers cautious about the future, with a Planning Commission note saying a severe drought can even push back growth to 5.5 per cent in 2009-2010. In the worst-case scenario of farm sector GDP declining by 6 per cent, overall GDP could be limited to 5.5 per cent, the note said.        
	If the damage to agriculture is limited, as expected, the growth will slip to 6.3 per cent from 6.7 per cent in 2008-09. The lowest estimate of foodgrain production for this fiscal is 205 million tonnes, a decline of 29 million tonnes, or 12 per cent.        
	Agriculture in the first quarter of 2008-09 fell to 2.4 per cent compared with 3 per cent a year ago, but a strong show by mining, financial services and electricity helped the economy to grow 6.1 per cent, according to the Central Statistical Organisation.        
	At 6.1 per cent, growth was higher than the previous quarters 5.76 per cent but much lower than the 7.8 per cent recorded in the first quarter of 2008-09.        
	While mining grew 7.9 per cent, financial services and electricity grew 8.1 per cent and 6.2 per cent, respectively.        
	Overall, there have been signs of a turnaround in manufacturing, which grew 3.4 per cent during the quarter after contracting 1.4 per cent in the previous quarter. Output is still weaker than the June quarter of last year, when manufacturing grew 5.5 per cent.        
	The worst hit were trade, hotels, transport amp; communication, which grew 8.1 per cent compared with 13 per cent a year ago.        
	Government spending grew to 9.9 per cent of the gross domestic product (GDP) during the quarter, up from 9.6 per cent during the same period last year, while exports shrank from 26.5 per cent to 22.3 per cent of GDP.        
	Gross fixed capital formation, a measure of investment which is crucial for sustainable recovery, was 31.6 per cent of GDP for the quarter down from 32.2 per cent in the same quarter last year.        
	In 2008-09, the economy grew 6.7 per cent, its weakest in six years and well below the rates of 9 per cent or more in the previous three years. The Reserve Bank of India is forecasting 6 per cent growth for the current fiscal year but has stated that the target can be exceeded.        
	Government spending has held up demand. This was a period when elections were held, and this also would have supported demand, D.K. Joshi, principal economist at rating agency Crisil, said.        
	The worst in terms of the external-led downturn is over. What is more of a threat now is domestic concerns, coming from the drought, Sherman Chan, an economist at Moodys Economy.com said.

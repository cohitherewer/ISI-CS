                                                                                                               Andhra in chemical hub pact

	Oct. 1: Andhra Pradesh today became the first state to sign a memorandum of understanding (MoU) with the Centre for a petrochemical hub in the state.         
	Bengal, which has received approval for a similar project covering Nayachar and Haldia, hopes to ink the deal soon.        
	The petroleum, chemical and petrochemical investment region (PCPIR) between Visakhapatnam and Kakinada will attract global investments worth Rs 3 lakh crore and provide 12 lakh jobs.         
	The Centre will provide Rs 6,334 crore to the project to develop infrastructure, while the state will contribute Rs 2,132 crore.         
	The Centres share in the Bengal hub would be much less as the chosen site has a well developed infrastructure.         
	Bengal had received the cabinet nod earlier this year. The next stage is the signing of a formal agreement with the Centre, clearly defining the role each party is expected to play, including the investment.        
	I am expecting it to happen within this month, Nandini Chakravorty, executive director of the West Bengal Industrial Development Corporation, said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Satyam works on bid criteria
                                                                                                               Satyam works on bid criteria
                            
	New Delhi, Feb. 8 (PTI): The board of Satyam Computer Services will soon define the process for inviting proposals from prospective buyers, its newly appointed chairman Kiran Karnik said.        
	Our investment bankers  Goldman Sachs and Avendus  will shortly define the process of inviting proposals from the suitors, which will be transparent and investor-friendly. Only after that we will be in a position to look into whether the proposals are meeting our criteria, the former Nasscom president said.        
	Karnik said there had to be a smooth and tranparent transition from a government-supervised company to a professionally-run one.         
	That would give a lot of comfort to both investors and employees. It is a key priority, Karnik said        
	A number of buyers have sent in their proposals, while other are waiting for a formal process to begin.         
	Karnik said Deloitte and KPMG were restating Satyams accounts and it was difficult to ascertain the time they would take.         
	The auditors have to go back several years to see where the funds came from, and since when they were being diverted. Thats not an easy task and is likely to take time, he said. The man who guided the Indian IT industry through the outsourcing backlash in the US said there were short and long-term challenges for the fund-starved company.

          OUR CORRESPONDENT                                            
	New Delhi, Nov. 16: French tyre major Michelin will set up a facility to manufacture truck and bus radials in Tamil Nadu at an investment of Rs 4,000 crore.        
	This is Michelins first plant in India. It now imports all the tyres.        
	The proposed facility, spread over 290 acres, is at Thervoy Kandigai near Chennai and will employ about 1,500 workers from the locality, the company said in a statement.        
	The Michelin group and the Tamil Nadu government signed a memorandum of understanding today.        
	Michelin is extremely grateful to Tamil Nadu for making it possible (for us) to have access to land and infrastructure to build our factory, said Prashant Prabhu, president (Africa-India-West Asia), after exchanging documents with chief minister M. Karunanidhi and state government officials in Chennai.        
	India holds tremendous potential for the Michelin group in terms of establishing a world class manufacturing facility, he said.        
	The plant, which would start its operations in 2012, would produce a range of truck and bus radial tyres. However, the company did not reveal the proposed production capacity of the plant.        
	Prabhu said the plant would focus on the domestic market.        
	Earlier in July, the government had cleared a Rs 11,000-crore foreign direct investment proposal of Michelin to set up a manufacturing facility in Tamil Nadu.        
	According to the approval, the company plans to invest Rs 4,000 crore over a period of seven years.         
	After the completion of the seven years, depending on the progress of the project and demand for tyres, the company would invest another Rs 7,000 crore over a period of three years.        
	Michelin is one of the worlds largest tyre manufacturers, operating 69 factories across 19 countries with a capacity to roll out 190 million tyres per annum.

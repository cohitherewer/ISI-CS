	Mutual discontent
  dhirendra kumar        
	At one point in his budget speech today, the finance minister pointed out with some pride that this was the first budget in which the expenditure had crossed Rs 10 lakh crore. He also pointed out that the first budget of independent India had an expenditure of Rs 193 crore. Rs 10 lakh crore is a very large number, and it has no less than 13 zeros in it.         
	However, it is disproportionately larger than Rs 192 crore. From 1947 till now, the countrys economy has grown at perhaps 7 per cent a year while government expenditure has grown at about 50 per cent a year. This is an amazing differential. I guess there are many reasons and explanations for this differential, but its still a powerful pointer to how much bigger the government has become in relation to the economy.         
	Meanwhile, by the afternoon of budget day, the budget itself has become hostage to the stock markets terrible verdict on it, at least in the business media and in the mind of investors. The direction of this reaction is justifiable, though not its severity.         
	Still, it is true that the budget falls short on many counts. The deficit is even larger than the already enlarged expectations. Theres no definite direction or road map on anything that can be called reforms. Theres no meaningful tax relief for corporate houses, in fact theres a tax hike in the form of higher MAT.         
	In my opinion, the severity of the stock markets verdict has more to do with a bounce-back from unreasonable expectations and over-inflated stock prices. It wouldnt be a surprise to see a bounce-back from this slump within days.         
	However, the most important question to be asked today is, what does this budget tell us about the governments reform credentials and its intentions.         
	Are the expectations built up in the post-election honeymoon justified? Im sorry to say that Im not sure whether the government has proven these credentials today.         
	The worst case conclusion that one can draw from this budget is that this is a government that will tax a lot and then spend a lot on social schemes with leaky delivery without doing anything to plug those leakages.         
	Meanwhile, if it has less money than it needs then it will happily run up as big a deficit as it pleases, without even thinking of making the useless parts of government smaller.         
	Thats just a caricature of this budget but I have a hunch that like most caricatures, it has an element of truth in it. Part of what has spooked the investment community is this unarticulated fear that the country has a back-to-the-seventies scenario on its hand. To be sure, thats an exaggeration and we live in a very different world today, but it is entirely possible that this government will walk on the left edge of the path available to it.         
	And thats not a comfortable idea.

	Small is not so beautiful 
  Anil chopra        
	Small saving schemes or post office schemes are hugely popular in our country as a medium for parking or saving ones surplus funds. Particularly, these schemes are the darlings of millions of senior citizens spread across the length and breadth of the country due to sovereign safety and attractive interest rates.         
	Investments in schemes like National Saving Certificates and Public Provident Fund also qualify for tax benefit under Section 80C within the overall limit of Rs1 lakh per individual.         
	There were hopes and expectations that the rate of interests being offered on small saving schemes could be tinkered with in the budget provisions or the tax benefits attached to some of these schemes may be modified or withdrawn.         
	However, nothing of this sort has been announced in the budget and this may have come as a relief to those expecting a cut in the interest rates and as a disappointment to those who were expecting an increase in Section 80C limit from Rs 1 lakh to Rs 1.5 lakh or even Rs 2 lakh.        
	 There have been suggestions to link the interest rates being offered on various small saving schemes, including Kisan Vikas Patra (KVP) and Post Office Monthly Income Scheme (POMIS), to market movements of interest rates or 10-year government securities yield.         
	However, in my opinion, this suggestion does not merit consideration as interest rates are quite volatile and it may not be feasible to change interest rates being offered on small saving schemes so frequently.         
	Budget, on the whole, has not recommended any far reaching amendments except giving marginal relief to taxpayers ranging from Rs 1,000 per year for ordinary citizens to Rs 1,500 for senior citizens.         
	Surcharge has been abolished. However, this will benefit only those whose annual income is above Rs 10 lakh.         
	Post Office savings schemes offer mental satisfaction of assured returns and fulfil an important requirement of risk averse citizens seeking safety of capital and/or regular returns.

	Twist in the tax tale
  Subhash lakhotia        
	In the sphere of personal finance, Budget 2009 -2010 provides for meagre tax concessions, which will reduce a small burden of a large number of individual taxpayers of India. But the fact remains that surely the tax burden will be reduced for all categories of taxpayers whether they are individual men or women or senior citizens.         
	 The basic income tax exemption for individual taxpayers during the financial year 2009 - 2010 would now be Rs 1,60 000, while the same would be Rs 1,90,000 for women tax payers and Rs 2,40,000 for the senior citizens.         
	The impact on tax savings due to this amendment is that both individual men and women would now be able to save income tax ranging from Rs 1,000 to Rs 3,000 depending upon their income scale. However, the highest savings would be for senior citizens, which would be in the range of Rs 1,500 to Rs 4,500.         
	The 10 per cent surcharge, which for individual taxpayers is applicable on income in excess of Rs 10 lakh, has completely been scrapped as a result of the Budget proposal. There would be tax deduction to individual taxpayers to the extent of 3 per cent of their income, especially in case the income exceeds Rs 10 lakh per annum.         
	With reference to deduction under section 80 E of the Income Tax Act, at present the law provides for deduction in respect of specific higher education but now the Budget proposes to extend this deduction to any course of study pursued after passing the senior secondary examination or its equivalent from any School, Board or University recognised by the Central or state government.         
	The deduction in respect of maintenance of dependant person with severe disability has been increased to Rs 1,00, 000. However, there is no change in the limit for non-severe disability dependant.         
	From the financial year 2010 -2011, a special provision is being proposed for individuals, Hindu undivided family and partnership firms for computing profits and gains of business on presumptive basis, which will be calculated 8 per cent of total turnover or gross receipts. This would be applicable where the total turnover or gross receipts does not exceed Rs 40 lakh.         
	 Partnership firms would now be able to pay higher amount to the partners on account of salary, bonus, commission or remuneration. The new revised limits for deduction for all categories of partnership firms for this purpose would be Rs 1, 50,000 or at the rate of 90 per cent of income on the first Rs 3,00, 000 of the firms income and 60 per cent on the balance book profit.         
	The taxpayers should now be very careful with regard to new tax provisions introduced in the finance bill whereby deemed capital gains liability would also arise in respect of property transactions entered with power of attorney or agreement to sale transaction. Likewise, the taxpayers should also note that the provisions of tax liability on gift received from non-relatives is also applicable to property transactions, namely immovable properties and other property as well.         
	Now no advance tax is required to be paid if the advance tax payable is up to Rs 10, 000. The income tax return form no. 2 is proposed to be made Saral. The wealth tax exemption limit has been hiked to Rs 30 lakhs.

	Insurance gap 
  Nilanjan dey        
	In a budget that does not offer a lot of sops to the countrys savers and investors, the finance minister has nearly sidestepped the insurance sector, the latters potential to generate serious, long-term resources notwithstanding.        
	The budget has little for Section 80C of the I-T Act, the section that forms the very basis for tax-saving instruments. Insurance has been over the years a critical element here, qualifying perfectly for deductions under this all-important provision.        
	Further, scant attention has been paid to medical insurance, another issue that policy-makers in India need to address urgently.         
	In a scenario marked by escalating healthcare expenses, such slackness is not quite welcome.         
	Also, there is not much on rural insurance, a segment that has enormous potential, especially so because quality healthcare is nearly non-existent in rural India. The same holds for micro insurance as well.        
	At a time when the government is championing the new pension scheme (NPS)  yes, just look at the kind of support being given to it by the finance minister  a firmer stance on insurance could have helped ordinary Indians. Pension and insurance are two of the principal suppliers of long-term capital everywhere.        
	We must, however, mention here that the budget has aimed at pushing rural growth. This should, over a period of time, have a healthy consequence for savings and investments in rural areas.         
	Rural India is anyway the next big destination for insurers. Incidentally, the finance minister has clearly said that financial inclusion is vital for sustaining long-term equitable development. And you cannot be financially included if you are uninsured.        
	So, is the budget (which has indicated that insurance and banks will stay with the public sector) completely devoid of good tidings?         
	No, the decision to provide certain benefits to the individual tax-payer may yet emerge as a small but positive measure for insurance. The good news takes the shape of an increase in the basic exemption limit. This, at the end of the day, may help individuals devote a little more to risk management products.        
	While the actual increase, Rs 10,000 in the case of both men and women (assuming they are not senior citizens), may sound as too insignificant in todays context, the budgetary provision may prompt ordinary people to take one more step towards covering their life risk.        
	In a country where people are mostly under-insured, every little contribution will go a long way. Added to this is the other minor but purposeful step: removal of 10 per cent surcharge on personal income-tax. Both will provide relief to individual tax-payers.        
	The budget, mind you, is said to be revenue-neutral; it will not lead to a revenue loss. In this backdrop, the new exemption limits are: Rs 1.60 lakh and Rs 1.90 lakh per annum for men and women, respectively. A senior citizen will not have to pay tax up to an annual income of Rs 2.40 lakh.        
	On another front, this could have been the finance ministers chance to clearly spell out the governments stance on increasing the FDI limit (to 49 per cent from 26 per cent) and insurance sector divestment. It is widely acknowledged that higher FDI should lead to all-round growth of the industry.

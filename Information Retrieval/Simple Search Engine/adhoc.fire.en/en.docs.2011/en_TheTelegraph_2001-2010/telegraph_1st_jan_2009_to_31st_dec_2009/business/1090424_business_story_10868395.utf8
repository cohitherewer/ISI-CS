The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Sebi turns heat on Pyramid promoter
                                                                                                               Sebi turns heat on Pyramid promoter
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Mumbai, April 23: In one of the harshest crackdowns on security fraud in recent times, the Securities and Exchange Board of India today barred Pyramid Saimira Theatre (PSTL) promoter Nirmal N. Kotecha and 227 persons and entities from trading in the markets until further orders.         
	Kotecha stands accused of issuing a forged letter in the name of the market regulator in December 2008 to Pyramid Saimiras chairman and managing director P.S. Saminathan, directing him to come out with an open offer for 20 per cent of the stock at a price not less than Rs 250 a share.        
	At that time, the Pyramid stock was ruling at Rs 64.80 on the Bombay Stock Exchange.        
	The fraudulent letter was designed to artificially inflate the price of the floundering Pyramid Saimira stock and create an exit route for Kotecha who held just over 12 per cent in the company.        
	Sebi barred the other 227 persons and entities from trading in the markets for facilitating Nirmal Kotecha in carrying out suspicious banking transactions, carrying out and disguising his manipulative intent.        
	The regulator also directed Saminathan not to access or buy, sell or deal in the securities market, including in initial public offerings, either directly or indirectly, till further directions for making misleading public announcements, only to create public interest in the scrip of PSTL, for facilitating Nirmal Kotecha in offloading his shares in PSTL at an artificially inflated price in the market.        
	In an interim order, Sebi said Nirmal Kotecha had planned and executed the forgery as a means to drive up the PSTL price and to derive unlawful profit, whether directly or indirectly before the forgery came to light.

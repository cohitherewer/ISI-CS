	New Delhi, June 17: Fiat, which has recently entered into an alliance with Chrysler of the US, may roll out the models of the American car manufacturer in India.         
	When asked whether the Italian auto maker would bring the Chrysler brands to India, Silverio Bonfiglioli, chief operating officer (international operations) of Fiat Group Automobiles, said why not. He refused to give any details about the models.        
	Chryslers major car brands are the Avenger, Caliber, Challenger and the Viper. In trucks, the well known ones are the Dakota and the Sprinter. The US company also has a significant presence in the mini van section with brands such as the Nitro, Durango and the Grand Caravan.        
	The alliance with Fiat helped Chrysler to come out of bankruptcy last week. As part of the alliance, Fiat will have a 20 per cent equity stake in Chrysler in return for technology to make small cars.        
	The two firms have finalised a global strategic alliance to form a new Chrysler that has the resources, technology and worldwide distribution network required to compete effectively on a global scale.        
	Fiat, which launched its premium hatchback Grande Punto today, is looking to capture a bigger share of the rapidly growing Indian market.        
	The company has priced the car between Rs 3.99 lakh and Rs 6.11 lakh. The hatchback has been launched with two petrol and one diesel variants.         
	The petrol models will cost Rs 3.99-5.61 lakh, while the diesel cars will be offered at Rs 4.85-6.11 lakh. Fiat expects to sell 2,000-2,500 units of the car per month.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | M amp;M consolidation drive
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      M amp;M consolidation drive
          OUR BUREAU PTI                          Luthra: Rejig mode                                  
	Mumbai, Dec. 8: Mahindra amp; Mahindra (M amp;M) today said it would consolidate its auto component businesses under one roof and expand the aerospace component business. The aim in aerospace is to earn $150 million a year after five years.        
	The consolidation in the auto component business is required because it will be much more cost-effective to sell products under one brand rather than sending five account managers for selling five products from the same group, M amp;M president (Systech Sector) Hemant Luthra said.        
	The auto component business has three listed firms, Mahindra Ugines, Mahindra Composites and Mahindra Forgings, and three unlisted ones  Mahindra Systech, Mahindra Gears and Mahindra Castings. Systech Sector has also acquired at least 10 firms since its inception four years back for around 250 million euros. Declining to give any time frame for the consolidation, Luthra said, If we can bring in all these people together, we will be able to do it. We will also have to get approval from Sebi.        
	We have not started anything other than the intellectual exercise, but hope it will happen in less than two years.         
	He said after consolidation, M amp;M would hold between 55 per cent and 65 per cent in the new entity, which might bear the Systech name. Financial institutions hold sizeable stakes in the listed entities of M amp;Ms auto parts business. This might prompt M amp;M to list the proposed entity. Will it be listed on day one? I doubt it. Players such as ICICI, which has investment in the forging business, would like to get it listed, he said.        
	In aerospace, Luthra said the company was putting up a greenfield facility in Bangalore at an investment of $10 million and negotiating with an Australian aero-component making firm for a joint venture or an acquisition.         
	We already have an existing company in the aerospace business. We see a huge opportunity in the sector, he said.

                                                                                                               Sweet tidings at sugar meet
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Sharad Pawar in New Delhi on Monday. (PTI)                                  
	New Delhi, Aug. 17: The government and the sugar industry today discussed measures to improve the supply of the sweetener during the Pujas even as the heavy rain over the last three-four days has diminished the spectre of a severe shortage.         
	I can tell you that the industrys attitude was quite constructive. They would like to co-operate (with) the government and (are) ready to find some solution where we will be able to improve availability in the open market and in the public distribution system, agriculture minister Sharad Pawar said after the meeting.        
	Officials said the government was also planning a bonus on the statutory minimum support price of Rs 107.76 a quintal for sugarcane for the 2009-10 crushing season (October-September).        
	At present, mills are mandated to provide 10 per cent of their production to the government, which supplies the sweetener through ration shops at cheaper rates. Prices of sugar have surged due to a decline in output.        
	With the Pujas just weeks away, the government is concerned that prices could spike further. Prices have crossed Rs 30 a kg in the retail market from Rs 17-18 a year ago.         
	However, the late rain may see an increase in sugarcane as well as paddy production in the north Indian states. The rain is likely to continue for another three-four days, according to the meteorological department.         
	National Federation of Cooperative Sugar Factories Limited said the rain could improve production from an earlier estimated 15mt to anything between 16mt and 18mt. Sugar production in the 2009-10 season is estimated at 16 million tonnes, Indian Sugar Mills Association vice-president Vivek Saraogi said.         
	The government has taken measures to curb prices and improve supplies over the past four months. These include reducing the duty on imports and suspension of futures trading till December.

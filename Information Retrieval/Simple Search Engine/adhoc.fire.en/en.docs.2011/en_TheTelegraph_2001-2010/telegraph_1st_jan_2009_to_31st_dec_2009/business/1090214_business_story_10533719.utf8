The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Sebi makes takeover of Satyam-like firms easy
                                                                                                               Sebi makes takeover of Satyam-like firms easy
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                      
	Mumbai, Feb. 13: The capital market regulator today set the ground rules for the takeover of distressed companies such as Satyam Computer Services Ltd.        
	The Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) has stipulated that such entities should come out with a transparent and competitive bidding process to facilitate a takeover.        
	It said no competitive bid could be made once an acquirer  who has emerged successful after a bidding process  had made a public announcement.        
	The regulator relaxed the takeover norms applicable under Chapter III of the Substantial Acquisition of Shares and Takeovers Regulations, 1997, in special cases such as Satyam.        
	Chapter III deals with a mandatory open offer that an entity has to make once it acquires 15 per cent in a company.        
	The regulator said if the target company (in this case Satyam) filed an application, it would consider relaxing more provisions under this chapter if certain conditions were met.        
	First, the relaxations would apply in those companies where the Centre, state government or any other regulator authority had removed the board of directors of the target company and appointed other persons to hold office as directors.         
	It may be recalled that the Centre had superseded the Satyam board last month.        
	Among other conditions that companies need to meet before seeking a relaxation in the acquisition rules, the regulator said the government-appointed directors should have devised a plan which provides for transparent, open and a competitive process for continued operation of the target company.         
	It has also stipulated that such a plan should not further the interest of any particular acquirer.        
	The board of the company would also need to devise a process that laid down the details, including the timing of a public offer, and the manner in which the change of control would be effected.        
	Sebi said if it felt that its Chapter-III provisions were hindering the implementation of the target companys plan and the relaxation was in the interest of public, investors and the market, it could ease the rules.        
	However, the market regulator did not say whether it would insist that the winning bidder come out with an open offer at a price determined on the basis of a 26-week average.        
	After the market regulator is satisfied that a transparent mechanism for the sale price has been followed, the company can go ahead and complete the process.        
	Sebi has not stipulated the amount of equity that has to be offered to an interested player.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Policy fillip for exports
                                                                                                               Policy fillip for exports
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                            
	New Delhi, Aug. 27: The government today said it planned to cut transaction costs of exporters and ensure an adequate availability of dollar credit.        
	The Foreign Trade Policy for 2009-14 also extended tax sops and gave incentives for tapping new markets in Africa and Latin America.         
	My immediate priority is to arrest and reverse the declining trend in exports, commerce minister Anand Sharma said, while unveiling the policy today.        
	Exports were at $168.7 billion in 2008-09, and the policy had set a target of $200 billion for 2010-11.         
	Subsequently, the government has fixed an annual growth target of 25 per cent.         
	By 2014, we expect to double Indias exports of goods and services. The long-term policy objective for the government is to double Indias share in global trade by 2020, Sharma said.        
	It is a very realistic trade policy. I think new products (and) new countries have been best thought out, Confederation of Indian Industry director-general Chandrajit Banerjee said.        
	Recession in the US and Europe has caused a sharp drop in exports since October leading to heavy job cuts. In the last fiscal, exports grew just 3.4 per cent and missed the target for the year; in the first quarter of this fiscal exports fell 31.3 per cent.        
	I would be hesitant to hazard a guess on the nature and extent of economic recovery and the time the major economies will take to return to their pre-recession growth levels, Sharma said        
	The government will focus on cutting transaction costs through online initiatives that will reduce paperwork. As part of this exercise, the countrys 30 ports will be linked electronically, which will facilitate a faster exchange of information and reduce procedural delays. In addition, the government has reduced the various application fees by as much as 25 per cent.        
	The government has set up a panel comprising the finance secretary, commerce secretary and chairman of the Indian Banks Association, which will meet regularly to ensure adequate availability of dollar credit.        
	The government has also extended the duty entitlement passbook scheme  which offers duty credit  by a year till December 2010.        
	Besides, 100 per cent export oriented units and software technology parks will be entitled to various tax benefits in the next fiscal. The interest subsidy of 2 per cent for pre-shipment credit has also been extended till March 2010.        
	The government has proposed to relax the export promotion capital goods scheme scheme to facilitate the export of second hand plant and machinery. The policy has identified 26 new markets for trade, where exporters will be eligible for sops. These include 16 in Latin America and 10 in Asia and Oceania.        
	A. Sakthivel, president of the Federation of Indian Exports Organisation, said, The strategy to meet the dollar credit needs in a timely manner will help exporters.        
	However, Sakthivel wants the government to extend the market linked focus product scheme for garment exporters by another three years. The policy will be reviewed after two years.

          OUR CORRESPONDENT                      Ramalinga Raju in Hyderabad on Tuesday. (AP)                          
	New Delhi, March 17: The Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (ICAI) has given more time to Price Waterhouse (Bangalore) to respond to the show-cause notices vis--vis the Satyam scam.        
	The four Price Waterhouse (PW) accountants  P. Shiva Prasad, C.H. Ravindranath, Srinivas Talluri and S. Gopalakrishnan  have been given time till April 2 to reply to the notices, said Uttam Prakash Agarwal, president of the ICAI.         
	This is the third extention given to the partners.        
	Vadlamani Srinivas, the former chief financial officer of Satyam, has also been given time till April 9 to respond to the notice issued to him.         
	Agarwal said the PW auditors had requested for reasonable and realistic time considering the volume of records.         
	The ICAI had issued notices to the members of PW (Bangalore) in January. The auditors were asked to respond within 21 days.         
	Following a request by the auditors, the deadline was extended till March 2.         
	The ICAI also plans to scrutinise the accounts of companies whose independent directors have quit in the last two months.         
	This decision was taken in our financial review reporting board and it will depend on the situation under which independent directors have quit, Agarwal said.

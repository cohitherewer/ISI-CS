                                                                                                               Sensex rally takes a break
          OUR BUREAU                                            
	Mumbai, May 20: The sensex today shed 241 points, snapping a three-day winning streak. However, second-line stocks scored huge gains in highly volatile trade on heavy FII buying.        
	Coming off its days high of 14405.51, the BSE barometer settled at 14060.66, a fall of 241.37 points, or 1.69 per cent, from its previous close.        
	Investor sentiment in the mid-caps and small-caps was bolstered by reports that the Life Insurance Corporation plans to invest Rs 50,000 crore in the stock market in this fiscal. Real estate major DLF and ICICI Bank were the top losers.         
	DLF was down 7.77 per cent, while the countrys largest private sector lender ICICI Bank shed 6.56 per cent followed by Bharti Airtel (6.06 per cent) and Bhel (5.75 per cent).         
	The broader 50-share Nifty of the National Stock Exchange also tumbled 48.15 points, or 1.11 per cent, to close at 4270.30.        
	Bonanza Portfolio Assistant vice-president Avinash Gupta said, This was a day of huge volumes amid high volatility. The volumes in the cash market were more than Rs 40,000 crore at the NSE, which is a record.        
	Brokers said sustained bouts of buying and selling in frontline counters, particularly in the market heavyweight Reliance Industries and bank stocks, triggered a high level of volatility.         
	The mid-cap and small-cap indices outperformed the sensex, shooting up 6.03 per cent and 8.86 per cent, respectively.        
	Investors continued to be upbeat amid reports that an ambitious reform agenda was being drawn up for implementation in first 100 days of the new government.        
	The rupee surged 31 paise to 47.48 against the dollar on fairly good sales of the US currency by exporters in the face of sustained capital inflows into equity.        
	The appreciating rupee, triggered fresh selling in IT stocks for the second consecutive day.        
	On the BSE, business volume dropped to Rs 8,415.09 crore from Rs 11,781.35 crore on Tuesday.

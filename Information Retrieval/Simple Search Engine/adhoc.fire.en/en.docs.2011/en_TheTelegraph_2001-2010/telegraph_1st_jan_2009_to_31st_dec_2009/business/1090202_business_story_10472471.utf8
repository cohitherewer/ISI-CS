	New Delhi, Feb. 1: Tourism players are on a marketing overdrive to beat the global slowdown which has hit the inflow of foreign travellers.        
	The Federation of Hotel and Restaurant Associations of India (FHRAI) is orchestrating campaigns and organising travel marts. This is the Visit India Year, and Jaipur will host a major travel mart in March.        
	We are making all the effort to woo tourists to our country. Be it the Visit India 2009 campaign or the travel mart scheduled to be held in Jaipur in March, the government is making an effort. We expect some improvement in the current situation from April, said Harish Sood, secretary-general of the association.        
	According to government data, tourist arrivals have grown six per cent at 5.3 million in 2008 against 5.08 million a year ago.        
	Foreign exchange earnings have risen 14 per cent to Rs 50,730 crore from Rs 44,260 crore a year ago.        
	Going by the numbers, it was good growth as last quarter was specifically low because of the global economic meltdown and the Mumbai attacks. Despite that, in December, we saw more than five lakh tourist arrivals, which was very encouraging, said Leena Nandan, joint secretary in the tourism ministry.        
	However, arrivals fell to 5.22 lakh in December 2008 against 5.96 lakh in the year-ago period.         
	According to a study by business chamber PHDCCI, October-December saw cancellations by tour operators rising 20 per cent because of the terror attacks.        
	In October last year, there was a mere 1.8 per cent rise in the number of foreign tourists coming to India. The increase in foreign tourist arrivals in October 2007 compared with the same month in 2006 was 13.6 per cent, the study said.         
	According to the chamber, tourism has been badly hit by recession in the US and the UK. Delhi hotels  whose major clients comprise foreign tourists and business travellers  have seen a 20-25 per cent drop in room occupancy during October-December 2008 against the same period a year ago.         
	Nandan said though the government had not set a year-on-year tourism target, but by 2010, we expect the number to touch 10 million.

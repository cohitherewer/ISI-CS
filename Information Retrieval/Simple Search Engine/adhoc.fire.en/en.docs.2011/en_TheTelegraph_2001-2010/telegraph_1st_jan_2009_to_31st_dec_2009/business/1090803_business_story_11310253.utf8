                                                                                                               A matter of choice
        Check out the mortality rates before you opt for Ulip, says Srikumar Bondyopadhyay                                            
	Manoj Roy bought a unit-linked life insurance plan from a private insurer four years ago. He paid an annual premium of Rs 30,000 for a life cover of Rs 1.5 lakh. He recently surrendered his insurance policy, getting a fund value of Rs 40,000 against a total premium payment of Rs 1,20,000 for four years.        
	The fate of Ashok Mullick is no different. Ashoks fund value at the end of three years stood at Rs 75,000, while his annual premium is Rs 40,000. He, too, is planning to discontinue the insurance policy before paying the fourth premium installment. Both Ashok and Manoj have suffered losses by opting for Ulip  which is neither a wise investment choice nor a good insurance product.        
	Not the best option        
	Ulips include the worse of both worlds. Even after the record bull run in the stock markets from 2004 till early 2008, Ulips have given negligible returns.         
	In terms of insurance, too, the cover offered is not sufficient.         
	Why is this so?        
	Ulips bring with them high costs, involving numerous charges for premium allocation, policy administration, fund management, mortality, rider premium, surrender and service fees.        
	Premium allocation charge is the difference between the gross premium paid and the amount actually invested. This is used to pay the agency commission and other marketing expenses. The policy administration charge varies from Rs 700 to Rs 1,500 per annum.        
	Mortality charge is the premium collected for providing the life cover. It is calculated on the sum at risk, that is the amount the insurer will have to pay if the policyholder dies.        
	Since an insurer collects premium from a policyholder, the sum at risk at the beginning of a policy year will be the difference between the sum assured and the aggregate premium collected before the given policy year or the fund value in the policyholders account, depending on whether it is a traditional plan or a unit-linked one. In a traditional plan, the investment risk is with the insurer, while in a Ulip, the policyholder bears the risk.         
	The mortality charge increases with the age of the policyholder and depending on the fund value, the deduction may rise or fall.        
	The calculations for these charges are also too complex. While some charges are levied on the premium, some are calculated on the sum assured and appropriated by knocking off units from the policyholders account. Some charges are fixed and some are based on the net asset value of the investment fund.         
	Tough calculation        
	To compare between Ulips is even more complicated. Charges not only vary from one insurer to another, they also differ from one plan to another within the same insurers product portfolio. The premium rates of Ulips have also gone up after they were brought under the service tax net in 2008-09.        
	Insurers are required to pay service tax on fund management and the gross amount chargeable is defined as part of the premium amount retained by them, net of mortality charges and investment fund.         
	For example, if the annual premium is Rs 100, of which Rs 85 is invested and mortality charge is Rs 10, then the gross amount retained by the insurer will be Rs 100 minus (Rs 10 + Rs 85), or Rs 5. But this Rs 5 goes towards paying the agents commission.         
	Besides, the mortality charge in a Ulip is appropriated from the investment fund by knocking of units of equivalent value. The service tax rule, thus, puts Ulips at a disadvantageous position compared with mutual funds  while premium charges went up as insurers passed on the tax burden to policyholders, returns came down. On an average, return from Ulips came down by 0.4 percentage points to 0.6 percentage points because of the service tax levy.        
	To lower the tax burden and bring down the overall Ulip fee to reasonable levels, the insurance regulator has capped the charges effective from October 1 this year.         
	According to the regulator, the overall charges in a Ulip will be capped at 3 per cent of the fund value if it is a 10-year policy, and at 2.25 per cent if the policy term is more than 10 years. There are also sub-limits on the fund management charge within this overall limit  it is 1.5 per cent for policies up to 10 years and 1.15 per cent above 10 years.        
	However, insurers have already been charging 1-1.5 per cent as fund management fee for equity investment in various Ulips        
	So, the IRDA order, if implemented, will reduce the premium allocation and policy administration charges.         
	Charge burden        
	A lower cost structure may result in higher returns, between 0.5 and 1.5 percentage points, depending on the plan. Life insurers, however, are persuading the IRDA to exclude mortality charges from the overall cap. Insurers argue that the mortality charge increases with the rise in the age of the policyholder and hence it cannot be subjected to the overall cap. The mortality charge differs widely from one insurer to another (see table) for the same age group. Even for the same insurer, the mortality charge varies from one product to another.         
	A higher mortality charge signifies that the insurer experiences higher policy claims corresponding to the relevant age group and insurance plan.        
	After premium allocation and fund management fee, mortality premium is the highest charge that a policyholder pays in a Ulip. Thus, a higher mortality charge is bound to reduce your investment value as it is appropriated through the cancellation of units of equivalent value.        
	Know your policy        
	Insurers dont generally reveal the mortality charge table to prospective policy buyers. But a policy buyer must ask for the mortality charges and compare among different insurers and plans.        
	Insurers assume two scenarios  when the investment grows at 6 per cent and when the growth is 10 per cent. In either case, no decline in fund value because of market movements is considered. When the fund value comes down, the sum at risk increases and hence more units get deducted from your investment account.         
	Thus, if mortality charges are excluded from the overall cap on charges in Ulips, policy buyers will be denied of the benefits they would have got because of the imposition of the IRDA order.                          
	The customer-centric benefit illustrations as provided by insurers also dont give a clear picture on total deduction towards mortality charge.

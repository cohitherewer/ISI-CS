	Yekaterinburg (Russia), June 16 (Reuters): The leaders of the worlds biggest emerging markets demanded a greater say in the global financial system on Tuesday at their first summit, but steered clear of any assault on the US dollars dominance.        
	The summit of Brazil, Russia, India and China (BRIC) ended with a short statement by Russian President Dmitry Medvedev and a communique which demanded more power for developing nations in international financial institutions and the United Nations.        
	But it did not mention two key Moscow initiatives  a smaller role for the US dollar and a supranational reserve currency although a Russian delegation source told Reuters that BRIC finance ministries and central banks were tasked to work on reserve currencies proposals.         
	We are committed to advance the reform of international financial institutions, so as to reflect changes in the world economy, a joint communique issued by the BRIC countries said.        
	The emerging and developing economies must have a greater voice and representation in international financial institutions, it said.        
	In the run-up to the summit, the Kremlin said reserve currencies would be discussed and that the world needed more reserve currencies.        
	But China  which holds nearly $2 trillion in foreign currency reserves  was silent, indicating little unity on any potential challenge to the greenback.        
	Analysts say the BRIC four are united by strong economic growth in recent years but not much else. Their political standpoints and global priorities differ widely and diplomats question whether the forum can forge strong, united positions.        
	The US dollar slid on Tuesday on Russias comments, which came a day after finance minister Alexei Kudrin said the dollars status as the worlds main reserve currency would be unlikely to change in the near term.        
	The BRIC term was coined by Goldman Sachs economist Jim Neill in 2001 to describe the growing power of emerging market economies, but Tuesdays summit was an attempt to give the grouping a bigger voice in the world.        
	We talked about making the decision-making process on the most important international issues  on the economic agenda, the international political agenda on security  fairer, said Medvedev in his final statement after the meeting.        
	The other leaders sat next to Medvedev as he made the final statement.

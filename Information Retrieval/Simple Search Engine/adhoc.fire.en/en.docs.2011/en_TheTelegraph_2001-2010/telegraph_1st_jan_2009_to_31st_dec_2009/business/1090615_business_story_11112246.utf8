The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | ACC keen on Bengal plant
                                                                                                               ACC keen on Bengal plant
          SAMBIT SAHA                                    
	Calcutta, June 14: Cement major ACC Ltd has expressed interest in building a 2-million-tonne plant in Bengal.        
	The company, owned by Swiss cement giant Holcim, has held talks with state government officials on the project.        
	The estimated investment could be in the range of Rs 300-500 crore, depending on the product mix.         
	Apart from a grinding unit, ACC may also set up a ready-mix concrete plant.         
	When contacted by The Telegraph, ACC managing director Sumit Banerjee confirmed that the company had looked at a site near Kharagpur, though it was yet to firm up plans.        
	We do look for land for strategic reasons at different sites. At present, we do not have any firm plans for a grinding unit in Kharagpur. It is one of the many possible sites. However, it must be said that Bengal and Calcutta, in particular, are important to us. In the long term, we would love to move closer to this market, Banerjee said.        
	In Bengal, ACC has a 0.5mt grinding plant in Durgapur and two ready-mix concrete units.        
	The development comes at a time when the ruling Left Front governments industrialisation drive has met with stiff opposition, both from within the party and outside. Many big ticket projects in the state are now showing little signs of progress.        
	The poor show of the Left Front in Bengal at the Lok Sabha polls has largely been attributed to the state governments land acquisition policy.        
	However, if ACC chooses to go ahead with its plan, it may not have to face any land-related problems.         
	The West Bengal Industrial Development Corporation (WBIDC) had been able to acquire a plot surrounding the Tata Telcon project near Kharagpur.        
	We have identified 150 acres for ACC in an industrial park which the WBIDC is building around the Tata Telcon project near Kharagpur, Subrata Gupta, managing director of the WBIDC, said.        
	The state agency has acquired around 900 acres in the area and is in the process of acquiring another 100 acres.        
	It has paid Rs 10 lakh on an average to the owners who willingly gave up the land.        
	We are now developing the plot to lease out to prospective investors. Apart from ACC, mining firm PH Minepro have also shown an interest, Gupta said.        
	The WBIDC had conducted a socio-economic survey of around 3,000 people who had given up land for industrial purposes.         
	The study revealed that the land owners aspired for roads, good sanitation, electricity and health centres.        
	Investors in the park will be asked to take up some of the social projects. Tata Telcon has donated a school bus to villagers and promised to build a school to provide training on handling earth-moving equipment.

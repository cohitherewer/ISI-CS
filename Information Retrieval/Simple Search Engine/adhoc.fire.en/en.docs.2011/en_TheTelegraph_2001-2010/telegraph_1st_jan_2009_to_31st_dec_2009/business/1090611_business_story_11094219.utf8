The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Singh gets 3G call from Raja 
                                                                                                               Singh gets 3G call from Raja 
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                          Raja: On the fast track                                  
	New Delhi, June 10: Telecom minister A. Raja today met Prime Minister Manmohan Singh to discuss 3G auctions and the allocation of 2G spectrum to existing mobile players. Raja also pushed for the extension of tax sops to IT firms.         
	Raja had earlier told The Telegraph that he was confident of completing the auction of third-generation (3G) service licences and spectrum by the end of 2009.         
	A note on the 3G auction process and the base price will be sent to the cabinet next week, said officials in the department of telecom (DoT). The auction will take off within two months of getting cabinet approval, the officials said.        
	The auction of 3G licences is expected to fetch the government around Rs 30,000 crore, helping it to narrow the widening fiscal deficit.         
	Raja and Singh also discussed second-generation (2G) spectrum allocation. At present, operators are eligible for additional spectrum according to their subscriber base. The Prime Minister and the finance ministry are in favour of auctions, while Raja insists on allocating spectrum on a first come, first served basis.        
	Raja also discussed the benefits of extending the tax sops to the infotech sector under the STPI scheme.        
	Under the Software Technology Parks of India scheme (STPI), IT companies are not taxed on revenues earned from exporting software. The incentive is available till March 2010. An extension of the tax waiver will benefit domestic IT firms hit by the global recession.        
	GSM launch by Tata Tele        
	CDMA telecom operator Tata Teleservices today announced the launch of GSM services in partnership with Japans NTT DoCoMo.         
	The company will invest $2 billion by the end of this financial year to roll out operations across the country under the Tata-DoCoMo brand. The services will be commercially rolled out towards the end of this month in the south, followed by launches in the western and the northern regions.

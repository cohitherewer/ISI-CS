The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Sebi to tweak open offer rules
                                                                                                               Sebi to tweak open offer rules
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                        Bhave in Mumbai on Monday. (PTI)      
	Mumbai, Feb. 2: The shenanigans at Satyam Computer Services have forced capital market watchdog Sebi to agree to amend open offer pricing norms even as a gaggle of suitors circles the scam-scarred software giant.        
	The one sticking point has been the rule that an open offer price must be determined on the basis of a six-month average. The regulation nixed the possibility of any bidder coming up with a credible open offer after the Satyam stock crumbled since January 7 once B. Ramalinga Raju confessed he had padded accounts and rigged the books for years.        
	Sebi chairman C. B. Bhave said the regulator would announce the rule change in the next few days to deal with special situations.        
	The amendment will apply to all listed companies even though Satyams new board of directors had written to the regulator seeking a waiver of the six-month rule because of the exceptional circumstances that had enveloped Indias fourth largest software exporter.        
	Satyams bidders have been deterred by the fact that the existing regulation will mean having to pay almost five times the current market price.        
	Sebi recognised the special circumstances that have arisen in Satyam, but concluded that the issue needs to be dealt with in the general context, Bhave told reporters after a meeting of the Sebi board here today.         
	It was decided to appropriately amend the regulations to enable a transparent process to arrive at the open offer price, Bhave said.        
	He added that the regulator was aware of the urgency of the situation and indicated that it would announce the proposed changes soon.        
	The speculation is that Sebi will shorten the time period for calculating the open offer price to two weeks.        
	The market regulator also reduced the period for completing a bonus issue to 15 days, where no shareholder approval is required, according to the articles of association of a company. For issues which require shareholders approval, the period for completing them has been brought down to 60 days.        
	At present, listed companies are required to complete a bonus issue within six months from the date on which the board of directors clears the issue.        
	In view of the poor market conditions, Sebi said a company coming out with an initial public offering (IPO) could declare the floor price or price band at least two working days before the issue opened. At present, either the floor price or the price band has to be disclosed in the red herring prospectus about two weeks before the IPO opens.        
	Allottees of preferential warrants will now have to pay an upfront margin of 25 per cent against 10 per cent at present.        
	The regulator also decided to amend the listing agreement so that listed entities could declare dividend on a per-share basis only. Some companies declare dividend either on a per share basis or as percentage of the face value of the shares. According to the Sebi chief, declaration of dividend as a percentage of face value has the potential to mislead investors.  
	PUSH FOR CHANGE  
	 Change in open offer pricing norm soon  
	 Bonus issue in 15 days, if shareholder approval is not required; otherwise, it should be in 60 days   
	 IPO floor price, or price band, at least two days before issue date  
	 Margin payment in preferential warrants now 25%   
	 Dividend on per share basis only

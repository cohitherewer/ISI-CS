The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Sebi seeks views on trade time
                                                                                                               Sebi seeks views on trade time
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Mumbai, March 19: Sebi has asked stockbrokers and investors to signal whether they want the local bourses to trade longer hours.        
	The capital market regulator today floated a discussion paper on the feasibility of allowing longer market hours, giving local investors the chance to trade on opportunities afforded by global events.        
	It said the Indian markets had adopted the best international standards and practices and the extension of market hours would be a logical step forward to integrate the Indian bourses with the global markets.        
	While the Asian markets are ahead of the Indian time zone, the European and American markets trade long after the Indian markets are closed.        
	Some countries have adopted longer trading hours  extending up to 23 hours in a few cases. This has facilitated market participants in these countries to hedge their risks that rise because of global information flows.         
	At present, the exchange-traded equity derivatives market in the country is open from 9.55am to 3.30pm, the same as the underlying cash market.         
	On the other hand, the exchange-traded currency derivatives market operates from 9am to 5pm.

	Mumbai, June 25: Pfizer  the worlds largest pharmaceutical company by sales  today raised its open offer price for the shares of its Indian subsidiary to Rs 830 per share, a 23 per cent increase over the earlier price of Rs 675 a share.        
	The price was raised because of the poor response to its open offer that opened on June 15 and was due to close on July 4.        
	Pfizer Investments Netherlands B.V., a wholly owned subsidiary of Pfizer Inc, is seeking to acquire a 33.77 per cent stake in India-based Pfizer Ltd from shareholders.        
	Novartis  the other multinational pharmaceutical giant which came out with an open offer  has received a good response from minority shareholders after raising its price to Rs 450 on May 28 from the initial price of Rs 351 a share.        
	Novartis today announced that it had completed its open offer to acquire an additional stake in its majority-owned Indian subsidiary, Novartis India Ltd.        
	It mopped up 25.49 per cent of the Indian units equity from its shareholders. The parents stake will go up to 76.43 per cent from 50.93 per cent.        
	In a statement, Novartis said the transaction represented a total value of around Rs 370 crore ($76 million) and that almost all large institutional investors and quasi-institutional shareholders had participated in the offer.        
	On April 13, the Pfizer India parent had offered to buy 10,078,143 shares of Pfizer Ltd for Rs 680 crore. This was part of its plan to raise its stake in the Indian company to around 75 per cent from the 41.23 per cent it now has.

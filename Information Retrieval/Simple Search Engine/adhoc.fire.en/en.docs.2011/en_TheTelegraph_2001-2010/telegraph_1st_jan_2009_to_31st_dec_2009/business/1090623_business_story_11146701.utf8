	Calcutta, June 22: City-based United Bank of India is planning to float its maiden public issue by December this year.         
	The Union government gave its approval to the banks capital restructuring plan in March, paving the way for the IPO, Satish C. Gupta, chairman and managing director of the UBI, said here today.        
	Speaking at a banking seminar organised by Ficci, Gupta said the bank would raise Rs 300-400 crore and file a draft prospectus with Sebi after September.        
	Through the capital restructuring programme, the United Bank (UBI) has reduced its equity capital to Rs 266 crore from Rs 1,532 crore at the end of March and pushed up its book value per share to Rs 94 from Rs 14.         
	At this book value, the proposed flotation could be priced in the range of Rs 150-180 a share.        
	Under the restructuring plan, we are in the process of transferring Rs 1,266 crore equity capital back to the government. Against this, the government will give us back from its revenue account the same amount which will then accrue to our capital reserves, Gupta said.        
	In addition, the UBI will receive Rs 800 crore from the government as preference capital.         
	We have received Rs 250 crore in March through an issuance of perpetual non-cumulative preference shares and expect to receive the remaining Rs 550 crore by September, Gupta said. The Rs 800 crore will comprise its Tier-I capital. The bank is also set to reduce its lending and deposit rates by 0.25-0.50 percentage points soon.         
	In 2008-09, UBI clocked a business of Rs 90,263 crore.

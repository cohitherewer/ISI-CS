The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Pranab sees 7% growth
                                                                                                               Pranab sees 7% growth
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                            
	New Delhi, Jan. 29: The finance ministry will focus on steering the vote-on-account through Parliament and ensuring that appropriate measures are in place for the economy to grow at 7 per cent.         
	External affairs minister Pranab Mukherjee, who is standing in as the finance minister following the illness of Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, today said that getting the vote-on-account through will be our first priority.         
	Growth would be around 7 per cent, instead of 8.8-8.9 per cent, he added.        
	Mukherjee met the heads of different departments within the finance ministry and top officials of the Central Board of Excise and Customs and the Central Board of Direct Taxes.         
	He reviewed the preparations for the vote-on-account and the implementation of the two stimulus packages announced by the government.        
	Among the stimulants are interest subsidies for exports, a 4 per cent cut in excise duties and a spending programme for infrastructure. Officials said the government was likely to announce a third package soon which would be more sector-specific.         
	GDP estimates        
	NCAER today slashed the countrys GDP growth projection for the current fiscal to 6.7 per cent, down from 7.6 per cent estimated earlier.        
	Overall GDP growth is projected to decline by 0.9 percentage points in 2008-09, compared with projections made in October 2008, NCAERs quarterly review said.        
	Wheat price         
	The government has increased the minimum support price (MSP) of wheat by Rs 80 to Rs 1,080 a quintal for the 2009-10 season.        
	This was done to induce farmers to plant more wheat and ensure a larger amount of the grain for ration shops. The move is also being seen as designed to satisfy the rural vote bank of northern India.        
	MSP for wheat has been fixed at Rs 1,080 a quintal, said railway minister Lalu Prasad after a meeting of the cabinet committee on economic affairs yesterday.        
	The issue had come up before the cabinet earlier but was deferred as several states had demanded an increase of up to 20 per cent in MSP. Global prices of wheat are at around Rs 950-1,000 a quintal.

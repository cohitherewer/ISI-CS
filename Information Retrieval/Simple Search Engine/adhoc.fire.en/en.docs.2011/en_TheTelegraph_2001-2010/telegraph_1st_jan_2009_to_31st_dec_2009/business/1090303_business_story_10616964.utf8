The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Stocks crash across globe
                                                                                                               Stocks crash across globe
                            
	New York, March 2 (Reuters): World stocks fell to their lowest level in almost six years on Monday and the dollar hit 3-year peaks after insurer AIG posted a $61.7 billion quarterly loss and HSBC launched Britains largest ever rights issue.        
	American International Group  the recipient of $150 billion in taxpayer aid last year  posted the largest quarterly loss in the US corporate history and took a $30-billion lifeline from the US government.        
	HSBC, Europes biggest bank, launched the $18-billion rights issue to shore up its balance sheet after it reported an 18 per cent fall in adjusted pre-tax profit for 2008 and cut its dividend.         
	Renewed concerns about the health of the financial sector sparked a sell-off in broader risky assets, knocking oil by more than 5 per cent, and fanned safety-seeking flows into government bonds across the board.        
	Major stock indices around the world slipped to new lows. MSCIs all-country world equity index slid more than 3 per cent at one point and the Dow fell more than 2 per cent after opening to below 7,000 for the first time since October 1997. The S amp;P 500 also slid more than 2 per cent.        
	I think whats really overhanging the market is AIG. We gave them all that money and they are obviously still bleeding terribly. They are mortally wounded, said Warren Simpson, managing director at Stephens Capital Management in Little Rock, Arkansas.

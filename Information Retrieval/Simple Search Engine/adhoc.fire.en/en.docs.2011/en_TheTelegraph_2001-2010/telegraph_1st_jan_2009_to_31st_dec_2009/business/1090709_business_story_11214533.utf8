The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Private role in job portal update
                                                                                                               Private role in job portal update
										      SOUNAK MITRA                                    
	Calcutta, July 8: Employment exchanges will soon get a national identity and a professional structure.        
	Private placement firms are eager to work with the government to make this project a success. Moreover, a national job portal is expected to go live within a year, the ministry of labour and employment said.         
	So far, job portals operate only at the regional level.        
	Mukherjee, in his budget speech, said employment exchanges would be modernised in public-private-partnership to enable a job seeker to register online from anywhere and approach any employment exchange in the country.        
	This will contain all data about skilled persons and industrys requirements. It will help young people get suitable jobs, and industry the right people, Mukherjee had said.        
	Placement agency Teamlease, which operates similar employment portals in Tamil Nadu and Rajasthan, had submitted a proposal to the Centre over a year back.        
	We are already into this and are also talking to other states. We would be happy to participate in this project, Neeti Sharma, vice-president of TeamLease Services, told The Telegraph.        
	Manpower.in, another staffing firm, said the project would help both the public and private employers as well as the job seekers.         
	This portal will gather information from 970 employment exchanges and function as a national portal, like any other private job portal, a source from the ministry of labour and employment said.

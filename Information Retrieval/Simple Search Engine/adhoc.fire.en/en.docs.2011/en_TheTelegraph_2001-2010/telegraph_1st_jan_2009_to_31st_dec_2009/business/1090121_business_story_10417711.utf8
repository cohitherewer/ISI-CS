The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Vote on account by mid-Feb
                                                                                                               Vote on account by mid-Feb
          JAYANTA ROY CHOWDHURY                              
	New Delhi, Jan. 20: The government may present its vote on account by mid-February instead of the end of the month when the Union budget is generally placed.         
	Since the government has only till May to hold fresh elections to Parliament, it cannot present a budget for the whole year but has to place a vote on account so that the present team can continue to function till a new one is sworn in after the elections.        
	A vote on account does not bring in fresh taxes, but merely states incomes and expenses for the past year.         
	However, the Manmohan Singh government is likely to use the chance to present both a report card of what it considers a good job of managing a difficult economic situation as well as a forward looking statement of what it intends to do if re-elected.        
	An economic survey, which normally precedes a budget, will also be brought out.        
	However, the government may still announce some sops for the common man. Cuts in cooking gas and kerosene rates, another instalment of arrears for civil servants, housing sops for the poor or interest sops for the retired and elderly could make it to the vote on account, said officials.        
	A third package for industry, especially export oriented sectors, could be announced around this time, officials said.

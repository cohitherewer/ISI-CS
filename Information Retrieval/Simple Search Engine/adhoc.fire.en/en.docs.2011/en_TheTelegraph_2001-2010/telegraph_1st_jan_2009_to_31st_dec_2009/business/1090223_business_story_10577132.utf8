	New Delhi, Feb. 22: Car companies are tying up with public sector banks, with the high interest rates of private banks a deterrent to strong sales.        
	While PSU banks charge between 10.5 per cent and 14 per cent interest rate, private lenders charge 13-16 per cent.         
	Tata Motors, Hyundai Motors India and Mahindra amp; Mahindra (M amp;M) have connected with PSU banks to attract customers and revive flagging sales.        
	Tata Motors has inked an MoU with Corporation Bank and the Central Bank of India.        
	According to the agreement, financing will be available at all 1,073 branches of the bank and at 329 outlets of Tata Motors.        
	Customers will get loans up to 85 per cent of a cars on-road price at 11.75 per cent, for five years.         
	Borrowers from the Central Bank of India will also get loans up to 85 per cent of the price, but for seven years. Interest rate is 10.5 per cent for a three-year loan and 11.5 per cent after that.        
	Since the beginning of the economic crisis, banks have been sceptical about loans, but there has been an improvement in the disbursements of PSU banks.        
	Public sector banks have definitely improved. Earlier, two-thirds of financing were from private banks and the rest from PSUs. Now, the ratio of state-owned banks is as high as 67 per cent. Our exposure to PSU banks is 60 per cent and the State Bank of India alone accounts for half of it, said Mayank Pareek, executive officer, Maruti Suzuki India Ltd.        
	Hyundai Motors India has tied up with Punjab National Bank, Canara Bank and Syndicate Bank.        
	Hyundais exposure to PSU banks stands at 30 per cent of its financing portfolio, with the SBI accounting for half of it.        
	According to auto analysts, PSU banks are capable of giving more loans because they have a strong presence in the interiors.        
	PSU banks have increased their share of car loans since sales are growing in smaller centres where these banks have a strong presence, said analyst Murad Ali Baig.         
	The share of PSU banks in financing our vehicles has gone up in recent months. Roughly 20 per cent of M amp;M vehicles are financed by PSU banks, said Rajesh Jejurikar, chief of operations, M amp;M.         
	The industry is looking at ways to improve the credit flow for buyers. Guidelines are being worked out for banks and NBFCs.         
	A meeting was held among government officials and the representatives of the Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers, which was also attended by officials of public and private banks as well as NBFCs.

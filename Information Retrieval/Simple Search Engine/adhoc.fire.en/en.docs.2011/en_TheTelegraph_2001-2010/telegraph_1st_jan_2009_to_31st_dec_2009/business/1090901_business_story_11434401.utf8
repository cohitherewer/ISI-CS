The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Finance secretary upbeat
                                                                                                               Finance secretary upbeat
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Mumbai, Aug. 31: The economy may grow by 6.5 per cent or more this fiscal, finance secretary Ashok Chawla today said.         
	We expect the (GDP) growth rate to be 6.5 per cent or above. Growth in the economy (now) is very encouraging, and it is expected to improve further, Chawla told reporters here.         
	He said he was confident that growth could be sustained on the back of good performances by the manufacturing and services sectors.        
	According to the finance secretary, the adverse impact of the weak monsoon on agricultural output is unlikely to affect overall growth as the sector contributes only 18 per cent to the countrys GDP.        
	The manufacturing and services sectors will compensate for any shortfall in agriculture.        
	Chawla said the growth in the index for industrial production (around 5 per cent) and services sector (around 8 per cent) was also promising.        
	The government is working with various regulators to push for reforms in the financial sector, Chawla said.        
	Chamber views        
	The stimulus measures taken by the government are yielding results on the ground and there is a clear case for continuing these for some more time, Ficci president Harsh Pati Singhania said.        
	The GDP numbers indicate that the economy has bottomed out, CII director-general Chandrajit Banerjee said.        
	Assocham said it would not be correct to compare the performance of the economy this fiscal with last year, given the current economic scenario in which demand creation is still a challenge.

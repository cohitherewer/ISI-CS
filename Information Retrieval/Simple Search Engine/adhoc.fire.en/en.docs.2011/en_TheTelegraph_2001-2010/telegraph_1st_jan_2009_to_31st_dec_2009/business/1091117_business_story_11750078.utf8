          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Pranab Mukherjee in New Delhi on Monday. (PTI)                                  
	New Delhi, Nov. 16: The government will not reverse the fiscal stimulus, which has resulted in a 9.1 per cent industrial growth in September, till there is strong evidence of recovery. However, soaring food prices remained a major concern.        
	Stimulus will be removed when the economy is firmly on the path of recovery. The common man had been cushioned against the global slowdown by government regulation, finance minister Pranab Mukherjee said at an industry event.        
	Mukherjee also allayed industry fears about the high fiscal deficit leaving them with little resources. The low credit offtake and ample liquidity make such apprehensions irrelevant.        
	Cabinet secretary K.M. Chandrasekhar said certain parts of the stimulus package might be retained, while others might go.        
	The general indication today is that stimulus will continue this year. Let us not think stimulus is something that will be withdrawn all at once, he said.        
	Mukherjee feels the farm market is imperfect. A huge gap exists between the consumer price and the price received by the primary producers. While farmers do not get (remunerative) prices, consumers end up paying more than what should be paid if the agriculture markets are competitive and efficient, he said.        
	The cabinet secretary said prices had to be watched and he was confident that they would moderate once the supply situation improved.        
	Mukherjee said the proposed goods and services tax would help lower the incidence of taxes by avoiding the cascading effect of multiple levies.

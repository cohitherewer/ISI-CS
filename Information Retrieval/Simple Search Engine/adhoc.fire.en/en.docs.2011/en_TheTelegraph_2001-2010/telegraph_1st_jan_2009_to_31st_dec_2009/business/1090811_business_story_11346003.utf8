The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Onus on Patel to plead for airlines
                                                                                                               Onus on Patel to plead for airlines
										      OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT        Civil aviation minister Praful Patel (right) with airline chiefs in New Delhi on Monday. (PTI)                                    
	New Delhi, Aug. 10: Airline operators today urged civil aviation minister Praful Patel to take up their case for cutting taxes on jet fuel and airport charges before the Union cabinet.         
	Less than a fortnight ago, private airlines had called a one-day strike on August 18 to press for their demands relating to jet fuel and airport charges, only to call it off after the government talked tough.        
	Patel is expected to make a presentation on the aviation sectors losses and highlight the need to cut fuel taxes before the cabinet on Thursday.         
	Among those to meet Patel today  as part of a delegation of the Federation of Indian Airlines (FIA)  were Air India chairman and managing director Arvind Jadhav, Jet Airways chairman Naresh Goyal, Kingfisher Airlines chairman and managing director Vijay Mallya, SpiceJet chief executive officer Sanjay Agarwal, IndiGo chairman Rahul Bhatia and president Aditya Ghosh, GoAir managing director Jeh Wadia and FIA secretary-general Anil Baijal.         
	We presented our case before the minister, and he was very sympathetic towards us, said Mallya after the meeting.        
	Private airlines withdrew their strike call after SpiceJet, the biggest of Indias low-cost airlines, broke ranks with the other operators. SpiceJet joined hands with another low-cost carrier IndiGo and said it was not interested in a bailout or a confrontation with the state.         
	The government had earlier made it clear that it would not talk while a strike threat was in the air. Besides, the directorate general of civil aviation had issued notices to private airlines seeking an explanation on the reasons for calling a strike and demanding a refund for cancelled flights.        
	The Federation of Indian Airlines  which represents the interests of the operators  has been demanding a cut in jet fuel taxes to 4 per cent from an average rate of 26 per cent across the country.         
	Jet fuel makes up 35-40 per cent of an airlines cost, and a cut in taxes can pull many airlines out of the red.         
	The industry is believed to have notched up losses to the tune of Rs 10,000 crore last year. The FIA has also called for cut in other charges, including airport development levy, landing charges and navigational fees.         
	Officials said they expected the civil aviation ministry to restart talks with airport bodies and airlines, and get the newly appointed Airports Economic Regulatory Authority of India to put a leash on airport charges.         
	At the same time, the ministry is likely to urge state governments to cut jet fuel taxes. The levy varies across states.        
	The officials said the government had long advocated a declared goods status for jet fuel, which could bring down the tax from as high as 29 per cent in some states to a uniform rate of 4 per cent.        
	Andhra Pradesh has the lowest tax on jet fuel at 4 per cent, while Bihar and Tamil Nadu have the highest at 29 per cent. West Bengal charges 25 per cent.         
	However, the Centre has not gone ahead and granted the declared good status because of opposition from the states who have not accepted the logic for reducing taxes.

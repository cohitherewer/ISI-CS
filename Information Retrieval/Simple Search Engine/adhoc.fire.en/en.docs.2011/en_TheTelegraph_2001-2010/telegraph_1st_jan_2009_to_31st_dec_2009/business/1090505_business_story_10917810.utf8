	Mumbai, May 4: Tata Motors has raised Rs 2,500 crore from the bookings for the Nano.        
	The car maker said it had received 2.03 lakh fully paid bookings for the little runabout that would hit the roads in July.         
	A total of 6.10 lakh forms were purchased from the booking centres.         
	A press release issued today said 70 per cent of the bookings were financed, while 30 per cent of the applicants had paid the full amount in cash.        
	Among the three variants of the car, 20 per cent of the bookings were for the Nano Standard, 30 per cent for the Nano CX and the remaining 50 per cent for the top-end Nano LX.                          
	The first 100,000 allottees from among the applicants will be chosen through a computerised random selection procedure.        
	The announcement will be made within 60 days of closure of the booking. Deliveries are expected to be completed by the last quarter of 2010, the release said.

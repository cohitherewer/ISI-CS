	Calcutta, Dec. 5: The proposed changes in the central mine allocation policy may spell doom for a number of mega steel projects in Bengal.        
	The revision favours open auction of various mine blocks, including coal, where the highest bidder will walk away with the right to develop and sell mineral resources.        
	Bengal industry minister Nirupam Sen today said the coal ministry was in favour of auction of untapped reserves in the state, while it was not stating clearly if past practices  where states had a say in mine allotment  would be dumped.        
	The state had asked for 15 coal blocks to distribute among industries, especially steel. Sen said it had so far got only six and nothing had come after 2006.        
	The Centre used to allocate these blocks under the state dispensation route whereby the state government had the right to decide who would mine.        
	The Bengal government had allocated blocks to steel companies such as JSW Bengal, Jai Balaji Group to set up projects in the state.        
	However, many more are in the queue  Videocon, Kalyani Steel, Bhushan Steel among others  to get coal through the state list.        
	The chief minister and I have met the coal minister. The chief minister even met the Prime Minister but we have not got any more mines. Yesterday, I got a letter from the coal minister saying the Centre would pursue open auction. It is a matter of great concern for us, Sen said while speaking at the Steel Conclave organised by industry body CII.        
	The letter did not say if the state dispensation route would be done away with, Sen added. The Bengal government has signed several agreements with firms in the metal sector promising them a coal block once the Centre allocated.        
	If the companies are now asked to bid, they may not choose to set up a plant in Bengal which does not have iron ore, the other main ingredient in steelmaking.        
	Steel companies came to Bengal in the hope of getting coal to produce cheap power to fire the steel plant.        
	This is bad news, said JSW Bengal managing director Biswadip Gupta.

	New Delhi, April 21: Central banks across the world are cutting rates to battle the recession.        
	Sweden, Australia and Pakistan have cut rates, while the European Central Bank and Brazil may follow suit.        
	Central banks of major economies, including those of Europe, the US, Australia, Japan and India have been talking to each other before taking decisions. That is reflected in their timing of rate cuts perhaps, a finance ministry official said.        
	In Pakistan, the central bank reduced its benchmark rate by one per cent to 14 per cent on Monday.         
	Pakistan had raised benchmark rates by 5 per cent to battle a multi-decade high inflation of 25.3 per cent last August. The countrys growth is expected to slow down to between 2.5 per cent and 3.5 per cent from 5.8 per cent last year.        
	The Reserve Bank of Australia has cut rates by a quarter per cent bringing down policy rates to a 50-year low of 3 per cent.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          C. Rangarajan (right) in New Delhi on Wednesday. (PTI)                                   
	New Delhi, Oct. 21: The Indian economy has braved the global meltdown and will grow around 6.5 per cent this year against 6.7 per cent last year, a panel of top economists appointed by the Prime Minister said today.        
	In a report submitted to Manmohan Singh, the Prime Ministers Economic Advisory Council today forecast that the economy would grow 6.5 per cent during this fiscal but added that the growth could accelerate to 6.75 per cent if manufacturing continued to do well.        
	C. Rangarajan, chairman of the council and a former RBI governor, said: The manufacturing sector is expected to grow 7.7 per cent against a paltry 2.4 per cent last year, but the impact of a poor monsoon on farm growth (forecast to be -2 per cent) will put pressure on the overall GDP growth.         
	Rangarajan, who sees inflation rising to 6 per cent by end-March, said, The stance of the monetary policy will have to change from its highly accommodative position (of low interest rates to encourage economic recovery). But that has to wait. It will depend on the growth prospects of the economy and also inflationary pressures.        
	The RBI is expected to keep interest rates on hold when it meets for its quarterly policy review on October 27, though many economists are predicting a tightening of rates in early 2010.        
	 In the short term, managing inflationary risks, particularly food-price inflation, is the biggest challenge facing our policy-makers, Rangarajan said. Given the present signs of inflationary pressures, we have to act earlier than the US and the European economies.        
	Industry, including construction, is expected to grow 8.2 per cent in 2009-10 against 3.9 per cent in the previous year. The services sector is expected to grow 8.2 per cent this year, lower than the 9.7 per cent recorded in 2008-09.        
	However, the drought is expected to bring down foodgrain production from 234 million tonnes (mt) to 223 mt. To some extent the decline in kharif (monsoon sown crops) will be overcome by rabi crops which are expected to do well, but overall farm growth will still be impacted, Rangarajan said.

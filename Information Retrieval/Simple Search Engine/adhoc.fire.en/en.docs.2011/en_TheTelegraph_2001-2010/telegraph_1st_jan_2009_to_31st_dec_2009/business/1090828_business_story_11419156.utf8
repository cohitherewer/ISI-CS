	Calcutta, Aug. 27: Savings by households increased only 4.31 per cent in 2008-09, according to the Reserve Bank of India.        
	In a preliminary estimate of the apex bank, the gross financial savings of households in 2008-09 were Rs 7,46,865 crore, a growth of 4.31 per cent over the previous year.         
	In 2007-08, the savings grew 10.08 per cent to Rs 7,15,994 crore.         
	The stock market crash last year along with the economic downturn made small investors edgy, and they pulled Rs 10,478 crore out of mutual funds. In 2007-08, investment in mutual funds stood at Rs 56,799 crore, a rise of 63.64 per cent over 2006-07.        
	The share of households in equities of private companies remained almost flat at Rs 31,124 crore compared with Rs 31,565 crore in 2007-08.         
	Withdrawal in government securities was a huge Rs 33,879 crore compared with Rs 14,714 crore in 2007-08.        
	Investors scampered for safer options such as bank fixed deposits, small savings and life insurance plans. High interest rates on fixed deposits till October last year were also an added attraction for switching from risky investments in equities and mutual funds.

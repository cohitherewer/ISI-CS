The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Strides prescribes split
                                                                                                               Strides prescribes split
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                           Strategic move                                  
	Mumbai, April 13: Bangalore-based Strides Arcolab will split its operations into three entities  specialty pharmaceuticals, pharmaceuticals and research and development (R amp;D).         
	Strides will hive off its specialty pharmaceuticals business into a wholly owned subsidiary  Strides Specialties. While the pharmaceuticals business will continue under Strides Arcolab, the R amp;D business will be spun off into another wholly owned subsidiary called Strides Technology and Research.         
	Strides sterile drugs, including injectables, contribute a little over 35 per cent to its consolidated revenues.         
	The R amp;D segment accounts for 10 per cent and pharmaceuticals comprise a large part of the rest.         
	According to group CEO Arun Kumar, The reorganisation of the business is a major step towards attaining greater efficiency and customer-focused business units while still retaining the aggressive and entrepreneurial spirit of Strides. Both our business units will be backed by a strong and independent R amp;D function.         
	He said the new structure would ensure aggressive growth aided by specific business strategies.         
	Speaking to The Telegraph from Bangalore, T.S. Rangan, group CFO of Strides Arcolab, said the restructuring would enable the company to have greater focus on each segment.         
	In the sterile drugs segment, there are not too many players now. This will sharpen our focus, he said.         
	He said the benefits would also accrue to the other businesses. The move would give a competitive edge to the company in the R amp;D segment, where it has received more than 15 abbreviated new drug applications.         
	Here too, the reorganisation will bring the required focus and increase shareholder value. Moreover, it will give better operational flexibility. The benefits will flow in as we already have a strong management team in place, he said.

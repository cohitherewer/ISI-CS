The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Sharp drop in tea exports
                                                                                                               Sharp drop in tea exports
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Calcutta, May 20: Indias tea exports during the first quarter of 2009 has dropped 23.65 per cent because of the global downturn and a shortfall in domestic output.         
	Statistics of the Indian Tea Association showed that the countrys total tea exports stood at 38.9 million kg during the January-March period against 50.9 million kg in the year-ago period.         
	Production during the period fell 9 per cent to 81.9 million kg from 89.9 million kg a year ago.        
	One main reason is that there is no supply. Production in India in the last three months has gone down because of drought and related weather problems, and there is demand in the domestic market also, a senior official of the Tea Board said.        
	Exports from north India fell 34 per cent to 19.94 million kg, while that from south India fell 8 per cent to 18.96 million kg.        
	India exports CTCs mainly to Egypt, Pakistan and the UK and premium orthodox to Iraq, Iran and Russia.        
	Global export fell 10.09 per cent during January-March to 184.3 million kg from 205 million kg a year ago. Only Kenya posted an increase of 2.91 per cent at 60 million kg against 58.3 million kg during the period.        
	However, exports are expected to improve in the coming months because of increased orders from Iran, Iraq and Egypt.         
	A shortfall in overall output of key producing countries such as Kenya and Sri Lanka is also expected to fuel exports from the country.

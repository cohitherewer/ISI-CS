The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | RIL threatens to pull out of oil hunt
                                                                                                               RIL threatens to pull out of oil hunt
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                          
	New Delhi, Oct. 6: Reliance Industries today urged the government to grant a three-year moratorium on drilling operations in deepwater blocks and threatened to pull out of exploration in 14 blocks if the promised extension was not granted.        
	Exploration firms such as RIL and ONGC want a moratorium as they are facing a shortage of drilling rigs as countries across the globe have stepped up oil and gas hunt after the surge in crude prices to $145 a barrel in June last year. Day-hire charges for a deep-sea drill rig have shot up since last year.        
	The petroleum ministry today reviewed the minimum drilling commitment of exploration firms as stipulated in the oil hunt contract before taking a view on moving a cabinet note on extending the tax holiday on drilling activities.         
	In January, the Empowered Committee of Secretaries had approved a drilling holiday for 33 blocks awarded in the fifth round of oil hunt. The drilling moratorium would apply to 15 of ONGCs blocks, 14 with Reliance and one with ENI of Italy.         
	While making the presentation, RIL officials had reportedly threatened to pull out of exploration in 14 blocks. The company is struggling to meet the contract commitment between 2006 and 2009 because of rig shortage, sources said.        
	According to sources, RIL said if the promised drilling holiday till December 2010 was not cleared it would pull out of the blocks. However, RIL declined to comment.         
	In 2003, RIL paid about $1,10,000-$1,15,000 per day for the rig that helped it discover the KG-D6 fields. For the same rig today, RIL is paying $5,50,000-$8,00,000 a day.        
	Between 2006 and 2009, the 14 deepwater blocks of RIL suffered because of rig shortage though the company spent $2 billion on drilling against a commitment of $0.8 billion.        
	During the period, RIL drilled 13 wells and now needs 40-45 rig months to achieve the committed 25 more wells.        
	In August last year, the petroleum ministry had moved the cabinet for a drilling holiday but the proposal was withdrawn after the finance ministry wanted a system of incentives and disincentives introduced to reward and punish companies performance during the period.        
	However, some members of Parliament had urged Prime Minister Manmohan Singh not to grant a blanket extension at the cost of the countrys energy security. They quoted reports that said operators themselves were renting out the rigs to others.        
	The petroleum ministry wants to ensure that the E amp;P firms demands are genuine.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                            
	Calcutta, Dec. 8: The government may fall well short of the capacity addition target for renewable energy in the Eleventh Five Year Plan (2007-12).         
	The capacity addition target for renewable energy was 14,000 MW in the Eleventh Plan. But we may not achieve this, said Dipak Gupta, principal secretary in the ministry of new and renewable energy .         
	Around 10,000 MW capacity creation was supposed to come from wind power, but a number of projects didnt materialise because of the financial crisis. However, the ministry is working on a new incentive scheme to attract entrepreneurs setting up wind power mills. Hopefully, we shall be able to reduce the shortfall once the incentive scheme takes effect, he said.        
	The ministry of new and renewable energy has targeted 1,300 MW fresh solar energy capacity in three years.         
	This is our initial step. Depending on this, well chalk out our future course. We have a solar mission which envisages 20,000 MW solar energy capacity by 2022, said Farooq Abdullah, minister for new and renewable energy.         
	He was speaking at the inauguration of a 10 MW bio-mass power plant set up by Amrit Bio Energy amp; Industries Ltd at Bankura.

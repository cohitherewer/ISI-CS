The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | SBI rate review after meet with Pranab
                                                                                                               SBI rate review after meet with Pranab
                            
	New Delhi, May 29 (PTI): The State Bank of India, the countrys largest lender, today said it would consider a cut in interest rates after the bankers meeting with finance minister Pranab Mukherjee early next month.        
	As far as interest rates are concerned, we will take a view after the meeting with the finance minister, SBI chairman .P. Bhatt said.        
	There is enough liquidity. Credit is not strong at this point of time but it is expected to pick up during the year, he said.        
	There is definitely a softening bias (on interest rates). There is no chance of going up, he said, adding that perhaps they (interest rates) would come down.        
	Falling inflation and sufficient liquidity present a strong case for a rate cut. How much it will fall and to what extent would depend on the products mix and balance between asset and liability, Bhatt said.        
	Earlier this week, Mukherjee had said that he would ask banks for a benign plan of action.         
	According to the finance minister, Industry and business have been hurt by the cost of finance ... the cost and the speed with which finance can be accessed remain a matter of concern.        
	One of the first steps I propose to take is to meet bankers and get them committed to a more benign plan of action, Mukherjee said.                           
	SBI last reduced the benchmark lending rate by 75 basis points to 12.75 per cent beginning this year. At the same time, the bank is offering home loans at a rate of 8 per cent.

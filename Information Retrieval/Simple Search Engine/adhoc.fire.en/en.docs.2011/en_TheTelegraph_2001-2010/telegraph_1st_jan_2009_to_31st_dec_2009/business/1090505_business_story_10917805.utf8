The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Tatas pick up more shares of Orient
                                                                                                               Tatas pick up more shares of Orient
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          STOCK TWIST                                  
	Mumbai, May 4: The Tatas have scooped up another 2.25 million shares in Orient-Express, the Bermuda-based luxury hotel and leisure travel business that they have stalked since August 2007.        
	The shares form part of a fresh flotation of Class A shares by Orient-Express which closes later today in New York. Deutsche Bank Securities is the sole bookrunner to the offering. The luxury hotel chain, which has suffered losses amid a recession in the West, is offering 22.5 million shares at just $5.75 per share.        
	In its prospectus to the issue, Orient-Express said its net loss for the first quarter ended March 31 was expected to be $14.6 million compared with a net loss of $4.3 million in the same period of 2008.        
	The Tatas, who once held as much as 11.5 per cent of the Orient-Express equity, will see their stake fall to 9.7 per cent after the fresh issue of shares. It could go down a little more if the underwriters to the issue exercised the option to purchase another 3.37 million shares.        
	The Tata group has tapped a $51-million loan from ICICI Bank UK to finance the share purchase. The loan has been taken by a group subsidiary called Samsara Properties which is based in the British Virgin Islands.        
	Interest on the loan will accrue on a daily basis at a rate of Libor plus 4 per cent.         
	The purchase of the 2.25 million shares will cost $12.94 million.        
	However, it wasnt immediately clear why the group had borrowed $51 million from ICICI Bank. The speculation is that the Tatas may start buying more Orient-Express stock on the New York Stock Exchange where the company is listed.        
	The Tatas said they were buying the shares to remain a significant shareholder of the company.        
	Orient-Express had fobbed off an overture by the Tatas for a hotel alliance in December 2007, which sparked an angry exchange of words between Orient-Express CEO Paul White and R. Krishna Kumar, vice-chairman of Indian Hotels.        
	At the height of the battle, the Tatas had bought Orient shares at close to $60 a share; the latest offering at $5.75 a share is an indication of how badly the recession has roiled loss-laden Orients stock. It will also help lower the Tatas acquisition costs.        
	The Tatas had invested about $300 million to pick up the 11.5 per cent stake in 2007.

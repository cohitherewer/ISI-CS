The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Satyam kicks off stake sale   Floor price for auction waived
                                                                                                               Satyam kicks off stake sale 
  Floor price for auction waived          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                                   
	Mumbai, March 9: Satyam Computer Services today invited bids for a 51 per cent stake in the scam-scarred software maker after capital market watchdog Sebi waived the mandatory floor price for the auction.  
	Under a three-stage process, investors will have to express their interest in bidding by March 12. They will then receive a document outlining the modalities of the exercise. The interested players will have to make a detailed bid by March 20 after showing clear proof that they have funds worth at least Rs 1,500 crore (or $290 million).        
	Larsen amp; Toubro (L amp;T) and B.K. Modis Spice Group said they would register their interest in the bidding process. The Hindujas are expected to do the same.        
	L amp;T already has a 12 per cent stake in the company and its stake will probably halve after Satyam expands its equity base by 31 per cent through the issue of new shares.        
	It is not possible for us to say that we will bid at any cost, Y.M. Deosthalee, chief financial officer of L amp;T told a television channel.        
	We havent taken a call yet. We will evaluate our options, Prabal Banerji, chief financial officer of the Hinduja group, told The Telegraph.        
	Other possible bidders include Tech Mahindra and Fujitsu though it was not immediately clear whether they would toss their hats into the ring.        
	Analysts said Sebis decision to waive a floor price would stoke a lot of interest.        
	Satyam said the shortlisted bidders would gain access to certain business, financial and legal diligence materials. However, bidders will have to sign a non-disclosure and non-solicitation pact. In other words, they will not be allowed to put these details in the public domain or solicit business from the clients of Satyam.        
	New auditors, including KPMG and Deloitte, have started work on a long-drawn process to restate the companys accounts over several years after founder B. Ramalinga Raju admitted on January 7 to a Rs 7,136-crore fraud by padding the books.         
	The bidders will not have a clear idea about Satyams liabilities when they stump up their bids.        
	The Hyderabad-based company said the bidders would have to execute a standstill agreement under which they could neither buy nor sell Satyam shares during bidding. In addition, they will have to give a no-claims undertaking, which will effectively bar them from seeking compensation from either the government or the company for any losses arising from any unforeseen liabilities.        
	Satyam is embroiled in class action suits filed by its shareholders based in the US. The winning bidder will have to assume liability for any court-sanctioned claims.        
	After the bidders complete the due diligence process, they will submit their financial bids. Satyam will then select the successful bidder. The chosen entity will have four days to deposit with the company the entire subscription amount and the requisite funds for the open offer in an escrow account.        
	After acquiring a 31 per cent stake in the company, the winning bidder will have to make an open offer to the public for 20 per cent of the equity at the same price. If the response to the open offer is lukewarm and the investor acquires less than 51 per cent, Satyam will give the bidder the option to subscribe to new shares to reach the 51-per-cent-mark.        
	Sources said the expressions of interest might not translate into final bids. The bidders may submit an expression of interest.         
	A final bid will happen after they get some clarity on Satyams financial position and the extent of its liabilities. Some may prefer not to make the final bid, a source said.        
	Satyam shares climbed 15.8 per cent to close at Rs 48.75 on the Bombay Stock Exchange today. However, L amp;T fell 3.2 per cent to Rs 561.80.         
	Raju with CBI        
	A Hyderabad court today sent Raju, his brother Rama Raju and three others to CBI custody for seven days from tomorrow.         
	Besides the Raju brothers, the CBI would be quizzing Satyams former CFO Vadlamani Srinivas and audit house Price Waterhouses partners S. Gopalakrishnan and Talluri Srinivas.

	New Delhi, Aug. 26: A stuttering refinery sector has yanked core sector growth down to just 1.8 per cent in July, the lowest for the fiscal.        
	Analysts said the demand for industrial goods was likely to weaken in the coming months because of the below-normal monsoon affecting rural demand.        
	Refinery growth shrunk 14.4 per cent in July against a growth rate of 11.8 per cent a year ago.         
	The six core industries grew 5.1 per cent in July 2007.        
	The coal sector grew 9.7 per cent against 5.5 per cent a year ago, electricity, 3.3 per cent (4.5 per cent), cement, 10.6 per cent (5.5 per cent) and finished steel, 1.2 per cent (6 per cent).        
	However, the core sector, which accounts for a quarter of the countrys industrial production, grew 4.1 per cent during April-July.        
	The numbers indicate volatility in industrial production. The upswing in production in June could be because of the general elections, D.K. Joshi, principal economist with rating agency Crisil, said.

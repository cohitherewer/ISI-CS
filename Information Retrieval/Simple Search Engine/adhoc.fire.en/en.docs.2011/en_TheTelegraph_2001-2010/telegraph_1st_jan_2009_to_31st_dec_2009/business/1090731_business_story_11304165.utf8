The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | GDR twist to gas tussle   Spotlight on RNRL document
                                                                                                               GDR twist to gas tussle     Spotlight on RNRL document
          R. SURYAMURTHY                                                  
	New Delhi, July 30: The paper chase has begun.        
	Legal eagles representing the government believe they have clinching evidence to show that Anil Ambani and his company, Reliance Natural Resources Ltd (RNRL), knew all along that the government will have the final say in the pricing of gas from the Krishna-Godavari basin.        
	In the scramble to put together their evidences before the Supreme Court starts hearing the Ambani gas case on September 1, official sources believe they have hit pay dirt with the admissions that RNRL made in its offer document relating to the global depositary receipts (GDRs) in August 2006.        
	In the GDR offer document, sources said, RNRL made two clear admissions: first, the price of gas to be supplied by RIL from the KG basin was subject to approval from the government and, second, it could not sell the gas to any third party except to its own group firms.        
	RNRL has moved the apex court seeking the implementation of the Bombay High Court order directing RIL owned by Mukesh Ambani to sell 28 million cubic metres of gas per day at $2.34 per million British thermal unit for 17 years under the terms of a family agreement that served as the basis for the carve-up of the Reliance empire.        
	Sources said RNRL had clearly said in the GDR offer document that the gas supplied could not be used for trading, other than trading within the Reliance ADA group.        
	They said, RNRL does not have any power plant or other units which can consume the gas. If it wants the gas for trading with third parties, it would be a clear violation of what it had stated in the GDR document.        
	However, this is expected to raise a major quibble because the document goes on to say the swapping of gas will be permitted.        
	While listing the points of disagreements with the gas supply master agreement (GSMA) that RIL signed with RNRL in January 2006 when both companies were under the control of Mukesh Ambani, the GDR offer document says: RNRL believes that the agreed position is that it is entitled to enter into swaps in relation to the gas to be supplied under the GSMA.        
	It goes on to state: However, the GSMA imposes a total restriction on direct or indirect trading, even within the Reliance ADA group.        
	Interestingly, the government has already earned $2.47 million as its first profit share in the first quarter of this fiscal from KG-D6 operator RIL and Niko Resources.        
	RIL, which holds a 90 per cent stake in KG-D6, paid $2.47 million, while the Canadian firm paid $274,767 in profit petroleum for the April-June quarter, officials said.        
	Petition revised        
	The government today filed a revised special leave petition through which it asked the Supreme Court to declare null and void all provisions relating to the gas deal in the family pact.         
	Earlier, it had asked for the entire memorandum of understanding to be declared null and void.

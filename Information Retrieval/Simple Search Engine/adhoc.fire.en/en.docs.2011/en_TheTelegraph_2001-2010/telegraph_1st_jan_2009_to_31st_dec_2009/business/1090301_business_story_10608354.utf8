          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Kumar: New role                                  
	New Delhi, Feb. 28: The government today appointed former World Bank executive Dhanendra Kumar as chairman of the competition commission.        
	The commission was set up in 2003 and would replace the Monopolies and Restrictive Trade Practices Commission.        
	The commission will keep an eye on airlines to see if they are resorting to cartelisation while fixing fares, check whether companies are passing on the benefits of tax cuts to consumers or are resorting to unfair trade measures. It is likely to keenly track the Satyam bidding process too.        
	The watchdog will follow mergers and acquisitions of telecom firms that have recently bagged licences to offer GSM services. Some of them have sold stakes to multinationals at huge profit.        
	The law empowers the commission to block takeovers by multinationals as well as large mergers and acquisitions by Indian firms, if it feels this could affect competition in the market.        
	We will ensure that we have the best global practices to promote a level-playing field, Kumar told reporters after taking the oath, which was administered by minister of corporate affairs Prem Chand Gupta. The minister also administered the oath of office to H. C. Gupta as a member of the commission.        
	The chairman said the focus of the commission would be on sectors which were consumer-oriented. The commission will ensure that the benefits of the stimulus packages reach the consumers, Kumar said.        
	Three other members will be inducted soon. One member would be from the judiciary, one from the income tax department and the third member would be another professional, an official said.        
	The CCI has powers to investigate suspected cartels and order them to desist from price hikes or other monopoly practices.

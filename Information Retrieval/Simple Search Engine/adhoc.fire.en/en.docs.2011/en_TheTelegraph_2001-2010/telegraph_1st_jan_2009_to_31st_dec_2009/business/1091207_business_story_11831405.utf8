	New Delhi, Dec. 6: Railway minister Mamata Banerjees development blitz is set to touch Bangladesh.        
	When Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina Wajed comes calling later this month, India will make a slew of proposals to strengthen the rail network of its eastern neighbour.        
	The bouquet for Hasina includes an upgraded station at the Indian border town of Bongaon to facilitate the movement of people and trade, a link to Tripuras Agartala and access to Nepal through three points. I share a special relationship with Sheikh Hasina. We will of course be meeting when the Prime Minister comes on her state visit, Mamata said.         
	The railway minister said she had ordered a Rs 17-crore upgrade of the Bongaon station. We will also build the Akhuara-Agartala railway to link Bangladesh with the Northeast.         
	Besides the personal meeting of the two ladies, Indian officials will hold talks to finalise railway co-operation with Bangladesh.         
	Railway officials said survey work for the link between Tripura and Bangladesh had been completed, and work on the line would start soon.         
	Links restored        
	Bangladesh and India had renewed rail links a year-and-a-half back, some 43 years after the ties got snapped in the aftermath of the India-Pakistan war in 1965. Bangladesh was then a part of Pakistan.         
	Top railway officials said India is committed to giving Bangladesh trade and people-to-people access to its Northeast, and the railway will go a long way in doing just that.        
	India will also give Bangladesh access to Nepal through three points  Birol-Radhikapur, Rahanpur-Singabad and Chilahati-Haldibari. This has been a longstanding demand of Dhaka, which wants to not only expand trade with Nepal but also wants the Himalayan nation to use its ports.         
	Bangladesh will also gain access to Bhutan once a proposed line from India to Bhutan is completed. The line will start from Hashimara in Bengal and go through Satali, Bharnobari and Dalsinghpara to Turibari in Bhutan, which does not have a network. RITES Ltd  a company in railway technology  is expected to come up with plans for the Bhutan project.         
	Initially, the railway was from Hashimara to Phuentsholing. However, as the Bhutanese border town suffers from heavy congestion, it was decided to have a new route.         
	Bangladesh is believed to be keen on setting up a wagon factory with Indian assistance. India may offer the public-private-participation route for the factory, besides technology transfer.         
	Indias eastern neighbour has a rail network of about 2,700 kms, with just about 923 kms of broad gauge rails. Bangladesh wants to upgrade this entire system to broad gauge.

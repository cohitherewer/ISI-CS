The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Maintenance fee
                                                                                                                 Q amp;A      Maintenance fee
                                I bought a flat in a complex in Howrah. The association has drawn up a rule charging 50 per cent more maintenance fee from owners who let out their flats. Is this legal for a non-government society? What to do?          A. Upadhay, Howrah
                There are non-occupancy clauses in many cooperative housing societies. However, the maximum service fee a cooperative housing society can charge varies from state to state. For example, in Maharashtra, the non-occupancy charge cannot be more than 10 per cent. So, you will have to check the by-laws of your housing society. But it is unlikely that the maximum non-occupancy charge will be 50 per cent. You can take some legal opinion before approaching the housing society with your complaints.                                  Senior query      I shall be 65-years-old on January 15, 2010. When and which form, 15G or 15H, should I need to submit to my bank to claim non-deduction of tax at source on interest income? If my annual income is below the basic exemption limit should I submit the income tax return?        Sada Nanda Mandal, Shyamnagar
                    You shall be able to claim the tax benefits of a senior citizen in financial year 2009-10 and not before that. For the current financial year, youll have to submit Form 15G. From next year, you can submit Form 15H. It is not mandatory to file income tax return if your annual income is less than the basic exemption limit.                                  Gift dilemma      Under which clause of the Income Tax Act, is exemption of tax towards gift specified? What is the maximum amount an income tax assessee can gift in a financial year? Does gifts to parents attract tax?        Tulsidas Chakrabarti, Behala
                    Gift tax was abolished in October 1998. However, it was brought back in Budget 2004, under which the recipient of a gift will be taxed. There is no maximum limit on how much one can gift to close relatives, that is lineal ascendants and descendants, and there is no tax, irrespective of the amount of gifted to a close relative, including parents.

	New Delhi, Nov. 20: Rolls-Royce Motor Cars today gave a glimpse of its four-door Ghost, which will sport a price tag of Rs 2.5 crore.         
	Production of the Ghost has begun in Goodwood, United Kingdom, and the first cars are expected to reach customers in India by the second quarter of 2010.        
	The company hopes to increase sales by nearly four times. We sold 20 cars from our Phantom family last year in India. This year, sales will be lower than last year thanks to recession, but in 2010 we hope to sell about 75 units. Of this, anywhere between 40-60 units will be the Ghost, Colin Kelly, regional director (Asia-Pacific), told The Telegraph.        
	Though the base price of the Ghost is Rs 2.5 crore (ex-showroom, Delhi), Rolls-Royce said prices would go up depending on changes demanded by a customer.        
	With a 6.6-litre twin-turbo charged V12 petrol engine and a new eight-speed automatic gearbox, the sedan promises to reach a speed of 100 kmph in flat 4.9 seconds.        
	Kelly said: Though smaller than the Phantom line-up of cars, it is very fuel efficient.        
	The Ghost comes with an optional panorama sunroof, which extends from the front into the rear compartment.        
	Four-zone automatic air-conditioning and air recirculation, picnic tables, seats made of the finest leather, with two 9.2-inch LCD screens are the other features.        
	Rolls-Royce has already received 25 bookings for the Ghost.        
	The company had globally sold 1,212 cars last year. This year, it is looking to more than double its sales. We are looking for sales of 2,500 units globally in 2010, of which two-thirds are expected to come from the Ghost, said Brenda Pek, Rolls-Royce general manager (south and east Asia Pacific).        
	Everybody is keeping an eye on India. It is a key market for us. Brenda said.

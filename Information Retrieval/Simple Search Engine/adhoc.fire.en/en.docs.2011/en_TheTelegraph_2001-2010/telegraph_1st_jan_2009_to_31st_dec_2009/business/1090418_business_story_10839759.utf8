          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Ready reckoner                                  
	Mumbai, April 17: Individuals will soon get to know their creditworthiness from Credit Information Bureau of India Ltd (Cibil), a repository of credit records of 13.5 crore commercial and individual borrowers.        
	Cibil today got an in-principle approval for certificate of registration from the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), enabling the five-year-old firm to offer its services to consumers and industries such as telecommunications and insurance.        
	Arun Thukral, managing director of Cibil, said they would start catering to consumers from the next fiscal at attractive rates.        
	At present, only banks and financial institutions avail themselves of the services of Cibil on a reciprocal basis, meaning only those who give their credit data can tap the organisation for information.        
	The key service is the credit score of borrowers, a single number derived from their repayment records on all types of loans.        
	A borrower is rated between 300 and 999, with 300 the lowest score.         
	The main advantage for individuals is that they will be in a position to leverage their credit scores and negotiate better interest deals for loans from banks.        
	Besides, there will be greater awareness on credit procedures and higher credit penetration.        
	Thukral said the RBI approval was a significant step and will enable us to provide services to other industry verticals such as telecommunications and insurance, and to consumers in the near future.        
	We will have to first build a separate platform and process for the consumer. Moreover, we also need to have a foolproof system in place with adequate checks and balances. This will take six to nine months to organise, he added.        
	In addition to Cibil, three other entities  Equifax Credit Information Services, Experian Credit Information Company of India and Highmark Credit Information Services  today received approval from the RBI.

	March 26: Prime Minister Manmohan Singh said today the economy would grow by 6.5-7 per cent in the current fiscal.        
	This is the first time that anyone in authority has put a number lower than the advance estimate of 7.1 per cent put out by the Central Statistical Organisation (CSO) late last year.        
	Singh, however, said the country was in no danger of slipping into a deflationary phase. I dont see India in danger of deflation (a phase marked by persistent and sustained economic downturn, he told reporters in Delhi.        
	There were clear signs that the economy had started to stutter after the global economic slowdown. But until now, no one has tried to outguess the CSO.        
	When stand-in finance minister Pranab Mukherjee presented the interim budget, he trotted out the CSO figure. A healthy 7.1 per cent rate of GDP growth still makes India the second fastest growing economy in the world, Mukherjee had said.        
	Experts had seen signs of trouble when the third quarter (October-December) GDP growth slowed to 5.3 per cent over the year-ago period. Many reckoned that the economy would have to grow by 7.5 per cent in the fourth quarter (JanuaryMarch) to achieve an overall growth of 7.1 per cent. This was always going to be difficult.        
	Reserve Bank governor Duvvuri Subbarao was the first to admit that growth might fall short of 7.1 per cent at a recent meet in Tokyo but didnt hazard a figure.                    Singh: Upbeat      
	Subbarao today said that growth might slow further in the next financial year  2009-10. Growth moderation is steeper than what we earlier thought. I believe 2009-10 is going to be more challenging than 2008-09, he said.        
	Addressing the CIIs annual conclave, Subbarao said, It is not clear when the global recovery will begin but when it does, Indias recovery will be sharper and swifter than elsewhere in the world. He said a third stimulus package to jumpstart the economy would put pressure on the credit markets. The previous two stimulus packages and duty cuts last month should be given time to show results, he added.        
	Meanwhile, Suresh D. Tendulkar, chairman of the economic advisory council to the Prime Minister, told reporters in Calcutta that the economy would bounce back in the next 3-6 months.        
	Tendulkar told members of the Merchants Chamber of Commerce that three factors would spur the economy: the monetary and fiscal measures that had already been announced, robust domestic demand, and the low interest regime adopted by banks.

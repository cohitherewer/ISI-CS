The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Tata Steel splits top job
                                                                                                               Tata Steel splits top job
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              Adams amp; Nerurkar: Chosen ones				                                 
	Calcutta, Sept. 30: Tata Steel today restructured its top management by creating a post of managing director for Coruss operations in Europe.        
	As B. Muthuraman, managing director of unified Tata Steel Group, stepped down from his post today, the company decided to split his responsibilities between Kirby Adams, CEO of Corus, and Hemant Nerurkar, CEO and executive director of Tata Steel India and South East Asia.        
	Both Adams and Nerurkar have been redesignated as managing director of Tata Steel Europe and Tata Steel (which also includes the operations of Singapores Natsteel and Tata Steel Thailand), respectively.        
	Muthuraman will continue to be on the board of Tata Steel as the non-executive vice-chairman, the company board, which met in Mumbai today, said.        
	Tata Steels management structure would be similar to that of Tata Motors, where Prakash Telang is the managing director of the Indian operations. Ravi Kant, Tata Motors erstwhile managing director and now vice-chairman, continues to look after the overseas business. Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) has its own CEO David Smith, while Jaguar and Land Rover, independently, have two managing directors.        
	Sources said the group wanted to keep both Muthuraman and Kant busy as they oversaw two major acquisitions  Corus and JLR. Both Telang and Nerurkar are being made responsible for the local operations, dissociating them from JLR and Corus, respectively.        
	In Tata Steel, Nerurkar will be expected to maintain the profitability of the Indian operations, ensure that the greenfield project in Orissa took off and the south east Asian business remained on track.        
	Adams joined Corus from Bluescope Steel of Australia when Philip Varin, the former CEO of Corus and a potential candidate for the post of managing director, left. Adams will have to manage the downturn in Europe, check losses, win over confrontational employees and create a long-term sustainable model.        
	Tata Steel Group had plunged into a Rs 2,209-crore consolidated loss (European, Indian and Southeast Asian operations combined) in the first quarter compared with a profit of Rs 3,901 crore a year ago. However, Tata Steel on a standalone basis (Indian operations) posted a profit of Rs 1,193 crore, down from Rs 2,578 crore in the same period last year.

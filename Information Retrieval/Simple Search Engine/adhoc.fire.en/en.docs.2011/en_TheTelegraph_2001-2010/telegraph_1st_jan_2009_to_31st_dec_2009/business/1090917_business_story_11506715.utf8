                                                                                                               Market buzz on Reliance treasury stock sale gets louder
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                            
	Mumbai, Sept. 16: The market is abuzz with news that Reliance Industries has finally decided to monetise part of its treasury stock.         
	Reliance Petroleum Trust, which holds around 6.5 per cent of RIL, is close to selling around one crore shares of RIL at over Rs 2,100 per share.        
	The petroleum trust, an entity controlled by Reliance, holds 10.46 crore shares of RIL.         
	Sources said around one crore shares would be sold to a clutch of financial investors and the holder had an option of selling an additional one crore shares.         
	The total proceeds from the sale is, therefore, expected to be over Rs 4,000 crore and it could be used by the company to invest in its existing businesses or to retire part of its debt.        
	If market speculation is to be believed, the Mukesh Ambani company has mandated Citibank and Bank of America Merrill Lynch to sell a total of two crore shares and the deal could be announced within the next couple of days.        
	When contacted, a spokesperson for Reliance denied that the trust sold any RIL shares. He, however, did not comment on whether the RIL arm was planning to monetise part of its holding.         
	A treasury stock is created when a company acquires its own stock because of a merger with a group firm.        
	The petroleum trust was formed in May 2002 by Reliance Industrial Investments amp; Holdings, a wholly owned subsidiary of RIL, after the merger of Reliance Petroleum (RPL) with Reliance.        
	As Reliance Industrial Investments, which held RPL shares, could not keep shares of the parent company, the petroleum trust was formed to hold these shares.         
	Following a merger of Indian Petrochemicals Corporation Ltd (IPCL) with RIL, the amount of treasury stock swelled.         
	However, during the recent merger of RPL with RIL, the company decided not to create any additional treasury stock and it cancelled its holding in RPL.         
	Rumours of RILs plan to monetise part of its treasury stock had been doing the rounds for several years. However, this is the first time that the Mukesh Ambani company may have actually decided to do so.         
	The ICICI group and the UB group have monetised their treasury stock in the past.        
	The Reliance scrip closed at Rs 2,183.50 on the BSE today. Therefore, at current market prices, the total value of the entire treasury stock held by Reliance Petroleum Trust is nearly Rs 23,000 crore.

	New Delhi, Feb. 18 (PTI): The Lok Sabha will discuss the state of affairs at Satyam tomorrow.        
	At a business advisory committee meeting today, leaders of various political parties agreed to deliberate on the Rs 7,100-crore fraud that has tarnished Indias image.        
	The discussion was listed for February 13 but was deferred following a request from Opposition leader L. K. Advani.        
	CBI special team        
	The CBI, which has taken over the probe, will set up a multi-dimensional investigating team and expects to file a case soon.        
	A Hyderabad court today dismissed the bail petitions of the Raju brothers and former Satyam CFO V. Srinivas. The court also granted permission to the tax department to examine and record the statement of Satyam founder B. Ramalinga Raju.        
	The 6th additional chief metropolitan magistrate, which dismissed the petitions, also allowed market regulator Sebi to quiz Price Waterhouse auditors S. Gopala-krishnan and T. Srinivas tomorrow between 10.30am and 4.30pm inside the Chanchalguda jail.        
	Meanwhile, the restatement of accounts of Satyam could take more than six months as the entire process was complicated, according to audit firm KPMG, who, along with Deloitte, has been mandated for the job.

	Mumbai, Nov. 26: Tata Steel, the worlds eighth-largest steel maker, suffered a consolidated net loss of Rs 2,707 crore for the second quarter as Anglo-Dutch subsidiary Corus continued to drag down the companys profitability. Weak steel prices also contributed to the mounting losses.        
	The company has suffered a net loss of Rs 4,916 crore in the first half of the current fiscal compared with a net profit of Rs 8,673 crore in the corresponding period of the last year. The net loss for the quarter was higher than what the Street expected and the Tata Steel scrip plummeted by 3.34 per cent on the Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) to Rs 543.45 on Thursday.        
	The net loss  after minority interest and share of profit of associates  for the quarter ended September 30, 2009, at Rs 2,707.25 crore is higher than the loss posted in the first quarter of this fiscal. Tata Steel suffered a net loss of Rs 2,209 crore in the quarter ended June 30, 2009.        
	Net sales in the second quarter stood at Rs 25,269 crore compared with Rs 23,180 crore in the first quarter of this fiscal, an increase of 9 per cent. Tata Steel posted net sales of Rs 44,050 crore and a net profit of Rs 4,771 crore in the second quarter of 2008-09.        
	In the half year ended September 30, 2009, Tata Steel posted net sales of Rs 48,450 crore compared with Rs 87,425 crore in the corresponding period of the last year.        
	Tata Steel group CFO Koushik Chatterjee laid out the roadmap for further debt restructuring for the company that spent $12.9 billion to buy Corus in 2007.         
	Chatterjee said the company had a gross debt of $12.9 billion at the end of September and it planned to bring this down by $2 billion in the medium term. The company has cash of over $2 billion and plans to pre-pay $180 million of debt before March, Chatterjee said.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Calcutta, April 3: US-based Databazaar Group has forayed into Bengali film production with Soumitra Chatterjee starrer Dwando.        
	The film is being directed by award-winner Suman Ghosh under the banner of Suman Ghosh Productions.         
	Databazaar, which is based in Florida, has picked up a 70 per cent interest in the film.         
	It has multiple lines of business, including Internet retail, wholesale distribution, software development, and legal and business process outsourcing with an annual turnover of around Rs 360 crore. We are also the underwriter of the project, meaning any overages and incidentals are picked up by us, Oney Seal, CEO of Databazaar, said.         
	The film is set for global release during the year. LongTail, the second largest film distribution house in Hollywood, is likely to take up the world distribution rights of the movie.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | No deduction
                                                                                                                 Q amp;A      No deduction
                                I am 72-years-old and my annual income is Rs 1.5 lakh. I have an NSS account for the last 15 years with the GPO. If I withdraw the full amount from the account, including an interest of Rs 50,000, will there be any tax deduction?           Subhendu Chatterjee, Howrah
                    ior citizens having no taxable income can submit Form 15H with a self declaration and there will be no tax deduction at source on the NSS maturity. Since your total annual income is less than the threshold limit of Rs 2.40 lakh, there will be no deduction at source.                                     Agent anxiety      I am an insurance agent. The company deducted tax at source from my commission income at the rate of 10 per cent. To get back refund of my TDS, I am supposed to file income tax returns. What is the maximum expense I can claim as deduction without keeping books of accounts?         Chetan Sahu, Asansol
                    If your annual income is up to Rs 60,000, you may claim 33.33 per cent deduction from your income as expenses. You are not required to keep any book of accounts except From 16A received from the insurance company. You should file your income return in ITR 4 and there you can show your income under the head Income from Business/Profession.                                   Share sale      I bought some shares ten years ago. I have no demat account. How can I sell these shares? How much tax do I pay?        Rima Sarkar, Hooghly
                    To sell those shares you shall have to open a demat and a trading account with a brokerage house. A demat account can also be opened with a scheduled commercial bank. Once the demat account is opened, convert the paper scrips into dematerialised form. The dematerialised shares then can be sold through a brokerage house registered with the BSE or the NSE. Since you are holding these stocks for more than a year, there will be no capital gains tax if those shares are sold through a recognised stock exchange.

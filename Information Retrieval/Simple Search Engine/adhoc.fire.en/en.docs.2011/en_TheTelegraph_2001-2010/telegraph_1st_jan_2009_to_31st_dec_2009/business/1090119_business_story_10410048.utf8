The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Plan to limit Satyam scam onus   Immunity hope for independent directors
                                                                                                               Plan to limit Satyam scam onus
   Immunity hope for independent directors
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                           Gupta: Tough stand                                        
	New Delhi, Jan. 18: The government is unlikely to prosecute either the erstwhile independent directors on the Satyam board or the auditors Price Waterhouse.         
	However, it will file cases against the promoters as well as its key employees if they are found to have been abetting the accounting fraud.         
	Board minutes of Satyams crucial December 16 meeting  which was published first in The Telegraph  seem to reveal that independent directors were not mute spectators to the wrongdoings.         
	Besides, officials in the corporate affairs ministry said the independent directors had limited roles and their fault was one of oversight and not connivance.         
	However, there will not be any carte blanche immunity from legal proceedings against anyone, officials said. All decisions would depend on investigations, which are in progress.         
	As the Companies Act stands today, there is no such thing called independent directors and there is no immunity, corporate affairs minister P. C. Gupta told reporters.         
	At present, Parliament is studying an overhaul of the Companies Act. The aim is to impose limited liability on independent directors according to their decision-making powers.         
	Gupta said, Independent directors in accordance with the Companies Act 2008, will not be held responsible for the wrongdoings of the company, if they are not party to that decision.         
	The concept of independent directors in India first came up in a set of failed amendments to the companies act. The issue was again raised when Sebi revised its corporate governance norms on the recommendations of a high-powered committee headed by Infosys mentor Narayana Murthy.         
	The securities regulator had asked companies to increase the number of independent directors on their board.         
	According to the Sebi norm, if the chairman of the board is a non-executive member, at least a third of the directors should be independent.        
	In other cases, independent directors should constitute at least half of the board.         
	Individual independent directors do not have enough knowledge of the functioning of a firm to be able to either check frauds perpetrated by the management or reverse decisions taken by the promoter or the majority group, corporate affairs ministry officials said.         
	They can resist patently wrong decisions by protesting them, making them public or by resigning. These directors did object to the Satyam-Maytas merger deal and did resign soon afterwards, officials said.                           
	One cannot expect individuals to detect complicated accounting frauds which analysts, auditors and even the registrar of companies could not detect, officials said.

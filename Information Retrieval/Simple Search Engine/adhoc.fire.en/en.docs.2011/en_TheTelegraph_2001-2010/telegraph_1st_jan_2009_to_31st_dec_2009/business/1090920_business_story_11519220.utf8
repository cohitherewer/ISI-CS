          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                                Finance minister Pranab Mukherjee with R. Seshasayee, former president of CII, in Bangalore on Saturday. (PTI)       
	Bangalore, Sept. 19: The government will wait and watch before deciding to roll back the stimulus packages that were announced after Indias economic growth slackened on account of the global financial crisis.        
	We will have to wait and watch the situation, finance minister Pranab Mukherjee told reporters on the timing of the reversal of the stimulus package.        
	Mukherjee said the international view was that the stimulus package should not be reversed till full recovery in Europe and North America was distinctly visible.         
	This view was expressed at a recent G20 meeting of finance ministers, Mukherjee told reporters after an interactive session organised by the CII on the proposed direct tax code.         
	The government had slashed excise duty by six per cent and service tax by two per cent in various phases and increased plan expenditure. This has stretched the fiscal deficit further.         
	The fiscal deficit is projected to rise to 6.8 per cent of GDP in 2009-10. The finance minister had earlier said this level of fiscal deficit couldnt be sustained and aimed to bring it down to 5.5 per cent next fiscal and to 4.4 per cent by 2011-12.        
	Austerity drive        
	The finance minister today said the governments austerity drive would not compromise on the security offered to individuals.        
	According to Mukherjee, steps like travelling by economy class was a drop in the ocean and it was necessary that all departments cut the non-plan expenditure by 10 per cent to result in any significant savings for the government.         
	Non-plan expenditure refers to the cost of running the government, including wages and interest payments.         
	Tax code        
	The minister also allayed concerns over the new direct tax code and said changes in the minimum alternate tax (MAT) was necessary to compensate for any revenue loss.         
	It must be remembered that the new tax code grandfathers the plethora of exemptions available under the old law. The revenue loss because of them will continue to be incurred for a decade or so. At least for this period, an additional revenue measure such as MAT is necessary for the government to meet its expenditure obligations, he said.

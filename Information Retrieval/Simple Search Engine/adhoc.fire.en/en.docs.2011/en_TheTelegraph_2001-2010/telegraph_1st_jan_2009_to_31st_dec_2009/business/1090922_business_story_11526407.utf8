The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Bharti-MTN talks in final lap
                                                                                                               Bharti-MTN talks in final lap
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      Clear Signal                          
	New Delhi, Sept. 21: Indian and South African government officials are expected to meet in the next two days to discuss the foreign exchange implications of the proposed merger between Bharti Airtel and MTN.        
	The talks will be held between finance ministry officials and representatives of the South African treasury department. Besides, South African treasury and central bank officials will deliberate with RBI officials on exchange control issues.         
	Top officials said clarifications were necessary in two areas  first, whether the money flow for the proposed swap deal is breaking any law and second, whether a dual listing of the merged telecom entity, which will be third largest in the world, is possible under Indian laws.        
	As far as we can understand, the deal, which is quite complex, does not contravene any Fema (Foreign Exchange Management Act) or other Indian laws, but a double check on the issues always helps, the officials said.         
	Finance minister Pranab Mukherjee has already been sounded out by his South African counterpart Pravin Gordhan on the hurdles, the officials said.        
	However, a more ticklish problem is dual listing of the merged entity, which the South Africans want. Indian corporate law is silent about dual listing and any changes can be a time-consuming and cumbersome process. The government may also not wish to trigger off amendments just for a single case.        
	The South Africans have sought no appointments with the officials of the ministry of corporate affairs.         
	Changes in corporate laws are the domain of the ministry, headed by Congress leader Salman Khursheed.        
	The rupee is not fully convertible which will make dual listing in two different currencies difficult to manage. Dual listing means that after the merger, the new companys shares will be listed in both the countries, allowing investors to buy shares in one country and sell in the other. Since the rupee is not convertible, this will be difficult.        
	However, compromises that do not involve legal changes are possible. Bharti and MTN shares can be traded in India and South Africa, respectively, while benefits such as dividends and bonuses distributed equally among the shareholders of the two companies. Several companies such as BHP Billiton and Rio Tinto follow this structure.

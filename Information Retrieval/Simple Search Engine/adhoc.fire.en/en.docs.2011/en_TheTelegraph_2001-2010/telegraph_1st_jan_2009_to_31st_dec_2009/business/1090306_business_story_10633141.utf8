The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Auditor gets its act together
                                                                                                               Auditor gets its act together
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Fresh start                                  
	Mumbai, March 5: Price Waterhouse, the auditor of scam-scarred Satyam Computer, is putting its house in order.        
	Price Waterhouse has come out with a five-point plan to deal with the crisis that has hurt the reputation of the well-known audit firm which has operated in India for over 125 years.        
	As a first step, the auditor is establishing an advisory board to provide guidance to the local leadership to help shape the firms strategy and action. This board will comprise five members. Four of them will come from outside the PricewaterhouseCoopers network. They will be leading individuals of repute and standing in India, the firm said in a statement issued today. The fifth member will be a senior partner from another PwC member firm.        
	The firm will also undertake a comprehensive review of its work and processes. It will appoint a new head of quality assurance and risk management. This person will be seconded to Price Waterhouse from another firm in the PwC network.         
	The local audit firm has appointed Sharmila Karve as the new leader of its national assurance practice. Karve has worked on a number of important clients handled by the firm. She has, in turn, appointed a new assurance leadership team to assist her in beefing up the assurance practice.        
	Finally, Price Waterhouses Hyderabad office  which managed the Satyam account since June 2000  will be placed under a new management. The two auditors who signed the Satyam accounts  S. Gopalakrishnan and Srinivas Talluri  will remain under suspension.        
	The problems at Satyam have created a difficult environment and, therefore, we are taking all steps to demonstrate to our clients and other stakeholders our commitment to the highest standards, Ramesh Rajan, chairman of Price Waterhouse India, said.        
	The firm remains keen to understand the nature of the fraud that took place at Satyam which was clearly designed to, and did, circumvent the audit process, he said.

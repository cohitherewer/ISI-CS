The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Slowdown no bar to foreign investment
                                                                                                               Slowdown no bar to foreign investment
          JAYATI GHOSE                              
	New Delhi, March 29: Foreign telecom operators have lined up around Rs 57,000-crore of investments in India, at a time when the economy is ravaged by a slowdown.        
	UAE-based Etisalat will invest Rs 5,000 crore in its Indian joint venture over the next few years. The Abu Dhabi firm, which owns a 45 per cent stake in Indias Swan Telecom, will launch its mobile services in the April-June quarter of 2009.         
	Indian telecom has emerged as an attractive investment destination for overseas firms. According to Vsevolod Rozanov, CEO of Sistemas operations in India, the country is a role model for efficiency in telecom because of low-cost operations and high-quality network.         
	Russias Sistema holds 74 per cent in Shyam Telelink. It plans to spend Rs 27,500 crore over the next four years to expand its subscriber base and build infrastructure such as towers for transmitting and receiving signals.         
	Limited penetration in rural areas, low charges and cheap handsets make India an attractive investment target. The market size and the scope to get new subscribers remain key factors enticing foreign telecom companies to invest and expand operations in India, Stephen Tan, chief executive officer of Singapore Exhibition Services, told The Telegraph.        
	Malaysias Maxis Communications, which holds a 74 per cent stake in GSM mobile operator Aircel, plans to double its investment to Rs 50,000 crore by 2012. We will complete the investment of Rs 25,000 crore by the year-end for a network rollout. The rest of the amount will be invested in the next two years, said Sandip Das, CEO of Maxis.         
	Aircel, which recently launched its operations in Delhi with competitive segment-wise rate offerings, plans to complete a pan-India rollout in 24 months and increase its subscriber base to 30 million from 17 million.        
	While the company has been selective in its investment approach and will now become even more in these turbulent times, India remains one of the largest telecom markets in the world in terms of growth and scale, said Mohammed Hassan Omran, chairman of Etisalat.        
	India telecom is growing at annual growth rate of 18 per cent and is expected to generate more than $37 billion in revenues by 2012, said analysts.

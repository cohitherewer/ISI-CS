          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Weighing options                                  
	Mumbai, Dec. 16: Godrej Consumer Products Ltd (GCPL) plans to raise Rs 3,000 crore through a variety of instruments.        
	The money will be used to fund acquisitions, including the 51 per cent stake that Sara Lee of the US holds in a joint venture with the Godrej group that was formed in 1987.        
	GCPLs board of directors approved the capital raising plan here today. The company will seek approvals from its shareholders and other statutory clearances before it starts raising the money.        
	H.K. Press, vice-chairman of GCPL, told The Telegraph that the company hadnt decided whether to raise the money through equity, debt or a combination of the two modes. He admitted that the money would be used to fund buyouts.        
	Press added that GCPL was actively looking at some likely targets and had already started negotiations. The group is eyeing both local and overseas entities. The board will place an enabling resolution before the shareholders for approval. It will raise funds if a deal materialises. Press said the acquisition of Sara Lees stake in the joint venture  Godrej Sara Lee Ltd  would depend on the outcome of the negotiations between the two partners.        
	Godrej Sara Lee has been in the news recently after Procter amp; Gamble announced it was buying Sara Lees air-care brand Ambi Pur for 320 million euros. However, in India, Ambi Pur is housed under the Godrej Sara Lee joint venture which has the right to sell this brand along with other products from the Sara Lee stable.        
	There are reports that Sara Lee may be selling its global insecticide business as it wants to concentrate on food and coffee.

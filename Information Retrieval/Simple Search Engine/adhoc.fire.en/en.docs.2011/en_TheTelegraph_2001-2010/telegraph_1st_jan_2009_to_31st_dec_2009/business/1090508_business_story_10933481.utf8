	Calcutta, May 7: JSW Steel Ltd has suffered a consolidated net loss of Rs 39.93 crore during the fourth quarter ended March 31 on the back of an inventory write-down and a demand contraction in the US.        
	The companys plate and pipe mill in the US recorded a loss of $61.1 million, or Rs 305 crore, during January-March as the worlds largest economy slipped into a recession.

	Vice-chairman Sajjan Jindal said he was confident of selling more steel during this fiscal, with the expansion of the Vijaynagar unit to 6.8 million tonnes from 4 million tonnes. The company has projected a 78 per cent growth in saleable steel. JSW said it was on track to expand the Vijaynagar plants capacity to 10 million tonnes by 2011.        
	Bengal plan        
	JSW was silent on the progress of the Bengal plant. It said all new projects would be taken up at an appropriate time after they attained financial closures. Meanwhile, Biswadip Gupta, CEO of JSW Bengal Steel, has stepped down from the JSW Steel board. Seshagiri Rao, director (finance), has been appointed joint managing director and group CFO of JSW Steel.

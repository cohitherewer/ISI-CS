The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Cloud over Dishergarh stake sale

	New Delhi, Dec. 2: State-run insurance companies  the LIC and the GIC  may not sell their stakes in DPSC Ltd, formerly Dishergarh Power Supply Corporation.        
	Top finance ministry sources said the two financial institutions may not sell their shares, but refused to elaborate. This raises doubt over Andrew Yules bid to sell stake in the power utility.         
	Public sector Andrew Yule along with the Life Insurance Corporation (LIC) and the General Insurance Corporation (GIC) had put their 57.17 per cent in DPSC on the block. However, representatives of the LIC and the GIC did not attend the auction held on November 20. While Yule holds little over 15 per cent in DPSC, the LIC and the GIC together hold around 41 per cent.        
	We have not paid for the share sale as yet as we have no word from the government or from the financial institutions as yet, Sreis Hemant Kanoria told The Telegraph. Kanoria led a consortium of Indian Power Corporation and Srei Infrastructure to win the auction, offering Rs 710 a share for the 57.17 per cent stake.         
	According to sources, Srei and Indian Power, which is a 50:50 joint venture between Srei and Bhaskar Silicon, are worried that the financial institutions may vote against the selloff and instead wait for either a higher price or decide to hold on to their stakes.         
	DPSCs managing director S. Radhakrishna, who had bid on behalf of Descon, said, We had objected at the time of the bidding, saying that the two FIs were absent.         
	Descon, a 100 per cent subsidiary of DPSC, has pledged its 32.31 per cent holding in DPSC to Sajjan Jindal-controlled JSW Energy.         
	Andrew Yule managing director Kallol Dutta was in Delhi to inform top government officials about the result of the auction. He is believed to have told them that the auction fetched a price-earnings (PE) ratio of around 36 per cent, which is far higher than the PE of most power sector firms, including blue chips like Tata Power.         
	However, the finance ministry, which controls the two financial institutions, is not in favour of the sale at the moment.        
	The ministry would like the insurance firms to hold on to their stakes for better gains from their shareholding in the future.         
	If the insurance duo hold on to their stakes, Srei will have to either agree to buy the shares at a higher rate or pull out of the deal. The bidding could then either be scrapped or the second highest bidder  Descon  would acquire Yules shares in DPSC.         
	Analysts say JSW Energy, to which Descons shares are pledged, will thus have control over DPSC.

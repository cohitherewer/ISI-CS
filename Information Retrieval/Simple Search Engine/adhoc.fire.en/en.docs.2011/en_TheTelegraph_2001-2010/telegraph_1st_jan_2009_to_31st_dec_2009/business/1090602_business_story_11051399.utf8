	Hyderabad, June 1: The US-based Sikorsky will shift its helicopter-making facility in Japan to Andhra Pradesh, through a tie-up with Tata Advanced Systems Ltd, which plans to invest Rs 1,000 crore in the proposed Aerospace Special Economic Zone at Adibhatla village on the outskirts of the city.        
	The facility will provide direct employment to 1,000 people, according to B.P. Acharya, managing director of the Andhra Pradesh Industrial Infrastructure Corporation.        
	He said the government was providing huge subsidies and tax holiday to the project.        
	The state government today handed over 50 acres of land to the Tatas. The land is priced at Rs 30 per lakh acre.        
	Besides, the Tata plant will also provide indirect employment to another 4,000 people once it is commissioned by June 2010, sources said.        
	They said the Tatas had plans to establish aerospace and defence products manufacturing facility, as well, at the SEZ.        
	The helicopter plan comes close on the heels of a Rs 6,000-crore project in the states Chittoor district to make heavy equipment for power firms. Over 2,000 will get jobs at Chittoor within three years of the project, which is being jointly set up by NTPC and Bhel.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Pension scheme gets delayed
                                                                                                               Pension scheme gets delayed
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, March 19: The government today deferred the rollout of a new pension scheme for employees in the private sector.        
	The scheme, which would have allowed limited investment in stock markets, was scheduled to be launched on April 1.        
	Keeping in view the model code of conduct for elections, it has not been possible for the Pension Funds Regulatory Development Authority (PFRDA) to continue its information campaign and undertake other preparatory activities as originally scheduled, the government said today.        
	It has been decided to defer the new pension system, it said.        
	Sources said the pension regulator had sought the Election Commissions approval to market the new scheme.        
	Pending a reply from the election watchdog, the regulator has been unable to launch a full-fledged campaign.        
	In 2004, the government had introduced a new pension scheme for its staff to reduce liabilities and offer workers better returns on their savings.         
	In August last year, the government had advised the pension regulator to extend the scheme to all citizens.        
	In February this year, the regulator shortlisted six fund managers  subsidiaries of Reliance Capital, UTI, the SBI, IDFC, ICICI Prudential Life Insurance and Kotak Mahindra Bank  for the new scheme.        
	An expert panel headed by HDFC chairman Deepak Parekh had recommended that the scheme should give investors the option to put their money entirely into equity funds.        
	The panel, constituted by the regulator, also recommended that other options could include a combination of investments in government bonds, bank deposits, liquid mutual funds, corporate bonds and index funds.

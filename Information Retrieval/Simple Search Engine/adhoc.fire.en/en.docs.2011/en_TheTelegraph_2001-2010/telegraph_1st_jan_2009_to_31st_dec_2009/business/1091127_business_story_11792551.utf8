          SOUNAK MITRA                                            
	Calcutta, Nov. 26: Buoyed by soaring prices in the domestic market and rising export demand, tea plantation scrips are stirring a heady brew on the Bombay Stock Exchange .        
	An analysis of last one years data shows that while sensex, the benchmark BSE index, has fetched a return of around 87 per cent, these tea plantations scrips have all posted triple-digit gains.        
	For example, the McLeod Russel stock, which closed at Rs 37.75 on November 26, 2008, has jumped 584.5 per cent to close at Rs 258.40 today.         
	Other tea plantation companies such as Jayshree Tea, Harrisons Malayalam, Goodricke Group and many other smaller firms have seen their earnings swell during the past one year, sending their stock prices soaring.         
	However, tea marketing companies such as Tata Tea  the stock registered an 84.01 per cent rise on the BSE in the last one year  did not perform so well during the period.        
	During the last one year, robust internal demand has pushed up tea prices in the domestic market by over 30 per cent. During the January-September period, tea witnessed a better price realisation in the export market at Rs 135.42 per kg against Rs 111.93 per kg in the same period last year.        
	Last month, Aditya Khaitan, chairman of the Indian Tea Association (ITA) and managing director of McLeod Russel, had said tea prices in India were at least 15 per cent, or Rs 20 a kg, lower compared with that of the international markets.        
	Global tea prices are trading at $3.25 or Rs 160 a kg but in India the average tea price is seen at Rs 135-140 for 2009-10, Khaitan had said. During the July-September period, the average price was Rs 141.51, which is more than Rs 30 a kg over last years price.         
	During April-June and July-September quarters, most tea plantations companies have reported robust growth in revenues and earnings. Traditionally, these two quarters capture the business during the main season, which is from April to October.         
	McLeod Russel, the countrys largest tea plantation company, has reported a 23 per cent growth in net sales and a 340 per cent rise in net profit at Rs 31.18 crore in the April-June quarter.         
	During the July-September quarter, the company reported a 58 per cent rise in net profit at Rs 192.19 crore against Rs 121.73 crore during the same period last fiscal.         
	The companys net sales rose 23 per cent to Rs 343.77 crore.        
	According to analysts, tea prices fall by close to 10 per cent in the off-season in the plantation business between October-end and December. However, this year, the prices have remained strong despite the off-season.

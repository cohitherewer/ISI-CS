The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | IT stocks get Nortel flu
                                                                                                               IT stocks get Nortel flu
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Mumbai, Jan. 15: The move by Nortel Networks Corp to file for bankruptcy today impacted stock prices of leading IT service majors such as Wipro and Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) on fears that the development could hurt their revenues.        
	Nortel is a major customer of these companies. Analysts said Bangalore-based Sasken Communication Technologies could be the worst hit because of the development as around 10 per cent of its revenues come from Nortel. The North American telephone equipment manufacturer also holds a 9.5 per cent stake in Sasken.        
	We feel Wipro could have a material impact on its revenues, said a note put out by Anagram Securities. The brokerage said that telecom vertical contributed 10 per cent to Wipros revenue in the July-September quarter of 2008. Wipro had also acquired 3D Networks in 2006 which got a majority of its revenues from Nortel.        
	In a communication to the stock exchanges, Wipro said Nortel accounted for less than 1.5 per cent of its IT business revenue.        
	Wipro said that the outstanding amount from Nortel subject to arbitration was around $15 million. Wipro is also a partner to Nortel for system integration work in Asia and India and we expect no impact to our clients, the company said. Shares of the company dipped 2.4 per cent to close at Rs 235.30 on the BSE.        
	Infosys Technologies and TCS indicated that Nortel contributed to less than 0.5 per cent of their revenues. Indications from Infosys are that outstanding receivables from Nortel is around $4 million. Although the Infosys stock ended in the green, the TCS scrip lost 2.5 per cent to end at Rs 510 on the BSE.        
	Within the IT pack, Sasken suffered the most with its share getting pounded 15.5 per cent to finish at Rs 43.75.

	Mumbai, Aug. 24: Fortis Healthcare Ltd  the healthcare chain run by brothers Malvinder and Shivinder Singh, former owners of drug maker Ranbaxy  will buy 10 hospitals from Wockhardt Hospitals Ltd for Rs 909 crore.        
	The transaction, which is touted as the biggest deal in the healthcare industry, is expected to close by December. It will increase Fortis existing capacity to 5,180 beds from 3,278 across the country.         
	The deal, which has been under negotiation for some time, includes two greenfield hospitals, one of which is located in Calcutta.        
	Fortis will use a part of the proceeds from a Rs 1,000-crore rights issue in September and draw the rest from internal accruals to finance the deal.        
	In Calcutta, Fortis will acquire the 67-bed Wockhardt Kidney Institute on Rashbehari Avenue, the Wockhardt Medical Centre on Sarat Bose Road and a 414-bed greenfield project at Anandapur, near the Eastern Metropolitan Bypass.        
	It will also acquire five hospitals in Bangalore and two in Mumbai as part of the deal.        
	Fortis expects to contribute Rs 190 crore out of its purchase price for the two projects that are under construction.        
	At present, Fortis has 28 hospitals across the country. It also owns the Escorts brand of hospitals that it bought in 2005 for Rs 585 crore.        
	This landmark deal is an important milestone in the history of Indian healthcare as it brings together two leading brands to create a national healthcare delivery network, said Fortis group chairman Malvinder Singh.        
	Once the deal is completed, Fortis will emerge as the leading private healthcare operator in several states, including Delhi, Maharashtra, Karnataka, Punjab, Haryana, Rajasthan and Uttar Pradesh.        
	The healthcare chain will have a talent pool of 9,250 personnel, including over 1,575 doctors and 5,000 nurses and paramedics.         
	The coming together of three leading brands  Fortis, Escorts and Wockhardt  will provide the needed impetus to take heathcare delivery in our country to the next level, Fortis managing director Shivinder Singh said.        
	The Habil Khorakiwala-promoted Workhardt is in the midst of a debt restructuring programme and is looking at selling some of its non-core assets to raise funds.

	New Delhi, Jan. 22: Inflation rose marginally to 5.60 per cent for the week ended January 10, reversing an 11-week trend, as oil and transport strikes impacted the prices of vegetables.         
	Analysts said the Reserve Bank of India could cut interest rates in its monetary policy review later this month to reduce the borrowing cost.        
	Inflation was 5.24 per cent in the previous week and 4.36 per cent during the corresponding period last year.        
	The increase in the inflation rate has temporarily reversed the 11-week declining trend which had set in since the last week of October. It is largely attributable to the impact of oil and transport sector strikes, the finance ministry said.        
	Vegetables turned expensive by 18.4 per cent and processed fish by 42.8 per cent. However, sea fish, paper items, rubber products and chemicals became cheaper.

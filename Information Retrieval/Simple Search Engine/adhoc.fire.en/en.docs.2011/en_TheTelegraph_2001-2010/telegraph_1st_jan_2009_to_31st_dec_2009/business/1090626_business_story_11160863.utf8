                                                                                                               Tata firm inks voice service pact with BT 
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                            
	Mumbai, June 25: Tata Communications Ltd has signed a five-year outsourcing deal with UKs BT Group for voice services. The deal can fetch $1 billion in revenues for Tata Communications over a five-year period.        
	Under the deal, Tata Communications will supply the UK firms international direct dial (IDD) and other voice termination services in places outside BTs own footprint countries. BT, in turn, will be the distribution channel for Tata Communications IDD services in the UK and later in other markets of Europe.        
	Tata Communications declined to comment on the deal value. However, a company official said, We are clocking 24 billion minutes of traffic. After this pact, we expect an additional 6 billion minutes of traffic a year, or 25 per cent of what we are doing now.         
	Analysts said the 24 billion minutes of traffic brought in revenues worth $1.2 billion and the Tatas could get similar numbers from the deal over five years.        
	Michel Guyot, president of global voice solutions at Tata Communications, said, The agreement will increase both the partners competitiveness and will enhance our respective service offerings.

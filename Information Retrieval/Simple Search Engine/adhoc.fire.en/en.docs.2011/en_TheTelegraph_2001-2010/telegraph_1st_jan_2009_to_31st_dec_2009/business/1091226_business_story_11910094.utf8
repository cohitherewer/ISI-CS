	New Delhi, Dec. 25: The telecom regulator is likely to propose the separation of the process of 2G spectrum allocation from the grant of a licence. Operators may also have the freedom to use spectrum for any type of service.        
	Trai is likely to submit its recommendations to the government by January.         
	It will also give its views on the sharing and trading of spectrum, limiting the number of operators in a circle, the auction of 2G spectrum and mergers and acquisitions.        
	Spectrum should not only be auctioned, but allocation should also not be linked to a service. The choice of its use should be left to the operator, said officials.        
	At present, spectrum allocation is linked to a particular service. Spectrum in the 900 MHz and 1800 MHz bands are for 2G; in 2.1 GHz band for 3G; and 2.5 GHz for broadband.        
	Sources said Trai wanted to remove the restriction. Spectrum in the 900 MHz band could then be used not only for 2G but also for broadband or even 3G, though the band was not suited for the efficient provision of 3G services.        
	The regulator is planning to propose the auction of spectrum against the current practice of bundling them with a licence.        
	Licences come bundled with 4.4 MHz of spectrum, the minimum amount required for mobile services. Subsequently, the operators are awarded the scarce resource in slabs of 1.8 units on meeting subscriber targets.        
	Spectrum allocation based on subscribers hit a hurdle in 2007 as the government decided to increase the number of users required for additional airwaves.        
	A recent department of telecom (DoT) committee on 2G spectrum, chaired by DoT additional secretary Subodh Kumar, had recommended that spectrum should be auctioned, as was done in most countries.         
	It also recommended that operators should be allowed to trade in spectrum for a fee.        
	The committee which included representatives from the government and Trai besides technology experts and industry executives was formed in June 2008 to resolve the problems over spectrum allocation.        
	DoT had sent the report to the telecom regulator in July asking for its recommendations. Trais recommendations are crucial as operators want clarity on 2G spectrum allocation before they plan to invest in 3G.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                           Tata Steel managing director B. Muthuraman (left) with Corus CEO Philippe Varin in Mumbai on Friday. (Fotocorp)                                   
	Mumbai, Feb. 27: Tata Steel today beat market expectations when it posted a consolidated net profit of Rs 813.89 crore for the third quarter ended December 31, 2008.         
	In the corresponding period last year, profit was much higher at Rs 1,415.54 crore. Analysts, however, were fearing losses because of the impact of the global recession on European subsidiary Corus.         
	Net sales for the quarter rose to Rs 33,191.01 crore from Rs 31,898.54 crore in the same period last year.         
	B. Muthuraman, managing director of Tata Steel, said the company was planning to sell 1.6 million tonnes in the January-March quarter, which is 45 per cent more than the sales of 1.1mt during October-December 2008. Sales in January were over 500,000 million tonnes, while they stood at 600,000 tonnes this month.         
	According to Muthuraman, Tata Steel is renegotiating contracts with raw material suppliers to keep costs under check.         
	There is also a plan to bring down overheads and other operating costs, while some capex proposals are being postponed. However, the expansion of the Jamshedpur unit is on track.         
	The measures come at a time when the Corus order book has fallen 40 per cent. Corus is also making prudent cuts wherever possible, Philippe Varin, the present CEO of Corus, said.        
	Varin will step down from his post on April 6. He will be replaced by Kirby Adams.        
	Adams is the former chief executive of BlueScope Steel, Australia. The appointments will be effective from April 9.         
	He will look after the operations of Tata Steel in Europe and will be in charge of the initiatives to acquire raw materials globally.        
	Meanwhile, Tata Steel chief operating officer H. M. Nerurkar has joined the board of directors of the company. He will be responsible for the companys Indian and South Asian operations.

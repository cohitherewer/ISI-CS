        Mutual funds are wooing customers with asset allocation plans that allow investors to switch between equities and debt schemes and reap gains, says Srikumar Bondyopadhyay                                            
	Investors can take a lesson or two from the developments in the global financial markets over the last one year. In a fluctuating equity market, prices of assets move up and down. Moreover, prices of different asset classes move in different directions.        
	This emphasises the importance of diversifying ones investment among different asset classes. This is called asset allocation in financial jargon.         
	Asset allocation, however, is not a static concept where you plan it once and then forget it. It is a dynamic wealth management strategy where you have to keep on shuffling funds among different assets depending on the market condition.         
	In this way, you can reduce your risk and enhance return on the overall investment portfolio.         
	Mutuals in action        
	Mutual funds these days offer a wide array of schemes, including asset allocation funds.         
	As an investor, you can try your hand at asset allocation yourself by investing in equity mutual funds and fixed- income instruments or income funds.         
	However, if you re-shuffle your portfolio, capital gains arising out of sales of some assets will be subject to tax. The tax burden may lower your return on investments.         
	A mutual fund, on the other hand, acts as a pass-through certificate and is not subject to any tax. Thus, an asset allocation fund can serve your purpose in a more tax-friendly manner.         
	However, asset allocation funds are different from hybrid or balanced funds though they both invest in stocks and bonds.         
	A hybrid or a balanced fund usually maintains a fixed allocation ratio between stocks and bonds and doesnt change it very frequently.         
	An asset allocation fund, on the other hand, has the flexibility to move in and out of stocks and bonds. It also has the freedom to invest 100 per cent either in stocks or bonds.        
	Moreover, the allocation of money depends to a large extent on the fund managers perception of which asset class is expected to perform better.         
	For instance, if stock markets are doing well, the fund may invest its entire corpus in stocks. If the bond markets are bullish, the fund may choose to sell the stocks it owns and invest in bonds.         
	At present, there are a few asset allocation funds in the market. The allocation strategy is different for different funds. Mutual funds started offering asset allocation funds in 2002 after the depression following the dotcom bubble burst.        
	Top scorers        
	ICICI Prudential Dynamic fund was the first such scheme launched in October 2002. The funds mandate allowed it to invest either 100 per cent in equities or 100 per cent in debt instruments, depending on the market condition.         
	Since its launch, the fund has given an annual return of 27.24 per cent. In fact, the fund has yielded a better return than diversified equity funds.         
	HSBC Mutual Fund, which launched its dynamic asset allocation fund in August 2007, also gave a better return than the category average in the last three years.         
	Birla Sun Life Asset Allocation Aggressive has been the best performer among all diversified equity schemes in terms of returns in the past 12 months.         
	Usually, an investor himself takes care of his assets and invests in equities, equity mutual funds and income funds or fixed income instruments.         
	When the debt-equity balance gets distorted because of market conditions, the investor needs to sell one asset class and buy more of the other to restore the parity.         
	For example, if your initial exposure to equity was 60 per cent of your total investments and it increases to 80 per cent following a run-up in stock prices, you will have to sell this excess 20 per cent in equities and move the cash to debt instruments, if the markets fall.         
	Time management        
	The principle may sound simple. But it requires a good judgement of time on part of the investor. Though there are indicators, such as price-earning (PE) or price-book value (PB) ratios of the sensex or the Nifty, it is not easy to determine the right time to sell or buy equities.        
	Asset allocation funds take care of these issues by automatically reallocating between equity and debt.         
	While some funds follow a highly sophisticated mathematical model for this dynamic asset allocation process, professional fund managers do this exercise for others.         
	Include all        
	However, the problem with most asset allocation funds available in the market is that they invest in two asset classes only  equity and debt.         
	Given the recent experience in the financial markets, one should also include precious metals in ones investment portfolio to increase returns as well as reduce risk.         
	One can now invest in gold in paper form through gold exchange-traded funds. Besides, there are fixed-income instruments such as the National Savings Certificate, Public Provident Fund and bank fixed deposits, which have a different risk-return profile.         
	An asset allocation fund may help you strike a balance between your investments in equity and debt securities. But your investment portfolio also needs to include precious metals, real estate and fixed income instruments. For allocation of funds in these assets, youll have to depend on your own discretion.

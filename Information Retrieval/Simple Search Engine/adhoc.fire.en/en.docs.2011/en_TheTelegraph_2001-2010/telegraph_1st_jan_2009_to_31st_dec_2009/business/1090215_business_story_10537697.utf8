          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Mumbai, Feb. 14: Two public sector entities  Nuclear Power Corporation of India (NPCIL) and National Thermal Power Corporation (NTPC)  today entered into a joint venture pact to set up nuclear power plants.        
	According to the memorandum of understanding (MoU) signed today, the joint venture will have a 51:49 shareholding between NPCIL and NTPC.         
	NTPC will invest around Rs 1,000 crore to set up nuclear power plants of around 2,000MW capacity over the next few years.        
	The joint venture will initially build two nuclear power plants of 700MW each, Jairam Ramesh, Union minister of state for commerce and power, said today.         
	The MoU was signed here today by S. K. Jain, NPCIL chairman and managing director, and NTPC chairman R. S. Sharma in the presence of Jairam Ramesh and Atomic Energy Commission chairman Anil Kakodkar.         
	The new entity will employ the indigenous technology of NPCIL which uses natural uranium and heavy water.        
	According to Ramesh, the company will be formed in the next three months and the site and the projects will be identified under the leadership of Anil Kakodkar.        
	NPCIL has plans to set up eight units of 700MW of pressurised heavy water reactors.        
	Ramesh said around 6,000MW of atomic power can be generated by the end of this year from domestic plants. There are around 17 such units in the country and they operate below 40 per cent of their capacity. The plant load factor is expected to increase to over 90 per cent because of the availability of uranium from France and Russia.        
	Among private sector players, Larsen amp; Toubro is keen to tap opportunities in nuclear power. Last month, it entered into an agreement with Toshibas Westinghouse Electric Company to pursue nuclear power plant business in India.

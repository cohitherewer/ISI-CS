The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Feel at home with this fund
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Feel at home with this fund
                            
	IDFC Mutual Fund is planning to come out with a real estate fund, the first in the mutual fund industry. The market regulator has allowed mutual funds to launch real estate funds, but none took the plunge.        
	In the absence of real estate investment trusts (REITS)  a popular instrument in developed markets for low-risk investors  real estate mutual funds were felt to be the only way out for small investors to include this asset class in his/her investment portfolio at a lower cost.        
	The IDFC Real Estate Equity Fund is yet to get an approval from the regulator. It proposes to invest in equity and equity related instruments of companies engaged in real estate and related activities.        
	The fund will invest not only in securities of property developers, but also in securities of banks and housing finance companies.         
	This will be an interesting fund, given the prospects of real estate. The number of housing loan accounts was a little over 30.35 lakh in 2004. The number soared to 52.14 lakh in the following four years, a growth of nearly 72 per cent.         
	In value terms, the amount of housing loan sanctioned during the same period increased to Rs 2,48,435 crore from Rs 85,346 crore during the same period, a growth of 191 per cent! In fact, housing loan as a percentage of the countrys GDP rose from 3.36 per cent to 5.75 per cent between 2004 and 2008. This percentage, however, is still very low compared to other emerging markets.         
	At a seminar in Mumbai, RBI deputy governor K.C. Chakrabarty highlighted the vast business potential for banking from housing loan. At the end of financial year 2008-09, about 44 per cent of banks retail loan portfolio comprised housing loan. This was, however, only 9 per cent of the banks total loan and advances.         
	According to Chakrabarty, a one per cent growth in GDP translates into a 3 per cent growth in housing loan.         
	Assuming a real GDP growth of 6.5 per cent in 2009-10, the housing loan is expected to grow at 20.3 per cent in the current financial year.

                                                                                                               Stake sale fetches DLF Rs 3,800cr
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                                            
	New Delhi, May 13: The promoters of DLF  the countrys No. 1 realty firm today sold 9.9 per cent, or 16.8 crore shares, of the company to raise around Rs 3,800 crore from institutions.        
	Deutsche Securities Mauritius, Euro Pacific Growth Fund, Copthall Mauritius Investment and Capital Research Mgmt. Co picked up 9.1 crore shares.         
	HSBC, Halbis and Fidelity bought a chunk of the remaining 7 crore shares of the K.P. Singh-promoted company.        
	The shares were sold for Rs 230 apiece, a 1.1 per cent discount over todays closing price of Rs 232.50 and much lower than DLFs IPO price of Rs 525. This leaves the promoters with a 78.6 per cent stake in the company.        
	The proceeds from the issue will be pumped into group company DLF Assets, which buys commercial properties from the parent for lease.        
	DLF Assets will use Rs 2,100 crore of the money raised to redeem the compulsory convertible preference shares issued to DE Shaw.        
	The US hedge fund had invested over $400 million in DLF Assets back in 2007 when the market was still booming.         
	DLF Assets also owes Rs 4,900 crore to the parent firm and the stake sale proceeds will be used to reduce this liability.        
	DLF Assets was planning special economic zones in Gurgaon, Chennai and Hyderabad but couldnt make much progress because of the downturn.         
	At one point, DLF had even considered an equity flotation to redeem the bonds from DE Shaw. But this idea was abandoned as the market went through a roller coaster.        
	Another $200 million was raised from a fund sponsored by investment banking firm Lehman Brothers, which later sold the stake to SC Asia. Last year, it raised $450 million from Symphony Capital.        
	DLF promoters said the latest deal was one of the tightest achieved in recent times globally for transactions of this size.        
	The deal raises the companys float in the market and will attract foreign institutional investment, said Rajiv Singh, vice-chairman of DLF.        
	The transaction has increased the free float to 21.3 per cent from 11.4 per cent earlier.JP Morgan and Deutsche Bank executed the transaction for the promoter group.         
	DLF expects to be a debt free company in the next few months, Singh said.

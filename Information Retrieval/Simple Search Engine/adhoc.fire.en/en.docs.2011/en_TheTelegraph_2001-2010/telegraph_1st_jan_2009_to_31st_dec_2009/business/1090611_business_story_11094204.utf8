The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Rising crude casts shadow on fuel talks
                                                                                                               Rising crude casts shadow on fuel talks
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Deora: Setting priorities                                  
	New Delhi, June 10: Fuel pricing and subsidies to state-run oil marketers will figure in the pre-budget discussions of petroleum minister Murli Deora and finance minister Pranab Mukherjee on June 15.         
	A plea to restore tax breaks on natural gas production is also likely to be on the agenda.        
	Sources said Deora would take up issues relating to the deregulation of fuel prices but would advise caution against it as global crude oil prices are rising again, breaching $71 a barrel today.         
	Petroleum secretary R. S. Pandey told reporters that deregulation is an inter-ministerial issue. The government is committed to reforms but we have to make sure that people get fuel at affordable rates.        
	In the absence of a deregulation, the petroleum and finance ministries will have to take a call on giving higher subsidies to the oil marketers through the issue of fresh oil bonds as well as direct subsidies on the sale of kerosene.        
	Indias fiscal deficit is at 6.1 per cent of the countrys GDP for 2008-09. The figure does not include off-budget liabilities such as fertiliser subsidies and compensation to state-run oil companies that could be another 4 per cent of GDP.         
	Deora would also emphasise on restoring the tax break on natural gas production.         
	The latest round of oil block auction under the New Exploration and Licensing Policy (Nelp) has been delayed because of a lack of clarity on gas relief.        
	Deora may also press for infrastructure status for natural gas.        
	According to income tax rules, companies commercially producing mineral oil are eligible to a 100 per cent tax break for seven consecutive assessment years, including the initial year.         
	In the budget for the fiscal year 2008-09, the finance ministry had limited the definition of mineral oil to only crude oil and had excluded natural gas.        
	India is offering 24 deep-sea blocks, 28 shallow water blocks and 18 onland blocks for bidding in the eighth round of Nelp, eyeing $3 billion foreign investment.

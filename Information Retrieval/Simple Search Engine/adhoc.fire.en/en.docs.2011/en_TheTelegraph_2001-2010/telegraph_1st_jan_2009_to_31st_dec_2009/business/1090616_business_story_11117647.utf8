The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Deora bid to battle crude curse
                                                                                                               Deora bid to battle crude curse
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Deora: Weighing options                                  
	New Delhi, June 15: A fuel price hike is one of the options before the government to protect state-owned oil marketing companies from the rising global price of crude, now trading at $71 a barrel.        
	We are seriously concerned about the rise in crude oil prices. We have to look for solutions, petroleum minister Murli Deora told reporters after meeting finance minister Pranab Mukherjee with his budget wish list.        
	We have to seriously look at solutions. The alternatives before us are raising petrol and diesel prices, asking the government to make up for the revenue loss (of fuel retailers) through issuing oil bonds and upstream firms (such as ONGC) chipping in. It could be all of the three as had been the practice till now, he said.        
	The petroleum minister also sought from Mukherjee a seven-year tax holiday in natural gas production. He also pressed for declared goods status for gas.        
	Oil firms are losing Rs 3.10 per litre of petrol, Rs 12 per litre of kerosene and Rs 60 per domestic LPG cylinder.         
	The profit on diesel has come down from Rs 0.32 a litre in the second fortnight of May to Rs 0.05 a litre.         
	The losses will rise as the average crude price in June has increased to $68.63 per barrel from $58 a barrel in May.        
	State-owned Indian Oil, Bharat Petroleum and Hindustan Petroleum have urged the government to hike fuel prices as they are suffering losses of around Rs 120 crore a day.         
	In the last fiscal, the trio had to cope with under-recoveries of Rs 1,03,908 crore.        
	We must urgently find solutions. This is an issue he (finance minister) may decide at the time of the budget. We have to find avenues, the minister said. Pranab Mukherjee will present the budget in Parliament on July 6.        
	Analysts said the government could increase fuel prices to contain the mounting fiscal deficit and subsidy bill.         
	However, politically the decision could prove disastrous as the government is in the honeymoon period of 100 days.        
	From its peak of $142 a barrel in July last year, crude prices touched a low of $32.40 in December.         
	During the last price cut in petrol, diesel and LPG in January, crude averaged $42.12 a barrel.        
	Crude oil prices have started firming up with a revival in demand in major consuming economies such as China and India.

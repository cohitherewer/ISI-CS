                                                                                                               PM rules out CEO salary cap
                            
	Mumbai, Oct. 11 (PTI): Prime Minister Manmohan Singh today ruled out any move to impose restrictions on the remuneration of CEOs, saying it is best left to the boards of various companies.        
	We still believe that salaries are best determined by the boards of various companies and the government as such has no intention of imposing restrictions on CEOs salaries, he said.        
	Corporate affairs minister Salman Khursheed last week asked companies to stop paying vulgar salaries to their top managers keeping in mind the austerity drive by the government.         
	Days later, he, however, clarified that the Centre had no intention to control remuneration in India Inc.        
	Singh today said, In my address to one of the meetings of the CII, I had raised the issue in a general way, adding that the government had not taken any view on the matter.

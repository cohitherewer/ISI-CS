        Health insurance is the magic pill for a secure future. Srikumar Bondyopadhyay lists the pros and cons                                           
	Shantanu Mitra, who worked in a private firm, had meticulously planned his savings for the future. A proper financial planning ensured that he led a comfortable life after retirement. However, within two years of his retirement, his wife was detected with cancer. Gradually, Shantanu saw his savings get depleted to pay for the huge medical bills. Shantanu had no health insurance as he thought his savings would be enough to survive any medical emergency.         
	The rising costs of medicine and treatment make it difficult to anticipate medical expenses in advance. Such emergencies can play havoc with ones personal finances. Thus, like life insurance, health insurance should be an integral part of ones financial planning.        
	Points to ponder         
	Buying the right health insurance, however, is not an easy task unless you have a clear understanding of your requirements and the products on offer. There are a few things to consider before you opt for a health cover.        
	With healthcare expenses rising at an annual rate of 15 per cent, a medical treatment that costs Rs 1 lakh now will cost Rs 2,01,136 after five years, Rs 4,04,556 after 10 years and Rs 16,36,654 after 20 years.         
	The average life expectancy in India has gone up to 69.25 year, according to a 2008 estimate, from 58 years in 1996.         
	Compared to this, the morbidity rate  the number of people (per thousand) living with disability due to accident or illness  was nearly 100, according to the National Sample Survey 2004-05. The data also indicate that the incidence is higher for rich people (106 per 1000 people) than the poor (82 per 1000 people) because of lifestyle-related diseases.         
	While we are living longer, were living with more disabilities due to diseases or accidents.        
	Moreover, the older you are, the higher will be the insurance premium rate. For example, a 25-year-old buying a health insurance having a sum assured of Rs 1 lakh will have to pay an annual premium of Rs 1,095, or just Rs 3 a day. But a 60-year-old will have to pay Rs 3,628 per annum for the same sum assured.        
	Age factor        
	There is another advantage of buying a health insurance at a younger age. There are hardly any health insurance plans that cover pre-existing diseases in the first three-four years.         
	So, it is better to buy health insurance at a younger age when you are in good health and dont need to make a claim in the initial years.         
	The no-claim years will fetch you the cumulative bonus given by the insurer on the sum assured of the policy. Insurers generally increase the sum assured at the rate of 10 per cent per annum on a cumulative basis for every claim-free year. However, the bonus is capped at 50 per cent of the original sum assured.        
	So, if you buy a health insurance of Rs 1 lakh at the age of 25 years, your sum assured will increase to Rs 1.5 lakh when you reach 29 years 6 months without any rise in the premium rate.        
	Market watch        
	Let us now examine the health insurance products available in the market.         
	At present, both non-life and life insurance companies offer health insurance plans. But there are major differences in the nature of these products and the benefits they offer.         
	Health insurance schemes of non-life insurance companies are indemnity plans wherein the insurer pays the stipulated cover to the policyholder when a claim arises.         
	In standalone plans of life insurance companies, the insurer pays a pre-defined amount to the policyholder when a claim arises, irrespective of whether the expenses incurred by the policyholder is less or more than the defined benefit.         
	Also, the premium rate is much less in the case of policies sold by non-life insurers than their life insurance counterparts.         
	Health insurance policies are available for individual members as well as for the whole family. Family floater plans, however, cover only spouses and two children. Compared with individual plans, family floaters are cheaper and at a given time, one can claim for any one of the insured members.         
	There are some more points that one should look into before buying a health insurance plan.         
	Co-payment clause : Under this, the policyholder will have to foot a certain portion of the medical bill from his/her own pocket. This co-payment percentage varies from one insurer to other. The less is the co-payment percentage, the more beneficial it is for the policyholder.        
	 Exclusions: While almost all plans do not give any benefit in the initial three to five years for any claim arising out of a pre-existing illness, payments are not made for any medical care within the first 30 to 180 days of the commencement of the policy. However, some insurers, such as the National Insurance Company, have health plans that cover pre-existing hypertension and diabetes, but at a higher premium.         
	Pregnancy-related claims: Excluded in health insurance plans for individuals, while available in group insurance plans. However, Apollo DKV General Insurance is the only company that offers pregnancy benefits under the executive option. Apollo DKVs health plan also covers dental and eyecare treatments that no other insurer does.         
	Surgery benefits: Life insurance companies provide lump sum benefits for surgery. But the benefits are divided into different grades of surgeries and the benefits are payable only for the surgeries listed in the policy document.         
	Health, these days, comes at a cost. So, dont delay in getting yourself a proper health cover.

	New Delhi, Sept. 4: Trade ministers of 35 countries today agreed to resume negotiations in 10 days to conclude the Doha round of talks on the opening up of the global economy under the aegis of the World Trade Organisation. The talks will be held in Geneva.        
	The WTO talks, which had broken down last year, will try to secure a deal by 2010. WTO members are keen on a deal at a time when the US has renewed its demand to link import safeguards for developing countries with greater market access for its manufactures.         
	US trade representative Ron Kirk today dismissed fears voiced by emerging economies that his country was undoing years of painstaking negotiations, while seeking changes and bilateral negotiations.         
	Differences over the mode of the future negotiations  such as the framework of the talks and the date and venue of the meetings beyond Geneva remained; but ministers agreed that trade talks were needed to get the world economy out of recession.         
	Indias commerce minister Anand Sharma said, There has been a breakthrough in negotiations. The impasse in resuming talks has been broken. The two-day meeting was attended by trade ministers from 35 countries.        
	The chief negotiators and senior officials will meet on September 14 in Geneva to restart the entire process. There was a unanimous affirmation of the need to clinch a deal after years of delay, he said. This Geneva deliberations are before the meeting of G-20 leaders in Pittsburgh on September 24-25.        
	The G20 leaders are expected to review the progress of the Doha talks and can probably push a trade accord. Talks had collapsed in Geneva in July 2008 after India, among others, sought deeper cuts in agriculture subsidies than those offered by the rich nations.        
	The tenor and substance of the statements by trade ministers from different countries suggested that few were willing to soften their stands made a year ago in Geneva. However, they agreed that there was need to compromise and strike a deal. If we all maintain the current posture, nothing will move, admitted Kirk.         
	However, Celso Amorim, external relations minister of Brazil, said, Developing countries have no more room for further concessions to rich nations. That seems to have become the crux of the problem The rich want more markets to open up to them so that jobs can be created back home and their firms can profit.

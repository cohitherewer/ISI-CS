The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Easier entry into Bengal farm retail
                                                                                                               Easier entry into Bengal farm retail
          SAMBIT SAHA                          Doors open                                  
	Calcutta, May 24: An order of Calcutta High Court may boost private investment in Bengals farm product marketing sector, overturning years of stiff resistance by the Forward Bloc-led state agricultural marketing board.        
	The court on Thursday directed seven regulated market committees, controlled by the board, to issue licences to private enterprise Keventer Fresh within four weeks to carry out business in agricultural products in their respective areas.        
	Keventer, which supplies fruits and vegetables to German wholesaler Metro Cash amp; Carry and domestic retail giant Reliance Fresh, was denied licences by the committees, set up under the Agriculture Produce Marketing (Regulation) Act.         
	Justice Sanjib Banerjee allowed a batch of seven writ petitions of the company, owned by city-based industrialist Mahendra K. Jalan, challenging the rejection of the applications to grant agri-product marketing licences. Legal experts said the order could encourage many other private enterprises to seek licences.         
	Reliance has so far been denied a licence, while Metro Cash had to wait for an unprecedented intervention by chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee to start operations at its wholesale store on the EM Bypass.        
	Naren Chatterjee, the chairman of the state agri-marketing board and Forward Bloc leader in the forefront of the fight against private investment in the farm business, said the court verdict would be challenged. We will appeal against the order when the high court reopens after the summer recess, he said.         
	Jalan has expressed satisfaction at the court order. We have invested Rs 70 crore in a processing facility in Barasat to supply to various retailers and wholesalers. But we could not utilise it because the board denied us a licence to buy fruits and vegetables from the markets, he said. The licence will allow Keventer to buy fruits and vegetables from the farmers through the seven market committees.

	Calcutta, Sept. 23: The government is against a tight monetary policy, which leads to rising interest rates, at least till the end of this fiscal because it will spoil the growth momentum of the economy.        
	Monetary tightening will not happen before the end of the financial year, finance minister Pranab Mukherjee said here today.        
	GDP growth in the second quarter of the current calendar year is better than the first quarter, and the third and fourth quarters are expected to do even better, he said.         
	Mukherjee was addressing the 155th annual general meeting of the Bengal Chamber of Commerce and Industry.        
	Unless some level of economic recovery is established, no tight monetary policy will be acceptable.        
	Mukherjee said Prime Minister Manmohan Singh would convey this to the members of the G20 at a meet scheduled for September 24 and 25 in Pittsburgh, US, and advise them to follow the same strategy.         
	The G20 will deliberate on the future course of action for a sound and sustainable recovery from the global financial and economic crisis.        
	Mukherjee, however, maintained that the 6.8 per cent fiscal deficit remained a concern.         
	The governments market borrowing via the auction of dated government securities through the Reserve Bank of India didnt meet with enough success in the first half of 2009-10.         
	As a result, the pressure on liquidity will increase in the second half. If there is any spillover of government borrowing from the first half, interest rates are likely to increase in this busy season.        
	The apprehension is already visible in the increasing yield (the return that one will get on holding the security till maturity) of the 10-year government securities.         
	Mukherjees assertion that a tight monetary policy will not be followed soon will cool the nerves of the debt market operators and hold back the yield on government securities from increasing further.

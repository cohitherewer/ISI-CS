The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Mahindra deal raises doubts
                                                                                                               Mahindra deal raises doubts
          PIYA SINGH                              
	Mumbai, April 14: Analysts are questioning Tech Mahindras ability to manage Satyam Computer Services, which it acquired yesterday by outbidding Larsen amp; Toubro and US billionaire investor Wilbur Ross.        
	Unlike Satyam, Tech Mahindra is a niche player in telecom software and overtly reliant on BT (formerly British Telecom), which provides 60 per cent of its revenues. Global brokerage CLSA said Tech Mahindra would have little recall among clients in the areas in which Satyam operated, and the Mahindra entity did not emerge as one which could conclusively stop peers from poaching Satyams customers.        
	Downgrading the company to sell from underperform, CLSA said in the last two deals with BT, Tech Mahindra had to pay upfront cash of more than $100 million for each deal. Tech Mahindras management has not been too successful in even managing its own business and had to rely on upfront payments to win business from BT, CLSA said.         
	Besides, the brokerage said the additional debt of around Rs 2,000 crore to buy Satyam would stretch Tech Mahindras balance sheet.        
	Speculation was rife that BT might sell its more-than-30-per-cent stake in Tech Mahindra. On Monday, the Tech Mahindra board dismissed such a possibility and said the 20-billion British firm was supportive of Satyams bid.         
	IDC India country manager Kapil Dev Singh said the success of the deal will depend on how well Tech Mahindra restructures and integrates two very unique cultures and wins back customer confidence.         
	CLSA was also worried about staff attrition. We understand that most Satyam employees were keen that Cognizant took over the company. Post takeover, some of Satyams incumbent top management is likely to move out, further hampering recovery.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Tug-of-war over DPSC stake sale 
                                                                                                               Tug-of-war over DPSC stake sale 
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Calcutta, March 5: Andrew Yule will call for bids to sell a 57 per cent stake in DPSC Ltd on March 10. The company claims Calcutta High Court has allowed it to complete the much awaited divestment, but DPSCs single largest shareholder, Descon Ltd, which is opposing the sale, thinks otherwise.        
	Sixteen bidders, including the Tatas, Anil Ambanis Reliance Infrastructure, CESC and JSW Energy are in the fray for DPSC, the power generator and distributor in Burdwan.        
	LIC and the United India Insurance have put 41.97 per cent along with Yules 15.2 per cent stake on the block.         
	But the process took a legal twist when Descon objected to the sale and approached the Company Law Board (CLB) alleging oppression and mismanagement by Yule and the financial institutions. The CLB in its interim order had said the sale could not be concluded. Yule went to the high court against the order.        
	When contacted, Yule chairman Kallol Datta said, according to the high court order there shall be no restrain or injunction against the divestment process and parties shall be free to continue and conclude the process.        
	We have asked the bidders to submit price bids on March 10. The final selection will be done on that day, Datta said. The sale could be concluded with the permission of the Union heavy industries ministry.        
	However, S. Radhakrishnan, managing director of both DPSC and Descon, refuted Dattas interpretation. The case has been sent back to the CLB. So its status quo. The bids can be called but the actual sale cannot be concluded unless the CLB case is settled, he said.         
	Legal experts said Justice Maharaja Sinhas order concurred with Radhakrishnans view. Justice Sinha has allowed the bidding process to continue but has restrained Yule from transferring the shares till the CLB case is settled, they said.         
	The certified copy of the order is yet to come from the high court.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Fuel price freedom plan stutters
                                                                                                               Fuel price freedom plan stutters

	New Delhi, June 7: Rising crude oil prices, at around $70 per barrel, may force the government to drop the moves towards deregulating fuel prices.        
	The petroleum ministry, which had mooted the proposal, is backtracking now as state-run oil firms demand a hike in petrol and diesel prices to compensate them for the losses resulting from the costlier crude.         
	The Union cabinet is expected to meet this week to deliberate on the fuel pricing issue, including the oil ministrys earlier proposal of deregulation as well as one on hiking prices by Rs 2 for petrol and Rs 1 for diesel.         
	PSU oil firms  Indian Oil, Hindustan Petroleum and Bharat Petroleum  are losing Rs 3.10 per litre of petrol, Rs 12 per litre of kerosene and Rs 60 per domestic LPG cylinder.         
	There is profit still on diesel  just 5 paise now from 32 paise in the middle of May. If the crude surge continues, the losses will pile up.        
	IOC, BPCL and HPCL have urged the government to hike prices as they are suffering loses of around Rs 120 crore a day because of a price cap.         
	Analysts said the new government was caught in a piquant situation. If it allowed deregulation, the oil firms will hike petrol and diesel prices.         
	On the other hand, if the cabinet decides to raise prices, it will be an unpopular move not only because the masses have enthusiastically voted back the Congress-led UPA to power but also the new government has barely started functioning and is some distance away from completing the customary honeymoon period of 100 days.        
	The other option is to delay the price rise, but this will reduce leeway to make calibrated hikes in the future in tune with rising crude prices.        
	A status quo on prices means a higher subsidy burden, which will adversely affect the fiscal deficit.         
	Petroleum minister Murli Deora has said the government will address the need to provide fuel and petroleum products at reasonable prices, while trying to meet the requirement of the oil marketing companies to run profitably and efficiently. Policy decisions in this context will be taken shortly.         
	From its peak of $142 a barrel in July last year, crude prices have touched a low of $32.40 in December. At the time of the last cuts in petrol, diesel and LPG prices in January, crude averaged $42.12 a barrel.         
	With signs of a demand revival becoming apparent in major consuming economies such as China and India, crude has started firming up.         
	The only cushion for the oil firms is the strengthening of the rupee against the dollar.         
	IOC, HPCL and BPCL have closed the financial year 2008-09 with estimated under-recoveries of Rs 1,03,908 crore on account of the subsidised sale of LPG cylinders, petrol, diesel and kerosene.         
	The trio have been compensated for their losses through government bonds and discounts by upstream oil companies such as Oil and Natural Gas Corporation Limited and Oil India Limited.

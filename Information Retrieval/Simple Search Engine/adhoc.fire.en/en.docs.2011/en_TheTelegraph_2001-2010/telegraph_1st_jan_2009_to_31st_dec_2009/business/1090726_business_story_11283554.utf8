          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Troubled times                                   
	New Delhi, July 25: A committee of secretaries today asked the finance ministry to bail out Air India by infusing fresh capital and extending soft loans.         
	It has also asked the petroleum ministry to give the beleaguered airline, which has suffered more than Rs 7,200 crore in accumulated losses, at least three more months to pay up its jet fuel dues.         
	The committee, headed by the cabinet secretary, has indicated that Air India need not pay interest on past unpaid jet fuel bills during this period.         
	The airline has also been asked to restructure incentive pay-outs to employees to cut down on its wage bill, discontinue non-viable overseas routes, leverage real estate holdings and delay aircraft purchases to reduce costs.         
	The airline has also been asked to hire a cost audit firm to help it keep tabs on its costing.         
	These decisions were taken after the airline and its merchant banker SBI Caps made a presentation before the high-level committee headed by the cabinet secretary.         
	The committee was set up to look into the financial mess the state-run carrier had landed itself in.         
	SBI Caps has chalked out a turnaround plan aimed at generating Rs 3,000 crore through internal accruals over the next six months. The plan also includes steps to mobilise additional revenue of Rs 1,800 crore by cutting costs and through savings.        
	Officials said the finance ministry had been asked to critically examine the financial assistance it can give to Air India. The airline, which has suffered over Rs 5,000 crore in losses during 2008-09, has been seeking an equity infusion of about Rs 1,250 crore and soft loans of nearly Rs 3,000 crore from the government.        
	Air India chief Arvind Jadhav told reporters after the meeting, The government is with the airline and would give full backing on its growth and cost-saving plans. The airline would keep the committee updated on these plans at its meetings to be held every month from now, Jadhav added.        
	Sources in the civil aviation ministry said the airline had been asked to defer plane purchases to save on cash outgos and interest pay-outs. Aircraft purchase will now be staggered till 2015-16, instead of being completed by 2011-12. Air India has till date inducted 51 planes out of an order of 111 Boeing and Airbus aircraft.        
	The airline has already taken loans of over Rs 16,000 crore from some 15 banks to pay for the fleet purchase. Servicing this loan has turned out to be a major liability for the airline.

	New Delhi, Nov. 1: Nissan India will launch its premium sports utility vehicle (SUV) Murano in India by the first half of next year.        
	Murano should be here latest by the first half of 2010. The car was initially scheduled for a rollout this year. It will be imported as a completely built unit from Japan, said sources.        
	The SUV is likely to be priced between Rs 35 lakh and Rs 40 lakh and will compete with the Toyota Prado, BMW X3, Mitsubishi Montero and Mercedes Benz M-class.         
	According to company sources, Nissan will first assess its prospects in the competitive SUV segment in India before getting into small cars.        
	The Murano was first launched in 2002 in the United States as a crossover vehicle to complement the Pathfinder.         
	The SUV may come in three variants  the base S, the mid-grade SL and the top of the line LE. The all-wheel drive vehicle is expected to be strapped with a 3.5-litre petrol V6 engine.        
	The Nissan Murano is likely to have aluminium interior accents, leather seats, rain sensing wipers, memory seats and mood lighting.         
	The SUV will be equipped with an 11-speaker Bose unit along with a 9.3GB hard disk storage device.         
	Nissans compact car project is also on course. The hatchback will be manufactured in five countries, including India, China and Thailand.         
	In India, the small car will be manufactured at the Renault-Nissan plant in Chennai.         
	Nissans engineers say they are trying to source 80-90 per cent of the parts locally.        
	After launching the hatchback in 2010, Nissan plans to unveil a sedan in 2011 and a compact multi-purpose vehicle.

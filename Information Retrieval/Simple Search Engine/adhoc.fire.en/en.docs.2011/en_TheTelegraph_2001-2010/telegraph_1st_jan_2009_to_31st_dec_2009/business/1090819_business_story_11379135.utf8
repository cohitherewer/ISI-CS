          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                               
	Mumbai, Aug. 18: Tata Chemicals today received a major boost in its quest to become the single largest shareholder in Rallis India, after Tata Tea agreed to sell its stake in Rallis.         
	Last week, Tata Chemicals had offered to purchase equity shares of Rallis from other associate firms, including Tata Tea, Tata Sons, Tata Investment Corporation and Ewart Investments, through inter-se transfer of shares. Tata Chemicals holds close to 9.40 per cent in Rallis and wants to buy another 35.80 per cent.         
	In a notice issued to the stock exchanges, Tata Tea said it had received an offer from Tata Chemicals to buy its stake in Rallis by way of inter-se transfer amongst qualifying promoters. At a meeting of the committee of directors of the company held today it was decided to accept the said offer, Tata Tea said.         
	Tata Tea holds 29,38,713 equity shares of Rallis India that translates into 24.52 per cent of its equity. The company said shares sold to Tata Chemicals would be subject to a ceiling of Rs 850 per share.         
	Tata Chemicals sees strong synergies from the businesses of both the firms.         
	It has a strong presence in crop nutrition, while Rallis is a leading player in crop protection.        
	Tata Chemicals is now the second largest producer of soda ash in the world with manufacturing facilities across four continents.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | RBI leaves benchmark rates intact
                                                                                                               RBI leaves benchmark rates intact
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                            
	Mumbai, July 28: The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) today left key rates  the repo rate, reverse repo and the cash reserve ratio  unchanged but sent out clear signals that it could start tightening monetary policy in the next few months to tackle inflation which is forecast to hover around 5 per cent by the end of March next year.        
	Inflation is currently running at a negative 1.1.7 per cent.         
	While the repo rate now stands at 4.75 per cent, reverse repo remains at 3.25 per cent and CRR at 5 per cent.        
	The RBI slightly revised upwards its GDP growth forecast for the year. It now expects the GDP growth at 6 per cent with an upward bias as against its April projection of a GDP growth of around 6 per cent.        
	This forecast came after the central bank considered the business outlook which has turned positive, signalling a revival of industrial activity.        
	With export demand likely to remain weak, the services sector is set to experience sluggish external demand. At the same time, a weak monsoon will exacerbate the downside risks to agricultural production.         
	As a result, the RBI believed that an uptrend in the growth momentum was unlikely before the middle of 2009-10.         
	Maintaining that it would support the return of the economy to the high growth path, the RBI said accommodative monetary stance seen since last October would continue until there were definite and robust signs of recovery.        
	However, it promised to reverse the expansionary steps quickly to anchor inflation expectations. Apart from containing inflation and the short-term compulsion of providing liquidity, the RBI said it would have to grapple with some challenges.         
	These include managing the governments borrowing programme without crowding our private credit demand and spurring private investment.        
	It felt that there was still scope for banks to bring down their lending rates.        
	As the short-term deposits contracted earlier at high rates mature and get re-priced, it opens up room for banks to further reduce their lending rates, RBI governor Duvvuri Subbarao told reporters.

	Mumbai, July 19: The Essar group is looking to invest in Dhabi Groups telecommunication assets in Africa.         
	Dhabi Group comprises a consortium of investors that includes members of the Abu Dhabi royal family.         
	According to a statement issued today, both the entities had agreed to enter into exclusive discussions in relation to an investment by Essar in the telecommunication portfolio of Dhabi Groups African assets.        
	The group offers services in countries such as Bangladesh, Pakistan, Congo and Uganda.         
	Discussions with the Essar group, however, are for the Congo and Uganda assets.         
	Officials in the Essar group said the transaction would involve an equity infusion into these businesses as growth capital.         
	The investment will enable the group to ramp up its presence in the African market.         
	Though Essar is silent on the stake share it will like to have since the discussions have just begun, it is speculated that the Ruias will look to pick up a majority stake.         
	Sheikh Nahayan Mabarak Al Nahayan of the Abu Dhabi royal family heads Dhabi Group and the consortium members include private equity investors.        
	It has diversified business interests with a focus on emerging market opportunities in financial services, telecommunication and real estate.         
	Dhabi Group has banking interests in Asia, and its portfolio was expanded in 2005 to include telecom services in Asia and Africa.        
	Other business interests include real estate development, hotels and oil-related services.         
	Standard Chartered Bank has been appointed exclusive financial adviser to the group for the proposed deal.         
	This is not the Essar groups maiden venture into the African market.         
	Essar Telecom Kenya recently became the fourth mobile operator in Kenya, launching its service under the brand name yu.         
	In India, the Essar group has a 33 per cent interest in Vodafone Essar, which is a joint venture with the Vodafone group.         
	The discussions with Dhabi Group come at a time when Sunil Bharti Mittal of Bharti Airtel is engaged in talks with MTN of South Africa to create a global telecom giant.

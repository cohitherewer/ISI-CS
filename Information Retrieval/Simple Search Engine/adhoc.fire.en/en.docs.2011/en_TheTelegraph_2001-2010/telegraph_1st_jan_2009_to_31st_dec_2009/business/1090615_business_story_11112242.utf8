The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Alcatel, Huawei eye ITI units
                                                                                                               Alcatel, Huawei eye ITI units
          JAYATI GHOSE                                    
	New Delhi, June 14: Global communications major Alcatel-Lucent and Chinese equipment vendor Huawei are likely to submit expressions of interest to buy three units of state-owned Indian Telephone Industries (ITI).        
	Last week, the government invited EoIs from global equipment makers and equity investors to acquire or pick up stakes in three of the six plants run by the loss-making telecom hardware firm.         
	Each of the six units operated by ITI can be separated and given to investors who can either enter into a joint venture or buy out the unit, said Siddharth Behura, secretary of the department of telecom. The government aims to finalise the investors in the next three months.        
	The three plants to be sold in the first round are located in Bangalore, and at Rae Bareli and Nainital. WiMax modems and transmission equipment are manufactured at the facilities. The other three units, located in Srinagar and at Mankapur in Uttar Pradesh and Palakkad in Kerala, will be sold later. We are always open to closer collaboration with our partners in India and also to help advance the local telecommunications industry with state-of-the-art network solutions, a Huawei spokesperson told The Telegraph, adding that the company does not comment on market speculation.         
	DoT officials, however, said Huawei might have to deal with security concerns raised against Chinese vendors by the intelligence agencies.         
	Huawei India is working closely with ITI to enhance transmission networks in India.         
	Alcatel-Lucent, the other interested bidder, did not respond to queries. Alcatel-Lucent already has a tie-up with ITI to use the latters production facilities at Rae Barely and Mankapur for manufacturing GSM base stations, mobile switching controllers and broadband equipment.         
	Analysts said if the government enforced the offset clause for tenders issued by BSNL and MTNL, there could be a greater interest from global equipment manufacturers in ITI. Under the offset policy, 30 per cent of all contracts (for hardware and equipment) awarded by BSNL and MTNL have to be sourced and manufactured by ITI.         
	However, the DoT has not enforced this clause in the face of opposition from MTNL and BSNL, which allege that ITI has not been able to meet the delivery schedules of the previous contracts.

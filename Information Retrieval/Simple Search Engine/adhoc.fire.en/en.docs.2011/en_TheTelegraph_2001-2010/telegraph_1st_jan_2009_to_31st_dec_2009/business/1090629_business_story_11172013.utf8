The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Wockhardt sells vet unit to French firm
                                                                                                               Wockhardt sells vet unit to French firm
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                     
	Mumbai, June 28: Wockhardt has sold its animal health division to France-based Vetoquinol for around Rs 180 crore.         
	The deal is expected to close in the second half of 2009, Wockhardt said today.         
	Vetoquinol is engaged in all aspects of animal health, from manufacturing, marketing and sales to research and development.         
	It had reported sales of 57 million euros in the first quarter of 2009, an increase of 4.4 per cent over the corresponding period of the previous year.        
	Though the beleaguered Indian pharmaceutical company did not disclose the size of the deal, it is estimated to be around Rs 180 crore.         
	The shareholders of Wockhardt had approved the divestment of the animal health division through a postal ballot on June 1.         
	The division clocked net sales of around Rs 70 crore for the year ended December 31, 2008.         
	Wockhardt said the sale of the division was part of its plan to focus on drug for humans. Wockhardt is reinventing itself by taking fundamentally strong and positive steps by restructuring and rationalising its business to raise fresh capital and gain investor confidence, the company said.         
	The sale comes days after Wockhardt sold its German business Esparma to Mova, a subsidiary of Lindopharm of Germany.         
	Wockhardt had acquired Esparma in May 2004 for $11 million. Both these sales are part of the companys plan to bring down its debt and restructure operations.         
	The Habil Khorakiwala-owned company had suffered a loss of Rs 159 crore for the year ended December 2008, and the companys net debt stood at Rs 3,400 crore.         
	According to reports, the company plans to sell part of its hospital business (Wockhardt Hospitals) and biotechnology and veterinary divisions. Speculation is rife about the sale of French subsidiary Negma and Irish subsidiary Pinewood.         
	Wockhardt had bought Negma for $265 million in May 2007 and Pinewood for $150 million in 2006.         
	Wockhardt, the countrys sixth largest drug maker by sales, is also planning to raise money to repay short-term loans and meet other liabilities.         
	Vetoquinol earns nearly 80 per cent of its revenues from outside France.

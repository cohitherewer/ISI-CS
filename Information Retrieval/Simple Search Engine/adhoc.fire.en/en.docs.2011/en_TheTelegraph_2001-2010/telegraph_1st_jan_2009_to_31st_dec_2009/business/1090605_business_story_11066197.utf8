          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Calcutta, June 4: Gujarat NRE Coke  the countrys largest non-captive metallurgical coke manufacturer  has mounted a takeover bid for a mining company in Australia.        
	Rey Resource, an Australian Securities Exchange-listed firm, said the offer was unsolicited and advised its shareholders to take no action on their holdings.        
	Gujarat NRE Minerals (GNM), a subsidiary of Calcutta-headquartered Gujarat NRE, has offered one share for every five of Rey, which values the deal at Rs 53.21 crore. The company said its bid represented a premium of about 40 per cent over the last traded value of Reys shares.        
	GNM already has a 16.7 per cent stake in Rey. Arun Kumar Jagatramka, vice-chairman and managing director of Gujarat NRE Coke, stepped down from Reys board yesterday.        
	Rey owns coal, oil and gas tenements covering a large area in Canning Basin in western Australia.         
	It has 500 million tonnes (mt) of coal resources with potential for medium-to-large-scale development as well as base metal properties in South America.        
	The takeover of Rey provides an access to additional 500mt of thermal coal resources and coal gas methane. It establishes the group as a complete coal resources company and enhance its value, Jagatramka said.         
	Putting the assets of GNM and Rey together and potentially realising the upside offered by the combined group, with its exposure to the Indian coal markets, will be a dramatic value driver for the shareholders of both the firms, he added.

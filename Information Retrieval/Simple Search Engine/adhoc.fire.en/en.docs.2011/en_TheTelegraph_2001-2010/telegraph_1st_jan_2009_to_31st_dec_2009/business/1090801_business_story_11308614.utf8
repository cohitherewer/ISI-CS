	Calcutta, July 31: City-based Rossell Tea Ltd expects its non-tea business to contribute over 50 per cent to its revenue in the next three years.         
	At present, about 10 per cent of its revenue comes from non-tea segments.         
	Tea is our core business and we will always continue with that. But other segments need to grow as well, Rossell Tea executive chairman Harsh M. Gupta said on the sidelines of the companys annual general meeting here today.        
	The company has ventured into aviation and hospitality.         
	Gupta said Rossell would invest about Rs 100 crore in these businesses over the next three years.         
	Aerotech Services, Rossells aviation arm, works with original equipment manufacturers.

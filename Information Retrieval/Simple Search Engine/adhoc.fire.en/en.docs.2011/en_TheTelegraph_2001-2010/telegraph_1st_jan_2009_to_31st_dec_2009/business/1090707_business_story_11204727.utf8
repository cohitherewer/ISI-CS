The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Inclusive growth is the buzzword
                                                                                                               Inclusive growth is the buzzword
										      Guest Column - Nikhil Advani                        
	The budget presented by the finance minister today clearly reflects the governments intention to foster a more inclusive growth oriented economic agenda, so that the masses also get a share of the development pie. Hence, various schemes to provide economic security to the common man have found pride of place in the budget  such as increased allocation for NREGA, the proposed food subsidy bill etc. These measures may be termed populist but the fact of the matter is that these steps are essential for long term sustainable growth of the economy.        
	The proposed food security law that envisages providing 25kg of rice and wheat each month at a subsidised rate of three rupees a kilo to each poor family is an important element of the social security net that the country is gradually putting into place, and deserves to be applauded.        
	The initial reactions of the markets have been negative, largely because a great deal of the expectations that were built up over the past few weeks have not been realised. But that is not to say that there is no good news for the corporate sector, or overall economic growth in the budget.         
	Infrastructure will get a boost through the 23 per cent increased allocation for highways  and this will provide a critical boost to increased economic activity across various sectors. Roads connect the producer to the consumer, and having a strong network of roads gives a multiplier effect to economic growth. More importantly, as the lifeline of commerce connecting rural production centers to the urban centers of consumption, highways are essential for bridging the India-Bharat divide. As our rural centers become increasingly more important markets for industrial products, the increased allocation to the construction of highways will clearly have a positive cascading effect on the entire economy.        
	The increased allocation for the construction of highways has been more than matched by a 59 per cent increase in the Pradhan Mantri Gram Sadak Yojana (PMGSY). This scheme provides funds the last mile connectivity to each and every village. So, with both the highways and rural road network expanding, ever-increasing parts of rural India are being integrated into the national commerce  both as producers and consumers.         
	Another important initiative in the budget has been the proposed long-distance gas highway, which will help meet the needs of the energy-deficient parts of the country.         
	Admittedly, this is not the first time that a national gas grid is being talked about. But this initiative is important to link the gas starved areas with the newly discovered major gas fields. This move will have the impact of reducing considerably Indias energy import bill, and is an important feature of the budget.         
	The increased spending on the various infrastructure schemes  highways, rural roads, irrigation, urban and rural housing schemes  will provide the necessary impetus to create additional jobs and get the economic cycles moving faster than they currently are. If the rate of our economic growth is to jump again from the 7 per cent to 9 per cent and higher, government spending will have to play an important role. The budget clearly seems to have this goal in mind.                                 
	For those of us who live in Mumbai, the budget has good news in the form of the Rs 500 crore provided for the development of the city, with an emphasis on flood alleviation measures.         
	Overall, given the challenges that the country faces in these difficult times of global economic slowdown, the budgets focus on providing protection to the most vulnerable sections of society has to be appreciated. If that has meant that there is less available for the corporate sector, that is understandable.         
	Once Corporate India reads the fine prints, it will be realised that there is enough stimulus provided for in the budget. In my mind this is a reasonably balanced budget which will benefit both the Aam Adami and the corporate India.

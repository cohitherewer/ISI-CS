The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | US govt weighs stake hike in Citi 
                                                                                                               US govt weighs stake hike in Citi 
                            
	Paris/New York, Feb. 23 (Reuters): Citigroup Inc is in talks that could see the US government boost its stake to 40 per cent, according to media reports, as governments and financial firms in Japan, France and elsewhere announced fresh capital raising on Monday.        
	The Wall Street Journal said Citigroup and US officials are discussing a plan under which the government could convert a big chunk of the $45-billion of preferred shares it bought last year.         
	The British government last month said it would convert preferred shares it took in the Royal Bank of Scotland, which is expected to announce a restructuring plan this week.         
	The US plan could see the government end up owning as much as 40 per cent of its common equity, though Citi executives hope to limit the stake to closer to 25 per cent, the newspaper reported. The preferred shares now amount to a stake of less than 8 per cent.        
	This gives you the sense that authorities worries have intensified, that problems relating to the US economy may potentially spill over to the rest of the world, said Sailesh Jha, senior regional economist at Barclays Capital in Singapore.        
	The Financial Times said Citis aim was to keep the governments stake to no more than 40 per cent, or at least below the 50 per cent mark that would spell nationalisation  which is anathema to many US politicians, executives and voters.        
	The US Treasury declined to comment on Citigroup but said it would consider converting preferred shares it owns in banks into common equity to strengthen their capital structure.        
	We are open to considering a request to do so if the institution and its regulator believe it would promote the long-term stability of that institution, and if we believe its in the best interest of long-term stability of our economy and financial system, spokesperson Isaac Baker said.         
	EU summit        
	European Central Bank president Jean-Claude Trichet said on Monday that the euro zones financial system was under severe strain and that net credit flows have started to fall in recent weeks.         
	What has become increasingly clear since the intensification of the crisis mid-September last year is that the strains in the financial sector are spilling over to the real economy, Trichet told a conference on regulation.

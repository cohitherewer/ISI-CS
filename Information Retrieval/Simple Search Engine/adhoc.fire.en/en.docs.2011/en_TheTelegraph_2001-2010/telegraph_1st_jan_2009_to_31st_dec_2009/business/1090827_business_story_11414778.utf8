The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Final call on 3G spectrum
                                                                                                               Final call on 3G spectrum
          JAYATI GHOSE                          Quick dial                                  
	New Delhi, Aug. 26: A decision on whether successful 3G bidders need to separately apply for a 2G licence could be taken tomorrow at a meeting of a group ministers that is expected to finalise the reserve price of 3G auction.        
	At present, firms buying 3G spectrum need to pay Rs 1,651 crore to obtain a unified access service licence that gives them access to 2G spectrum. Telecom ministry officials argue that an additional payment to get the licence may discourage companies from bidding. It may also frustrate foreign players who have to invest in setting up the infrastructure as well.        
	Even if serious firms are not dissuaded by the additional licence fee, the government is not in a position to give 4.4 megahertz of 2G spectrum that comes bundled with the telecom licence, and this can lead to litigations and other controversies, said the officials.        
	With the government allowing the mobile virtual network operator (MVNO) model, a standalone 3G service provider can take spectrum on lease from an existing player, in case it is exempted from paying a separate licence fee.         
	An MVNO offers voice and data services without owning spectrum and network infrastructure.        
	Global majors such as AT amp;T, Orange, Telefonica, Verizon, Sprint, France Telecom, O2 and Telestra are expected to bid for a 3G licence. However, these companies will have to tie up with a domestic player  which has infrastructure and a licence  for a faster rollout.        
	The Prime Ministers Office and the finance ministry expect 3G services to attract foreign players and generate high revenues. The government, in its budget estimates, had stated that Rs 35,000 crore would be mopped up from the auction.        
	While nothing has been finalised yet, a successful bidder may be asked to shell out a lower sum for a plain vanilla telecom licence (2G) without the bundled spectrum, said officials.        
	Third generation spectrum can be used for both voice and high-speed data applications. So, any new player winning the bid can enter the traditional voice and SMS market. At present, all telecom services are offered on 2G. The group of ministers will take a final call on the reserve price for both 3G and Wimax and decide on the number of players to be allowed in each circle.

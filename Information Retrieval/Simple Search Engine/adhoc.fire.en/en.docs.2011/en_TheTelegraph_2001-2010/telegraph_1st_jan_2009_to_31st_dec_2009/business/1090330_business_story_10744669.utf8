	Mumbai, March 29: Premium hotels in the country are going the extra mile to lure guests as the slowdown bites.        
	They are offering services that are either free with a package or available at reduced rates.         
	Hotel Leela Venture Ltd has seen lower occupancy at its properties in Kerala, Goa and Bangalore, which contribute around 38 per cent to its revenue.         
	Occupancy rates have fallen by around 10 per cent in the first three months of this year compared with the year-ago period.         
	In Bangalore, occupancy is down 8-10 per cent in the first quarter of this calendar year. However, according to Andrew Hendrian, general manager of Leela Palace, occupancy rates are healthy at over 60 per cent.         
	With the summer setting in, Hotel Leela Venture is concentrating on offering packages that are not only competitive in terms of pricing but also offer a better value-added proposition.         
	At its 185-room Goa property, it has announced a summer package priced at Rs 1,950 per day for a single person.         
	According to general manager Pascal Dupuis, this rate is lower by around 25 per cent from the peak season price.         
	On the other hand, Biswajit Chakraborty, general manager of The Leela Kempinski Kovalam Beach, is concentrating on not only being little more competitive, but also offering good package. He is targeting corporate customers by offering discounts on spa treatments.         
	Conferences are a huge contributors to our revenues during this time of the year. However, their numbers have come down. Though we are doing a customised rate reduction, the focus is more on value addition than price reduction. This may include services such as airport transfers and spa treatments among others, he said.         
	East India Hotels, too, has launched a special weekend offer at the five-star Trident hotels in Mumbai, Gurgaon and Chennai.         
	With the price starting from Rs 17,000 (excluding taxes) for a two-night stay for two persons, the package is valid for Fridays and Saturdays and includes daily breakfast for two and an additional room for up to two children below 12 years at a 50 per cent discount.         
	It has also come out with the Himalayan Vacations offer valid at The Oberoi Cecil and Wildflower Hall, Shimla.        
	At the Cecil, the package is priced at Rs 18,000 (excluding taxes) for a two-night stay. It includes accommodation for two persons for two nights in a deluxe room, daily breakfast, transfers between Shimla railway station and the hotel, and a 15 per cent discount on spa treatments.         
	The discount of 50 per cent for two children is also applicable here.         
	Trident has also come out with a holiday package across various properties in Agra, Jaipur, Udaipur, Bhubaneshwar and Cochin at a starting price of Rs 12,000.         
	The package includes daily buffet breakfast, airport transfers, unlimited Internet access in rooms and use of fitness centre, steam, sauna and pool.

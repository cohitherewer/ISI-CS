	New York, Jan. 11 (PTI): Trading in the securities of Satyam Computer Services may resume tomorrow if the New York Stock Exchange finds its assessment of the company satisfactory, but the exchange has warned that it may also suspend the shares if dealings are not advisable.         
	Trading on NYSE may resume on Monday. The NYSE notes that it may, at any time, suspend a security if it believes continued dealings in the security are not advisable, the stock exchange said. After the scandal was revealed, trading in Satyam shares was halted by the NYSE, which said it was assessing whether the firm deserved to stay on the bourses in the light of all relevant circumstances and recent filings made by the company with the US Securities and Exchange Commission.         
	On January 8, Satyam had informed the commission that Sebi was investigating the circumstances surrounding the financial irregularities alleged in the resignation letter of its chairman B. Ramalinga Raju.

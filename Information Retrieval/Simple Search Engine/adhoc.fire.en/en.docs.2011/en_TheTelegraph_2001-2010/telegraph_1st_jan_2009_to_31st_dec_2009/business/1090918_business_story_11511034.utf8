          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                               
	Mumbai, Sept. 17: ABG Shipyard is not ruling out a revision in the open offer price for Great Offshore, for whom the company is involved in a neck and neck race with Bharati Shipyard.        
	Yesterday, Bharati hiked its stake in the offshore oil services provider to 22.5 per cent and raised its offer price to Rs 560. ABGs offer price is lower at Rs 520 per share.         
	Bharati yesterday had acquired around 11 lakh shares, or 3 per cent of Great Offshore, through transactions in both the Bombay Stock Exchange and the National Stock Exchange.         
	It acquired 7.56 lakh shares on the BSE and 3.60 lakh shares on the NSE at an average price of Rs 558.80 per share and subsequently, revised the open offer price. The transaction was carried out through its sister concern Dhanshree Properties Pvt Ltd.        
	ABG holds less than 11 per cent in Great Offshore. Both the suitors have been improving their offers and acquiring shares from the market. It is felt that Bharati is keen to get close to the 26 per cent mark to have a say in the management of Great Offshore.        
	Shares of ABG gained on the stock exchanges today. On the BSE, the ABG scrip rose less than a per cent to Rs 266.10. The Bharati Shipyard stock gained 2.6 per cent to close at Rs 214.15. Great Offshore also ended in the green at Rs 566.70 on the BSE.        
	In June, Bharati had made an open offer for 20 per cent in Great Offshore for Rs 344 per share. This was countered by ABG Shipyard with a price of Rs 375. Subsequently in July, Bharati increased the price to Rs 405, which was again met with a counter offer from the rival at Rs 450.

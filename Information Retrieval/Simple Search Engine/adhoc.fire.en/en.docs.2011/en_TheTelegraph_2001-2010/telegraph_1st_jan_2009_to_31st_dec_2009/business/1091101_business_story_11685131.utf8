                                                                                                               State Bank profit rises 10%
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Good show                                  
	Mumbai, Oct. 31: The State Bank of India (SBI) today reported a 10.19 per cent growth in net profit at Rs 2,490.04 crore for the second quarter ended September 30.        
	The countrys largest bank easily beat the analysts consensus estimate of Rs 2,400 crore.        
	The bank had reported a net profit of Rs 2,259.72 crore in the corresponding period last year.        
	The better-than-expected profits came largely on account of a 50 per cent leap in other income  a factor that has underpinned robust results across the banking industry this quarter.         
	Other income of the bank grew to Rs 3,525.16 crore compared with Rs 2343.14 crore.         
	The SBI also saw a decent growth in its interest income despite challenging circumstances. Interest earned on advances grew to Rs 12,669 crore against Rs 11,482 crore in the same period last year due to a 16.39 per cent growth in its advances.        
	Net interest income  which is the difference between interest earned and interest paid  rose to Rs 5,609 crore compared with Rs 5,455 crore in the same period last year.        
	SBI chairman .P. Bhatt told reporters that the bank had beaten its peers on various parameters, including deposits, advances and fee-based income. He said the profits would have been higher had it not been for the lacklustre credit growth during the period.        
	Gross advances rose to Rs 5,80,237 crore from Rs 4,98,513 crore as of September 30, 2008, a growth of 16.39 per cent.        
	Bhatt said the banks advances would grow by 22 per cent by the end of this fiscal. He said credit growth had been flat in the first quarter and had picked up slightly since.        
	The pipeline of sanctions and undisbursed advances (at the SBI) is worth Rs 25,000 crore, he said, adding that the bank expected a sharp growth in both corporate and retail loans.        
	The SBI chief said the bank had trimmed its interest rates on new deposits and had reduced its dependence on bulk deposits. As a result, its net interest margins should improve by 10 to 15 basis points every quarter.        
	While the SBI is now planning to open around 450 branches in the country during the next six months, at least 2,000 ATMs will also be installed in the same period.        
	Replying to a query on the implication of the Reserve Bank of Indias (RBI) move to impose at least 70 per cent provisioning for non-performing assets (NPAs), Bhatt said the bank might have to make an additional provisioning of Rs 5,000 crore due to this stipulation. The bank had asked the central bank for more time in this regard.        
	The SBI board today approved the swap ratio for the merger of the State Bank of Indore with itself.        
	In todays board meeting, the board approved the swap ratio, Bhatt said without disclosing the ratio.        
	With this, the merger of SBI with State Bank of Indore, which is the smallest subsidiary of the countrys largest lender, is likely to be completed soon.

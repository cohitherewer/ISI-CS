The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Dishergarh doubt upsets Srei mood
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Dishergarh doubt upsets Srei mood
          SAMBIT SAHA                          Kanoria: Legal route                                  
	Calcutta, Dec. 3: Srei has threatened to move court and seek damages if Andrew Yule and financial institutions  the LIC and the GIC  back out of their commitment to sell their stakes in DPSC Ltd.        
	A consortium of Srei and Indian Power Corporation Ltd was the highest bidder to acquire a 57.17 per cent stake in DPSC, formerly Dishergarh Power Supply Corporation, that was put on sale by the two FIs and Yule last month.        
	However, doubts have cropped up on whether the insurance duo will sell their part of the stake as they may want to hold on to their shareholding for a higher price later.        
	Srei managing director Hemant Kanoria told The Telegraph that his company had spent considerable time and money over the last two years to participate in the auction.        
	If now they dont want to sell, we will obviously seek damages. It is they who wanted to sell and sought bid through open tender, Kanoria said.        
	According to Kanoria, the auction was carried out following the direction of Calcutta High Court and conducted by a court appointed officer.        
	While the representatives of the LIC and the GIC were present when the court gave its approval to the open bidding, they did not attend the auction on November 20.        
	It will be a complete mockery of the judicial system if the deal does not go through, Kanoria said.        
	Yule chairman Kallol Dutta said he was not aware of any change of stance on behalf of the LIC or the GIC.        
	I am expecting my ministry to approve the sale next week, he said. Dutta also rejected the view that the insurers had given only a provisional go ahead to the sale, subject to their approval to the price offered.        
	The LIC and the GIC, which hold a 41.97 per cent stake, had a tag along agreement with Yule to sell the stake, Dutta said.        
	Srei officials said since there was no reserve price fixed for the sale of the shares, the state-run insurers would not be able to raise objection to the price quoted.        
	A mail sent to the LIC on its stand went unanswered.        
	The Srei consortium had offered Rs 710 per share for the power generator. Descon, the single largest shareholder in DPSC with a 32.31 per cent stake, was the second highest bidder, quoting Rs 705 a share.        
	However, its entire holding is pledged to JSW Energy which was also one of the bidders but opted out of the race because of last minute changes in the terms .        
	The DPSC share closed at Rs 655 on the National Stock Exchange today. DPSC produces 40 MW at Dishergarh in Burdwan and sells around 150 MW over a 640-square-kilometre area in Burdwan.

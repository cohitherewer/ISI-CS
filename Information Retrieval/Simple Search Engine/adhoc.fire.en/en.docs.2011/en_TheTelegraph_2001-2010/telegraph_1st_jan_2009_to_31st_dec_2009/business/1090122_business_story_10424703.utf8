The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Crackdown on pledged shares   Sebi makes disclosure mandatory
                                                                                                               Crackdown on pledged shares     Sebi makes disclosure mandatory
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Bhave: Stern move                                        
	Mumbai, Jan. 21: The Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) has made it mandatory for promoters of listed companies to disclose details of their pledged shares.        
	The decision, taken at a Sebi board meeting held here today, comes close on the heels of the Satyam fraud case where Ramalinga Raju, the founder of the company, had pledged a large part of his shares to lenders.        
	According to the Sebi diktat, these disclosures will be of two types.         
	In event-based disclosures, the promoters will have to inform the company when shares held by them are pledged to lenders or financiers. The company will subsequently inform the stock exchanges.         
	There will also be periodic disclosures of such pledged shares. This will happen when companies disclose their shareholding pattern every quarter.        
	In the case of Satyam, the promoters could not meet their margin calls after the fall in the share price, prompting lenders to offload the pledged shares in the open market.        
	There have been other instances where lenders have sold pledged shares.         
	In the case of Orchid Chemicals and Pharmaceuticals, Religare Enterprises sold shares that promoter K. Raghavendra Rao had pledged to it.        
	Sebi chairman C.B. Bhave said the rule would come into effect after the market regulator makes necessary changes in the relevant regulations and listing agreements.        
	It will be mandatory on the part of promoters, including the promoter group, to disclose the details of pledged shares held by them in listed entities promoted by them, Bhave said.         
	The market regulator also reviewed the progress made in the investigations initiated against Satyam.

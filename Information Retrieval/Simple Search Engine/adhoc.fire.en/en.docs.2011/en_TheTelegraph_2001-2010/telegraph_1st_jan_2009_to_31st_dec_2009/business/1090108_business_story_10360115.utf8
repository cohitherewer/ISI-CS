The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Foreign funds jump off sinking ship
                                                                                                               Foreign funds jump off sinking ship
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          A broker reacts to the sensex crash in Mumbai on Wednesday. (Reuters)                                  
	Mumbai, Jan. 7: The foreign financial institutions are scooting for cover.        
	Within hours of the stunning announcement of a corporate fraud at Satyam Computer, the top foreign institutional investors in the company  Aberdeen, Swiss Finance Corporation and a couple of others  sold a huge chunk of their holdings.        
	It wasnt clear who was buying. The sales were made through bulk deals and were offloaded in the open market and they were not bought by a single buyer.        
	But the biggest surprise was that Aberdeen Asset Management  which was the biggest shareholder in the company after the Raju family stake tumbled to 3.6 per cent  was among the sellers. As on September 30, the entity through a couple of its funds held 5.12 per cent or 3.45 crore shares in the company.        
	It now seems that Aberdeen has completely exited from the company. On the BSE and NSE, it sold around 3.61 crore shares at Rs 41.82 apiece.         
	The sale is interesting as only a few days ago, a senior official with the fund had said on a business channel that it was not keen on a management change and remained positive on Satyams business.        
	Some of the other institutional investors that sold Satyam shares included Swiss Finance Corporation, which held 1.12 per cent equity, and Fidelity Management amp; Research Company. However, institutional investors such as the Life Insurance Corporation, which hold over 2.50 per cent stake in Satyam, were not among the list of sellers.        
	Institutions, comprising FIIs, mutual funds and insurance companies, are the largest holders of Satyam stock, having around 61 per cent of its equity.        
	With the Satyam stock suffering deeply on account of the disclosures made by Raju, the focus is also on both the institutional shareholders and the public. The latter holds over 7 per cent in Satyam.        
	Broking circles said while retail investors who have held on to the stock should book losses, they should not try to enter at the current levels even if the price looked attractive.        
	Institutional investors have made huge losses and there is little recourse available but sell as and when the stock bounces, an analyst with a local brokerage said.

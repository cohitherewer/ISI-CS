          OUR CORRESPONDENT                          Anil: Dispelling doubt                                  
	New Delhi, Oct. 14: Reliance Communications chief Anil Ambani today met telecom minister A. Raja to explain the companys auditing practices, under fire following allegations of irregularities by a government-appointed auditor.         
	Parekh amp; Company, the auditor, recently revealed that R-Com did not show revenues of Rs 2,799.19 crore for the financial years 2006-07 and 2007-08, costing the government Rs 315.9 crore in terms of licence and spectrum fees that are charged as a percentage of revenue.        
	DoT officials said R-Com had asked the telecom ministry to provide a copy of the audit report to assess the allegations. Sources said Ambani also met Prime Minister Manmohan Singh. However, no official confirmation was available.        
	Refuting all allegations, an R-Com spokesperson said rivals had leaked the audit report. R-Com is in full compliance with licence terms and conditions, the spokesperson said.         
	A four-member committee of the DoT will now examine the report; officials said market regulator Sebi was set to look into the accounts of R-Com. Sebi has asked the telecom ministry for details of the R-Com audit report. It may also conduct a separate investigation into the accounts of R-Com, said officials.        
	If the violations are confirmed, the telecom firm and its auditors  BSR amp; Company, a member firm of KPMG International, and Chaturvedi amp; Shah, a member firm of Nexia International  would face penalties.        
	The Institute of Chartered Accountants of India  the nodal body for regulating auditors  is also looking into the matter. We will take action against R-Coms chartered accountants if any wrongdoing is found, said Uttam Agarwal, president of the ICAI.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Gupta: Restricting act                                  
	New Delhi, Jan. 21: Worried that the erstwhile Satyam management might try to liquidate assets, the Company Law Board (CLB) today barred its founder and four others from selling shares and other properties of the company.        
	Corporate affairs minister P. C. Gupta said the CLB had asked Satyam founder B. Ramalinga Raju and four others to furnish their bank account and asset details, while restraining them from selling or pledging the companys shares till further notice.        
	They shall not alienate charge, mortgage or sell any of their shares, securities and fixed assets without the leave of the Company Law Board, he said.        
	The orders have been issued by the Company Law Board. The details have to be given in a sealed cover by February 20, the minister said.        
	Others who had been barred were Rajus brother and former Satyam managing director B. Rama Raju, former chief financial officer Vadlamani Srinivas, former executive Ram Mynampati and company secretary G.J. Jayaraman.        
	Benami firms        
	During the investigations by the CID, Raju has reportedly accepted his role in the creation of over 240 benami construction firms other than Maytas to stash away funds siphoned out of Satyam. Of these, 150 were registered with the RoC in Hyderabad in the name of either Ramalinga Rajus family members or some loyal employees of Satyam.         
	Investigations have further revealed that at least 16 of these companies were based overseas.

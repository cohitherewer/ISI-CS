The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Govt seeks solace in growth data
                                                                                                               Govt seeks solace in growth data
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                            
	New Delhi, Jan. 30: The government today drew comfort from last fiscals scorching growth pace of 9 per cent and clung to the hope that the economy would expand at the rate of 7 per cent during the current financial year despite the global slowdown.        
	Releasing the quick estimates of the major economic indicators for 2007-08, the Central Statistical Organisation (CSO) said the 9 per cent growth rate was achieved because of healthy expansion in agriculture (4.9 per cent), manufacturing (8.2 per cent), construction (10.1 per cent), trade (10.1 per cent), transport (15.5 per cent) and real estate (11.7 per cent).        
	Matching the growth pace, per capita income during 2007-08 increased 7.6 per cent to Rs 24,295.        
	However, the government feels growth for the current fiscal is expected to be lower at 7 per cent because of the slowdown caused by the global financial crisis.        
	The RBI also sees growth at 7 per cent in 2008-09, while the Economic Advisory Council to the Prime Minister has forecast 7.1 per cent expansion.        
	Buoyant growth pushed the per capita income to Rs 24,295 in real terms against Rs 22,580 in 2006-07, an increase of 7.6 per cent.         
	The per capita income at current prices is estimated at Rs 33,283 in 2007-08 against Rs 29,524 in the previous year, a growth rate of 12.7 per cent, the CSO report said.        
	Income at current prices is usually deflated by the inflation rate to get income in real terms. This is considered to be a better indicator of growth.         
	The per capita income has risen almost 60 per cent since 2003-04, the CSO said.        
	This is because the gross domestic product (GDP) has been growing faster than population, which is increasing by 1.4 per cent. The per capita income is set to continue its growth momentum in the current fiscal as the GDP rate is likely to grow faster than population growth, said D.K. Joshi, principal economist with Crisil.        
	Gross domestic savings during 2007-08 (at current prices) increased to 37.7 per cent of GDP against 35.7 per cent in the previous year.        
	However, growth in infrastructure fell 2.3 per cent in December 2008 from 3.2 per cent a year ago because of a drop in steel and crude oil output.

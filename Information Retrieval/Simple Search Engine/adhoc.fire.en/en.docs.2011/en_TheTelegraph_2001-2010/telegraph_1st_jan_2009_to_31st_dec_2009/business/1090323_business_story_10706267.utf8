                                                                                                                 Q amp;A      Loan logic
                                Income Tax Act stipulates that the aggregate amount of loan taken in cash should not exceed Rs 20,000. If I take loans from three different persons in cash, each amounting Rs 19,000, should I be liable to penalty?          M. Banerjee, Behala
                    Chapter XXB of the Income Tax Act has only three sections  269S, 269 T and 269TT  related to the mode of acceptance and repayment of loans or deposits. Under these sections, no person shall, after June 30, 1984, take from any other person any loan or deposit other than an account payee cheque or account payee bank draft if the amount of such loan or deposit is Rs 20,000 or more. The provision is about loans or deposits from one person in one year. If the aggregate of loans or deposit from one person exceeds Rs 20,000 in a year, same will come within the purview of 269SS or 269T, as the case may be. Therefore, you can receive loans below Rs 19,000 each from several parties and you shall not be liable to penalty under these sections.                                   Offset your loss       Can I set off long-term capital loss on shares or mutual funds against long-term profits on other assets, such as property or gold. If yes, can I carry forward the loss in the next financial year?         Sachin Awasthi, Calcutta
                      Under Section 10(38) of the Income Tax Act, long-term capital gain is tax-exempt in the case of shares traded through stock exchange and on which the security transaction tax is paid. This benefit is also available in the case of equity-linked mutual funds that invest at least 65 per cent of the fund corpus in shares of domestic companies. Therefore, long-term loss on sale of shares through the stock exchange is not allowed to be carried forward or adjusted with long-term capital gains from any other asset. However, long-term capital loss on shares of a private limited company sold off-market or shares listed in foreign stock exchange can be set off against the long-term gains of other assets.

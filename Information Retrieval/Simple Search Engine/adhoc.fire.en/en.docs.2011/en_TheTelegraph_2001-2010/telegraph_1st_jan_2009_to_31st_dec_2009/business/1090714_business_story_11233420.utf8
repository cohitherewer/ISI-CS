The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | SBI sees rates rising
                                                                                                               SBI sees rates rising
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                    
	Calcutta, July 13: State Bank chairman .P. Bhatt today said interest rates could harden in the next three to six months.         
	Only yesterday, finance minister Pranab Mukherjee had said the governments market borrowing of over Rs 4,00,000 crore would not push up lending rates.        
	Cost of bank finance has come down by 300 basis points since September last year and lending rates will not come down any further, Bhatt said.         
	At present, there is a deluge of liquidity  banks are everyday parking Rs 1,00,000 crore on an average with the Reserve Bank of India. But the liquidity is going to go down when the busy season kicks in. You may see interest rates firming up after Diwali by 25 basis points to 100 basis points. I wont be surprised if bank lending rates go up by more than 100 basis points, he said.        
	However, interest rates will depend on the RBIs liquidity management and monetary policy to be reviewed on July 28.         
	The RBI can reduce the cash reserve ratio (CRR) for commercial banks to release liquidity in the system and mop up money through its market stabilisation scheme (RBI sells treasury bills and dated government securities to banks) to lend to the government, Bhatt said.        
	At the end of May this year, the total outstanding under MSS stood at Rs 39,890 crore, much lower than the maximum limit of Rs 2,48,000 crore, while CRR stands at 5 per cent.        
	At the customary post-budget meeting with the finance minister on Saturday, RBI governor D. Subbarao had said, The increased fiscal deficit had raised the size of government borrowing significantly.         
	However, he said the RBI would try to manage the situation in a non-disruptive manner.        
	Banks, according to experts, will be forced to increase their lending rates because their net interest margin is becoming thinner since the beginning of the current calendar year.         
	Our net interest margin was 3.16 per cent in December last year and now it has come down to 2.32 per cent, Bhatt said. We also need a 3 per cent margin for survival. How far can banks reduce their lending rates and take a hit on the net interest margin? he said.

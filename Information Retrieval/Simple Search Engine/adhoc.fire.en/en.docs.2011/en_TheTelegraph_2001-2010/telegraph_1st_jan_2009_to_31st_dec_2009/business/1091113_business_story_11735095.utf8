	New Delhi, Nov. 12: The government today allowed ONGC Videsh Ltd  the overseas arm of state-run Oil and Natural Gas Corporation  to invest an additional Rs 322 crore in an oilfield in Brazil.        
	The approval of the cabinet committee on economic affairs (CCEA) will raise the total investment in the project to Rs 1,762 crore, home minister P. Chidambaram said.        
	The investment is towards exploiting the oil reserves in a block off the Brazilian coast.        
	Oilfields in the BC-10 block are being developed in two phases.         
	The first-phase cost has gone up Rs 1,444 crore to Rs 10,497 crore, while the cost in the second phase remains at Rs 5,501 crore.         
	The CCEA has also authorised an additional sum of Rs 81 crore for future use in case of a cash deficit.         
	Chidambaran said Royal Dutch Shell, the operator of the BC-10 project, had informed OVL that the cost had gone up because of taxes, duties and additional well expenditure.        
	The BC-10 block is located in the Campos basin off the coast of Brazil.         
	Shell holds a 50 per cent stake, while Petrobras of Brazil has 35 per cent. OVL holds the remaining 15 per cent.

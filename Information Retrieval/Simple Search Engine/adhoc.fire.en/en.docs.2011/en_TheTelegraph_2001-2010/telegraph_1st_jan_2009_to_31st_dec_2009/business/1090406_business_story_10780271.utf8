The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | PM panel lowers growth estimate
                                                                                                               PM panel lowers growth estimate
                                          
	New Delhi, April 5 (PTI): The Prime Ministers economic advisory panel has lowered the growth estimate for 2008-09 to 6.5-7 per cent from 7.1 per cent as exports contracted more than expected.        
	It (growth rate for 2008-09) may go somewhere between 6.5-7 (per cent), that is the current estimate of 7.1 per cent has to be lower. This is because contraction of trade turned out to be much greater than anticipated, Suresh Tendulkar, chairman of the economic advisory council, said.        
	In January, the panel revised downwards its growth projection to 7.1 per cent for 2008-09 from 7.7 per cent because of painful adjustments to the abrupt changes in international economy.        
	The Central Statistical Organisations advance estimates  the official estimate  have kept the growth rate at 7.1 growth for 2008-09.        
	Tendulkar said the global crisis affected the Indian economy through export and export-related industries and capital outflows.         
	There was deeper than expected recession in advanced countries. The psychology of gloom and doom, which was essentially pervaded in the industrialised countries was imported to this country, Tendulkar said.        
	The domestic financial markets are also integrated with the rest of the world and so they were also hit, he said.        
	To boost the economy, the government came out with three stimulus packages with incentives to various sectors.

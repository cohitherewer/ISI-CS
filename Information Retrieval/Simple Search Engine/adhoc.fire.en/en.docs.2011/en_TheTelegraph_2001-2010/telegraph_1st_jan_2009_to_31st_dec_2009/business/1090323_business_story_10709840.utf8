	Mumbai, March 22: Tata Tea, the worlds second-largest branded tea company, is planning to restructure the operations of its subsidiaries depending on the geographies in which these are located.         
	The company is also developing a common brand identity for products such as tea, bottled water and other beverages.        
	Tata Teas board of directors is scheduled to meet on Tuesday to deliberate on the proposals to restructure business operations of some of the companys subsidiaries.         
	The management is keen to cut costs by maximising synergies between the parent and the various subsidiaries. This could be achieved by restructuring the distribution network, including sales and marketing, streamlining procurement methods or consolidating manufacturing operations wherever possible.        
	The board will also consider a new brand identity for products from the Tata Tea stable that will focus on the wellness and environment-friendly platform.        
	Over the past decade, the company has been making efforts to shed the image of a plantation company and position itself as a global contemporary beverages firm with an emphasis on health and wellness.        
	Whether it is tea, green tea extracts, bottled water or the launch of the cold drink T!ON, the company has been slowly building on the health and wellness positioning. It has engaged some former Coca Cola executives to help in the branding exercise. Tata Tea, however, refrained to comment on the proposals, which are likely to be discussed at Tuesdays board meeting.         
	We cannot comment before the board deliberates on these issues. Besides, some of the entities concerned are listed on the bourses, Tata Tea executive director Sangeeta Talwar told The Telegraph.        
	Tata Tea has a plethora of wholly owned subsidiaries both in the United Kingdom arising from its buyout of the marquee brand Tetley, and in North America where it made a few acquisitions.         
	Tata Tea has bought Good Earth in the US and its subsidiary Tata Coffee also acquired Eight clock Coffee in the region. In India, beside tea and coffee, it has interests in bottled water after acquiring a 32 per cent stake in Mount Everest Mineral Water, which sells the Himalayan brand. It has also forayed into cold drinks.        
	The extent to which operations will be restructured is not yet clear. However, it is learnt that the Tata Tea management is keen to get this exercise off the ground in an environment where cutting costs can be critical.        
	In the US, each of the Tata beverages has individual regional distribution strengths and occupies different retail formats.         
	Tetleys ready-to-drink products have pockets of good distribution in the north-east areas of Boston and New England as well as in the southwest. However, it doesnt have a robust presence on the west coast. Good Earth, which makes speciality teas, is popular on the west coast, but a marginal player in the east.        
	There is a possibility of some realignment here.

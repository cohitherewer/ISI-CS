                                                                                                               Consensus on rate relief   Move to spruce up demand
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                                  Pranab Mukherjee with chief executives of public sector banks in New Delhi on Monday. Picture by Rajesh Kumar      
	New Delhi, Feb. 2: Chief executives of state-run banks today agreed to the governments proposals on rate cuts and more loans, which are expected to spur demand.        
	The decision was taken at a meeting of PSU bank bosses with external affairs minister Pranab Mukherjee, who is in charge of finance in Prime Minister Manmohan Singhs absence.        
	After the meeting, some banks have cut rates, while others have expressed their willingness.        
	Real estate, construction and auto, among others, are expected to benefit.         
	The deposit rates have moderated. So, there is a general expectation that interest rates will also come down, finance secretary Arun Ramanathan said after the meeting.        
	Last week, Punjab National Bank (PNB) slashed its benchmark prime lending rate (PLR) by 50 basis points to 11.5 per cent, the lowest in the country. PLR of most public sector banks varies between 12 per cent and 12.5 per cent.        
	PNB chief K.C. Chakrabarty today said, There is adequate scope for a 200-basis-point reduction in lending and deposit rates on the back of the central bank slashing policy rates.         
	The State Bank of India, the countrys largest bank, said it was considering a cut. There is a thinking (on the lines to reduce the benchmark prime lending rate), said SBI chairman .P. Bhatt. The bank is open to a cut of 25 basis points.         
	Uco Bank today reduced its prime lending rate to 13 per cent from 13.5 per cent.        
	Corporation Bank was the next in line to cut rates. We are reducing interest rates on retail, housing, education, auto and personal loans by 50 to 100 basis points from tomorrow, J.M. Garg, chairman of Corporation Bank, said.        
	Finance ministry officials said smaller state-run banks were expected to follow suit.        
	However, most PSU banks are not sure of meeting the governments demand of a 50-100-basis-point cut as this involves a reduction in their deposit rates, which they are not willing to do.

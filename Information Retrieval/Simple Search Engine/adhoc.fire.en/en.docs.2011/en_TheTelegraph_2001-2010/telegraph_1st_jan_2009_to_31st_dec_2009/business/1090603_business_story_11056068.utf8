The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Hind Petro quarterly net profit zooms 
                                                                                                               Hind Petro quarterly net profit zooms 
                            
	New Delhi, June 2 (PTI): Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Ltd today reported an eye-popping 1237 per cent jump in net profit for the fourth quarter of 2008-09 on the back of good refining margin and oil bonds to cover for fuel losses.        
	Net profit in the January-March quarter of 2008-09 was Rs 5,104.04 crore compared with Rs 381.51 crore a year earlier, HPCL chairman Arun Balakrishnan said after the companys board meeting.        
	The company got Rs 2,034 crore worth of oil bonds in the fourth quarter and another Rs 559 crore from upstream firms like ONGC to cover for the revenue loss on selling petrol, diesel, domestic LPG and kerosene at a government-prescribed price rather than at cost.        
	The government fully compensated us for the losses on fuel sales. In fact, we got about Rs 700 crore of more bonds (than the revenue loss in the fourth quarter), B Mukherjee, director (finance) of HPCL, said.        
	The company earned $9.52 on processing every barrel of crude oil in the fourth quarter against $7.40 per barrel a year ago.        
	Net sales, however, fell to Rs 25,154.21 crore from Rs 31,470.61 crore.        
	For the full year, HPCL reported a net profit of Rs 574.98 crore against Rs 1,134.88 crore in 2007-08. Net sales increased to Rs 1,24,752.42 crore from Rs 1,04,703.76 crore.        
	Gross refining margin was lower at $3.97 per barrel against $6.54 a barrel last year.        
	Balakrishnan said HPCL got Rs 14,692.77 crore worth of oil bonds in 2008-09 and another Rs 7,176.95 crore from upstream firms like ONGC by way of discount on the crude oil it buys from them.

	Calcutta, April 10: Tata Steel has chalked out a plan to save 1 billion in its European subsidiary Corus during the current fiscal.        
	The company is undertaking a series of measures  divestment, asset restructuring, an efficiency programme and a overhead review  to cut operational costs as demand has tumbled in the developed nations because of the economic crisis.        
	We have managed to save 638 million during the last fiscal. This year the target has been raised to 1 billion, B. Muthuraman, managing director of Tata Steel Group, said at a press meet in Calcutta today.        
	Tata Steel bought Corus in early 2007 for $13 billion  the biggest ever acquisition by an Indian company.        
	Corus is expected to use 67 per cent of its capacity this fiscal compared with 75 per cent in 2008-09.        
	As a result, the operations in Europe are being realigned. Salaries have been cut by withdrawing overtime and bonuses, while jobs will be trimmed.         
	In Germany, Corus has decided to sell its aluminium smelters. The steel making operations in the UK are also being restructured.        
	Corus will also save by reworking raw material cost. As operation remains low, the company needs to buy less raw material and save on expenditure.         
	Unlike Tata Steel, Corus does not own raw materials such as coal and iron ore, which reduces its profitability.        
	While accepting the challenges on the operational front, Muthuraman exuded confidence about the finances of the company.        
	We do not have any re-payment on long-term loans taken for the Corus buy till the end of 2009, he said.         
	The Indian business of Tata Steel continues to be strong. Muthuraman said the demand for steel in India was expected to grow 4 per cent this year, and Tata Steels sales would grow 20 per cent. Two million tonnes (mt) of capacity has been added at Jamshedpur, which will improve the companys performance.        
	The capacity at Jamshedpur will eventually go up to 10mt after an addition of 3mt at a cost of Rs 15,000 crore. Tata Steel has already arranged funds for the expansion, which is expected to be completed by April 2011.        
	Muthuraman said the company had acquired an iron ore mine in South Africa with a reserve of 50mt. The mine will start production from 2010 and initially supply 2mt a year to Corus.

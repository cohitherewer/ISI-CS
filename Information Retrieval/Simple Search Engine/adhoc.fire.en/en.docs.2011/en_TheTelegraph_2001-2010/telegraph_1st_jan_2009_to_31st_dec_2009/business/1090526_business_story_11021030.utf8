          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Sharad Pawar in New Delhi on Monday. (PTI)                                  
	New Delhi, May 25: The Manmohan Singh-government is likely to introduce populist measures such as giving 25kg wheat or rice to households below the poverty line (BPL) at subsidised rates and cheaper credit to farmers.        
	However, the government has not decided the price at which the BPL families will get the foodgrain, agriculture and food minister Sharad Pawar told reporters while taking charge of the ministry today.        
	The minister said the farm loan waiver programme of the previous government  of over Rs 70,000 crore  had helped to address the miseries of around 40 million people.        
	But 40 per cent of our farmers are still outside the organised credit system and need support. The cost of credit is among the lowest in the world, but there is scope for further reduction. We may soon take up a proposal in the Cabinet, he said. The farmers are given credit at 6-7 per cent rates.        
	Pawar said that minimum support prices had encouraged farmers to produce more. The Food Corporation of India has purchased a record 23.3 million tonnes of wheat as of today against 22.6 million tonnes in the entire procurement season last year. Rice procurement of 29 million tonnes has been achieved so far this season against 28.5 million tonnes last year.

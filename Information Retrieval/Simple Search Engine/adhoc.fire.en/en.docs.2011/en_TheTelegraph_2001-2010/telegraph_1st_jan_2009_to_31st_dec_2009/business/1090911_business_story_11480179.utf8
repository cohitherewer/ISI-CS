The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Reliance keen to up KG supply
                                                                                                               Reliance keen to up KG supply
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                            
	Mumbai, Sept. 10: Reliance Industries has sought permission to supply more gas from its KG-D6 field to a bunch of priority customers who have been cherry-picked by the government.        
	In a letter to the petroleum ministry, RIL president (gas business) R.P. Sharma said the company wanted to increase supplies as the gasfields production capacity had risen to 60 million cubic metres of gas a day (mcmd) and will shortly cross 80mcmd.        
	Allocations from the KG-D6 field were decided on the basis of a gas utilisation policy framed by an empowered group of ministers in January.        
	Of the five priority sectors chosen by the government to receive the gas, power has been allocated the highest quantity at 18mcmd with a fallback supply option of another 11mcmd.        
	Customers such as NTPC, Dabhol and Essar Power are yet to draw 6.95mcmd. RIL wanted 11mcmd of gas currently being sold to specific power plants on a fallback or a temporary basis to be converted into firm allocations.        
	The trouble is that the government has permitted gas supplies on a priority basis to these power plants only till September 30  and that too linked to a 60 per cent plant load factor (PLF).         
	PLF is an efficiency metric for power plants.        
	The Anil Ambani side has accused RIL of hoarding the gas since there are no customers at the government-mandated gas price of $4.20 per million British thermal unit (mBtu).        
	By writing this letter, RIL is trying to assert that there are customers for its gas at the price set by the government  and that it is being constrained by the restrictive allocation policy.        
	RIL has made two major demands in its letter: first, it wants the government to allow more gas sales to existing power plant consumers so that they can operate at a higher efficiency level of 90 per cent PLF which would warrant greater gas consumption.        
	It also wants the ministry to allow gas supplies to the consumers in the power sector on a priority basis for up to five years. At present, the contracting priority for the power plants is valid only till September 30.        
	In view of the increased gas availability, we request that all the allocations be extended till the validity of the contract, that is, five years, at 90 per cent PLF level, Sharma said in the letter addressed to Apoorva Chandra, joint secretary in the petroleum ministry.        
	Second, it wants to sell gas to captive power consumers along the gas pipeline, which will be able to consume another 8-10mcmd.        
	Since captive power plants have already been identified as one of the priority sectors, we request you to allow us to supply gas to these captive plants on a fallback basis, the letter said.         
	At the same time, the letter said the gasfield would soon be ready to raise its production capacity to 80mcmd and urged the government to prepare for such a scenario.        
	We once again request you to make additional allocations to these customers which will enable us to increase the production of gas from the KG-D6 block to 80mcmd, Sharma said.        
	Pact with NTPC        
	NTPC is likely to sign a deal with Reliance to buy the allotted KG basin gas at $4.20 per mBtu by the end of this month.        
	In all likelihood, NTPC will sign the gas sales and purchase agreement with RIL by this month end. NTPC will use the gas at plants other than Kawas and Gandhar, which were initially identified for using the fuel, power secretary H.S. Brahma told reporters in New Delhi.        
	NTPC has been allocated 2.67mcmd of gas from RILs KG basin. It will use the fuel at its Anta, Dadri and Faridabad power plants.

	Calcutta, Dec. 11: Bharti Retail  a wholly owned subsidiary of Bharti Enterprises  seeks to cross the Rs 1,000-crore turnover mark by December 2011 when it completes three years.        
	The company, which is present in north India, plans to expand either towards the south or the west, Rajan Bharti Mittal, vice-chairman and managing director of Bharti Enterprises, said on the sidelines of a Ficci programme here today.         
	The company will have 70 stores by 2009-end, he said.        
	Our target is to have 200 stores by December 2010, most of which will be Easyday stores and about 8-10 will be cash and carry ones. From January 2011, we will expand our footprint to another zone. It may be either the southern or the western zone. We are yet to take a final call, Mittal said.         
	However, he refused to disclose the investment for the first three years.         
	The firm had said it would invest $2 billion by 2017 in the country. It has launched Easyday neighbourhood stores in Punjab, Haryana, Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh and Delhi, and compact hypermarkets called Easyday market in Punjab.         
	It operates in the cash and carry format in a joint venture with Wal-Mart.        
	The Easyday stores are spread across 30,000 square feet and offer over 15,000 products, including fashion brands such as George and Astitva, electronic goods, electrical appliances, mobile phones, and food and grocery items.        
	Around 16 per cent of the products sold by these shops are private labels, which are items that carry the name of the store.        
	The global benchmark is that private label products should vary between 20 per cent and 40 per cent of the total products in an organised retail store. Now, we have 16 per cent private label products of all items and our target is to increase them to the global benchmark level by December 2011, Mittal said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Condition set for cheaper overseas calls
                                                                                                               Condition set for cheaper overseas calls
          JAYATI GHOSE                          Tariff cushion                                  
	New Delhi, March 8: Telecom firms are willing to cut ISD rates if the regulator allows them to raise the termination charge on incoming overseas calls. ISD is international subscribers dialling and relates to calls from India to abroad.        
	Telecom firms can earn Rs 5,000 crore annually from incoming international calls if the termination charges are increased. The additional revenue can be used for rural rollout as well as for reducing overseas call rates for domestic customers, said a senior official from a top telecom firm.        
	The Telecom Regulatory Authority of India is studying a proposal made by Bharti Airtel, Vodafone Essar and Idea Cellular seeking changes in termination charges.        
	The termination charge is a fee paid by an operator from whose network a call originates to an operator on whose network the call ends.        
	At present, domestic players cannot take more than 30 paise a minute from foreign telecom firms for bringing calls into India. However, foreign operators, on an average, charge Indian telecom companies about Rs 3 per minute to terminate calls in their country.        
	The operators added that the high ratio of incoming calls from other countries should be used to earn foreign exchange. India gets three minutes of overseas calls for every minute of ISD traffic it sends out.        
	For the next fiscal, we will pay $604 million more to international carriers even though we will receive 16 billion minutes more than we send out, said private operators in a meeting with Trai.        
	For 2009-10, India will send out 9 billion minutes of calls at an average (termination) rate of 8.8 cents per minute, totalling $792 million. The country will receive about 25 billion minutes of calls and at the current termination rate of 0.75 cents will get a revenue of about $188 million.         
	The present regulatory regime in India has reduced revenue from incoming international calls, while there has been a significant increase in the outflow of revenue to other countries as foreign telecom firms have not reduced their termination charges. This has not only adversely affected the financial viability of service providers in India but also deprived the country of valuable foreign exchange worth Rs 4,000-5,000 crore per annum, said BSNL in a communication to Trai.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Nath sees growth recovery
                                                                                                               Nath sees growth recovery
                            
	New Delhi, March 1 (PTI): Commerce and industry minister Kamal Nath today said the worst was over for the Indian economy and growth would pick up momentum in the last two months of this fiscal.        
	I believe the worst is over, Nath said, adding that the last two months of the current fiscal would be much better in terms of growth.        
	The Indian economy grew at a five-year low of 5.3 per cent in the third quarter against 8.9 per cent a year ago because of contraction in agriculture and manufacturing output.        
	Farm sector contracted 2.2 per cent, while manufacturing shrank 0.2 per cent.        
	Growth in April-December was 6.9 per cent against the government estimate of 7.1 per cent.        
	Nath said the government had announced the stimulus packages because it was aware of the sluggish growth in the economy during October-December. We did not know the figures but certainly we were seized that there was a sharp decline. That is why we announced a stimulus package, Nath said.

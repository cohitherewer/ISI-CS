	New Delhi, May 27: Mangalore Refinery and Petrochemicals Ltd  a subsidiary of ONGC Ltd  is close to reaching an agreement with Cairn on the price it will pay for the latters crude from Rajasthan.        
	I can only say the differences have been narrowed down and we are very close to reaching finality, R.S. Sharma, chairman of Mangalore Refinery, said.        
	Cairn has made a substantial climb-down from its decision of not giving any discounts to agreeing to 15-16 per cent discount, he said.        
	Rahul Dhir, chairman and managing director of Cairn India, said, Crude output from the Rajasthan fields will begin by this month-end and price discussion was not a constraint to production.        
	Cairn India today reported a consolidated net profit for the fourth quarter ended March 31, 2009 at Rs 18.68 crore, which is 84 per cent lower than Rs 116.43 crore last year, following a drop in crude prices.        
	The government has found buyers in Indian Oil, Hindustan Petroleum and Mangalore Refinery for 2.4 million tonnes (mt) of the 8.75mt peak output of Cairn. It will produce 1.5mt in 2009-10, but the three firms are willing to take no more than 0.7mt.         
	MRPL, which posted more than two-fold growth in net profit at Rs 607.62 crore, will buy 0.2mt crude from Cairn in 2009-10 and 0.4mt in the next fiscal, managing director Uttam Kumar Basu said.

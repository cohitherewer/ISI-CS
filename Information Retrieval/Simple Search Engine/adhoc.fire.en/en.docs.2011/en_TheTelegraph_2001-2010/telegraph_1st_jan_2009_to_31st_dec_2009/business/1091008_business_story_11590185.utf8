                                                                                                               Check on onion prices
          JAYANTA ROY CHOWDHURY                          HARD BARGAIN                                  
	New Delhi, Oct. 7: The government has increased the minimum export price for onions by $ 85 to $300 a quintal, after local rates nearly doubled in just over a week.        
	It is expected that a higher benchmark price will make onions dearer in the overseas market and hence discourage exports.        
	High domestic prices of onions have always been a politically sensitive issue  it toppled the BJP-led governments of Delhi and Rajasthan around 11 years back and will be a key factor in the upcoming Assembly elections.         
	States such as Maharashtra and Haryana are going to the polls later this month. Both the Centre and the state governments are taking various measures to control the prices of sensitive food items.         
	Onion prices have risen from Rs 15 a kg in Delhis retail market to Rs 25-30 a kg in the last 10 days and from Rs 10 a kg in the wholesale market to Rs 17 a kg. The government may even consider an export ban or another hike in the benchmark export price, if the current trend continues.         
	Officials in the consumer affairs ministry said the floods in south India disrupted onion supplies and traders jacked up prices disproportionately.         
	Onion exports in September fell to 94,836 tonnes from 134,040 tonnes a year earlier because of a strong domestic demand and higher shipments from Pakistan.         
	However, India has so far exported 991,000 tonnes of onions this fiscal, far higher than 915,000 tonnes a year earlier.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Mutuals sow seeds of hope
                                                                                                               Mutuals sow seeds of hope
                            
	New Delhi, April 19 (PTI): Mutual funds are sitting on a cash pile of Rs 18,227 crore, which is enough to maintain buying interest and propel the stock market forward, says analysts at brokerage firm Sharekhan.        
	The total cash with the MFs, including the cash mobilised through the recently-launched new fund offers, stands at Rs 18,289 crore, Sharekhan said.        
	During March, mutual funds invested heavily in the stock market to capitalise on the current low levels of the scrips. Cash levels declined 8.9 per cent to Rs 18,227 crore in March 2009.The decline in the cash level on a month-on-month basis indicates an improvement in the buying activity of MFs to capitalise on rock-bottom valuations, the brokerage said.        
	In March, equity MFs registered a net inflow of Rs 337 crore against a net outflow of Rs 189 crore in February.        
	Meanwhile, US-based global equity research group Elliott Wave International has said that sensex will touch 1,00,000 in 15 years.

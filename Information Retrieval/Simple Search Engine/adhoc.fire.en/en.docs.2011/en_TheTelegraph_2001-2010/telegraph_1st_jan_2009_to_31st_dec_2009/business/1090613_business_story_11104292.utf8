The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Industry rebound lifts mood
                                                                                                               Industry rebound lifts mood
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                            
	New Delhi, June 12: After four months of contraction, industry grew 1.4 per cent in April as domestic demand improved and the governments stimulus measures began to have an impact, raising hopes of a recovery.        
	The worst is over, that is what I have been saying. The worst is over for the economy. There are signs of recovery in the data, said Suresh Tendulkar, the head of the Economic Advisory Council to the Prime Minister.        
	We have bottomed out and we are on a path of recovery, Govinda Rao, another member of the council, said.        
	However, certain crucial sectors such as consumer non-durables, including processed food products, and capital goods posted negative growth. Processed food items declined by a massive 34 per cent.        
	Besides, the 1.4 per cent growth in industrial output was much lower than the 6.2 per cent growth in April 2008.        
	The surprising number in the index of industrial production data was electricity generation, which grew 7.1 per cent against 1.4 per cent a year ago.         
	Consumer durables growth jumped to 16.9 per cent from 3.2 per cent a year ago.        
	Both manufacturing and mining reported lower growth. Manufacturing growth fell to 0.7 per cent from 6.7 per cent, while mining growth was 3.8 per cent against 6.1 per cent in April 2008.         
	Consumer non-durable output, on the other hand, contracted 10.4 per cent against 10 per cent growth in the same month a year ago.         
	The growth rate of capital goods production was 1.3 per cent against 2.4 per cent a year ago.         
	Industry had grown merely 2.6 per cent in the last fiscal against 8.5 per cent in the previous year.        
	The data was not unexpected as the core sector figures had already pointed towards a positive number. The economy is showing signs of bottoming out as government stimulus measures lead to strong growth in cement and construction sectors, said D. K. Joshi, principal economist at rating agency Crisil.        
	Global rating firm Moodys said the figures pointed towards stabilisation in industry.        
	In a research report, Goldman Sachs said the growth was above its expectations. Goldman expected a pickup in activity in the second half of this fiscal.

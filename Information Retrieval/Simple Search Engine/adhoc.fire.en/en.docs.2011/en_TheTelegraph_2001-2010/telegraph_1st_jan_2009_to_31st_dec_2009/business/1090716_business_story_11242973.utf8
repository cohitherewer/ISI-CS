The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Treasury tonic for banks
                                                                                                               Treasury tonic for banks
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Mumbai, July 15: Banks will have to rely on robust gains from their treasury operations to prop up their bottomlines in the first quarter of 2009. Blame it on the economic downturn that has slowed credit offtake and crimped profit margins on their core business.         
	HDFC Bank, the countrys second largest private sector lender, easily beat the Streets expectations by reporting a net profit growth of 31 per cent for the quarter ended June 30. But the bank said its net interest income had risen just 8 per cent. Net interest income (NII) is the difference between that earned from lending and that paid on liabilities such as deposits. Analysts had expected HDFC Bank to post an NII growth of at least 10 per cent.        
	A banks NII is a function of its asset growth. The economic slowdown has hurt demand for credit and, therefore, impacted the banks core income.         
	Recent data have put the banking sectors credit growth at around 16 per cent. This is down from 17.5 per cent in the fourth quarter of 2008-09 and around 26 per cent in the first quarter of 2008-09.        
	Says Bhavesh Kanani, banking analyst at Sharekhan, NII growth for the banking sector as a whole is likely to soften compared with the fourth quarter of 2008-09.        
	The impact of lower credit growth numbers was visible in HDFC Bank.         
	The banks balance-sheet growth further decelerated, with advances growing 7 per cent year-on-year and deposits growing 11 per cent year-on-year, which were slower than industry growth rates. Consequently, growth in NII at 8 per cent was lower than expected, said Vaibhav Agrawal, vice-president and banking analyst at Angel Broking.        
	Bankers, however, say the industrys bottomlines are unlikely to be severely affected as treasury profits are likely to be strong. Yields on government securities, especially short-term bonds, have fallen sharply during the first quarter of this fiscal. They had risen in the same period last year.

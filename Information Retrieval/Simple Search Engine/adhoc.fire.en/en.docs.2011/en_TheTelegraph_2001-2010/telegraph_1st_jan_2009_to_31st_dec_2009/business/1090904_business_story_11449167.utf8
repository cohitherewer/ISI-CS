The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Dunlop to be back on track
                                                                                                               Dunlop to be back on track
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Calcutta, Sept. 3: Tyre maker Dunlop today signed a pact with the Bengal electricity distributor to pay back old dues, paving the way for restarting the Sahagunj plant in Hooghly.        
	The unit is lying idle for five months in the absence of electricity, leaving the fate of 1,189 workers uncertain. The company now expects to begin production around the Pujas. The West Bengal State Electricity Distribution Company has agreed to resume supply after Dunlop pays its first instalment.         
	Bengal industry minister Nirupam Sen, who was instrumental in facilitating the agreement, welcomed the development. I am happy. Hopefully, production will start soon. There are some workers dues left. I expect the management will clear them as the plant starts operations, Sen told The Telegraph.         
	Dunlop will clear dues of Rs 13.4 crore over a period of nine years. Dunlop chairman Pawan Ruia said the plant would start production within two weeks after power was restored. We are debating whether to start the plant for a couple of days now and then close again or begin after the Pujas, he said.         
	So far, 229 workers have been called back. The rest 1,189 will be taken in as the company ramps up production. Dunlop had run up the electricity bill when the plant was closed under the previous Chhabria management. During 2000-05, power was consumed by local families and small industries around the plant. The distributor did not disconnect the supply, fearing a political backlash.

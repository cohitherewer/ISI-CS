The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Tatas plan to shed 5000 jobs in UK
                                                                                                               Tatas plan to shed 5000 jobs in UK
                            
	London, Jan. 25 (PTI): The Tatas are expected to cut 5,000 jobs at their steel and auto subsidiaries in the UK  Corus and Jaguar Land Rover (JLR)  in the coming weeks.        
	About 3,500 jobs are anticipated to be slashed at Corus this week itself, while JLR is expected to see another 1,500 layoffs in the coming weeks, The Sunday Times has reported.         
	Britains largest steel maker Corus is poised to cut up to 3,500 jobs this week in one of the biggest blows yet to the faltering manufacturing sector. Further large-scale job losses are expected within weeks, with JLR understood to be considering another 1,500 layoffs, the newspaper said.        
	Tata Steel had purchased Anglo-Dutch steel maker Corus for about 6.7 billion in 2007. Tata Motors had snapped up car maker Jaguar Land Rover last year for more than $2 billion from the US auto major Ford. The report stated that job cuts at Corus were likely to overshadow this weeks announcement by Lord Mandelson, the business secretary, of aid for the car industry.        
	The UK government is expected to come up with assistance to boost the countrys car industry hit by the economic downturn.         
	It is understood the planned job cuts (at Corus) will come across the companys 23,000-strong British workforce, and are not expected to lead to the closure of any large sites, the report said.        
	Quoting one industry insider, The Sunday Times said, This is not about site closure. This is about making Corus in the UK competitive.        
	The report said the union leaders had been in last-ditch talks with the government to fend off some of the job cuts.        
	In the case of Corus, they have pressed ministers to adopt a system offered by the Dutch government. Corus has operations in the Netherlands, where the state makes up the pay of workers put on short working weeks, the report stated.

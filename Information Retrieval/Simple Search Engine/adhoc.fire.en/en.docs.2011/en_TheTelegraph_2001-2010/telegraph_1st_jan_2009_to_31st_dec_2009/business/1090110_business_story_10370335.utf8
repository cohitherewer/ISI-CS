	Calcutta, Jan. 9: Bengal is ready to offer more land to Satyam and will not ask the company to return the 2.77 acres already allotted at Salt Lakes Sector V four years back, IT minister Debesh Das said today.         
	The company had asked for another 25 acres to set up an infotech SEZ here.        
	The 2.77-acre plot is already allotted to Satyam, they now own it. We cannot take back the land, Das said.         
	The company has repeatedly told the government that it is serious about Calcutta, though the plot has been lying unutilised since the foundation was laid on February 24, 2004.        
	We have already identified land in Rajarhat. We will definitely give it if they want. Why should we pull out? Raju is gone, but the company is there. Let us see what happens to it, Das said.         
	Satyam founder chairman Ramalinga Raju had asked for the additional 25 acres in November last year when he came to the city to attend the Nasscom meet.        
	Land to Infy, Wipro        
	Bengal is ready with the plots for Infosys and Wipro, Das said. Both companies have signed MoUs with the state for 90 acres each near Rajarhat.        
	We are constantly in touch with them and waiting for them to take a final call, Das said.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                            
	Mumbai, Dec. 23: The sensex leapt over 500 points today after the market learnt that the economy could record 8 per cent growth this year  and attain 9 per cent in the next two to three years.        
	In a volatile day of trading, the bellwether index rose 539.11 points, or 3.2 per cent, on Wednesday to close at 17231.11 points, the highest level it has scaled in nearly two months.        
	The Christmas cheer was evident with across-the-board buying on Wednesday by Asia-based foreign institutional investors (FIIs), domestic institutions and mutual funds.         
	The global cues were strong, the finance ministers statement propped up sentiment and FIIs and domestic institutions went on a buying spree, said Sharekhan head of research Gaurav Dua. US and Asian markets were strong on Tuesday, and Europe opened in the green on Wednesday.        
	Another interesting development during the day was the performance of five stocks Reliance Industries, NTPC, Larsen amp; Toubro, Infosys and ICICI.         
	These five stocks were responsible for 50 per cent of the upmove. While there was some news on RIL and NTPC, ICICI, L amp;T and Infosys rose primarily because of shortcovering, said Motilal Oswals senior vice-president (research and strategy) Manish Sonthalia.         
	The market was enthused by Reliances new oil discovery in the KG-D3 basin. NTPC surged on talks that the government might allow it to sell up to 50 per cent of unallocated electricity in the open market.        
	The biggest gainers during the day were metal stocks where once again there was some short covering. Hindalco was the biggest gainer during the day on BSE that was up 7.77 per cent.

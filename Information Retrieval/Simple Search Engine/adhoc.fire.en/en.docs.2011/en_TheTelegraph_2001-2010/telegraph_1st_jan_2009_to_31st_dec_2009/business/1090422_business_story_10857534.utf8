The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Industry wants more
                                                                                                               Industry wants more
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, April 21: Industry today welcomed RBIs rate cuts but they fell short of its expectations.        
	A deeper cut in repo and reverse repo rates by at least 50 basis points would have been appropriate as the cost of credit is still high, said Chandrajit Banerjee, director-general of the CII.        
	Assocham president Sajjan Jindal also said the industry was expecting a 50-basis-point cut in the repo and reverse repo rates.         
	Assocham wants the RBI to be more aggressive in its policies.         
	Ficci president Harsh Pati Singhania said, The cut in the repo rate could have been steeper because of the strong cushion provided by the low inflation rate.         
	The PHD Chamber said higher interest rates, particularly by private banks, had made it difficult for businesses to borrow and invest.         
	On the governments behalf, economic affairs secretary Ashok Chawla said, This (rate cut) is another reiteration of the signal from the RBI to banks and the credit market. There is scope for softening of interest rates.         
	Industry was all praise for the relaxation of the policy on external commercial borrowings and buyback rules for foreign currency convertible bonds (FCCBs). The buyback limit on FCCBs has been enhanced to $100 million from $50 million.         
	In the current environment this would help companies with internal accruals, Ficcis Singhania said.         
	The cut in the reverse repo rate is aimed at increasing funds for commercial lending. However, the long end of the yield curve remains elevated because of the governments huge borrowing programme, Yashika Singh of Dun amp; Bradstreet India said.        
	Pradeep Jain, chairman of Parsvnath Developers, said, The onus now lies on the banks to facilitate consumer borrowing by lowering the prime lending rates.        
	Hemant Kanoria, Srei Infrastructure Finances chairman and managing director, said the cuts were a clear signal from the RBI to keep open future possibilities of rate cuts and easing the liquidity flow depending on how the economy fares in the coming months. Industry output had shrunk 1.2 per cent in February.

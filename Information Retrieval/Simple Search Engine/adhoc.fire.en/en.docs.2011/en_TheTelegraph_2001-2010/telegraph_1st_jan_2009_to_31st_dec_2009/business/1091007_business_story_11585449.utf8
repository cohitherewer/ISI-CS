	Calcutta, Oct. 6: Beam Global Spirits amp; Wines will launch its Makers Mark Bourbon whisky in India in early 2010.         
	The company, which owns popular whisky brands such as Jim Beam, DYC, Ardmore, Laphroaig and Teachers, has already started test-marketing Makers Mark in India.        
	There is a market for Makers Mark in India as the premium whisky segment is growing at a good rate here. We see a very good prospect for brands such as Makers Mark here, Harish Moolchandani, CEO amp; managing director (India amp; Indian sub continent), told The Telegraph today.        
	Makers Mark Bourbon was designed by Margie Samuels  wife of Makers Mark creator Bill Samuels Sr.  and the square-shaped container was inspired by her collection of cognac bottles.         
	Moolchandani said the company was also exploring possibilities to expand its Tequila portfolio in India. At present, Beam markets only the Sauza brand of Tequila in India.         
	We are planning to launch other variants in the Tequila segment during 2010 in India, Moolchandani said.        
	Beam Global  which launched several brands such as Jim Beam, DYC, Ardmore and Laphroaig in the last three years in India  plans to consolidate its Indian portfolio in 2009-10.         
	The company will focus on increasing the market presence of each of the brands, Moolchandani said.        
	Despite the downturn, the company has maintained its growth trajectory in the country; However, the momentum has reduced. Earlier, we achieved 20 to 25 per cent growth and this year it would be reduced to 13 to 14 per cent.        
	Meanwhile, the company has launched the Teachers Origin in India. The launch of Teachers Origin strengthens the Teachers Scotch whisky portfolio in India, which forms the core of Beam Globals market share in India, he said. Moolchandani said Beam Global expected its revenue to touch Rs 600 crore in the current year in India from Rs 450 crore last year. The Teachers brand accounts for over 80 per cent of the companys sales in India.

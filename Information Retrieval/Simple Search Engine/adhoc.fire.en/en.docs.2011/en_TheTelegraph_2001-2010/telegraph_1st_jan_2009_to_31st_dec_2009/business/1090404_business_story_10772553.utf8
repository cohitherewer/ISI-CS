The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Tatas to retain Singur land
                                                                                                               Tatas to retain Singur land
          SAMBIT SAHA                          Plot thickens                                  
	Calcutta, April 3: The Tatas will, in all likelihood, hang on to the Singur land.        
	The Bengal government has sent a notice to the car maker asking it to make its advance lease payment for the 645.67 acres at Singur. The lease rental became due on March 15.         
	The company has to pay Rs 1 crore to retain the plot till March 31 next year. Government sources said the company was yet to respond to the letter. The company has about three months to clear the dues.        
	Sources in the state administration said Tata Motors had expressed its willingness to pay up the money.        
	We are yet to hear from them. But they have informally told us that they will pay the rent, the official added.        
	On Wednesday, Tata Motors had said the company would discuss its plans for the leased plot with the Bengal government but did not give any further details.        
	At the commercial launch of the Nano in Mumbai on March 23, Ratan Tata had said the company had no plans to give up the land at Singur just yet. The factory sheds are still in place over there. We havent decided what to do with them, Tata had said.        
	Bengals industry secretary Sabyasachi Sen had told reporters in Singapore recently that the Nano could still roll out of Singur.        
	We have lost the chance of being the first production unit of Nano. It could still roll out of Singur later if local objections can be resolved through dialogue. Ultimately, Tata Motors may have to go in for more than one production centre in India. However, the decision rests with Tata Motors, Sen had said.        
	The Tatas plan to set up the mother plant for the Nano at Sanand in Gujarat, which is expected to be operational by early next year.        
	Bookings for the Nano open on April 9 and Tata Motors expects to receive heavy bookings. The raison detre for the Singur plant will be reinforced if the bookings cross a critical level.        
	Government sources said neither side had initiated talks on releasing the land.         
	Tata Motors has not said anything. And the state government has also not asked the company to return the land, sources added.        
	Bengal chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee told a news channel last week that he had sent a message to Ratan Tata that the people of Singur wanted him back.        
	The Tatas could set up an assembly line on the 647-acre plot and give up the rest of the land that was earmarked for vendors. Such a compromise cannot be ruled out and it could give the Trinamul the chance to back down.        
	Industry experts said the lease payment terms for the land were back loaded, which means that the carmaker needs to make only minimal payments in the early stages.        
	During the first five years of the 90-year lease, the Tatas will have to pay only Rs 1 crore a year. Under the terms of the agreement, it will only pay Rs 56.29 crore in the first 30 years, another Rs 199.51 crore in the next 30 years and Rs 600 crore in the final 30 years.        
	The Tata group has clung to the land that was allotted in other states when it couldnt set up projects because of local opposition. Tata Steel, for instance, has retained possession of about 3,000 acres at Gopalpur in Orissa for more than a decade.              
	 The Tatas had pulled out of Singur in September last year after a strident protest by the Trinamul Congress.              
	The Nano is currently being produced at its Pantnagar facility in Uttarakhand which has spare capacity to produce about 4,000 Nanos a month.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Sensex regains 12K peak
                                                                                                               Sensex regains 12K peak
          OUR BUREAU                                            
	Mumbai, May 4: The sensex vaulted above 12000 for the first time since last October buoyed by expectations that the longawaited industrial recovery could be round the corner.        
	The bellwether sensex spurted 731.50 points  the largest single-day gain this year  to 12134.75, a level that hasnt been seen since October 3. Late in the afternoon, the index had risen to a high of 12.161.90 before a bout of profit booking pared the gains.        
	The 6.41 per cent surge in the sensex means that the index is now ruling more than 50 per cent above the 2009 low in early March.        
	The hope of a recovery was ignited by a survey of 500 companies by ABN Amro that indicated Indias manufacturing sector had expanded for the first time in five months.        
	The ABN Amro Bank purchasing managers index rose to 53.3 in April from 49.5 in March. A figure above 50 indicates an expansion.        
	The report, which comes ahead of official statistics, dispelled gloom in the market which reopened for trading after a four-day break and had some catching up to do with overseas bourses that had turned buoyant. Investors have been speculating that the US governments plan to purchase $1 trillion worth of illiquid assets from banks will pull the global economy out of a recession.        
	Metals shine        
	Metals, information technology and banking stocks powered the rally that saw the other bellwether index  the Nifty  close 180.05 points higher at 3654.        
	Its a cyclical bull market now, said one expert as people struggled to hang a label on the latest rally. We are comfortably above the 200-day moving average.        
	The sensex vaulted over 500 points last week but, even at that stage, the experts had dubbed it as a bear market rally. The momentum is clearly on the side of the bulls now, said an analyst with Religare Securities.        
	Commodity stocks were buoyed by a CLSA report that showed Chinas manufacturing sector had also expanded for the first time in nine months. The CLSA China purchasing managers index rose to 50.1 in April from 44.8 in March. It is the first time since July that the number has risen above 50  a clear sign of expansion.        
	Sterlite rose 16.5 per cent to close at Rs 476.80, while aluminium producer Hindalco climbed 13.7 per cent to Rs 61.25. The metal index spurted 8.77 per cent to 7489.47.        
	Foreign funds are flush with liquidity and they are fuelling the rally, said Jayesh Shroff who manages SBI Mutual Fund.        
	Foreign funds had moved more than $1.4 billion into Indian shares in April, their biggest one-month purchase since October 2007.        
	RIL rose 4.58 per cent to Rs 1,885.35. The SBI rallied 6.9 per cent to Rs 1,366.20, while HDFC rose 13 per cent to Rs 1,957.60.

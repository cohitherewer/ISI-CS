                                                                                                                 Q amp;A      Exit route
                                I had invested Rs 12 lakh in a Senior Citizen Savings Scheme in April 2006 when the income tax benefit under Section 80C was not available for this scheme. If I want to close this account now, what amount will be deducted for the premature closure? Will the Rs 1 lakh out of the withdrawn amount be treated as income in the year of withdrawal under Section 80C (6A) as amended by the Finance Act, 2008?          S.K. Bagui, South 24-Parganas
                    Premature withdrawal or closure of an SCSS account is allowed after one year from the date of opening of the account but with a penal provision. If the account is closed after one year but before expiry of two years from the date of opening of the account, 1.5 per cent of the deposit amount shall be deducted. If the account is closed on or after the expiry of two years, 1 per cent of the deposit shall be deducted. While submitting income tax return, you will have to include the pre-TDS interest in your total annual income in the year of withdrawal and pay the remaining tax thereafter.                                  Senior query      I am a senior citizen. I have a three-year recurring deposit account with a public sector bank. The monthly instalment is Rs 2,000. At the end of three years, I shall get Rs 36,476. Will the entire amount be treated as taxable income or only the interest component?         Ranabir Sen, Calcutta
                    The tax liability will be on the accrued interest only and not on the principal amount. The bank will deduct tax at source at the rate of 10 per cent plus applicable surcharge. You will have to pay the remaining tax, if any, depending on your marginal income tax rate.                                  Stipend show      Research scholars pursuing Ph.D are getting a stipend of Rs 15,000 per month. Is such a stipend taxable? If not, under which section of the Income Tax Act is it tax-free?        T.K. Dutta, Calcutta
                    der Section 10 (16) of the Income Tax Act, scholarships granted to a person to meet education expenses are exempt from income tax.

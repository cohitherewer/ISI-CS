The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Stocks sizzle on strong global cues
                                                                                                               Stocks sizzle on strong global cues
  - Asian markets perk up on news of US rescue plan           OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                    
	Mumbai, March 23: The sensex reported its biggest single-day gain since December 10, 2008 as Barack Obamas $1-trillion booster dose for the US economy rejuvenated bourses worldwide.        
	In Asia, the sensex surged 457.34 points, or 5.10 per cent, Hong Kongs Hang Seng rose 4.78 per cent, Japans Nikkei 3.39 per cent, Singapores Straits Times Index more than 4 per cent and Koreas Kospi 2.44 per cent. Americas Dow Jones was up 3.80 per cent in early trading.        
	The US today announced the details of a plan to buy up to $1 trillion of toxic assets. Observers felt the move would help clean banks balance sheets thereby quickening the recovery of the economy.     
	Under the public-private- investment programme, troubled mortgages and securities, blamed for the current credit crisis, will be purchased. While some purchases will be done by the US governments Troubled Asset Relief Programme, low-interest loans will also be offered to private investors.         
	Shares on Wall Street jumped on the offer of financing for investors. With banks likely to be the beneficiaries of the plan, shares in Citigroup and Bank of America soared.        
	Last month, financial markets fell after the US administration offered only a bare outline of the proposed public-private-partnership programme.        
	This time the reaction was more positive. The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 was up 1.4 per cent, with financial stocks the major gainers.         
	Leading US indices opened rose more than two per cent in early trade. Shares in Citigroup soared more than 17 per cent, while Bank of America was up 15 per cent. Both are major holders of troubled assets covered by the plan.         
	The dollar fell broadly as the plan encouraged investors to move out of the perceived safety of the US currency. But it hit a session high against the euro after US treasury secretary Tim Geithner said the programme would provide a markets for illiquid securities.        
	On the BSE, the sensex opened higher at 9040.30 against Fridays close of 8966.68. It later peaked at 9454.69 and closed at 9424.02. Similarly, the National Stock Exchanges 50-share Nifty jumped 132.85 points, or 4.73 per cent, to close at 2939.90 from Fridays close of 2807.05.         
	Dealers said apart from local investors and institutions, foreign institutional investors (FIIs), who are now in a mood to buy, made brisk purchases. At close, the Instanex FII Index was up 5.21 per cent over Fridays close.         
	Banking, oil amp; gas and metal stocks led the rally. The BSE bankex, oil amp; gas index and metal index gained 6.66 per cent, 6.40 per cent and 6.31 per cent, respectively.         
	Reliance Industries, which has the highest weightage in the sensex, gained 7.56 per cent.         
	Bank stocks were in demand on expectations of good growth in lending on lower interest rates, while metal stocks surged on the back of a rally in their prices.         
	Other major gainers included Ranbaxy, which shot up nearly 11 per cent, Tata Steel (10.39 per cent), Hindalco (9.35 per cent), HDFC (8.44 per cent), ICICI Bank (7.36 per cent) and SBI (7.33 per cent).         
	Ranbaxy today said the health regulators in the UK and Australia had approved its manufacturing facility at Paonta Sahib in Himachal Pradesh.        
	Analysts are, however, cautious, It is a relief to see such a rally, but it remains to be seen whether it is sustainable. The economic slowdown continues and we also have the elections here. Therefore, one must be cautious, an analyst added.

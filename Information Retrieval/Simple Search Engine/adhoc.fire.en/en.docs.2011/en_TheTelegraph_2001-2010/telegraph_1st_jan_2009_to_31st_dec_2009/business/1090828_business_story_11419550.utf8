The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | RBI balancing skill put to tough test
                                                                                                               RBI balancing skill put to tough test
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                            
	Mumbai, Aug. 27: The Reserve Bank of India has said it has a tough balancing act to perform this year as it struggles to cope with the compulsion of spurring growth in the economy without fanning the flames of inflation.        
	In its annual report for 2008-09, which it released here today, the central bank said inflation was starting to rear its head again  and observers read the coded warning as a sign that it might have to tighten the monetary policy later this year. The RBI had opened the monetary taps last October to shovel cash into the financial system and reignite growth impulses in an economy that had started to flounder amid worldwide recession.        
	The RBI had aggressively cut key policy rates and pumped Rs 4,00,000 crore to revive growth in the economy.        
	However, in its first quarter review of monetary policy on June 28, the apex bank had refrained from changing any key rates even as it raised the inflation forecast for the end of this fiscal to 5 per cent from 4 per cent earlier.        
	The RBI said prices could rise because of a rebound in global commodity prices and the poor monsoon.        
	The deficient monsoon could affect the inflation outlook more than the growth prospects, the central bank said in the annual report.        
	Poor rains, it added, would not only put pressure on food prices but also increase the demand for more subsidies and relief measures.        
	The threat of higher inflation is not the only problem that the central bank will have to face for the rest of this year.         
	Listing the policy challenges, the RBI said a major near-term challenge would be to deal with the unpleasant combination of subdued growth with emerging risk of high inflation.        
	The RBI said if it withdrew its accommodative monetary policy stance, it could weaken economic recovery. Similarly, a continuation of the current policy with its added impact of high money supply growth could fuel inflation, thereby working against any recovery.        
	It said the timing and pace of exit from the current accommodative monetary policy stance would pose a major challenge. However, the most critical challenge for the economy is to revert to the high growth path which will be possible only with a faster recovery.

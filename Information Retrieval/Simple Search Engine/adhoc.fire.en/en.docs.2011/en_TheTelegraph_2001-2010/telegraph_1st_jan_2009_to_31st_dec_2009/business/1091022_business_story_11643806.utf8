	Oct. 21: Employees in India can expect an average salary hike of around 10 per cent next year  the highest in Asia.        
	According to a survey by Hewitt Associates, companies in Asia will be offering bigger pay rises next year as the region continues to rebound from global recession.        
	Salaries in Indonesia and China will surge 8.7 per cent and 6.7 per cent, respectively, whereas workers in Japan can expect a paltry 2.1 per cent pay rise.        
	The survey covered more than 2,000 local and joint-venture companies in the Asia-Pacific region.        
	Salary hikes this year in Asias fast-growing economic powerhouses  China and India  at 4.5 per cent and 6.3 per cent, respectively, were the lowest since 2005.        
	The pay barely grew in Hong Kong and Japan this year as companies cut staff.         
	More than 60 per cent of the companies surveyed in Hong Kong, Japan and Singapore froze wage levels compared with only 26.1 per cent in India and 30.8 per cent in China.        
	Next year, only 6 per cent of companies in India and 8.3 cent in China are expected to freeze pay compared with 12-14 per cent of companies in Japan, Singapore, Hong Kong and Australia.        
	The average annual salary increases between 2003 and 2008 in India were over 10 per cent.         
	In 2008, the average hike was 13.3 per cent.         
	Salaries rose the highest in 2007 by 15.1 per cent, Hewitt had said in February.

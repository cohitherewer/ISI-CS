The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Pre-poll fuel price cut hope fades
                                                                                                               Pre-poll fuel price cut hope fades
          R. SURYAMURTHY                          Crude spoiler                                  
	New Delhi, March 22: Rising crude price appears to have nixed the chances of a fuel price cut before the Lok Sabha polls.        
	Global crude prices have moved steadily from a low of $35 a barrel in January-February to over $51.        
	After the two rounds of price cuts in December and January, the government was again considering a reduction.         
	However, it needs to take the poll panels approval.        
	India imports about 80 per cent of its crude, meaning global trends influence local petrol and diesel prices.        
	Many within the Congress favoured another cut, but the petroleum and finance ministries were opposed to it.        
	Stand-in finance minister Pranab Mukherjee was against an additional burden on the oil companies.        
	The government is interested in another round of price cuts a few days before the poll date, but the rise in crude prices could force a rethink of the strategy as the petroleum and finance ministries dont want to put additional burden on the oil firms, sources said.        
	They said any further cut would increase the subsidy burden of the government, already facing a huge fiscal deficit.        
	As of now there is no plan to cut prices. We have not yet decided on this, petroleum minister Murli Deora said.         
	With the increase in crude prices, oil companies are losing six paise on every litre of petrol. They continue to make a profit of Rs 5.50 per litre of diesel.        
	Sources said the government could go in for a small cut in diesel prices if it got a clearance from the Election Commission as a populist measure before the polls.        
	Oil PSUs incur a loss of Rs 129.57 per domestic LPG cylinder and Rs 9.19 a litre on kerosene. The total subsidy on petrol, diesel, kerosene and cooking gas is estimated at a little over Rs 100,000 crore for 2008-09.

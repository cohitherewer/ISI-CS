The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Board shoots down bogus staff charge
                                                                                                               Board shoots down bogus staff charge
  - Three shortlisted for top job
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Das: Busy schedule                                  
	Hyderabad, Jan. 23: The Satyam board today questioned the claims of inflated employee numbers, while finalising three candidates each for the post of the CEO and CFO. The board will meet again on Monday and Tuesday.        
	At the end of its two-day deliberations, the board denied that disgraced former chairman B. Ramalinga Raju had inflated the employee rolls to siphon off funds.        
	A company spokesperson said prima facie there appeared to be no basis for doubting that Satyam had 53,000 employees. The Andhra Pradesh CID had yesterday alleged that Satyam had bogus employees on its rolls.         
	An independent investigation in the coming weeks will reveal the actual number of staff, the spokesperson added.        
	Tarun Das, the chief mentor of the CII, chaired the meetings of the six-member board, all hand-picked by the government to clear the mess created by Raju when he confessed to a massive Rs 7,000-crore fraud.         
	It has submitted the names of the six candidates for the posts of CEO and CFO to the Prime Ministers Office and the ministry of corporate affairs. In the fray is Venkatesh Roddam, the former head of Nipuna, the outsourcing arm of Satyam.         
	The board expects that by January 28 it will be able to ensure funds to pay salaries and the suppliers at least till March. It has endorsed that the immovable properties of the company are free of any encumbrance.         
	The Andhra Pradesh government, however, has frozen the assets of 249 benami companies promoted by the Raju family.         
	A Hyderabad court today dismissed the petition of Sebi and the Serious Frauds Investigation Office to quiz Raju.        
	In another hearing, the Supreme Court today refused to give any direction to Sebi and the BSE to cancel transactions in the shares of Satyam.

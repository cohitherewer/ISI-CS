The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Kuwaits Zain eyes telecom stake 
                                                                                                               Kuwaits Zain eyes telecom stake 
          PIYA SINGH                                            
	Mumbai, March 29: The $7.4-billion Kuwait-based Zain Group, which aspires to become one of the worlds 10 leading mobile operators by 2011, is eyeing a stake in one of the smaller telecom entities.        
	Zain had initiated talks with the Essar groups Loop Telecom last year.        
	It is still open to discussions with Loop Telecom, which won a new telecom licence last year to provide services in 23 circles across the country, according to a news report on the Zain website. Loop Telecom (formerly BPL Mobile) provides telecom services in Mumbai.        
	The Kuwait-based telecom company, which manages over 63 million customers across West Asia and Africa, may also approach Datacom, which received a pan-Indian licence last year.         
	Datacom is jointly promoted by the Dhoots of Videocon group and the Nahatas of Himachal Futuristic.         
	Videocon group chairman Venugopal Dhoot told The Telegraph, We have not spoken to them yet. However, I do not rule out any possibility in the future.         
	Loop Telecoms Vikas Saraf, who is responsible for the Essar groups telecom ventures, offered a similar response. Last year, we did have some discussions with Zain. However, at this point we are not talking to them. Its difficult to say who we will be talking to in the coming months.         
	Loop and Datacom are two pan-Indian GSM telecom licence holders that have not yet tied up with any global major to finance their pan-Indian rollouts.         
	Both companies have spoken to several global telecom companies in the past year.         
	Both Datacom and Loop Telecom have to sort out some problems at home before they can initiate serious discussions with a global telecom player for a stake sale.        
	For instance, the Dhoots of Videocon  the consumer goods company which holds a 64 per cent stake in Datacom  have been engaged in a tussle with the Nahatas of Himachal Futuristic.         
	Essar groups Loop Telecom has been engaged in a tussle with Vodafone in which the Ruias have a 33 per cent stake. The joint venture agreement between the London headquartered Vodafone and the Ruias of Essar provides for a non-compete agreement. The move to take Loop Telecom national is causing a great deal of friction between the partners in Vodafone India.        
	Industry sources said these differences had been simmering for several months and were proving to be the biggest roadblock to any deal with a global player.         
	The most critical element in any deal is the value of the transaction.         
	Both the Dhoots and the Ruias will be looking to drive a hard bargain when they negotiate with Zain or any other global telecom player.        
	Last year, there were two big telecom deals. First, the Tata group succeeded in getting an attractive price from Japans NTT DoCoMo, which acquired a 26 per cent stake in Tata Teleservices for $2.7 billion. Second, Telenor of Norway acquired around 67 per cent in Unitech Wireless for $1.2 billion.         
	The two deals are not comparable since Tata Teleservices provides telecom operations in several circles, while Unitech Wireless is a newbie.

          SAMBIT SAHA                              
	Calcutta, Nov. 8: An agreement over payments for electricity between Dunlop and the Bengal power department has paved the way for the reopening of the companys Sahagunj plant, raising the hopes of around 900 benched workers.        
	The Pawan Ruia management has agreed to provide a bank guarantee to West Bengal State Electricity Distribution Company Ltd (WBSEDCL) which has promised to resume supply.        
	Dunlop had lifted the suspension of work at the Bengal unit on March 6, but issues concerning electricity arrears and the mode of payment for ongoing consumptions had held up production.        
	The tyre makers other plant at Ambattur in Chennai went on stream last month.        
	In March, the management had called around 250 employees for refurbishment work at Sahagunj. The fate of the rest of the workers hung in balance. The workers continued to be on the rolls of the company but couldnt join work till production started.        
	I have decided to submit a bank guarantee of Rs 1.6 crore next week, preferably Monday itself, Pawan K. Ruia, chairman of Dunlop, told The Telegraph.        
	Earlier, the company wanted to give a letter of credit (LoC) of Rs 53.77 lakh to WBSEDCL.         
	However, differences over the terms of the LoC had led to a deadlock. An LoC is a banking instrument that ensures a supplier gets paid for the service, or goods, it provides directly from the bank, if the buyer defaults.        
	Dunlop charged WBSEDCL on going back on its commitment vis-a-vis the letter of credit. The power utility said that it wanted a financial instrument that conformed to norms prescribed by the State Electricity Regulatory Commission.        
	Dunlop sources said the bank guarantee, which was being offered instead of the LoC, had been approved by the power department on Friday.        
	The management is confident of commencing operations within weeks of getting electricity, which can even be tomorrow.         
	Ruia said Sahagunj would start producing off-the-road tyres, truck tyres, belts and hoses.        
	The development comes at a time when Ruia got a lot of flak from Trinamul Congress chief Mamata Banerjee at a public forum for not being able to open Sahagunj. Ruia had met Mamata last year to end the Dunlop impasse. A suspension order was imposed shortly thereafter, with the management citing non-co-operation from the workers unions.        
	The Left Front government, especially industry minister Nirupam Sen, had to step in to resolve the deadlock.        
	The issue of clearing past dues of around Rs 12 crore was settled in September at Sens initiative. Dunlop withdrew a legal case against the power department and reached an out-of-court settlement.         
	Dunlop had run up the huge electricity bill when the plant remained closed under the erstwhile Chhabria management.        
	Even after power supply was resumed, the two parties were locked in a fresh quarrel over the LoC terms.         
	During this period, Dunlop won a legal case in Tamil Nadu over electricity that led to the resumption of work at Ambattur.         
	Ruia acquired Dunlop and Falcon in December 2005 from the Chhabria family.

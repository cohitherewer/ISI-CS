	New Delhi, March 17: India may achieve its foreign direct investment target of $35 billion for this fiscal, following the sharp upswing in January inflows.        
	The remaining two months are expected to be good, sources said.        
	Besides, analysts said, the policy changes of last month may help in reaching the target.        
	FDI in January rose to $2.74 billion from $1.4 billion in the previous month. In January 2007, FDI was $1.77 billion.        
	FDI inflows between April and January grew 65 per cent to $23.9 billion.         
	 It is an indication that the long-term policy outlook on the economy is very positive. The FIIs had taken out money with a short-term outlook. The growth in FDI is because of the strong fundamentals of the economy and the stimulus measures taken by the country, said N.R. Bhanumurthy of the Institute of Economic Growth.        
	The January growth came after a 25 per cent year-on-year decline in foreign investments in the October-December quarter. In the April-September period, FDI was up 137 per cent from a year earlier at $17.2 billion.

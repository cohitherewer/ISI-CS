                                                                                                               Jet fuel price falls further
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Dec. 31: State-owned oil companies today cut jet fuel prices by 6.8 per cent, the eighth reduction since September.        
	The jet fuel price in Delhi is down to Rs 30,457.21 per kilolitre (kl). It is Rs 31,378.78 per kl in Mumbai. In Calcutta, the price is down to Rs 38,469.34 per kl and in Chennai, it is Rs 34,007.20 per kl.        
	In August, prices soared to Rs 70,000 per kl, only to cool down as crude prices beat a retreat.         
	Crudes tumble may prompt the government to further cut petrol and diesel prices. Petroleum ministry officials said they had discussed the move with oil marketing companies and exploration firms.        
	Sources said the government was weighing some combination of price and excise duty cuts for petrol, diesel and LPG cylinders.        
	The government is believed to be considering a cut of Rs 5 on a litre of petrol, Rs 3 on a litre of diesel and Rs 20 on a domestic LPG cylinder.         
	It collects an excise duty of Rs 13.35 per litre on unbranded petrol and Rs 3.65 per litre on unbranded diesel.        
	The government had cut petrol and diesel prices in early December.         
	After the cuts, the state-owned oil marketing companies are making a profit of Rs 11.99 per litre on petrol and Rs 4.13 per litre on diesel. They continue to lose Rs 12.16 on the sale of every litre of kerosene and Rs 132.97 on each domestic LPG cylinder.        
	The oil companies  Indian Oil Corporation, Bharat Petroleum Corporation Ltd and Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Ltd  are making a profit as the price of the Indian basket of crude is currently ruling around $38 a barrel.

          SAMBIT SAHA                          Hard times                                  
	Calcutta, July 12: The fire that engulfed part of the mother plant of Haldia Petrochemicals on July 2 may cripple operations at Bengals showcase project for the rest of the year.        
	The plant is likely to run at 70 per cent of its capacity because of the accident, denting the companys profitability this fiscal.         
	After five consecutive years of profit, HPL suffered a loss last fiscal, affected by a duty on naphtha and the global financial turmoil.        
	The market for polymer  the primary product of HPL  has revived from its lows, but the company will have to struggle to make money as it will not be able to produce enough to cater to the demand.         
	Moreover, the company will shut down after the monsoons to ramp up production by 30 per cent under the much-delayed Project Supermax. This will also affect HPLs finances.        
	The fire has destroyed one of the boilers within the naphtha cracker complex and caused collateral damage.        
	The plant is now running without the damaged boiler, but will be able to function at full capacity only after the boiler is changed.         
	These are specialised items which not available off the shelf. A replacement is likely to take 6-7 months, a source from the plant said.        
	When contacted by The Telegraph, HPL officials did not want to divulge details.        
	A detailed study is being carried out. It (time required to change damaged parts) will be evident after the study is completed, the company responded to a written questionnaire.         
	HPL said production had resumed but did not specify the capacity being utilised. Production is being stabilised. Hence, no fixed number can be shared, it said.        
	It also did not divulge the magnitude of loss because of the damage to the plant and machinery.         
	However, sources said it could top Rs 100 crore. But the more worrying aspect of the fire is the loss in productivity.         
	While the state government-backed HPL management wants to portray it as a freak accident, serious doubts are being raised at the way the plant is being run.        
	Many experienced workers have left the company in the last few years, leaving key operations in the hands of relatively inexperienced people. Three people had died on May 24 while cleaning a gas chamber.         
	The management is yet to ascertain the exact nature of the accident that took place on May 24.        
	Insiders say the fire at naphtha cracker could be an operational mistake.        
	Purnendu Chatterjee, chairman of The Chatterjee Group and a promoter of HPL, had written to the company about the operational dangers the plant faced.

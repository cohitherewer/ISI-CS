                                                                                                               Simpler car import rules
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                          In queue                                  
	New Delhi, Dec. 31: Foreign car companies can export to India from any country and not solely from their home base.        
	A government notification today, thus, allows a company, such as Toyota, to bring cars not only from Japan but also from other nations where it has factories.        
	However, the relaxation will only apply to vehicles with a minimum free on board value of $40,000 (Rs 19 lakh plus) and petrol engine capacity of more than 3,000cc or diesel engine capacity of more than 2,500cc.         
	Those to benefit include Japans Honda and Toyota, and Germanys Mercedez Benz, BMW, Audi and Porsche.         
	Officials said the rule was changed as the India-Thailand free trade pact allows all car makers in that country to export here.         
	According to auto analyst Murad Baig, It means a car importer can make a little extra money. Say a high-end Honda manufactured in Thailand costs a little less than it costs when made in Japan. The car when sold in India will probably be sold at the same price but will give a better profit.         
	He said the impact might not be perceptible among buyers as for cars which cost Rs 50 lakh, a few thousand rupees discount does not make sense to customers.        
	It was only logical for the government to make such an amendment. The objective is to give a level-playing field to all car manufacturers, Ajay Sahai, director- general, Federation of Indian Export Organisations, told The Telegraph.        
	However, the imports will only be from some ports in Mumbai, Calcutta, Chennai, Kochi and Inland Container Depot, Tuglaqabad.         
	The container depot is near Delhi from where cargo is sent to ports.

                                                                                                               Gaps seen in R-Com books
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Oct. 12: Anil Ambanis Reliance Communications (R-Com) is alleged to have inflated revenues by Rs 2,915 crore for 2007-08 and evaded payment of Rs 315 crore in licence fee.        
	According to a report by Jaipur-based auditor Parekh amp; Co, actual revenue earned by R-Com was only Rs 12,298 crore against Rs 15,213 crore reported to shareholders. Parekh amp; Co was appointed by the department of telecom (DoT) to do a special audit of R-Coms accounts.        
	There seems to be an over reporting of Rs 2,915 crore in revenues for 2007-08. It also found that R-Com evaded licence and spectrum fees worth Rs 315 crore, sources quoted the report as saying.        
	A four-member committee of the DoT will examine the report, which was submitted after the auditors were given a three-month extension. If the violations are confirmed, the operator will be subjected to penalties.        
	An R-Com spokesperson said the company was in full compliance with licence terms and conditions. All revenues for 2007-08 are correctly reported. Alleged comments of special auditor do not reflect any under-reporting of revenue or licence fees, he said.

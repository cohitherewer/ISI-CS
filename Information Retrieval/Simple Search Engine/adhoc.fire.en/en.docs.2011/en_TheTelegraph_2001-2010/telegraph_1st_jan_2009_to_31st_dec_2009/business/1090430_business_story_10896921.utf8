                                                                                                               ArcelorMittal suffers loss
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Melting point                                  
	Calcutta, April 29: ArcelorMittal, the worlds largest steel maker, has suffered a higher- than-expected loss of $1.1 billion in the first quarter ended March 31, 2009, impacted by the wilting demand for the alloy.        
	The Luxembourg-headquartered company had posted a profit of $2.37 billion in the year-ago period. The quarterly loss has been attributed to inventory write-downs.        
	During the January-March period the companys sales almost halved to $15.1 billion from $29.1 billion a year ago.        
	The company will continue with a 45 per cent production cut in the wake of the World Steel Associations prediction of a 15 per cent decline in global steel demand, the sharpest drop since 1945.        
	Lakshmi Mittal, CEO and chairman of ArcelorMittal, said, Although market conditions remain challenging, a technical recovery is inevitable and ArcelorMittal will benefit from this.        
	The steel maker expects earnings before interest, depreciation tax and amortisation in the second quarter to benefit from a hike in steel prices and rise to $1.2-1.5 billion from $883 million in the first quarter.         
	India plans        
	ArcelorMittals plan to set up two 12-million-tonne plants at an investment of around $20 billion is on track.         
	However, the current economic situation could force the company to begin with a 3mt plant against 6mt considered earlier.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      Happy shopping                          
	Calcutta, Dec. 11: Bengal Shristi  a joint venture between the Srei group and the Asansol-Durgapur Development Authority  has selected Big Bazaar as the anchor retailer for its upcoming mall in Asansol, managing director Sujit Kanoria said.        
	Asansol Centrum is the mall at the heart of the 90-acre township project that Bengal Shristi is developing.        
	We hope to open the mall by Poila Baisakh (Bengali new year), he said.        
	The township has 20 acres for shopping, office, IT, hotel and a club that comprise the central business district.         
	Bengal Shristi is going slow on IT, which constitutes more than half of the central business district, because of the economic downturn.         
	The IT space will be developed in over 1 million square feet of area. The mall is being built on a 2.5 lakh-square-foot space. The company is looking at tie-ups with established hotel chains for its business hotel.        
	Bengal Shristi has completed one-third of the residential part of the township, called Shantinagar, and has delivered 400 flats. It has also built a hotel-cum-wellness centre in Shantiniketan. The centre will be open for reservation in six months.                     
	The centre would be open to reservation within next 6 month.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Festive highs and lows
                                                                                                               Festive highs and lows
        Get your arithmetic right before deciding on any home loan offer, says Srikumar Bondyopadhyay                                        
	Come festive season and consumers are spoilt for choice with attractive home loan offers.        
	Banks are now offering special lending rates as low as 7.95 per cent on fresh home loans, which were ruling at around 11-12 per cent a few months ago.         
	In 2003, ABN Amro had kick started a rate war with its Super Saver Loan Package offer of 6 per cent interest in the first year and 6.5 per cent rate in the second year. The offer came at a time when big names such as the State Bank of India, ICICI Bank and Punjab National Bank were offering home loans at 7.75 per cent floating rate.        
	Home loan borrowers who signed in for ABN Amros Super Saver offer found themselves in a tight spot after the first two years.         
	From 2005, interest rates started moving northwards. For ABN Amro borrowers, the interest rate on their home loans became floating and linked to the banks retail prime lending rate.         
	Read the fine print        
	Cheap is always not good economics. On the face of it, discounts may be attractive. But you must read the fine print to get yourself prepared for the undeclared costs.        
	Let us explain this with the help of current offers.        
	The State Bank of India, the countrys largest lender, is now offering an interest rate of 8 per cent. The banks ongoing My Home campaign, valid till November 7 this year, offers an 8 per cent interest rate in the first year and 8.5 per cent for the second and third year. From the fourth year, it will be a floating rate kept at 2.75 percentage points below the banks advance reference rate (SBAR).         
	If the banks current SBAR at 11.75 per cent remains unchanged, the floating interest rate from the fourth year will be 9 per cent.        
	Compare this with the interest rate offered by ICICI Bank, the countrys largest private sector lender. The bank is giving fresh loans at a floating rate of 8.75 per cent, or 4 percentage points below its retail finance reference rate of 12.75 per cent.        
	If the banks benchmark lending rates remain unchanged, an ICICI Bank borrower who has taken a Rs 10-lakh loan for 15 years will have to pay Rs 17,990,07, that is an interest amount of Rs 7,990,07.         
	Another borrower who has taken the same Rs 10-lakh home loan for 15 years under SBIs My Home offer will have to pay Rs 18,021,60, an interest of Rs 8,021,60.         
	So, though the SBI offer looks more attractive than the ICICI Bank scheme, it is actually the opposite.         
	Appearance can be deceptive and unless you know the tricky calculations, you may end up signing a costly loan.         
	Teaser tale        
	The festival discounts on interest rates are termed as teaser rates  a borrower can be in for a big surprise when the discount validity gets over and the offered rate is realigned to the lenders card rate.         
	Let us assume that after the expiry of the discount, the lenders retail lending benchmark rate stands one percentage point higher than at the time of signing the loan.         
	So, when it is time for realigning the offered interest rate, the borrower may suddenly see the interest rate going up by a few hundred basis points (100 basis points = 1 percentage point).         
	This results in an increase in EMI of Rs 535 per Rs 10-lakh loan for 10 years, Rs 586 for a 15-year loan and Rs 633 for a 20-year loan.        
	Switch-over logic        
	These special offers, however, could provide a good opportunity for existing home loan borrowers to shift their loans taken at a high cost to a low-cost one.         
	Banks and housing finance companies offer these teaser rates during the festival season to attract new borrowers and do not extend the benefit of lower rates to existing customers.         
	If you have a good track record of paying your EMIs regularly, you can approach some other lender offering a lower rate.         
	Even some public sector banks are now eager for such loan takeovers.        
	Uco Bank has launched a Uco Comfort Home Loan scheme to draw existing borrowers of other banks.         
	The SBI also has many borrowers who had earlier taken loans at a high cost from private sector banks.         
	As an existing home loan borrower, you should remember that your current lender may charge you a penalty equivalent to 2 per cent of the outstanding loan for the premature closure.         
	There may not be any penalty if you repay the entire loan before schedule. But a penalty will be imposed if you want to transfer the balance loan to some other lender.         
	Since you may have to pay a 2 per cent penalty, the balance transfer wont be economical unless the difference in the interest rate offered by the new lender is at least 2 percentage points less than what you are paying now.        
	Is it necessary?        
	The most crucial aspect of taking a home loan is whether it really makes sense for you. Finances may be cheap, but is the property price worth a buy? The National Housing Bank index on prices of residential properties across cities shows that last year realty prices in some cities have increased steeply (see chart). In Calcutta, a property that would have cost you Rs 10 lakh in 2007 will cost more than Rs 14 lakh now. Will you buy the property and get it financed at 8.5 per cent interest rate or stay at a rented place?        
	A home loan of Rs 10 lakh at 8.5 per cent will cost you an interest of Rs 4,55,960 over a period of 10 years, or a monthly interest payment of Rs 3,800. If with a monthly rental of Rs 3,800, you can get the same space or more than what you intended to buy, why should you take a home loan?         
	This festive season take a break from your home loan worries. Dont get carried away by the goodies on offer; enjoy the celebrations while you take time to place your bet with the best.

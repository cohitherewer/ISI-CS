          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Mumbai, Jan. 14: The Investors Grievances Forum (IGF) today filed a public interest litigation in Bombay High Court relating to the fraud committed at Satyam Computer Services.        
	In its petition, IGF said the court should appoint a panel that would suggest measures to make regulatory processes more effective till the Union government came up with an appropriate law. It also submitted that regulators and the auditors should be held responsible for the accounting fudge that sent the stock skidding and that they should be compelled to make good the loss to small investors.        
	The court adjourned the matter till January 22. IGF president Kirit Somaiya said the counsel for the forum argued that the case required immediate attention.         
	Somaiya said the petitioners had been allowed to serve notices on the respondents, which include the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India, Price Waterhouse, the two stock exchanges, Sebi, besides Satyam promoters and former directors.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Biyani vows flotation in Future
                                                                                                               Biyani vows flotation in Future
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                          Biyani: Cash pursuit                                  
	New Delhi, Sept. 15: Kishore Biyani-owned Future Group will hit the market by March next year with an initial public offer for its investment arm Future Ventures.        
	However, the amount sought to be raised would be much lower than the previously planned Rs 1,000 crore.        
	Future Group CEO Kishore Biyani said the group was reviving the draft red herring prospectus (DRHP) after the previous one expired on September 3 this year.         
	Yes, that is already on the cards (around Diwali), he said of the prospectus.        
	Biyani, however, did not disclose the percentage of promoter holding to be diluted or the amount to be raised through the IPO.         
	On whether the listing of Future Ventures could materialise before the end of the fiscal, he said, Yes, that is a possibility. But we can look at some other possibilities also.        
	He did not elaborate on the other options.        
	Future Ventures had received market regulator Sebis approval for an IPO on September 4 last year.         
	According to the regulations, a company has to hit the capital markets within 12 months of receiving approval.         
	Last year, Future Ventures had said it was looking to raise up to Rs 1,000 crore to fund expansion plans.        
	Future Group, which is into various businesses besides retail, is looking at ways to raise funds.        
	In June, group firm Pantaloon Retail said it would raise Rs 1,000 crore through a securities issue to institutional investors.        
	Besides, the group is selling its non-core businesses such as technology, brands and logistics to raise about Rs 1,000 crore.        
	This is part of the groups plan to invest Rs 3,000-4,000 crore over the next three to four years to add another 18 million square feet of retail space over the 12 million sq ft in use.        
	Biyanis aim is to create a conglomerate with a turnover of Rs 25,000 crore.

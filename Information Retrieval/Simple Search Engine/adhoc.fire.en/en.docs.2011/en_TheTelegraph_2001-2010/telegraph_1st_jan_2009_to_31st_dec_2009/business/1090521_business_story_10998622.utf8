          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Bridge the gap                                   
	Calcutta, May 20: The Bengal government is looking at hydel power projects in Bhutan. At present, only 3 per cent of the total power generated in the state came from hydroelectricity and the rest from thermal sources, primarily coal.        
	We have approached the central government to allow us to execute hydel power projects in Bhutan, said Sunil Mitra, additional chief secretary at the department of power in Bengal. Mitra was addressing an interactive session organised by the Merchants Chamber of Commerce today.         
	According to Mitra, West Bengal State Electricity Distribution Company Ltd (WESEDCL) will be the nodal agency for the projects in Bhutan.         
	We are aiming for a project with a capacity of 600MW in Bhutan. We have already identified three to four river sites there, said Mitra, who is also the government nominee on the board of the states power distribution company.        
	Bengal offers a limited scope for developing hydroelectricity projects. Though there are many rivers, most lack the force to be able to generate power. Reservoirs, too, are not viable as it will be difficult to rehabilitate the displaced, Mitra said.        
	In the Eleventh Plan period (2007-2012), the state plans to add 3,262MW. Of this, 2,260MW has already been added. The target is 2470MW by this calendar year. At the end of March 2007, the states total generation capacity was 4,196MW.         
	The capacity addition in the first three years of the Eleventh Plan is almost 59 per cent. Over the next three years, another 792MW will be added, Mitra said.

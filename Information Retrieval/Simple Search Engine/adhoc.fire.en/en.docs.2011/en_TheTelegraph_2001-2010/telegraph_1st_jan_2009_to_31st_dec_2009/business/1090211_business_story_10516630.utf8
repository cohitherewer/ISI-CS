          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Feb. 10: The central government prefers to go slow on the selloff process in Satyam Computer. It is also considering a proposal of Andhra Pradesh chief minister Y. S. R. Reddy to hand over the Satyam case to the CBI.        
	The committee of secretaries, which took stock of the Satyam situation today, is believed to have taken note of the chief ministers letter to Prime Minister Manmohan Singh.         
	Reddy wrote that it would be appropriate if the CBI takes over the investigation so that co-ordination with various agencies, including overseas, can be better achieved.         
	However, officials said more formalities would be required from the state government before the case could be handed over to the CBI.        
	Top officials said the government was not keen on any early sale of Satyam as this would be detrimental to the share value and the larger interests of the firm. The first task is to stabilise Satyam and then bring on board a long-term investor.        
	Satyam founder B. Ramalinga Raju, his brother Rama Raju and CFO Srinivas Vadlamani today filed a fresh petition for bail in Hyderabad. The company plunged into turmoil last month following the confessions of a massive fraud by Ramalinga Raju.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Pawar: Future plans                                  
	New Delhi, Nov. 21: India, the worlds second biggest rice grower, plans to sell the grain in local markets from reserves to douse fears of shortage caused by the worst monsoon in three decades, farm minister Sharad Pawar said on Saturday.        
	We will offload rice and wheat in the open market. The process may start in the next 10 days, he said.        
	The minister ruled out any plans to import rice from Thailand and Vietnam amid a positive response to the government-sponsored procurement programme in northern states.        
	Indias worst monsoon in 37 years is expected to reduce this years output of summer-sown rice by about 15 million tonnes.        
	We are not very eager to import rice as the procurement scenario has improved recently, Pawar said.        
	The government will sell 15 lakh tonnes of wheat and five lakh tonnes of rice in the open market to increase availability and cool down prices.         
	While the price of rice has gone up by about 25 per cent in the last five months, wheat prices have shot up by about 20 per cent since September.        
	The minister said procurement is higher in Haryana and Punjab than last year. He said the Uttar Pradesh government had assured that the state would contribute well to the central pool.         
	In UP, the price of rice has come down below the MSP and there has been demand from farmers that we should start procurement, Pawar said.        
	Fearing a supply shortfall, the government had asked state-owned firms to float rice import tenders last month to buy 30,000 tonnes of rice, but may not buy as the price quoted were too high.

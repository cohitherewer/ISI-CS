The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Tariff treat for phone users
                                                                                                               Tariff treat for phone users
          OUR BUREAU AGENCIES                          R-Com president Mahesh Prasad (right) with chief marketing officer N. Mukherjee in Mumbai on Monday. (PTI)                                  
	Oct. 5: Subscribers may soon have an attractive spread of telecom tariffs to choose from.         
	The telecom regulator has proposed to give customers the option of paying tariff based on per-second use instead of the current per-minute pulse.        
	We may ask all operators to consider per-second pulse as a mandatory tariff option along with their other tariff plans, Trai chairman J.S. Sarma told reporters on the sidelines of the International Telecommunication Union conference in Geneva.        
	Back home, Anil Ambanis Reliance Communications (R-Com) today cut call rates to 50 paise per minute across all networks. R-Com is the latest operator to enter the tariff war after Tata DoCoMo announced a per-second billing model for GSM users.         
	R-Com is offering the 50-paise-per-minute Simply Reliance plan on its CDMA and GSM networks to all pre-paid and post-paid users for local, STD and roaming calls. Though the tariff of 50 paise per minute is not new, it is for the first time that an operator is offering it for calls made to other networks as well.         
	Analysts say the R-Com scheme has been announced to take on Tata DoCoMo. The move also comes ahead of mobile number portability being implemented in a couple of months.        
	From tomorrow, every Indian consumer can enjoy up to 46 per cent saving in their monthly bill. It is available to any category, any technology across India. Every consumer, be it rural or urban, can afford it, Nilanjan Mukherjee, chief marketing officer of R-Com, said in Mumbai.        
	Last week, BSNL introduced one paise per second pulse (for local calls) and two paise per second pulse (for STD) in Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh and Orissa. Aircel, too, extended its pay-per-second calling plan from Calcutta and Orissa to Uttar Pradesh last week.         
	Taking a cue from the latest trends, Trai may soon seek suggestions from operators on making the per-second billing model mandatory.

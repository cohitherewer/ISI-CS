                                                                                                               Birla BPO unit aims big
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Calcutta, Sept. 16: Aditya Birla Minacs, the BPO arm of the AV Birla group, is targeting a two-fold jump in turnover at $1 billion by 2013 with its three-tier strategy. It also plans to focus on the non-voice BPO business.        
	We plan to increase engagements with other Aditya Birla group companies, besides growing organically. We are also looking for potential acquisitions in the non-voice BPO business, Deepak Patel, CEO of Aditya Birla Minacs, said today on the sidelines of a programme organised by Nasscom here.        
	Aditya Birla Minacs, which reported a business of Rs 1,750 crore last year, intends to achieve a 50:50 mix of voice and non-voice revenues.        
	Patel said the company would concentrate on the geographies it operates in. Possible takeovers are likely to happen in those geographies only, he said.         
	The company has a team of advisers for mergers and acquisitions.        
	The company is looking to build capabilities in Asian and Hispanic languages to support large clients and is exploring options to set up delivery centres in Latin America, western Europe and the Philippines, besides smaller cities in India.        
	The BPO unit serves Aditya Birla group companies in sectors such as telecom and insurance.         
	It is now eyeing business outside the group, mainly in telecommunications and financial services.

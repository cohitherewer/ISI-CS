	New Delhi, March 28: The economy needs more stimulus in the next fiscal to counter the slowdown, Planning Commission deputy chairman Montek Singh Ahluwalia said today. We need a little more stimulus in 2009-10. But there are certain issues which have to be taken up, he said on the sidelines of a meeting with industry leaders.        
	On market borrowings impacting interest rates, Ahluwalia said, If you borrow, it can only raise the interest rate for any given level of monetisation. There has always been market borrowings and there will always be market borrowings.

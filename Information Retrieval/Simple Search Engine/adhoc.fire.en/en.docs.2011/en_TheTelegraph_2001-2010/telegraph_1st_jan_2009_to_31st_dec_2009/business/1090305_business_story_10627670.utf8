                              Tendulkar: Critical                            
	New Delhi, March 4 (PTI): RBI rate cuts are no answer to growth woes as banks are already flush with funds, according to Suresh Tendulkar, the chairman of the Economic Advisory Council to the Prime Minister.        
	Banks are flush with liquidity. In this kind of situation, reducing the rate by the RBI wont help much, he said.         
	An indicator is banks holding government securities up to 31 per cent of their deposits against 24 per cent mandated by the Reserve Bank.        
	Since mid-September, the RBI has gradually reduced key policy ratios to improve the health of the economy, while the government is periodically injecting stimulants.        
	However, growth in the third quarter, announced last week, was a disappointing 5.3 per cent, raising manifold the chances of failing to meet the 7.1 per cent growth target for the year.        
	Tendulkar was expecting some rebound in industry growth in January. Steel, coal seem to be optimistic. There will be some improvement, he said.        
	Industrial production had contracted for the second time in the current financial year in December by 2 per cent.

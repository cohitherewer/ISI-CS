          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      Globus Spirits CFO Bhaskar Roy in Calcutta on Friday. (PTI)                          
	Calcutta, Aug. 28: Delhi-based Globus Spirits Ltd, which will come out with its initial public offering of 75 lakh equity shares on August 31, will set up a bottling plant at Dankuni, according to a senior official of the company.         
	The company doesnt have any distillery or bottling unit in Bengal.        
	We are looking for land at Dankuni where our first bottling plant in the state will come up, said Bhaskar Roy, executive vice-president and chief financial officer of Globus Spirits. The plant will have an initial capacity of around 25,000 cases a month, which will be increased to 1 lakh cases a month, he said.        
	Initially, the plant will cater to IFB  a potable alcohol manufacturer in the state. The plant will start bottling our own Indian-made foreign liquor (IMFL) brands when they are established here, Roy said. Globus has got into IMFL manufacturing only a year and a half ago with its portfolio comprising 20-20 Premium and Samurai Gold Extra Rich Whisky, Hannibal Rum, White Lace Duet Gin and White Lace Gin.

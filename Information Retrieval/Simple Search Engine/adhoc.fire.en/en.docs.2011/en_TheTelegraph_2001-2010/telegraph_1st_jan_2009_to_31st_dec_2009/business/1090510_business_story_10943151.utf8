The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Toy tussle to hurt local firms
                                                                                                               Toy tussle to hurt local firms
          R. SURYAMURTHY                          Rules of the game                                  
	New Delhi, May 9: The toy war between India and China may cost domestic manufacturers dear.        
	Bowing to Chinese pressure, the government has allowed the import of toys from that country. At the same time, it is getting ready to introduce safety norms that local companies are not prepared for.        
	Faced with the Chinese threat to lodge a formal complaint with the WTO disputes panel, India has relaxed the toy ban by allowing imports if accompanied by safety certificates of global standards. It has told Beijing that local toy firms will also adhere to the safety standards.        
	The health and consumer affairs ministries are finalising the safety guidelines which the domestic toy industry would have to follow, commerce secretary G.K. Pillai said.         
	According to analysts, much of the domestic toy industry is unorganised and they will find it almost impossible to meet safety standards which may be on a par with international norms.        
	The toy market in India is estimated at Rs 2,500 crore, while the volume-driven, price-competitive Chinese toys are estimated to control 70 per cent of the global toys market.         
	Of the market share of Indian manufacturers, about 55 per cent is with the unorganised sector.        
	Chinese toy imports shall be permitted if accompanied by certificates showing they conform to standards prescribed by safety bodies such as the International Organisation for Standardisation or the American Society for Testing and Materials, the commerce ministry said.        
	Analysts said the difference between the Indian toy industry and the Chinese was that most local toy makers catered to the domestic market,while the Chinese players basically relied on contract manufacturing.

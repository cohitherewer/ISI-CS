          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                            
	Mumbai, Nov. 13: Larsen amp; Toubro (L amp;T) today sold a part of its stake in Mahindra Satyam (formerly Satyam Computer Services) and raised Rs 306 crore.        
	L amp;T divested 27,243,414 shares of Mahindra Satyam  or one-third of its holding in the company  via block deals. The shares were sold to Nomura Mauritius.         
	During the period ended September 30, L amp;T held 6.90 per cent in Mahindra Satyam. This comprised 30,212,750 shares (2.57 per cent) held by L amp;T Capital Company, the investment banking outfit of the group, and 50,919,964 (4.33 per cent) shares by the engineering and construction giant itself. In January, soon after Ramalinga Raju admitted that he had been cooking the Satyam books for several years, L amp;T acquired a 4 per cent stake in Satyam. Later, it raised its holding to 12 per cent.        
	However, this stake came down to 6.9 per cent after Satyams equity capital was expanded following a preferential share allotment to Tech Mahindra, which had emerged as the winning bidder for the troubled infotech giant in April.        
	L amp;Ts average acquisition price was put at Rs 82 per share. It sold these shares today at a price of around Rs 112.50 per share. Thus, the company appears to have made a profit of Rs 30.50 per share, or Rs 83 crore.        
	While L amp;T was keen to acquire Satyam, it lost out in the bidding war to Tech Mahindra, which had offered to pay Rs 1,756 crore for over 30.27 crore shares, representing a 31 per cent stake in the company.        
	Tech Mahindra subsequently came out with an open offer to acquire 20 per cent of Satyam shares from the public. However, as this offer was not successful, it raised its stake through a preferential allotment.         
	In the April auction, Tech Mahindra had bid Rs 58 per share for the promoters stake in Satyam. L amp;T had bid only Rs 45.90 per share, while US billionaire Wilbur Ross had offered Rs 20 per share.        
	Under the terms of the Satyam auction, L amp;T was barred from selling shares in the company for a period of six months. This lock-in period expired in October.        
	L amp;T had been keen to divest the Satyam stake as it did not see it as a strategic investment. Recently, L amp;T sold off its entire 11.49 per cent stake in UltraTech Cement at an average price of Rs 725 per share for Rs 1,037 crore.        
	News of the stake sale saw L amp;T shares closing marginally higher at Rs 1,643.55 on the BSE today. However, the Satyam scrip plunged 6.6 per cent to Rs 109.70.

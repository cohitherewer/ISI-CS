The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Investment breather for LIC
                                                                                                               Investment breather for LIC
                            
	Mumbai, Feb. 22 (PTI): The Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority (IRDA) has said that it would not insist on the LIC bringing down stakes in various companies to 10 per cent in the immediate term.        
	We will not insist on the LIC reducing its stake to 10 per cent for some time, IRDA chairman J. Hari Narayan said. The LIC has an estimated equity exposure of around Rs 2,00,000 crore in listed companies.        
	However, IRDA has told the LIC that it should not hike its stake beyond 10 per cent in those companies where its shareholding is in single digits. Last year, IRDA had said that the LIC should pare down its holding in companies where it holds more than a 10 per cent stake.

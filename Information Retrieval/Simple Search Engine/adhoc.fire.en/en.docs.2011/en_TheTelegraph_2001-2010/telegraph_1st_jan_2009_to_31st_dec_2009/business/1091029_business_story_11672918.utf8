                                                                                                               Infrastructure grows 5% in first half
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                            
	New Delhi, Oct. 28: Infrastructure growth, measured by the performance of the six core sectors, was 5 per cent in the first half of 2009-10 compared with 3.4 per cent a year ago.        
	Analysts said the growth was a positive trend, and it should accelerate in the remaining part of the year.         
	The six core sectors are cement, coal, steel, electricity, crude oil and petroleum refinery products.        
	Growth in September remained unchanged on a year-on-year basis at 4 per cent compared with a healthy expansion of 7.1 per cent in August.         
	According to D.K. Joshi, principal economist with rating agency Crisil, The core sector growth has been fluctuating and one cannot come to any conclusion on a monthly basis. The long term view is that it has grown 5 per cent during the first half of this fiscal, which we expect will be strengthened in the coming months.         
	However, IIP (index of industrial production) for September will not be in double digits, Joshi said.        
	The six core industries, which account for a quarter of the countrys industrial production, had helped factory output to report a robust 10.4 per cent growth in August.        
	Shubhadra Rao, chief economist with Yes Bank, said, The numbers are on an expected line as delayed monsoons had its impact on some of the sectors. The numbers indicate the overall positive trend. The August numbers were an aberration and we expected correction in September.        
	Coal and cement growth, which had led the infrastructure chart in August with impressive growth rates of 12.9 per cent and 17.6 per cent, respectively, slipped to 6.5 per cent each in September, according to official data released today.        
	Crude oil production declined 0.5 per cent in September against a 0.4 per cent fall in the corresponding month last year. In the first six months of the current fiscal, production fell 1.2 per cent compared with a decline of 0.8 per cent during the same period last fiscal.        
	Petroleum refinery output grew 3.4 per cent this September, up from 2.8 per cent in the corresponding month last year.

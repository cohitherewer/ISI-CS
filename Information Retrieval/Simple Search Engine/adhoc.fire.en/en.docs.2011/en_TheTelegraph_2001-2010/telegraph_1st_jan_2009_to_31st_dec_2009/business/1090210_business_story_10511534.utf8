The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Kingfisher makes stake sale pitch to Singapore Airlines
                                                                                                               Kingfisher makes stake sale pitch to Singapore Airlines
          PIYA SINGH                              
	Mumbai, Feb. 9: Vijay Mallya-owned Kingfisher Airlines is in talks with Singapore Airlines for a potential stake sale.        
	The airline, which suffered a loss of Rs 626 crore in the third quarter ended December 31, has been facing a financial crunch like its peers.         
	Talks with Singapore Airlines are at an early stage. Kingfisher recently made a presentation on the airlines operations to senior Singapore Airlines officials. A questionnaire sent to the Kingfisher spokesperson to elicit information on the talks remained unanswered at the time of going to print.         
	Several foreign airlines such as British Airways, Lufthansa, Emirates, Virgin Atlantic and Singapore Airlines have expressed interest in the domestic aviation sector in the past year.        
	If Singapore Airlines is indeed keen to partner Kingfisher, it will be restrained by the prevailing aviation policy that does not allow a foreign airline to pick up a stake in a domestic carrier.         
	Aviation is the only sector with a peculiar rule where foreign investment is allowed but not by entities which have an interest or expertise in that area.         
	However, there has been a growing clamour for a change in the aviation policy to allow investments by foreign carriers in domestic airlines  and the compelling argument for such an amendment is beginning to win support.        
	The government is reported to be mulling over a proposal to allow foreign carriers to pick up a stake of up to 25 per cent in domestic airlines to help the latter tide themselves over the financial crisis.         
	Civil aviation minister Praful Patel recently said it might be time to explore whether foreign airlines could be permitted to invest part of the 49 per cent FDI cap in the domestic aviation sector. He has, however, clarified that no formal decision has been taken on the issue and it is only a thought process.         
	Recently, a news agency reported that Mallya was looking at an equity infusion of Rs 2,000 crore from strategic and financial partners.         
	There have also been reports that Kingfisher has signed a term sheet with a private equity firm in a bid to raise funds.         
	However, in a notice to the BSE, Kingfisher today said, The company is making efforts to raise equity and has been approached by potential investors. As soon as any discussion reaches a mature stage, the stock exchanges will be notified.         
	In response to media queries, we have maintained that we do not comment on price sensitive information, the notice added.

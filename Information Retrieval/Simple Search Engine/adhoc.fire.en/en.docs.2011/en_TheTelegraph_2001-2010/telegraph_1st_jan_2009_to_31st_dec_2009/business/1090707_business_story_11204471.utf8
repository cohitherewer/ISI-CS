The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Oil firms on a slippery track
                                                                                                               Oil firms on a slippery track
          SAMBIT SAHA                                    
	Calcutta, July 6: Oil and gas industry is grappling with a new tax holiday regime, proposed in the budget today, which may change the way hydrocarbon exploration and production business is done in India.        
	The initial reading of the finance bill reveals that the new regime could impact the profitability of the upstream oil and gas majors like ONGC, Reliance and Cairn if they do not make sweeping changes in production plans.        
	So far fields within a single block awarded under New Exploration Licensing Policy (NELP) used to get 7 years tax holiday from the day each goes to production.        
	From now on the seven-year period would be calculated for the entire block awarded under a single contract from the day any one of the field goes to production.        
	The old regime has meant that whenever any field/well goes to production, the produce would qualify for 7 years of holiday.         
	As a result, all oil and gas produced from a block would qualify for tax break. This was critical the way industry made investment and expected return as any block takes 4 to 5 years to reach peak production.        
	Under the regime, as many fears, the break would evaporate by the time peak production reaches. As a result, bulk of the produce from a field would not enjoy the benefit of tax holiday.        
	When contacted to react on the changes proposed in the budget, petroleum minister Murli Deora chose not comment.        
	Petroleum secretary R.S. Pandey said he would need time to read the fine print before commenting on the development.        
	The Clause 37 of the Finance Bill reads : It is further proposed to provide by way of an Explanation that for the purposes of claiming deduction under 80 (1B) of Income Tax Act, all blocks licensed under a single contract which is, awarded under the NELP announced by the Government of India vide Resolution No.-19018/22/95-ONG.DO.VL dated 10th February 1999 or has been awarded in pursuance of any law for the time being in force or has been awarded by the Central or State Government in any other manner, shall be treated as a single undertaking.        
	Now, the company may try to defer announcement of commercial production unless it is ready to hit production from the first day.        
	We are yet to figure out what exactly the new regime means, but it looks like a big change, an oil industry executive said.        
	Pricing system        
	The finance minister said an expert group would be set up to advise on a viable and sustainable system of pricing petroleum products.         
	The details about it would be announced by minister of petroleum and natural gas Murli Deora later. The industry had expected a clearer roadmap for oil price decontrol in the budget.        
	The minister also extend the tax holiday under section 80-IB(9) of the Income Tax Act, which was hitherto available in respect of profits arising from the commercial production or refining of mineral oil, also to natural gas as India gears up boom in natural gas production.                           
	The budget also proposed investment linked tax incentives to business of laying and operating cross country natural gas or crude or petroleum oil pipeline network for distribution on common carrier principle.

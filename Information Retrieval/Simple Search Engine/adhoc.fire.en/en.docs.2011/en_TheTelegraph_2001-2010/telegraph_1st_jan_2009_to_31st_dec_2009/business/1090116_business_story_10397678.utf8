	New Delhi, Jan. 15: Inflation fell to an 11-month low of 5.24 per cent for the week ended January 3, prompting the finance ministry to project that it will come down to 3-4 per cent by the end of this fiscal.         
	We are seeing a robust and healthy decline in inflation. The expectation is that inflation will come down to a still more manageable number, that is, between 3 per cent and 4 per cent, by the end of March, economic affairs secretary Ashok Chawla said.        
	Inflation fell 0.67 per cent to 5.24 per cent for the week ended January 3 from 5.91 per cent in the previous week. It stood at 4.26 per cent a year ago.        
	According to analysts, the Reserve Bank of India may not cut interest rates in its monetary policy review later this month.         
	It has already taken a series of steps to stimulate the economy and even without any more intervention, inflation is expected to fall big because of the falling price of crude.

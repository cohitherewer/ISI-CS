                              Prime Minister Manmohan Singh with South African President Jacob Zuma in Pittsburgh on Friday. (PTI)                            
	Pittsburgh, Sept. 26 (PTI): Prime Minister Manmohan Singh today assured South Africa that there would be no discrimination against the proposed $23-billion merger deal between Bharti and MTN, facing the hurdle of dual listing.        
	As far as the MTN issue is concerned, I mentioned it to (South African President) Jacob Zuma. I sincerely hope that this deal would go through and there will be no discrimination against it, he told reporters in reply to a question at a press conference here.        
	Bharti and MTN are currently engaged in exclusive talks till September 30 for a possible merger deal involving cash-and-share swap to create the worlds third largest telecom operator with over 200 million subscribers.        
	Two recent developments  changes in the takeover norms, announced by market regulator Sebi and South Africas demand to allow dual listing of MTN in order to retain its identity  had raised concerns over the fate of the deal.        
	Supporting the Bharti groups efforts to acquire a stake in MTN and hoping that the deal would go through, Singh said officials of the two countries would discuss the issue.        
	Commenting on the deal, particularly the dual listing clause, union finance minister Pranab Mukherjee had recently said, We welcome the deal, but it should be in context of existing laws of the land. These have to be kept in mind.         
	According to the initial agreement, MTN and its shareholders would acquire 36 per cent stake in Bharti while Bharti would hold a 49 per cent stake in MTN.        
	The process would see a transaction of $13 billion in cash and $10 billion in shares.        
	South Africa has said it was working closely with India on the proposed deal that requires exemptions on a range of exchange-control regulations.        
	We have received an application from MTN for an exemption on a range of exchange-control regulations, and due process is being followed. The South African government is working closely with the Indian government through their finance ministries.        
	It would be important that such mergers are not only of benefit to the two companies, but to both countries as well, Thoraya Pandy, a spokesperson of the South African government, said.        
	Earlier this week, a delegation from South Africa had held discussions with Sebi, the RBI and finance ministry officials. A decision on the contentious issue of dual listing was likely to be taken soon.        
	Sources also said the two companies might extend the exclusive talks period beyond September 30 to work out an alternative structure of the deal.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                            
	Mumbai, Sept. 25: Sesa Goa, a Vedanta group mining company, plans to raise Rs 6,000 crore from the domestic or international markets.         
	News of the plan led to the scrip taking a hit on fears of an equity dilution. On the BSE, Sesa closed 5.6 per cent lower at Rs 256.80.         
	At a meeting on Thursday, the board of directors approved a capital expenditure proposal of Rs 605 crore ($125 million) to increase the capacity of Sesas pig iron plant by 3.75 lakh tonnes, expand met coke capacity and set up a waste heat recovery power plant. The company informed these to the bourses today.         
	The company will convene an extraordinary general meeting on October 20 to seek the approval of shareholders to raise funds by up to Rs 6,000 crore in the form of foreign currency convertible bonds (FCCBs), qualified institutional placements to qualified institutional bidders, American depository receipts, global depository receipts, non convertible debentures, warrants or any other security according to the statutory regulations prevailing at the time when the transaction is done.         
	The company has also announced the terms of a previously announced FCCB offering. The size of the offer is $500 million.         
	According to Sesa Goa, the FCCBs will have a coupon of 5 per cent per annum. They will be payable semi-annually and convertible into equity shares of the company. The conversion price has been set at Rs 346.88 per share, representing a premium of 28 per cent to the reference price of Rs 271 per share.         
	Proceeds from the offering will be used to expand its mining operations, explore new resources and further develop its pig iron and metallurgical coke operations.         
	The company will follow the external commercial borrowing regulations of the Reserve Bank of India while using the proceeds, Sesa Goa said.        
	The proposed offering of the FCCB is, however, subject to shareholders approval.         
	Recently, Vedanta Resources had hiked its stake in Sesa Goa. Vedanta increased its stake to 57.12 per cent after its subsidiary Westglobe acquired an additional 1.73 crore equity shares through open market purchases.

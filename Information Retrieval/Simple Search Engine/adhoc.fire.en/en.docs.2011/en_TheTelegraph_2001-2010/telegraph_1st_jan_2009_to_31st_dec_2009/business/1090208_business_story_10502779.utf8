The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | IMF resource worry
                                                                                                               IMF resource worry
                            
	Kuala Lumpur, Feb. 7 (PTI): The International Monetary Fund (IMF) may run out of resources in the next 6-8 months as the current financial crisis could require more funds, managing director Dominique Strauss-Kahn said today.        
	Today, the IMFs resources are enough to face the current situation but because we are facing a global crisis, the needs may be much bigger than previously. We have to intervene in Asia, Africa, central Europe, Latin America and may be elsewhere. I cant promise that in 6-8 months from now, we will have enough resources, he told reporters here.        
	Citing Japans offer to add $100 billion to the funds resources, Strauss-Kahn urged other countries to follow suit.         
	Earlier, at the 44th Governors Conference of the Southeast Asian Central Banks here, Strauss-Kahn commended central banks across Asia for being alert and acting swiftly by reducing interest rates to stimulate economic activity.         
	He said the Reserve Bank of India and the Bank of Korea had perhaps been the most aggressive in cutting interest rates.        
	Strauss-Kahn said monetary policy alone would not be enough to offset the disruption in financial markets and the severity of the downturn, adding that not every country could undertake fiscal stimulus.         
	The IMF chief expressed confidence in Asian banks noting that they were generally stronger than before and would be in a good position when the economy recovered.         
	He felt some countries might need to contract their budgets rather than expand them and named China as an important case in point.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                            
	Mumbai, Jan. 14: HDFC Bank today reported 45 per cent growth in its net profit for the third quarter ended December 31, 2008. Net profit of the bank grew to Rs 621.74 crore from Rs 429.36 crore in the corresponding period last year.        
	The private sector bank, however, said the results for the two quarters were not comparable.        
	The latest result for the period ended December 31, 2008, is for the merged entity. Centurion Bank of Punjab was earlier merged with the bank.         
	Although the results were in line with analyst estimates, there was some worry for the bank because of its growing non-performing assets (NPAs).         
	Though the figures are not comparable, gross NPAs in absolute terms shot up to Rs 1,911.41 crore in the latest quarter from Rs 866.97 crore in the year-ago period. The share of gross NPAs to gross advances rose to 1.9 per cent from 1.2 per cent.        
	HDFC Bank said provisions and contingencies for the quarter rose to Rs 531.8 crore, comprising primarily of loan loss provisions of Rs 465.4 crore.        
	The total income of the bank for the quarter grew 58.8 per cent to Rs 5,407.9 crore over the corresponding quarter ended December 31, 2007.         
	According to the bank, net revenues (net interest income and other income) stood at Rs 2,918.6 crore for the quarter, an increase of 37.9 per cent over Rs 2,116.5 crore in the year-ago quarter.        
	Net interest income increased 37.7 per cent to Rs 1,979.3 crore, driven by an average asset growth of 44.1 per cent and a net interest margin of around 4.3 per cent during the quarter ended December 31, 2008, the bank said.        
	The banks balance sheet size increased 39.4 per cent to Rs 183,185 crore as on December 31, 2008.         
	Total deposits were Rs 144,862 crore, an increase of 45.8 per cent over December 31, 2007. Its total customer assets, including advances and others, increased to Rs 100,682 crore from Rs 74,979 crore a year ago, a growth of 34.3 per cent. Retail loans at Rs 59,647 crore form 59.6 per cent of the gross advances.

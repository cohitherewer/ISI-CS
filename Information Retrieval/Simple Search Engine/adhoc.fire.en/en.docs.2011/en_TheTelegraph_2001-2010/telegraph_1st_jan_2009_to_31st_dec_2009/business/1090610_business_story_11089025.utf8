The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Satyam springs profit surprise
                                                                                                               Satyam springs profit surprise
          OUR BUREAU                                            
	Mumbai, June 9: Fraud-scarred Satyam Computer Services stunned the markets today with the announcement of an unaudited consolidated net profit of just over Rs 160 crore for the third quarter ended December 31 and a bank balance of Rs 373 crore.        
	Satyam put in the public domain a 40-page document containing a trove of unverified facts and figures that it had shared with the bidders for the software giant that was rocked by revelations which snowballed into the countrys worst corporate fraud.        
	The Satyam stock jumped almost 10 per cent to Rs 66.85 and hit the upper circuit filter, which immediately froze trading in the stock.        
	The fourth largest software exporter  acquired by Tech Mahindra in April with a winning bid of Rs 58 a share  said it earned a stand-alone net profit of Rs 181 crore on income from services worth Rs 2,294 crore in the third quarter.        
	The disclosures come with a caveat: there can be no assurance that any of the information in the statement is accurate and the actual results may be materially higher or lower than projected.        
	The company said it was making the disclosures in abundant caution as Tech Mahindras offer to buy Satyam shares from minority shareholders could run foul of the anti-fraud rules framed by the US market regulator if it didnt first disclose all material facts. The Satyam share is listed on the New York Stock Exchange.        
	Tech Mahindra has already acquired a controlling interest of 31 per cent and plans to raise its holding to 51 per cent through an open offer to minority shareholders at the bid price. It will have to fork out Rs 1,154 crore for this stake purchase.        
	Satyam fell off a cliff after founder B. Ramalinga Raju confessed on January 7 that he had cooked the books for several years by padding profits and revenues, and creating fictitious bank balances.        
	Strong margins        
	The company also came out with figures for the first two months of January and February. Many were surprised with Satyams strong profit margins.        
	Many had expected Satyam to report operating profit margins in single digits. But it reported an operating profit margin of around 17 per cent, which is very good. It may not be to hard to scale this up to over 22 per cent, said Apurva Shah, head of research at Prabhudas Liladher, a brokerage.        
	Shah said the companys revenues for the year 2008-09 would be closer to $1.8 billion, way ahead of earlier estimates of $1.3 billion. This shows that operationally, its not all that bad, he added.        
	Not everyone, however, was gung-ho over the Satyam numbers. The numbers are irrelevant as they are dated. Raju made the declaration in January so the business was not expected to hurt substantially in February as clients take time to migrate. These figures do not reflect the actual position of the company, said an analyst with a Mumbai-based brokerage who has been tracking the stock.        
	Satyam also said its bank balances for the months of January, February and March 2009 totalled Rs 373 crore. Loans during the three-month period ended March 2009 amounted to Rs 469 crore. However, it hasnt yet drawn down on sanctioned loans of about Rs 316 crore from three banks  IDBI, Bank of Baroda and HDFC Bank.         
	As of March 31, Satyams mark to market losses were estimated at Rs 110 crore, while the total value of outstanding forward and options contract was $164 million.         
	Satyam received new business orders from 215 customers with contract values totalling $380 million as of March 26. Customer losses amounted to $92 million in the quarter ended December 31, 2008 and $91 million spread over the next 12 months.         
	More than 2,000 employees of the software maker quit in the first two months of this calendar year after Rajus confessions. Between April 2008 and February 2009, 7,926 employees left the company.        
	Disputes and claims        
	The big surprise in the disclosure related to claims worth Rs 1,230 crore from 37 companies, which Satyam hasnt acknowledged till date. The company said the matter was under investigation by various authorities.         
	Later this month, the company could find itself sucked into a major legal battle arising from class action suits filed by US-based shareholders. The class action suits have been consolidated and a US district court will decide on a lead plaintiff before the case can proceed. The company said it would defend itself vigorously against these claims.

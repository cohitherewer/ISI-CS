	Calcutta, Dec. 13: Bengal has received in-principle approval from the central government to set up a 650 mega watt (MW) hydel power plant in Bhutan for use solely within the state, power minister Mrinal Banerjee said.        
	The proposal for the hydel power unit, across the states border with the neighbouring Himalayan country, had received sanction recently, Banerjee said. The proposal was mooted earlier this year.        
	Moloy De, chairman of West Bengal State Electricity Distribution Company Limited, said the water of the Torsa, which is known as the Amochu in Bhutan, would be utilised to generate power that would be exclusively fed into the state grid.        
	He said besides the 650MW project, the government had been negotiating with Bhutan for two other plants using the Torsa. These were of higher capacities in the region of 900MW- 1,000MW.        
	A decision on the size would be taken after a discussion with the central government.        
	Consulate in city        
	Landlocked Bhutan, for which Bengals land route and the state port are the exclusive gateway for supplies from international sources, has recently opened a consulate in the city.        
	Bhutans external affairs minister Lynpo Ugyen Tshering will formally inaugurate the consulate, located at Mall Road in Dum Dum, on Thursday.        
	Dasho Tsering Wangda, the consul-general of Bhutan in the city, said a fruit and tourism fair would he held from December 17-19 to showcase the resources and potential of the country. He said people visiting the country would now be able to get their travel documents done in the city. At present, an Indian tourist is required to procure an entry permit from the immigration office in Phuentsholing, the border town in Bhutan.        
	Wangda said over Rs 100 crore worth of fruits and vegetables from Bhutan were exported to India every year, the bulk of which is consumed in North Bengal and Assam.

	Calcutta, Nov. 14: The government is likely to rake in around Rs 32,000 crore by selling stakes in NMDC and Steel Authority of India Ltd (SAIL).        
	While the Centre expects to raise Rs 13,000 crore from the NMDC divestment, stake sale in SAIL is likely to fetch Rs 19,000 crore, Union steel secretary Atul Chaturvedi said.        
	The department of divestment has given an in-principle approval for a 10 per cent follow-on public offer of SAIL. The government will offload another 10 per cent in SAIL in two tranches. The proceeds from the stake sale will fund the steel majors expansion.        
	Steel minister Virbhadra Singh said the divestment proposals would be placed before the cabinet by December.        
	Chaturvedi and Singh were talking to reporters on the sidelines of the 47th National Metallurgists Day Celebration of the Indian Institute of Metals. Tata Steel vice-chairman B. Muthuraman received the IIM-JRD Tata Award at the event.        
	According to the government, there should be at least 10 per cent public holding in listed companies.         
	The steel ministry has already approved an 8.38 per cent sale of government equity in NMDC.        
	Singh said both the disvestment cases were being pursued simultaneously and would be completed in the current financial year.        
	The Centre unveiled its divestment programme yesterday. There are 50 central PSUs that are making profits but are unlisted, while 10 firms are listed but have less than 10 per cent public holding.        
	Venture fund        
	Chaturvedi said the steel ministry was in talks with a few financial institutions to promote a venture capital fund for exploring mining opportunities of iron ore.        
	Prospecting of mines, which is the first step towards mining, is a high-risk venture. Unless there is certainty in converting prospecting licence into mining licence, it is difficult to attract investment to this sector, Chaturvedi said on the sidelines of a separate event of the Merchant Chamber of Commerce.        
	Prospecting of a mine is an expensive venture which require risk capital, he said.        
	Singh today said the countrys production at the end of the year would be 60 million tonnes compared with 57 million tonnes last year.

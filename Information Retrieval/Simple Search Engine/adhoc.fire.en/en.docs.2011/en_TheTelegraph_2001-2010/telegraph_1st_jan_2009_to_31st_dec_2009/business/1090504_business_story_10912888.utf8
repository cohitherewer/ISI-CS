          AMY WILSON                               
	Omaha (Nebraska), May 3: Warren Buffett, the billionaire investor, yesterday faced shareholder demands to name his successor following five consecutive quarters of declining profit at Berkshire Hathaway.        
	India-born Ajit Jain is in the fray to take over the reins from Buffett.        
	Buffetts job will be split between his son Howard, who will become chairman, and an unidentified CEO and chief investment officer. All the candidates for the post of CEO work for Berkshire Hathaway. David Sokol, head of Berkshires MidAmerican Energy; Tony Nicely, who runs the firms Geico car insurance business; and Ajit Jain, who runs its reinsurance business are among the contenders.

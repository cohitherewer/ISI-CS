The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | DLF resorts to asset sale
                                                                                                               DLF resorts to asset sale
          JAYATI GHOSE                          Realty bites                                  
	New Delhi, April 11: Real estate developer DLF is planning to sell assets, including land, to overcome a cash crunch.        
	The New Delhi-based company needs to raise around Rs 2,000 crore to buy back private equity player DE Shaws stake in DLF Assets Limited.         
	With rentals from commercial and retail buildings falling, borrowing from banks and financial institutions could be difficult. So, DLF has to look at other sources of raising capital, said a real estate analyst.         
	According to a report by ICICI Securities, DLF may also need Rs 2,700 crore additional capital in the next two years to maintain its cash flow.        
	DLF is said to be pushing back its hotel plans by 12-18 months because of the tough credit environment, said sources.         
	The company declined to comment on its asset sale and project delays as it is in the silent period prior to the announcement of its fourth-quarter results.        
	In February, DLF had said it would focus on the sale of non-strategic and non-core assets, including excess land in some projects. For the third quarter ended December 2008, DLF suffered a 69 per cent fall in net profit at Rs 671 crore.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | More of a token gesture
                                                                                                               More of a token gesture
				                                     
	Rajat Majumdar is a 61-year-old retired government officer. His income is around Rs 2.5 lakh. In 2008-09, he invested in a Senior Citizens Savings Scheme. But, he could not get higher exemptions because being below 65 years of age, he is not a senior citizen, according to the income tax law.        
	Budget reaction: I hoped the disparity in the definition of senior citizens would be rectified. But it wasnt. I am disappointed. I wouldnt have to pay any income tax had they redefined senior citizens for income tax purposes as people who are 60 years or more.    
	Kallol Debnath is 27 years old. His annual salary is Rs 4 lakh. He saved a large part of his Rs 36,000 tax outgo by buying life and medical insurance and investing in ELSS. He has an education loan and the interest payment on this loan also helps him save tax.        
	Budget reaction: An increase of Rs 10,000 in the basic exemption limit on annual income is okay, but not enough. I expected it to be raised to Rs 1,80,000  the threshold allowed for women. This is a disappointment for me. Low and middle-income people do not get much from this budget.                
	Ashmita (34) and Anirban (35) Banerjee are a working couple. They have a school-going kid. Together, they earn around Rs 7 lakh a year and each of the couple pays his/her income tax separately. To reduce their income tax burden, Ashmita and Anirban bought life insurance policies worth Rs 18 lakh and a family floater medical insurance. They claim deduction on the tuition fees of their daughter. They also have a joint housing loan.   
	Budget reaction: The increase of Rs 10,000 in the basic exemption limit is not much, given the steep increase in prices of daily needs. The plan to set up a panel to review oil pricing mechanism is a worry because if prices of oil and gas rise, it will affect us as we have to travel a lot.    
	Debabrata Majumdar and Rajlakshmi Guha Majumdar are both medical practitioners in a government hospital. Together, they earn more than Rs 4.5 lakh a year. As neither of them has a huge tax burden, their annual premium payment of Rs 9 lakh towards life insurance policies and investments in NSC are sufficient to take care of their tax savings.   
	Budget reaction: The increase in the basic exemption limit for tax purposes is welcome. We expected higher tax concessions for medical insurance and other investments under Section 80C. More tax benefit to home loans was also expected. But that didnt come through.    
	Twenty-nine-year-old Soma Banerjee works in a publication house. Her annual income is Rs 3 lakh. She has bought a life insurance policy for Rs 15 lakh and opened a PPF account with an annual contribution of Rs 50,000. She plans to take a car loan and wishes the basic exemption limit on income for women is increased this year.        
	Budget reaction: Im happy that the basic exemption limit on income has been increased. There is no major stimulus for economic revival. I plan to buy an LCD television because customs duty on LCD panels has been reduced.    
	Forty-seven-year-old Pratim Chowdhury is self-employed. He earns about Rs 15 lakh a year. Chowdhury didnt care much about tax saving because he could save a little of his huge tax liability. He bought an equity-linked life insurance plan. Rather, Chowdhury wants relief on various investments and abolition of fringe benefit tax.  
	Budget reaction: Withdrawal of FBT is a good proposal for businessmen like us. Increase in the basic exemption limit on income for senior citizens is a welcome move as they will have more income at their disposal. For others, an increase of Rs 10,000 wont mean much.    
	Sixty-eight-year-old Mrinal Kanti Ghosh earns about Rs 12 lakh a year. He has invested in ELSS and tax-saving FDs of banks. He still has to pay nearly Rs 2 lakh as income tax. Ghosh wants the basic exemption limit for income to be increased and additional tax benefits for senior citizens on interest income from FDs and medical insurance premium.         
	Budget reaction: The removal of surcharge on income tax is a welcome step. So is the removal of FBT. Otherwise, the budget doesnt have much to cheer about. It has little measures to bring down inflation

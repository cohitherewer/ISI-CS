        You can bank on the immediate annuity plans of life insurance companies as they offer a guaranteed source of income after retirement, says Srikumar Bondyopadhyay                                        
	Immediate annuity plans of life insurance companies can be your answer to a regular source of income post retirement.         
	Under the plan, you can invest Rs 2 lakh and earn Rs 1,300 a month throughout your lifetime. If you want your wife to continue getting an assured income after your death, the monthly income will be slightly less at Rs 1,150.         
	This may not sound very convincing at the face of it. But consider a person who is 40-years-old. If he invests Rs 1,000 every month, the investment will grow to Rs 14,13,721 after 20 years at a 15 per cent annual compounded return.         
	By the time the investor attains the retirement age of 60 years, he has already built a kitty of Rs 14,13,721.         
	In addition to this, he will continue to earn Rs 1,300 a month as long as he lives from the initial investment of Rs 2 lakh. The retirement corpus of Rs 14,13,721 will fetch the investor a monthly income of Rs 9,425 at an interest rate of 8 per cent. Thus, the investors total income post-retirement will be Rs 10,725 a month.         
	In short, an investment of Rs 2 lakh now will fetch the investor a post-retirement monthly income of Rs 10,725.         
	Simple solution        
	The way to ensure a steady income post retirement is simple. First, you buy an immediate annuity plan from an insurer. Almost all life insurers are now selling immediate annuity plans.         
	An immediate annuity plan is a single premium product and a buyer starts getting the annuity income immediately after paying the premium.         
	The amount of annuity income depends on the age of the policy buyer and also on the frequency of the payout.         
	A 40-year-old person will get a lower payout than a 60-year-old. The annuity amount is more if the payment is received once a year than every month.         
	Besides, there are various payout options. For example, if you want to receive the annuity benefit as long as you live and without the return of the purchase price, the instalment will be higher.         
	You can also go in for a joint life option wherein after your death, your spouse will continue to receive the annuity till he/she survives.        
	In Table 1, we have considered the annuity rates currently being offered by ICICI Prudential Life Insurance Company under various payout options.         
	ICICI Prudential is the only life insurance company that has provided an online calculator where a prospective buyer can get annuity quotations at the current offered rate for different purchase prices (premium).         
	Advantage points        
	Remember, the annuity amount depends on the prevailing interest rates. When the interest rates are low, annuity rates also go down and vice-versa. But once an annuity option is chosen, it cannot be changed and the annuity payable thereon is guaranteed for ones life, irrespective of the changes in the market rates. This is the advantage of an annuity plan over other assured income instruments, such as bank fixed deposits or small savings schemes.         
	Interest income from a bank fixed deposit or a small savings scheme is subject to change on renewals. But the annuity rates are guaranteed for life.        
	This gives investors some freedom to plan for investments without worrying about the fixed income flow from annuities.        
	Table 1 illustrates that a 45-year-old person gets an annual annuity income of Rs 15,493 throughout his life from an initial investment of Rs 2 lakh.         
	ICICI Prudential Life Insurance Company doesnt sell immediate annuity plans to those below 45 years of age. But other insurers such as HDFC Standard Life sells such plans to people as young as 30 years.         
	Besides, the annuity rates corresponding to a given age group vary widely from one insurer to another. So, before you hit upon an immediate annuity plan, check out the rates offered by different insurers and select the one that pays you the highest.        
	As shown in Table 1, the annuity payment will stop and there will be no refund of the purchase price (Rs 2 lakh) after the death of the annuitant. The annual income will also be a tad lower if you want your spouse to get the annuity income or the capital investment refunded after your death.        
	Growth options        
	Table 2 shows how an investment of Rs 15,000 every year in various instruments will grow at different return rates.         
	The investment will grow to Rs 12,96,632 after 15 years growing at an annual compounded rate of 20 per cent. But the assumption of an annual compounded return of 20 per cent for 15 years will be too far fetched. In the last 18 years, the 30-share BSE sensex has given a 16.5 per cent compounded annual return.         
	However, the top 10 diversified equity funds have given an annual return of more than 30 per cent in the last five years compared with 24.63 per cent of the BSE sensex.        
	Even at a 15 per cent annual compounded return, systematic investment of Rs 15,000 every year in a diversified mutual fund will grow to Rs 8,20,762 in 15 years.         
	Thus, the 45-year-old investor in our example will amass a retirement kitty of Rs 8,20,762 at the time of his retirement. Besides, he will continue to get an annual annuity income of Rs 15,493 till survival. It is, however, interesting to note that a 30-year-old person buying an annual annuity of Rs 10,000 with the same capital of Rs 2 lakh can accumulate Rs 18,09,434 lakh by the time of his retirement even at a lower investment return of 10 per cent.

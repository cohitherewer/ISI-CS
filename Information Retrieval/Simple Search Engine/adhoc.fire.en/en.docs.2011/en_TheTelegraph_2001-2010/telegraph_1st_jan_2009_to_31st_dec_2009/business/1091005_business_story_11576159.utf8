                                                                                                                 Q amp;A      Tedious wait
                                I was allotted PAN/GIR No. AAAPM2030L while in service in New Delhi, but I didnt get the PAN card as it was under printing at the computer office at RK Puram. The officer-in-charge there had assured me to dispatch the PAN card. I am now 71 years old and relocated to Calcutta. I have not yet received the card, though I had sent several reminders to the income tax department. Recently, I got a letter from the assistant director of income tax (PAN) who has advised me to contact UTIISL office at Gulab Bhawan, New Delhi. Accordingly I contacted them with all the documents in August. But I am yet to get the PAN card in absence of which I cannot open a bank account or an SCSS account. What should I do?          Tapan Kumar Majumdar, Behala
                    You contact Susheeba Alex, branch-in-charge at the UTIISL office at 29, NS Road, ground floor (opposite Gillandar House) in Calcutta, and seek her opinion on the matter. You can also know the status of your PAN application by logging on to http://www.utitsl.co.in/utitsl/site/pantracker.jsp. Otherwise, you can make a grievance application in Form CSF and submit it at the above mentioned office.                                  Interest income      I deposited less than Rs 9 lakh in Post office MIS accounts. Some of these accounts are in joint names with my wife and my married daughter. I used to show in my tax return the interest income from those accounts where my name appeared as first account holder. At present, being a senior citizen I am not filing tax return for my income is much below the basic exemption limit. My wife has no other income and my daughter has got a service this year. My daughters income is taxable. What will be the tax implication of the interest income from the MIS account for my daughter?        N. Banerjee, Calcutta
                    As your wife doesnt have any other income, the interest income from her MIS account would have to be clubbed with your income. In your daughters case, you had not mentioned whether the MIS account was opened in her name when she was a minor or when she became an adult. According to tax laws, a minors income has to be clubbed with her parents income, in this case yours. However, your daughter now will have to show the interest income in her tax return and pay tax accordingly.

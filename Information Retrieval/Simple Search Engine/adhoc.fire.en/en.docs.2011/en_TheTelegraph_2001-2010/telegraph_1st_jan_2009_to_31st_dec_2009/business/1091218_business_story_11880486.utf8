	Calcutta, Dec. 17: Coal India Ltd (CIL) has started the process of its initial public offering by inviting expressions of interest from independent financial advisers.        
	The public sector coal behemoth has floated a tender seeking consultants to divest a 10 per cent government equity through a public issue.        
	We plan to list CILs shares on the NSE and the BSE by November next year, said Partha S. Bhattacharya, chairman of Coal India Ltd.        
	Our IPO will entirely be a stake sale by the government without any fresh equity issue because CIL doesnt need to raise fresh capital. The sale proceeds of the IPO will accrue to the government, the CIL chairman said.        
	The government will divest its 10 per cent holding in Coal India, which has a paid-up capital of Rs 6,316 crore. Around Rs 630 crore, excluding any premium, will be raised through the IPO.        
	We are hopeful of getting a very good valuation, Bhattacharya said.        
	CIL had a turnover of Rs 45,790 crore and a net profit of Rs 2,079 crore as of March 2009. However, the companys net profit is expected to be much lower in the current financial year after the implementation of a new wage pact.        
	The company runs 473 mines in eight states, produces 85 per cent of the countrys coal and meets 46 per cent of the nations commercial energy needs.        
	Coal India has 4,12,000 employees on its rolls.

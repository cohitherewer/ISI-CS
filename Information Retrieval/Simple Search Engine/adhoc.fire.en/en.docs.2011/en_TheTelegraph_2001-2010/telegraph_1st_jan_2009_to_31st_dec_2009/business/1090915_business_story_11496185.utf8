The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Cautious strategy pays off for banks
                                                                                                               Cautious strategy pays off for banks
          JAYATI GHOSE                      Past tense: The picture shows a Lehman Brothers employee   leaving the company rsquo;s European headquarters   in the UK. (AFP)                          
	New Delhi, Sept. 14: Indian banks would continue to be prudent and conservative in their approach towards lending and investment  a mantra that insulated them from the Lehman debacle.        
	The domestic financial system remained largely insulated from the global financial crisis as they almost entirely avoided buying the mortgage-backed securities and credit default swaps that turned toxic and felled many western financial institutions.        
	For India, the lesson is to discourage short-term (volatile) off-shore flows and roll out liberalisation measures to attract long-term, stable foreign funds, J. Moses Harding, Head  Global Markets Group, IndusInd Bank, told The Telegraph.        
	The only impact on Indian markets was the market volatility that followed the crisis when offshore investors started withdrawing funds, he said. Foreign institutional investors pulled an estimated $13 billion out of the domestic bourses in 2008.        
	Bankers said the crisis highlighted the pitfalls of excessive leverage of capital, overexposure to investment products, financial greed ahead of investment prudence, poor risk management practices and a lack of board-level awareness.         
	Awareness of prudential norms, maintenance of credit margins and not lending without security are some of the lessons that the banking system has taken from the crisis, said U.S. Bhargava, former executive director of Punjab National Bank.        
	More lenders are now relying on data from Credit Information Bureau (India) Ltd (Cibil) before disbursing any loans. Cibil provides credit information and repayment record of the loan seeker.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Sensex recovers after early reverses
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Sensex recovers after early reverses
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                            
	Mumbai, Nov. 27: Stocks cratered this morning spooked by the talk of a Dubai debt crisis but then burst out of the depths after reassuring talk from the government, industry and market analysts soothed the markets frazzled nerves.        
	Even after recovering 644 points, the BSE sensex closed at 16632.01, a drop of 222.92 points over its last close, with news from Dubai clearly weighing on stocks.        
	Banks and real estate were flattened by the tidal wave of selling amid reports that two state-owned firms in Dubai would seek to roll over some of the $60-billion debt on their books.        
	While the sensex opened lower at 16718.80, it fell to an intra-day low of 16210.44 as investors dumped stocks. The government said there was no real cause for worry even as a number of brokerage analysts said Indian entities had little exposure to Dubais economy. Short-covering also contributed to the rally.        
	It (the crisis) is unlikely to deter the liquidity flows towards the Indian bourses, which provide the global investors an exposure to the high growth and profitability destination. Hence, investors should use the opportunity provided from the knee-jerk reaction of the markets to enhance exposure to equities, said Dinesh Thakkar, chairman of Angel Broking.        
	However, an analyst cautioned that though only a handful of Indian companies may be affected by the developments in Dubai, a strong rally cannot be expected in the immediate term.        
	We had also thought that the financial crisis was over. But it isnt. The current developments will certainly hit investor sentiment, said an analyst who did not wish to be identified.         
	The focus during the day was clearly on those stocks, particularly from the real estate and banking space, which investors thought had some exposure to Dubai.        
	Bank of Baroda, for instance, which has some real estate exposure in Dubai, saw its shares ending 4.64 per cent lower at Rs 521.40. Similarly, Omaxe, which has two real estate projects there, also saw its shares ending lower by 2.25 per cent at Rs 93.25.                          
	On the other hand, Spicejet, the low cost carrier in which Dubai Worlds Istithmar is a stakeholder, ended with a loss of 4.44 per cent at Rs 45.15.        
	Larsen amp; Toubro, which has exposures to the Middle East, saw its shares closing lower by 2.7 per cent at Rs 1586.50.

                                                                                                               Govt men to fly AI to save airline
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, July 13: The finance ministry today made it mandatory for government personnel to use Air India for all official domestic and international tours.        
	The move is expected to help Air India to minimise its losses, which ran up to over Rs 5,000 crore during 2008-09. Sources said government revenues accounted for about 10 per cent of the airlines income.         
	It has been decided that in all cases of air travel, both domestic and international, where the government bears the cost of air passage, the officials concerned may travel only by Air India, the finance ministry said.        
	While travelling to places not connected by Air India, officials may take an Air India flight to the point closest to their destination, from where they may board another airline, preferably an alliance partner of the national carrier.         
	These orders will also apply to officials in autonomous bodies funded by the government, it said.         
	The ministry said if it was not possible to comply with the norms, individual cases might be referred to the civil aviation ministry for relaxation.         
	Air India has been seeking an equity infusion of about Rs 1,250 crore and soft loans of around Rs 3,000 crore from the government.         
	However, it needs to come up with a restructuring plan to get the bailout package.

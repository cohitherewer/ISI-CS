The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Parsvnath posts profit
                                                                                                               Parsvnath posts profit
                            
	New Delhi, Oct. 14 (PTI): Realty firm Parsvnath Developers has posted a nearly three-fold jump in net profit at Rs 61.42 crore for the quarter ended September 30 against Rs 21.90 crore a year ago.        
	Total revenue, however, declined to Rs 200.77 crore from Rs 226.36 crore a year ago.        
	Our profit has increased because of the sale of 4 per cent equity for Rs 25 crore in the La Tropicana housing project in Delhi, various cost-cutting measures, and a write-back of tax expense, Parsvnath chairman Pradeep Jain said. The firm has cut down its employee strength by around 70 people, which helped it save about Rs 1 crore a month.        
	The firm has written back Rs 19.86 crore of tax expenses as the government has extended the incentive for the development of affordable houses under section 80-IB(10) of the income tax act. On debt position, Jain said it stood at Rs 1,590 crore as on September 30 and planned to reduce the borrowings to Rs 800-900 crore by the end of this fiscal.

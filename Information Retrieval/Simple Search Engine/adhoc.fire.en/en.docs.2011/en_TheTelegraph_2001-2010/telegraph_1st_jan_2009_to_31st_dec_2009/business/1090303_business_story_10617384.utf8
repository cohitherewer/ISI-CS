                                                                                                               SBI deposits lose shine
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          TRIM amp; SLIM                                  
	Mumbai, March 2: The State Bank of India today slashed interest rates on some term deposits by 40-50 basis points.         
	For deposits between 181 days and less than a year, the rate is now 8.10 per cent against 8.50 per cent earlier.         
	Deposits between 2 years and less than 1,000 days will come for 8.25 per cent against 8.75 per cent.         
	A 1000-day deposit is for 8.50 per cent (9 per cent), while that between 1001 days and less than 3 years is for 8.25 per cent against 8.75 per cent earlier.        
	The new rates will be applicable from next week.        
	Earlier this year, the SBI had aggressively reduced the lending rates for homes and cars.        
	In January, it froze interest rates on new home loans at 8 per cent for a year. Last month, it brought down interest rates on cars to 10 per cent for a year. The revised rate was at least 25 basis points lower than other banks.         
	Bankers are not ruling out the possibility of the SBI reducing lending rates further. This comes at a time when expectations are rife that the Reserve Bank of India may cut key rates to spur the economy, which grew just 5.3 per cent in the third quarter.         
	Last week, Punjab National Bank reduced interest rates on deposits by 50 basis points for maturity periods of 46-90 days and 180 days to less than a year. These changes were effective from March 1. PNB also cut interest rates on car loans by 50 basis points to 10.5-11 per cent.         
	IDBI move        
	IDBI Bank also brought down interest rates on retail term deposits.         
	Deposits having 1,100-days maturity will now carry a rate of 9.25 per cent against 9.50 per cent earlier.        
	Similarly, deposits up to Rs 15 lakh with a tenure of 3 years to 10 years will now offer an interest rate of 8.25 per cent (8.75 per cent), while those above Rs 15 lakh will carry a rate of 8.5 per cent (9 per cent).        
	The bank also slashed floating interest rates on home loans by 100 basis points to 9.75 per cent for loans up to Rs 20 lakh.         
	For loans above Rs 20 lakh, the rates have been reduced by 50 basis points to 10.25 per cent.        
	Simultaneously, the margin on home loans has been reduced to 15 per cent from 20 per cent for loans up to Rs 30 lakh. For loans above Rs 30 lakh, the margin is now 20 per cent.

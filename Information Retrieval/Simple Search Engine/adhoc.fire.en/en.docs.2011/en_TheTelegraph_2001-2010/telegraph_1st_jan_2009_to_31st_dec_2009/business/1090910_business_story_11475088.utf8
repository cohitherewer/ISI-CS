The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Govt to ring in 2G spectrum auction
                                                                                                               Govt to ring in 2G spectrum auction
          JAYATI GHOSE amp; JAYANTA ROY CHOWDHURY                                            
	New Delhi, Sept. 9: The government has decided to auction second-generation (2G) spectrum rather than allocate the scarce resource based on the number of subscribers.        
	Finance ministry officials said the group of ministers on spectrum had come to the conclusion that 2G spectrum, or radiowaves, must be auctioned, as will happen in 3G.        
	Officials said auctions were the best way to arrive at the true value of spectrum. This is in contrast to the stand of telecom operators who feel auctions can raise costs.         
	The government has budgeted Rs 4-lakh-crore deficit this year and is facing the twin pressures of lower tax collection and higher government spending to counter the drought and slowdown.         
	Consequently, it wants to tap all possible avenues for resource mobilisation. It expects to collect Rs 25,000-30,000 crore from 3G auction alone from 22 telecom circles.        
	Spectrum allocation based on subscribers had hit a hurdle in 2007 when the government decided to increase the number of users to get additional spectrum.         
	At present, a telecom licence comes bundled with 4.4 MHz of GSM spectrum, which is the minimum amount required to launch mobile services.         
	Following this, operators are awarded an additional 1.8 units, subject to them meeting certain subscriber numbers.        
	There is a suggestion to treat 6.2 MHz GSM spectrum as threshold and allot spectrum beyond this (6.2 MHz) through auction. But this will amount to a change in existing guidelines and appropriate amendments will be necessary after this approach is approved in-principle, said DoT officials.        
	The finance and law ministries have repeatedly called for the auction of spectrum to both new entrants and existing operators.        
	A spectrum committee set up recently by the department of telecom (DoT) to review the policy has also recommended the auction of fresh spectrum and doing away with the subscriber-based criteria.         
	For the existing players, the report suggests auctions beyond 6.2 MHz. It says that for new players spectrum and licence should be delinked, meaning they will have to go through auctions even for start-up spectrum.        
	The telecom ministry has sought the views of telecom regulator Trai on the spectrum panels report.         
	Trai has sought time till November-end to give its recommendations.        
	Meanwhile, the DoT has put a freeze on all allocations beyond the 4.4MHz mark till the panels report is finalised.

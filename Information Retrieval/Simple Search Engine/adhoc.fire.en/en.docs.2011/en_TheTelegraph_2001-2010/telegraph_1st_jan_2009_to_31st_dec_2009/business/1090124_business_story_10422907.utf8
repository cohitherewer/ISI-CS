The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Bengal solar plant delayed
                                                                                                               Bengal solar plant delayed
          SOUNAK MITRA                              
	Calcutta, Jan. 23: The countrys first solar wafer plant in Bengal will be delayed by about two years.         
	Komex, the South Korean partner of the $400-million joint venture Kits Solar, has decided to quit. The facility was expected to start production by December 2008. Kits was incorporated with Rs 200 crore authorised capital to execute the project in Durgapur.        
	After Komexs exit, around 34 per cent stake in Kits needs to be offloaded.         
	A source told The Telegraph that Kits, which already has 4 acres, expects to start the 100 per cent export-oriented unit by December 2010.        
	The West Bengal Renewable Energy Development Agency has a 10 per cent stake in Kits, while city-based Synergy Renewable Energy (Srel) owns 30 per cent. Komex and its associates from Singapore, Taiwan and South Korea hold the rest.         
	There was a tussle be- tween Komex and other foreign entities in the consortium, which delayed the project, the source said.         
	Srel MD Amitabh Gupta said, We are in talks with companies and would like to finalise a partner in the first quarter of the next financial year. The partner could be a firm based in eastern India, he said.        
	Solar wafers are used to make solar panels which generate electricity from sunlight.

          SRIKUMAR BONDYOPADHYAY                                                        
	Calcutta, June 2: Mutual funds managed assets worth Rs 6,00,000 crore in May  the highest ever so far.         
	The previous highest average AUM (assets under management) was recorded at Rs 5,99,417.35 crore in the same month last year.        
	According to data released by the Association of Mutual Funds in India (Amfi), the average AUM of mutual funds for May stood at Rs 6,39,130.20 crore, up 15.94 per cent from the previous month (Rs 5,51,254.22 crore).         
	The surge in MFs assets under management in May came on the back of unprecedented gains in equity prices after March. The 30-share sensex gained 50.64 per cent in the last two months. The gain was 28.25 per cent in May alone.        
	The equity schemes of mutual funds recorded hefty gains, fuelling the growth in assets under management.         
	According to Value Research, a firm that tracks the mutual fund industry in the country, diversified equity plans clocked an average return of 30.65 per cent for the month  the best monthly return since March 1992.         
	Thirty-five fund houses cumulatively added assets worth Rs 87,300 crore last month. Reliance Mutual Fund, the largest fund house, crossed the Rs 1,00,000-crore-mark in AUM by adding Rs 14,350 crore assets during the month.         
	The top 10 fund houses added Rs 67,700 crore to their AUM. The second-largest fund house, HDFC MF, gained Rs 11,525.47 crore in its AUM at Rs 75,406.10 crore.        
	ICICI Prudential and UTI MF added Rs 9,500.58 crore and Rs 8,947.88 crore, respectively, to their assets last month.         
	The market has gone up substantially and investors are again showing interest in equity schemes. With increased inflows, the subscription is also increasing, Sahara Mutual Fund CEO Naresh Garg said.        
	The average AUM of mutual funds was lower when equity prices were at their peaks early last year. This proves that investors in equity schemes didnt rush to take their money out and stayed invested when stock prices crashed afterwards. In fact, there has been a steady flow of funds and investors in equity schemes, said a fund manager with a private sector mutual fund, which filed a prospectus for an equity plan with the market regulator last month.         
	In fact, taking a cue from the improved sentiments of investors, many mutual funds have decided to come up with new schemes.        
	However, according to Value research, many mutual funds are still sitting on a pile of cash as large as 16 per cent of their AUMs, which means they are not investing in equities to a large extent.        
	The growth in AUM came about primarily because of the increase in the value of MFs earlier holdings of equities, said an analyst with a brokerage firm. The mutual fund industrys assets under management grew Rs 1,38,247.89 crore, or 27.60 per cent, in the last three months.

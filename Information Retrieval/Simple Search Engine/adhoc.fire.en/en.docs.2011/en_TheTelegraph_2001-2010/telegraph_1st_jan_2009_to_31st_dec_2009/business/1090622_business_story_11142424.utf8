          OUR CORRESPONDENT                                         
	New Delhi, June 21: Its not enough to own a mobile; you should know to use it in public.         
	The department of telecom (DoT) has asked handset manufacturers and service providers to provide guidelines on cellphone etiquette.         
	Sample some of its suggestions: if the background noise is disturbing, go to a quieter place with your phone.         
	If there is a bad connection, talking louder will not help; just end the call and try again from a place where the reception is better.        
	These are standard rules, but for the first time, the government has stepped in to list them in the form of a directive to firms.        
	The dos and donts provide common courtesies to use the handset in a responsible manner, having due consideration and respect for the feelings of other individuals, the DoT directive says.         
	According to the directive, phones should be switched off or kept in a silent mode in places such as cinema halls, hospitals, aircraft, buses, trains and places of worship.        
	Mobiles should not be used while driving. The directive mentions that traffic rules call for penalty on those making calls while driving.         
	It is a drive in the interest of the general public. While people do know how to use mobile phones, sometimes loud ringtones or conversations create a nuisance in public. We are just trying to create an awareness, said DoT officials.        
	In the directive, the DoT has put the onus on telecom companies: In the interest of the public and for the proper conduct of telegraph services, the licensor with immediate effect makes it obligatory on the part of all to create awareness for proper usage of mobile phones and ensure supply of literature in English and regional languages prescribing mobile etiquette wherever a customer buys a mobile handset and a SIM card.         
	The directive says cellphones should not be used to click photographs of people without consent, and ringtones should be set at a lower level.         
	Use of annoying ringtones such as kids crying or horns blaring should be avoided, said DoT officials.         
	In public places, mobile phone users should be considerate towards people sitting next to them and not have loud discussions about private issues, they said.         
	Beena George, senior executive with McCann Erikson, said, Issuing directives is a step in the right direction. However, despite being fined for using a cellphone while driving, people still do that. Ultimately, it is the handset users who have to learn to be responsible.         
	There are 415 million mobile phone users in the country, and millions who are first-time users.         
	Hence, the department feels there is a need to educate them on etiquette.         
	The fast growing domestic telecom sector added 11.59 million subscribers in May compared with 11.90 million in April, according to data released by the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India.         
	The teledensity  the number of people using phones per 100 of the population  has reached 38.88 at the end of May against 37.94 in April.

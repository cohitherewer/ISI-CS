The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Dr Reddys eyes prime position in US generics
                                                                                                               Dr Reddys eyes prime position in US generics
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Growth pill                                  
	Mumbai, May 31: Hyderabad-based Dr Reddys Laboratories Ltd aims to be among the top five generic companies in the US by 2013, banking on an array of new drugs for which it is seeking permissions from American authorities.        
	Teva, Mylan, Sandoz and Watson are the four largest generic companies in the US; Dr Reddys, with a market share of just over two per cent, is on a lower rung competing with Indian players such as Ranbaxy Laboratories and Lupin.        
	In the last fiscal, Dr Reddys launched 16 products and filed 20 abbreviated new drug applications (ANDAs), which took its filings to 144.        
	It has 68 ANDAs pending approval, including 38 para IV filings of which 18 are potential first to files (FTFs). Brokerages such as Angel Broking expect their market size to be around $9 billion. It is expected that Dr Reddys can be bestowed with at least one FTF, or a niche launch, every year for five years.        
	ANDA is an application to launch a generic drug in the US.        
	A para IV filing by a company, which is lucrative but risky, challenges a patented drug by claiming its product does not infringe on the patented drug.        
	A generic firm, which is the first to file a para IV application, is granted 180-days exclusivity if it successfully defends its application.        
	In a recent presentation to analysts, Dr Reddys said the drugs for which it would move the US authorities would enable it to achieve the objective of being among the top five generic firms in the US.        
	Analysts are upbeat on the company. Many brokerages have a buy or outperform rating on the stock. In a recent report, Macquarie Research has highlighted Dr Reddys as its top picks in the Indian pharmaceutical space. Because the global generic business now approaches critical mass in all major geographies, operating leverage should help margins to expand, its analysts said in a recent note.        
	Observers are also upbeat on certain upsides in the companys business. In 2008-09, one such upside came from the launch of sumatriptan, the generic version of GlaxoSmithKlines Imitrex used for the treatment of migraine. It saw higher-than-expected sales of Rs 360 crore in the March quarter.        
	The next such upside is seen in omeprazole, a generic form of Astra Zenecas Prilosec, used in the treatment of heart diseases. It may be recalled that in February, a US district judge gave a judgment in favour of Dr Reddys that its product did not infringe upon Astra Zenecas patents.

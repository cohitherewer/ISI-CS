          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, May 4: Satyam founder B. Ramalinga Raju manipulated accounts to make the company look good and let the promoters sell their shares at huge premiums, the Serious Frauds Investigation Office said.        
	Between April 2000, when software companies made a fortune from the Y2K solution business, and January 2009, Raju and his relatives sold almost 3.9 crore shares and pocketed Rs 3,029.67 crore, the agency said in its report to the government.        
	During this period, Raju sold 98 lakh shares, raking in Rs 773.42 crore, while his brother and former managing director Rama Raju sold 1.1 crore shares for Rs 894.32 crore, said the SFIO.         
	Satyam promoters spent huge amounts on brand building and inflated the books with fictitious profit and non-existent debtors. This pushed up share prices and misled the investors and shareholders regarding the companys worth.        
	The idea was to offload promoter shareholding at frequent intervals at highly-manipulated prices, said officials. The manipulations were done to maintain competitive financial ratios vis--vis rivals. Investigators said part of the money had been used to buy land, while investment in offshore funds was also a possibility.        
	To meet the expectations of investors, they (Satyam) made major acquisitions from time to time which ultimately proved to be a losing proposition, the report said.        
	By falsifying the accounts for several years and through reckless spending just to project the company as cash-rich, the promoters have brought the infotech major to a state of bankruptcy.        
	The SFIO said the company had issued bonus shares to boost sentiment.

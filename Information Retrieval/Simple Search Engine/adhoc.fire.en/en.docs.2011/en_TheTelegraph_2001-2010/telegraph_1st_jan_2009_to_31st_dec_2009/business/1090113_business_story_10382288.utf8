	New Delhi, Jan. 12: Industrial production grew 2.4 per cent in November, after contracting in October.        
	Analysts said the Reserve Bank of India in its monetary policy later this month was likely to ease the key interest rates as the sentiment was expected to remain weak in the remaining period of this financial year.         
	The global slowdown has impacted several sectors, including automobiles, textiles, real estate and exports.        
	In November 2007, the index of industrial production (IIP) grew 4.9 per cent.         
	Growth in October was revised to 0.3 per cent from 0.4 per cent, while for the eight months till November growth was 3.9 per cent compared with 9.2 per cent a year ago.         
	Manufacturing grew 2.4 per cent in November against a decline of 1.1 per cent in October.         
	Economists said the strikes of the truckers and oil PSU workers would hit production.        
	Suresh Tendulkar, the chairman of the economic advisory council to the Prime Minister, said, The numbers are above my expectations and in the coming days, I expect (them) to improve.        
	Infrastructure grew 2.2 per cent in November against 5.1 per cent a year ago.        
	Growth in October for infrastructure was 3.4 per cent. The six industries in infrastructure have more than a 25 per cent weight in IIP.         
	From April to November, infrastructure registered a growth rate of 3.6 per cent against 6.4 per cent in the corresponding period of the previous year.

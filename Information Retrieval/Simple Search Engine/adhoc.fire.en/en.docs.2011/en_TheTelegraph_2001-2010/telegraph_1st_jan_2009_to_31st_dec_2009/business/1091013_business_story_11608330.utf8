          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Calcutta, Oct. 12: Tata Steels Chhattisgarh project today got the approval of the villagers in the Lohandiguda block of Bastar district.        
	The public hearing, attended by around 500 villagers, was organised by district magistrate M.S. Paraste to seek their approval on environmental issues. It (the hearing) went off well. Villagers have given consent to the Tata proposal, Paraste told The Telegraph from Lohandiguda. The state administration will now send the results of the public hearing to the Centre for its environmental clearance.         
	Tata Steel plans to build a 5.7-million-tonne plant in Chhattisgarh at a cost of Rs 19,500 crore. The company had signed a memorandum of understanding with the Chhattisgarh government in June 2005 but delay in land acquisition put brakes on the project. Maoist insurgencies made matters worse.         
	The Tatas have sought 5,050 acres for the project. The state is acquiring the land for the company. Paraste said the government had given compensation to 80 per cent of the people but was yet to take possession of the land.

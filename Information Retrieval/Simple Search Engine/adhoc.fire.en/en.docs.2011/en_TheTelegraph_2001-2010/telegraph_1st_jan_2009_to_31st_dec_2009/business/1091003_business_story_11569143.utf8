	New Delhi, Oct. 2: Global conglomerate GE today said its healthcare units in India would be merged into its joint venture with IT major Wipro to drive growth.         
	In five years, 50-75 per cent of GE Healthcare products will be made in India, GE chief executive officer Jeffrey Immelt said.         
	The US-based firm targets a revenue of $6 billion from the healthcare business in the country in three to four years.        
	He said the focus was on the simplification of healthcare business against the backdrop of increased exports. Post-integration, the joint venture firm will have 1,200 employees.         
	We want to accelerate growth in India. The healthcare market here is poised for substantial growth, not just in places such as Delhi, but throughout the country. We think this is an exceptionally good time to invest here, Immelt said at a conference where Wipro chairman Azim Premji was also present.        
	Wipro GE Healthcare has been selling products in the country since 1990. GE holds 51 per cent in the venture, which accounts for about 85 per cent of GE Healthcares sales in the country.         
	The units to be merged into the joint venture are GE Healthcare Life Sciences, GE Healthcare Medical Diagnostics and GE Medical Systems India.        
	GE plans to ramp up production in India to 50-75 per cent in five to 10 years from the present 25 per cent.         
	The strategic move is aimed at effective management and optimal utilisation of resources to help accelerate growth in regions where demand for healthcare is growing, GE Healthcare CEO John Dineen said.

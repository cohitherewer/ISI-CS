The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | MF exit load cap to help retail investors
                                                                                                               MF exit load cap to help retail investors
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Calcutta, July 1: Long-term investors in mutual funds have a reason to cheer. A recent Sebi rule tweak on exit loads will indirectly reward them from August. The exit load is a concern for short-term investors, mostly institutions, who hardly stay invested for a year. Those staying longer  mostly retail investors  dont have to pay an exit load when they sell their units.         
	Mutual fund houses would earlier set aside the exit load collected in a separate fund to pay for expenses. A surplus, if any, would go back to the fund at the discretion of the fund house.         
	However, mutual funds can now set aside only 1 per cent of the exit load charged (say 4 per cent) by them in a separate account to pay commissions to the distributor and other marketing expenses. The remaining amount (3 per cent) has to be credited immediately to the scheme corpus. As a result, a scheme will have more assets at its disposal  something long-term investors would appreciate.         
	According to Sanjay Sinha, chief executive of DBS Cholamandalam, fund houses may not cap their exit loads at 1 per cent as these are imposed to control churning, too.         
	The Sebi circular only states that any amount above 1 per cent exit load shall be immediately credited to the asset value of the scheme and this will certainly benefit long-term investors, he said.        
	Sinha also ruled out that mutual funds would impose a 1 per cent exit load irrespective of when investors sold their units. A flat 1 per cent exit load irrespective of investment tenure would induce churning, Sinha said.         
	Under the new norms, the fund houses wont collect any entry load either. Investors will pay the commission directly to the distributors or agents from August. Investors will have to negotiate the commission with their agents based on the services they provide. If the agents offer sound financial advice, investors may be ready to pay them a larger commission than the one who just delivers forms and collects cheques.         
	The application form will carry a disclosure on the upfront commission paid to distributors by the investor based on the service rendered by the distributor, the Sebi circular said.

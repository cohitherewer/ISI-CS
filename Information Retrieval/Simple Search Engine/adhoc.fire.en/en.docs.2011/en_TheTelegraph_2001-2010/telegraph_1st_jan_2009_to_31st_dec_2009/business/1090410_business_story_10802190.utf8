          OUR CORRESPONDENT                          Growth mode                                  
	New Delhi, April 9: Sistema Shyam Teleservices has grabbed half a million subscribers within six months of rolling out services, gaining an edge over the other new entrants in the telecom space.         
	Sistema Shyam  a joint venture between Sistema Group of Russia and Calcutta-based Shyam Group  is the only company to roll out services in the first year of getting a licence.         
	Datacom (owned by the Dhoots of Videocon and Mahendra Nahata of Himachal Futuristics), Swan Telecom, Loop Telecom (a subsidiary of Loop Mobile, formerly known as BPL Mobile Communications), S Tel, Unitech Wireless and Shyam Telelink were given licences in January 2008 for pan-India services.         
	None of the other new entrants has commenced operations. The department of telecom has threatened action against them if they do not roll out services by the middle of the year.        
	At present, Sistema Shyam provides CDMA services in over 600 towns of Rajasthan, 373 towns of Tamil Nadu and 117 towns of Kerala.         
	The company is also set to debut in Bengal and the northeast in the next two months. Last month, Alok Tandon, managing director of the firm, had said the company could be listed on the bourses within a year.         
	Russias largest private conglomerate Sistema, which holds 74 per cent in Shyam Telelink, plans to spend Rs 27,500 crore over the next four years to expand its subscriber base and build new telecom infrastructure.        
	Our acquisition of the first 500,000 subscribers is an important stepping stone in our ambition to become a pan-India telecom operator that is poised to provide high quality network and global levels of customer service quality in this country, said Vsevolod Rozanov, president and CEO of Sistema Shyam Teleservices.        
	The company expects to become a pan-India player in the next 15-18 months by covering all the 22 circles of the country.

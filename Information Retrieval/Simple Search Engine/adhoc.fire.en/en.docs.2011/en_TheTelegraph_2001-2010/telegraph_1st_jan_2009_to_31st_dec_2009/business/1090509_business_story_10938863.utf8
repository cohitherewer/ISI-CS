The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | SBI bets on money transfer 
                                                                                                               SBI bets on money transfer 
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                            
	Calcutta, April 8: Recession or not, Indians abroad are sending more money home.         
	Inward remittance, the transfer of money from abroad to recipients here, has grown 28 per cent during April-December 2008 over the same period a year ago.         
	The State Bank of India sees this as an opportunity to increase its fee-income.        
	Last October, the SBI had recorded a 56 per cent jump in remittance. During the same month, the bank opened its centralised processing cell in Calcutta to handle all retail remittance through SWIFT (Society for Worldwide Interbrain Financial Telecommunication).         
	SWIFT is a computer-based standardised message writing system that banks use to exchange payment-related information.         
	SBI chairman . P. Bhatt, who formally launched the cell today, said, The bank handles inward remittance worth $7 billion. Last year, $45 billion was remitted to India by NRIs and Indians working abroad.        
	Bhatt said India had a big share in the $300bn global remittance market. We want to increase our share to 50 per cent. At present, 25 per cent of the total inbound remittance is routed through the SBI and its associate banks, he said.         
	Following the setting up of the centralised cell, all (retail) remittance messages will be received at the city office and the money credited to the beneficiarys account within 24 hours.         
	Earlier, it would take anything between three and five days. Now that all branches of the SBI are on CBS (core banking solution) platform, it wont take more than 24 hours, a senior SBI official said.        
	Besides, the Inward Remittance Cell (IRC) can receive money for a beneficiary who is not an SBI customer. In this case, the money is credited to the beneficiarys bank through a payment gateway. In fact, we have done this for Federal Bank, the official said.        
	The SBI has 11,448 branches across the country. For remittance, the bank has tie-ups for 1,626 SWIFT arrangements with 678 banks in 124 countries and agency arrangements with 237 banks.         
	Thus, anyone from anywhere in the world can send money to their relatives in the remotest part of India, said S. K. Bhattacharyya, managing director of the SBI.         
	This facility will help us increase the banks low-cost deposit base because more people who have relatives abroad will open an account with the SBI, he added.        
	The IRC handles about 900 transfers a day and we are planning to increase it to 2,000, said K. Ramachandran, general manager, global markets unit (Calcutta).         
	Between January and April this year, we handled remittance worth Rs 155 crore. In April alone, we had done a business of Rs 56 crore, he said.         
	The SBI charges Rs 25 per transaction irrespective of the amount of money remitted.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | L amp;T to sell UltraTech stake
                                                                                                               L amp;T to sell UltraTech stake
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                            
	Mumbai, June 10: Larsen amp; Toubro, the Rs 34,045-crore engineering and construction giant, is looking to sell a substantial part of its 11.49 per cent stake in UltraTech Cement Ltd.        
	Sources said L amp;T could sell at least 8 per cent in the cement company for around Rs 720 crore.        
	UltraTech was originally the cement division of L amp;T before the Aditya Birla group acquired a controlling interest in 2003.        
	Under the terms of the buyout, L amp;T must sell its stake by the end of this year. The Birlas have the right of first refusal on any stake sale by Larsen amp; Toubro.        
	Sources said the engineering and construction major could sell a substantial part of its holding in UltraTech to financial investors.         
	The transactions could be done through block deals.         
	The UltraTech share closed today at Rs 763.15, a gain of 4.7 per cent over Tuesdays close of Rs 729.20. It is believed that L amp;T may sell the stake at a discount to the closing price.         
	The buzz is that the stake sale can take place at a price between Rs 725 and Rs 735 per share.        
	L amp;T holds 14,303,294 shares, or 11.49 per cent, of UltraTechs equity.         
	At todays closing price, the value of L amp;Ts holding in UltraTech is estimated at Rs 1,091 crore.        
	The Birlas are unlikely to buy a large chunk of these shares since they already hold a 54.78 per cent stake in the cement maker.        
	Under the regulations framed by the Securities and Exchange Board of India, a promoters will have to come out with an open offer to minority shareholders if their stake rises above 55 per cent.        
	It is believed that the Birlas are not keen on making an open offer and may decide not to buy the L amp;T stake.        
	Moreover, L amp;T is not classified as one of the promoters. If it had been listed as one, the Birlas could have ducked the open offer rule since it would have been classified as an inter se transfer among the promoters.        
	If the AV Birla group buys the share, they will see that the promoters stake does not touch 55 per cent, sources said.        
	Sources said Larsen amp; Toubro had appointed Citigroup as the bookrunner for the deal.         
	The idea is to minimise the impact on the UltraTech stock. A market sale involving such a large amount of shares could dramatically impact the stock price, said a source who did not want to be identified.        
	An L amp;T official said the company had to sell its stake within a stipulated timeframe. Cement is not a strategic fit for us, he said without confirming whether L amp;T had initiated the process to sell the stake in UltraTech.        
	Market circles say if the deals are concluded tomorrow, they will rank among the largest block deals at a single counter in recent times.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Nath WTO threat to Obama
                                                                                                               Nath WTO threat to Obama
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                            
	New Delhi, Feb. 26: India today said it would try to ascertain whether US President Barack Obamas moves against job outsourcing violated the rules of the World Trade Organization (WTO).        
	We will definitely take it up with the US. We have to see whether it is WTO compliant. We have to also see how the companies in the US react to this move, if and when it is legislated, commerce minister Kamal Nath said today.        
	In his first speech at a joint session of Congress yesterday, Obama had said that American firms shipping jobs overseas would no longer get tax breaks.        
	The move will hurt Indias BPO sector as US companies may find it less attractive to outsource jobs in the absence of the breaks.        
	According to R.S. Gujral, the director-general of foreign trade, the latest US stand on outsourcing may impact Indias service sector exports.        
	The countrys service sector export was at $88 billion in fiscal 2008 with software contributing $40.3 billion.         
	There has been growth in the service sector, but if there is a policy in the US to restrict it (outsourcing), it will have an impact, Gujral said.        
	The sector has fared better than merchandise exports and is expected to improve upon last fiscals performance. Merchandise exports in January declined 16 per cent and the numbers are unlikely to be better in February and March.        
	Policy pill  
	The government today offered fresh succour to exporters by speeding up refunds and easing curbs on raw material imports.         
	It also announced a Rs 325-crore package for the leather and textile sectors that have seen the maximum erosion in business and job losses.        
	In the interim foreign trade policy unveiled today, commerce and industry minister Kamal Nath scaled down the export target to $175 billion for this fiscal from $200 billion. For 2009-10, the target has been set at $200 billion.        
	Other measures include the removal of import curbs on gems and jewellery, relaxation in export obligations and a 5 per cent duty credit for the export of handmade carpet under the focus product scheme against 3.5 per cent given earlier.        
	According to Assocham president Sajjan Jindal, the target of $175 billion was ambitious in view of the weak demand in the US, Europe and even Asean.        
	A. Sakthivel, president of the Federation of Indian Export Organisations, reacted positively to the support given to the gems and jewellery and textile sectors but said garment exports to the US and Europe needed be included under the special focus schemes.

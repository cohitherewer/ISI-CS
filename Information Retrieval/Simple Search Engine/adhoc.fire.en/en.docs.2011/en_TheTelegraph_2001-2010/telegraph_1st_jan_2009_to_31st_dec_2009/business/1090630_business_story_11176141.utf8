The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Biocon seals deal with Mylan for niche drugs
                                                                                                               Biocon seals deal with Mylan for niche drugs
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT      
	Mumbai, June 29: Biocon  the Rs 1,673-crore Bangalore-based biotech firm  has signed an agreement with US-based Mylan to develop, manufacture and market generic biologic drugs.        
	Biologic drugs are made from living organisms such as human proteins and are used in the prevention or treatment of ailments such as cancer. Pharmaceuticals are made from chemical compounds.         
	As part of the collaboration, both the companies will share development, capital and certain costs to bring products to the market.        
	Mylan, the third largest global generics pharmaceutical company with revenues of $5 billion, will have exclusive marketing rights in the US, Canada, Japan, Australia, New Zealand and in the European Union and European Free Trade Association countries through a profit-sharing agreement with Biocon.        
	Mylan will also have co-exclusive marketing rights with Biocon in other markets. Biocon did not disclose financial terms of the deal or the specific therapeutic areas that the alliance would focus on.        
	Biocon said the generics segment in the pharmaceutical industry, which is based almost entirely on chemically synthesised drugs, is poised for a change. The pressure to lower health costs has led to governments facilitating the entry of generic biotech or protein-derived drugs.        
	Biocon expects the agreement will be a win-win deal since it has strong capabilities in research, development and manufacture of biologics, while Mylan has regulatory and marketing capabilities. This is expected to create a cost effective model to tap into the huge potential available for generic biologics.        
	Through this partnership, we hope to deliver high quality, affordable, biologics, thereby addressing a critical need to lower spiralling healthcare costs in both the developed and developing economies, said Biocon chairman Kiran Mazumdar-Shaw.

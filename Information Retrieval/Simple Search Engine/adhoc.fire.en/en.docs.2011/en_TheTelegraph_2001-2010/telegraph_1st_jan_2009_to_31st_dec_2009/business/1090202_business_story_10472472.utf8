The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Kingfisher plunges deeper into red
                                                                                                               Kingfisher plunges deeper into red
                                        Mallaya:Hard Times      
	Mumbai, Feb. 1 (PTI): Kingfisher Airlines has reported a net loss of Rs 626 crore during the third quarter ended December 31 against a loss of Rs 423 crore a year ago.        
	The increase in loss during the quarter was on account of costs involved in starting international operations (Rs 174 crore) and the exchange rate impact of dollar-denominated expenses (Rs 60 crore), the company said in a statement.        
	The Vijay-Mallya-led airline also suffered because of interest expenses  which increased by Rs 103 crore during the quarter  and operating costs, which included provisions for contingencies for return of aircraft worth Rs 30 crore.         
	Net income during the reporting period was Rs 1,447 crore compared with Rs 1,353 crore in the corresponding quarter of the previous year.         
	Last week, Kingfisher said it had taken up the issue of payment of interest on outstanding dues and bank guarantee, as demanded by the oil marketing companies, with the government.        
	We have received a letter from the oil marketing companies asking for the payment of interest on outstanding dues and bank guarantee. However, since such a condition was not put across in the last meeting, we are taking up the issue with the government, a Kingfisher Airlines statement said.        
	State-run oil firms had earlier allegedly threatened the private carrier that its aircraft would not be allowed to be fuelled unless it paid interest on its outstanding dues and bank guarantee.        
	The government had facilitated a joint meeting of all the stakeholders  oil marketing firms and airline operators  with the ministers of civil aviation and petroleum and natural gas on October 22.         
	The minutes of the proceedings suggest that these two points (payment of interest on outstanding dues and bank guarantee) did not come up for discussions at all, the statement said.        
	We have therefore taken up the matter with the government, it said, adding that the carrier will fully abide by any directions given by the government.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Govt changes stand on Ambani gas row
                                                                                                               Govt changes stand on Ambani gas row
          OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Sept. 1: The government today withdrew its earlier demand that the entire Ambani family settlement over the sharing of gas in the KG-D6 basin be declared null and void and instead confined its legal challenge in the Supreme Court to that portion of the MoU which relates to its gas utilisation policy.         
	The Union of India would wish to unequivocally clarify it was not seeking any relief from this court to set at naught any family arrangement or MoU entered into between the parties, a fresh interlocutory application, filed on behalf of the government, said.         
	The government claimed its interests were prejudiced by the Bombay High Court judgment that had reduced it to a position where it had lost control in approval of price of natural gas and regulating price of natural resource, namely gas, of which it is the owner.         
	The judgment has seriously impaired the allocation and utilisation policy of the government in terms of which it prioritises gas supply to various sectors and allows a private arrangement to supercede the production sharing contract and governments policies seriously having an impact on public and national interest, the application said.         
	The government submitted there was a larger public interest involved in the matter.         
	It claimed that as the country was a gas-deficit one, it was exploring the possibility of inviting mega investments and technology for the purpose of exploiting the countrys hydro-carbon resources.         
	The Unions ability to make our country a competitive and attractive destination for these mega investments is contingent on implementation, enforcement of a transparent and predictable policy regime, it said.

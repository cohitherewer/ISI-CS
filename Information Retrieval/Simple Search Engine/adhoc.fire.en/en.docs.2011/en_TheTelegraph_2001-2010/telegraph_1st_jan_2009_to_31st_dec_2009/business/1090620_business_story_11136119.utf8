          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Chain reaction                                  
	New Delhi, June 19: Air India today asked its top managers to forego salary for the month of July to help the ailing national carrier ride out a severe cash crunch.        
	In a letter to general managers and directors, Air India chairman Arvind Jadhav said the top management needs to indicate to all employees in the organisation that every single paisa which can be saved needs to be saved.        
	The missive comes a week after the staff were told that the payment of their June salaries would be delayed, prompting a strike threat by 20,000 employees, more than two-thirds of Air Indias workforce.         
	This is the first time that any state-owned organisation is asking its top managers to voluntarily give up a months salary to help it overcome a crisis. A combination of high fuel prices, fewer passengers and the global financial meltdown have left the airline with an estimated loss of Rs 4,300 crore in 2008-09, a 93 per cent increase over the Rs 2,226-crore loss recorded in the year before. The domestic airline industry is estimated to have run up losses of about Rs 10,000 crore.        
	However, Jadhavs letter, which was released by the airline today, was seen as an attempt to placate angry junior staff over the payment delays and also draw the governments attention to the plight of the airline which has steadily lost its market share.        
	The state-run carrier has been seeking a bailout of around Rs 4,000 crore from the government for some time now. It wants around Rs 2,750 crore in soft loans or grants and the rest as an equity contribution from the government to recapitalise the airline. Airline officials say the soft loans are being sought to offset the costs of merging the larger Indian Airlines with Air India.         
	Air India has also pointed out that national carriers around the world have been getting similar bailouts. The Development Bank of Japan is considering Japan Airlines plea for 200 billion yen, or roughly a $2-billion loan, on easy terms. Air China has asked for a three-billion-yuan or a $439-million state help. The Obama administration is also evaluating bailout pleas from loss-making US airlines and airports.        
	Air India, on its part, is seeking a capital infusion to raise its capital base so that it can leverage the loans it needs to finance its Rs 44,000-crore fleet acquisition programme.         
	However, with the airline operating at less than half its capacity on many routes, various wings of the government have been advising it to delay its fleet acquisition programme so that it heads off the prospect of fresh losses.        
	The government is likely to make this a condition before clearing any equity infusion or bailout package, officials said. Private airlines such as Kingfisher and Jet Airways have slashed their capacities by 20 per cent and 30 per cent, respectively, in an effort to cope with the tough environment.

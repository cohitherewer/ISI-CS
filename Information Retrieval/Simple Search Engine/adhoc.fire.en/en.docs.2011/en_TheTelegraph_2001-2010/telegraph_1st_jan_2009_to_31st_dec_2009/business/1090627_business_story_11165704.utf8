The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Two more on SBI merger list
                                                                                                               Two more on SBI merger list

	New Delhi, June 26: Two more associate banks will be combined with the State Bank of India once the State Bank of Indore is merged with the parent. The two entities that the government plans to merge with the SBI are the State Bank of Hyderabad and the State Bank of Patiala.        
	Finance ministry sources say the government wants to merge these unlisted banks with the SBI, allowing the listed subsidiaries  the State Bank of Bikaner amp; Jaipur, the State Bank of Travancore and the State Bank of Mysore  to remain independent for the time being.        
	A cabinet note to merge the State Bank of Indore will come up soon after we have worked out the swap ratio for shares, said officials. The other two banks will also be merged with the SBI in this financial year.         
	The SBI, which has already merged the State Bank of Saurashtra with itself, will increase its market share from 20 per cent to about 25 per cent once the merger of these three unlisted banks are over. The actual process of merger could start as early as September.         
	The State Bank of Indore is the smallest bank in terms of capital, reserves, deposits and borrowings at Rs 33,075 crore and is first on the merger list.         
	The State Bank of Hyderabad has about Rs 76,721 crore, while the State Bank of Patiala has about Rs 59,060 crore.         
	Since these banks are largely localised, the merger is expected to strengthen the SBIs presence in central India, south India and Punjab.        
	The countrys largest lender needs to increase its size as India gears up to open up banking to foreign entities in a bigger way within the next few years.         
	However, if all the subsidiaries are merged with the SBI, it will create a huge behemoth and lead to diseconomies of scale. Merging unlisted subsidiaries is seen as an easier way out.         
	Officials say the SBI has taken steps towards an eventual merger. It has already integrated its technology platform with the associate banks.        
	The bank has put in place a common IT and ATM network and accounting system, which will enable a smooth transition once the associate banks are merged with the SBI.        
	Meanwhile, six unions of the SBI and its associates have given a strike call on July 6 to protest the merger of the State Bank of Indore and other associate banks with the SBI.

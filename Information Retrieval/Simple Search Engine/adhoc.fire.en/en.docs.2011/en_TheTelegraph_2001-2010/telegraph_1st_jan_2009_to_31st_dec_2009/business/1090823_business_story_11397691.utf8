The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | States rule out cut in jet fuel tax
                                                                                                               States rule out cut in jet fuel tax
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                                Dasgupta: Firm stand      
	New Delhi, Aug. 22: States today rejected the demand of loss-ridden airlines to lower jet fuel tax.         
	In a meeting today, an empowered group of state finance ministers decided against reducing tax on aviation turbine fuel as the petroleum ministry was yet to explain how jet fuel prices were fixed and whether there was any scope for lower rates.        
	Bengal finance minister and VAT panel chairman Asim Dasgupta said, We had asked the petroleum ministry for data explaining the pricing policy in June. They are yet to come up with it. The states feel they cant take a decision in vacuum.        
	The state ministers also rejected the central governments suggestion that jet fuel be classified as a declared good and be taxed at a minimal 4 per cent to ease the burden on airlines. This comes around 10 days after the central government had set up a panel to study the problems faced by the aviation industry.        
	The Federation of Indian Airlines has been seeking a cut in jet fuel taxes to 4 per cent from an average rate of 26 per cent across the country. Jet fuel accounts for 35-40 per cent of the operational cost of airlines and a tax cut could help bring many out of the red. The industry is believed to have suffered losses worth Rs 10,000 crore last year.        
	The FIA had even threatened a strike but had to call it off after a warning from the central government.         
	A declared goods status for jet fuel has long been on demand. The move could help reduce value-added tax on ATF from as high as 29 per cent in some states to around 4 per cent.         
	Sales tax on ATF is the lowest in Andhra Pradesh at 4 per cent, while it is the highest in Tamil Nadu and Bihar at 29 per cent. In Bengal, the ATF charge is 25 per cent.        
	At present, items such as paddy, rice and other foodgrains, coal, cotton, iron, steel and LPG are on the declared goods list as these are important for inter-state trade.        
	The meeting of the state finance ministers also tried to iron out differences over the introduction of goods and services tax (GST) which is expected to reduce prices of essential goods.        
	The overall burden of GST on the prices of essential commodities will fall. We want this to fall particularly in the case of essential goods, Dasgupta said.        
	Only a very few states will be losing, many states will be gaining in a very significant manner. The government will also gain if revenue neutral rates are properly worked out, he added.        
	Sources said Tamil Nadu had earlier objected to the GST regime but later agreed to abide by joint decisions of the panel and the state.         
	Dasgupta and other members of the empowered committee may visit Chennai to further ease out the differences and take on board Tamil Nadus reservations.        
	When asked if GST will be introduced as scheduled on April 1, 2010, Dasgupta said, Our intention is that.        
	It was also decided in the meeting that goods of local importance such as puffed rice or local brew, which did not affect inter-state commerce, would not be taxed.         
	Similarly, there will be no levy on micro service providers and goods manufacturers.         
	Such taxes are difficult to raise and hurt poor people. We have accordingly to have this exempt category, said Dasgupta.        
	A debate is still on within the panel on adopting either a single unified GST rate or to make it a two-level tax where the premium items will face a higher levy, he added.

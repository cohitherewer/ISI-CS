          JAYATI GHOSE                          Growth focus                                  
	New Delhi, July 5: Mumbai-based knowledge process outsourcing (KPO) firm Integreon is planning to acquire firms involved in business research and legal outsourcing.        
	We are in talks with a few small and medium companies in the KPO, business research and legal outsourcing areas with a turnover of Rs 50-100 crore and will be taking a decision soon, Lokendra Tomar, chief operating officer (Apac region) of Integreon, told The Telegraph.        
	Integreon provides a range of outsourced knowledge, legal and administrative support services  both onshore and offshore  to global law firms, investment banks and private equity firms.         
	In May this year, Integreon acquired the e-Discovery services unit of US-based ONSITE3, creating a Rs 188-crore division for the company. ONSITE3 specialises in electronic evidence solutions for law firms and corporations.        
	There are always 4-5 merger options available in the outsourcing market. Depending on due diligence and strategic fit, a decision will be taken, said Tomar.        
	Integreon, which clocked a revenue of Rs 164.5 crore last calender year, is targeting a turnaround of Rs 376 crore by the end of calender year 2009-10.        
	The acquisition of e-Discovery will contribute to our revenues. We have also recently signed a Rs 352.5-crore contract with a legal firm, which is the largest deal by KPO/LPO standards, said Tomar. At present, legal process outsourcing segment contributes to nearly half of the total revenues.        
	Integreon, which has over 2,000 employees serving over 100 leading law firms, investment banks, and corporations, globally, does not plan to increase its headcount. It plans to focus on technology-enabled solutions to increase employee productivity. In the Mumbai and Delhi centres, it has 1,000-1,200 employees.

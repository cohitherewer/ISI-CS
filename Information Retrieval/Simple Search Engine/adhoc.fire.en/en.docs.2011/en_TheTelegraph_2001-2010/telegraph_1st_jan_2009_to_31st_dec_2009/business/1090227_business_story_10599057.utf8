	Calcutta, Feb. 26: Tata Consultancy Services, the countrys No. 1 software exporter, today said there would be no salary hikes in 2009-10.  
	Job cuts are also possible if the global economic situation worsens, TCS chief executive officer and managing director S. Ramadorai said here today.        
	He said the company had already frozen lateral intake for the year, and some employees might even be asked to leave if they could not improve their productivity. Lateral intake relates to experienced people joining the company.        
	The variable pay, which ranges between 22 per cent and 35 per cent of an employees gross salary, may also fall.         
	We are reviewing the matter, vice-president and head (global human resources) Ajoyendra Mukherjee said.         
	TCS will continue its campus hirings, but at a slower pace.         
	Ramadorai said some contracts and projects were getting delayed or cancelled. The emphasis is on projects of the Indian government. They are going to invest huge in the coming years, he said.

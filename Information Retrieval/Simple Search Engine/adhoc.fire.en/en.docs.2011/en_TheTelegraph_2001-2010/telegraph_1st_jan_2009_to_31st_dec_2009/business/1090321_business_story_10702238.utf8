The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | High rates hit infrastructure
                                                                                                               High rates hit infrastructure
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                          Kirit Parikh: Voicing concern                                  
	New Delhi, March 20: Planning Commission member Kirit Parikh today said interest rates needed to be reduced further to facilitate a greater flow of funds into the countrys sagging infrastructure.        
	The rate must be 7-8 per cent, which will be a good stimulus, Parikh said on the sidelines of an infrastructure summit organised by the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry.        
	At present, PSU banks lend to the core industries at rates varying between 11.50 per cent and 13 per cent.        
	The Reserve Bank of India has been aggressively cutting its key policy rates since October, but banks are yet to reduce their rates to the same extent.        
	A long-term inflation rate of 3-4 per cent calls for lower rates, Parikh said.         
	Inflation has fallen to a record low of 0.44 per cent for the week ended March 7. This is expected to provide room to the RBI to further cut rates .        
	According to a recent report by consultancy firm McKinsey, India is likely to face a fund shortage of $150-190 billion in infrastructure during the Eleventh Five Year Plan (2007-12) as the global economic slowdown and rising interest rates make financing difficult.        
	The report, titled Building India: Financing and Investing in Infrastructure, cites the exposure limit of banks and investment restrictions on long-term savings, such as insurance and pension fund, as hurdles. In the Eleventh Plan, India had planned to invest $500 billion in infrastructure, with one-fourth coming from public-private partnerships.         
	However, the Planning Commission had made the estimate when the rupee was trading at Rs 41 to a dollar. The Indian currency today closed at 50.64 against the dollar.        
	McKinsey wants banks to be allowed to raise long-term bonds, which are exempt from statutory reserve requirements. The investment limits on insurance firms and pension funds should also be relaxed.                          
	The report says financial firms can earn $1012 billion between 2010 and 2014 from infrastructure. Beyond 2014, the revenue potential is estimated between $25 billion and $29 billion.

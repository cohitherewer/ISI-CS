	It took just 24 months from the date of land allotment to deliver the first set of cars to its maiden customer.         
	The company has already obtained orders for 424 Movia metro cars from the DMRC. Bombardier is also looking forward to cater to other metro railways that will soon be introduced in the big cities by the urban development ministry.

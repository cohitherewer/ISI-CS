	New Delhi, July 22: Reliance Communications (R-Com) will offer its telecom towers for use by Etisalat Dynamix Balwas. The deal will be implemented by Reliance Telecom Infrastructure Limited (RTIL), which is 95 per cent-owned by R-Com.        
	Anil Ambanis R-Com is expected to earn around Rs 10,000 crore from the 10-year deal.         
	Etisalat Dynamix Balwas is a joint venture between the Mumbai-based Dynamix Balwas group and the UAE-based Etisalat group.        
	The deal will cover around 50,000 towers R-Com owns and operates and will help Etisalat roll out its network without having to set up towers.        
	Under the terms of the agreement, Etisalat and its subsidiary will outsource their infrastructure for the 15 telecom circles, encompassing end-to-end tower and transmission infrastructure, to Reliance Infratel and Reliance Communications, respectively, Etisalat and R-Com said in a joint statement.        
	Etisalat chairman Mohammad Hassan Omran said, As a new entrant in this dynamic market, this alliance provides us with key, strategic advantages that will ensure a robust and cost-effective rollout of services.         
	Etisalat has a licence to offer mobile services in 15 of the 22 telecom circles in the country.

  UBI to get Rs 800cr in two phases          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Fund pick                                        
	New Delhi, March 30: The Centre will infuse Rs 800 crore into the United Bank of India in two tranches as part of a capital restructuring plan.         
	The restructuring of the paid-up capital will improve key financial indicators of the bank and the additional funds will help the bank extend more credit to the productive sectors of the economy, home minister P. Chidambaram told reporters after the cabinet meeting today.        
	The government will invest Rs 250 crore by March 31, and another Rs 550 crore in the next financial year in Tier-I capital instruments of the state-run bank.        
	Banks have to maintain a total capital adequacy ratio  equity and debt capital  of 9 per cent, but the government prefers 12 per cent as a cushion in these troubled times.        
	The paid-up equity of UBI will be reduced by over 80 per cent to Rs 266.43 crore. The government will take back excess paid-up capital of Rs 1,266 crore and invest this amount in the capital reserves of the bank, he said.        
	The cabinet had earlier allowed the UBI to write off its accumulated losses of Rs 278.44 crore against the capital of Rs 1,810.87 crore.        
	Banks have been finding it difficult to raise fresh equity but they have had to adhere to the Reserve Bank of Indias capital adequacy rules and also meet the rising demand for loans.        
	So far this year, the cabinet approved Rs 3,800 crore in the shares of three state-run banks  Uco Bank, Central Bank and Vijaya Bank.        
	India had sought the World Banks help to recapitalise 17-18 state-run banks by the end of March 2010, and help them increase the capital adequacy ratio.         
	The World Bank has promised $3 billion for the banks and infrastructure firms.        
	Two public sector banks, Union Bank of India and Dena Bank, today cut their benchmark prime lending rates by 0.50 per cent and 0.25 per cent, respectively.

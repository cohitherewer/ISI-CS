          OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Oct. 27: Anil Ambanis Reliance Natural Resources Limited today told the Supreme Court that it was not opposed to the governments gas utilisation and pricing policy but wanted it to be applied prospectively, and not retrospectively, to existing contracts.         
	RNRLs counsel Ram Jethmalani had intervened when Reliance Industries counsel Harish Salve said the policy was the most suitable arrangement for the supply of gas to RNRL.        
	Reliance Industries and RNRL are engaged in a bitter legal battle on the right price of gas from Reliances fields in the Krishna-Godavari basin.

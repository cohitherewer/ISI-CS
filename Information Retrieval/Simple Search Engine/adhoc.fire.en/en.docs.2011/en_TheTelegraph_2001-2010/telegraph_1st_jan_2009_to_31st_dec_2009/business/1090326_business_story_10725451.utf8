The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Mobile alert on use of illegal handsets
                                                                                                               Mobile alert on use of illegal handsets
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                               
	New Delhi, March 25: Telecom operators have started informing their subscribers that cell phones without valid international mobile equipment identity (IMEI) number will soon be disconnected.        
	Concerned about national security, the department of telecom (DoT) had asked operators to disconnect services to users whose mobiles do not have an IMEI number by March 31. Every mobile has a unique 15-digit code, or IMEI, which can be known by keying * on a handset.         
	It prevents the use of stolen handsets for making calls and allows lawful interceptions to prove the use of a particular device.         
	However, some operators are finding it difficult to meet the March 31 deadline.         
	What the DoT is trying to do is to block all calls with zeroes as IMEI numbers or from blacklisted numbers. That adds an extra load on networks. There are so many combinations of non-genuine IMEI numbers that it is extremely difficult to block them, said a senior official of a top telecom firm.         
	The IMEI number appears on the operators network whenever a call is made. The DoT had asked the service providers to equip networks with Equipment Identity Register to check whether calls were made from genuine handsets.         
	Phones bought from the grey market and cheap Chinese handsets do not have genuine IMEI numbers. It is estimated that there are about 25 million such mobiles.        
	According to the Indian Cellular Association, the body representing handset makers, the rampant use of illegal handsets is because such devices are not checked when they enter the country through sea or air.        
	Already firms have failed to meet one deadline  January 6  and sources said it would get extended again.

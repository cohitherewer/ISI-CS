	Calcutta, Oct. 15: Uco Banks second-quarter net profit has increased 38.66 per cent to Rs 208 crore.         
	Ucos earnings would have been more had its net profit from the overseas business not declined 51 per cent to Rs 16 crore. The public sector bank has recorded a 64.1 per cent jump in net profit from domestic operations to Rs 192 crore that more than offset the decline in profitability from the overseas business.        
	With the global financial turmoil cooling down, we expect our global business to go back to normal levels and well be able to improve our results further in the next six months of the current financial year, said S.K. Goel, chairman and managing director of Uco.        
	The bank, which is planning to come out with a follow-on public issue in the first week of January, reported earning per share of Rs 7.04 at the end of September, up from Rs 5.16 a year ago. The Uco stock today traded at Rs 56.90, or nearly eight times premium to its earning per share on the National Stock Exchange.        
	Bajaj Auto net        
	Bajaj Auto has reported its highest ever net profit in a quarter of Rs 402.83 crore, driven by good sales in the profitable bigger and sportier motorcycles category.        
	The companys second-quarter standalone net profit is a two-fold increase over the Rs 184.91 crore posted in the same period last fiscal.         
	The company also registered a 14.48 per cent growth in its standalone turnover at Rs 2,909.24 crore.        
	Total vehicle sales increased 7.29 per cent to 6,86,727 units, which included the highest ever exports in a single quarter at 2,24,334 units, a rise of 8.41 per cent.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Satyam ready to invite bids 
                                                                                                               Satyam ready to invite bids 
                          Action TIme                     
	Mumbai, March 8 (PTI): The government-appointed board of Satyam Computer plans to invite bids for a strategic investor early this week and hopes to complete the selection process within a month, a top source said.        
	The board proposes to invite expressions of interest by Tuesday. Once this is done, the selection process can be completed within three-four weeks, the source said.        
	The board is likely to meet in Hyderabad on Friday.        
	A host of players, including engineering major Larsen amp; Toubro, the B.K. Modi-led Spice group and the Hindujas, have evinced interest in acquiring Satyam.        
	L amp;T, which has more than a 12 per cent stake in Satyam, is understood to have appointed investment bankers Citi and Nomura to advise it on a possible deal with the firm.        
	The Hyderabad-based IT major had recently received approval from market regulator Sebi to conduct a global competitive bidding to sell a 51 per cent stake to a strategic investor.         
	The investor can acquire up to 31 per cent of Satyams share capital through preferential allotment and the remaining 20 per cent through an open offer.        
	The Satyam board, which is believed to have finalised the modalities in terms of the bidding price, is in consultation with its two investment bankers  Goldman Sachs and Avendus  to quicken the process, the source said.        
	On Friday, the board will assess the prevailing situation in Satyam, including the collection of receivables, status of new orders and progress of the bidding process.        
	Though the board prefers an Indian player as a strategic partner, the final decision will be taken after evaluating all factors, including the capability of the investor to mobilise working capital for the crisis-ridden company.        
	The acquirer may not enjoy the assistance of this board as it may not continue for long after the buyout, the source said, adding that the investors would have to factor this in while taking their call.

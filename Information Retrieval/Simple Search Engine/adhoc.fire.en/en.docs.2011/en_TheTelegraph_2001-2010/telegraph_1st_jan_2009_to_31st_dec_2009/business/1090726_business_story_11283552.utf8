          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                    
	Mumbai, July 25: ICICI Bank, the countrys second largest commercial bank, reported a 21 per cent growth in net profit at Rs 878 crore in the first quarter ended June 30 on the back of strong treasury income. In the same quarter last year, the bank had earned a net profit of Rs 728 crore.        
	Analysts had estimated the largest private sector bank to report a net profit of around Rs 760 crore during the period.        
	Treasury income  arising mainly from dealing in government bonds  underpinned the solid performance during the first quarter.         
	The bank reported a treasury income of Rs 714 crore against a loss of Rs 594 crore in the corresponding period last year.        
	The strong treasury income offset the 5 per cent decline in the banks net interest income (NII) which represents a banks core operations.         
	NII of the bank came down to Rs 1,985 crore compared with Rs 2,090 crore in the same period last year. However, non-interest income grew to Rs 2,090 crore (Rs 1,538 crore), mainly led by treasury income. Fee income also dipped to Rs 1,319 crore from Rs 1,958 crore in the year-ago period.        
	ICICI Bank said the lower level of fee income was because of reduced investment and merger and acquisition activity in the corporate sector and lower level of fees from the distribution of retail financial products, reflecting the continued impact of the adverse global economic conditions on the operating environment.        
	Over the past few months, ICICI Bank has refrained from growing its balance sheet aggressively by sharply reducing the focus on non-collateralised loans with a view to containing risks in a challenging environment. The loan book of the bank shrank to Rs 198,102 crore on June 30, 2009, from Rs 224,146 crore on the same day last year.        
	Eveready profit        
	Dry cell battery major Eveready Industries India has reported a net profit of Rs 16 crore in the first quarter of 2009-10 against Rs 3 crore in the corresponding quarter last year. Net sales were up at Rs 232 crore compared with Rs 219 crore a year ago.

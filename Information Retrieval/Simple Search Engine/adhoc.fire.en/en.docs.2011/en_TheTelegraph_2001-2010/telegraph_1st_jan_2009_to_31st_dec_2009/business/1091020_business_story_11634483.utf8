                                                                                                               Big win for Lodhas in Birla board berth case
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                    
	Calcutta, Oct. 19: The Lodhas today scored a significant victory in the battle for control of the MP Birla empire when the Company Law Board (CLB) dismissed a petition challenging the appointment of Harsh Vardhan Lodha to the Birla Corporation board.        
	Rajendra Singh Lodha (Harshs father) was the chairman of Birla Corporation, the flagship of the Rs 5,000-crore group, before he died in London last year.        
	MP Birlas wife Priyamvada had bequeathed her estate to R.S. Lodha by a will which the Birla family had challenged in the courts.        
	After his fathers death, Harsh Vardhan had staked claim to become the chairman of Birla Corp.         
	The Birlas had appealed that the companys board be superseded, and the CLB put its own men till the court decided on the principal issue  who should inherit the MP Birla empire. Both the Birlas and the Lodhas had filed their own sets of wills for caveat.        
	The Birlas had argued that there were mismanagement in the company and suppression of facts. They had demanded a freeze on the voting rights that the Lodhas enjoyed following the 1999 will of Priyamvada Birla.        
	CLB chairman S. Balasubramanian today said the plea was aimed at ousting the Lodhas from the management and not for protecting the interest of the company.        
	The petition was filed by a few individuals and Rameshwar Jute Mills  a Birla managed company.        
	Balasubramanian said after an overall assessment of the merits of the case, the petition deserved to be dismissed on various grounds.        
	Accordingly I dismiss the petition and subsisting interim orders, he said.        
	Debanjan Mandal, counsel for the Lodhas, said he was very happy with the judgment.

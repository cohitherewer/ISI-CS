The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Recovery signs cheer up rich nations
                                                                                                               Recovery signs cheer up rich nations

	Washington, June 14: Financial chiefs from the G8 industrialised nations have offered their most optimistic assessment yet of the global crisis, noting encouraging signs of economic stabilisation and calling for an exit strategy from the policies that have been used to stimulate growth around the world.         
	Following two days of meetings in Lecce, Italy, the eight finance ministers, including US treasury secretary Timothy F. Geithner and his counterparts from Britain, France, Germany, Italy, Canada, Japan and Russia, have agreed to create a set of common principles and standards governing the conduct of international business and finance.         
	The strategy for obtaining those goals, would be known as the Lecce Framework.         
	It will have the objective of identifying and filling in the regulatory gaps that helped cause the current crisis.         
	Geithner, in particular, called on international banking regulators to map out better ways to quickly resolve failures of cross-border financial firms.         
	In Europe, officials have already moved to adopt new measures for more rigorous oversight of rating agencies and firms selling securitised assets.         
	Geithner pledged the US would offer its own broad proposals for more conservative standards when it unveils a much anticipated reform plan to overhaul domestic financial regulation later this week.         
	Treasury officials said the plan would include measures to set tougher capital standards and oversight for banks, better co-ordinated oversight of global financial institutions, and improve monitoring and transparency in global derivatives markets.

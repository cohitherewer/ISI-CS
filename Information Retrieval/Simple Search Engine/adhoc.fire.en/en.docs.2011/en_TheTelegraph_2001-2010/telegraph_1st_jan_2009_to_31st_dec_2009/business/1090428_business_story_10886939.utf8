The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | General Motors rolls out viability plan

	Detroit, April 27 (Reuters): General Motors Corp on Monday announced plans to close plants, cut hourly workers and dealers and to eliminate its Pontiac brand in an effort to meet government demands for a quicker and deeper restructuring.        
	The new viability plan was announced as GM filed plans for an exchange of $27.2 billion of bonds for common stock, warning that it would seek bankruptcy protection if the offer did not receive sufficient interest.        
	GM hopes to cut $44 billion of liabilities through the bond exchange, and by adjusting the funding of a healthcare trust for United Auto Workers union retirees that would be funded half by GM equity.        
	In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, GM said it was offering to issue 225 shares of its common stock for each $1,000 principal of notes and to pay cash for the accrued interest. Bondholders will hold about 10 per cent of the company after a successful exchange offer.        
	The White House task force called the bond exchange an important restructuring step and said the new programme showed progress and it would continue to work with the GM management as it refined the plan. GM shares rose 9.5 per cent to $1.85 on Monday in pre-market trading.        
	GM, which last week took $2 billion of emergency US government loans to bring its total to $15.4 billion so far, was told by the Obama administration in late March to dig deeper and move faster for continued support by June 1.        
	The auto maker plans to focus on four core brands in the United States  Chevrolet, Cadillac, Buick and GMC and phase out the Pontiac brand by the end of next year.        
	Overall structural costs in North America will be reduced by an additional $1.8 billion in 2010 from the plan submitted to the government in mid-February to $23.2 billion.        
	The cuts accelerate plans that were submitted to the government, but rejected as too small and too slow when former chief executive Rick Wagoner was ousted.        
	GM said the new plan called for deep cuts by the end of 2010, reducing the number of US plants to 34 from 47, slashing the US hourly workforce by about 21,000 to 40,000 and cutting its dealer network to 3,605 from 6,246.

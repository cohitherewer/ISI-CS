                                                                                                               Fresh flare-up over gas pricing formula
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Deora: Argument continues                                  
	New Delhi, Aug. 6: Theres no let-up in the war of words between the government and Anil Ambanis camp on the raging dispute over gas supplies from the Krishna-Godavari (KG) basin. This time the battle is over the pricing formula for gas sales from the KG-D6 field, of which Mukesh Ambanis Reliance Industries Limited (RIL) is the contractor.         
	Anil Ambani-owned RNRL today said the price fixed by the group of ministers was not at arms length as claimed by petroleum minister Murli Deora. The formula was questioned by both the Prime Ministers economic advisory council (EAC) and the cabinet secretary, it said.        
	The pricing formula was engineered by RIL and had no prior approval of the oil ministry. The process was rigged by inviting bids from select and stranded customers, J.P. Chalasani, RNRL spokesperson and Reliance Power CEO, told reporters during a conference call.        
	Earlier in the day, Deora said in the Rajya Sabha that the price of gas produced by RIL at $4.2 per million British thermal unit (mBtu) was lower than the price of other operators.         
	UKs BG-led consortium charges $5.51 per mBtu for gas from Panna/Mukta and Tapti; Cairn charges $4.3 for Ravva gas and $4.75 for Lakshmi.        
	According to the minister, the RIL formula was considered by an empowered group of ministers (eGoM) and was examined by a panel headed by the cabinet secretary as well as the EAC.         
	Having considered the report, the EGoM approved the price formula on September 12, 2007, Deora said. Chalasani, however, said the cabinet secretarys report and the EAC had made adverse comments on the pricing formula.        
	Meanwhile, investor advisory firm Bernstein Energy has said the KG basin field cannot be sustained at a lower gas price of $2.40 per mBtu.

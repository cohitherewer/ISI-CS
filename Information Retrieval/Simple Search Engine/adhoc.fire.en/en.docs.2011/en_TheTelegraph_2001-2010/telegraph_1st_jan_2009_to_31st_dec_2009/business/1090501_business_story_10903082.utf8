                                                                                                               PNB cuts lending, deposit rates
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                          Chakrabarty: Paying heed                                  
	New Delhi, April 30: Punjab National Bank today slashed its benchmark prime lending rate by 50 basis points to 11 per cent.        
	The bank also revised its retail deposit rates by 25-100 basis points across all maturities. The peak retail deposit rate for three years to less than five years has been reduced to 7.5 per cent, said K.C. Chakrabarty, chairman and managing director of PNB.         
	For term deposits up to 45 days, the reduction is up to 100 basis points, while fixed deposits up to two years will be cheaper by 50 basis points.        
	Interest rates on car, education, reverse mortgage and personal loans have been reduced by 25-50 basis points.         
	Floating rate housing loan has been reduced by 25 basis points and will now range between 8.75 per cent and 10 per cent, depending on the tenure and amount, said Chakrabarty.        
	All rates are effective from May 1 and the reduction in BPLR will be applicable to all existing and new accounts.        
	The countrys second largest public sector lender also said the threshold under its special housing loan scheme (fixed) had been raised to Rs 50 lakh at a lower interest rate of 9 per cent, which will be reset at the end of five years. The scheme is valid up to June-end.         
	The Reserve Bank of India, while announcing its annual monetary policy, had urged banks to reduce the lending rates to spur demand in the economy.        
	Bank credit growth has dipped to 17 per cent for the year ended March 2009, against 22.3 per cent in the same period last year.         
	While PNB has been quick to respond to the RBIs plea, others such as the Union Bank of India, Uco Bank and the Bank of Baroda are expected to take a decision soon.         
	M.V. Nair, chairman and managing director of the Union Bank of India, said the benchmark prime lending rate of public sector banks was expected to come down by 75-100 basis point over a year.

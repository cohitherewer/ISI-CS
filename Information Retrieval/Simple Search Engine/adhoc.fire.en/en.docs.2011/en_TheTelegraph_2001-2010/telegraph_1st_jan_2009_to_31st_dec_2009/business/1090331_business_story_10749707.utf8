The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Zandu merger on Emami agenda
                                                                                                               Zandu merger on Emami agenda
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Calcutta, March 30: Five months after taking over Zandu Pharmaceuticals, city-based Emami is planning to merge the company with itself.        
	The boards of Emami and Zandu met separately today over restructuring the businesses and formed a committee of directors for this purpose. The committee is likely to appoint legal advisers, valuers and merchant bankers to chart out the rejig exercise.        
	Emami will also take up the recast of Emami Realty, a wholly owned subsidiary.        
	Previously there was a plan for Emami Ltd to transfer its holding in Emami Realty to a separate entity to focus on the core business of FMCG.         
	The board is expected to take a month to decide how to go forward with the restructuring exercise, a senior Emami official said, adding that the effort was to derive a maximum benefit from the synergies between Zandu and Emami.        
	Both Zandu and Emami operate in the FMCG space but cater to different segments. Zandu is primarily an ayurvedic player, while Emami is present in the personal care segment with brands such as Navaratna oil and Sona Chandi Chyawanprash.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Poor rain spooks cane growers
                                                                                                               Poor rain spooks cane growers
          JAYANTA ROY CHOWDHURY                       Crisis Period                          
	Bhainswal (Western Uttar Pradesh), Aug. 16: Vikram Singh, a 36-year-old sugarcane farmer, is frowning anxiously at the sky.         
	After about 25 days of near drought conditions, it has been raining since Friday in his village, comprising mainly Jat farmers and which is off the Delhi-Sahranpur highway. Farmers such as Singh have taken to study cloud formations to gauge whether the rain will last or end soon.         
	Singh, who owns about 12 acres of sugarcane fields, said, If the rain stays, we are saved somewhat. Otherwise the cane we planted will fail.         
	A met department forecast on Friday had forecast rain and thundershowers at many places over Uttar Pradesh.         
	But nobody takes the official forecast seriously in this village.         
	As Vikram puts it scornfully, Even our kids predict weather better than them. Cane planted in July-August in western Uttar Pradesh, Indias sugar bowl, feeds off the rain in July-September to mature.         
	The sparse rainfall till now could spell doom for many farmers such as Vikram in this otherwise prosperous part of Uttar Pradesh.         
	The heartland states chief minister, Mayavati, may meet Manmohan Singh separately to seek relief on Monday on the sidelines of a meeting of chief ministers called by the Prime Minister. She has already declared some 47 districts drought affected.         
	But farmers here point out that Mayavati wants money mostly for eastern UP, from where she thinks she will get votes, and for Bundelkhand, where she wants to fight Rahul Gandhi. Nobody talks of us.         
	Retail sugar prices in Delhi have already risen almost 40 per cent in about five months to about Rs 32-35 a kg.         
	Farmers complain of depleting water levels because of constant use of pumps to lift ground water. Only more rain can help, or else the government will have to give us dole, says a grim Avdesh Singh who owns about 10 acres of sugarcane fields.         
	India requires about 22 million tonnes (mt) of sugar every year and is expected to produce just 15mt in the sugar year ended September 2009, while National Federation of Co-operative Sugar Factories Limited says the output for the next year will be around 18mt.        
	Last year, most sugar mills in Uttar Pradesh had to shut down after about three months, instead of operating for five months as they did not have enough cane to crush. We think those mills will face a similar situation this year, too, said Vikram.         
	Global traders have already started jacking up prices. Raw sugar prices have gone up 25 per cent in less than four weeks on the London and New York commodities market and are currently ruling at $53 a tonne.         
	Meanwhile, agriculture minister Sharad Pawar has called a meeting of state civil supplies ministers on Wednesday to crack down on hoarders. But with demand far outstripping supplies, Pawars resolve may not be enough.         
	States plea        
	Bihar, Uttar Pradesh, Jharkhand and Manipur have approached the central government for assistance to fight the drought-like conditions.         
	The agriculture ministry has been asked to work out a scheme in a collaboration with the finance ministry to extend loan tenures and restructure existing debts at lower interest rates.

                                                                                                               Industry grows 7.8% in June
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                            
	New Delhi, Aug. 12: Industrial production grew 7.8 per cent in June, its fastest pace in 16 months, sending clear signs of an economic recovery. However, below normal monsoon could mar the party as rural demand would be hit, analysts said.        
	Manufacturing, which was the worst affected by the slowdown, grew 7.3 per cent in June against 6.1 per cent a year ago  a sign of the governments fiscal and monetary stimulus having an impact.        
	Overall, industrial output rose for the third straight month and clocked its highest rate of expansion since February 2008.         
	I expect the positive trends (in industrial growth) to continue. However, the weak monsoon could have some impact on overall GDP, Montek Singh Ahluwalia, deputy chairman of the Planning Commission, said.        
	Manufacturing, which makes up 80 per cent of the index of industrial production (IIP), rose for the third month in a row.         
	Output at mines surged 15.4 per cent, while power generation climbed 8 per cent.        
	The output of capital goods climbed 11.8 per cent, while the production of consumer durables jumped 15.5 per cent. However, consumer goods grew 4 per cent, almost half of last years growth.        
	High growth in the capital goods sector is a sign of turnaround and the positive trend in industrial output will continue, finance secretary Ashok Chawla said.        
	Sonal Varma, economist with Nomura, said, The key question is whether this trend can be sustained. While the global economy is gradually recovering, the risk of a deficient monsoon hurting industrial output growth is real.        
	Crisils D.K. Joshi said, The combined dose of monetary and fiscal measures is showing a positive impact on the economy. However, monsoon can have a dampening effect on growth.

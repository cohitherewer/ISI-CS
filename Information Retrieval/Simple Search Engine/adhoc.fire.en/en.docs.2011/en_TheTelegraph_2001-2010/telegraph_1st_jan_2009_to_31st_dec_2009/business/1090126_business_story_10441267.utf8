          OUR BUREAU                      Manwani: Confident                          
	Mumbai, Jan. 25: Hindustan Unilever Ltd, which has reported a marginal drop in net profit for the quarter ended December 31, 2008, is confident that its bottom line will improve with a fall in raw material prices.         
	The FMCG major has registered a 2.49 per cent dip in net profit at Rs 615.74 crore for the quarter under review against Rs 631.44 crore during the corresponding quarter of the previous fiscal.         
	Net sales of the company during the quarter went up to Rs 4,307.71 crore from Rs 3,687.4 crore a year ago, HUL said in a release.        
	The companys home and personal care division clocked a sales revenue of Rs 3,268.82 crore during the quarter in the domestic market compared with Rs 2,706.64 crore a year ago.         
	This has been attributed to the increase in the prices of soaps and detergents and overall growth in the volume of personal products.         
	Revenue from the foods division stood at Rs 706.04 crore compared with Rs 571.8 crore in the year-ago quarter.        
	HUL chairman Harish Manwani said, We continue to deliver strong top line and operating profit growth. Softening commodity prices augur well for the business as we sustain our focus on delivering superior consumer value. We remain determined to leverage our strong portfolio and scale to deliver competitive and profitable growth.        
	During the quarter under review, HUL has suffered a loss of Rs 30.29 crore on exceptional items against a gain of Rs 112.87 crore in the corresponding quarter of the previous fiscal.         
	A loss of Rs 16.5 crore on extraordinary items has also impacted the companys bottom line.        
	Exports came down to Rs 264.97 crore during the quarter under review from Rs 343.65 crore in the quarter ended December 31, 2007.        
	HULs expenditure went up to Rs 3,655.22 crore during October-December 2008 from Rs 3,161.1 crore in the same quarter of the previous fiscal.        
	HULs vice-chairman D. Sundaram said the company would leverage on its powerful brand strength, innovation and strategies to reach out to all sections of the income pyramid to bolster business.        
	He said HUL had spent Rs 371.02 crore on brand promotion in the reporting quarter compared with Rs 375.9 crore during the the same quarter last year.        
	The focus will be on lower costs and higher operating efficiencies, Sundaram said.

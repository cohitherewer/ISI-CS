          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Mumbai, March 23: The State Bank of India (SBI) will charge an interest rate of 11.75-12 per cent on Nano loans.        
	The countrys largest commercial bank said it would finance 100 per cent booking amount at a low down payment beginning from Rs 2,999.        
	The Nano car loan can be taken for a maximum period of seven years and the sale of application forms and acceptance of the booking amount at SBI branches will start from April 9 and last till April 25. More than 1,350 branches of the SBI will assist in the booking process.        
	Apart from extending loans for buying the Nano, the refund to unsuccessful applicants would also be available at the SBI branches.        
	At present, the SBI disburses car loans for three and seven years.         
	Based on a rough calculation, it is estimated that customers will have to pay an equated monthly instalment (EMI) of roughly Rs 1,665 if they were to get finance for the Tata Nano Standard version (BS2 and BS3). This is based on an interest rate of 11.75 per cent for a period of seven years.        
	The ex-showroom price of the Nano standard car in Mumbai is Rs 1,34,250. The booking amount for the car is Rs 95,000, which the banks have promised to bear.        
	The SBI said it would offer a seamless booking loan conversion to a Nano car loan to successful allottees on easy and attractive eligibility norms.

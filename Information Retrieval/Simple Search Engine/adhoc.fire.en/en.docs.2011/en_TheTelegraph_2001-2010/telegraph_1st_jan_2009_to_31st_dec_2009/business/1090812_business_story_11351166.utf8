The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Local pills await fight-flu call
                                                                                                               Local pills await fight-flu call
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Tamiflu tonic                                  
	Mumbai, Aug. 11: Local pharmaceutical companies are ready to produce generic versions of Tamiflu  the wonder drug that is touted as a cure for swine flu.        
	The government will first have to place orders with them before they can gear up for production.        
	Ranbaxy Laboratories and Bangalore-based Strides Arcolab today joined Cipla and a couple of other firms in expressing their readiness to produce generic versions of Tamiflu  or oseltamivir  at short notice.        
	Oseltamivir is a drug developed by Gilead Sciences of the US. Roche markets it around the world under the brand name Tamiflu. It does not hold a patent for the drug here as the companys application was rejected by the Indian Patent Office after a pre-grant opposition by Cipla. Roche has an agreement with the Hyderabad-based Hetero Drugs under which the latter can make the generic Tamiflu.        
	A spokesperson for Ranbaxy said it produced oseltamivir active pharmaceutical ingredient and formulations and if required, it can provide close to a million capsules in the next few weeks to the Indian market.        
	Strides Arcolab is also in a position to supply oseltamivir capsules to meet both domestic and overseas demand.        
	Ranbaxy has so far supplied the drug to Malaysia, Oman and a country in Africa. We stand ready to supply oseltamivir to meet urgent requirements of countries to tide over the crisis emerging from the outbreak of swine flu, the spokesperson added.        
	Hetero Drugs and Natco Pharma are also in the race to win government orders for the drug. On Monday, Union health minister Ghulam Nabi Azad had said that the Centre would procure another 20 million dosages of the drug.        
	Pharmaceutical companies expect the orders to come through shortly.        
	The development has not been lost on the stock markets. The share prices of Strides Arcolab, Ranbaxy and Natco Pharma rose today on the hope that the government would order the drug from them. On the Bombay Stock Exchange, Ranbaxy ended 6.2 per cent higher at Rs 277.10 and Strides gained nearly 5 per cent at Rs 158.90. Natco Pharma leapt by almost 19 per cent to close at Rs 94.85.

	New Delhi, July 3: It was not just Bengal that enjoyed a bounty  railway minister Mamata Banerjee took care to distribute goodies among friends, too.        
	Uttar Pradesh, a state which the Congress is trying to wrest from Mayawatis BSP and from where UPA chief Sonia Gandhi hails, bagged a handful of projects.         
	Six stations of the state Lucknow, Varanasi, Amritsar, Kanpur, Agra Cantonment and Mathura  will be upgrade to world-class standards.        
	The eastern freight corridor announced today will pass mostly through the state.         
	The railways plan to develop cargo and industrial enclaves along the corridor on own land.         
	Mamata said work on the coach factory at Rae Bareli  Sonias constituency  would be hastened.        
	With assembly elections round the corner, Maharashtra also gets trains and projects, including world-class stations for Mumbai (Chhatrapati Shivaji Terminus), Pune and Nagpur.         
	Mamata has given many new projects to Orissa as well, where the ruling BJD had broken off from the BJP before the Lok Sabha polls.        
	On the cards are Duranto non-stop trains from Bhubaneswar to New Delhi, new lines for the backward Koraput area and world-class stations for Bhubaneswar and Puri.         
	The eastern freight corridor is also expected to pay rich dividends to the mineral-rich state of Jharkhand.

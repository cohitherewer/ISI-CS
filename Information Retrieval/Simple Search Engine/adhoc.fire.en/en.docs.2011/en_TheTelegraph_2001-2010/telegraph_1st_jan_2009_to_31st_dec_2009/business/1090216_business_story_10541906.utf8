The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | ITC too close for hotel rivals comfort 
                                                                                                               ITC too close for hotel rivals comfort 
          SAMBIT SAHA       
	Calcutta, Feb. 15: ITC is tantalisingly close to a 15 per cent stake in EIH Ltd  the hospitality giant that owns Calcuttas Grand Hotel.         
	The big question in the air: will it use the opportunity afforded by the recent market downturn to scoop up the 172,276 shares needed to go above the threshold, which will make an open offer to the public mandatory?                   
	The cigarette-to-hotels conglomerate has built up its 14.96 per cent stake in EIH slowly over the past seven years. Between March 31 and December 31 last year, it bought 978,378 shares from the market.         
	ITCs stake in the Oberoi-owned EIH is held through Russell Credit, its investment vehicle.         
	Under Sebis takeover regulations, a company must come out with an open offer for another 20 per cent once it crosses the 15 per cent threshold.         
	When ITC first picked up a small stake in EIH in 2001, there was a buzz of excitement over its intentions. ITC has so far maintained that the EIH share purchase was not a strategic investment  meaning that it wasnt looking for a say in the running of the company.         
	When asked to comment on the fresh acquisition of EIH shares this fiscal, the ITC spokesperson said, As of now, it is a treasury operation.         
	EIH vice-chairman S.S. Mukherjee did not wish to give much importance to the fact that ITC was inching up to a critical threshold.         
	It is immaterial to me whether it is 1 per cent or 14.96 per cent, said Mukherjee, who is also classified as a promoter by EIHs disclosure to the stock exchanges.        
	We do not disclose our plans. But as you can see, it is listed as a long-term investment in the balance sheet, ITC chairman Yogi C. Deveshwar had said at ITCs annual general meeting in July 2008.         
	Deveshwar had told shareholders that ITC would invest in companies with similar business interest. Soon after, the Calcutta-headquartered giant picked up 3 per cent in Hotel Leelaventure and a small stake in Thapar-owned Ballarpur Industries.         
	The Oberois, who own 46.42 per cent in EIH, face no real threat as of now from ITCs moves. PRS Biki Oberoi is the chairman of EIH while his son Vikram and nephew Arjun Oberoi are both designated as managing directors looking after operations and business development, respectively.         
	ITC has developed its own interests in the hospitality sector. The annual turnover from its hotel business is roughly between Rs 1,100 and Rs 1,200 crore  about the same as EIH.         
	The EIH stock closed at Rs 111.90 last Friday. The stock has moved up from its 52-week low of Rs 74 but its way off the high of Rs 194.

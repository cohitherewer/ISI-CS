	Calcutta, July 20: The health insurance sector could soon get a monitoring body that will formulate and implement standards to be followed by insurers, third party administrators, hospitals and policyholders.         
	A 14-member committee, set up by the insurance regulator and headed by S.B. Mathur, secretary-general of the Life Insurance Council, said insurers, third party administrators (TPAs) and hospitals should form a self-regulatory industry body  the Health Insurance Development Council  as a not-for-profit association.         
	The objective of the health council would be to undertake, among other things, standardisation initiatives for claim handling and settlement process; formulate common forms, processes and definitions; monitor compliance with ethical and efficiency standards; and enforce strict vigilance to curb frauds in the health insurance system.        
	The committee has also suggested turnaround times for different services provided by the TPAs, insurers and hospitals. It also recommended that there should be self-regulatory penalty for non-adherence to the maximum acceptable time limits and breach of standards by any entity. The penalty would accrue to the health insurance council.        
	All insurance companies, life, non-life and standalone health insurers, will be members of this council.         
	The health insurance council will have a 12-member governing body which will look after the administration of the council. The governing body will have three members from non-life insurance companies, two representatives from life insurance companies, two representatives from hospitals and one each from standalone health insurance company, TPAs and consumer groups nominated by the IRDA. Each member will be nominated for two years and can be re-elected for another two years. The chairperson shall either be the secretary general of the Life Insurance Council or the General Insurance Council.        
	The panel has proposed that the regulators expenses will be shared by all the insurers in proportion to the health insurance claims settled by them during the previous year.        
	The committee highlighted certain areas that needed attention. These include non-standard billing and payment processes between healthcare providers and insurers, significant variance in the cost of treatment of the same ailment across healthcare providers in the country, lack of control in insurance claims processes and ineffective grievance redressal system.        
	It found healthcare providers were not providing information sought by insurers in a standardised manner and there were no time limits for information exchange.

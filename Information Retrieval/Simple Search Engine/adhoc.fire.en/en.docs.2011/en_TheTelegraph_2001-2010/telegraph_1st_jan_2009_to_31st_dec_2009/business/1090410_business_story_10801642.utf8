                                                                                                               Lupin, Natco in drug pact 
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Mumbai, April 9: Lupin Ltd and Hyderabad-based Natco have entered into an alliance to commercialise the generic version of Shire Plcs Fosrenol tablets in the US used in kidney ailments.        
	If the duo succeed in their effort, they could get a 180-day marketing exclusivity.        
	Shire had filed a suit against Natco for infringing two patents for Fosrenol in response to an abbreviated new drug application (Anda) of the Indian firm. The Hyderabad-based company had sought approval from the US Food and Drug Administration to market and sell generic versions of Shires 500mg, 750mg and 1gm of Fosrenol tablets.         
	The Anda is an application made to secure approval for manufacturing and selling the generic version of a drug in the US.         
	Natco and Lupin said they were among the first to file an application, which would give them an edge in terms of exclusivity. Sales of Fosrenol stood at $108 million as on December 2008.        
	Nilesh Gupta, group president and executive director on the Lupin board, said, The alliance creates synergies that will enable portfolio expansion and contribute to consolidating our presence in the US. Lupins marketing reach and expertise coupled with Natcos solid development and manufacturing abilities make for a great combination.        
	Rajeev Nannapaneni, chief operating officer of Natco, said the alliance would maximise opportunities in an increasingly competitive generic business.        
	Nasdaq-listed Shire is the third largest pharmaceutical company in the UK. Natco Pharma has a presence in various therapeutic categories, including anti-asthma, gastroenterology, vitamins and anti-allergic drugs.        
	It had reported a consolidated revenue of Rs 117 crore for the quarter ended December 31, 2008 against Rs 95 crore a year ago, a growth rate of 22.5 per cent. For the nine-month period, the companys consolidated revenues stood at Rs 331 crore against Rs 257 crore, a rise of 29 per cent.         
	On the BSE today, Natco shares rose 14.8 per cent to close at Rs 59.35 while Lupin finished in the red at Rs 646.75.

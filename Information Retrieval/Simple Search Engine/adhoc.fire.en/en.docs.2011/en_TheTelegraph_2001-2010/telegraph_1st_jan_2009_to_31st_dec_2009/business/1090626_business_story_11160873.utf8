	Calcutta, June 25: The Pune-based $2.4-billion Kirloskar group will hive off its non-manufacturing investments into separate companies as part of a restructuring exercise.         
	Two entities  Kirloskar Brothers Ltd (KBL) and Kirloskar Oil Engines Ltd (KOEL)  will be recast first.         
	The process of hiving off non-manufacturing investments into a separate entity has already been started and will be completed in two months, KBL vice-president Pradeep Chapalgaonkar said here today. The group had initiated restructuring in February.        
	KBL, which makes water pumps and undertakes water supply and irrigation contracts, has already formed a company  Kirloskar Brothers Investments Ltd  to transfer some of its non-manufacturing investments.        
	KOEL, which makes power gensets for tractors, agriculture and construction sectors, will also be restructured, Chapalgaonkar said, adding that the process was taking time because of some legal issues.        
	However, he refused to divulge the value of the non-manufacturing investments. It is learnt that the new entities will be structured according to the shareholding patterns of the parent companies.        
	As on March 31, 2009, the promoters held 62.32 per cent in KBL, public shareholding stood at 24.28 per cent and the remaining 13.40 per cent were held by mutual funds, insurance companies and foreign institutional investors.         
	After the restructuring, shareholders will get a chance to own shares worth their current investment in both the manufacturing and investment companies.        
	For the financial year ended March 2008, KBL reported investments of Rs 1,278 crore in its listed and unlisted companies.         
	These include Rs 293 crore in unlisted subsidiaries such as Kirloskar Silk Industries Ltd and Kirloskar Constructions and Engineers Ltd.         
	KOEL has set up a panel to examine the merits of restructuring or hiving off its investments into a separate company.

	New Delhi, April 15: Telecom service providers are keen to provide mobile value-added services in rural areas.         
	Applications such as information on commodity prices, crop and weather data and other local concerns are likely to find acceptance in the semi-urban and rural areas, Pankaj Sharma, chief marketing officer of Cellebrum, told The Telegraph.        
	Cellebrum, a telecom value-added services provider, has created specific portals for information on a wide range of topics  from mandi rates and weather reports to career counselling and hospital databases.        
	Our portal on mandi rates is a voice-based application in which the farmer gets to know the latest rates of over 7,000 commodities. It is already used by service providers such as Idea Cellular in the different rural belts of the country, said Sharma.         
	Other services in the offing include information on agriculture, health and education.        
	Operators expect demand to rise in the rural parts which are relatively less affected by the economic downturn. We expect rural subscribers to account for 40 per cent of the total subscriber base by 2012 compared with 25 per cent now, Credit Suisse said in an industry report.         
	At present, the countrys mobile subscriber base stands at over 375 million. Of this, a quarter comes from the rural areas. State-owned Bharat Sanchar Nigam has the maximum reach in rural India followed by Bharti Airtel, Vodafone Essar and Aircel.

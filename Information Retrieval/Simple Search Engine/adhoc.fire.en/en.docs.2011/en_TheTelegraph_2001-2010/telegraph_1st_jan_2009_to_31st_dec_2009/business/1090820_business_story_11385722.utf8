	New Delhi, Aug. 19: India has overtaken China to become Nokias second biggest market.        
	So far, the US followed by China had contributed the most to the handset makers revenues. This year, India, riding on its rapidly expanding mobile market, has surpassed China.        
	The Indian consumer is looking for integrated solutions which combine entertainment with business applications. Sales of Nokia smartphones, including the N97 and the N86, have increased in the second quarter of 2009, said Olli-Pekka Kallasvuo, president and CEO of Nokia Corporation.        
	The Finnish company is betting on gaming, music, mobile commerce and other applications to add to the revenues in India.         
	Nokia has started manufacturing more of its sophisticated handsets and smartphones at its Chennai plant, said Kallasvuo. The smartphone market in India, including iPhones, is estimated at 6 million units for 2009, yielding revenues of Rs 7,800 crore.        
	According to the company, the drought will not affect the sales of mobile phones. Farmers pay Rs 2 per day to subscribe to Life Tools  which gives information on agriculture, education and entertainment  to get information on weather and crop price, which otherwise would have cost Rs 30-35 a day. So, under the present situation (drought), the demand is likely to surge, said D. Shivakumar, vice-president and managing director of Nokia India.

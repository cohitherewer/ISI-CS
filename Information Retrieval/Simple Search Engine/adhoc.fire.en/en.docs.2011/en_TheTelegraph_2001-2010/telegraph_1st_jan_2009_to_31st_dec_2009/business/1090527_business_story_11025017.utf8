                                                                                                               Bata plan to march ahead
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Sinha: New outlook                                   
	Calcutta, May 26: Bata India plans to open 65-70 new stores this year and renovate 30. The shoe major is close to completing its restructuring exercise. Bata now has no loss-making store within its pan-India retail network, chairman P.M. Sinha said after the annual general meeting today.         
	We have either closed loss-making stores or revived them with fresh investment. All our 1,250 outlets are doing well now, Sinha said.        
	Bata enjoys a 33 per cent share in the organised shoe market. The company has been able to increase sales and improve margins despite the adverse economic conditions.        
	In 2008, it increased gross margins by 3 per cent by cutting costs. Bata will try to improve margins by 0.5-1 per cent this year too, director (finance) Shaibal Sinha said.        
	The chairman said the company would want to tap the growing rural market. We will create an appropriate retail platform for that, he said.        
	In the cities, Bata has introduced a management model at the shop level to boost sales.        
	Around 200 stores are now run by franchisees, many of whom used to be managers at the same stores. However, the property continues to be owned by the company and so are the goods.        
	The company also plans to enter the defence and paramilitary segment. Bata has put in place a dedicated team to secure contracts for this segment.

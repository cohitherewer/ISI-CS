                                                                                                               State Bank succour for drought-hit farmers
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Mumbai, Sept. 3: The State Bank of India today announced a slew of measures, including interest rate cuts on irrigation and crop loans, to support drought-hit farmers.        
	Even in such an adverse environment, the SBI is optimistic of increasing farm loans in the current year to Rs 33,500 crore from around Rs 24,000 crore a year ago. Over the last two years, the countrys largest lender has been expanding its network with a special focus on rural areas.         
	Interest rates on minor irrigation loans of up to Rs 25 lakh have been cut to 8 per cent in the first year and 9 per cent in the second and third years. The card rate will be applicable from the fourth year. Existing rates are in the range of 10.5-13.25 per cent. Crop loans between Rs 3 lakh and Rs 25 lakh will be charged at the rate of 10 per cent for one year. At present, crop loans in the Rs 3-5 lakh bracket are priced at 11.75 per cent, while those between Rs 5 lakh and Rs 25 lakh are offered at 12.75 per cent.        
	Other reliefs include lowering the margin money requirement for new minor irrigation loans to 10 per cent from 15-25 per cent of the project cost. Margin money is the amount of cash that borrowers will have to pay upfront.        
	Niranjan Parsha, general manager (agri business unit) of the SBI, told The Telegraph that the bank had not experienced any drastic fall in the demand for agricultural loans.

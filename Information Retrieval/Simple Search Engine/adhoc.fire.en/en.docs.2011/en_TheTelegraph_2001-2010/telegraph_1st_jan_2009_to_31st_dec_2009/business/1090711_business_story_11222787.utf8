The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Industry show lifts mood
                                                                                                               Industry show lifts mood
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, July 10: Buoyed by a strong domestic demand, industry grew 2.7 per cent in May  the second consecutive month of growth  and the government claimed that the worst of the economic crisis was over.        
	Industrial growth is showing signs of further improvement. I think we are back on track as was expected, finance secretary Ashok Chawla said.        
	Though industrial growth in May was down from 4.4 per cent a year ago, it was more than double the 1.2 per cent growth in April. Growth in April turned positive after being in the negative territory almost every month since October 2008.        
	Output had fallen in December, February and March as the economy was hit hard by a sudden liquidity crunch and the global downturn.        
	The slump in demand in the US and Europe is still affecting merchandise exports, which fell 29 per cent in May, hampering a broader recovery.        
	According to data, consumer durable production rose 12.4 per cent in May from a year earlier. Manufacturing, which accounts for four-fifths of industrial output, climbed 2.5 per cent, mining advanced 3.7 per cent and electricity gained 3.3 per cent.         
	The growth in the capital goods industry, however, dipped 3.6 per cent during the month.        
	Chawla said, Except for capital goods and non-durable consumer goods, the rest are certainly looking much better. I think we are back on track as was expected. The trend of growth will continue and the sectors which have seen a slight fall in growth will improve in the coming few months.        
	The governments optimism was echoed by economists.         
	Sherman Chan, an economist with Moodys Economy.com, wrote, Although industrial production appears to have bottomed out, an upward trend has appeared and a solid recovery may still be a few months away.        
	Sonal Varma, economist with Nomura, said, The positive numbers on consumer durables suggest that consumption continues to drive much of the recovery.                                
	 The slowdown in capital goods indicates that the investment cycle remains very subdued.         
	However, with consumption demand looking up, investments should follow with a lag. The big uncertainty remains the monsoon, the analyst cautioned.        
	We expect capital goods segment to pick up in the second half due to the fiscal stimulus given to infrastructure and the rural economy, Shubhada Rao, chief economist with Yes Bank said.        
	The government expects the economy to grow at around 7 percent in fiscal 2009-10, higher than the RBIs estimate of about 6 percent, as stimulus steps and the impact of previous policy easing take effect.        
	The global economic recession coupled with slowdown in industrial and farm production dragged the countrys overall growth to 6.7 per cent, from 9 per cent in the preceding three years.        
	Industrial production rose 2.6 percent in 2008-09, much lower than 8.5 percent in 2007-08, as economic crisis and high interest rates hurt domestic demand and exports.        
	Finance Minister Pranab Mukherjee in the budget has announced plans to revive growth to 9 per cent and promised more funding for welfare and infrastructure to push demand.

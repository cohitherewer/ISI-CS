          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Bhave: Time for change                                  
	Mumbai, Nov. 18: The capital market regulator plans to crunch the downtime for listing to seven days after a company closes its initial public offering (IPO).        
	At present, a company must list within 20 days after the issue closes.        
	C.B. Bhave, chairman of the Securities and Exchange Board of India, said the 20-day limit was unacceptable in todays market. The move is seen as an attempt to limit the frenzied speculation in the grey market that precedes every listing.        
	The delay of 20 days is a risk that investors carry, it is a risk that the issuers carry and this clearly has to be unacceptable in the market. Our aim is to see that we reduce this time to one week in about a years time, he said and added that the primary issuance process in India was not as efficient as the secondary market.        
	Over the past few years, the regulator had been undertaking various measures in the primary market aimed at speeding up the issue process and streamlining the allotment of shares.        
	Bhave recently said the market regulator was looking to bring down the allotment period in an IPO to five days from two weeks at present if the new system of payment for public issues that was seen during the NHPC issue gained popularity.        
	This system  called Application Supported by Blocked Amount (ASBA)  releases the applicants money only if the share allocation is made.        
	Similarly, in a bid to enable well established and compliant listed companies to access the Indian primary market through follow-on public offerings and rights issues, Sebi also introduced the concept of Fast Track Issues (FTIs) in November 2007.        
	Recently, the Sebi board decided to relax certain requirements of FTIs such as reducing the average market capitalisation of public shareholding of the issuer to Rs 5,000 crore from Rs 10,000 crore.        
	Bhave added that there was also a need to bring down the cost of mutual funds.         
	We need to look at reducing the cost of mutual funds and risk of investors, he said.

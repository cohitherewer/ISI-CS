                                                                                                               CBI seeks Raju custody
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Raju: More trouble                                  
	Hyderabad, March 3: The CBI, probing into the Satyam scam, today moved a local court for the custody of founder B. Ramalinga Raju, former managing director B. Rama Raju, ex-chief financial officer Srinivas Vadlamani and sacked Price Waterhouse partners S. Gopalakrishnan and Talluri Srinivas.        
	The CBI said the custody had been sought for 7 days.         
	At the hearing, the judge asked the CBIs public prosecutor to serve notices to the defence lawyers tomorrow.        
	As the CBI proceeded against the Rajus, the Satyam board evaluated the bidding norms for picking up a strategic investor.        
	Satyam will scrap the variable pay policy and introduce a revenue-linked allowance from next month for a section of associates to minimise cost.        
	In an email to its employees, CEO A.S. Murthy said, A revenue-linked allowance is being introduced effective April 1, 2009. This will only apply to associates working in approved billable roles and those who are allocated billable customer projects.        
	Billable projects are the ones where man-hours are billed as per specified milestones.        
	Murthy said the variable compensation policy would be withdrawn from April 1 for all associates across Satyam. However, the fixed compensation would continue undisturbed, he said.

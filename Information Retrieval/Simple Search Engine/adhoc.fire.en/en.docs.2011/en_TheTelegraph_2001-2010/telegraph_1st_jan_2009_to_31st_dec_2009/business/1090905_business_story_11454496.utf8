          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                                  
	Calcutta, Sept. 4: Frustrated with the slow progress of his twin greenfield projects in India, Lakshmi Niwas Mittal has done what he does best: acquire a company.        
	Uttam Galva Steels, one of Indias leading secondary steel producer, today informed stock exchanges that Mittal would become the co-promoter of the company, giving the worlds richest Indian a toehold in the local market.        
	According to the agreement, ArcelorMittal will acquire a stake equal to that of the current promoters  the Miglanis. Uttam Galva is currently valued at around Rs 1,300 crore.        
	The existing promoters hold about 40 per cent stake in Uttam Galva Steels and, based on the companys current market value, the promoters stake will be worth over Rs 500 crore.        
	While it did not elaborate on the exact size of the shareholding to be acquired by ArcelorMittal, Uttam Galva informed the stock exchanges that an open offer would be made by ArcelorMittal Netherlands BV.        
	Mittal, who grew up in Calcutta and now lives in London, has lined up two mammoth integrated steel projects worth $20 billion in Jharkhand and Orissa. The projects, announced in 2005 and 2007, respectively, were to be Mittals first attempt to build new plants as he had created the worlds largest steel company ArcelorMittal through a series of acquisitions over the years.        
	However, the plans have come a cropper so far. The company has not been able to acquire land either in Orissa or Jharkhand.        
	Mittal has also not been able to get enough coal and iron ore mining leases to meet the demand of the two plants, estimated to have a capacity of 12 million tonnes each.        
	The slow progress of the projects  similar issues ail the new projects of Tata Steel and Posco  in India has made Mittal unhappy.        
	He had openly vented his frustration of not being able to make much headway in India. Even the recent global downturn in the steel industry  ArcelorMittal has reported three straight quarterly losses  has not affected Mittals India plans.        
	Though Uttam Galva is not a substitute for the two projects in eastern India, it gives ArcelorMittal a direct manufacturing presence in India.         
	The acquisition will change the dynamics of Indias secondary steel sector, which produces cold roll (CR) and galvanised steel products (GP) used in the automobile and the consumer durables industries.        
	With the acquisition of Uttam Galva, no independent large size CR and GP maker now exists in India, a steel industry observer said.        
	Uttam Galva buys bulk of its raw material  hot rolled coils  from Ispat, owned by L.N. Mittals brothers, Pramod and Vinod Mittal.        
	Pledged shares        
	At the end of June, the Miglanis had pledged over 67 per cent of the 46.4 million shares they held in the galvanised steel maker with lenders, a situation that would have made them vulnerable to corporate predators.         
	The deal with ArcelorMittal will help them free the pledged shares but will also mean having to cede control of the 13-member board of directors, which includes two nominees of financial institutions.         
	Under the deal, the two sides  the Miglanis and the Mittals  will get to appoint the same number of directors.         
	The arrangement also confers a veto right to both sides on a list of matters subject to their maintaining a certain prescribed thresholds of shareholding.         
	The threshold wasnt spelt out in the notice to the stock exchanges.         
	ArcelorMittal will acquire equal number of shares as Miglanis through an open offer. In case the requisite number of shares are not received in the offer, Miglanis will sell their stake to have equal holding.

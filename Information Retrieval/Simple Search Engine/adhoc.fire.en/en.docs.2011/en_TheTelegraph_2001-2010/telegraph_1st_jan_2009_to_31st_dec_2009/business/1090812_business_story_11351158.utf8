The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Uniform gas price regime in pipeline
                                                                                                               Uniform gas price regime in pipeline
          R. SURYAMURTHY                          Pandey: Balancing act                                  
	New Delhi, Aug. 11: The government is considering a uniform pricing policy for natural gas in the wake of various supply disputes that saw Reliance Industries Ltd today filing a caveat in the Supreme Court seeking to be heard before it considers any petition by power producer NTPC.        
	A uniform gas price across the country is under the consideration of the government, but right now it is at a conceptual stage. GAIL (India) has been asked to study the viability of such a measure, R.S. Pandey, petroleum secretary, told The Telegraph.        
	A uniform price at the well-head gains significance following oil minister Murli Deoras recent statement in Parliament on the government-determined price for Reliances Krishna-Godavari gas being less than the price charged by other operators.        
	Mukesh Ambanis Reliance Industries is engaged in a bitter legal battle with brother Anils Reliance Natural Resources Limited (RNRL), with the latter demanding the use of KG gas at $2.34 million British thermal unit (mBtu) against the government price of $4.2.        
	Meanwhile, Reliance Industries today filed the caveat in the Supreme Court in the event of NTPC moving the apex court.        
	State-owned NTPC is expected to file a petition challenging last months Bombay High Court order allowing Reliance to amend its plea in its dispute with the power player.        
	In a related development, the oil ministry today said that it was not favouring Reliance in the gas dispute with RNRL and had intervened in the dispute to protect the gas utilisation policy which, it said, got precedence over any family agreement.        
	The ministry was responding to comments sought by the PMO on a letter by Anil Ambani. RNRL, reacting to the ministrys reply, said that it was intentionally and deliberately misleading the PMO.

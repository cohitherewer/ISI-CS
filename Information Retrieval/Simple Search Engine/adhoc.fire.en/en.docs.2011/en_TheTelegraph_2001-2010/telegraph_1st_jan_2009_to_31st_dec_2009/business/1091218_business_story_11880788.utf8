          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                            
	Mumbai, Dec. 17: Reliance Industries is the biggest wealth creator in the country  a feat that it has achieved for three years in a row.        
	Motilal Oswals 14th Annual Wealth Creation Study (2004-09), which was released today, says Mukesh Ambanis flagship firm is likely to retain its pole position over several years as it pursues exploration and production activity.        
	In contrast, brother Anil Ambanis Reliance Infrastructure ranks among the top 10 wealth destroyers along with Tata Motors, Tata Steel, ICICI Bank and scam-scarred Satyam Computer.        
	The study says RILs closest competitor  Bharti Airtel  faces sector headwinds as it fights to retain its place in the wealth creation stakes.        
	Six firms have figured in the top 10 wealth creators for three consecutive years: RIL, Bharti, ONGC, Bhel, Larsen amp; Toubro (L amp;T) and SAIL.        
	Raamdeo Agrawal, managing director of Motilal Oswal Group, outlined a winning formula for wealth creation in the years ahead.        
	He said while India would add its next trillion dollar of GDP in 5-6 years, this achievement would throw up several winning categories.        
	With the middle class ranks swelling and discretionary spends showing a sharp jump, the study said there would be a significant rise in the consumption of alcoholic beverages, transport vehicles, healthcare services, education and recreation, and communications.        
	According to Motilal Oswal, the model portfolio that can be looked at during the next trillion dollar era includes Hero Honda, Maruti Suzuki, Mahindra amp; Mahindra, Bhel, L amp;T, HDFC Bank, the State Bank of India, Dabur India, Nestle India and Mundra Port.        
	However, the financial services firm has a cautious view on stock markets over the next 12 months. Agrawal said corporate profits to GDP had bottomed out and should hit new highs in the next 4-5 years on the back of sustained economic performance.        
	This should reflect in better earnings per share (EPS) for the sensex, which is likely to show a growth of 15-20 per cent in 2010-11 after having shown negative growth from 2008-2010.         
	According to Agrawal, Despite the expected sensex EPS growth of over 25 per cent in 2010-11, the markets are unlikely to cross earlier peak of 21000 in the next 12 months.         
	Inflation concerns, strong pipeline of issuances and current rich valuation will cap significant market upmove, despite fairly healthy earnings outlook, he said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Stock bias in pension push
                                                                                                               Stock bias in pension push
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Money matters                                  
	New Delhi, Feb. 17: An expert group, appointed by the pension regulator, has proposed that employees of private firms can choose to invest their entire contribution in an equity index fund.        
	The recommendation comes at a time when equities worldwide are charred by the recession fire.         
	If an employee is silent on the investment choice, the panel feels that 65 per cent of the contribution should be invested in equity indexes. The fund manager will consider the default option as the preferred one if employees do not choose any option.        
	Officials, however, felt that such ambitious investment options recommended by the panel, headed by Deepak Parekh, was likely to be rejected by the government and the pension regulator.         
	The governments plan is to extend the defined pension scheme for civil servants to employees in the organised and unorganised sectors. For the mandarins, the riskiest option under the pension scheme is a mere 5 per cent investment in stocks.        
	Other options proposed by the Parekh panel include a cocktail of investments in government bonds, bank deposits, liquid mutual funds, blue chip corporate bonds and equity indexes. The scheme defines investment in government securities as G, debt as C and equity funds as E, with subscribers choosing the mix. The Parekh committee today submitted the report to the Pension Fund Regulatory and Development Authority (PFRDA).         
	Under the default option, 65 per cent of the pension sum will be in equity indexes, 10 per cent in government bonds and the rest in corporate bonds. This option will remain valid till the contributor turns 36 years, after which the investment will change in favour of safer debt papers.        
	The problem with such a complex default option is that many of the estimated 80 million people are illiterate and semi-literate having limited awareness.        
	Finance ministry officials said it was unlikely that the government would accept the more ambitious options. Rather, the plan may be similar to the one for the civil servants. No one wants controversies ahead of an election, they said.        
	We will announce the investment norms before the end of this month which will be applicable to all citizens other than government staff, said D. Swarup, chairman of the PFRDA.        
	A meeting of the regulator is scheduled on February 19. It has already shortlisted six fund managers.

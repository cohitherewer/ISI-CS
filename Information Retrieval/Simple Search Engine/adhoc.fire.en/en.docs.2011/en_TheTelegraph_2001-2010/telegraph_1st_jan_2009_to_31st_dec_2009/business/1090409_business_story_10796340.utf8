                                                                                                               StanChart eyes RBS assets
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, April 8: UK-based Standard Chartered Bank has submitted its expression of interest to buy the retail and commercial banking assets of the Royal Bank of Scotland in Asia, which includes the Indian operations.        
	We have expressed interest for RBS Asia, said Jaspal Bindra, chief executive officer (Asia) of Standard Chartered. As far as we know, we are still bidders. But it is a long way before we get close to any decision, he said.         
	Edinburgh-based RBS is present in India through 31 branches and has 10,000 employees following the acquisition of the Asian operations of ABN Amro Bank in 2007.         
	StanChart recently acquired American Express Bank, which gave it access to seven more branches in the country. At present, Standard Chartered has 90 branches across 33 cities in the country.        
	According to sources, StanChart has received an information memorandum from RBS, which has classified financial details on ABN Amros Asian business.        
	RBS has also sent the memorandum to two other prospective buyers  Australia and New Zealand Banking Group and HSBC. This information will help the three suitors understand the health of the British bank before they submit bids.        
	According to an investment banker, RBS has classified the buyers into three categories.         
	The first category include those who have shown interest in buying the entire Asian operations. There are others who are willing to buy the entire assets of ABN Amro Bank, including the global banking and markets business that RBS considers as core business and is not for sale. Finally, there are banks keen to buy the assets in specific countries.        
	Investment bank Morgan Stanley has got the RBS mandate to look for a buyer for its retail and commercial banking assets across Asia.        
	India is the most attractive market in RBSs Asian business and the Reserve Bank of India will have a say on the profile of the buyer.

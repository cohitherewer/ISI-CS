	New Delhi, April 24: Maruti Suzuki India today recorded a 29.6 per cent decline in net profit at Rs 1,217 crore for fiscal 2008-09 on account of sluggish sales, forex losses and high input prices.        
	For the quarter ended March 31, 2009, the countrys largest car maker recorded an 18.33 per cent fall in net profit.        
	Maruti plans to invest Rs 1,800 crore in the current fiscal on launches, plant upgradation and other operational activities. In the last fiscal, it had invested Rs 1,600 crore. The companys new model, the Ritz, will be launched next month.        
	For the March quarter, net sales stood at Rs 6,308.35 crore, up 32.45 per cent, against Rs 4,762.91 crore in the same period last fiscal. Net sales rose 14.19 per cent to Rs 21,776.84 crore in financial year 2008-09 over the previous fiscal.        
	The auto industry faced a lot of challenges in fiscal 2008-09 due to lack of retail financing, increased commodity prices and foreign exchange fluctuations, said Shinzo Nakanishi, managing director of Maruti Suzuki India.         
	The company suffered a loss of Rs 121 crore on account of foreign exchange fluctuations during the fiscal, said chief financial officer Ajay Seth.        
	Though commodity prices have started softening in the past couple of months, the effect would be felt only in the first quarter of 2009-10.         
	To counter the losses from forex fluctuations, the company is also looking at greater localisation.         
	Ford show        
	Ford Motor Co has reported a smaller-than-expected first-quarter loss of $1.43 billion compared with a net income of $70 million a year ago.        
	The company said it was on track to at least break even in 2011 and did not expect to seek US government loans, sending its shares up more than 22 per cent.

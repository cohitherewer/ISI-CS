          GARIMA SINGH NEOGY                              
	New Delhi, Dec. 27: Riding on launches and increased production, the scooter industry is growing at the rate of 15-17 per cent annually.        
	Major players such as Honda, Suzuki, TVS, Mahindra-Kinetic and Hero Honda have ramped up capacities and come up with new models.        
	Market leader Honda Motorcycle amp; Scooter India (HMSI) upped the production of scooters by 27 per cent on increased demand. The companys third assembly line was opened on November 1.        
	Chennai-based TVS Motor, makers of the gearless Scooty, launched the 110cc scooterette Wego last month. The Wego is priced on a par with Hondas top selling Activa.        
	Mahindra Two Wheelers, part of the $6.3-billion Mahindra group, said it was getting a good response to its recent foray.         
	In September, the company launched two power scooters  Duro and Rodeo.        
	Sanjay Mittal, vice-president (sales and customer care) of Mahindra Two Wheelers, said the company had been selling 7,000 units on an average per month. Mittal expects sales to grow 15-20 per cent every month for the next six months.        
	With the introduction of the Rodeo and Duro, we have created a new segment for power scooters in India. Both models offer the comfort and convenience of a scooter along with the thrill and power of a motorcycle, said Anoop Mathur, president of Mahindra Two Wheelers.        
	Scooter makers say the market for automatic models is expected to touch two million units over the next five years at a growth rate of 10 per cent per annum.        
	The surge in demand has lengthened the waiting period.        
	For Honda scooters, the waiting period is more than two months. Six months back, it was just 10 days. The company hopes to bring down the waiting period to one-two months by ramping up production.        
	Naresh Rattan, HMSIs divisional head (sales and marketing), says the company has priced its new 110cc bikes on par with its scooter. However, the company does not see any adverse impact on scooter sales as people are ready to pay a high price for our scooters.        
	The demand for Activa, Aviator and Dio (its range of automatic scooters) has forced us to increase production to 2,800 units per day from 2,200 units. About 65 per cent of our current production are for scooters, Rattan said.        
	Japans Yamaha expects to give HMSI competition with the launch of its automatic models next year.        
	Hero Honda is selling over 16,000 of its newly launched automatic scooter, Pleasure, every month.        
	Bajaj Auto, however, will exit the scooter business by the end of this fiscal.

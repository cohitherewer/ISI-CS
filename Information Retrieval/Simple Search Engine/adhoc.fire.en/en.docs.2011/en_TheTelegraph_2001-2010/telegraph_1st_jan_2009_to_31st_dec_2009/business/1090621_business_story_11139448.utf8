The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Recovery in six months
                                                                                                               Recovery in six months
                                  
	Pune, June 20 (PTI): Suresh Tendulkar, the Prime Ministers economic adviser, today predicted that the economy would recover in the next six months.        
	After the return of the UPA government at the Centre with a comfortable margin, the prospects of political and economic stability have further improved the outlook for an early recovery during the next six months, he said at a convocation ceremony of the National Institute of Bank Management here.        
	The slowdown has been offset in varying degrees by rapid changes in monetary policy rates and deployment of other monetary packages in December 2008, January 2009 and again after the interim budget in February, he said.         
	Public sector banks are slowly lowering their lending rates, he added.

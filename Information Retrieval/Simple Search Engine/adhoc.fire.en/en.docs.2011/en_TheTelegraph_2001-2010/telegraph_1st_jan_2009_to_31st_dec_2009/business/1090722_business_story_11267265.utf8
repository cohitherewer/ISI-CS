The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Bengal power man at selloff helm
                                                                                                               Bengal power man at selloff helm
          OUR BUREAU                          Mitra: Big challenge                                  
	New Delhi/Calcutta, July 21: Bengal power secretary Sunil Mitra will be the disinvestment secretary in the finance ministry.        
	Mitra, an IAS officer of the 1975 batch, will replace Rahul Khullar, who has moved from the disinvestment department to take charge as commerce secretary.        
	The Appointments Committee of the Cabinet has approved the name of Sunil Mitra as secretary in the department of disinvestment under the ministry of finance, an official release said.        
	Mitra had served as secretary, Public Enterprises and Industrial Reconstruction, for more than eight years in Bengal.         
	Officials said Mitra had been handpicked by finance minister Pranab Mukherjee as he had formulated and adopted a divestment policy for 26 PSUs in Bengal.        
	Among these 26 PSUs, the non-viable ones were closed, while some units were revived through financial restructuring. In some others, the governments holding was offloaded to the extent of 74 per cent to strategic partners.        
	Mitra is also behind the corporatisation and the revival of the century-old Calcutta Stock Exchange.        
	Mitra seemed quite pleased with the new portfolio though he had wished for the power secretarys post in the Union government. People may want to be somewhere but they may end up being somewhere else, he said.         
	The post of the divestment secretary was lying vacant since Rahul Khullar moved to the commerce ministry in June this year to replace G.K. Pillai, who became home secretary. H.S. Brahma became the power secretary in May.        
	Mitra, however, didnt want to discuss his plans for the new job before formally getting the joining order. Let me get the official order first, he said. The government is expected to issue the appointment letter on Wednesday.        
	The finance ministrys road map on divestment in public sector units would be brought out in 3-4 weeks. However, there would be no strategic sale as the government would retain a 51 per cent stake. The divestment programme will kick off with the dilution of government equity in listed entities, where public holding is less.

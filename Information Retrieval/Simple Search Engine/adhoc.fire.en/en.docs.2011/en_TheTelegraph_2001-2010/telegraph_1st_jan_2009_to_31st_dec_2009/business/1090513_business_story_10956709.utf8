The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Auditor to pore over Airtel books
                                                                                                               Auditor to pore over Airtel books
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                          Under scanner                                  
	New Delhi, May 12: The department of telecom today appointed an independent auditor to inspect Bharti Airtels books. The auditor will examine allegations of irregular revenue reporting by Bharti to pay lower taxes to the government.        
	Contractor Nayak amp; Kishnadwala has been appointed the special auditor. The auditor will check if the revenues were being declared correctly, said DoT officials.        
	The accounting firm would also look into whether there had been any cross-booking of revenue for 2006-07 and 2007-08 from wireless segments to other telecom subsidiaries which were not liable to pay a licence fee, they said.        
	The auditor is approved by the Comptroller and Auditor General based on directions from the Central Vigilance Commission. Such special audits would be undertaken once every 3-5 years to prevent any loss to the exchequer, said officials.        
	The DoTs action comes after the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India found a shift in Bhartis revenues to the long-distance segment, which attracts only 6 per cent licence fee against a maximum of 10 per cent in mobile services.         
	Higher revenue share would have meant that the tax burden on Bharti would go up.        
	To clear Trais doubt, it was suggested that we get the special audit of the licensee company done, said an internal DoT note.        
	Bhartis spokesperson said, As a responsible corporate house, Bharti Airtel has always strictly adhered to the regulatory processes.

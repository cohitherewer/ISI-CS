          JAYANTA ROY CHOWDHURY                              
	New Delhi, Aug. 25: The government may offer shares of three more power utilities  REC, NTPC and Satluj Jal Vidyut Nigam  to the public.         
	Top officials said the government could sell 4.5 per cent of its stake in REC (Rural Electrification Corporation Limited), besides allowing the power finance firm to issue new shares to the extent of 10 per cent of its equity. Hydel power PSU NHPC had made a public offer a fortnight ago. The government could give permission to NTPC to issue new shares, which will see its stake falling nearly 5 per cent.         
	Since NTPC is a navratna company, the government cannot sell its stake in the thermal power firm and has rejected an earlier bid to do so.         
	However, the officials said, a follow-on offer comprising just new shares is an option. The government now holds 89.50 per cent in the company.        
	The Centre also plans to sell 10 per cent of its 25 per cent holding in Satluj Jal Vidyut Nigam Limited, a profit-making joint venture with the Himachal Pradesh government from which it is keen to withdraw.        
	According to the officials, the issue of new shares in NTPC can fetch the power utility about Rs 8,000 crore. Shares of NTPC rose Rs 3.50 to Rs 210.40 today. The scrip has risen by Rs 8.40 from Fridays close of Rs 202.        
	NTPC, Indias largest power generator with an installed capacity of over 30,000MW, needs money to increase production by 22,430MW by the end of the 11th plan period (March 2012). NTPCs profit after tax for 2008-09 was Rs 8,201 crore compared with Rs 7,415 crore in 2007-08, an increase of 10.61 per cent.        
	REC, which provides loans to state power utilities for rural electrification, could dilute the governments 81.8 per cent stake in it through a follow-on offer of fresh equity of 4.5 per cent of its stake along with a 10 per cent sale of government holding.         
	The proceeds of the 10 per cent stake sale will go to the National Investment Fund. RECs stock price rose Rs 6.20 to Rs 210.55 on the BSE on Tuesday. The firm made a profit of Rs 1,922 crore in 2008-09 compared with Rs 1,325 crore in 2007-08.        
	Besides NHPC, the government has allowed Oil India Ltd to come out with a public issue.         
	However, sources said, it has been going slow on big-ticket divestments and modifying the rules governing the National Investment Fund, fearing objections from the DMK and Trinamul Congress. Money garnered through the sale of PSU stakes has to be deposited in the National Investment Fund, which now has a mere Rs 994 crore.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | GM India stays upbeat
                                                                                                               GM India stays upbeat

	New Delhi, April 7: GM India today said the poor financial health of its US parent would not affect its operations.        
	The Indian operations are intact and running smoothly. About Rs 5,000 crore has already been invested here and we have a strong employee strength of 4,000. The company has just inaugurated its second plant at Talegaon and construction at the engine-manufacturing facility is also going on in full swing, P. Balendran, director and vice-president (corporate affairs), GM India told The Telegraph.        
	News agency Reuters today said General Motors Corp (of the US) was in intense and earnest preparations for a possible bankruptcy filing.        
	A plan to split the corporation into a new company made up of the most successful units, and an old one of its less-profitable units, is gaining momentum and is seen as the most sensible configuration.        
	GM India, however, said all its product development programmes in India were self-funded and required no financial aid from its parent.        
	It plans to grow through product launches at regular intervals.         
	The company plans to introduce its compact sedan the Chevrolet Cruz in the second half of 2009, which is likely to be priced between Rs 12 lakh and Rs 14 lakh.        
	After the success of its small car brands such as the Spark and Aveo U-VA, GM India will launch a mini car priced approximately at Rs 4 lakh by the end of this year.        
	But speculations are rife about its viability, if the US parent files for bankruptcy.        
	A filing under the bankruptcy code will protect General Motors from creditors, while it restructures operations under court supervision.        
	However, GM India officials and auto analysts are optimistic about the companys sales and operations and said it was very self-contained.        
	GM India has already made huge investments here and these are largely from their internal accruals. Also, the Indian subsidiary is more aligned to GMs Korean operations. There are no products or technology the company is borrowing right now from either its US or European counterpart, auto analyst Hormazd Sorabji said.        
	Abdul Majeed, an analyst with PricewaterhouseCoopers said, All investments are committed and so we dont foresee any impact.

                                                                                                               SBI trims deposit rates
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                            
	Mumbai, Oct. 1: The State Bank of India today cut deposit rates by 25 basis points across all maturities to protect margins at a time when lending rates are ruling low.         
	The revised rate structure will be effective from Monday. This is the fourth reduction by the countrys biggest bank in the last few months.         
	The SBI will now offer an interest rate of 2.75 per cent on deposits with a maturity bucket of 15-45 days against 3 per cent earlier. Interest rate on deposits of 46-90 days will be 3.75 per cent, while for 91-180 days it will be 5 per cent.         
	Rates on deposits with a tenure of 181 days to less than 1 year, 1 year to less than 2 years and 2 years to less than 3 years, will be 5.75 per cent, 6.25 per cent and 6.75 per cent, respectively.        
	For deposits of 3 years to less than 5 years, the interest rate has been brought down to 7 per cent from 7.25 per cent and for those with a tenure of 5 years to less than 8 years, it will be 7.25 per cent. For deposits of 8-10 years, the revised rate stands at 7.50 per cent.        
	According to analysts, frequent deposit rate reduction by the SBI should be seen in the context of the bank going aggressive on the asset side. Since February, the PSU bank has come out with attractive interest rates on home and car loans to lure customers.        
	Therefore, the current reduction in deposit rates must have been done to protect its net interest margins, an analyst, who did not wish to be identified, said.

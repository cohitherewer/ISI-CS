The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | New ministerial panel to frame rules for RIL gas allocation
                                                                                                               New ministerial panel to frame rules for RIL gas allocation
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Petroleum minister Murli Deora in New Delhi on Monday. (PTI)                                  
	New Delhi, Aug. 31: The government will soon form a ministerial panel to allocate the increased natural gas flowing from Reliance Industries Limiteds KG D-6 field to new customers.        
	Petroleum minister Murli Deora, who yesterday met T.K.A. Nair, principal secretary to the Prime Minister, has written to cabinet secretary K.M. Chandrasekhar for the reconstitution of the panel.         
	Oil secretary R.S. Pandey said the group would allocate gas from the basin once Reliance started producing more than 40 million cubic meters per day (mcmd).        
	Pricing is not an issue as the (previous) eGoM has already set a gas price for five years, Pandey said.         
	The previous eGoM (empowered group of ministers) had allocated the first 40 mcmd of gas from KG-D6 to fertiliser, power and city gas companies, LPG plants and the steel sector. RIL can, however, now produce close to 60 mcmd.        
	RILs petroleum business chief P.M.S. Prasad said the firm was supplying 37 mcmd of gas to customers identified by the government. However, NTPC, Dabhol, Essar and GAIL, who have been allocated gas by the eGoM, have not yet drawn a single unit so far, he said.        
	NTPC, which was allocated 2.7 mcmd, is yet to sign a contract, while Ratnagiri Gas and Power  owner of Dabhol  has signed a contract for 2.7 mcmd but has not begun drawing gas yet. Essar and GAIL between them are expected to start taking 4 mcmd next month, Prasad said.        
	Accounts check        
	The petroleum ministry will ensure unfettered access to the accounts of private oil and gas contractors to the Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG), which had earlier expressed ire over the attitude of some of the operators. In a letter written to the CAG, Vinod Rai, Deora said: We have already given direction to the contractors to make available all materials sought by the CAG.

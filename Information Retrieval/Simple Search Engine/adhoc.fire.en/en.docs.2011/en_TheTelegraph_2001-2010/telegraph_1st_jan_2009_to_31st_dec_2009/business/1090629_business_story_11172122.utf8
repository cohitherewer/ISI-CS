                                                                                                               New price index by September
                            
	New Delhi, June 28 (PTI): The government will come out with a new index by September that will detect much wider price movements and provide a more reliable picture of wholesale price inflation.        
	The new index will be more comprehensive. There will be more quotations and it will be released in the next two to three months, a senior commerce ministry official said.         
	The trial run for the new index has started and data were being captured, he said. The data collection started with 1,100 items, which would eventually be reduced to 850-900 articles.        
	At present, the wholesale price index comprises 435 articles with the base year 1993-94 for calculating the price series.        
	The new index will have 2004-05 as the base year and items such as mobile phones, laptops and several electronic goods have been included to make the basket relevant in the current scenario. The department of industrial policy and promotion will soon seek the approval of the working group headed by Planning Commission member Abhijit Sen and place it before the government for clearance.

          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Nov. 24: The Central Bureau of Investigation today caught Company Law Board member R. Vasudevan while accepting a bribe of Rs 7 lakh from one Manoj Banthia.        
	The CBI has caught red-handed a member of the CLB, New Delhi for demanding and accepting a bribe of Rs 7 lakh from a company secretary (appearing as a counsel) at his official residence. The company secretary was also caught while delivering illegal gratification, said the CBI in a statement issued today.        
	The accused demanded illegal gratification to give favourable orders in a case being presided over by him, the statement added.         
	Senior CBI officials said, We were tipped off about this by our sources. This is the first time a member of the quasi-judicial body has been arrested for graft.         
	Vasudevan is also the acting chairman of the CLB following the resignation of S. Balasubrananiam. He was later produced before a court, which remanded him in CBI custody for six days.        
	While leaving the premises of the CLB after the raid, CBI sources told The Telegraph, The case is being fought by a media company.         
	Sources said Vasudevan, who had been one of the investigating officers in the Rs 7,100-crore Satyam scam, has not had a good reputation for a long time.        
	He may be involved in other cases too, the sources said. Vasudevan had earlier served as the regional director of the registrar of companies in Chennai and as director, investigation and inspection at the ministry of company affairs.        
	A CBI spokesperson said: Rs 55 lakh, including a Rs 7 lakh bribe amount, has been recovered from the residence of the accused member of the Company Law Board besides Rs 3 lakh in cash from the possession of the company secretary.         
	The CBI has registered a case under different sections of the Indian Penal Code and the Prevention of Corruption Act and carried out searches at seven locations in Calcutta, Delhi and Chennai.        
	Incriminating documents recovered during searches from the premises of the accused persons are being scrutinised, the official said.        
	After registering a case on the basis of information given by its sources, the CBI started monitoring the activities of Vasudevan.         
	During their monitoring, they claimed to have got the information that he would be handed over money to the tune of Rs 7 lakh by a company secretary to give a favourable order, the sources said.        
	Searches are still going on and further investigation is in progress, the CBI spokesperson said.

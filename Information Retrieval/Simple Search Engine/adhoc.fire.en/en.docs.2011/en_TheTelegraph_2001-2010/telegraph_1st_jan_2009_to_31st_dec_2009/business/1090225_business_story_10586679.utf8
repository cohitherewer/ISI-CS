The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | LIC raises stake in ICICI Bank
                                                                                                               LIC raises stake in ICICI Bank
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                               
	Mumbai, Feb. 24: The Life Insurance Corporation of India has increased its stake in ICICI Bank to 9.38 per cent by purchasing shares worth Rs 145.62 crore through open market transcations.         
	The LICs move comes at a time when investors are shunning bank stocks on fears of economic slowdown and rising non-performing assets.         
	In a communication to the Bombay Stock Exchange, ICICI Bank said the LIC had purchased over 2.27 crore shares for Rs 145.62 crore, representing a 2.04 per cent stake.         
	Prior to the purchase, the LIC held 7.34 per cent in the bank. The insurance giant now owns over 10.44 crore shares. The LIC had recently said its investments in the equity markets could touch Rs 30,000 crore this fiscal.         
	Indias No.1 life insurer has also been raising stakes in other companies. GAIL (India) said the big brother of insurance had purchased over 5.92 crore shares representing two per cent stake in the company between March 21, 2007 and February 13 this year.         
	The LIC bought 7.38 crore shares of GAIL worth Rs 1,132.97 crore and sold 1.46 crore shares for Rs 546.77 crore, which resulted in the net acquisition of 5.92 crore shares, out of which, over 3.88 crore were bonus shares. This took the LICs holding to around 9.98 per cent.         
	It has also raised its holding in Indian Overseas Bank to 7.09 per cent, an increase of 2 per cent.         
	The stake purchase comes at a time when ambiguities regarding the LICs holding in some companies have been resolved.         
	Recently, the Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority had allowed the LIC to hold more than the prescribed 10 per cent stake in listed companies.         
	The regulator laid out the condition that in cases where its holding was more than 10 per cent, the corporation could hold on to the stake at least temporarily. However, the LIC cannot raise its stake in a company above 10 per cent if the holding is in single digits at present.

          OUR CORRESPONDENT                                    
	New Delhi, Aug. 17: The Serious Frauds Investigation Office (SFIO) may conduct a second inquiry into the dealings of Satyam Computer Services Limited.         
	The ministry of corporate affairs is likely to give the SFIO time till October 13, 2009 to submit its detailed report, ministry officials said.         
	It will discuss the entire findings of the SFIO report with the law ministry and prosecution will take place after the latters approval.        
	Another round of investigation would give the SFIO enough time to track the trail of funds, bank account details and other statements of some 123 companies of the Raju family that were in the land business, said the officials.        
	In May, the SFIO  the investigative arm of the MCA  had submitted its initial report that mentioned numerous violations of company law by the Hyderabad-based IT services company, whose promoter B. Ramalinga Raju had confessed to a Rs 7,100-crore accounting fraud in January.        
	However, the report had not been able to provide sufficient proof of siphoning off or diversion of funds.         
	The government needs additional proof if it plans to prosecute the promoters, the chief financial officer, the company secretary, the auditors and a few independent directors of Satyam.        
	The initial SFIO report had raised questions on various issues such as the integrity of the auditors, use of the ADS (American Depositary Share)funds, sustenance of certain other outfits floated by Satyams promoters and dividend payout mechanism followed by Satyam at Rajus time.         
	Ministry officials said a second investigation would cover all loopholes in the case.

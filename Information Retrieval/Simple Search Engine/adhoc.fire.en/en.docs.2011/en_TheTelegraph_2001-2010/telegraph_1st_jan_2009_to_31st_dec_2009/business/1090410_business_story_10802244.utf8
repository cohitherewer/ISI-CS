	New Delhi, April 9: Factory output shrank to 1.2 per cent in February  the third straight month of decline  but analysts took heart from consumer and capital goods growth.  
	Stimulus packages in the form of lower excise and value-added taxes have whetted firms appetite for capacity expansion, reflected in 10.4 per cent growth in capital goods, or machine, production.        
	Cheap finance saw consumer durables sales rise 5.7 per cent compared with 3.1 per cent in the same period last year.         
	The data indicate that the downturn in industrial production has bottomed out and we could see positive numbers soon, said N.R. Bhanumurthy of the Institute of Economic Growth.         
	The contraction in industrial output in February followed a 21.7 per cent fall in exports in the same month.         
	Economic affairs secretary Ashok Chawla said, Sectors dependant on exports such as textiles and leather are performing poorly. Mining is not doing well because of the lower demand for ores.        
	Sonal Varma, an economist at Nomura, said the pick-up in consumer durables and capital goods is a positive sign.         
	Videocon chairman Venugopal Dhoot said, Sales of consumer durables are picking up and will help industry recover.        
	According to Yashika Singh of Dun amp; Bradstreet, The IIP data points to buoyancy in investment proposals in the last quarter of the previous fiscal, which may provide some cushion to production.         
	Both the government and the Reserve Bank of India have provided reliefs to beat the slowdown brought about by the global financial crisis.

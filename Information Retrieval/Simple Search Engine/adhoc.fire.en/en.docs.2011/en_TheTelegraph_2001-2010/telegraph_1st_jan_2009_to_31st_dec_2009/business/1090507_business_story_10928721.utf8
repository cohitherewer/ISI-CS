                                                                                                               Cell newbies clear air on shareholding
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                          OWNERSHIP MATTERS                                  
	New Delhi, May 6: Mobile newcomers Loop Telecom and Swan Telecom have said that their shareholding patterns conformed to government guidelines.        
	The government had sought clarifications on Essars holding in Loop and Reliance Telecoms in Swan. Vodafone Essar and Reliance Telecoms parent Reliance Communications are established players in the business.        
	Loop Telecom has submitted its certified shareholding pattern to the department of telecom (DoT), stating that the Essar group has less than 9.99 per cent equity in the firm.        
	In a letter to the DoT, Loop Telecom said, Since the relevant date (date of application), the indirect equity holding of the Essar group in Loop Telecom has at no point exceeded 9.99 per cent as permitted under the licensing guidelines.        
	Essar owns a 9.9 per cent stake in BPL Mobile (now Loop Mobile), which operates only in Mumbai. Loop Telecom is a majority-owned unit of Loop Mobile.        
	Loops clarification comes after the ministry of corporate affairs asked the DoT to examine the shareholding structure of the company in the wake of various financial transactions between the Essar group and the holding companies of Loop Telecom.        
	According to the ministry, the transactions could imply that the Ruias of Essar were seeking control of Loop, which was against the guidelines.        
	Loop also stated that the investments made by Essar in its non-convertible debentures did not give any voting or conversion rights to the latter. Therefore, the shareholding structure is fully compliant with relevant guidelines, said the telecom firm.        
	The corporate affairs ministry is also investigating any possible links between Swan Telecom and R-Com.        
	Swan Telecom, owned by the Mumbai-based Dynamix Balwas group, told the DoT that the 9.9 per cent equity stake of Anil Ambani-owned Reliance Telecomhad been divested before obtaining a telecom licence. Post divestment, Tiger Trustee Private Limited held 90.10 per cent, while Delphi Investments Limited (a foreign company) had 9.8 per cent, said Swan.         
	The preferential shares earlier held by Reliance Telecom were now with Dynamix Balwas Infrastructure.

        Subhash Lakhotia offers tips on how to give gifts                                            
	Gifts  the very mention of the word brings a smile to every face. It always feels great to receive gifts from dear ones, while giving gifts is equally satisfying.         
	However, it could help to be aware of the tax implications related to making or receiving gifts.         
	Make your pick        
	You have numerous options to choose from while selecting a gift  cheque, cash, bank draft, transfer of bonds, shares and other movable assets.        
	You can also gift an immovable property  a piece of land, a shop, a farm house or an apartment owned by you.        
	In the case of movable assets, all you need to do is to write a letter on a plain paper to the person whom you want to gift giving details of the asset. You can also prepare a gift deed on a stamp paper.        
	For an immovable property, you have to prepare a gift deed and get it registered, according to the Transfer of Property Act.        
	At the receiving end        
	While donors are free to give gifts of their choice, the income tax act imposes certain curbs on the recipients.        
	Under Section 56 of the income tax act, a cash gift of less than Rs 50,000 will be tax-free. But if the amount is more than Rs 50,000, the entire sum will be taxed. However, the section states that gifts received from the following will not attract any income tax:         
	 from any relative        
	 on the occasion of marriage of the recipient        
	 under a will or by way of inheritance        
	from any local authority (clause (20) of Section 10)        
	 from any foundation or university or hospital or institution referred to in clause (23C) of Section 10; or        
	 from any trust registered under Section 12AA.        
	However, if a person receives property as gift from a friend there shall be no tax liability on the recipient.        
	Tax relief        
	If taxpayers transfer part of their income either through gifts or loans to relatives who have no tax liability, they can considerably reduce the tax burden of the entire family.        
	The income from gifts/loans will be taxed in the accounts of donees, who are non-taxpayers. Tax on such income would, thus, be nil or much lower than the taxpaying member.        
	Clubbing claws        
	Under section 64 of the income tax act, income of the spouse, minor children and daughter-in-law is clubbed with the individual income tax assessee under certain conditions.         
	If one wants to give some money to ones spouse in the form of a bank fixed deposit, the interest income from such deposits will accrue in the name of the recipient, but it will be clubbed with the donors income.        
	Similarly, if one transfers a house in the name of the spouse without adequate consideration, any income from that property will be clubbed with the donors income.         
	Indirect transfers of assets also attract the clubbing provision. This is meant to cover cases where assets are transferred by setting up trusts or cross transfers.         
	Consider another instance where one gifts some money to ones spouse or daughter-in-law or a minor child and the money is used to buy a property or shares of a company.         
	If the property or the shares are sold and the proceeds are invested in a bank fixed deposit in the name of the spouse/ daughter-in-law/minor child, the capital gains from the sale of the property as well as the interest income from the bank fixed deposit will be clubbed with the donors income.        
	The way out        
	It would, thus, be wise to give a loan instead of a gift to the daughter-in-law and wife. However, one must charge an interest that can be at a discount to the market rate.         
	The wife or the daughter-in-law can invest the money in business, buying shares or mutual funds or jewellery. Any income from such investments will be considered as personal income of the recipient and wont be clubbed with the donors income.         
	In the case of a minor, one can buy a life insurance, open a PPF account on his/her behalf or gift units of mutual funds or shares.         
	The advantages of opening a life insurance or a PPF account is that the income from these instruments are exempted under Section 10 of the income tax act. The benefit of mutual fund units or equities is that long-term capital gains tax on these is nil.         
	Even the dividend income from diversified equity schemes of mutual funds is tax-free.

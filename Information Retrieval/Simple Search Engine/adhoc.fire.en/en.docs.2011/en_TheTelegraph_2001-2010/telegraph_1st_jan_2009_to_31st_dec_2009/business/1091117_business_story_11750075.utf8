	New Delhi, Nov. 16: National Thermal Power Corporation Ltd (NTPC) has been permitted to use a gas swap arrangement to help its Kawas and Gandhar power plants in Gujarat  which are at the centre of a celebrated court battle with Reliance Industries  out of a sticky situation.        
	The empowered group of ministers has permitted NTPC to divert gas from Reliance Industries Krishna-Godavari field that were earmarked for the two Gujarat plants to three other plants owned by the state-owned utility in Anta (Rajasthan), Faridabad (Haryana) and Dadri (Uttar Pradesh).        
	In exchange, the three northern plants will supply 2.71 million standard cubic metres of gas a day (mmscmd) to the Kawas and Gandhar power projects that they were sourcing from the Panna, Mukta and Tapti fields as well as certain other fields operated by state-owned companies.        
	NTPC is pursuing a case before Bombay High Court against Reliance Industries over a December 2005 contract that has since gone sour. RIL had offered to supply 12mmscmd of gas to the two power projects at a price of $2.34 per million British thermal units (mBtu) for a period of 17 years.        
	Later, RIL said it couldnt supply the gas at the price, thereby stalling plans to expand the generating capacity of the two Gujarat projects by 1300MW each.        
	The KG-D6 gasfield started commercial production in April and the government started farming out gas entitlements to existing power, fertiliser, steel and petrochemical plants. The trouble was that this allocation was made at a government-mandated price of $4.20 per mBtu.        
	Initially, NTPC got an allocation of 2.67 mmscmd from the KG-D6 field. Of this, 1.76 mmscmd was supposed to go to Kawas and 0.30 mmscmd to Gandhar. The rest was supposed to go to the three northern plants.        
	But NTPC was reluctant to buy gas from RIL for the Kawas and Gandhar plants at $4.20 per mBtu as that could prejudice its position in the court battle with RIL.        
	On September 23, NTPC signed gas sales and purchase agreements for less than one-fourth of the earmarked volumes. Under these contracts, the Faridabad plant would get 0.13 mmscmd, Anta 0.03 mmscmd and Dadri 0.45 mmscmd of gas.         
	The e-GoM has now stepped in to enable NTPC to lift its entire entitlement from the KG-D6 gasfield.        
	First, NTPCs gas entitlement from KG-D6 has been raised slightly to 2.71 mmscmd  and all of this will go to the three northern plants.        
	Second, the Kawas and Gandhar projects will tap into the gas from fields operated by state-owned oil prospecting companies such as ONGC as well as Panna, Mukta and Tapti (PMT) fields that were earmarked for the Anta, Faridabad and Dadri plants. PMT is a joint venture of Reliance Industries, ONGC and British Gas.         
	The arrangement is a win-win for everyone. Kawas and Gandhar  which operate at a plant load factor of 70 per cent of their rated capacities of 645MW and 648MW, respectively will be able to source gas at $2 per mBtu under the administered price mechanism (APM).         
	The APM regime covers fields owned by ONGC and Oil India Ltd.        
	Kawas and Gandhar may have to pay a little more for the PMT gas but it will still be a lot less than what they pay now. At present, NTPC buys spot re-gasified LNG at competitive rates from the market through tenders and without any take or pay liability for these two plants.

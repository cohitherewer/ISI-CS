	Mumbai, May 10: FMCG major Hindustan Unilever Ltd today reported a 3.7 per cent rise in net profit at Rs 395 crore for the quarter ended March 31, 2009 compared with Rs 381 crore in the same period last year.

	Chairman Harish Manwani attributed the companys average performance to the recession. There are signs of downtrading and consolidation at retail outlets and trade de-stocking as there were frequent price revisions to improve competitiveness, Manwani said.        
	Total income went up to Rs 4,035.37 crore during the reporting quarter against Rs 3,839.88 crore in the corresponding quarter of the previous fiscal, the company said in a statement.        
	The company recommended a 400 per cent final dividend, or Rs 4 per share of Re 1 each, for the 15 months ended March 31, 2009, from January 1, 2008.        
	According to CEO Nitin Paranjpe, though there has been an underlying value growth of 12 per cent in the March quarter, underlying volumes have decelerated by 4.2 per cent.        
	During the quarter, skin cleaning products suffered a decline in market share, while the oral category also did not fare well. Pepsodent needs fixing, said Manwani.        
	The laundry business grew well, driven by Surf and Rin. Wheels growth was lower due to grammage impact. Growth in personal wash segment was led by Lux and Dove. Shampoo category witnessed moderate growth with Dove gaining market share and Sunsilk holding, the statement said.        
	According to Manwani, the focus now will be on cutting costs and managing shorter execution cycles. Its business as usual on growth and business unusual on costs.        
	Exports fell to Rs 218.56 crore during the quarter ended March 31, 2009 from Rs 397.32 crore in the same quarter of the previous fiscal.        
	Hindustan Unilever used raw material worth Rs 1,604.56 crore during the quarter ended March 2009, against Rs 1,691.85 crore in the year-ago period. The drop in raw material prices, except tea, helped the company to beef up its margin.        
	The company changed its accounting year from January-December to April-March. The full-year audited results for the 15-month period ending March 31, 2009, are not comparable with those of the year ended December 31, 2007. Hence, the company has come out with unaudited results for the 12-month period ended March 31, 2009.         
	During the period, net sales grew 15.5 per cent to Rs 16,477 crore and net profit rose 10.6 per cent to Rs 2,115.5 crore. The company has made a one-time provision of Rs 60.48 crore for retirements benefits and Rs 25.70 crore for restructuring costs.

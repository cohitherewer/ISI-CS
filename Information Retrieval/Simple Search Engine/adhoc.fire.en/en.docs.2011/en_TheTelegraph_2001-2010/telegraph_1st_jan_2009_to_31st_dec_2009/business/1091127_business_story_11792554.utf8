          R. SURYAMURTHY                                            
	New Delhi, Nov. 26: A battle is brewing between the finance and commerce ministries over the provisions on SEZs in the direct taxes code.        
	The codes proposals to scythe through the exemptions enjoyed by the SEZs have raised the hackles of the commerce ministry.        
	We feel that the removal of exemptions will shake investor confidence in India and affect the flow of investments into SEZs. We are consulting with the revenue department on the issue, a senior commerce ministry official said.         
	The SEZ Act of 2005, which became operational from February 10, 2006, gave the units within the zones and developers certain tax benefits.        
	Under the act, developers, during the first 15 years, are entitled to 100 per cent tax exemption on profits for 10 years on the trot. Units get full exemption on export profits in the first five years of operations and 50 per cent exemption for the next five years.        
	From the 11th to the 15th year, the units are entitled to 50 per cent exemption on reinvested profits.        
	The proposed direct taxes code allows developers to recover capital and revenue expenditure  except expenditure on land. Beyond this, they will have to pay income tax on profits.        
	The code has contradicted the provisions of the SEZ act, and the ambiguities are making things worse for the investors, according to L.B. Syngal, director-general of the Export Promotion Council for EOUs and SEZ units.        
	He said investors were refraining from taking decisions.        
	SEZ projects are typically long-gestation projects and the lack of certainty about the tax laws can make the developers apprehensive about the returns.        
	Nearly 40 per cent of the $21-billion exports of gems and jewellery in the last fiscal were from SEZs or EoUs. The key reason for the growth of this sector has been the tax incentives provided to the SEZs and EoU units, according to Vasant Mehta, chairman of the Gem amp; Jewellery Export Promotion Council.        
	He said the government should continue with the benefits to improve the viability of the gems and jewellery business, which made up 15 per cent of the countrys total merchandise export of $168 billion in 2008-09. The government expects exports to touch $165-175 billion during 2009-10.        
	Gems and jewellery exports, which declined by 36 per cent in October-December 2008, has been gradually returning to the growth path and during April-September, shipments recorded a growth of about 31 per cent.        
	Investments of more than Rs 100,000 crore have been made in 98 SEZs.         
	Exports from SEZs in 2008-09 are Rs 99,689 crore, while in the first half of 2009-10, exports have already reached Rs 89,000 crore.        
	Assuming the proposals in the tax code become reality, the developers are facing an improbable deadline.

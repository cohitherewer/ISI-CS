The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Abu Dhabi lifeline for Dubai

          LANDON THOMAS AMP; BETTINA WASSENER                           Investors discuss stock trends at the Dubai Financial Market on Monday. (AFP)                                  
	London, Dec. 14: Abu Dhabi  the oil-rich governing emirate of the United Arab Emirates  surprised investors on Monday by pledging to provide $10 billion to Dubai, easing fears about an outright debt default by the smaller, struggling emirate.        
	The injection allows the repayment of a $4.1-billion bond maturing on Monday issued by Nakheel, a property developer owned by Dubai World, the emirates flagship investment company, and creator of the iconic palm-shaped islands that have come to epitomise Dubais construction boom.        
	Stock markets across Asia rebounded after the announcement, with the Hang Seng in Hong Kong rising 0.8 per cent and the Nikkei 225 index in Japan reversing earlier losses to close nearly flat. The Japanese yen  which often rises on the back of market nervousness  eased against the US dollar and the euro.        
	In Dubai and Abu Dhabi, stocks of beaten down banks and real estate companies rallied sharply.        
	The bailout came as a shock to many investors as fears had grown that Abu Dhabi would stand by and let Nakheel fail to send a message to free-spending Dubai and its bankers that Abu Dhabi would not make good on all of its fellow emirates excesses.        
	But a growing sense within the region that other indebted companies, in particular Dubai Holdings, the conglomerate owned by Dubais ruler, Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, would also have trouble meeting their obligations seems to have pressed Abu Dhabi to take immediate action.        
	Abu Dhabi may also have been influenced by the aggressive pose taken by Nakheels creditors, many of whom were foreign hedge funds, who, instead of negotiating, aimed to force Dubai World into default as a means of securing some of its valuable assets, like its highly strategic port operations.        
	While there have always been tensions between the expansionist ambitions of Dubai and more conservative Abu Dhabi, the prospect of foreign investors laying claim to some of the UAEs most valuable properties seems to have brought the two emirates together  for the time being at least.        
	Abu Dhabi was also taken aback by the harsh reaction of global investors after Dubai said in late November that it would ask Dubai Worlds creditors for a six-month delay on some of its debt payments.        
	Credit rating agencies have downgraded most institutions in Dubai and Abu Dhabi, making it extremely difficult for these companies to raise funds abroad.        
	In a statement on Monday, the Dubai government said, The government of Abu Dhabi has agreed to fund $10 billion to the Dubai Financial Support Fund that will be used to satisfy a series of upcoming obligations on Dubai World.         
	As a first action for the new fund, the Dubai government has authorised $4.1 billion to be used to pay the sukuk obligations that are due today, the government statement said.        
	The statement added that the remaining funds would also provide for interest expenses and company working capital through April 30, 2010  conditioned on the company being successful in negotiating a standstill as previously announced.        
	Dubai, one of the seven members in the UAE, had racked over $100 billion in debt in little more than a decade to finance a spectacular construction boom and drive to become a regional financial hub. Many of its construction sites and lavish developments now stand empty or half-completed  victims of the global economic downturn.        
	While the bailout comes as a reprieve for Dubai World, it does not come close to wiping the slate clean for Dubai Inc as a whole.         
	Many government-linked corporations are still hamstrung by steep debt burdens, and analysts expect that these will be handled on a case-by-case basis in the future, with some being allowed to fail but the largest receiving support.        
	Analysts also pointed to a part of the statement that promised a comprehensive reorganisation law to help creditors, a step likely to result in measures that would allow ailing companies to restructure their debts in a more orderly process.        
	Nevertheless, the action by Abu Dhabi sends a forceful message to global investors and lenders that Dubais debts will, in the end, be backed by its richer neighbour.

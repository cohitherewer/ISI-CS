                                                                                                               Jolt to Reliance KG gas hunt
          OUR BUREAU                                            
	Mumbai, Oct. 23: Reliance Industries has suffered a setback in its deepwater exploration for gas in the D9 block of the Krishna-Godavari basin after being forced to abandon the first well that was spudded almost two months ago.        
	The setback was reported today by Hardy Oil, the junior partner in the deepwater oil and gasfield that was awarded to the Reliance-led consortium in 2002.        
	Reliance Industries has a 90 per cent stake in the gasfield, while Hardy Oil has a 10 per cent participatory interest through a wholly owned subsidiary, Hardy Exploration and Production (India) Inc, which is based in Chennai.        
	D9 is a block that is bang next to the more famous D6 block  one of the five largest deepwater gas projects in the world  that has already yielded three major gas finds.        
	The exploratory well KGD-A1 drilled to a total depth of 4,875 metres to explore the Middle and Lower Miocene targets will be plugged and abandoned, Hardy Oil said, indicating a poor gas find.         
	Miocene refers to a geological epoch that stretches from 23 million to 5.3 million years before the present day. The Earth went from the red-hot Oligocene epoch through the Miocene and into the Pliocene period as it cooled through several Ice Ages.        
	While encountering some background gas at the time of drilling, the well encountered poor reservoir sands in both the Middle and Lower Miocene target levels, Hardy Oil said.        
	Reacting to the development, Reliance said, The company remains committed to pursuing the exploration campaign within this block and will incorporate data and information from this well to upgrade the prospect inventory for drilling of three more wells. The Reliance stock tumbled over 4 per cent to close at Rs 2,047.30, down Rs 86.25 from Thursdays close of Rs 2,133.55 on the Bombay Stock Exchange.        
	The first phase of the exploration licence for the D9 block  which sprawls across 11,605 square kilometres in the Bay of Bengal  mandates the drilling of four wells.         
	On its website, Hardy Oil explained why the D9 gas field was significant.        
	The licence is considered as having high potential as it is situated adjacent to the prolific Dhirubhai field discovered and operated by Reliance, it noted.        
	Hardy Oil had earlier estimated recoverable reserves from the D9 gas field at 6.8 trillion cubic feet of gas.         
	I would expect that to change, Hardy Oils chief executive officer Sastry Karra told Reuters.        
	The joint venture has focussed its interest in the relatively shallow northwestern corner of the concession, adjacent to the D6 field.         
	The data obtained from this first exploration parametric well is very significant and will be integrated with the existing geological model to improve the prospect of the block before drilling subsequent wells, Hardy Oil said.        
	Gas exploration in D9 was delayed by over two years as Reliance Industries had chosen to focus on the D6 field. The delay was accentuated by the severe shortage of deepwater exploration rigs.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Telecom excites foreign investors
                                                                                                               Telecom excites foreign investors
          JAYATI GHOSE                              
	New Delhi, Jan. 25: Foreign investment in telecom, which crossed $5 billion last year, is likely to increase at least 20 per cent this year because of the growth prospects provided by virtual network operators and 3G services.         
	The government is likely to allow mobile virtual network operators (MVNOs)  who buy bulk airtime from existing players for resell under their own brand  to operate from February.         
	Moreover the 3G auction, which will also take place in the next few months, is likely to generate interest among foreign players such as Americas AT amp;T and Germanys Deutsche Telekom.         
	High-speed 3G services will allow firms to provide value-added offerings such as video on demand and mobile TV having strong revenue potential.         
	At present, telecom service providers add more than 9 million subscribers per month with the potential of taking the total subscriber base to 700 million in the next five years, said Bundeep Singh Rangar, chairman of IndusView, a Delhi-based research and advisory firm.         
	In terms of expected revenues, that translates to more than $37 billion by 2012, growing at an annual growth rate of 18 per cent. Such growth potential offers enough incentive to overseas service providers to vie for their share of the pie, he said.         
	Sudipto Bose, an independent telecom analyst, said the opening up of the MVNO sector and the possibility of a limited auction for 3G services would result in a 20 per cent rise in FDI inflows on a conservative estimate.        
	Last year, Japans NTT DoCoMo, Norways Telenor, UAEs Etisalat, and Russias Sistema Telecom had invested around $5 billion in the domestic telecom business.        
	The Indian telecom sector, which has an annual subscriber growth of 21 per cent, requires investments worth $73 billion over the next five years to acquire a teledensity of up to 45 per cent, analysts said. Teledensity is the number of subscribers per 100 of the population.

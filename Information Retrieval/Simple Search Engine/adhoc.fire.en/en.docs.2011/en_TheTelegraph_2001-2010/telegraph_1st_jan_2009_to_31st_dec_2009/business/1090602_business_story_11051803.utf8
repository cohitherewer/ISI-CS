	New Delhi, June 1: Bharat Sanchar Nigam Limited (BSNL) is keen on raising cash through its proposed equity listing to fund overseas and domestic expansion plans, including 3G.        
	However, the government is yet to initiate formal communications with the state-owned telecom firm.        
	Its board had last year approved a plan for government divestment of a 10 per cent stake, but opposition by the unions had stalled the exercise.         
	Analysts expect the new government to revive the plans and list the company later this year, or in early 2010. Newly appointed telecom minister A. Raja has asked the BSNL management to initiate discussions with employees unions.        
	While we have cash reserves for the current fiscal, we would need to raise capital through the listing of the company to fund 3G, WiMax auction and overseas expansion, said Kuldeep Goyal, chairman and managing director of BSNL. The company is exploring opportunities in many geographical regions overseas, but is more interested in Africa and West Asia.        
	Raja begins innings        
	Starting his second innings as the IT and communications minister, A. Raja today said tax sops to software services firms should be extended by another two years.         
	I will speak to the Prime Minister and the finance minister to extend the STPI (Software Technology Park of India) scheme benefits, said Raja.                           
	Raja is confident of completing the 3G auction and spectrum allocation by the end of 2009.

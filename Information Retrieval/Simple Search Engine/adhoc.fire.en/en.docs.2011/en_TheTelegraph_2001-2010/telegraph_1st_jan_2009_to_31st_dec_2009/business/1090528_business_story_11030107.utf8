The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Bengal bets on infotech investment
                                                                                                               Bengal bets on infotech investment
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Calcutta, May 27: Bengal is hopeful of attracting more infotech firms at a time when IT majors are going slow on infrastructure spending and developers are tweaking projects.        
	We are confident of growing faster than last year. We are in talks with a few global IT firms who have shown interest in establishing operations here, Bengal IT minister Debesh Das said on the sidelines of a programme organised by the Indian Chamber of Commerce today.         
	In 2008-09, 30 new IT and ITeS firms had come to Bengal against 33 a year ago.        
	During the last few months, the countrys top three software exporters  TCS, Infosys and Wipro  have been talking of reducing their infrastructure spending as part of the cost-cutting measures to tackle the global financial downturn.         
	Last week, infrastructure developer DLF had sought a denotification of the IT/ITeS special economic zones it had proposed to establish on 25.89 acres at Rajarhat. None of the companies intending to set up operations here, has expressed any intention to back out, Das said. The state is in the process of acquiring land for the tech firms, he said.        
	On the DLF project, he said, I am not aware of what you are saying. You may be right. We are not worried.        
	Sources said DLF might not scrap the project. Denotification would allow the company to convert the building into normal commercial space, allowing it to let out space to any tenant, irrespective of whether the prospective customer is engaged in exports or not.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Govt weighs minority stake sale in PSUs
                                                                                                               Govt weighs minority stake sale in PSUs
          JAYANTA ROY CHOWDHURY                                            
	New Delhi, May 27: The new government plans to sell minority stakes in at least nine state-run companies to enhance the corpus of the National Investment Fund, whose proceeds can be used for social development.        
	Officials said the size of the fund could be trebled from the current level of Rs 994 crore through divestment of between 5 per cent and 10 per cent in select companies such as NHPC Limited, Oil India, RITES and Air India.         
	Since the government wishes to push social sector spending, especially in health and education with a large number of AIIMs-like hospitals and IITs in the pipeline, it needs larger doses of funds. Hence the new emphasis on divestment, the officials said.         
	Earlier, the UPAs attempts to sell stakes were thwarted by its former ally, the Left, and also the DMK.         
	Finance minister Pranab Mukherjee, according to the officials, prefers the fiscal deficit to be at 5.5 per cent of GDP, meaning the higher spend on social development needs to be funded from other receipts.         
	According to the officials, the stock market is once again moving upwards. So they expect issues that will come from September onwards to do well.         
	Sick PSUs could be put up for sale in a bid to revive them.         
	In the last five years, the Nitish Sengupta-headed Board for Reconstruction of Public Sector Enterprises had submitted recommendations in 54 cases, suggesting revival through packages, joint ventures and divestments.         
	The government has approved revival packages in 34 cases and has closed down two companies.         
	Other public sector units that could be targeted include Hindustan Fertiliser Corporation Ltd, the Fertiliser Corporation of India, Konkan Railway Corporation Ltd and ITI Ltd.        
	Top officials said the mega-issue would be that of telecom giant BSNL.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Patel: Setting terms                                  
	New Delhi, Nov. 12: The government is likely to inject some equity into ailing Air India by March end, provided the airline generates another Rs 2,000 crore in cash.        
	We are broadly looking at equity infusion linked to monthly performance parameters and we are only looking at till March (2010). This is not the total equity infusion being looked at for Air India, civil aviation minister Praful Patel said after an almost two-hour meeting of a group of ministers (GoM) on the issue.        
	Air India will have to generate at least Rs 2,000 crore in cash through cost-cutting measures and enhanced revenue to get the equity prop, which could be Rs 1,500-2,000 crore, officials said.         
	However, the demand for a soft loan of up to Rs 3,000 crore has been rejected. Air India had sought Rs 5,000 crore from the government.        
	At todays meting, AI officials submitted a plan to the GoM  headed by finance minister Pranab Mukherjee  to prune costs. Others present at the meeting were petroleum minister Murli Deora, home minister P. Chidambaram and Montek Singh Ahluwalia, deputy chairman of the Planning Commission.        
	Earlier this month, Air India decided to lease out 10 aircraft to cut costs. Officials said steps such as renegotiation of payouts, route restructuring, and fleet optimisation had been taken to increase savings.        
	Air India suffered a net loss of Rs 5,548.26 crore in 2008-09. Its revenues fell to Rs 13,479 crore in 2008-09 from Rs 15,252 crore in 2007-08. The cash-strapped carrier attributed the loss to global recession and a drop in load factors and passenger count.        
	A high level committee headed by the cabinet secretary had demanded that the airline submit a workable plan before the government gave loan guarantees and infused fresh capital into the carrier.        
	Air India, which has accumulated losses of Rs 7,200 crore, is seeking government guarantee to retire high-cost debts and replace them with cheaper credit.        
	Of its Rs 16,000-crore debt account, around Rs 11,000 crore is high-cost debt.

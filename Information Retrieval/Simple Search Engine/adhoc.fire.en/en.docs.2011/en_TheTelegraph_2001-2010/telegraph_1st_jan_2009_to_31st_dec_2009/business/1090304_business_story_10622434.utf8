The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Bumpy ride for Air India bailout plan

	New Delhi, March 3: Cabinet secretary K. M. Chandrasekhar is not fully convinced of the merits of state-run Air Indias bailout proposal, which comprises an equity infusion of Rs 1,231 crore and a soft loan of Rs 2,750 crore.        
	Prior to reintroducing the proposal before the committee of secretaries, the civil aviation ministry will now have to hold further discussions with other ministries, including finance.         
	In the meantime, the ailing carrier will have to continue servicing unviable routes, while running up huge loans on aircraft to operate an unwieldy number of flights.        
	Air India plans to spend around Rs 8,165.44 crore in the next fiscal on aircraft.        
	Many within the government feel that irrespective of the bailout, the airline should take a hard look at servicing unviable routes.         
	Air India had sought equity to strengthen its balance sheet and get loans at cheaper rates for expansion.         
	It plans to buy around 111 aircraft worth about Rs 44,000 crore as it reported a loss of over Rs 2,000 crore in 2007-08. The airline is expected to suffer a larger loss in this fiscal.         
	The plea for aid comes on the back of similar reliefs given to other airlines and airports.         
	Last year, the government had allowed airlines, including Kingfisher and Jet Airways, to pay their jet fuel outstandings running to over Rs 2,900 crore in six interest-free instalments. This helped solve their cash flow problems. All over the world, states give such soft loans and other assistance to national carriers in stressed times, officials said.         
	The Delhi and Mumbai airports were permitted to charge user fees after they complained that they were unable to sustain modernisation costs.

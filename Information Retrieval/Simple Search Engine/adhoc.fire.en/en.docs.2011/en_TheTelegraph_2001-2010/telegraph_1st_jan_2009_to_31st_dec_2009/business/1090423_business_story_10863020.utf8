The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Ruia pledges 51% of Dunlop to raise Rs 600 crore

          SAMBIT SAHA                          Ruia: Cash chase                                  
	Calcutta, April 22: Dunlop promoter Pawan K. Ruia has pledged 51 per cent of the company with a financial institution to raise Rs 600 crore ($125 million).        
	The shares were pledged by two of the promoter group companies  DIL Rim amp; Wheel Corporation (DRW) and Highland Traders.        
	Ruia holds 74.5 per cent in Dunlop India, of which DRW and Highland own 28.94 per cent and 27.94 per cent, respectively.        
	Though Dunlop disclosed the matter to shareholders today, the deal happened in October last year when the global financial crisis hit the international credit market following the collapse of Lehman Brothers in the US.        
	We raised the money from an Indian banks foreign branch. It was a difficult proposition at that time, Ruia, chairman of Dunlop India, told The Telegraph.        
	The funds raised by the two companies were used to re-finance a short-term but costlier bridge loan that the promoters had taken in late 2007 from a clutch of overseas hedge funds.        
	By refinancing the loan, Dunlop lowered the cost of borrowing from 14 per cent to 9 per cent. The new loan has a tenure of four years.        
	The rejig in the loan portfolio also helped the Ruias in a different way. The company would have had to part with 14 per cent equity if it failed to pay up within a specified date. When Ruia repaid the hedge fund borrowing with the bank loan, he had to part with only 5 per cent equity.        
	Spinikar, a UK-based hedge fund, will pick up the 5 per cent stake. By arranging the funds in October, we managed to avert higher equity dilution, Ruia said.        
	However, most of the money raised from the hedge funds or the recent bank loan would not enter the companys books.        
	Much of the $100 million borrowed from hedge funds was used to finance the acquisition of Dunlop and Falcon from its erstwhile owner, the Chhabria family, in end 2005.        
	Ruia said the Sahagunj plant was being refurbished and production of off-the-road tyres, truck tyres and industrial products such as belts would start in May.

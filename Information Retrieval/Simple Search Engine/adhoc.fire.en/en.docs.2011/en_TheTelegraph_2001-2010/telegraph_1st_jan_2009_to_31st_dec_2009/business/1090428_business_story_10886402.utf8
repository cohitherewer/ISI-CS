	New Delhi, April 27: The Foreign Investment Promotion Board today approved the proposal of Tikona Digital Networks to sell a majority stake to a clutch of foreign funds led by Goldman Sachs.         
	Tikona Digital will get foreign direct investment worth Rs 237.26 crore from four institutional investors  Goldman Sachs Investment Partners, Indivision India Partners, Oak India Investments and Green Lotus.         
	The foreign investors will have a combined stake of 69.9 per cent in Tikona. Founded by former Reliance Telecom executives Rajesh Tiwari and Prakash Bajpai, Tikona provides broadband and Internet application services.         
	Bajpai refused to comment on the future investment and expansion plans of the company when contacted by The Telegraph.         
	Bajpai was earlier the president and CEO of Reliance Communications, while Tiwari was group director at Reliance-ADAG.         
	The company will issue 38.86 lakh compulsorily convertible debentures and 34,560 equity shares to investors and promoters. On conversion, the institutional investors will hold a 69.9 per cent stake in the Internet service provider, while the promoters will hold 2.04 per cent each.         
	Nokias plan to set up the first single-retail joint venture in India for mobile handsets was among the 22 FDI proposals approved by the FIPB. Nokia will hold a 51 per cent stake and HCL Infocomm 49 per cent in the joint venture.        
	Japanese two-wheeler maker Yamahas proposal to transfer its Indian sales business to a new entity  India Yamaha Motor Pvt Ltd  was also cleared by the FIPB. The proposal had been deferred earlier by the FIPB following objections raised by the industry ministry. The ministry said that allowing import would lead to retail trading.        
	Electrosteel Castings Ltd will get Rs 157.47 crore of FDI, while construction and infrastructure company Anant Raj got the nod for a proposal involving Rs 90.24 crore.

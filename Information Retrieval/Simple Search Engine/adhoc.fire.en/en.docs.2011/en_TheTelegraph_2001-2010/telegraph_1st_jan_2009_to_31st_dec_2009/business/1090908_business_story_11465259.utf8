	Calcutta, Sept. 7: McNally Bharat Engineering Ltd, a Brij Mohan Khaitan group outfit, has decided to come out with a Rs 43.54-crore rights issue to increase the companys net worth and enable it to bid for big projects.        
	The company has set its sights on EPC (engineering, procurement, construction) contracts of power firms. It is bidding for deals worth more than Rs 6,000 crore.        
	This is a new area we are getting into. This business will contribute around 50 per cent to the companys turnover in the next 2-3 years, chairman Deepak Khaitan said today.        
	The rights issue will help the company bid for projects involving construction of power plants  especially material handling, water pipeline and civil construction.        
	McNally will issue one share for every 10 held at Rs 140 apiece. The offer will be at a 25 per cent discount to the current market price of Rs 188. Managing director Srinivas Singh said the McNally group, along with its German subsidiary and McNally Sayaji, would clock a turnover of Rs 2,000 crore during the fiscal.

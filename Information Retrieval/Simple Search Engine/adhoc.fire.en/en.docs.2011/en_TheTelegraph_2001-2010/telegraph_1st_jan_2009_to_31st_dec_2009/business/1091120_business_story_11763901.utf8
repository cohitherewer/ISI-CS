	New Delhi, Nov. 19: Annual food inflation was 14.55 per cent for the week ended November 7, fuelled by the higher prices of staple items such as potatoes, onions and pulses.        
	Farmers had to contend with the drought-like conditions in August and heavy rains later which hit food crops and pushed up prices. Potatoes are dearer by 102.47 per cent, onions, 38.24 per cent, and pulses, 27.03 per cent.         
	On a weekly basis, inflation rose 0.87 percentage points from 13.68 per cent.         
	Food inflation is likely to remain high, unless prospects of rabi are known. It is a matter of concern. High onion and potato prices could be seasonal, D.K. Joshi, economist at Crisil, said.        
	On a yearly basis, cereal prices rose 13.16 per cent. Rice became dearer by 11.65 per cent, wheat, 12.60 per cent, and milk, 11.29 per cent.         
	Non-food articles inflation rose to 0.59 per cent from (-)0.17 per cent a week ago.        
	A group of ministers, headed by finance minister Pranab Mukherjee, is slated to meet tomorrow to decide on the quantity of rice to be imported from Thailand and Vietnam. We started the rice season from October, with almost six million tonnes of surplus. Still, there is a projection of some shortfall in kharif crops. To make up, we will have to make some imports, Mukherjee has said.

	Rice purchases exceeding 10,000 tonnes will come under official scrutiny in the kharif marketing season, a move that will help check hoarding and price rise. A company or individual will have to inform their respective state government about any such transaction, a food ministry notification said.

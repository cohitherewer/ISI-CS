The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Asarco agony for Sterlite
                                                                                                               Asarco agony for Sterlite
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                               
	Mumbai, Sept. 1: In a setback to Sterlite Industries, a US bankruptcy court has recommended rival Grupo Mexicos bid to acquire copper miner Asarco LLC over that made by the Anil Agarwal group company.         
	The court recommended to a federal district court in the US that it approve Grupo Mexicos plan rather than Sterlites as the former was more likely to pay the creditors in full. The district court will now take a final decision on the matter, and this is expected over the next few weeks.         
	The verdict affected the Sterlite scrip today as the Asarco acquisition was seen as a positive development for the company. On the BSE, the Sterlite share closed nearly 3 per cent lower at Rs 655.85. Though officials of Sterlite were not available for comments, market circles do not rule out the possibility of the Anil Agarwal company sweetening its offer.         
	In a statement, Grupo Mexico said that US Bankruptcy Court Judge Richard Schmidt had recommended the confirmation of its full payment reorganisation plan for Asarco.         
	By this ruling, the control of Asarco will be returned to Grupo Mexicos subsidiary Americas Mining Corp. In reaching his decision, Judge Schmidt determined that Grupo Mexicos plan, valued at $3.6 billion, was superior to a competing plan submitted by Sterlite Industries, Grupo Mexico said.         
	In May last year, Sterlite Industries had announced its intention to acquire all the operating assets of Asarco, the Tucson-based mining, smelting and refining company for $2.6 billion in cash. Asarco had filed for bankruptcy and it also faced environment-related liabilities. However, the global slowdown saw Sterlite seeking lower valuation for the company in October.

                                                                                                                 Q amp;A      Loan puzzle
                                My son took a loan of Rs 2,45,840 to pursue a B.Tech course from the Bank of Indias Salt Lake branch under the State Education Loan Scheme on September 5, 2008. The bank asked us to pay a cheque of Rs 5,676 as one-time premium for a 12-year credit assurance policy from ICICI Prudential Life Insurance Company. The bank has a tie-up with ICICI Prudential. On January1, 2009, we received from ICICI Prudential Life a credit assurance policy of six years covering loan of Rs 2,28,000 and a life insurance policy of 40 years with annual premium payment. We brought this to the notice of the bank in February. But till date we have not received any reply. What shall we do?          C.N. Mukherjee, Salt Lake
                    Hope you have kept a receipt acknowledgement of the complaint letter you had written to the bank in February. However, send a reminder now and keep a receipt copy of the same. Wait for a month for a reply from the bank. If you dont get it, approach the banking ombudsman at the regional office of the Reserve Bank of India.                                  Gift tax      I want to gift Rs 48,000 through a cheque to my wife on her birthday. Will she have to pay any tax on this?        R.K. Singhal, Barrackpore
                    Gift tax has been abolished. So, neither you nor your wife will have to pay any tax on this. However, she is a housewife with no independent source of income. So, any income from investment of the gifted amount will be clubbed with your income and you shall have to pay income tax thereon.                      Column concern      Interest payable on housing loan is deductible from computation of total income under the Income Tax Act. In which column of ITR 2 should I show this deduction?        Nipish Kanti Halder, Bally
                    Schedule HP of ITR 2 deals with income from property. You should show this in the specified space under first property head.

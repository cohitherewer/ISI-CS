The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Crisis over, Jet to trim frills   Airline focus on low-cost model
                                                                                                               Crisis over, Jet to trim frills     Airline focus on low-cost model
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                                
	Mumbai, Sept. 13: In one months time, Jet Airways is scheduled to morph into a largely no-frills airline  with over two thirds of its seating capacity on its 86 planes transferred to a new service called Jet Konnect.        
	The Rs 11,450-crore airline is hoping that the makeover will change its fortunes after racking up a post-tax loss of Rs 225 crore on its domestic and overseas operations in the first quarter ended June 30.        
	The Jet Konnect service was introduced in May with nine of the airlines 48 Boeing 737s  the workhorse in the Jet fleet  and 10 ATR planes and accounted for one-third of the airlines seating capacity. By October, the airline plans to have 16 B-737s and 10 ATRs operating under the Jet Konnect service  which effectively means two-thirds of the airline will be a no-frills service.        
	As part of the changeover, Jet has been ripping out the business class seats from its planes and moving to a single class configuration, thereby raising the seating capacity on these planes by 20 to 25 per cent. Jet has 33,000 seats on offer every day on its domestic flights which will go up to 38,000 seats once all the 16 B-737s convert to a single configuration for the Jet Konnect service.        
	It isnt only the full service airline that has started concentrating on low-yield passengers. Air India is also looking to enter aggressively into this space  which means loads of competition for budget carriers such as IndiGo, SpiceJet and GoAir.        
	Tough times        
	The full service airlines push into the low-cost carrier space has been promoted by the 24 per cent slump in business travel across the aviation industry.        
	The switchover has been also prompted by the price sensitiveness of air travel during a tumultuous year for airlines when the domestic aviation market has shrunk by 10 per cent. Jet claims the switch to the no-frills service has boosted revenues by about 6 per cent on the planes that have been converted to cater to the no-frills service.        
	Soon, Jet plans to offer a similar low-cost service on short-haul international flights as well to compete with international low-cost carriers. However, Jets experience with the low-cost model has not been very encouraging. According to Mumbai-based brokerage house Enams senior research analyst Hemant Patel, In 2008-09, JetLite notched up revenues of Rs 2.8 per km whereas costs, including lease rentals, hovered around Rs 3.8 per km.        
	Jet will also have to face several challenges as it seeks to operate a hybrid model with both low-cost operations under two brands as well as a full service airline.        
	The airline  which started commercial operations in May 1993  will have to contend with a massive change in culture within the organisation, prevent cannibalisation into the full fare category and keep a lid on costs for two-thirds of the airline.         
	Culture will be a big issue: Jet pilots who are used to five-star hotel accommodation during layovers or foreign jaunts with families will not be entitled to such privileges if they start flying the low-cost brands  Jet Konnect or Jet Lite, said an industry source.         
	Twin approaches        
	Jet believes it can straddle both spaces  a full service airline that will connect the metros and a low-cost service that will link other parts of the country.        
	We will always be flexible to the market demands to deploy the right capacity and the right business model. But I dont see a quick reversal in the current trend. Consumer behaviour right now is towards lower fares, and we have to adjust our strategies accordingly, Jet Airways CEO Wolfgang Prock-Schauer told analysts in a conference call after the airline came out with its first-quarter results on July 27.        
	The airline, which saw its total income tumble over 17 per cent to Rs 2,371.21 crore in the first quarter, believes that it will be able to earn more revenues if it can pack its planes with low-fare passengers.        
	Jet hasnt ruled out the possibility of a merger of Jet Konnect and JetLite, the low-cost carrier which the airline eventually bought from the Sahara group in April 2007 for Rs 1,450 crore. But a merger presents problems as well  since it will first have to deal with the accumulated losses at JetLite.        
	Some rough edges        
	The airlines DNA is high cost arising from inter-line agreements, frequent flier programmes, meal systems or even reservation systems. For instance, it will be difficult to put an overseas passenger who has been flying on a partner airline on a low-cost carrier once he reaches India, said a top executive from a competing airline.         
	Kapil Kaul, CEO (India and West Asia) of the Centre for Asia Pacific Aviation, said, Jet Konnect is currently housed under the Jet Airways cost structure and that makes the success of Jet Konnect from a profit and loss point of view very challenging.        
	The bigger issue is the morale within the Jet workforce  be it pilots, cabin crew or ground staff. In October 2008, it suddenly laid off 1,900 employees which was the largest layoff in the history of Indian aviation. The management was persuaded to take them back. The pilots strike has only exacerbated its problems.         
	Even within the Jet staff there is a feeling that even though Jet and Kingfisher are both facing mounting losses, the latter will manage to pull it off, said a Jet insider.

                                                                                                               Reddy for cohesive approach to probe 
          JAYANTA ROY CHOWDHURY                          Reddy: Co-ordination call                                  
	New Delhi, Jan. 28: Andhra Pradesh chief minister Y.S. Rajasekhara Reddy has written to Prime Minister Manmohan Singh for better co-ordination among the agencies probing Satyam.         
	The state government has found proof of insider trading and detected the fudging of bank accounts vis--vis Satyam, Reddy wrote. Rivals have accused the chief minister for awarding contracts to Maytas Infra, promoted by the Raju family.        
	Investigations have so far revealed the embellishment of bank accounts for more than seven years to impress the clients within the country and overseas. This inflation of current account balance is testified by the bank officials concerned, according to the letter.        
	The Andhra Pradesh CID, the letter said, has found that more than 300 companies were set up by close relatives of Ramalinga Raju and this facilitated insider trading of shares.         
	Sources said Raju and the other promoters could have earned about Rs 2,500 crore through the sale of shares in Satyam in the last eight years.         
	During this period, the familys holdings came down from 25.6 per cent in March 2001 to 8.74 per cent in January.         
	Officials said Reddy wrote the letter after reports about the CID not doing a good job and denying Sebi and the central governments Serious Frauds Investigation Office access to Raju.         
	AP government officials said the reason why Sebi could not get custody of Raju was that it could not even tell the judge on what grounds and under which section of the law they were seeking custody.

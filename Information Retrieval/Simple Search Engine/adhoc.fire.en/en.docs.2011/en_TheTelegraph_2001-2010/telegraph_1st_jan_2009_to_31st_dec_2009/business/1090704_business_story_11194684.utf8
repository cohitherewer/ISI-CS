The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Coal shock for power
                                                                                                               Coal shock for power
                            
	New Delhi, July 3 (PTI): The government today cancelled coal linkages of 25 captive power plants with a combined capacity of 1,292 MW and requiring 5.844 million tonnes of coal per annum.         
	According to coal minister Sriprakash Jaiswal, the 25 units failed to set up power plants in spite of being accorded linkage by the coal ministry between 1996 and 2006.         
	He said, In seven cases, appropriate directions have already been issued for signing the fuel supply agreement.         
	In the remaining 19 cases, Coal India Limited has been asked to place their names on the websites and also send letters asking them to give the detailed project status within 15 days, failing which linkage will be cancelled without any further notice, he said.        
	Last month, the ministry held a meeting with private and public sector companies, including NTPC, SAIL, and NMDC, and reviewed the progress of work on the captive coal blocks allotted to them.         
	The ministry has already served de-allocation notices on 14 coal properties.         
	Most of the plants that lost coal linkages are located in Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand, and Maharashtra. Among the firms that were issued show-cause notices earlier include Tata Sponge, NCT Delhi and Monnet Ispat.

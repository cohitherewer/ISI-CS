	Calcutta, June 12: Srei Infrastructure Finance Ltd will raise Rs 1,000 crore from the domestic market by issuing non-convertible debentures (NCDs) during the current financial year.         
	There is ample demand from investors for NCDs as can be witnessed from Tata Capitals success, said Hemant Kanoria, chairman and managing director of Srei Infrastructure.         
	Tata Capital succeeded in mopping up Rs 4,200 crore through an NCD issue recently. Srei will raise the money in phases.         
	During the current fiscal, Srei plans to raise around Rs 4,500 crore to meet its disbursal target of Rs 7,500 crore. It disbursed Rs 6,620 crore in 2008-09. In the current financial year, we are targeting a growth rate of 20 per cent, said Sunil Kanoria, director of Srei Infrastructure.         
	We have internal accruals of Rs 3,000 crore. This means that we may need to mobilise around Rs 4,500 crore, he said.        
	In March this year, Srei raised $100 million (around Rs 500 crore) through external commercial borrowings.         
	Well soon raise another $100 million through ECBs, Sunil Kanoria said. The economic downturn and liquidity crisis last year affected Sreis business, particularly in the second half of 2008-09.

          OUR BUREAU                              
	Jan. 31: Unitech Ltd today reported a 74.12 per cent decline in consolidated net profit at Rs 136.05 crore for the quarter ended December 31, 2008, because of a significant slowdown in demand for commercial property.        
	The company had recorded a net profit of Rs 525.78 crore in the third quarter of the last fiscal, the realty firm said in a statement. Total income fell 56.48 per cent to Rs 507 crore during the period under review from Rs 1,165.11 crore a year ago.        
	Cash-starved real estate companies are expected to see an average fall of 30 per cent in net profit and a 10 per cent fall in topline in the third quarter of 2008-09 as developers battle slowing property sales and a tight credit scenario, said analysts.        
	The last quarter witnessed a dramatic change in the macro-economic environment. It was characterised by tight liquidity conditions and a demand slowdown across segments, Unitech managing director Sanjay Chandra said.        
	M amp;M show        
	Mahindra amp; Mahindra (M amp;M) today said its consolidated net profit for the third quarter ended December 31 plunged 93.37 per cent to Rs 26.7 crore, mainly on account of foreign exchange losses. The company had a net profit of Rs 402.9 crore for the same quarter in fiscal 2008.        
	Excluding the impact of the exchange loss and the exceptional profit, profit after tax during the quarter is Rs 121.3 crore against Rs 238.8 crore in the third quarter last year, the company said.        
	The gross revenue and other income of the company dropped to Rs 6,354 crore for the quarter ended December 31 from Rs 6,774.1 crore in the same quarter last year.        
	Grasim net        
	Grasim Industries today said its consolidated net profit fell 36.26 per cent to Rs 459.55 crore in the third quarter of the current fiscal from Rs 720.99 crore in the year-ago quarter. However, the consolidated total income rose to Rs 4,702.69 crore in the latest quarter from Rs 4,426.64 crore a year ago.

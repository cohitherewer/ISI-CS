The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Ruia to set up metro coach unit in Bengal
                                                                                                               Ruia to set up metro coach unit in Bengal
          SAMBIT SAHA                          Ruia: Plans on track                                  
	Calcutta, Aug. 24: Pawan K. Ruia, the owner of wagon manufacturer Jessop and tyre maker Dunlop, plans to build a metro rail coach factory in Bengal.        
	Ruia today met railway minister Mamata Banerjee in Delhi and disclosed his plan to build a plant at an investment of Rs 1,000 crore.        
	The meeting assumes significance as Ruia got a ticking off from Mamata last week for a delay in restarting the Sahagunj factory of Dunlop.        
	The minister had also quizzed Ruia on Jessops inability to deliver wagons to the railways.        
	It is learnt that Mamata wanted to have a closed-door interaction with Ruia after the public outburst, which more than surprised sections of the city business community.        
	When contacted by The Telegraph, Ruia said he spent about 90 minutes with the minister and the meeting was positive.        
	She enquired in detail about the issues with Dunlop and Jessop, he said.        
	The minister also wanted to know if Ruia had plans for any fresh investment in Bengal.        
	I told her we were interested in building a new and modern metro coach factory if the railways supported the venture, he said.        
	Around 300-400 acres will be needed to build the plant. Possible locations were discussed, too, at the meeting.        
	Ruia said the project could employ around 4,000 people when fully operational.        
	However, an assurance from the railways would be critical for making the project viable.        
	Ruia sought a comfort letter from the railways on buying coaches if they were price competitive and of good quality.        
	The minister has reportedly asked him to come back with concrete proposals.        
	Indian Railways and the Union ministry of urban development are planning several metro railway projects.        
	Private railway component makers such as Texmaco are eyeing this big business opportunity.         
	A metro coach factory can also make coaches for local trains.        
	India has two indigenous state-owned coach manufacturing units, at Perambur in Chennai (Integral Coach Factory) and at Kapurthala in Punjab.        
	Bombardier Inc of the US has recently set up a unit in Gujarat.        
	The industry expects demand to grow manifold providing opportunities to many players such as Jessop and Texmaco.

	New Delhi, Feb. 16: Industry is disappointed with the interim budget in the absence of stimulus measures.         
	Its a lacklustre budget. There is nothing to react as it is a vote-on-account. It is disappointing for industry and the economy, said Rahul Bajaj, chairman of Bajaj Auto.         
	The present government could have at least set an agenda for the next government, said Phiroz Adi Vandrevala, executive director of Tata Consultancy Services.        
	Gems and jewellery manufacturers said the government had done for them.        
	There is nothing in the budget, except for the interest subsidy, said Vasant Mehta, chairman of the Gems amp; Jewellery Export Promotion Council of India. The tenure of the subsidy scheme has been extended to September from March.        
	ICICI Bank said the government had not taken any steps to boost consumption.        
	What is important is to propel consumption mainly through cuts in interest rates. Somehow it does not seem to be happening, said Chanda Kochhar, joint managing director and CFO of ICICI Bank.        
	Realty, too, was unhappy. Pradeep Jain, chairman of Parsvnath Developers, said, It was completely (a) non-event. It was (more a) political statement than an interim budget. There was nothing for any sector, forget about real estate.        
	Anything which is new will come only when a new government comes, said Nandan Nilekani, chairman of Infosys Technologies.        
	Meanwhile, industry chambers such as the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry and the Confederation of Indian Industry said the budget was along expected lines.        
	The interim budget is well within expectation. We did not expect any major policy guidelines or projections, said Venu Srinivasan, president-designate of the CII.        
	However, others were more vocal. The interim budget was a major disappointment, said PHDCCI president Satish Bagrodia.         
	Ganesh Natarajan, chairman of IT body Nasscom, said the government should have ensured the spending of the allocated funds for the industry to boost domestic demand. For IT, the much expected tax reliefs failed to materialise.

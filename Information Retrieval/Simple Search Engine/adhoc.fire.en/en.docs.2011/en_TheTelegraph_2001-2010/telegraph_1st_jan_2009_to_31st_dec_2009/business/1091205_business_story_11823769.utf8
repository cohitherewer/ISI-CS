	New Delhi, Dec. 4: The JSW group plans to acquire coal mines abroad in the next 12 months and is likely to spend around $500 million to secure supply to its growing steel and power businesses.        
	We are in talks and are looking at mines in Australia, Indonesia and South Africa, JSW Energy chairman Sajjan Jindal said.         
	Sources said talks were on with potential miners and a deal could be clinched within the next 6-12 months. The firm is exploring the options of acquisition, joint venture or a long-term contract.        
	The group will import about 6.5 million tonnes (mt) of coal in this fiscal and about 10mt in the next to partially meet the requirement of its steel and power plants.         
	Of the planned import, JSW Steel will ship in 4.5mt in the current fiscal and about 5mt in the next. JSW Energy will import 2mt in 2009-10 and another 5mt in the next fiscal.        
	Out of JSW Energys 5mt, 2mt will come from Indonesia, 2mt from South Africa and 1mt from Australia, he said.        
	The company plans to increase its power generation capacity to 11,500MW in the next six years from 800MW.

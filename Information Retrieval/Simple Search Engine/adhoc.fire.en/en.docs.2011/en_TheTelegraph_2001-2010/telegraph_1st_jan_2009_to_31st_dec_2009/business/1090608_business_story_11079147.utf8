The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Advantage Sterlite in Asarco
                                                                                                               Advantage Sterlite in Asarco
          SAMBIT SAHA                           Plot thickens                                  
	Calcutta, June 7: The battle for the control of copper miner Asarco, which involves Indias Sterlite Industries, has taken a new turn with a US bankruptcy court allowing the American company to settle environment claims worth $1.1 billion.         
	Justice Richard Schimdt of Southern Court of Texas has approved the plan, whereby Tuscan, Arizona-based Asarco would pay up creditors.         
	Grupo Mexico, the estranged parent of Asarco, was opposing the plan. The Mexican miner had offered $2.9 billion to revive Asarco, trumping Sterlites bid of $1.7 billion.         
	Grupo had mustered the support of the creditors claiming compensation from Asarco for asbestos-related environmental damages. They had backed Grupos restructuring plan as the Mexican company had offered to strike a deal with them.         
	Sterlite was supported by Asarco workers union with whom the Indian company signed an agreement last year. NRI billionaire Anil Agarwals company also gained support from a section of the US federal government. Asarcos present management is also in favour of the Sterlite plan.         
	According to experts, the environment clean-up deal will pave the way for a faster restructuring of Asarco, which had filed Chapter 11 bankruptcy in 2005 to seek protection against environmental claims.         
	The court judgment means the US government and a group of states will drop any legal action against the company related to pollution in at least 19 states.         
	Asarco had faced $7.9 billion in claims. The companys main creditors are government agencies seeking payment for environmental clean-up and individuals who allege injuries from asbestos exposure.         
	The state and federal agencies originally claimed that Asarco owed them $6.5 billion. About $3 billion worth of those claims were settled for $513 million, while the remaining $3.5 billion were disposed of with Schmidts ruling. With the creditors out of the way, Sterlite could now be on the high ground in the bid battle.         
	Grupo lost control of Asarco in 2005 when an independent board took charge of the US company. The Mexican company has been accused of pushing Asarco into bankruptcy by stripping it of its most valuable assets  shares in Southern Copper of Peru.         
	Grupo has already lost a lawsuit in a US court, which ordered the company to return 260 million shares of Southern Copper and pay up $1.36 billion in cash. Grupo has appealed against the order.         
	Harbinger  a US-based hedge fund and one of Asarcos largest bondholders  has opposed Grupos bid to acquire Asarco as it would allow the Mexican company to retain the damages coming out of the lawsuit pertaining to Southern Copper.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Tea firms expect higher prices next year
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Tea firms expect higher prices next year
          SOUNAK MITRA                                            
	Calcutta, Dec. 28: The Indian tea industry is poised to start the coming year with a shortage of over 60 million kg, which is likely to result in a higher price realisation in 2010.        
	While the major producers in the country are hopeful that prices will be strong next year, the Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) of the United Nations had last week projected that prices globally would ease in 2010.        
	Tea prices reached record levels this year but should ease in 2010 as weather patterns returned to normal in the main tea-producing regions of Asia and Africa, the FAO said in its latest report.        
	Indian Tea Association chairman Aditya Khaitan said, Even if the crop is very good next year, the shortage will not be made up so early. So prices will be strong next year. Khaitan is also the managing director of McLeod Russel, which produces 96 million kg of bulk tea, the largest in the world.        
	According to experts estimate, a shortage of 10 million kg in production this year will be added to 30 million kg of shortage from last year, resulting in a gap of almost 40 million kg in 2010. With domestic consumption going up about 20-30 million kg, the total shortfall will be over 60 million kg.         
	Surplus stocks started depleting gradually from 2003. While stocks increased from 53 million kg in 2000 to 67 million kg in 2003, they came down to 26 million kg in 2006.         
	The FAO Tea Composite price, the indicative world price for black tea, reached a high of $3.18 a kilogram in September amid drought conditions in India, Sri Lanka and Kenya, underpinned by increased demand, compared with an average price of $2.38 per kilogram in 2008.        
	The concern that FAO is raising is that producers can over-react to the current high prices by planting more crops. Industry sources said the global shortage was at 165 million kg now. According to industry estimates, output is likely to be lower by about 140 million kg this year.         
	According to official statistics, which are different from the estimates of experts, deficit in Africa and Sri Lanka stood at 70 million kg currently, while India is likely to end the year with a shortage of 50 million kg.         
	Taking into account a 25 million kg shortage for India at the beginning of the year, the industry is staring at a shortage of a little more than 140 million kg.        
	Kenyas production during January-October declined 11 per cent to 242.2 million kg, compared with the same period a year earlier, according to the Tea Board of Kenya. Kenya is the largest exporter of black tea.        
	During January-September, world production stood at 1,275.5 million kg, down by about 89 million kg.         
	Production in January-September fell 1.4 per cent to 696.7 million kg, lower 10 million kg over the last year. In the first five months of 2009, the shortfall in production over the previous year was almost 13 million kg.        
	During January-September, tea witnessed a better price realisation in the export market at Rs 135.42 per kg against Rs 111.93 per kg in the same period last year.        
	Tea prices in India are at least 15 per cent, or Rs 20 a kg, lower compared with that of the international markets, Khaitan said.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                            
	Mumbai, April 9: The slowdown heat is on Mastek Ltd which came out with lower third-quarter numbers today.        
	The software services company reported a net profit of Rs 33.4 crore for the third quarter ended March 31, 2009, a decline of 4.84 per cent from Rs 35.1 crore in the corresponding quarter last year.         
	Total income during the quarter was Rs 233 crore compared with Rs 238.9 crore in the same quarter last year. In January, Mastek had estimated the net profit for the period to be Rs 32-33 crore.        
	It attributed the decline in revenues to the weakened pound  the UK is Masteks largest market  and the impact of the recession on its clients.        
	There have also been delays in starting new projects. Contributions from new projects will be reflected from the July-September quarter, the company said.        
	On a sequential basis, the companys total income represents a 9 per cent decline from Rs 256.2 crore in the preceding quarter.        
	Sudhakar Ram, chairman and managing director of Mastek, said, Our performance for the quarter demonstrates our ability to maintain profitability without under- investing for future growth, even as the prevailing economic scenario remains tough and exchange rate headwinds continue to impact our operations.        
	He said while the company was witnessing some challenges in demand and pricing, it had been able to add new clients from the government and insurance sectors. Its non-life insurance division has also been doing well.        
	During the nine-month period, the company experienced some slowdown in demand as well as pricing pressure, mainly in its services-led accounts.        
	For the April-June quarter, it has estimated the consolidated total income (inclusive of other income) to be in the range of Rs 220-230 crore.         
	Net profit after tax and minority interest is likely to be around Rs 30-32 crore.

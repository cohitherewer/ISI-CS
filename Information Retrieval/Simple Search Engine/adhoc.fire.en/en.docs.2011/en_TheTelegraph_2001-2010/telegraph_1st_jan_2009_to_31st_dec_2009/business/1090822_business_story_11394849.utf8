The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Food import to bridge gap in supply
                                                                                                               Food import to bridge gap in supply
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      Pranab Mukherjee in  New Delhi on Friday. (PTI)                          
	New Delhi, Aug. 21: The government will import foodgrains that may be in short supply because of the drought and provide loans at 4 per cent rate to sugarcane farmers affected by the below-normal monsoon.        
	It is an extraordinary situation. The government will take all necessary steps, including imports, finance minister Pranab Mukherjee told the state agriculture ministers here.        
	Whichever commodity will be in short supply, to maintain a demand-supply mechanism, we shall go for imports. Already, there is a short supply of pulses and edible oil, he said.        
	The government will give loans at 4 per cent interest to sugarcane farmers through sugar mills to help them buy quality seeds, fertilisers and pesticides.        
	These would be disbursed by the food ministry from the sugar development fund. The mills will pass on the lower rate benefit to the growers by March 31, 2010.         
	Under the scheme, the mills will have to repay the loan along with interest in four years and in four equal annual installments. Farmers currently get loans from state- run banks at 7 per cent.        
	Besides, the government will give loans at 4 per cent interest to the mills to buy machinery for processing raw sugar.        
	Mukherjee said the government would not announce the date of import in advance so that prices were not jacked up artificially by the global players. The moment news is spread that India is going for big import, prices are jacked up.         
	India needs to import 4 million tonnes of raw sugar this year. State-run agencies STC and MMTC have been asked to buy sugar as well as pulses from the global markets in a phased manner.         
	The government has also allowed duty-free imports of crude edible oils. The country is expected to import 7-7.5 million tonnes by October-end. It has already extended the duty-free imports of pulses through to March 2010.         
	India produces about 15mt of pulses, while consuming 17-18mt, meeting the shortfall through imports.        
	Rain has been more than a quarter below normal this year.

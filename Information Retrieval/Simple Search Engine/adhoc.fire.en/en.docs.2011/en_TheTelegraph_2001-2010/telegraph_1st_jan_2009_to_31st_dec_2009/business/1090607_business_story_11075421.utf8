          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Tanti: Charged up                                  
	Mumbai, June 6: Wind turbine maker Suzlon Energy today said its stake in Germany-based REpower Systems AG had increased to 90.72 per cent, with the acquisition of Martifer Groups remaining 14.4 per cent in the company.        
	Suzlon has completed the acquisition of Martifer Groups stake in REpower Systems, with a final payment of 87.6 million euro (Rs 574.48 crore), Suzlon Energy said in a filing to the Bombay Stock Exchange.        
	With the conclusion of this transaction, Suzlon now holds approximately 90.72 per cent shares and voting rights in REpower Systems, it further said.        
	Portugal-based Martifer, which is engaged in metallic construction, energy equipment and electricity generation, originally held a 22.5 per cent stake in Hamburg-based REpower Systems.         
	Suzlon had already bought out around 8 per cent of Martifer stake in REpower and, under an agreement, was supposed to pick up the remaining 14.4 per cent in two stages.        
	The purchase of Martifers stake in REpower by Suzlon was agreed in February 2007.        
	The Pune-headquartered firm had paid 65 million euros as the first tranche in December last year, hiking its stake in REpower to 73.1 per cent.        
	This is the final tranche of the 270 million euros that Suzlon had agreed to pay to buy Martifers 22.4 per cent stake in REpower Systems.        
	On Friday, shares of Suzlon Energy closed at Rs 130.90, down 4.31 per cent on the BSE.         
	Suzlon chairman Tulsi Tanti said, The completion of the purchase of Martifers stake in REpower is a major milestone for Suzlon. With the transaction behind us, we will focus our efforts on building a mutually beneficial business relationship with Martifer by harnessing the complementary strengths and business models. We continue to pursue our long-term strategy for REpower and are committed to its growth and development.

	New Delhi, May 11: Pantaloon Retail has called an extraordinary general meeting tomorrow to seek the approval from shareholders to raise promoters stake to 51 per cent through a preferential issue of shares and warrants.        
	The Kishore Biyani company plans to make a preferential issue of 11 million equity shares to its promoters at Rs 183 apiece to raise Rs 201 crore. It also wants to sell 4.1 million shares to Dharmayug Investments at the same price to raise Rs 75 crore.        
	The retail chain has also proposed to issue 5 million warrants to the promoters and their associates, which can be converted into equity shares after 18 months. The price for the warrant conversion will also be Rs 183, aggregating Rs 91.5 crore.        
	At present, the promoter group  mostly Kishore Biyani and his family members  owns about 46.50 per cent of Pantaloon Retail.

	Future Fashion will run the groups fashion and private label businesses and act as a holding company for Future Consumer Enterprise Ltd that will look after the groups retail business in all formats.        
	According to managing director Kishore Biyani, the restructuring will create three distinct business segments of fashion, retailing, and FMCG and consumer durables.

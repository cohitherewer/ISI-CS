The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Ruias Falcon to spread wings
                                                                                                               Ruias Falcon to spread wings
          SAMBIT SAHA                          Ruia: Chasing No. 1 spot                                  
	Calcutta, Aug. 9: City-based Ruia Group has chalked out plans to become the largest two- and three-wheeler tyre maker in the country by expanding Mysore-based Falcon Tyres in a phased manner.         
	The group will invest Rs 1,300 crore over the next two years to increase its capacity to 2.7 million units a month.         
	It will not only make us the undisputed leader in India in two- and three-wheeler tyres, but also one of the top players globally, as well, Pawan K. Ruia told The Telegraph.         
	At present, Falcon makes 750,000 tyres at its Mysore plant and another 300,000 at its wholly owned subsidiary Monotona at Thane in Maharashtra. The tyres are sold under the Dunlop brand.         
	TVS Srichakra and MRF are the other dominant players in the two- and three-wheeler tyre segments.         
	Ruia said Falcons capacity would be increased to 900,000 pieces a month from August 15. A pact has been signed with the old workers and the company has hired 280 people. Falcon has also commissioned a Rs 300-crore expansion of its Mysore plant to take its capacity to 1.4 million pieces a month.         
	The market for two- and three-wheeler tyres is strong and we are able to get good margins, too. I do not foresee any fall in demand in medium term, Ruia said.         
	He is now planning to set up a new unit at Uttarakhand. The facility will have capacity to manufacture 500,000 units and will require an investment of around Rs 500 crore. Two wheeler-maker Hero Honda also has units there.         
	Ruia Group also plans to expand the capacity of Monotona Tyres by another 500,000 units a month, entailing an investment of another Rs 500 crore.         
	Falcons first quarter results have reinforced Ruias optimism at a time when industry is wary of investing in capacity addition.         
	The company made a profit of Rs 12.03 crore in the April-June quarter compared with Rs 6.6 crore in the whole of last year.         
	Ruia said he was confident of maintaining the margin. The Falcon scrip was the best performer on the Bombay Stock Exchange, gaining 132.94 per cent in the last month to close at Rs 848 on Friday.         
	The company has announced a stock split and an issue of bonus shares to increase liquidity. It will also offload shares to financial institutions to raise money and bring down the promoters holding below 75 per cent from 86 per cent.         
	Dunlop plan        
	After tasting success with Falcon, Ruia is making efforts to put Dunlops troubled past to rest. The company has signed a fresh wage pact with the Dunlop Factory Employees Union at Ambattur in Chennai. The plant, which employs 666, has been closed for 16 months.

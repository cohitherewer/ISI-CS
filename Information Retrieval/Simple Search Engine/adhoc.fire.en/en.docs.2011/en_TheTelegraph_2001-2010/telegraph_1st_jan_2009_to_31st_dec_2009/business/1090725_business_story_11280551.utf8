The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | SBI trims deposit rates
                                                                                                               SBI trims deposit rates
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Mumbai, July 24: The State Bank of India today reduced deposit rates by 25-50 basis points across select maturities.         
	This is the third reduction by the countrys largest bank in as many months.        
	The SBI had recently brought down its benchmark prime lending rate by 50 basis points to 11.75 per cent.         
	Banking circles, however, do not expect the SBI to cut lending rates soon.        
	Last month, the nationalised bank had slashed deposit rates by 25 basis points across all maturities; earlier these rates were lowered by 25-50 basis points in select buckets.         
	The new rates will be effective from July 27.         
	The SBI said it would offer an interest rate of 6-6.25 per cent on deposits of 181 days to less than a year.        
	Rates for deposits of 1 year to less than 2 years will now stand at 6.50 per cent against 7 per cent earlier, and they will be 7 per cent for deposits between 2 years to less than 1,000 days.

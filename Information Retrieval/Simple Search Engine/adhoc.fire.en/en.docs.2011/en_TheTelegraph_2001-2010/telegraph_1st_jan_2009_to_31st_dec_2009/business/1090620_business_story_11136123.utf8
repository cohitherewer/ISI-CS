          OUR CORRESPONDENT                          Cash call                                  
	New Delhi, June 19: The government is likely to fix the base price for 3G spectrum auctions at Rs 4,040 crore.         
	A final decision will be taken next week by the Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs.        
	Telecom minister A. Raja held discussions with finance minister Pranab Mukherjee and Prime Minister Manmohan Singh on the 3G policy today.         
	The 3G auction had been postponed thrice because of the differences among ministries over issues such as the reserve price and the number of blocks to be auctioned.        
	In its note on the 3G auction policy, the telecom department had said the reserve price could be hiked to Rs 3,540 crore from the earlier price of Rs 2,020 crore. It also proposed to auction six blocks of 3G spectrum to private operators.         
	The finance ministry had, however, demanded that the base price be set at Rs 4,020 crore.         
	A quarter of Indias 380 million mobile users are estimated to carry 3G-enabled handsets, but operators cannot offer the services as they do not have the required spectrum.

                                I dont have any idea about investments. But I want to put Rs 5,000-Rs 10,000 as a one-time investment. I shall not need the money for five years. Where can I get a good return?          Pratip Bhattacharji, Joynagar
                    With a five-year time horizon, the best investment option will be mutual funds. Choose a diversified equity mutual fund scheme that has given more than 30 per cent compounded annual return over the past five years and invest your money there. You can contact a mutual fund distributor. He/she will be able to show you which funds have given better returns in the last five years. You can also get it on www.valueresearchonline.com.                                  Lodge a complaint      My daughter and my son-in-law, both deaf and dumb, opened a savings bank account with cheque facility with the Uco Banks Lake Town branch in August 2009. In October, I met the branch manager with a requisition duly signed and authorised by my daughter for receiving the cheque book on her behalf. But the branch manager refused to accept the requisition and wanted the account holder to be present before him and write the authorised letter in her own handwriting. The branch manager also refused to talk to me on behalf of the account holders. What shall I do?        Kamal Krishna Nandi, Calcutta
                    The branch manager cannot deny accepting the authorisation letter. You can approach the higher authority of the bank at its head office near Tea Board. Or else, you can mail your complaint to hopgr.calcuttaucobank.co.in .                                  Form worry      What is the provision of law under which an assessee having tax liability will not have to submit Form 15H.         Sunil Chandra Kar, Calcutta
                    Sub-section (1) of Section 197A of the Income Tax Act states that no deduction of tax shall be made if an individual furnishes a declaration in the prescribed form and verified in the prescribed manner so that the tax on his estimated total income of the previous year will be nil.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Under scrutiny                                  
	New Delhi, Jan. 13: Prime Minister Manmohan Singh tonight held a meeting with senior cabinet ministers on Satyam.         
	The bailout package for the tainted company is believed to have topped the agenda. The government-constituted board had stated that it was not sure about Satyams working capital and how long the company could pay the salaries of over 52,000 employees.        
	Officials said state-run banks had been told to continue giving credit as a revival package gets finalised.        
	They said the government was thinking in terms of an interim credit facility.         
	A line of credit of more than Rs 500 crore from state-run banks and financial institutions was immediately being worked out for working expenses.        
	Another item on the agenda of the meeting was the need to improve the image of Indian business.         
	External affairs minister Pranab Mukherjee, home minister P. Chidambaram, commerce and industry minister Kamal Nath, corporate affairs minister P.C. Gupta and deputy chairman of Planning Commission Montek Singh Ahluwalia attended the meeting.        
	The ministers reportedly discussed bank loans backed by the government, raising of money from asset sale and Satyam issuing fresh capital to government-owned institutions.        
	Earlier in the morning, commerce minister Kamal Nath held a two-hour long meeting with Singh. The PM is closely monitoring the developments in Satyam, Nath said.         
	The commerce minister said the government could consider extending help if the company was short of funds.        
	We are considering all options and will soon announce definite steps to help the company overcome the current crisis as it is a question of saving jobs and an international brand, Nath said.

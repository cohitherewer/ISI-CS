The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Spat over gas price add-on 
                                                                                                               Spat over gas price add-on 
                              Unending tiff                            
	New Delhi, Oct. 25 (PTI): The Anil Ambani group has asked the empowered group of ministers (eGoM) to consider on Tuesday the issue of marketing margin charged by Reliance Industries on gas from its fields in the Krishna-Godavari (KG) basin and said the illegitimate levy should be stopped.        
	Reliance Industries (RIL) in a statement today has refuted the charge.        
	The seven-member eGoM is scheduled to consider the commercial utilisation of RILs KG-D6 gas and other related matters on October 27. The issue of the company charging $0.135 per million British thermal unit as a marketing margin is not on the agenda.        
	Anil Ambani group firm Reliance Infrastructure wrote to power minister Sushil Kumar Shinde on Friday to take up the issue of the levy. Shinde is on the ministers panel.        
	RIL should be directed to immediately put a stop to this illegitimate levy of marketing margin from all customers of KG-basin gas and refund the marketing margin wrongfully collected so far, Reliance Infrastructure CEO Lalit Jalan said in his letter.        
	However, RIL has debunked the allegations of an illegal marketing margin. It said the levy was to cover for risks and costs for delivering the fuel to customers and was in conformity with industry practice.        
	The marketing margin being charged by RIL on sale of KG-D6 gas is in consideration for the risks and costs beyond the delivery point in accordance with general industry practice, the company said in a statement.        
	R-Com denial        
	Anil Ambanis Reliance Communications today criticised the special audit report and said it had neither understated revenues nor evaded licence fees to be paid to the government.

          OUR CORRESPONDENT                          Incoming call                                  
	New Delhi, May 20: Norways Telenor, which completed the acquisition of a 49 per cent stake in Unitech Wireless today, has sought approval from the government to increase its stake in the company to 74 per cent.        
	Telenor has put in an application to hike its stake in Unitech Wireless to 74 per cent and invest up to Rs 11,200 crore in the telecom joint venture, said officials of the Foreign Investment Promotion Board (FIPB).         
	The FIPB, which clears all major foreign investment proposals in India, will take up Telenors proposal on Friday.        
	In the second phase of investment for the 49 per cent stake, Telenor has paid Rs 1,130 crore to Unitech Wireless for a 15.5 per cent stake, the companies said today.        
	In March, Telenor acquired a 33.5 per cent stake in Unitech Wireless by paying Rs 1,250 crore. The four-tranche deal, which will eventually take Telenors stake to 67.25 per cent, is set to be completed by the year end.        
	In addition, On May 19, 2009, Unitech Wireless has received around Rs 240 crore from Telenor as application money for additional equity shares to maintain its stake at the 49 per cent level, post conversion into equity of bonds of Rs 250 crore issued by Unitech Wireless to an Indian shareholder, the company said.        
	According to the original deal of October 2008, Telenor was to pick up a 60 per cent stake in Unitech Wireless for Rs 6,120 crore. In March, Unitech agreed to give away an additional 7.25 per cent stake at no additional cost. This helped the cash-strapped realtor to overcome a fund crunch.        
	Unitechs eight telecom subsidiaries, together referred to as Unitech Wireless, have the necessary licences and spectrum to launch services in 22 circles and plan to make a debut by the second half of 2009.        
	An experienced management team is in place, and is preparing for the launch of services during the second half of 2009, said Jon Fredrik Baksaas, president and CEO of Telenor. Telenor is the worlds seventh largest operator with over 159 million subscribers across 12 markets. It provides mobile services in Pakistan, Thailand, Bangladesh and Malaysia.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Banks in a rush to cut interest rates
                                                                                                               Banks in a rush to cut interest rates
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          D. Subbarao in New Delhi on Saturday. (PTI)                                  
	New Delhi, Feb. 28: State-run banks today went into an overdrive to cut interest rates after Reserve Bank governor D. Subbarao yesterday indicated that the central bank was waiting for more action from them.        
	Punjab National Bank (PNB), the countrys second largest state-owned bank, today reduced interest rates on new car loans by half a per cent from tomorrow. The bank will now charge 10.5-11 per cent on new car loans.        
	Union Bank went a step ahead and cut rates on home and car loans by 1 per cent and 1.5 per cent, respectively, with effect from tomorrow. The bank will charge 9.75-10.75 rate on home loans and 11-11.25 per cent on new car loans.         
	Earlier this month, the State Bank of India had reduced the interest rate on car loans to 10 per cent for a year.         
	The bank had also announced a special home loan offer at an interest rate of 8 per cent for a year for new customers. The scheme is valid till April 30.        
	Union Bank has also launched a separate scheme, under which it will offer home loans up to Rs 20 lakh at lower interest rates.        
	The scheme carries special features like free life insurance cover and will be offered free of pre-payment and processing charges, the bank said.         
	Under the scheme, loans up to Rs 5 lakh will carry an interest rate of 8.5 per cent, while for Rs 5-20 lakh, the new rate will be 9.25 per cent, the bank said.        
	The scheme will be valid till June 30 and the rates will be reset after a period of five years, a statement issued by the Union Bank said.        
	According to finance ministry officials, the RBI will announce a fresh round of rate cuts only after the banks pass on the benefits of last months reduction in repo and reverse repo rates to consumers.         
	The repo is the rate at which the central bank provides liquidity to banks. The reverse repo is the rate at which it mops up funds from banks against securities.        
	The RBI governor today held separate meetings with finance ministry officials and Montek Singh Ahluwalia, deputy chairman of the Planning Commission.         
	The meeting with Ahluwalia was to discuss macro-economic issues ahead of the G-20 meeting of finance ministers and central bank governors in mid-March.         
	In the last three months, the RBI had cut the repo rate by 3.5 percentage points to 5.5 per cent.        
	However, most banks have not passed on the benefit to borrowers and have reduced rates by less than 2 percentage points.         
	The cut has been even lower for floating home loan rates, which impact millions of households.        
	Bankers have been warding off a rate cut, complaining of lower margins and higher provisioning ratios.         
	Most bankers feel a rate cut is possible only by the end of March, whereas the government and the RBI want the rates to come down immediately.                                
	PSU banks had been told by the finance ministry to cut rates by mid-February. State-run banks charge about 10-12.5 per cent from home loan borrowers and 11.5-12.5 per cent from car buyers. Private banks charge at least 1-4 per cent more. If rates charged by state-run banks come down further it would put pressure on private banks such as ICICI and ABN Amro to follow suit.        
	Lack of consumer demand have added to the woes of the automobile and housing sectors reeling under the impact of the global meltdown. The rate cuts are expected to boost demand and revive the economy that grew just 5.3 per cent for the quarter ended December.

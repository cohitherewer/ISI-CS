	New Delhi, Oct. 18: Bankers expect the economic revival coupled with a stable interest rate regime to push up loan demand to over 20 per cent in the next two quarters.         
	They are also hopeful that the regulators will refrain from increasing lending rates as the easy availability of cheap credit is considered crucial for the economy to attain high growth rates.         
	Private banking major HDFC Bank expects a loan growth of around 25 per cent. We see a good growth in loan disbursals in the next few quarters. The bank expects an overall 20-25 per cent growth in loan disbursals in 2009-10, said Deepak Parekh, chairman of HDFC Bank.        
	Bank credit grew only 12.62 per cent in the first half of this fiscal.        
	Current lending rates are conducive to increased credit demand, specifically in infrastructure, retail and auto sectors. This can hike credit demand to the range of 22-24 per cent between November 2009 and March 2010, Vikram Kotak, chief investment officer of Birla Sun Life Insurance, told The Telegraph.        
	Key economic data such as the recent index of industrial production (IIP) have indicated a swift revival.        
	Factory output grew the highest in 22 months at 10.4 per cent in August. Domestic car sales increased 14.51 per cent during the first half of the fiscal, indicating a rise in consumption.         
	According to K.K. Sharma, executive director of The Bank of Rajasthan, IIP data released for August indicate a revival. Positive signals in quite a few retail segments such as housing, cars and auto loans signify that demand for credit is likely to pick up.         
	Bankers also do not expect the Reserve Bank of India to tinker with policy rates in its upcoming monetary policy statement on October 27.         
	K.V. Kamath, chairman of ICICI Bank, said, If you look at the global context, I think monetary policy is in an easy state and I dont think that the liquidity situation globally is going to change. In India, too, we have a similar situation where liquidity is very easy at this point in time. As far as tightening rates are concerned, I do not think that we will see anything happening for the next 9-12 months.         
	C. Rangarajan, the chairman of the Prime Ministers economic advisory council, had said that the RBI might leave interest rates unchanged in its monetary policy and would prefer to wait for a further clarity on inflation before reversing its accommodative stance.        
	RBIs repo and reverse repo rates are currently at 4.75 per cent and 3.25 per cent, respectively. Repo rate is the rate at which the central bank lends to banks to inject liquidity, while reverse repo rate is one at which it borrows from banks to absorb excess liquidity from the system.

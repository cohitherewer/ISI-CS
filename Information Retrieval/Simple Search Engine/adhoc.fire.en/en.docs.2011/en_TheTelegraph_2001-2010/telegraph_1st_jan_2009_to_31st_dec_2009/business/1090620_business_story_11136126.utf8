          Our Special Correspondent                          Salman Khurshid in New Delhi on Friday.                                         
	New Delhi, June 19: Small and medium enterprises in the country face a tough challenge in the changed global environment, corporate affairs minister Salman Khurshid said today.        
	The protection that the SME sector is getting from the government could be challenged with the coming of WTO norms, Khurshid said while releasing the Businessworlds SME Whitebook. Businessworld is an ABP group publication.        
	He said the global recession had hit SMEs the hardest.         
	Khurshid asked the SMEs to be cost-competitive and innovative.        
	About 12.8 million small and medium enterprises in the country provide jobs to over 42 million people and account for 45 per cent of the countrys factory output and nearly 40 per cent of exports.        
	Exports, which had contracted in the past few months, are showing signs of stability and are expected to pick up by the year-end.

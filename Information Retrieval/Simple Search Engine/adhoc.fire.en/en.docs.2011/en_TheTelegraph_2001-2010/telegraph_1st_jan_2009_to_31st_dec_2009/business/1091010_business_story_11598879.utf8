The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Tata Motors raises $750m
                                                                                                               Tata Motors raises $750m
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Cash pursuit                                  
	Mumbai, Oct. 9: Tata Motors today raised $750 million through global depository shares (GDS) and convertible notes. The proceeds will be mainly used to repay the debt taken last year to finance the buyout of Jaguar Land Rover (JLR).        
	The Tata group company said it had issued 29,904,306 equity shares in the form of GDS, which were priced at $12.54 apiece aggregating $375 million. Similarly, it issued 3,750 convertible notes due 2014 at a price of $100,000 per note, aggregating $375 million.         
	The GDS and the convertible notes will be listed on the Luxembourg Stock Exchange.        
	According to Tata Motors, the offering was successfully executed against the backdrop of volatile equity market conditions. However, the offering met with strong investor interest resulting in the book being closed in less than an hour of the launch, generating a demand of $1.25 billion from 40 investors.         
	The deal size was increased to $750 million from a base of $600 million, the company said.        
	The GDS pricing represents a 1.5 per cent discount to Tata Motors closing price on October 8 of Rs 589.25 on the NSE, while the notes were issued with a yield to maturity of 5.5 per cent.        
	Tata Motors will use the proceeds to repay the outstanding debt of $700 million for the JLR buyout. Tata Motors had acquired JLR last year for $2.5 billion.        
	Part of the money will be used as capital expenditure, working capital and for other general corporate purposes.         
	Sources said the GDS issue could lead to an equity dilution of around 6 per cent. Analysts estimated the consolidated debt of Tata Motors at over Rs 20,000 crore.         
	This transaction is a re-affirmation of investor confidence in the automotive sector and bears testimony to the trust reposed in the long term outlook and performance of Tata Motors, Ravi Kant, vice-chairman of Tata Motors, said.        
	The good news, however, was not reflected in the Tata Motors scrip which lost 6.7 per cent to close at Rs 548.30.

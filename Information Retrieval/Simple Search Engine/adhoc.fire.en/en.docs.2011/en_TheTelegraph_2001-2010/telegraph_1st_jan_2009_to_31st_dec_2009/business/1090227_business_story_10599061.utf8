The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Setback to govt in Maytas Infra
                                                                                                               Setback to govt in Maytas Infra
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                                            
	New Delhi, Feb. 26: The company law board (CLB) today rejected the ministry of corporate affairs plea for disbanding the entire board of Maytas Infra and instead proposed expanding the present body by four.        
	Three of the board members can be independent directors, while the fourth can be a representative of financial institutions that have huge exposure to the infrastructure firm, the CLB said.         
	The board currently has just three members.         
	Maytas Infra is promoted by the family of Satyam Computer founder B. Ramalinga Raju whose proposal to merge it with Satyam sparked a shareholders revolt, culminating in Rajus confession of a Rs 7,100-crore fraud in the software firm.        
	Financial lenders ICICI Bank and IDBI have massive exposures in Maytas Infra in loans and bank guarantees, said the advocates representing the lenders.         
	The CLB wants to appoint a representative from these two lenders on the board.        
	A final order will be passed tomorrow, after all parties, including Maytas Infra, replies to the CLBs proposal.         
	The law board has decided to reserve its order on Maytas Properties till Tuesday.        
	The government-run Industrial Finance Corporation of India, which has a 17.4 per cent stake in Maytas Infra, and IL amp;FS are eager to be nominated on the board. However, the CLB is against allowing a berth to IL amp;FS because of a conflict of interest.         
	In a petition before the CLB, Maytas Infra has said that the IL amp;FS was its competitor in many projects.         
	IDBI and ICICI Bank had earlier decided to keep away from the board.         
	They had said that their money was locked in projects for which Maytas had created special purpose vehicles. A board seat would be of little help. We are not in the business of running a company. We are basically lenders. Our primary concern is to get back our money, said a senior bank officer.        
	Lenders with exposure to Maytas Infra want the government to ensure that clients do not cancel contracts and that Maytas Infra completes the projects in time.        
	Maytas constructs roads, bridges and industrial structures. It is also into oil and gas exploration as well as power generation and transmission.        
	Some of its 62 projects include the prestigious Hyderabad Metro (Rs 12,000 crore), 1,050MW thermal power plant in Orissa (Rs 5,000 crore), Machilipatnam Port (Rs 1,650 crore) and Godavari Drinking Water Supply Scheme (Rs 810 crore). The Metro rail project and Machilipatnam port project are virtually off the table as the state government has decided to review all the projects awarded to the firm.         
	Maytas today filed a criminal case against Vedanta Aluminium and eight of its employees in a local court for fraudulently encashing bank guarantees worth Rs 47 crore. The company has filed the case in the city criminal court in Hyderabad under sections 403, 406 and 420 of Indian Penal Code for criminal breach of trust, cheating and criminal conspiracy.        
	Board meet        
	Goldman Sachs and Avendus, investment bankers to Satyam Computer, are learnt to have proposed majority stake sale in the IT company to a strategic investor.        
	According to a source, the Satyam board, which met today in Hyderabad, is understood to have discussed the proposal and will approach market regulator Sebi on Monday on the pricing issue. After getting the green signal from Sebi, it will invite expressions of interest from bidders.        
	According to the source, the investment bankers in their presentation said it would be better to dilute 51 per cent equity, which should include 31 per cent through the preferential route and 20 per cent via an open offer.

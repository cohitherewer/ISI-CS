          A STAFF REPORTER                                            
	Calcutta, June 11: The tea industry is facing a tough time  exports declined around 4 per cent in April, while production dropped about 22 per cent.        
	The unfavourable weather is the main reason for the fall in production, which is a big concern for the industry, a spokesperson for the Indian Tea Association (ITA) said.         
	The situation will worsen if the declining trend continues, he said.        
	Production dipped around 22 per cent to 62.59 million kg in April compared with 80.1 million kg in the same month last year, according to the ITA figures.         
	The April numbers pulled down total production by 15 per cent to 144.5 million kg during the January-April period.         
	According to the ITA data, output had touched 170 million kg between January and April last year.         
	Production in March 2009 had fallen 11 per cent to 45.03 million kg from 50.54 million kg in the same month last year. Exports have fallen because of firm internal demand and the global economic downturn, a Tea Board official said.         
	India mainly exports CTC tea to Egypt, Pakistan and the UK and the premium orthodox variety to Iraq, Iran and Russia. Total exports in April 2009 stood at 11.4 million kg against 11.86 million kg a year ago.

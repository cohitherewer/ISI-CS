The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | New SAP tool betters search function
                                                                                                               New SAP tool betters search function
          SOUNAK MITRA                               
	New Delhi, July 26: Enterprise solutions software leader SAP is banking on its business objects explorer tool to power sales.        
	The software functions the way search engine leader Google mines data.         
	SAP BusinessObjects Explorer can pull out any set of desired information in a well-presentable form, Sanjay Deshmukh, SAP India vice-president (business user and platform), said.         
	The German company is guided by the principle of transparency in product development.        
	Clear or uncluttered enterprises operate with increased speed, strategies, process, and business network quickly in response to changing market conditions, SAP India managing director Ranjan Das said on the sidelines of the SAP World Tour, which is to be conducted in 100 cities across 50 countries.         
	Earlier this month, SAP had announced mashups that connected with nine websites, including Google, to offer its SAP Business ByDesign customers increased operational capability. The nine web services are available to users in the US, UK, China, France, Germany, and India.         
	A mashup is a web page or an application that combines data or functionality from two or more external sources to create a new service.         
	The effort comes with an attempt of enterprise vendors to make their software simple for a variety of users.         
	Companies now expect to use software without training their employees.         
	Big market         
	According to a Gartner report, the business intelligence market will grow to $357 million by 2009. In India, the market is estimated at around $17.9 million for 2009 and expected to reach $20.6 million by 2010.         
	Explorer was launched targeting the retail and consumers product goods, financial services and telecom sector.        
	Referring to the prospects of technology-led solutions for retail in India, Sandeep Shirodkar, vice-president (service industry and solution group), SAP Asia Pacific Japan said, The Indian retail market is vast and modern retail is making its presence felt in a big way across big, mid-size and small cities. This definitely throws up challenges for retailers to manage and run their businesses across vast geographical boundaries.                           
	SAP said it targets to reduce its total corporate carbon footprint by 49 per cent of its year-2007 baseline, back to its year-2000 level, by the end of 2020. The company reduced its total corporate carbon footprint by 6.7 per cent in 2008.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Citi to go without govt aid
                                                                                                               Citi to go without govt aid
                                          
	Washington, May 8 (PTI): The Citigroup said it would not need more federal funds to plug the gap and would generate the same through an expanded public exchange offer.        
	Citi is among the 10 leading American entities which have been directed by the government to boost their capital, following the stress tests.        
	The Vikram Pandit-led Citi will expand its public exchange offer to raise the additional $5.5 billion capital.        
	The move would help the entity to boost the capital base without additional federal funds or conversion of the governments securities into common shares.        
	Citi will increase the maximum amount of preferred securities and trust preferred securities that it will accept in exchange for common stock from $27.5 billion to $33 billion to further increase Tier I common (capital).

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Drifting away                                  
	Mumbai, April 28: Britannia Industries will buy out its partner Fonterra Brands from their joint venture  Britannia New Zealand Foods Pvt Ltd (BNZF).        
	The company has entered into an agreement with Fonterra Brands (Mauritius Holding) to acquire the latters 49 per cent equity and preference share holding in BNZF, the joint venture firm engaged in dairy business, Britannia said in a filing with the Bombay Stock Exchange.        
	Britannia, however, did not disclose the financial details of the deal. The acquisition is subject to Reserve Banks approval.        
	The development comes only days after Britannia ended its 15-year association with Groupe Danone of France.        
	The joint venture of Fonterra and Britannia has created strong foundation in the dairy business, with leadership in categories like cheese. Britannia intends to pursue profitable growth opportunities in differential dairy products, Britannia Industries managing director Vinita Bali said.        
	While we are seeing a lot of growth in India, given the fragmented local milk supply that requires significant development, investing in Indias consumer dairy market is not a core priority for Fonterra at this time, senior Fonterra official Mark Wilson said.         
	BNZF was floated in 2002 by Britannia and Fonterra Co-operative Group of New Zealand.        
	The company focuses entirely on dairy business, with cheese being its flagship product. All products are marketed under the Britannia Milkman brand.        
	Fonterra is New Zealands largest company and among the 10 large dairy firms in the world.         
	Shares of Britannia Industries settled at Rs 1,565.60,up 1.44 per cent on the BSE today.

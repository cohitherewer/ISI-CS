With lsquo;NASSCOM Connect rsquo;, delegates can benefit from the following:      Connect with delegates 	before and after the event.      Meet delegates who are 	attending the same sessions to discuss similar experiences and 	challenges around the topic.

Powerful Search Features 	will enable finding new delegates of specific skills, interests and 	geographic location.       
	 In Mumbai, NASSCOM CONNECT will have all that is needed to give an opportunity to delegates, exhibitors, speakers, editors and analysts to introduce, network, ideate and Engage with each other prior to arriving at the event.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | JSW Steel to close US mill
                                                                                                               JSW Steel to close US mill
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Calcutta, May 19: JSW Steel may mothball a 1.2-million-tonne plate plant in the US because of a low demand for the product.        
	The unit, located in Texas, is now running at 10 to 15 per cent capacity as the demand from customers such as ship building firms is low.        
	A final decision could be taken by the end of this month. The mill has a staff of 300 employees.        
	The company maintains it will not cut any jobs at the plant. It may utilise the idle time to refurbish and modernise the mill.        
	In 2007, the Indian steel producer acquired the plate and pipe mill in the US for $1.1 billion.        
	Prithviraj Jindal  elder brother of Sajjan Jindal, who manages JSW Group  owns these mills in the US.        
	However, the economic downturn has forced end-users to delay or postpone projects in the oil and gas sectors, hurting demand.        
	Many plants in Europe and America have either cut production or shut down plants as global steel consumption is projected to fall 15 per cent.        
	Recently, Corus, which is owned by Tata Steel, begun talks with workers to shut the Teesside cast products plant in the UK.        
	JSW, a maker of long and flat steel products, slipped into net loss in the fourth quarter, mainly because of inventory write-downs in the US.        
	The company had originally planned to export semi-finished steel (slab) to the US plate mill for sale in the local market there.         
	JSW suffered a consolidated net loss of Rs 39.93 crore ($8.3 million) for the January-March quarter, compared with a net profit of Rs 357 crore in the year-ago period as it wrote down $59 million (Rs 289 crore) of inventory at its US unit.        
	For the full year, JSW Steel posted a profit of Rs 274.91 crore compared with Rs 1,640.04 crore in 2007-08.

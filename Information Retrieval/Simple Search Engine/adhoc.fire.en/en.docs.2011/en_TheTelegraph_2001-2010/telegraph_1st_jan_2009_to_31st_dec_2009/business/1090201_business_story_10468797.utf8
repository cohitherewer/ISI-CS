The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Jet fuel prices cut by 4%
                                                                                                               Jet fuel prices cut by 4%
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Jan. 31: State-run oil companies today slashed aviation turbine fuel (ATF) by around 4 per cent with effect from midnight tonight.        
	In Delhi, jet fuel price has been reduced to Rs 30,288 per kilolitre from Rs 31496 per kl, while in Mumbai, it has been cut to Rs 31,176 per kl from Rs 32,447 per kl.        
	This is the ninth time jet fuel rates have been slashed since September last year after international crude oil prices started to decline. On January 16, however, there was a 3.3 per cent increase in rates.         
	The fall in ATF prices by over 55 per cent from April 2005 levels has prompted many airlines to cut fares to boost sagging passenger traffic. However, industry sources said the latest round of cuts might not attract any substantial reduction in fares. ATF accounts for more than 45 per cent of an airlines costs.         
	Last week, Air India announced a promotional fare of Rs 99 on its economy class tickets for major domestic routes. However, these low-cost fares are limited to a few seats on each route. A Delhi-Chennai, Mumbai-Chennai and Calcutta-Chennai ticket on Air India will cost Rs 3,024, including taxes.

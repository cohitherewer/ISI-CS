          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Calcutta, June 6: French engineering group Schneider Electric will buy Indian metering firm Conzerv Systems to expand local operations.        
	The $20-billion French firm has signed an agreement with the Bangalore-based company, but no transaction details were disclosed.         
	We want to design and manufacture in India, Schneider managing director (India) Oliver Blum said. The company will also export Conzerv products to overseas markets, he said.        
	Schneider  which makes switches and electricity distribution gear  had launched a cost-reduction programme in January, including job cuts, to protect margins and dividends during the economic downturn.        
	It has forecast a 15 per cent fall in sales for 2009, and has warned of a challenging June quarter.

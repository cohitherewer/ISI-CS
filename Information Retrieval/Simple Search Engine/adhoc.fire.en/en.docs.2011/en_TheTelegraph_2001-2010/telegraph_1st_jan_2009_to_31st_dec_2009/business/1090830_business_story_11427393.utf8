The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Plan panel to review tea fund 
                                                                                                               Plan panel to review tea fund 
          A STAFF REPORTER                                    
	Calcutta, Aug. 29: The special purpose tea fund (SPTF) is likely to come under the scanner of the Planning Commission after the panels meeting on September 7. The effectiveness of the scheme was recently criticised by the commerce ministry.        
	If a scheme is not performing well, the Planning Commission may modify the scheme after the first phase of the mid-term review, Tea Board chairman Basudeb Banerjee said on the sidelines of the annual general meeting of the Tea Association of India today.        
	The Tea Board is also planning to reward companies that have benefited from the special tea fund, Banerjee said.         
	We need to increase the exposure of SPTF. About 60-70 per cent of the fund needs to be disbursed this year, the chairman said.        
	We are sending a proposal to increase subsidies by 15 per cent over and above the 25 per cent given earlier. But that will only be applicable to those who have performed well, Tea Board deputy chairman Roshni Sen said.        
	SPTF is a 15-year programme under the Tea Board for funding replantation and rejuvenation activities. After the replantation of old bushes, the average yield per hectare is expected to go up to 3,000 kg from 1,700 kg. This also means that the effective cost of plantation will come down by half, Banerjee said.         
	The SN Menon Committee  set up by the commerce ministry to study the competitiveness of the tea industry recently made a few recommendations.         
	The committee suggested that while state land laws should be amended, there was also a need to replace old bushes. The panel expressed its worry over the poor response to SPTF.         
	According to the committee, state laws must be amended for greater flexibility in land use, enabling the industry to create alternative sources of income during the lean season.         
	On the impact of the free trade agreement with Asean, Banerjee said, We have asked the ministry to include social cost as part of our mechanism to prevent the possible adverse effects of Asean.

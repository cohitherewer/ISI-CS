          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, May 9: Cairn India will ship crude from the KG Basin to the Bongaigaon refinery in Assam. The UK firm is also ready to start production from its Rajasthan fields by May-end.        
	The Ravva oil field in KG Basin is estimated to produce 1.45 million tonnes of crude. The government has nominated the Bongaigaon refinery to receive the entire crude this fiscal, sources said. If production exceeds 1.45 million tonnes in the current fiscal, crude will be supplied to HPCLs Visakhapatnam refinery.         
	The company plans to start production from the Rajasthan fields once it gets the approval from partner ONGC for field investments and if the government is able to find buyers for the oil. Our facilities will be ready to start production by the end of May, subject to partner (ONGC) and government approvals and finalisation of crude sales agreements with government nominees, a Cairn spokesperson said.

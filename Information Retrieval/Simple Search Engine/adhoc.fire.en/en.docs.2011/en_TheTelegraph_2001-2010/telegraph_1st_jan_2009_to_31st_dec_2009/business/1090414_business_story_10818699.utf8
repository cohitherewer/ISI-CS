	Mumbai, April 13 (PTI): Kishore Biyani-promoted Pantaloon Retail will raise about Rs 1,500 crore through a mix of preferential allotment of shares to promoters and private equity funding.        
	In a major realignment exercise of the BSE-listed entity, the board of directors has proposed multiple subsidiaries to focus on specific business segments.        
	Following its board meeting today, Pantaloon Retail is likely to be rechristened Future Market and Consumer Group Ltd (FMCG Ltd), Future Group founder and CEO Kishore Biyani said today.        
	The proposed company, FMCG Ltd, will be the holding company for our two main subsidiaries that focus on fashion and retail. We are proposing to raise Rs 750 crore through private equity funding for these two companies, Biyani said.        
	Future Group also plans to raise Rs 450-500 crore for infusion into the other subsidiaries under FMCG Ltd.        
	He, however, declined to divulge further details.        
	We are looking to raise Rs 367 crore through preferential allotment of shares to the promoters in the parent company, Biyani said.         
	The shares will be allotted at Thursdays closing price of Rs 183. The Pantaloon share today ended at Rs 184.70, which is 8.04 per cent higher than Thursdays close on the BSE.

	Mumbai, Jan. 20: Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) has entered into a technology partnership with Italian superbike maker Ducati.         
	TCS will initially implement enterprise resource planning for Ducati and its subsidiaries in Europe.         
	Indias largest software exporter will look to drive major improvements in supply chain management at Ducati, particularly in the areas of forecasts and inventory levels.         
	The Tata group company did not disclose the exact size of the deal or the number of years it would serve Ducati. It said the deal was a multi-million dollar and multi-year agreement.         
	With TCS as its technology partner, Ducatis ability to respond to customers and react to the evolving business environment will increase, TCS chief S. Ramadorai said.         
	According to Ducati CEO and president Gabriele Del Torchio, the partnership would help Ducati improve its efficiency. He said that the Italian firm was not only seeking to cut costs but also looking forward to better utilise assets from its partnership with TCS.         
	We believe TCS is the right partner to help us set up a strong company platform that will help us reach the next level in terms of company competitiveness and results in todays global market, Torchio said.         
	Ducati is not the only Italian auto maker with whom TCS has a partnership. In 2007, it entered into an agreement with Ferrari to provide software to the Italian auto makers Formula One cars.         
	The Italian firm is likely to open its first India showroom in Mumbai early this summer.

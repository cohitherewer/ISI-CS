The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | NTPC wants govt to ensure gas supply
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      NTPC wants govt to ensure gas supply
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Sharma: Clearing matters                                  
	New Delhi, Nov. 23: The empowered group of ministers should specifically direct Reliance Industries to supply gas from its Krishna-Godavari fields to NTPCs Kawas and Gandhar plants over the initially committed period of 17 years for an agreed on price of $2.34 per mBtu, the power PSU has said.         
	In a letter to power secretary H.S. Brahma, NTPC chairman R.S. Sharma said, The power ministry may please request the eGoM (on gas allocation) for necessary direction for supply of gas to NTPCs (Kawas and Gandhar) expansion projects at the price and terms of the contract with RIL without prejudice to NTPCs rights and contentions in the NTPC vs RIL suit.        
	Earlier, NTPC had written to the government for the allocation of 12 million standard cubic metres of gas a day (mmscmd) for $2.34 per million British thermal unit (mBtu), till the court decides on the case with Mukesh Ambanis Reliance Industries Limited (RIL). NTPC decided to seek the direction in the wake of the Reliance counsel telling the Supreme Court in a case with RNRL that Reliance could supply gas from the Krishna-Godavari basin for 11 years and not 17.        
	This has serious implications on the supply of gas to NTPC according to the bid submitted by RIL and will go against the state-owned power producers interest, Sharma stated in the letter to Brahma.        
	The eGoM had earlier fixed a price of $4.2 per unit, without prejudice to NTPCs case for a lower price. The price of $4.2 is also being contested, currently, by Anil Ambanis Reliance Natural Resources Limited (RNRL) and RIL at the Supreme Court.        
	RIL has said the pact with NTPC offering the low price had not been signed but merely negotiated.        
	Sharma urged the government to protect NTPCs interest at this stage itself and give necessary directions to RIL under production sharing contract to supply 12 mmscmd of gas for a period of 17 years for the expansion projects at the terms and price of NTPC suit contract with RIL.        
	NTPC is pursuing a case before Bombay High Court against RIL over a December 2005 contract on gas supply from Krishna-Godavari.         
	RIL had offered to supply 12mmscmd to Kawas and Gandhar at $2.34 per mBtu for 17 years. Later, RIL said it could not supply the gas at the price.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                                  
	Mumbai, Oct. 14: The sensex surged to a 17-month high today with the market buoyed by signals that the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) could hold off on plans to tighten its monetary policy when it meets on October 27.        
	Two key figures  Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and his top economic policy advisor C. Rangarajan  have said this week that the Centre will not roll back its economic stimulus measures.         
	Planning Commission deputy chairman Montek Singh Ahluwalia had chimed in to say the stimulus measures would stay till the government was confident that it would achieve a growth rate of 7 per cent this year.        
	The talk provided the ballast to stocks that have already been rising on a stream of robust corporate results for the quarter ended September 30.        
	The sensex closed at 17231.11, up 204.44 points or 1.2 per cent  the highest level since May 21 last year. The bellwether index had touched an intra-day high of 17274.59.        
	Global stock markets have also been buoyant rising to a 12-month high with the MSCI all-country index climbing to 294.41, a level last seen in early October 2008.        
	Brokers in Mumbai said the market was also gung ho over the robust 10.4 per cent year-on-year growth in industrial output in August. This has sparked optimism that the domestic economy is well on its way to recovery.        
	The Nifty of the National Stock Exchange climbed to 5118.20, a rise of 63.95 points or 1.27 per cent over its previous close.        
	An analyst said investors were also encouraged by strong trade data announced by China recently which indicated that the global economy was showing signs of improvement.         
	The European markets also opened on a positive note because of a jump in US stock index futures.         
	Later, the US markets opened on a good note with both the Nasdaq and the Dow Jones hitting their 2009 intra-day highs.        
	Metal counters surged on news that prices were firming up on the London Metal Exchange.         
	Auto stocks zipped on the back of strong sales in September and the prospect of good buying interest during the festival season.        
	The BSE metal index surged 780.29 points, or 5.27 per cent, while the BSE capital goods index gained 329.26 points, or 2.38 per cent. The BSE auto index was up 149.13 points or 2.28 per cent.        
	Of the 25 sensex stocks that rose today, Mahindra amp; Mahindra spurted 6.12 per cent, Sterlite Industries by 5.38 per cent, Hindalco by 5.04 per cent, Tata Steel by 4.69 per cent, the State Bank of India by 4.46 per cent and Tata Motors by 4.07 per cent.        
	Analysts, however, urged investors to remain cautious while taking positions, particularly in large cap counters as they have gained significantly in recent times.        
	A correction is on the cards shortly. However, those who want to enter at the current levels can look at mid-cap counters as valuations of many stocks there are at attractive levels, said an analyst who did not wish to be identified.        
	Meanwhile, the rupee rose to a high of 46.13 against the dollar, which plummeted to a new low against its major rivals, on anticipation of foreign funds shovelling cash into strong domestic equity markets.        
	In brisk trading at the Interbank Foreign Exchange market, the domestic currency hit a high of 46.02, a level not seen since September 24, 2008.         
	However, it came down to settle at 46.13, up 35 paise from its previous close.        
	Foreign exchange dealers said weak dollar overseas compelled exporters and corporate houses to sell the US currency, anticipating further fall in the American unit.        
	Dollar fell to a 14-month low against the euro on declining confidence in the US economic recovery.

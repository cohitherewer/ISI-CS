The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | SAIL awaits sops from Bengal
                                                                                                               SAIL awaits sops from Bengal
          JAYANTA ROY CHOWDHURY                          Roongta: Long wait                                  
	New Delhi/Burnpur, Sept. 2: Steel Authority of India Ltd (SAIL) feels the capacity of the Rs 14,440-crore under-construction IISCO steel plant can be jacked up to 5 million tonnes from the proposed 2.9 mt if the Bengal government provides the promised tax concessions.         
	Two years back, when the IISCO modernisation was approved, Bengal had assured the SAIL subsidiary of tax sops. However, the concessions have not been notified by the state as yet.        
	Steel ministry officials are unhappy with the state governments tardiness in implementing the promised sales tax and VAT deferrals for 5 years from April 1, 2008.         
	IISCO could in time be developed into a 5mt steel plant. We have scope for such developments in the future, said SAIL chief S.K. Roongta.         
	The Rs 44,000-crore steel giant wants to attain a capacity of 26mt by 2012 and is looking at Bengal for major expansion.         
	Udyog Bhawan, home to the steel ministry, has been insisting that SAIL pursue the Bengal governments promised tax benefits.        
	Last year, Nilotpal Roy, then IISCO managing director, had written a letter to West Bengal industry minister Nirupam Sen seeking waiver of sales tax, exemption from payment of electricity duty, royalty, cess for a period of 5 years from April 1, 2008.         
	An almost identical letter had been sent by his successor S.P. Rao on August 3 this year seeking the same concessions. However, no answers have come from the state.         
	Steel ministry officials say Adhunik, JSW and other steel makers who have just signed memorandums of understanding with Bengal have already been given similar sops.         
	Its just PSUs who get left out. Here we are reviving an ailing pride of Bengal by building a brand new plant on which work is going on in full swing and we get no support from the state government. Private players on the other hand seem to get all concessions they seek, top officials said.         
	SAIL is building Indias single largest blast furnace at IISCO, Burnpur, with capacity to melt up to 2.9 mt of steel.         
	The technology comes from SAILs Korean rival Posco. Larsen amp; Toubro is the main civil contractor, while the designs of the facilities are by Italys Danieli.         
	Officials said that SAIL might be the only major investor in metals in Bengal for the next few years, with plans to spend more than Rs 18,000 crore.         
	Elaborate plans drawn up by private entities such as Jindal Steel, Bhushan Steel and Videocon to invest nearly Rs 100,000 crore have remained only on paper.         
	Smaller plants making construction bars have been the only real investment in metals.         
	In addition to IISCO, the PSU will invest Rs 3,500 crore in Durgapur Steel Plant, Alloy Steels Plant and metal works facilities at Kulti.         
	Bengal is a favoured destination in steel because of abundant availability of coal, good rail and road linkages with the rest of the country and the Haldia port. The iron ore mines in Orissa and Jharkhand are also nearby.         
	However, the slowdown has forced most major steel makers to put on hold their expansion plans.         
	Besides, steel makers such as ArcelorMittal and Posco are facing long delays in Orissa and Jharkhand because of red tape.

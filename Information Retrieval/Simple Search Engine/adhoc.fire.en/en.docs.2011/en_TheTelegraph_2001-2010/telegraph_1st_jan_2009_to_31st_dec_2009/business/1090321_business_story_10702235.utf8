	Calcutta, March 20: Adani Wilmar, a leader in the domestic edible oil market, is eyeing acquisitions in south and central India to more than double its capacity to 2.5 million tonnes in three years.        
	We will achieve this (2.5mt by 2012) both by way of expansion and acquisition, Atul Chaturvedi, CEO of Adani Wilmar, said.        
	The company hopes to take advantage of the falling acquisition cost because of the economic downturn.        
	Asset prices have significantly come down to realistic levels in the past six months. If there is opportunity, we will go for it. Finance is not a problem for us, Chaturvedi said.        
	The Rs 6,000-crore Adani Wilmar is a 50:50 joint venture between the $5-billion Adani Enterprises of Gujarat and $16.5-billion Wilmar of Singapore.        
	The company has expanded capacity at all its factories, both crushing and refining, including Haldia. The capacity is being doubled to 1,600 tonnes per day in Haldia at an investment of Rs 100 crore.         
	The company has also expanded capacity at its Mundra plant in Gujarat.         
	It has also acquired plants in Madhya Pradesh and Maharashtra.        
	Chaturvedi said the cost of raising capacity had also come down during the last six months as steel and cement had become cheaper.        
	The acquisition cost must be lower than building a new one. Otherwise, why should one go for it, he said.        
	The edible oil industry in India is estimated at 13 million tonnes. However, only 20 per cent of it is branded.        
	Around 55 per cent of the market comprises refined oil, where Adani Wilmar is the leader.         
	It enjoys a 19 per cent share in the 7.15mt market with brands such as Fortune, Kings and Raag soya, sunflower and mustard oil.         
	The edible oil market is growing by 6 per cent in India. In Bengal, growth is about 20 per cent.

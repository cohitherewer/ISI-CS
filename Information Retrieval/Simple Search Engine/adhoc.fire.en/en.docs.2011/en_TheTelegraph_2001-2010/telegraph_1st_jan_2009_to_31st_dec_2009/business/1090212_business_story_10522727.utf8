          OUR BUREAU                                            
	Calcutta, Feb. 11: Sanjay Kumar Bajoria is staking a claim to Rs 150 crore of the late jute baron Arun Bajorias Rs 3,000-crore estate.        
	Arun Bajoria died in March last year.        
	Sanjay, Arun Bajorias younger cousin, is staking his claim on the strength of two handwritten notes, which have been challenged by the heirs to the Bajoria estate.         
	According to a document available with The Telegraph, Sanjay has submitted copies of the two notes he claims were written by Arun Bajoria along with a petition to Calcutta High Court. He has argued that the two notes testify to a valid agreement between the cousins.        
	Under Annexure A of the petition filed by Sanjay, there are the notes dated November 11, 2004 and July 29, 2006. Theygive details of Sanjays holding in Arun Bajorias companies and assets.        
	On September 25, Sanjay had filed a suit before Calcutta High Court claiming that he was the 15 per cent owner of certain assets or properties of Arun Bajoria and his companies.         
	He said the two cousins had worked as joint venture partners since 1999 till Arun Bajorias death in March. These assets are now worth about Rs 1,000 crore.         
	Sanjay has asked for a 15 per cent stake in Aruna Jute Mill, East Coast Jute Mill, Bobbili Jute Mill, Mangalpur Jute Mill, Hukumchand New Expansion Mills and properties associated with these mills.         
	He has also staked a claim to real estate projects at Garden Reach, CR Avenue, Kona, Behala and Sooterkin Street. The project on CR Avenue is the E-Mall (formerly Magnet House).        
	Arun Bajoria is survived by wife Lata and four daughters. Except for the youngest daughter Surbhi, the other three  Pooja Jalan, Meenakshi Jatia and Nidhi Bhwalka  are married.        
	The Bajoria empire includes 11 jute mills, over 50 real estate assets spread across India and strategic investments in different companies through group investment arm Mega Resources. Hooghly Mills Company is the holding firm of the jute mills in the group.        
	Immediately after filing the suit last year, Sanjay Bajoria had sought permission to withdraw the suit and expressed his desire to file a fresh suit.         
	Justice N. Patherya had allowed the prayer and Sanjays lawyers had filed a fresh suit.        
	Challenging Justice Patheryas decision, Lata Bajoria moved a petition that came up for hearing today.         
	Her lawyers said, the trial courts decision was bad in law. The case, based on the first suit, should be declared maintainable.        
	After hearing both sides, the division bench reserved its judgment.

	We are ready to roll, J. Gordon Beckham Jr, president and CEO of McCamish Systems, said in a statement.        
	The deal is expected to be completed by this year and revenues will start flowing from January.        
	McCamishs 260 staff will become part of Infosys BPO. The offerings of Infosys BPO include finance and accounting, human resource and legal services outsourcing.         
	HP acquisition

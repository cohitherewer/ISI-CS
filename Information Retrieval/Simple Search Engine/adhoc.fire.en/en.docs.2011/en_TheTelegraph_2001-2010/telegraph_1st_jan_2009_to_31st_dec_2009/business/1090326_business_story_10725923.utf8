	The PSU insurance firm, which unveiled a new logo today, said the revamped structure would reduce the settlement period of claims to seven days by 2010 from 18-20 days now. Grey Worldwide will plan the makeover.        
	The company now operates at four levels  branch, divisional, regional and head offices.

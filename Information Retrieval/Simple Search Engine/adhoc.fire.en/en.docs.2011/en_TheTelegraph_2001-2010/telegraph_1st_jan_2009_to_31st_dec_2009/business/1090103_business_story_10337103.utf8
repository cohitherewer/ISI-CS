The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Industry sulks at growth recipe   Package focus on auto firms, core sector
                                                                                                               Industry sulks at growth recipe
   Package focus on auto firms, core sector
          OUR BUREAU                                                
	New Delhi, Jan. 2: The government today announced its second stimulus package to rekindle growth in a stuttering economy but the measures failed to evoke a ripple of enthusiasm in industry.        
	The new package  which had been eagerly anticipated and came less than a month after the first set of measures were unveiled  sought to funnel more funds into infrastructure projects, crank up demand in the battered automobile sector, and permit cash-strapped states to raise market loans of up to Rs 30,000 crore.        
	However, there were groans of disappointment from industry where there was a pall of gloom after industrial output fell to 0.4 per cent in October.        
	The automobile industry felt the government hadnt done enough to reverse a dramatic slump in sales this year.        
	The government needs to take many more measures to substantially stoke demand as that has gone into a reverse gear, said Tata Motors MD Ravi Kant. Sales in the commercial vehicles segment are down almost 70 per cent, forcing auto makers to shut down plants for several days to lower inventories.        
	There was little likelihood of more stimulus measures until at least June when a new government was expected to be formed after the general elections. There will be no further stimulus packages in the rest of this fiscal year. We see no reason for it and, in any case, we will need parliamentary approval, said Montek Singh Ahluwalia, deputy chairman of the Planning Commission who unveiled the measures at a crowded press conference in Delhi.        
	Exporters saw little in the package except for a rollback in the rates under the duty entitlement passbook scheme (DEPB) to levels that prevailed before November when they had been trimmed. The scheme was also extended till December 31.        
	We find no serious consideration except the extension of the DEPB scheme, said A. Sakthivel, president of the Federation of Indian Export Organisation. Exports slumped for a second straight month in November as the global recession sapped demand for Indian products. Overseas shipments dropped 9.9 per cent to $11.5 billion from a year earlier after contracting 12.1 per cent in October, the first slump in seven years. Exporters were looking for stimulus measures to counter the slump.        
	The government relaxed the rules for external commercial borrowings by removing the all-in-cost ceiling on such loans. Until now, companies could raise three-to-five year ECB loans at an interest rate of 300 basis points above Libor. The limit was 500 basis points above Libor for loans with a tenure of over five years. It also allowed realty companies to use ECBs to develop integrated townships.        
	The package has also given a boost to the corporate bond market by raising the FII investment limit from $6 billion to $15 billion.        
	The government will also form a special purpose vehicle to aid liquidity against investment grade papers for non-banking finance companies. The SPV can provide liquidity of up to Rs 25,000 crore.         
	State-owned banks will get Rs 20,000 crore in recapitalisation funds over the next two years which will improve their capital adequacy levels, Ahluwalia said. Finance secretary Arun Ramanathan said the two stimulus packages would result in a revenue loss of Rs 40,000 crore in 2008-09.                           
	The fiscal deficit would rise to 6 per cent of gross domestic product from a budgeted level of 2.5 per cent, Ahluwalia said.

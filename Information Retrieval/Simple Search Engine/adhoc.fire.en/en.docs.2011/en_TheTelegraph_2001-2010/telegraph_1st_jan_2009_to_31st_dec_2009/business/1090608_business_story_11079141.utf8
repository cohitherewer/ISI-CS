The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Gain from the swing
                                                                                                               Gain from the swing
        Book profit when it looks good, dont panic when it gets tough. Srikumar Bondyopadhyay has tips for the equity investor                                            
	The 30-share BSE sensex started year 2006 at 9422.49 points and steadily climbed to 21206.77 points through the next two years. It was a fairly smooth ride and equity investors saw the value of their investments grow manifold in a short span of time.        
	The Midas touch was so mesmerising that small investors could not even think of selling at least a part of their portfolios and book profits.         
	What followed was stock markets worst nightmare. From the dizzy heights of over 21000 points in January 2008, the sensex plunged to 7696.39 points in the next eight months, resulting in huge investment losses for a wide spectrum of investors  retail, high-net worth individuals and domestic and foreign institutions.         
	The fall in the sensex value, however, didnt capture the broader picture  a greater loss in broader market indices, in the shares of small- and mid-cap companies.         
	Seeing their gains of three years from 2005 drown in just eight months, many small investors liquidated their holdings and switched to safe haven bank fixed deposits offering a lucrative 10.50 per cent interest. Those who stayed put in the hope of a better time in future stopped short of investing any more at these low levels.         
	Small investors lose        
	The result is: Small investors were left out when the market moved up to 15103.55 points from 7697.39 in the last eight months.         
	Small investors could hardly take advantage of the swing in the markets because of their herd mentality  they trooped in when share prices had already made hefty gains and rushed out when prices plunged.        
	Now, imagine this. You would not have suffered losses when share prices crashed in January last year had you booked profits from your equity investments at regular intervals.         
	Having booked profits when markets were moving up, you could have used that capital gain in buying good shares at market lows and made further profits when share prices surged again.        
	Its easier said than done if you are not a whole-time investor who keeps track of share price movements and acts swiftly to price fluctuations.         
	A solution        
	Crisis is the mother of invention, they say. And thanks to what happened in the stock markets over the last 16 months, mutual funds are now introducing equity schemes that promise to solve this problem for small investors.         
	Some new schemes provide for partial profit booking automatically whenever the net asset value (per unit) of the scheme or its benchmark index reaches a pre-set limit.         
	Individual investors thus dont have to bother about tracking his/her investment value and share price movements and rush to a fund house or brokerage to redeem investments whenever its value reaches a desired level. The redemption and partial profit booking is done automatically by the in-built system of these schemes.        
	ICICI Prudential Mutual Fund was the first fund house to launch such a scheme  the Target Returns Fund.         
	New fund        
	Now, Reliance Mutual Fund, the countrys largest asset management company, has filed a prospectus with the market regulator for a similar product called Target Appreciation Fund. The company filed this product for approval last month.        
	ICICI Prudential Target Returns Fund NFO, which opened on April 15 and closed on May 14 this year, mobilised Rs 800 crore. This reflects investors interest in the fund, given the fact that each of the three to four equity-linked saving schemes (ELSS) launched since December last year could collect only a few crore of rupees and there were few diversified equity schemes since October last year.        
	The basic difference between the yet-to-be launched Target Appreciation Fund from Reliance Mutual Fund and ICICI MFs Target Return Fund is that while the latter has pre-set target returns pegged to the net asset value (per unit) of the scheme, the former pegs the pre-set appreciation rates to the sensex.         
	In Reliance MFs fund, the average closing value of the sensex during the 45 days before the allocation of units will be considered as the base value of the index for calculating the pre-set appreciation levels at 20 per cent, 40 per cent, 60 per cent, 80 per cent and 100 per cent. Whenever the closing value of the sensex appreciates from the base level to the predefined levels, the fund will automatically and compulsorily redeem a part of units outstanding in an individual investors account.         
	Unit holders in the Reliance MFs scheme will get back their redemption value. In the ICICI scheme, investors will have to choose from four predefined debt schemes of the fund house to reinvest the redeemed amount.         
	Both the schemes envisage investing in shares of top 100 companies in terms of market capitalisation.        
	However, in the Reliance MF scheme, the NAV appreciation at the time of redemption may not match the target appreciation rates.         
	When the sensex appreciates by 20 per cent from the base value, the first trigger will be activated and 25 per cent of the units outstanding in an investors account will be automatically redeemed. But the NAV at which the units will be redeemed may not appreciate by 20 per cent. It may be more or less or equal to 20 per cent.        
	In case of the ICICI MFs scheme, the redemption of units will take place at the specified trigger levels of 12 per cent, 20 per cent, 50 per cent and 100 per cent.        
	However, in both the schemes a trigger once activated, immediately becomes inactive. That is, if markets happen to fall immediately and rise again, the said trigger will not be activated once more.         
	Both the schemes thus ensure that investors dont miss out on profit booking when markets move up and suffer hefty capital loss during declines.

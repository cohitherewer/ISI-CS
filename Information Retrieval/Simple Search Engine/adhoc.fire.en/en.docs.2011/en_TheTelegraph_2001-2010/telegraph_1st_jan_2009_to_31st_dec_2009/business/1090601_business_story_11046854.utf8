The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | GM bankruptcy countdown begins
                                                                                                               GM bankruptcy countdown begins
                              Changing track                            
	Washington, May 31 (Reuters): A majority of General Motors bondholders have agreed to a debt-for-equity exchange, a source familiar with the voting said, helping to pave the way for a bankruptcy filing expected on Monday.        
	The bondholders completed voting on Saturday and slightly more that 50 per cent agreed to the swap that would give them up to 25 per cent ownership of a reorganised GM in exchange for $27 billion in debt, the source said.        
	A bankruptcy filing by GM would rank as the third-largest bankruptcy in the US history and the largest and most complex manufacturing bankruptcy ever.        
	GM has been losing market share since the early 1980s when it commanded 45 per cent of the US market. It has been hurt by its reliance on a truck-dominated vehicle line-up and by a deep plunge in demand as credit tightened in 2008.        
	Since last week, GM has been racing to complete a series of last-minute deals intended to help speed its way through a fast-track bankruptcy that would see it emerge under the majority ownership of the US government.        
	Those deals have included a new contract for the United Auto Workers union and an agreement to spare GMs Opel brand from collapse in a deal brokered by the German government.        
	Bondholders have been one of the last pieces to fall into GMs complicated bankruptcy puzzle under the direction of the autos task force appointed by the White House and headed by former investment banker Steve Rattner.        
	In late March, the Obama administration put the automaker on a 60-day notice to restructure and clinch concessionary deals with its union and bondholders.        
	The US government has already pumped $19.4 billion in emergency funds into the Detroit-based automaker since the start of the year.         
	Opel stirs turmoil        
	The Italian government is under fire from unions and opposition politicians for failing to back car maker Fiat and persuade Germany that it would be the best partner for Opel, the European arm of General Motors.         
	Germany on Saturday sealed a deal with Canadian auto parts group Magna, GM and the US government to save Opel from the imminent bankruptcy of its US parent.        
	Magna has Russian backing for its bid.        
	The Italian government was the least in evidence, Guglielmo Epifani, head of the CGIL union, told La Repubblica newspaper in an interview published on Sunday.        
	Thats a really bad thing, he said. It was politics which decided in (US car capital) Detroit and it was politics that decided in Berlin, he said.

	New Delhi, Sept. 11: Industrial production increased for the fourth consecutive month this fiscal, fuelling hopes of an economic rebound.         
	Factory output for July rose 6.8 per cent on strong consumer demand, which analysts feel will further rise during the festival season. A late revival in monsoon and a slew of social schemes will temper any fall in rural incomes because of a drought-like situation in many parts of the country.         
	It (industrial production growth rate) is picking up. I hope it will continue, finance minister Pranab Mukherjee said. The minister said the signs of improvement were visible in key sectors such as cement, steel, consumer goods and housing.         
	There is a possibility (sustaining an upswing in industrial growth) but that possibility is not adequate to compensate for a shortfall in exports. Unless demand in the industrial world improves, exports wont pick up, Mukherjee said.        
	Industrial output data show underlying signs of recovery in activity and the index is likely to continue its uptrend as global demand gradually picks up, said Sonal Varma, an economist with Nomura.         
	A series of interest rate cuts and stimulus measures have helped to boost demand at home and limit the damage to manufacturing from the slump in exports. Consumer goods are likely to do well in the festival season, especially following the governments decision to release the remaining arrears of its staff, under the recommendations of the Sixth Pay Commission.         
	Manufacturing production rose 6.8 per cent in July against 6.9 per cent a year ago. Electricity grew 4.2 per cent against 4.5 per cent a year ago, while mining growth was up to 9.9 per cent against a mere 2.8 per cent. Consumer durables, which had been contracting, expanded 19.8 per cent in July, while consumer non-durables grew 5 per cent.

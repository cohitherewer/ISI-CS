The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Britannia seeks stay on eviction notice
                                                                                                               Britannia seeks stay on eviction notice
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Calcutta, Oct. 30: Britannia Industries has moved Alipore Judges Court seeking a stay order against an eviction notice served by the Calcutta Port Trust.        
	According to a court source, a hearing on the plea took place today and the copy of the judgment would be published on the next working day.        
	The matter is sub-judice and a decision is expected shortly, a spokesperson for Britannia told The Telegraph.        
	When contacted, a CPT official said the authority would follow the lawful procedure.        
	In its petition, Britannia said CPT had served the order for eviction and payment of arbitrary amount of damages without any disclosed reason, basis and necessary break up, by arbitrary exercise of power under bias, in gross violation of the statutory mandates and the principles of natural justice.        
	On October 15, the estate officer of the CPT (appointed by the central government under the Public Premises Act 1971) served the eviction notice which said, M/S. Britannia Industries of 15 Taratala Road, Calcutta  700 088 and all persons who may be in occupation of the same premises or any part thereof to vacate the same premises within 15 days of the date of publication of this order.        
	 Britannia and all other persons concerned are liable to be evicted from the premises, if need be, by the use of force.        
	The Telegraph broke the story on October 22.        
	Britannia has informed its workmen that the company was planning to relocate its sales team from 15 Taratala Road.               
	But the company did disclose any detail of the plan to its workmen.

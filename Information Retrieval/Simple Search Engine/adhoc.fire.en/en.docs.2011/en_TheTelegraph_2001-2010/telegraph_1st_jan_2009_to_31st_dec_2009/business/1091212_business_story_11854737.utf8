The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Pat amp; punch for industry growth

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                            
	New Delhi, Dec. 11: The countrys industrial production rose over 10 per cent in October, backed by stimulus measures and a robust domestic demand.        
	Output at factories, utilities and mines rose 10.3 per cent in October from a year earlier after growing at a revised rate of 9.6 per cent in September.         
	However, the figures were below Street expectations of a 13.5 per cent year-on-year growth.         
	Going by month-on-month data on absolute industry indices, the growth momentum has turned negative in October as it fell 1 per cent from a positive 0.8 per cent growth in September. While the index figure for October stood at 290.1, it was 302.8 in September and 293.7 in August.        
	The lower-than-expected IIP numbers and the negative sequential factor impacted the stock markets, robbing investors of a positive close to the week.         
	On the BSE, the sensex gave up its nearly 162-point intra-day gain. The index slipped nearly 295 points from its intra-day peak and ended at 17119.03, a drop of 70.28 points.         
	The annual figures suggest that the economy is maintaining a healthy momentum after annual GDP growth hit 7.9 per cent in the September quarter, its strongest in 18 months. The increased pace is also backed by car sales, which surged 61 per cent in November from a year earlier.        
	The sequential numbers tell a different story. The impact of drought and the Diwali holiday season appears to be significant contributors to the slowdown in momentum, said economists Tushar Poddar and Pranjul Bhandari of Goldman Sachs.        
	However, Poddar and Bhandari are hopeful that the broad uptrend in economic activity will continue despite lower third-quarter numbers.         
	Growth in the first half of this fiscal is in line with expectations. The stimulus has started showing results, finance minister Pranab Mukherjee told the Lok Sabha after the release of data on industrial production.         
	He was referring to the three doses of fiscal stimuli  worth Rs 186,000 crore  announced since last December.         
	The strong economic growth also suggests that tax stimulus may be wound up in a phased manner from the next budget. Mukherjee had said that stimulus measures would be wound up when recovery was strong.                                      
	Poddar and Bhandari expect the Reserve Bank to begin withdrawing liquidity through the cash reserve ratio of banks and to hike rates gradually, beginning with a 25 basis points policy hike in January 2010.        
	Montek Singh Ahluwalia, deputy chairman of the Planning Commission, said Octobers output growth shows the stimulus measures are taking effect and the recovery is gaining ground. I hope the double-digit growth momentum will be maintained in the coming months.        
	Citi India had forecast an annual IIP growth of 9.5 per cent. Rohini Malkani, economist at Citi India, said given the low base as growth averaged 0.8 per cent during November-March 2008, coupled with signs of demand picking up, industrial growth could come in at the 9-11 per cent range in the coming months.         
	Citi India expects that given a surprise on the agriculture front, there appears to be an upside of around 50 basis points to its full-year estimate of 6.2 per cent GDP growth.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Swing is king, turnover touches dizzy heights
                                                                                                               Swing is king, turnover touches dizzy heights
          OUR BUREAU                                            
	May 19: The stock market is making new records everyday. Total turnover today on the BSE and the NSE rose to Rs 1,57,918.77 crore, the highest ever in the history of Indian bourses, against Rs 72,813.87 crore on May 15.         
	The NSE witnessed the highest ever single-day trading volume, with the number of trades crossing the one-crore-mark. The BSE cash segment recorded a turnover of Rs 11,781.35 crore, more than double of Rs 5,140.36 crore recorded on May 15.         
	The NSE cash segment recorded a turnover of Rs 40,151.91 crore, compared with Rs 14,820.51 crore on May 15. The F amp; segment earned Rs 1,05,985.51 crore, against Rs 52,853 crore on Friday.         
	On the BSE, volatility was the buzzword. After the one-way 2111-point rally yesterday, the sensex today swung between a crest of 14930.54 and a trough of 13834.13. At the end of the day, the BSE bellwether had recorded a swing of over 1000 points.         
	Trading was choppy throughout the session as investors booked profits. Analysts said the near-term outlook was upbeat, with many players who had missed the rally waiting to join.        
	The benchmark index closed the day at 14302.03 points, its highest in more than eight months. It closed 600 points below its intra-day high but 17.82 points, or 0.12 per cent, above its close on Monday, taking gains over two days to 17.5 per cent.         
	The two-day percentage rise was the biggest since a 25.9 per cent jump in March 1992 after Manmohan Singh, who was then the finance minister, unveiled a budget that opened the economy to foreigners.        
	The State Bank of India and ONGC Ltd extended the previous days sharp gains as traders placed their bets on the Congress-led coalition selling holdings in state companies.        
	L amp;T was a major gainer, adding 8.8 per cent to Mondays 25 per cent jump, as investors expected the engineering firm to benefit from a government drive to upgrade the countrys infrastructure.        
	However, the share price of IT firms such as Infosys and Wipro, which depend on exports for more than half of their revenues, fell because a jump in the rupees value against the dollar was seen affecting their profitability.

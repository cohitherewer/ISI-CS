          OUR BUREAU                                                  
	July 23: India Inc has started sprouting the first shoots of a strong recovery with the countrys largest car maker and its No. 1 mobile service provider turning in big first-quarter profits.        
	Car maker Maruti Suzuki today reported its first net profit growth in six quarters at Rs 583.54 crore, a 25.3 per cent jump over Rs 465.85 crore in the three months ended June 30, 2008.        
	Marutis net sales leapt 34 per cent to Rs 6,340.26 crore, reflecting a 17.7 per cent increase in car sales in the first quarter. It sold 2,26,729 units in the first three months of fiscal 2010.        
	The last time that Maruti reported a year-on-year net profit growth was in the quarter ended December 2007  a sure sign that it may be sputtering to life again after the dog days of 2008.        
	Ringing in profits        
	Mobile telephony giant Bharti Airtel also rang up a 24 per cent growth in net profits at Rs 2,517 crore against Rs 2,025 crore in the year-ago period.        
	Total revenues, however, rose by a modest 17 per cent to Rs 9,942 crore after it expanded its customer base by 8.55 million  the highest-ever growth for any quarter on a net basis. The mobile phone giant had 105.2 million customers at the end of June, giving it a market share of 24 per cent.        
	Average revenue per user fell 8.8 per cent to Rs 278 from Rs 305 in the previous quarter. The average minutes of use also declined by 1.5 per cent to 478 minutes.        
	Bharti Airtels net profits were boosted by a foreign exchange gain of Rs 250 crore against a loss of Rs 168 crore a year ago.        
	Idea Cellular  the minnow among telecom players  also turned in a tidy set of numbers. The Aditya Birla group company posted a rise in profit after tax of 13 per cent in the first quarter at Rs 297.10 crore compared with Rs 263.2 crore in the year-ago period.        
	It recorded an increase of 37 per cent in consolidated sales to Rs 2,975.9 crore compared with Rs 2,178.1 crore in the corresponding period last year.         
	Both telecom companies said their revenues were impacted by the change in the call termination charges for domestic calls that had been reduced to 20 paise per minute from 30 paise earlier. The call-originating company pays the fee to the network called.        
	Idea Cellular added 4.1 million subscribers during the quarter.        
	FMCG shines        
	Cigarette-to-hotels conglomerate ITC posted a 17.4 per cent rise in net profit at Rs 879 crore even though revenues rose by just 5 per cent to Rs 4,220.4 crore.        
	The slowdown in the hotels and agro-chemicals business dampened growth in revenues. After a strong showing by the infotech giants, it is clear that companies across a wide swathe of businesses are finally starting to climb out of the rut.        
	The earnings season is certainly good. The quarterly numbers are running ahead of expectations and there are more upgrades than downgrades, said Gaurav Dua, head of research at Sharekhan.        
	Dua said the sectors that were showing robust growth included cement, private sector banks, automobile companies, auto ancillaries such as tyres and software companies.        
	The markets surged on the good news with the sensex leaping 387.92 points to close at 15231.04. While Maruti surged 6.4 per cent to Rs 1,295.55, ACC shot up 6 per cent to close at Rs 854.65. ITC also gained by a similar margin to close at Rs 229.95        
	Oil giant flounders        
	State-owned Oil and Natural Gas Corporation reported its fourth straight drop in quarterly net profits at Rs 4,848 crore, a sharp 27 per cent plunge over a year ago.        
	The oil behemoth blamed its poor show on the discounts that the government was forcing it to pay state-owned oil refiners for selling auto fuels below cost.         
	Profits would have been higher by Rs 242 crore if it didnt have to pay the discounts. It sold crude at $58.25 a barrel after paying the discounts compared with $69.13 a barrel a year ago. Net sales fell 26 per cent to Rs 14,879 crore from Rs 20,052 crore.

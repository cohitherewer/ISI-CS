The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | New suitor in Asarco fray
                                                                                                               New suitor in Asarco fray
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Close competition                                  
	Calcutta, May 27: Sterlite Industries has a new rival in its bid to acquire US copper miner Asarco LLC. Harbinger Capital Partners, a hedge fund and one of Asarcos largest bondholders, has been allowed by a US bankruptcy court to file a reorganisation plan for Asarco.        
	Sterlite, owned by NRI billionaire Anil Agarwal, has prepared a $1.7-billion plan to revive the US company, which has slipped into bankruptcy.        
	Grupo Mexico, the estranged parent of Asarco, has also filed a $1.55-billion offer in the court.        
	According to Harbingers plan, a deal for Asarco can be ready by the end of August. It has agreed to take certain liabilities relating to asbestos claims.         
	Asarco had filed for bankruptcy in 2005 amid more than $1billion in environmental damage and asbestos claims.        
	Asarco, formerly known as American Smelting and Refining Company, is an integrated copper mining, smelting and refining company with approximately 2,600 employees. It operates mines, mills and a smelter in Arizona and a smelter and refinery in Texas.        
	Sterlite had proposed to buy the company for $2.6 billion last year but walked out of the deal as copper prices tumbled because of the global recession.        
	Harbinger asked the court to terminate Asarcos exclusivity period so that various plans could compete against each other. Exclusivity gives a company the sole right to come up with a reorganisation plan.        
	Harbinger is offering much less cash than either Sterlite or Grupo, but the hedge fund claimed it had better chances of success. Harbinger said the Sterlite plan would fail to get votes from asbestos creditors who had agreed to support Grupo Mexicos plan.        
	The company claims its plan was better than Grupo Mexicos because it will allow Asarco to keep a $6.87 billion judgment against the Mexican miner that arose from a dispute over the transfer of its one-time Peruvian mining unit, Southern Copper Corp. The next hearing in the Asarco case is on June 5.                          
	Harbinger said it has support of another Asarco bondholder Citigroup Global Markets. Together they hold two-third of the bonds of Asarco.        
	The next hearing for the Asarco case has been fixed on June 5 by judge Richard Schmidt of the Southern District of Texas.

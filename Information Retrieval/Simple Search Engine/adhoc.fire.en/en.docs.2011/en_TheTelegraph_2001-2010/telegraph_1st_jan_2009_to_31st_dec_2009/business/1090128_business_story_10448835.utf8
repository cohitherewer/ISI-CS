The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Telenor scraps rights offer
                                                                                                               Telenor scraps rights offer
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Jan. 27: Telenor has scrapped its rights offer of 12 billion kroner (Rs 8,684 crore) to fund the purchase of a 60 per cent stake in Unitech Wireless.         
	The Norway-based telecom firm said it would fund the deal with more debt and cash. The company would pay no dividend for 2008 and 2009.        
	The move follows the Norwegian governments decision against subscribing to the offer. The government has a 54 per cent stake in Telenor.        
	Telenor has decided to fund its investment in Unitech Wireless in India through a combination of cash flow and issuance of additional debt. As a result of this, Telenor withdraws the previously proposed rights issue of 12 billion kroner, the company said.         
	It has also signed an 8 billion kroner (Rs 5,789 crore) three-year loan, which could be used to fund the deal.         
	In October 2008, Delhi-based realty firm Unitech had sold a 60 per cent stake in its telecom venture for Rs 6,120 crore to Telenor, the worlds seventh largest operator in terms of subscribers.         
	However, the transaction is contingent on Unitech entering a tower-sharing deal.         
	The investments in India still depend on getting in place a deal to lease mobile towers, a spokesperson for Telenor said.

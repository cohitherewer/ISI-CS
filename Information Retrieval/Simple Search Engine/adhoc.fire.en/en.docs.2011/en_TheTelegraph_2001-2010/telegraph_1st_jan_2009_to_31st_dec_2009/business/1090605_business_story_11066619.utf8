	New Delhi, June 4: Divestment is back on the governments agenda.        
	Five years after the Manmohan Singh-led UPA government was forced to scrap a ministry for disinvestment that existed during the Vajpayee regime, President Pratibha Devisingh Patil indicated that the new government  free from the Left pressure  would sell its stake in state-owned companies.         
	But the government would ensure that its holding in these did not drop below a 51 per cent threshold.        
	In the interim budget presented in February, stand-in finance minister Pranab Mukherjee had said the UPA government expected to generate Rs 1,120 crore in 2009-10 from stake sale in RITES, Cochin Ship Yard, Telecommunications Consultants India, Manganese Ore India Ltd, Rashtriya Ispat Nigam and Satluj Jal Vidyut Nigam.         
	That is still a far cry from the Rs 14,500 crore that the Vajpayee government had earned from the selloff programme in 2003-04.        
	Faced with opposition from allies and supporting parties such as the Communists, the UPA government, in its first term, could raise only Rs 8,500 crore through a selective stake sale. In comparison, the BJP-led NDA government had raised Rs 28,000 crore during its five-year term.        
	However, a finance ministry official recently said the government aimed to sell 10-15 per cent in each of the 18 state-run companies to help bridge the yawning fiscal deficit.        
	Patils speech also put the focus back on financial reforms. She said the government planned to relax rules relating to foreign investment and hinted at the possibility of rule changes in the insurance and pension sectors.

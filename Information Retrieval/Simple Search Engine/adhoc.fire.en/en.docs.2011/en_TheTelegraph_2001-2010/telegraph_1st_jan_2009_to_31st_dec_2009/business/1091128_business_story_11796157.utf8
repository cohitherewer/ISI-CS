          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Chawla: Mood intact                                        
	New Delhi, Nov. 27: Policy-makers do not see the Dubai crisis leading to a drop in remittances and job cuts among Indians working there.        
	The Dubai crisis is unlikely to impact employment, salaries and remittances of Indian expatriates staying in the emirates, said Ashok Chawla, finance secretary.        
	The Reserve Bank of India has said it will ask banks to disclose their exposure to Dubai World  the state-owned entity that is at the centre of the debt crisis in Dubai. We will ask the banks to furnish the details soon, RBI deputy governor Shyamala Gopinath said in Ahmedabad today.        
	The RBI may come out with a statement after the banks furnish the requisite information.        
	In Dubai, goods from other countries are in transit for re-export. Manufacturers in the region are processing and packaging units who work on the goods in transit. Unless, there is a drop in the demand for the goods meant for re-export, which, so far, is not the case, industry in Dubai is safe.        
	Remittances did not suffer even during the height of the larger global crisis (during 2008), Chawla said.         
	Chawla and other officials of the finance ministry, however, admitted that the government was yet to study the issue fully and its implications on the economy and companies. We will have to study what the issue is, what the problem is, and what will be the possible implication, if any, for the Indian economy, people and firms.         
	Bankers and analysts said Indian banks had little exposure to Dubai-based entities. The four major banks that operate in the region  the State Bank of India, ICICI Bank, HDFC Bank and Federal Bank  focus mainly on inward remittances from lowly-paid construction workers in the emirates. Indians account for about 40 per cent of the population in the United Arab Emirates (UAE).        
	I have requested our officers to study this. If necessary, we will certainly communicate to the public what the implications might be, RBI governor Duvvuri Subbarao said at a function in Hyderabad.        
	News of the crisis in Dubai led analysts to examine its impact on domestic banks that had been expanding their overseas operations.        
	Officials from leading private sector banks such as ICICI Bank and Axis Bank said they did not have material exposure to Dubai.        
	However, sources at Bank of Baroda (BoB) said the nationalised bank had a fair bit of exposure to West Asia, including Dubai. It had exposures not only to real estate but also retailers and other companies.        
	During the first half of this fiscal, the UAE, which comprises seven emirates, including Dubai, has dislodged the US to become the largest destination for Indian goods. Its share is 13.1 per cent against Americas 11.4 per cent.         
	Most of the goods are for re-export to West Asia, central Asia, Africa and Pakistan.

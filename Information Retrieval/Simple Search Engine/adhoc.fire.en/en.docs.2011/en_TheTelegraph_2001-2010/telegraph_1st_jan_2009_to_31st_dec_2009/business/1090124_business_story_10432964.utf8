	New Delhi, Jan. 23: General Motors India plans to roll out more cars powered by alternative fuels such as compressed natural gas and LPG.        
	Our strategy is to have high fuel efficiency in all our vehicles in the first place. Then we will be introducing vehicles powered by fuels such as CNG and LPG, besides having different power trains and different displacements, said Karl Slym, president of the company.        
	It plans to launch an LPG-run car in the first half of this year. At present, GM offers a CNG variant of its sedan Optra.         
	According to company officials, it is looking at introducing a similar variant for its entry level sedan Aveo.        
	GM today launched the automatic transmission four-wheel drive version of its popular SUV Captiva, priced at Rs 20.3 lakh.        
	On the companys sales target, Slym said, As far as the Captiva is concerned, we exceeded our target by almost three times last year. Overall sales for the company this year should be better than last year but it is difficult to project a figure now considering the market conditions.        
	Last year, GM sold around 2,500 Captivas out of its total sales of 65,000 vehicles in India.

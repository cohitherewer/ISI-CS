The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | IDBI to set up shop abroad
                                                                                                               IDBI to set up shop abroad
                            
	Mumbai, April 12 (PTI): Public sector IDBI Bank today said it would set up operations in Dubai, Singapore and Beijing to establish its presence abroad and help Indian corporates raise funds overseas .        
	We will be opening one branch each in Dubai and Singapore. We also plan to start a representative office in Beijing, IDBI Bank chairman and managing director Yogesh Agarwal said.        
	IDBI has 509 branches and 900 ATMs in India.         
	The bank has also bagged necessary approvals from the Reserve Bank of India to open 200 additional branches during the current fiscal.         
	The bank, however, has no overseas presence, so far.         
	Apart from catering to the Indian corporates for raising funds overseas, the trigger to start operations abroad is to establish our foreign presence, an area which we neglected, he said.        
	Agarwal said the bank hoped to receive approvals from the local governments in the next one to two months and start operations immediately.         
	We have the Reserve Bank of Indias permission to start operations in these geographies for over one year now, Agarwal said, adding that getting the paper works ready and necessary approvals were coming in the way.         
	Public sector lenders such as the State Bank of India and the Bank of Baroda have sizeable presence overseas through their branches and representative offices.         
	Among private sector banks, ICICI Bank is the leader in the area .        
	Analysts believe that since Indian banks are less affected by the global financial crisis, they are in a better position compared with their international peers to go global and even acquire banks abroad.        
	Agarwal, however, said that IDBI Bank was not looking at acquisitions abroad.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Construction held pride of place in Rajus plans
                                                                                                               Construction held pride of place in Rajus plans
          G. RADHAKRISHNA                              
	Hyderabad, Feb. 15 : B. Ramalinga Raju today confessed to sleuths that his main line of business was construction.        
	My core business has always been construction. Thats why I launched Maytas and was confident that the asset accumulation through it would have resolved all the crisis in Satyam, Raju, whos the founder of Satyam Computer, told officers of the Serious Frauds Investigation Office. Raju told the officers that he had been working on the construction projects of Maytas so that they would be big assets for Satyam. I am sad that it did not work out and I threw Satyam into a major crisis.        
	On December 16, Raju had proposed the merger of Maytas Properties and Maytas Infra  companies owned by his family  with Satyam, which he had to abort almost immediately following vociferous protests by the software firms shareholders. Weeks later, he admitted to a Rs 7,100-crore fraud in Satyam Computers. Investigators are now probing whether cash from Satyam was funnelled into other Raju group companies.         
	Vadlamani Srinivas, the former CFO of Satyam, told the investigators that he had no say as the fudging and falsifications were done at the behest of the chairman of the company (Raju).         
	He said he had tried to raise it through other channels and also informed some of the directors and senior colleagues of the company . They also expressed helplessness. Many top bosses, Srinivas said, had sold shares before the crisis broke out because they knew the company was on the brink.         
	The fate of the company was common knowledge and all the heads of department knew it and made good their anticipated losses by dumping their stocks in time.         
	A team of 12 investigators from the special frauds office today finished recording the statements of Ramalinga Raju, his brother Rama Raju and Srinivas.        
	In addition, the sleuths grilled Pricewaterhouse auditors S.Gopalakrishna and Talluri Srinivas. The duo said they were cowed down by the Satyam management whenever they raised the issue of the fudging of books.        
	World Bank hope        
	The World Bank has said it could review the eight-year ban imposed on Satyam provided the software exporter takes corrective action, according to PTI.        
	The vendor would have to demonstrate (that) corrective action had been taken to address the original causes of the ineligibility, a World Bank official from Washington said in an email.        
	Satyam chairman Kiran Karnik today said the bidders would not get access to the restated accounts as they would not be ready at the time of bidding.

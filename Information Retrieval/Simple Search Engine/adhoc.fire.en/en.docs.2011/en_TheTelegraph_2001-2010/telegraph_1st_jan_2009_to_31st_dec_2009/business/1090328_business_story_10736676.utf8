The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Tug-of-war over rate cut
                                                                                                               Tug-of-war over rate cut
          OUR BUREAU                                               Chandrasekhar: Strict
    
	March 27: Cabinet secretary K. M. Chandrasekhar today slammed banks for failing to trim interest rates after the Reserve Bank of Indias unequivocal signal to do so even as five state-owned banks announced cuts in their prime lending rates.         
	Chandrasekhar said banks, particularly the private ones, had not cut rates to the desired extent following the easing of the monetary policy by the RBI.        
	There has been certain stickiness of interest rates, banks have not shown response as we would have liked, particularly private sector banks, he said.        
	Chandrasekhar also said that given the heavy borrowing programme of the government, there was limited scope for rate cuts.        
	Yesterday, RBI governor Duvvuri Subbarao, too, had wondered why lending rates were not coming down in response to its incentives. The Indian Banks Association, however, had ruled out rate cuts. PNB chairman K. C. Chakrabarty said there was no further scope for cuts.        
	Amid the debate, five banks today cut rates  Allahabad Bank, Uco Bank, the United Bank of India (UBI), the Oriental Bank of Commerce and Punjab amp; Sind Bank (PSB).        
	Oriental Bank, Calcutta-based Uco Bank and Delhi-based PSB said they would reduce their prime lending rates (PLR) by 50 basis points, while Allahabad Bank and UBI announced a 25-basis-point cut. The new rates are effective from April 1.        
	Oriental Bank reduced its PLR to 12 per cent from 12.5 per cent, while Allahabad Bank cut its PLR to 12.25 per cent from 12.50 per cent.        
	Further, Allahabad Bank has decided to realign interest rates on its deposits from April.         
	The PSB cut its PLR to 13.5 per cent from 14 per cent.         
	Uco chairman and managing director S. K. Goel said the bank had no immediate intention to cut deposit rates. After the cut, Ucos PLR will be 12 per cent.         
	UBI has cut its PLR to 12.25 per cent from 12.50 per cent.         
	The three stimulus packages have left little room for the government to provide more fiscal incentives.         
	However, Chandrasekhar said, There is still room for policy and procedural changes and for removal of constraints in the way of corporate sector. He was speaking at a conference organised by the CII.        
	Arvind Virmani, chief economic adviser in the finance ministry, said higher spending by the government might widen the fiscal deficit to 6.5-7 per cent of the gross domestic product in 2009-10 compared with the interim budget target of 5.5 per cent.

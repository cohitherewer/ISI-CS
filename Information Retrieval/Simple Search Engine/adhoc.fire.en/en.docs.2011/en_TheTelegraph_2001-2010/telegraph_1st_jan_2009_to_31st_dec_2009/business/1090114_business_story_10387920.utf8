  Infy cuts guidance, net up 33%          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                                  
	Mumbai, Jan. 13: Infosys Technologies Ltd today gave out mixed signals when it lowered revenue guidance for fiscal 2008-09 and yet beat market expectations with 33 per cent growth in net profit for the third quarter ended December 31, 2008.        
	The lower guidance reflected challenging conditions overseas. Infosys said for the fiscal year ending March 31, 2009, consolidated revenues were expected to be in the range of $4.67 billion and $4.71 billion. This translates into a year-on-year growth of 11.8-12.8 per cent.        
	When it declared its second quarter results, the Bangalore-based IT services company had forecast that consolidated revenues would be in the range of $4.72 billion and $4.81 billion. The increasingly uncertain business environment is the prime reason for this cut in guidance, Harit Shah, IT analyst at Angel Broking.         
	Shah said over the past two quarters, Infosys had cut its dollar guidance by 6 to 6.7 per cent and the expected growth rate has come down from 19-21 per cent year-on-year to 11.8-12.8 per cent, a cut of over 8 per cent in the growth rate at the upper end.        
	Shah said the trimmed forecast was largely on account of the cross currency movements of the US dollar against the Australian dollar, euro and pound. Angel Broking has an accumulate rating on the Infosys stock.        
	Despite a disappointment on this front, Infosys posted a net profit of Rs 1,641 crore for the quarter ended December 31, 2008, a growth of 33.3 per cent over Rs 1,231 crore in the same period last year, making it the fastest growth in six quarters. Analysts had expected the profits of Infosys to be in the region of Rs 1,500 crore. Net income of the company stood at Rs 5,786 crore, a 35.5 per cent growth over Rs 4,271 crore in the third quarter of last fiscal.        
	In a challenging environment, our focus is on creating value for clients, running an optimised business, and evolving our business model that will allow us to emerge stronger when the global economy starts recovering, CEO and managing director S. Gopalakrishnan said in Bangalore today.        
	On the BSE, the Infosys stock ended higher by 6.4 per cent at Rs 1,230.20 as investors took comfort from the fact that the company was successful in beating analysts expectations.

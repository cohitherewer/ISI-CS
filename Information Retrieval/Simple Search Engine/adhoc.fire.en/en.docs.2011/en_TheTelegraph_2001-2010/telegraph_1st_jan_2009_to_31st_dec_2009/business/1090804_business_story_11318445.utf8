	Calcutta, Aug. 3: Emami Biotechs search for land to cultivate bio-diesel-producing jatropha has ended in Ethiopia, one of the poorest countries in Africa.        
	The local company  part of Rs 2,000-crore Emami group  will get on lease over 1 lakh acres in phases to cultivate pulses, sunflower, castor, menthol, besides jatropha.        
	Aditya Agarwal, director of Emami group, said the company had received 27,500 acres,where the initial work had started. The oil produced there will be brought to Emamis Haldia refinery and processed into bio-diesel.        
	Emami is not the only company to rush to Ethiopia for land. Around 400 Indian firms have procured licences in the last three years to do business there, Gennet Zewide, the Ethiopian ambassador to India, said.

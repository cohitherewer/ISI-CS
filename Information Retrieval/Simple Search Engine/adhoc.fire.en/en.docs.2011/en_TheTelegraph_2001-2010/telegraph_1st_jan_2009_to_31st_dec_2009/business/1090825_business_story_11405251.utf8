	New Delhi, Aug. 24: Japanese car maker Toyota Kirloskar Motors today said it expected sales in India to grow three-fold in the next four years.         
	Toyota is betting big on its small car to be launched late next year or in early 2011. It is also rolling out some new models.        
	The company today launched sports utility vehicle Fortuner in India.        
	We hope that within 3-4 years, we will increase sales in India by more than three times. Our planned compact car will be a factor in the growth, said Akira Okabe, senior managing director of Toyota Motor Corporation.        
	Last year, the company sold about 51,800 units; in the first seven months of this year, sales stood at 25,910 units. Our target for this year is 52,000 units, Okabe said.        
	Senior company officials said the small car launch should also help to increase market share from the current 3 per cent to 10 per cent by 2015.        
	Okabe said India could be a hub for small cars in the future. The car will roll out from Toyotas new plant in Bangalore, which will produce 70,000 units annually. Initially, 30 per cent of the components will be sourced locally.        
	Meanwhile, Toyota will recall 690,000 units of its four models produced in China because of problems with an electric window switch, company officials said today. It will be the largest ever auto recall in China, the local media has reported.        
	GM mini car        
	General Motors will export at least 20 per cent of its mini cars in the first year of their launch, scheduled for early next year. GM plans to make 50,000 units of the mini car in India in the first year.         
	The company will also roll out the Chevrolet Cruze in October. Four more models will be launched in 2010.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Glitch hits electronic tea auction
                                                                                                               Glitch hits electronic tea auction
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Calcutta, May 19: Tea e-auction debuted in the city today, but only a limited quantity was sold through the process.        
	The electronic auction could not take place fully since there was a mismatch between the lot numbers created in the electronic process and what we do manually, Calcutta Tea Traders Associations secretary Kalyan Sundaram said.         
	The mismatch between the two catalogues created confusion among the customers.        
	The auction started at 9 am today with an intention to trade 346 lots.         
	The auction for the first customer with a smaller lot was completed successfully, but the mismatch was detected in the auction of the next 218 lots. The e-auction of tea had started in South India earlier this month.

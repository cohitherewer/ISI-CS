The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Zenotech boss fumes over Daiichi offer
                                                                                                               Zenotech boss fumes over Daiichi offer
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                            
	Mumbai, Jan. 19: The open offer made by Daiichi Sankyo to the shareholders of Zenotech Laboratories has sparked a controversy with Jayaram Chigurupati, managing director of the Hyderabad-based company, opposing the price and alleging that the Japanese firm is going back on its promise made last year.        
	At the heart of the matter is the price of Rs 113.62 per share that Daiichi announced today. Chigurupati maintained that Daiichi should have paid Rs 160 per share as this was the price it had committed to pay when it negotiated the takeover of Ranbaxy last June.         
	Ranbaxy had acquired a controlling interest in Zenotech in January last year.        
	The Zenotech MD claimed that an agreement to offer Rs 160 per share was reached in July 2008. Chigurupati is the founder of Zenotech and he and family members hold around 26 per cent in the company.        
	In October 2007, Ranbaxy had entered into a share purchase agreement with Zenotech following which it also made an open offer to its shareholders at Rs 160 apiece. Ranbaxys stake in the firm rose to 46.79 per cent.        
	However, Daiichis acquisition of Ranbaxy in October last year resulted in an indirect substantial acquisition of shares and voting rights in Zenotech. Therefore, Daiichi had to come out with an open offer under Sebi regulations. It then fixed a price of Rs 113.62 per share based on the average Zenotech share price in the past 26 weeks.        
	According to current Sebi regulations, an open offer price for indirect acquisition or control shall be determined with reference to the offer price computed based on the date of the public announcement for the parent company and the date of announcement for acquisition of shares of the target company, whichever is higher.        
	Chigurupati, who is picking up cudgels on behalf of the minority shareholders of Zenotech, is not convinced by Daiichis explanation. He has now approached the market regulator to review the issue.        
	In a statement issued today, Chigurupati said Daiichi should honour commitments made by its management and revise the open offer price to Rs 160 for Zenotech shareholders.        
	Daiichis board should know that the agreement to offer Rs 160 was reached in July 2008. As a result, two lawsuits filed by Zenotech shareholders in Andhra Pradesh High Court seeking to stay Daiichis acquisition of Ranbaxy were withdrawn, he said.

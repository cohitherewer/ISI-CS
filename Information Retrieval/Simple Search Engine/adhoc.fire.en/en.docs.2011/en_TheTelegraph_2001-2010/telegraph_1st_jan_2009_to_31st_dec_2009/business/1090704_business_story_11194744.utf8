                                                                                                               Stocks gather steam
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                               
	Mumbai, July 3: The railway budget today triggered a rally in stocks.         
	On the Bombay Stock Exchange, the sensex soared 255 points to close at 14913.05 with investors scooping up stocks during the last hour of trading.         
	Short-covering also fuelled the rise.         
	According to market observers, the better-than-expected budget bolstered investor hope of a reformist Union budget.         
	The sensex, which began lower at 14552.72 in line with the weak global markets, dipped to a low of 14499.74 in early trading.         
	However, stocks bounced back late in the afternoon, and the sensex ended at 14913.05, a gain of 254.56 points, or 1.74 per cent.         
	Brokers said investors focussed on those scrips that were expected to gain from the Union budget.         
	Hopes that finance minister Pranab Mukherjee will revise incentives for housing finance firms, led to huge buying in the HDFC scrip, which ended 7.7 per cent higher at Rs 2586.25.

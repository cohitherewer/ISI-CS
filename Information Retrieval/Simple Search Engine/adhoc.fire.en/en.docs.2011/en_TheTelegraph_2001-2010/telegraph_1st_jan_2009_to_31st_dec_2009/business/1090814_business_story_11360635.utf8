The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Tax pointers propel stocks
                                                                                                               Tax pointers propel stocks
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                            
	Mumbai, Aug. 13: The sensex surged almost 500 points on Thursday brushing aside fears of a drought and the swine flu pandemic.        
	The bellwether index drew its strength from strong global cues and a positive response to the sweeping tax reforms that the government proposed to usher in.        
	The 30-scrip index of the Bombay Stock Exchange settled at 15518.49, an increase of 498.33 points, or 3.32 per cent, over its previous close. The National Stock Exchanges Nifty also saw a big rise, closing at 4605 points, an increase of 147.5 points, or 3.31 per cent.        
	Realty, banking and metals stocks advanced sharply, while mid-cap and small-cap shares fared well. The BSE realty index was up 6.86 per cent, metals index saw an increase of 5.57 per cent and the bankex closed higher at 4.34 per cent.         
	The BSE mid-cap index surged 3.59 per cent, while the small-cap index rose 4.11 per cent today. The market saw 2,215 scrips advance and 517 decline, indicating a positive market breadth.        
	Todays surge can be attributed to a couple of factors. Global cues were strong, the London Metal Exchange bounced back and, most importantly, the markets expect the new tax code to drive consumption, said Bhavin Desai, head of retail derivatives at Motilal Oswal.        
	Desai said the sensex tumbled last week as the markets believed that consumption demand would be hit because of poor rainfall.         
	However, there is an expectation that the new tax code will increase disposable income and, therefore, drive consumption that will make up for a fall in demand.         
	This anticipated increase in demand also pushed asset-oriented realty stocks, Desai said.         
	The fact that the tax code is about two years away from being made into a law has not dampened the markets enthusiasm.

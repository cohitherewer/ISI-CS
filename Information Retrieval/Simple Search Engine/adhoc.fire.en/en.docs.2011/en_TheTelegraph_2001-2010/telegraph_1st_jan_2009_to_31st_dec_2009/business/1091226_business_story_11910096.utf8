The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | China set to beat Japan in growth race
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      China set to beat Japan in growth race
                            
	Beijing, Dec. 25 (Reuters): China has revised up its 2008 growth rate to 9.6 per cent, taking it well above the originally reported 9 per cent after calculating that the services sector has been more productive than previously thought.        
	The upward revision underscored that China was well on track to surpass Japan as the worlds second-largest economy in 2010, if not sooner, and had burnt through less energy to deliver each additional ounce of growth.        
	Chinas economy grew at 7.7 per cent in the first three quarters of 2009 compared with the same period a year ago. Peng Zhilong of the National Bureau of Statistics said the government was likely to revise up growth figures reported so far this year.        
	The hidden strength found in Chinas services sector is a modicum of good news for policymakers in China and abroad, who have said that promoting the development of the countrys non-tradeable sector is a key ingredient in rebalancing the global economy.        
	But it was still far from the mission accomplished on that front.        
	Chinas services sector accounted for 41.8 per cent of the gross domestic product last year, up from the previously reported 40.1 per cent. In developed economies, services often contribute more than 70 per cent of the GDP.        
	China always finds it hard to get accurate statistics about the services sector, and the upward revision is not a surprise, Zhang Xiaojing, a researcher with the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences (CASS), said.         
	But we cannot say Chinas economic structure is reasonable simply because of that.        
	The revisions were also unlikely to have much, if any, impact on the countrys current policy stance. The government has already begun to rein in its ultra-loose pro-growth measures adopted in the face of the global financial crisis.         
	Zhang of CASS said the overall picture of a sharp slowdown late last year and a strong recovery this year was still intact.        
	Earlier this week, Chinas central bank reaffirmed its long-standing commitment to maintain an appropriately loose monetary policy.         
	The government this week also pledged to deliver the second half of its promised two-year 4 trillion yuan ($585 billion) stimulus package in 2010.         
	Yet beneath this headline stability, Beijing has started to wind down some parts of its stimulus.

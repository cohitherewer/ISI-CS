	New Delhi, Sept. 1: Prime Minister Manmohan Singh today told many of his senior ministers not to be over-pessimistic about the drought as he and his team sat through a Planning Commission meeting that dwelt on the impact of the poor rain on the economy.        
	According to the plan panel, the farm sector will shrink 2.5 per cent this year, with foodgrain output taking a 18-million-tonne hit. The 6.1 per cent growth in the first quarter of this year wont be replicated in the next two quarters.         
	The growth rate may turn worse in the current and next quarter because of the impact of drought, Planning Commission deputy chairman Montek Singh Ahluwalia told reporters after the meeting.        
	However, Ahluwalia said growth would rebound in the fourth quarter. The plan panel said industry would grow throughout the year at 7.8 per cent and services, 8.2 per cent, bringing the annual growth rate to a respectable 6.3 per cent.         
	We project growth of 8 per cent in 2010-11 and 9 per cent in 2011-12. This is optimistic but not impossible. If we have a normal monsoon in 2010-11, we can expect a strong rebound in agriculture next year, the panel said.        
	Ahluwalia told the ministers that the September rain could make a big difference to the winter, or rabi, sowing.        
	Winter crops are more dependent on water from reservoirs, which are filling up because of the late rain.        
	Both Ahluwalia and Singh are banking heavily on the huge stocks of foodgrain that India has in its reserves on the back of two good monsoon years.         
	We are in a very strong position to manage the consequence of drought. Our food stocks, in particular, are very high, Singh said.        
	India has stocks of 50 million tonnes, enough to meet the requirements of the public distribution system for 13 months.        
	Tuesdays meeting was attended by finance minister Pranab Mukherjee, home minister P. Chidambaram, agriculture minister Sharad Pawar, power minister Sushilkumar Shinde and railway minister Mamata Banerjee, among others.        
	The drought in the current year will consume fiscal resources in an unanticipated fashion, the Planning Commission said. Managing the deficit in the current year, therefore, is likely to pose problems.        
	The government had planned to stick to its fiscal deficit target of 6.8 per cent of gross domestic product (GDP) for this fiscal and reduce the deficit to 5.5 per cent next year.         
	Ahluwalia warned that states would have to change their spending plans to remain fiscally prudent. People are not dissatisfied with the money being spent but want results from it. That is what we need to focus on.         
	His prescription for the next two years was an aggressive divestment programme which would help to cut down the fiscal gap. However, he admitted that this would have to be politically acceptable.        
	In our view, in 2010-11 and 2011-12, a bold and clear programme of divestment would help to meet some of these shortages (in resources for the plan expenditure), Ahluwalia told reporters. According to a note of the plan panel, there will be a shortage of Rs 1.6 lakh crore for plan purposes during the entire Eleventh Five Year Plan.

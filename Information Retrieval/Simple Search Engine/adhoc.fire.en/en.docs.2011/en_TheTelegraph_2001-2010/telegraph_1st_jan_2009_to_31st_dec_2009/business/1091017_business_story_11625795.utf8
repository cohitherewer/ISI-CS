	New Delhi, Oct. 16 (PTI): Additional solicitor-general Vivek Tankha is now part of the government legal team in the Ambani gas case to be heard in the Supreme Court from Tuesday.        
	Tankhas induction follows a review of the case by a panel of ministers headed by finance minister Pranab Mukherjee yesterday. The panel, comprising Mukherjee, oil minister Murli Deora and law minister Veerappa Moily, had decided to expand the legal team to put its views on the gas case.         
	Tankha will assist additional solicitor-general Mohan Parasaran who represents the government in the dispute over the quantity and price committed by Mukesh Ambani-led Reliance Industries in a 2005 family agreement for the supply of natural gas to a company run by younger brother Anil Ambani.        
	The government has filed a special leave petition in the apex court seeking to become a party to the dispute and has contended that national resources cannot be appropriated through private family arrangements.

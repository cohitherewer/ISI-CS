          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Sept. 2: The government today exempted the transport of essential goods such as foodgrains, fertilisers and petroleum products from service tax.        
	The exemptions would get retrospective effect from September 1, the day from which service tax on transport through rail and waterways was to take effect. It is necessary in the public interest to do so, the Central Board of Excise and Customs said in a notification.         
	Exempted goods include edible oilseeds and edible oil, foodgrains (cereals and pulses) and flour, petroleum and petroleum products and defence and military equipment.        
	Transport of parcels containing newspapers (registered with the Registrar of Newspapers) has also been exempted.        
	The exemption has been extended to raw jute and jute textile, seeds for food crops and fruits and vegetables, seeds for cattle feed, jute seeds, medicine/ pharmaceutical products and relief materials meant for victims of natural or other disasters.        
	The move was welcomed by exporters. A. Sakthivel, president of the Federation of Indian Export Organisations, said, To some extent, this will help us to reduce our cost. Especially people from Delhi, who send their goods by train to the Mumbai ports, will benefit.        
	Transport services through rail and waterways were included in the ambit of service tax in Union Budget 2009-10.         
	Service tax is levied at the rate of 10 per cent following a 2 per cent relaxation given in the stimulus packages announced earlier.

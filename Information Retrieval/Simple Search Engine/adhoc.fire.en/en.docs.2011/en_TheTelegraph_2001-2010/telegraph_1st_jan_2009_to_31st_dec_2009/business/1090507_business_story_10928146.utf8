          JAYANTA ROY CHOWDHURY AMP; R. SURYAMURTHY                          Pillai: Big challenge                                  
	New Delhi, May 6: A trade treaty that India was trying to restructure in favour of Nepal may run into trouble because of the political turmoil in Kathmandu.         
	India had agreed to allow Nepal to re-export goods from other countries with minimal value addition.         
	Nepal exports mostly textiles, snacks, threads and polyester yarn, some of them from China, to India.         
	India is also ready to open up trade through air. The access points would be New Delhi, Chennai, Calcutta and Mumbai.         
	At present, low value, or bulk products, go through land, with the Raxaul border accounting for two thirds of the trade.         
	Two more land routes through Brahmadandi and Tanakpur in west Nepal had also been agreed upon.         
	The negotiations are over. They only have to be signed. The new treaty for 10 years would address the concerns of the Nepalese side, said commerce secretary G. K. Pillai.         
	However, with the Prachanda government resigning and the country in a state of turmoil, the trade treaty may be put on the backburner.         
	The new treaty, which was being negotiated even before the old one had run out, was in response to Nepals demands that India should take steps to address the burgeoning trade deficit between the two countries.         
	Officials said the Himalayan nation might set up economic zones along the border where business houses, including Indian corporate giants, could set up shop to process goods, including semi-finished or knocked down products from China.        
	Nepals exports to India fetch just about 40 billion Nepalese rupees (Rs 1 = 1.6 Nepalese rupee), compared with imports from India worth 80 billion Nepalese rupees.         
	Imports from India include petroleum products, medicines, plants and machinery.        
	The officials said the new treaty was also in response to huge concessions which China was giving.         
	China was not only offering better trade terms but also finalising a treaty, which would respect Nepalese borders and promised not to attack the country. In return, Nepal would not allow its territory to be used by Tibetan emigres for anti-China activities.         
	The pact with China  dubbed the peace and friendship treaty  would have been signed by the Prachanda government but had to be cancelled after the constitutional crisis broke out in Nepal.        
	Most of the investments from India, which account for 44 per cent of FDI in Nepal, have been in ready-made garments, hotels, hospitals and food and beverages.

	New Delhi, Nov. 11: Honda Motor is working on another small car for India. However, it would not be a low-cost one.         
	Hondas announcement comes a day after Renault reiterated its commitment to launch a low-cost car.         
	India has great potential but we dont have any plan to launch a ULC (ultra low cost) car here. But we will like to offer a car to as many customers as we can at a price which match their expectations, said Takanobu Ito, president and CEO of Honda Motor, who took charge in June.         
	Sources say the company should come out with the small car  the second after the Jazz  in the next two to three years. The companys research and development division is working on such a product for the Asian markets, including India, he said.        
	But I cant say when we will formally come out with this product, he said.

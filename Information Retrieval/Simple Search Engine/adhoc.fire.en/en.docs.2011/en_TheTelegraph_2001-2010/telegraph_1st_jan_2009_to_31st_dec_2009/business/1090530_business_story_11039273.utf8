The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Banks under Moodys watch
                                                                                                               Banks under Moodys watch
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Mumbai, May 29: Moodys Investors Service has placed the ratings of 13 Indian banks, including the State Bank of India, under review for possible downgrade.         
	The global rating agency will now assess the governments ability to support the banking sector on the basis of the impact of the economic and financial crisis.        
	The list includes Bank of Baroda, ICICI Bank, Canara Bank, Bank of India, Axis Bank, HDFC Bank, IDBI Bank, Union Bank of India, Punjab National Bank, Central Bank of India, Syndicate Bank and Oriental Bank of Commerce.        
	Moodys believes that the global financial crisis is affecting the ability of national governments and their central banks to support their banking systems in certain markets.        
	In a report released earlier this month, the rating agency had pointed out that the prolonged and widespread nature of the current crisis had stretched government resources and restricted their policy options in supporting banks.        
	The rating agency said the review would look at the extent to which Indias ability to provide support to its banking system, if needed, was converging with the governments own debt capacity as a result of the ongoing global economic and credit crisis.        
	Moodys will refine its assessment of systemic support available from the Indian government to capture the impact of the erosion of the local economys underlying credit fundamentals and the reduced fiscal policy flexibility on the governments ability to support the banking sector, it added.        
	Factors that Moodys will consider in its assessment of systemic support include the size of the banking system in relation to government resources, the level of stress in the banking system, the foreign currency obligations of the banking system relative to the governments own foreign exchange resources and changes to the governments political patterns.        
	Reacting to the Moodys move, a banker, who did not wish to be identified, said while the Indian banking system was strong and it had withstood the current crisis, a possible downgrade could raise their cost of borrowings.         
	In the past, ICICI Bank, Axis Bank and the SBI among others have raised resources from the overseas markets.

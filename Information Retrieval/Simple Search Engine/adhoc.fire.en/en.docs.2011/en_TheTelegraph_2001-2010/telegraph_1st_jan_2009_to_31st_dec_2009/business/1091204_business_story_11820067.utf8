The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Sebi bars swap of funds
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Sebi bars swap of funds
                            
	Mumbai, Dec. 3 (PTI): Brokers cannot use funds from one clients account to buy securities or settle transactions of another client, Sebi said today. The move could instill greater discipline among market intermediaries.        
	There shall be no inter-client adjustments for the purpose of settlement of the running account, the regulator said. These conditions will not apply to institutional clients. The existing practice may continue for them, Sebi said.        
	Settlement of funds or securities shall be done within 24 hours of the payout, Sebi said.        
	Meanwhile, the Bombay Stock Exchange is set to kick off a mutual fund trading platform tomorrow with around 20 leading fund houses.        
	Through this platform, we will be facilitating an inclusive industry-wide participation of mutual fund players. Around 20 MFs have already agreed to join the platform, a BSE spokesperson said.

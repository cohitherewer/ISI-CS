          R. SURYAMURTHY                          More energy                                  
	New Delhi, Dec. 28: The government is now in a position to invite bids for the two large power projects in Tamil Nadu and Orissa, which have been dogged by land problems.        
	Power Finance Corporation Limited, the nodal agency for the large projects, will issue the request for qualifications by January 15.        
	Two ultra-mega power projects, one in Orissa and another in Tamil Nadu, are in the pipeline and the process for awarding them can begin next month, a senior power ministry official said.         
	Each of the projects has a capacity of 4,000MW and requires an investment of between Rs 16,000 crore and Rs 20,000 crore. Sources said the governments of both the states had completed the formalities of land acquisition and compensation.        
	The Tamil Nadu project, at Cheyyur, will be based on imported coal and provide electricity to the state as well as to neighbouring states.         
	The special purpose vehicle, Coastal Tamil Nadu Power Limited, has been formed as a fully owned subsidiary of PFC.        
	The project had been delayed for several months as compensation for the acquired land had proved to be a hurdle.        
	In Orissa, the state government has acquired land at Bedabahal in Sundergarh district, while the coal ministry has allocated blocks at Meenakshi, Meenakshi B and Meenakshi dipside for the project.        
	Sources pointed out that these projects, based on super critical technology, would evoke keen interest from domestic and international players as the power ministry has recently relaxed some norms.        
	It has allowed the sale of surplus coal from captive mines as well as power beyond 4,000MW at competitive rates.        
	The projects are given to those firms who qualify the technical and financial rounds and quote the lowest tariff.        
	Reliance Power has been the most successful company in terms of the large projects. It has already been awarded the projects at Sasan in Madhya Pradesh, Krishnapatnam (Andhra Pradesh) and Tilaiya (in Jharkhand). The project at Mundra in Gujarat has been awarded to Tata Power.        
	The large projects are critical to the governments efforts to enhance the countrys power generation capacity to meet the needs of an economy that is targeted to expand at more than 9 per cent a year by 2012.         
	India has a generation capacity of 155,859MW and plans to add 78,577 MW by 2012. The government has awarded four large projects to developers, but none of them are part of the Eleventh Plan target (2007-12).

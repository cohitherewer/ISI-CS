          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Feb. 23: The government today cleared proposals for setting up 10 special economic zones (SEZs) and a plan to merge three SEZs at Mundra in Gujarat.        
	The board of approval, chaired by commerce secretary G. K. Pillai, cleared the merger which would make the new entity the largest SEZ in the country.        
	The Adani group had sought the boards approval for the merger to lower its expenses on infrastructure, utilities and administration.        
	The SEZs are located near the Mundra port. Two of these will be multi-product zones, while the third will be a power facility. The combined area of the three SEZs is over 6,000 hectares.        
	The merger will help the promoter enjoy economies of scale. It will boost investment in such zones, which is needed at this juncture when the economy is facing a slowdown, said Lalit B. Singhal, director-general of the Export Promotion Council for SEZs and export-oriented units.        
	The board also approved the Navi Mumbai SEZs proposal to set up a gems and jewellery zone. The Navi Mumbai SEZ is promoted by Anand Jain, an aide of Reliance Industries chairman Mukesh Ambani.        
	Larsen amp; Toubros ship-building project also got a go-ahead from the board.

	Houston, May 21: Indian infotech majors are dealing with the economic downturn in their own unique ways.         
	Infosys, which slashed 2,100 jobs in India in April, now plans to hire about 1,000 people in the US in the next 12 to 18 months amid a gloomy job market. While the downturn takes its toll on pay packets, Infosys top brass, including its directors and senior-most management personnel, got a collective hike of over Rs 10 crore during the last fiscal.        
	At Wipro, chief Azim Premji has taken a cut of about 10 per cent in his annual compensation, while paying higher remuneration to other executive directors and senior management personnel in 2008-09.        
	On Infosys plans, chief executive Kris Gopalakrishnan, who is in Seattle for Microsofts CEO Summit this week, said the company planned to add more than 100 employees soon as part of a big US expansion in anticipation of growth resuming in 2010.        
	Altogether, Infosys plans to hire about 1,000 people across the US over the next 12 to 18 months, he said. Already, 14,000 of the companys 1,04,000 employees are based in the US.         
	We believe business will be there if we add capabilities, more services and solutions to our portfolio and increase the business volume with the existing customers  thats how we see growth coming to our business, Gopalakrishnan said.         
	On the recovery of the Indian economy, he said, It is in very early stages. I hope it is sustained and picks up.         
	The collective remuneration of all the board members and top management personnel rose Rs 10.28 crore to Rs 29.16 crore in 2008-09, according to the auditors report to the Infosys board.        
	Wipro chief Azim Premjis total remuneration dipped $32,414 (about Rs 14 lakh) in 2008-09 to $2,96,142 (about Rs 1.37 crore).        
	Indias third largest IT exporter, listed on the New York Stock Exchange, had paid a total remuneration of $3,28,556 to its chairman in the previous fiscal.        
	However, other executive directors and senior management personnel have received a pay hike, according to Wipros annual report filing with US market regulator SEC. The compensation paid to the non-executive directors also increased.        
	For its non-employee directors, Wipro said the attendance fee was raised to Rs 20,000 per meeting with effect from August 1, 2008, from Rs 10,000 previously. Besides, the company paid Rs 1.46 crore as commission to them in 2008-09, up from about Rs 86.02 lakh in the previous year.        
	The pay package for executive directors such as Suresh Senapaty, Pratik Kumar, Suresh Vaswani and Girish S Paranjape also rose in 2008-09.         
	Chief financial officer Suresh Senapaty got a payout of $408,246 in 2008-09, up from $317,751 in 2007-08. Similarly, the package of Pratik Kumar, executive vice-president (HR), rose from $230,507 to $290,201.        
	Suresh Vaswanis package rose to $420,607 from $315,013, while that of Girish Paranjape increased from $292,324 to $398,652. Both Vaswani and Paranjape are joint CEOs of Wipros IT Business. However, the remuneration for Vineet Agrawal, president, Wipro Consumer Care and Lighting, fell to $281,081 from $304,915 in 2007-08.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                           N. Chandrasekaran (left), CEO of TCS, with CFO S. Mahalingam in Mumbai on Friday. (PTI)                                  
	Mumbai, Oct. 16: Tata Consultancy Services (TCS), the countrys largest software services exporter, today beat analyst estimates with a 29.20 per cent rise in net profit for the second quarter ended September 30.         
	Consolidated net profit rose to Rs 1,642.21 crore from Rs 1,270.99 crore in the same period last year.         
	Analysts had estimated the Tata group company to report profits in the region of Rs 1,500 crore. They had also projected that TCS could report a sequential drop in profits. However, on a quarter-on-quarter basis, TCS reported a 7.1 per cent rise in net profit.         
	Good performances in some key verticals such as banking and financial services along with lucrative deals in a challenging environment jacked up the numbers.         
	It is a notch better than the last quarter, said N. Chandrasekaran, managing director and CEO of TCS. In the first quarter too, TCS had bettered analysts estimates.         
	The banking and financial services vertical continued to outperform, while others such as life sciences, healthcare, energy and utilities showed better than average growth.         
	Banking, financial services and insurance is the largest contributor to revenues. It accounted for nearly 45 per cent of the revenues in the second quarter, up from nearly 44 per cent in the preceding period.         
	Telecom, technology and manufacturing continued to show negative growth. However, Chandrasekaran said, the downtrend seems to have been arrested and there should be more stability in the future.        
	Revenues of Indias No. 1 software firm rose nearly 7 per cent in the quarter to Rs 7,435 crore on a year-on-year basis.        
	TCS has decided to pay 150 per cent of the quarterly variable pay in the period. This will be applicable for all eligible employees on the India payroll. To ensure that we have resources to participate in the recovery, we plan to recruit 8,000 professionals in the October-December quarter, Ajoy Mukherjee, vice-president, (head-global), human resources, said.         
	During the quarter, while TCS added 30 new clients, 5,530 employees joined the company. Attrition rate stood at 11.4 per cent.         
	UltraTech net        
	UltraTech Cement, an Aditya Birla Group company, today posted a profit after tax of Rs 251 crore for the second quarter of this fiscal, a rise of 53 per cent over that in the same period last year.        
	Net sales increased to Rs 1,541 crore in the latest quarter from Rs 1,396 crore a year ago, UltraTech Cement said in a statement to the Bombay Stock Exchange.        
	Cement production was higher by 12 per cent to 3.73 million tonnes in the quarter ended September 30.        
	UltraTech said it expected industry demand to grow at 9 per cent in 2009-10 given the governments initiatives to boost rural development, infrastructure and housing.        
	The company said the new capacities in the cement industry, which were at various stages of commissioning, would result in pressure on margins. The board of directors has re-appointed S. Misra as managing director of the company till March 31, 2010, subject to the approval of the shareholders.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | RBI walks a tightrope
                                                                                                               RBI walks a tightrope
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                            
	Mumbai, Oct. 26: The Reserve Bank of India today said the domestic economy faced both upside prospects and downside risks and that anchoring inflation expectations amid spiralling prices of essential commodities would prove to be a big challenge.        
	Releasing a document titled Macroeconomic and Monetary Developments: Second Quarter Review 2009-10, which will serve as the backdrop to its monetary policy review tomorrow, the central bank reiterated that managing the trade-off between growth and inflation posed a complex policy challenge.        
	The RBI mandarins will be looking closely at a wide range of growth forecasts  the latest being a survey of professional forecasters who have trimmed their growth projection for the year ended March 31 next to 6 per cent from 6.5 per cent earlier.         
	Just last week, the PMs economic advisory council had projected a growth rate of 6.5 per cent with the possibility of attaining 6.75 per cent. The most optimistic forecast has come from the National Council of Applied Economic Research, which projected a growth of 7.2 per cent back in July.        
	The RBIs mandarins  who are debating the timing of unwinding the central banks accommodative monetary policy adopted last year  will be looking closely at these forecasts before deciding whether or not to raise the rates and take other liquidity-draining measures such as a hike in the cash reserve ratio of banks.        
	Commenting on the growth outlook for 2009-10, the RBI listed a number of factors that supported the prospects of a faster and sustained recovery.        
	These include the impact of the policy stimulus, visible signs of industrial recovery, as seen by the 5.8 per cent growth in the index of industrial production during April-August 2009, a significant upturn in the business confidence as evident from different business expectations surveys, a revival in capital flows in the first half of 2009-10, higher resource mobilisation by companies in the first five months of 2009-10 and the improving overall global economic and financial conditions.        
	There are strong downside risks as well that can trammel the countrys growth prospects.         
	While there had been a deceleration in growth of private consumption and investment demand, the country also faced a deficient monsoon and drought-like conditions in several regions that affected kharif production and depressed rural demand.         
	The RBI said many companies did not fare well in the first quarter of 2009-10 and there had been a continued deceleration in non-food credit growth.        
	The central bank said though there were emerging signs of inflationary pressures, there were certain developments that could neutralise such pressures. However, the factors that support a possible firming up of headline inflation clearly overshadow those that may help in containing inflationary pressures.        
	Some of the factors that may rein in inflation include sluggish aggregate demand and negative output-gap, stabilisation of oil prices in the last few months and adequate buffer stocks of foodgrains.        
	However, it warned that emerging inflationary pressures might also persist and escalate further because of the fading away of the base effect, challenges in improving the supply situation of essential commodities in the short run, gradual pressure on global commodity prices and rising inflation expectations on account of elevated consumer price inflation.

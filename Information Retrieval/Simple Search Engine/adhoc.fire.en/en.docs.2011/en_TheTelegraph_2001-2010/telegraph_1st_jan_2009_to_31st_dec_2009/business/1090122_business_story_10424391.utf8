The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Bengal steel plant on China firm agenda
                                                                                                               Bengal steel plant on China firm agenda
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Calcutta, Jan. 21: Sinosteel  the second largest Chinese importer of iron ore  plans to build a one-million-tonne steel plant in Bengal.        
	The company has identified a location in West Midnapur for the proposed plant.        
	We need about 600 acres, Satyajit Singh, director of Sinosteel India, a subsidiary of the Chinese company, said. Singh was speaking on the sidelines of an international seminar organised by Steel Scenario.        
	Sinosteel is setting up a unit in Haldia to manufacture forged rolls for cold-rolling mills at an investment of Rs 100 crore. It has received 30 acres for the unit.        
	The Chinese company is also in talks with the Jharkhand government to set up a 5mt steel plant there. However, it is yet to get access to iron ore, land and water in the state.         
	As the Jharkhand facility will take some time to shape up, Sinosteel plans to set up a plant with a smaller capacity in Bengal. The company will expand the unit once it becomes profitable.        
	The unavailability of iron ore in Bengal will not come in the way of the companys plans.        
	Chinese companies produce steel at highly competitive prices, despite not having captive iron ore. So, it is not a problem for Sinosteel, Singh said.        
	The Bengal plant will be located close to the iron ore belts of Jharkhand and Orissa. The company plans to buy iron ore from miners.        
	However, Sinosteel will seek state assistance for coal blocks as it intends to set up a captive power plant. Initially, the company will produce long products for the construction industry. It may also tie up with a local partner.         
	Bengal has got 13 proposals for steel plants, but this is the first from an overseas company.        
	Iron ore import        
	Sinosteel plans to import more iron ore from India in 2009 than last year. Zhongtao Wang, director of the company, said it might import 15mt compared with 11mt in 2008.        
	Everything depends on what the Chinese governments policies will be. The first quarter will be crucial for the steel industry there, he said.

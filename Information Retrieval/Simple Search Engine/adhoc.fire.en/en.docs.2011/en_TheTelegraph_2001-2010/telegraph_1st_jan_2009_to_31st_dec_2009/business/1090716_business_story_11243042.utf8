          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, July 15: The government is ready with a contingency plan to boost the economy if the monsoon remains below normal.         
	There is no need to press the panic button. We have a contingency plan ready, finance minister Pranab Mukherjee said in the Rajya Sabha today.        
	I am not pessimistic like others. I still have hope. If we have a good monsoon, it is possible we will have a higher growth rate, he said.        
	What is required right now is to achieve high growth in the shortest possible time  this level of deficit is not sustainable and we shall correct it soon, he said.         
	The minister described the governments borrowing and high fiscal deficit as a tremendous risk we have taken with the hope that the economy will turn around. The finance ministry has projected a fiscal deficit of 6.8 per cent of gross domestic product for 2009-10.        
	There are early signs of a revival and a push now can see the economy recover faster, Mukherjee said.        
	Some of the positive signs are a 13 per cent growth in steel production, a 13.1 per cent rise in cement output, a growth of 14.3 per cent in the automobile sector, which was driven by a 17.4 per cent increase in demand for two-wheelers, the finance minister said.

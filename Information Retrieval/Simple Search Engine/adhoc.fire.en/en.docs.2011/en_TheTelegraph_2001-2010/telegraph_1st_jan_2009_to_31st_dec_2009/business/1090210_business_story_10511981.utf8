	New Delhi, Feb. 9: The economy is expected to grow 7.1 per cent in 2008-09, further raising hopes of a stimulus package.        
	Growth in the gross domestic product was 9 per cent in 2007-08 and 9.6 per cent the year before, according to the figures of the Central Statistical Organisation.         
	Growth is not going to be below 7 per cent in 2009-2010, said Suresh Tendulkar, chairman of the Prime Ministers economic advisory council.         
	He said agriculture, the balance of payments situation and increased demand from small enterprises should contribute to growth.        
	Manufacturing is likely to grow 4.1 per cent, half of the 8.2 per cent growth rate of a year earlier. Financial services are expected to expand 8.6 per cent compared with 11.7 per cent in 2008-09.

          JAYANTA ROY CHOWDHURY                                           
	New Delhi , Dec. 27: The Congress-led government plans to introduce in quick succession a coal sector regulator and limited auction of coal mines.        
	A draft cabinet note has been prepared for a regulator with power to grant licences, fix prices, set and enforce standards.        
	It will also promote competition, efficiency and prevent market domination, or cartelisation.         
	A regulator has become necessary as several end-user industries have been given mining licences, and they may soon be allowed to sell part of their produce in the open market.         
	At the same time, the government wants to bring in a transparent system of auctions to reduce the chances of scams in block allocation.         
	At present, coal-bearing land is allocated to steel mills, power plants and cement factories by the central government on the recommendations of state governments, but often questions of lack of transparency arise.         
	Officials said the coal regulator, mooted by the Prime Ministers Office several years back, had been supported by the Planning Commission.        
	The plan panel favours watchdogs for critical industries such as posts, ports, inland waterways, railways, mass transport and highways. Regulators now exist for oil and gas, and telecom.         
	The Planning Commission had last year framed a draft bill on regulators, which it wants to be the model for all sectors.         
	Block bidding        
	Besides the regulator, officials said amendments to the Mines and Minerals (Development amp; Regulation) Act 1957, which is expected to be passed either by Parliament in the next session or as an ordinance, would introduce competitive bidding for coal blocks.         
	Auctions in coal and iron ore mines were being opposed by mineral rich states, which felt they would compromise their ability to leverage mining concessions.         
	Under the present allocation system, states can ask the recipients of coal blocks or iron ore mines  mainly steel and power firms to set up facilities in lieu of the concessions.        
	However, the Centre is quite firm on holding auctions.        
	Officials said part of the money from the auction would be earmarked for rehabilitation and community development projects in the coal bearing areas, which are mostly on tribal lands. This is in the backdrop of tribal unrest in Jharkhand and Orissa over land.         
	Under the new system, competition among bidders will be in terms of production sharing  those who offer the highest production share to the state will get the mine on the block.         
	Successful bidders will also have to give a bank guarantee equal to three years of production share.         
	If the mine is not developed in time, these guarantees will be encashed and the leases cancelled.

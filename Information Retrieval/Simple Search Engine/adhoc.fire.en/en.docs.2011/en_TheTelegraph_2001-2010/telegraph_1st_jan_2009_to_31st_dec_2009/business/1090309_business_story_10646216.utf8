	Mumbai, March 8 (PTI): The State Bank of India has reorganised its wholesale banking division under a single platform.         
	Rather than providing just funds for projects, the division will offer many new services such as consultancy and treasury products.        
	The SBI has formed a core team of senior officials to drive the business and has been providing them expert guidance to cash in on the market opportunities, a highly placed SBI official said. With this, the SBI now offers its corporate clients an array of services on a single platform, he said.        
	The team is headed by a deputy managing director and has around 35 senior officials.

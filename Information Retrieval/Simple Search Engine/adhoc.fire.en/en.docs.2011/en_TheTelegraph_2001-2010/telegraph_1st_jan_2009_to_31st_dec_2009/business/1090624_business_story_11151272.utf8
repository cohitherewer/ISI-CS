	Calcutta, June 23: The Life Insurance Corporation of India will invest between Rs 40,000 crore and Rs 45,000 crore in stocks in 2009-10.         
	Last year (2008-09), we invested Rs 40,000 crore in equities and I think we are going to keep it at that level or a little more than that in the current financial year, LIC chairman T. S. Vijayan said on the sidelines of a seminar organised by Ficci here today.         
	The LIC manages assets worth Rs 8,50,000 crore, according to Vijayan. Our equity holding is 5 per cent of the total market capitalisation of all companies listed in the country, he said.        
	The state-owned life insurer, which witnessed a nearly 12 per cent decline in new business premium at Rs 52,953.92 crore in 2008-09 against Rs 59,182.20 crore a year ago, is eyeing a 25 per cent growth in first premium income in the current financial year.         
	We are targeting a total premium income of Rs 1,80,000 crore in 2009-10 compared with Rs 1,55,000 crore in the last financial year. We expect a 25 per cent growth in our new business premium, Vijayan said.        
	In April, the LIC had witnessed a 69 per cent growth in first premium income to Rs 2,113.11 crore from Rs 1,247.89 crore in the same month a year ago. All private life insurers taken together witnessed a decline in first premium income at Rs 1,488.48 crore compared with Rs 1,532.22 crore a year ago.        
	This is despite the fact that four private life insurers  Canara HSBC OBC Life, Aegon Religare, DLF Pharmacia and Star Union Dai-ichi  had entered the market last year.        
	Our business growth has been robust in May and June, said Vijayan.         
	The LICs total premium income in the first two months of the current financial year grew 28.39 per cent to Rs 5,354.92 crore from Rs 4,170.87 crore a year ago.

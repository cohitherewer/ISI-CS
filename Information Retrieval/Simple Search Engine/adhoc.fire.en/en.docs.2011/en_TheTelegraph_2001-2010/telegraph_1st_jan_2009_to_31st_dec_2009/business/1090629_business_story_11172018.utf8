The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Suzlon net profit falls 77% 
                                                                                                               Suzlon net profit falls 77% 
                            
	Mumbai, June 28 (PTI): Suzlon Energy, the countrys largest wind turbine maker, today reported a 77 per cent decline in net profit at Rs 236.48 crore in 2008-2009 on the back of currency losses and replacement of defective blades.        
	The companys net profit (after share in associates profit and minority interest) was Rs 1,030.10 crore in 2007-2008.        
	Revenues took a hit last year after some clients in the US cancelled orders and the company undertook the replacement of defective blades.        
	The blade retrofit programme is 80 per cent complete. We are slightly behind schedule but expect it to be completed by August. We dont expect any more provisioning for the retrofit programme, Suzlon Energy chief operating officer Sumant Sinha said.        
	In the January-March quarter this year, the company had set aside Rs 100 crore for the blade replacement programme, Sinha said.        
	Despite a challenging year, we have registered good growth at a consolidated level with sales growing to Rs 26,082 crore. There is an industry-wide slowdown in the immediate term, but I expect we will achieve 30 per cent growth levels in 2011-12, Sinha said.        
	Consolidated revenues expanded 91 per cent to Rs 26,082 crore in 2008-09 against Rs 13,679 crore in the previous fiscal. The Pune-based company has an order book position of Rs 7,901-crore as on June 25.        
	On a consolidated basis, we expect revenues in fiscal 2010 to be flat because the financial market has still not recovered completely. Interest rates are still high but we expect margins to improve a bit, Sinha said.

	New Delhi, Aug. 13: India today signed a free-trade agreement with the 10-member Association of Southeast Asian Nations (Asean) for duty-free trade in almost 4,000 products.        
	Signed after six years of negotiations, the pact is expected to boost trade by $10 billion to $50 billion by next year.         
	However, the agreement continues to face opposition in India, particularly in Kerala, where the state Congress is against the deal. This has prompted Prime Minister Manmohan Singh to set up a group of ministers to assess the impact of the pact on the domestic market, particularly on plantations.         
	Farmers fear that a lower duty on plantation crops will lead to an import deluge from Asean members such as Indonesia and Malaysia        
	Commerce minister Anand Sharma signed the agreement in Bangkok today. The pact, which will be implemented in phases, seeks to do away with the duties by 2016. The first phase will kick in from January 1, 2010.        
	The government also hopes that an agreement on trade in services and investment will be concluded by December, giving a boost to Indian businessmen.         
	Asean imported services worth around $180 billion in 2007. In view of Indias competitive advantages in terms of cost and expertise, the proposed agreement will benefit India, Ficci said.        
	On todays development, Biswajit Dhar, director-general of the Research and Information System for Developing Countries, said, It is a window of opportunity for the industry, especially at a time when the global economy is facing a slowdown.         
	Trade analysts said that the concerns of the auto component and the textile industries had been addressed as they had been put on the negative list.        
	However, they said, the concerns of the farmers from Kerala need to be addressed.        
	Refined petroleum products, organic chemicals, pharmaceuticals, gems and jewellery, metal scraps, which are among Indias major exports to Asean, are likely to be the gainers, said Chandrajit Banerjee, director-general of CII.        
	Auto components, several items of agriculture, textile and chemicals have been put on the negative list, which means there will be no tariff reduction.         
	Palm oil, tea, coffee and pepper are on the highly sensitive list, meaning import duties on them will be lowered to around 40-45 per cent only by 2019.

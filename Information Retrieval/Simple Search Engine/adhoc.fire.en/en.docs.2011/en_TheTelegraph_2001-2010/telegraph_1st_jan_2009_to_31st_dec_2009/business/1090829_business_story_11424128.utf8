          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Aug. 28: Hyundai Motor India plans to launch its sports utility vehicle Santa Fe in the country by next year.        
	The Korean company is also planning to introduce an 800cc small car by 2011 to compete with the Maruti 800.        
	We will bring the Santa Fe to India by next year and hope to bring an 800cc vehicle by 2011, said H.S. Lheem, managing director of Hyundai Motor India, at the annual convention of the Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers.        
	The launch of the Santa Fe  initially scheduled for this year  was postponed because of a demand squeeze. The SUV was showcased at last years auto expo here.        
	To be sold as a completely built unit, sources said, the car will be priced in the range of Rs 22 lakh to Rs 25 lakh.        
	Hyundai Motor India, the countrys largest car exporter, plans to raise its overseas sales this year. Last year, it exported 2.45 lakh units to over 100 countries and this year, the target is 2.7 lakh units.         
	Within the country, the aim is to sell 2.8 lakh units this year against 2.45 lakh units in 2008.        
	Hyundai has decided to make the hatchback i20 in Europe itself. This will be done to save logistics expenses and import duty in the European market, Lheem said.

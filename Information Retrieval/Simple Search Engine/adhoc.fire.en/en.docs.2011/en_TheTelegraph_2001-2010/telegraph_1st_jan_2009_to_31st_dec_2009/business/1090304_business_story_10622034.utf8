          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                               
	Mumbai, March 3: Pfizer Inc will source generic drugs from Hyderabad-based Aurobindo Pharma for sale in the US and Europe.         
	Under multiple agreements which were announced today, Pfizer will sell 39 generics in the US, 20 in Europe and an additional 11 in France. Therapeutic uses of the drugs range from fighting cardiovascular diseases to treating central nervous system disorders. The financial terms of the deals were not disclosed.         
	Pfizer  known for its patented drugs  is also concentrating on generics as competition from them is hurting its mainline products.        
	Other multinationals are also focusing on generics. Recently, Frances Sanofi-Aventis acquired Czech firm Zentive which is into generics while last year, Japans Daiichi acquired Indias Ranbaxy.         
	Pfizer said the deal was part of its initiative to expand its established products business unit, started last year.         
	We will dramatically change Pfizers established product portfolio to an engine of positive growth. These agreements represent solid, measurable progress, and a strong commitment to achieve our growth objectives, said David Simmons, president and general manager of Pfizers established products business unit.        
	According to Pfizer, the global market for generic drugs in the non-exclusive category is worth around $270 billion, with solid oral drugs forming the largest category. Over the next five years, the market may be over $500 billion.         
	Going forward, Pfizer plans to expand the established products business units portfolio through additional activities with Aurobindo and other companies to provide our customers with a wider product offering, Simmons said.         
	On the BSE, the shares of Aurobindo Pharma ended at Rs 157.50, up 7 per cent.

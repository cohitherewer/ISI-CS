	New Delhi, May 15: Bharti Airtel is open to acquisitions both within the country and abroad, with an eye to double its customer base in the next three years.        
	The company today announced that it had crossed the 100-million-customer-mark, beating rival Vodafone Essar by 26 million users.         
	Bharti is waiting for a change in merger rules before scouting for domestic takeover targets.         
	The Indian telecom sector is bound to see consolidation in the next few years ... Bharti is open to consolidation as and when the opportunity arises. However, there is nothing on the table at the moment, said Sunil Mittal, chairman and group CEO of Bharti Enterprises.        
	However, Mittal clarified that Bharti Airtel was not looking at a brand acquisition in India. For us the value from the acquisition has to be financial and not brand-based.        
	Analysts said Bharti could be more interested in new telecom firms with a sizeable presence in rural areas. Established players such as Vodafone or Idea might not be on their radar.        
	With 60 per cent of Airtels subscriber additions coming from rural areas, the telecom company could look at forming a deal with new players such as Loop, Swan or Datacom, said Sudipto Basu, an independent telecom analyst.        
	At present, the promoters of new companies cannot sell their shares for three years.        
	However, a department of telecom panel has recommended that merger rules in the sector be modified to allow the larger operators to buy the newer entrants to fulfill their spectrum requirements.         
	Bharti is also on the lookout for overseas buys, provided the price is right. There have been reports that Bharti is keen to enter the West Asian market either through acquisitions or by bidding for licences.         
	Last year Bharti had initiated talks with MTN of South Africa for a possible merger. However, the talks failed when MTN asked Airtel to become its subsidiary.

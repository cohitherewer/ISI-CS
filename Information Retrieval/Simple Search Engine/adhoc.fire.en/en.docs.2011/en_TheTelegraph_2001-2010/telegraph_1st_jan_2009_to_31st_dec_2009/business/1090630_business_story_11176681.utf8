	New Delhi, June 29: The government is planning a Rs 15,000-crore housing mortgage guarantee fund to cover home loans given to the urban poor.         
	An initial corpus for the fund may be announced in the upcoming budget.         
	Finance minister Pranab Mukherjee has held a meeting with Kumari Selja, the urban poverty alleviation minister, after she wrote to him on extra-budgetary measures such as a guarantee fund to enable the poor to build homes.        
	President Pratibha Patil had said that the government aimed to make India a slum-free nation in five years.         
	Both the ministries agree that money from the budget will not be sufficient.        
	The mortgage crisis in the US, which sent the global economy into a tailspin, was on account of bad loans given by financial institutions, under a scheme to make homes affordable for everyone.         
	This has made Indian banks wary of loans in housing, especially to the urban poor, from whom recovery may be a major problem.        
	A guarantee fund is expected to act as an insurance cover for bankers lending to the less affluent.        
	In the letter to Mukherjee, Selja had sought the creation of a housing mortgage guarantee fund.        
	Details of the fund are being worked out to make it a part of the Rajiv Gandhi Awas Yojana, a new scheme announced by the President earlier this month.         
	A fund with a corpus of Rs 15,000 crore for guaranteeing loans less than Rs 5 lakh by financial institutions to individuals is envisaged. An initial (budgetary) allocation of Rs 255 crore should suffice to start the fund, the letter stated.        
	Officials said the guarantee fund would help not only the poor but also the lower middle class who plan to buy houses for less than Rs 5 lakh. The guarantees will also attract the private sector to low-cost housing projects.         
	Around 8 million people living in the urban areas are below the poverty line, according to government data.

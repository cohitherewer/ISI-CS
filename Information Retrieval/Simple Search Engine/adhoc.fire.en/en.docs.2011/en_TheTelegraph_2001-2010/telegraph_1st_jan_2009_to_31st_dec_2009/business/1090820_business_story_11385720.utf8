          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Anil Ambani: Fight is on                                   
	New Delhi, Aug. 19: Anil Ambani today met UPA ministers to clarify his stand on the RIL-RNRL case and the ad campaign targeting petroleum minister Murli Deora and RIL, sources said.        
	Anil met finance minister Pranab Mukherjee and home minister P. Chidambaram, Planning Commission deputy chairman Montek Singh Ahluwalia, and other senior government officials.        
	The government also went into a huddle to finalise its strategy for the Supreme Court hearing of the RIL-RNRL case on September 1. The government has filed a special leave petition arguing that the gas belonged to it and challenged the ruling of Bombay High Court directing RIL to supply gas to RNRL at $2.34 per million British thermal unit.        
	The meeting of the ministerial panel headed by Pranab Mukherjee was inconclusive. The panel will meet again tomorrow. We are informally meeting to discuss the KG D-6 issue the gas utilisation policy is already in place, the finance minister said before the meeting.        
	The panel also discussed the ad campaign launched by Anil but decided against coming out with a counter campaign even though the ad had attacked the petroleum ministry on gas pricing, which incidentally was fixed by a group of ministers headed by Mukherjee.        
	Petroleum minister Murli Deora, law minister Veerappa Moily and power minister Sushil Kumar Shinde also attended the panel meet.        
	Prime Minister Manmohan Singh had formed the panel to co-ordinate the governments legal stand on two overlapping disputes  supply of gas by RIL to Anils RNRL, being heard in the Supreme Court; and the case between RIL and NTPC, which is being adjudicated in Bombay High Court.

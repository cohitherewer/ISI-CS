          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                                  
	This is so far the single largest investment in any pipeline by GAIL, chairman U.D. Chaubey said. The project will be implemented in two phases by 2012.        
	Gas from the pipeline will be used by fertiliser, power, steel, petrochemicals and small- and medium-scale units in eastern Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Jharkhand and Bengal. The pipeline will carry 32 million cubic metres of gas per day.         
	GAIL has already signed an agreement for natural gas to the Barauni plant of Urvarak Videsh, a joint venture of National Fertilizers Ltd, Rashtriya Chemicals and Fertilizers Ltd and Krishak Bharati Co-operative Ltd.        
	GAIL will supply 2.11 million cubic metres daily to the Barauni plant. The gas will be from the Krishna-Godavari basin and routed through the Jagdishpur- Haldia pipeline. Another customer is the proposed petrochemical unit of GAIL and Indian Oil Corporation at Barauni, which is in Bihar.         
	GAIL has also joined hands with Indian Farmers Fertiliser Cooperative Ltd for a gas-based power unit at Bettiah, which is in Bihar and on the route of the pipeline.        
	The project is in two phases, with the first phase having two stages and involving the construction of a main pipeline along with branch lines. In the beginning, 1,410km of pipeline will be laid from Haldia to Phulpur in Uttar Pradesh.        
	Major gas buyers on this route are the Durgapur and Barauni units of Hindustan Fertilizer Corporation Ltd, the Sindri and Barauni facilities of Fertilizer Corporation of India Ltd and power plants at Barh and Bettiah and the entities planning to supply gas to Patna, Chapra, Siwan, Gopalganj and Bettiah. They will be supplied gas through branch lines.        
	In the second stage of the first phase, 450km of branch lines will be laid for the entities supplying gas to Calcutta, Ranchi, Jamshedpur, Varanasi and Allahabad. Lines will also be laid out for gas to West Bengal Power Development Corporation Ltds (WBPDCL) project at Sagardighi.        
	Phase-II of the project will involve installation of a compressor in Haldia and the setting up of another 190 km of branch lines for gas to WBPDCLs Bandel and Katwa plants, Durgapur Projects Ltd, SAILs plants in Durgapur and Bokaro and a petrochemical facility at Barauni.

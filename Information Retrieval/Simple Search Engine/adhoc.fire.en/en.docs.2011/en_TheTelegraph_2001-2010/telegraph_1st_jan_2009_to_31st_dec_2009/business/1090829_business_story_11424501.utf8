	New Delhi, Aug. 28: Steel Authority of India Limited, fighting for about a decade to retain its tenuous control over Asias largest iron ore deposit at Chiria, has decided to go ahead with a two-phased, Rs 3,500-crore plan to produce more ore and set up a beneficiation plant in the Naxalite-infested area.         
	The plan envisages expanding mining from a mere 1 million tonnes (mt) per annum at Dhobil to 7 mt in two to three years by tapping new areas within Chiria such as Mclellan and Ajitaburu.        
	Subsequently, output will be raised to 15 mt by tapping the remaining leases such as Sukri in this forested zone.        
	The SAIL board has advertised for global consultants who will help it to develop the new mines and the iron ore beneficiation plant as well as a new township where a workforce numbering in thousands will be housed.         
	Sources said the total cost of the project would be about Rs 3,500 crore. The first phase, which involves taking mining operations to 7 mt per annum, will itself cost more than Rs 2,000 crore.         
	In this phase, SAIL will set up its first ore beneficiation plant.         
	Till now, it has only set up washeries at its mines, which do some minor beneficiation work.        
	With the Jharkhand government now in favour of letting SAIL continue its lease in Chiria, quick development of the area has become a necessity for the public sector steel behemoth.         
	SAIL needs ore for its Bokaro plant and subsidiary IISCO Steel Plant at Burnpur, Bengal. Moreover, it wants to prove to the Jharkhand government that it is serious about doing business in the state.        
	IISCOs capacity is being ramped up to 24 lakh tonnes per annum from just 4 lakh tonnes; Bokaros to 65 lakh tonne per annum from 38 lakh. At a later date, SAIL plans to set up a plant at Manoharpur, which will also feed on Chirias ore.         
	SAIL is dependant on Chiria for its ore need in the next decade. The PSU needs 47mt of iron ore by 2012-13, and much more after that.        
	However, mines at nearby Kiriburu and Meghataburu will be able to give it a maximum of 12 mt of ore. Another neighbouring mine Gua could give at most another 10 mt.         
	The mines at Bolani, Barsua and Kalta  all in Orissa  can give another 10 mt, 4.5 mt and 2 mt, respectively.        
	After IISCO was merged with SAIL, Chirias ownership was transferred to the latter.        
	Jharkhand had tried to take back part of the mines from SAIL and give them to private steel firms such as ArcelorMittal and Essar Steel, only to be refused by an appelate tribunal.

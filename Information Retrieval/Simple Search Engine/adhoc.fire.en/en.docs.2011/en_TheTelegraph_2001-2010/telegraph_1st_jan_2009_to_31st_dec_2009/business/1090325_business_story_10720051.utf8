The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | HK phone firm keen to expand operations
                                                                                                               HK phone firm keen to expand operations
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, March 24: Telecom service provider Pacnet will invest $200-300 million in the country over the next two to three years to expand Internet services, and plans to seek international long distance (ILD) and national long distance (NLD) licences.         
	The Hong Kong-headquartered company has increased its stake in its Indian joint venture  Pacific Internet India  to 74 per cent from 55 per cent and will shortly apply for the ILD and NLD licences.         
	Together with our joint venture partner, FutureWorld India, we have further capitalised Pacific Internet to support our network rollout in India after receipt of ILD and NLD licences, Bill Barney, CEO of Pacnet, said.        
	Pacnet has recently received approval from the Foreign Investment Promotion Board to increase its stake in the joint venture and to apply for the licences.        
	We look forward to obtaining the letter of intent from the department of telecom and will apply for licences next week, Barney said.        
	He hoped that India, which contributed around 10 per cent, or $70 million, to Pacnets global revenues in 2007, would account for about 25-30 per cent in the future. The company logged $500 million in global revenues in 2008.         
	India will remain one of the worlds fastest growing markets and the country will continue to be resilient despite the current global economic slowdown. Pacnet remains committed to grow our operations here, he said.        
	Upon approval of the licences, Pacnet will offer its suite of network services, including direct Internet access and managed services.

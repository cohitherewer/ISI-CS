The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Bank floats on govt agenda
                                                                                                               Bank floats on govt agenda

	New Delhi, June 9: The government may allow at least six state-run banks to come up with public offerings and raise their capital base.         
	The public offerings could raise between Rs 6,000 crore and Rs 8,000 crore.        
	Banks likely to issue shares include the Bank of India, the Central Bank of India, Canara Bank, Indian Bank and the United Bank of India.        
	Since the government owns substantial stakes in the target banks, its decision to dilute a 5-7 per cent stake may be easily accepted by the members of the ruling coalition, such as the Trinamul Congress, who are otherwise opposed to selloffs.        
	In Indian Bank and the Central Bank of India, the government holding is 80 per cent, while it is 73 per cent in Canara.         
	Officials said the intention was to limit the number of banks making an issue as a large flood of offerings could hit banking stocks as a whole.         
	No fund manager puts all his eggs in one basket. And none will just invest in banking, so the number of and amount of banking IPOs on offer has to be kept in check, said market analyst Sudatta Sengupta.         
	Most of the banks seeking to float offerings have to shore up their capital base as they will not be permitted to give fresh loans or accept new deposits beyond a limit.        
	Finance ministry officials said banks which were not yet listed needed to be brought onto the stock market as their true value had to be determined prior to any plan for a mega merger.         
	The government feels mergers are needed ahead of the Indian financial market opening up to large foreign banks, who have considerable cash power.        
	US and European countries have long been demanding greater access to the Indian financial markets in return for concessions in the services sector.        
	Such negotiations may start after the conclusion of the Doha round of WTO talks.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Spectrum bidders in time chase
                                                                                                               Spectrum bidders in time chase
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                                            
	New Delhi, Oct. 4: Bidders for third-generation spectrum expect the telecom department to come out with a revised schedule that would give them more time to examine tender documents.         
	A tender document is a proposal inviting bids along with a copy of the licensing policy and detailed auction guidelines. The document is usually released at least three to four months ahead of the bidding.        
	The DoT, which is yet to release the tender document, had set October 8 as the deadline for submitting questions for a pre-bid conference. The telecom ministry was supposed to release the document on September 29.        
	DoT officials said the document was ready and would be made public soon.         
	However, no specific date has been given.        
	The information memorandum is yet to be released. There is no clarity on various issues related to the bidding process. We will need adequate time to plan for the multi-billion dollar 3G bid. A fresh timeline is required, said an executive from a top telecom firm.        
	Prospective bidders have raised four basic questions: when and how would additional spectrum be allocated, would rollout norms differ for 2G and 3G services, what would be the call termination charges for 3G, and what would be the norms for winning entities merging or acquiring an existing player.        
	Foreign players, who have been allowed to bid as 100 per cent entities, are worried about getting the approval of the Foreign Investment Promotion Board and finding a domestic ally  essential to start operations  after the bid.        
	Global names such as AT amp;T of the US, Germanys Deutsche Telekom, France-based Orange and Japans NTT DoCoMo are not convinced with the DoTs argument of imposing a Rs 1,651-crore fee for acquiring a licence over and above the 3G bid price. The government hopes to raise around Rs 25,000 crore from the sale of both 3G and WiMax spectrum.        
	3G services allow mobile phone users to surf the Internet or download content, including music and video, at a faster speed.

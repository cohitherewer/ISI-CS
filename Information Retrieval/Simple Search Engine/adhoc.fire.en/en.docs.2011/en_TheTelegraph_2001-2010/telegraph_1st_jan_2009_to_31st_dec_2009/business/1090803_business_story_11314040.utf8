The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Anil sees Rs 30,000cr   NTPC loss
                                                                                                               Anil sees Rs 30,000cr   NTPC loss
                                  
	New Delhi, Aug. 2 (PTI): Anil Ambani today warned that NTPC could lose up to Rs 30,000 crore if it did not get gas at the committed rate of $2.34 per million British thermal unit (mBtu) from Reliance Industries Ltd.         
	He said the power PSU was an innocent victim of Mukesh Ambani-led RILs corporate greed.         
	Offering every possible co-operation to NTPC, Ambani sought a meeting with power minister Sushil Kumar Shinde to clarify that his group company Reliance Natural Resources Limited (RNRL) was not at all attempting to scuttle the PSUs chance of getting 12mmscmd gas, contrary to speculative media reports and misinformation campaign by vested interests.        
	In a letter to Shinde, Ambani  who is fighting a bitter battle with RIL for getting 28mmscmd gas at $2.34 per mmBtu  said, We firmly believe that NTPC, like RNRL, is an innocent victim of RILs corporate greed, which is reflected in its attempt to back out of its solemn and legal contractual commitments.

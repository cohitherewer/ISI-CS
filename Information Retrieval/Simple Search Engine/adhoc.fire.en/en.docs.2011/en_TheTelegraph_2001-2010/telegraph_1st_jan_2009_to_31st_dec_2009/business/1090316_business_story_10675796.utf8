The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | SBI sees a hit in cheap home loan scheme
                                                                                                               SBI sees a hit in cheap home loan scheme
          VIVEK NAIR                          Success story                                  
	Mumbai, March 15: The State Bank of India (SBI) is well on its way to meet the target of its discount home loan scheme.        
	Already, the bank has sanctioned Rs 1,300 crore in February  the first month of the offer  compared with the target of Rs 4,500 crore till April, when the scheme expires.        
	Under it, home buyers will pay an 8 per cent interest rate for loans up to Rs 20 lakh for one year, after which the rates will be realigned.        
	SBI officials said they had overtaken Housing Development Finance Corporation (HDFC) and ICICI Bank to become the highest home-loan lender. The response to the scheme has been excellent. We have seen volumes going up 50 per cent on a year-on-year basis. We sanctioned Rs 1,300 crore in February itself, which is a record for a month. For the next two months, the figure could be higher, a senior SBI official said.         
	Analysts feel the bank may offer more such attractive schemes as it wants to keep the momentum going. Besides, it is likely that policy-makers will follow an easy rate regime.        
	At present, HDFC is the No. 1 player, and the SBI is aiming for that position. We would like to be there as fast as possible, the SBI official said.         
	Following the SBIs offer, other banks have also come out with discount schemes.         
	The Central Bank of India froze lending rates on new housing loans up to Rs 20 lakh at eight per cent for one year. The PSU bank is planning to disburse at least Rs 500 crore. Canara Bank is offering loans up to Rs 30 lakh at a cocktail of rates. It is 8.25 per cent for the first year, 9.25 per cent for the next 48 months and prime lending rate minus 2.50 per cent, subject to a minimum of 10 per cent, thereafter. The scheme is till December.         
	Though banking circles feel that the eight-per-cent scheme can wean existing customers from competitors, the SBI official said that was not the banks intention.        
	We only wanted to offer a value proposition. Though there are instances of switching, we are not banking on it, the official said, adding that the SBI was also providing complete transparency. Customers are shown the EMI which they will pay for the first 12 months and thereafter, he said.         
	Analysts are divided over the impact. While some feel the SBIs scheme can be profitable, others think that it will not lead to any significant savings.

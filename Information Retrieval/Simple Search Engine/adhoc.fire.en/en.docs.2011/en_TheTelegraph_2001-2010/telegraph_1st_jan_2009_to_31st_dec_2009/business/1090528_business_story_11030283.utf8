   Pranab priority to growth           OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Finance minister Pranab Mukherjee with ministry officials in New Delhi on Wednesday. Picture by Prem Singh                                        
	New Delhi, May 27: The Congress-led government will push forward pending reforms, including those in the financial sector, Pranab Mukherjee said here today.         
	The finance minister, slated to present the budget in the first week of July, said though the budget would continue to focus on the common man, reviving growth would remain a priority.         
	We need to seize the opportunity presented by the current circumstances to push forward long-pending reform measures. These include measures in the financial sector and the real economy, he said.        
	The sensex today rose 520 points on Mukherjees comments, with realty, banking and commodity stocks showing heavy gains. It ended the day at 14109.64 points, after touching an intra-day high of 14122.78 points. The National Stock Exchange index Nifty spurted 159.35 points, or 3.87 per cent, to 4276.05.        
	According to finance ministry officials, the first batch of reforms could include a bill on a pension regulator, permission to private pension funds to float schemes and consolidation of state-run banks into larger, more powerful entities. Also on the agenda are plans to fine-tune FDI rules to bring in more investments in key sectors.         
	However, financial sector reforms would be handled with caution and controversial moves, such as allowing foreign banks to have greater voting rights in Indian banks, may be put on the back burner.         
	Mukherjee made it clear that infrastructure spending would be one of the cornerstones of the new government.         
	The infrastructure projects in the pipeline will be re-appraised and made more robust. Where necessary policy and procedures will be calibrated to boost infrastructure spending.        
	Officials said steps might be taken to change rules on infrastructure funding. The sector is expected to create large numbers of jobs and demand in the economy.        
	However, Mukherjee feels schemes to generate more jobs and growth are not possible without increased spending and incremental borrowing, which need to be continued in 2009-2010.        
	The government would, for the time being, go soft on its fiscal prudence requirements, which call upon it to narrow the deficit to near zero  a plan criticised by global bankers and rating agencies.         
	The prophets of doom have been unduly focusing on increased public spending and a consequent increase in the fiscal deficit, Mukherjee said.        
	An early return to our recent growth performance will help us get back to our preferred path of fiscal prudence.        
	Mukherjee said he expected the fiscal deficit for the current year to remain at 5.5 per cent. This will place a cap on government borrowings at about Rs 3,30,000 crore.

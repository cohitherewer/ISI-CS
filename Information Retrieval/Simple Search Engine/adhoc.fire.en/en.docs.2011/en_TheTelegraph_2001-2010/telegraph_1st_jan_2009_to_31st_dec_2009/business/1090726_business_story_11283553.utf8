          A STAFF REPORTER                                    
	Calcutta, July 25: MCX Stock Exchange (MCX-SX) hopes to complete offloading its stake in the next two to three months, chief executive officer Joseph Massey said today.        
	The company, which has already diluted about 30 per cent stake, still needs to offload 50 per cent to start operations.        
	MCX-SX is in talks with foreign investors, which could include overseas stock markets, fund managers and investment banks.        
	The stake sale is crucial for getting approval from the Securities and Exchange Board of India as the norms prohibit promoters from holding more than 15 per cent in an exchange. Also, no single investor should hold more than 5 per cent stake in exchanges.         
	MCX-SX has already sold 18 per cent stake to domestic banks  Union Bank of India, Bank of India and Andhra Bank, Massey said on the sidelines of a programme organised by the CII (eastern region) today.

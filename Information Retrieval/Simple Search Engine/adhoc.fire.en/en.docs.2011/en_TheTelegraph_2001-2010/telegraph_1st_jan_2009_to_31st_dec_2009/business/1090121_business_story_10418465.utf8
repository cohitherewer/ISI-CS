	Calcutta, Jan. 20: Calcutta Port Trust will have to acquire private land without the involvement of the state government to build the proposed container terminal at Diamond Harbour.        
	The government has asked the port trust to call an all-party meeting to build consensus for land acquisition.         
	The district magistrate usually takes up the responsibility to convene meetings to stress on the need for land in such projects.         
	The port trust will shortly call a meeting of all stakeholders, officials said.         
	The port plans to acquire 116 acres to build the terminal. It needs to acquire about 40 acres of private land.         
	The state and central government agencies own the rest.        
	The port trust wants to build four jetties and three barge terminals to handle container cargo of 1.6 million tonnes at an investment of about Rs 1,250 crore.         
	Observers said the state wanted to distance itself from the land acquisition process for fear of queering the pitch for the project.        
	SCI plan        
	The Shipping Corporation of India (SCI) will wait for fresh orders for vessels at least till March and review the situation later, chairman and managing director S. Hajara said at a seminar by the Bengal Chamber of Commerce and Industry.

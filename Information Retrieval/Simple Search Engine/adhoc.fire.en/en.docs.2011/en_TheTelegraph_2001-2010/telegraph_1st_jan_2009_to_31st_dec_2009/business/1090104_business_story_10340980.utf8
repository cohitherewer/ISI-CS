The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Oil PSU officers plan strike
                                                                                                               Oil PSU officers plan strike
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Stern move                                  
	New Delhi, Jan. 3: Officers of state-run oil companies plan to go on an indefinite strike from Wednesday, even after the government set up a panel headed by home minister P. Chidambaram to look into their demand for higher wages.        
	This so-called panel (announced yesterday evening) has not been officially notified. There are no terms of reference or a time frame for addressing our issues  it is merely an eye wash, Amit Kumar, president of the Oil Sector Officers Association (OSOA), told reporters.        
	We have been left with no option but to resort to a strike because of a series of betrayals. We have been told that our demands were being considered but the end result is there for all to see, Amit said.        
	The group of ministers (GoM), similar to the one set up to look into the demands of armed forces, will include petroleum minister Murli Deora, minister of state for finance P.K. Bansal and heavy industries minister Santosh Mohan Dev.        
	Kumar said the strike by officers of all the four PSU firms would result in a loss of nearly Rs 2,000 crore per day for the oil companies and the government.        
	The strike will disrupt fuel supplies to airlines and slowly affect auto fuel and cooking gas supplies.        
	Refineries and oil fields will suffer and some old ones may not be able to start production again.        
	The OSOA has submitted a 13-point charter of demands, which includes categorising all oil sector PSUs in the highest A+ category, thereby entitling workers to the best remuneration available for a government-sector company.        
	Kumar said the wage hike approved by the government last month worked out to Rs 3,989 per month at the entry level and Rs 2,217 at the highest level.        
	The association is also seeking open-ended pay scales, removal of the ceiling of 50 per cent of basic pay on perks and allowances and a wage revision every five years.                          
	, and maintaining the same annual and promotion increment levels of four and six per cent, already in vogue.        
	The proposed strike, the OSOA said, would result in a Rs 183 crore per day revenue loss for ONGC on account of crude oil production, and sale of gas and value-added products. For all upstream companies put together, the revenue loss would add up to Rs 225 crore per day.        
	IOC would lose Rs 600 crore per day in revenue and all retailers put together would lose over Rs 900 crore per day. The loss on excise duty to the government is expected to be over Rs 100 crore a day, it said.

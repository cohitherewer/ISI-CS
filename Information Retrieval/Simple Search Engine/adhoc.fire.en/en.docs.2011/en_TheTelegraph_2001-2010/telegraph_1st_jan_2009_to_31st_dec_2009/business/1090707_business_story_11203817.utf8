The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Resource mop-up strategy holds the key
                                                                                                               Resource mop-up strategy holds the key
										      GUEST COLUMN - NITISH SENGUPTA                        
	Pranab Mukherjee has patted himself on his back for giving us a budget of the value of Rs 10 lakh crore against the meagre Rs 196 crore, in the first budget of independent India. He could also have dwelt on the vastly contrasting scenarios between now and in 1984 when he presented his last budget in a regulatory regime.         
	Todays UPA government is not a regulatory government. Mukherjee has been lavish in his allocations. This budget is unique in one respect viz. the lavish allocation of resources allotted to the social sector and the infrastructure sector. It has supported schemes like NREGA or providing foodgrain to the poor or providing for compulsory female literacy and funds have been assigned liberally to these schemes. The same way infrastructure sector or schemes in areas like energy security or global warming have been given budgetary support and also areas like Rajiv Gandhi drinking water mission have received lavish support. If all these promised funds are actually made available and put to good use, India will no doubt be a model state in the next few years. But this is to be contrasted with the fact that there is no matching proposal for raising such massive resources.         
	Pranab babu has preferred to retain the corporate and personal tax rates unchanged and he is hoping to raise the required resources from the existing resources by better tax administration and better realisation. He has spoken about the exemptions in Indias tax rates, but has not done any thing to remove them. He has offered attractive tax concessions to the salaried class, the middle class, senior citizens and women which will no doubt make him popular. He has accepted the principle of one rank one pension for jawans and officers and this accounts for massive expenditure.        
	Some of the highlights are the abolition of FBT, marginally raising the standard deduction rate for women and senior citizens and rationalisation of the service tax. The sizeable boost to the plan will no doubt raise fiscal deficit further, especially because the matching revenue resources are not there. He has left the rate as they are and proposes to rely on proper tax administration based on the existing rates to raise sufficient additional resources. One hopes that these expectations will prove right.         
	If not, there will be very abnormal deterioration of the fiscal deficit ratio. This factor, added to the fact that Mukherjee apparently did not take the call from the Economic Survey for a reform agenda in a number of areas including divestment, has led to some misapprehension in the stock market which has reacted adversely by dropping over 850 points after the budget. But one hopes that this is a false alarm and that once the market appreciates the implications of several others measures such as the abolition of the fringe benefit tax (FBT) and the commodities transaction tax, mature views will prevail on the stock market.         
	As in the income tax so also in the area of customs and central excise. Pranab babu has settled for minimal changes in the tax rates and only rationalisation.         
	He has increased the import duty on silver, but exempted branded jewellery from central excise. Levying a small customs duty of 5 per cent on imported set-top boxes is a salutary measure. He has proposed special dispensation for handlooms not only in Tirupur and Bhiwandi, but also his beloved Shantipur and Dhanekhali. He has also provided an assistance of Rs 1,000 crore for restoration work in Aila-affected Bengal.

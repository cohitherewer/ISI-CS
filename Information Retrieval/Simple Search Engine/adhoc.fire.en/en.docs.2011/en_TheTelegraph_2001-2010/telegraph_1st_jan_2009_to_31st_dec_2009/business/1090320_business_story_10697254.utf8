	Calcutta, March 19: Mercedes-Benz India is planning to tie up with state transport undertakings to sell low-floor buses. The company started rolling out buses last year.        
	After launching inter-city luxury coaches, we are now looking at other segments such as intra-city luxury buses, low-floor city buses and three-axle buses, Manas Dewan, GM (corporate communications) of Mercedes-Benz India, said at the launch of the SUV M-Class in the city today.         
	The company is conducting a study on the suitability of its buses for cities and may refurbish them to suit customer needs, Dewan said.        
	Mercedes has sold around 25 buses to inter-city operators. Volvo, its main competitor, has sold its air-conditioned buses to some state bodies.         
	On the used-car business, Debashish Mitra, director (sales and marketing), said, We are working on a plan for a global model for pre-owned Mercedes cars. Sources say Mercedes-Benz is likely to start the business this year itself.        
	Mitra said the company hoped to maintain its growth rate in India in 2009. Mercedes-Benz India sold 3,625 cars last year.         
	GM Spark        
	General Motors India, which unveiled the Spark Muzic special edition in the city today, hopes to maintain the growth momentum this year. Last year, the company registered a 114 per cent growth in Spark sales.        
	GM plans to manufacture only 1,500 units of the Spark Muzic in India, said Ankus Arora, vice-president (marketing, sales, aftersales) of GM India. The special edition cars will be available in March and April only and are targeted at the youth.        
	The car comes with features such as a double DIN audio head unit with a hi-fidelity 4-speaker system and a sports seat fabric. The exterior of the car has graphics.

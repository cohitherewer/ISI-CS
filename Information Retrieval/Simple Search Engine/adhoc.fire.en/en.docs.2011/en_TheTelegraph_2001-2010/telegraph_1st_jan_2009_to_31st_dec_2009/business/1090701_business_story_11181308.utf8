          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Green shoots                                  
	New Delhi, June 30: The developers of special economic zones (SEZ) can finance infrastructure projects through foreign borrowings.        
	While easing the norms for external commercial borrowings (ECBs) today, the government, however, barred the developers from using foreign funds for integrated townships and commercial real estate within SEZs.         
	Infrastructure, according to ECB norms, includes power, telecom, railways, roads, bridges, ports, industrial parks and urban amenities such as sanitation and sewage facilities.         
	This is an important step and provides an opportunity for developers to tap the global market for resources especially when there is a lack of funds domestically, L. B. Singhal, director-general of the export promotion council for EoUs and SEZs, said.        
	The economic slowdown has halted the rush for SEZs. Leading developer DLF had moved the government to get some of its zones denotified. Many others have sought time to complete their projects because of a funds crunch.        
	Exports from SEZs grew 36 per cent to Rs 90,416 crore in 2008-09 from Rs 66,638 crore in the previous fiscal. The government has given formal approvals to 568 projects and notified 315 of them.        
	The government, as part of Export-Import Policy 2002- 07, had allowed SEZ developers to raise ECBs up to $500 million for maturities of less than three years. The permission, however, was not renewed.        
	More reliefs        
	For realty firms outside SEZs, the finance ministry today extended the use of ECBs for integrated townships for another six months till December. The minimum area to be developed should be 100 acres.        
	Overseas borrowing rules for non-banking finance companies engaged in funding infrastructure projects were also relaxed.

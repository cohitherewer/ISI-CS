          OUR CORRESPONDENT                          Connecting call                                  
	New Delhi, Dec. 24: State-run Bharat Sanchar Nigam Ltd has submitted a financial bid for a 75 per cent stake in Zambia Telecommunications Ltd (Zamtel).        
	The names of the shortlisted bidders will be announced on January 11, and companies will be invited to take part in the next phase of the selloff.        
	Based on our due diligence, a financial bid has been submitted, said company officials. BSNL is also looking for other opportunities in Africa.        
	The PSU has shortlisted eight consultants, including Ernst amp; Young, McKinsey, KPMG and PricewaterhouseCoopers, to advise it on mergers and acquisitions, strategic partnerships and overseas forays.        
	BSNL had earlier planned to bid for Kuwaits Zain Telecom. Its recent bid for Millicoms Sri Lankan operations was rejected as the price quoted was below expectations.        
	State-run Zamtel is Zambias only licensed fixed-line provider of voice and data communications. Zambia plans to sell up to 75 per cent in the telecom venture as part of a privatisation move. Its revenues for the year to December-end were $100 million.        
	The foremost criteria we are looking for is to get the best price for the shares. We are also looking for a partner who will give the best long-term value to the company, Muhabi Lungu, acting director-general of the Zambia Development Agency (ZDA), said.        
	A technical team of experts will evaluate the bids and submit them to the ZDA board for further scrutiny. The ZDA will subsequently announce the shortlisted candidates on January 11.        
	Angolas Unitel and Libyas LAP Green Networks have also put in their bids.         
	Eight companies and consortiums were asked to bid for a stake of 51-75 per cent in Zamtel.

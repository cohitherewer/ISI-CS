The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Car makers seek more incentives
                                                                                                               Car makers seek more incentives
										      GARIMA SINGH NEOGY                              Big appetite				                                 
	New Delhi, June 18: The auto industry wants a lower excise duty and cheap credit in this years budget. Also on the wish list are export sops and more tax concessions for sale in rural areas.        
	The two stimulus packages announced earlier had helped revive sales.         
	Manufacturers are now seeking further incentives to maintain growth momentum.        
	There should be no reversal of the stimulus packages. The excise cut has helped in creating and sustaining demand so far, said Pawan Goenka, president (automotive sector), Mahindra amp; Mahindra.        
	However, the government is disappointed with the reluctance of car makers to cut prices. This might influence its decision on more sops, officials said.        
	The Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers (Siam) said in the absence of incentives, sales of passenger vehicles would have been down 3 per cent and commercial vehicles by as much as 30-40 per cent.        
	Last year, the slowdown had hit the sales of cars, two-wheelers, trucks, buses and three-wheelers, prompting the government to take action.         
	In December, it slashed excise duty on all classes of vehicles by 4 per cent, leading to price cuts of up to Rs 2 lakh.         
	The move saw cars and two-wheelers reporting double-digit growth. Sales of trucks, however, continued to decelerate.         
	The industry is also eyeing easy credit along with lower interest rates on auto loans.        
	Finance should be easily available to customers and for this, banks should be encouraged, said a spokesperson for Hyundai Motor India.        
	Siam has asked the government to remove the additional levy on big cars as it has skewed the market in favour of smaller models.         
	Cars less than four metres in length with 1,200cc petrol and 1,500cc diesel engines are taxed at 8 per cent.         
	All other cars attract an excise duty of 20 per cent. Bigger cars attract an additional duty of Rs 15,000 on models with 1,500-1,999cc engines, and Rs 20,000 on models with 2,000cc or bigger engines.        
	While the incentives for small cars are welcome, the government is discouraging big cars. Also, utility vehicles that are used in rural areas are being hit badly, said Sugato Sen, director of Siam.         
	The business lobby has sought tax concessions for vehicles used in the rural areas.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Tribunal sees little merit in GSM plea
                                                                                                               Tribunal sees little merit in GSM plea
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, March 31: The telecom tribunal today said GSM operators had no right to get spectrum beyond 6.2 megahertz. Spectrum are airwaves which carry voice calls.         
	Earlier, the Cellular Operators Association of India (COAI) had contended that existing guidelines of the department of telecom (DoT) entitled GSM operators to a maximum of 15Mhz of second generation (2G) spectrum per circle, subject to their meeting certain predefined subscriber norms.         
	We hold that there is nothing in either the National Telecom Policy 1999 or licence conditions to support the contention of the COAI that they have vested rights to 15Mhz, said the bench.         
	The tribunal also upheld a dual spectrum allocation policy that allowed CDMA players such as Anil Ambanis R-Com and the Tatas to get GSM spectrum.        
	Rejecting GSM operators allegations, the Telecom Disputes Settlement and Appellate Tribunal (TDSAT) said, We do not find any ground to level malafide intention on the part of the DoT and hold that the issue of early completion of formalities is not a matter that would require intervention at our level.        
	After the DoTs decision on October 18, 2007 that amended the telecom licence allowing CDMA players to enter the GSM mobile space, the COAI had questioned the manner in which telecom minister A. Raja had implemented the decision.        
	The tribunal, however, also slammed Trai for not following uniform procedure while recommending subscriber-linked criteria for the allocation of additional spectrum and asked the government to revise the rule.

          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Oct. 8: The finance and investment committee of the Employees Provident Fund Organisation (EPFO) today deferred a decision to invest the funds money in stock markets.        
	Sources say the key advisory body of the EPFO will take a final view on stock market investment on October 24.         
	As proposed, if the EPFO decides to park 3-5 per cent of its Rs 2.57 lakh crore corpus in equity or other instruments, it will result in about Rs 13,000 crore flowing into capital markets.        
	Several trade union representatives are against the idea of EPFO investing in stock markets and have argued that it was not proper to invest retirement funds in risky instruments.        
	At an earlier meeting on August 18, an EPFO official had suggested that instead of buying stocks directly, the organisation could look at investing in stock indices.        
	The finance ministry had first mooted the idea of investing 15 per cent of the EPFO corpus in equity to increase returns on investment.        
	However, the advisory body had shot down the proposal in August last year, citing volatility in the stock markets.        
	During the August meeting, it was felt that alternative avenues were a must to enhance or maintain overall returns to subscribers as fixed-income products would lessen in future.        
	Investment in equities provide a good hedge against inflation, unlike fixed income securities.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Jute norms eased
                                                                                                               Jute norms eased
          AMIT CHAKRABORTY                              
	Calcutta, June 25: The Union food ministry today decided to dilute the mandatory jute packing order by as much as 50 per cent for the procurement of kharif crops.        
	It also allowed the import of jute bags to meet the emergency packing needs of food grains. Sources said the ministry felt the industry was not in a position to meet the higher demand for bags.        
	At an emergency meeting of the food ministry, it was estimated that the demand for bags would be around 14 lakh bales  40 per cent higher than last years 10 lakh bales. On top of it, the ministry estimated that the supply of the bags would have to be made available to the procurement agencies by September against November in normal circumstances.        
	Two city-based industry representatives, who attended the meeting, said the food ministry had asked State Trading Corporation of India Limited to explore the possibility of the import of jute bags.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Bengal to add fresh names on infotech list
                                                                                                               Bengal to add fresh names on infotech list
          A STAFF REPORTER                          Das: Extend support                                  
	Calcutta, Feb. 23: The number of new infotech players in Calcutta are expected to be higher this fiscal, at a time when the industry is feeling the heat of global recession.        
	According to Bengal IT minister Debesh Das, 30 firms have set up shop till now, and the final figure for 2008-09 is expected to be higher than last fiscals 33.        
	We always give importance to the small and medium IT firms and try to facilitate them to grow, Das said at the inauguration of MSR IT Solutions data centre last week.        
	MSR intends to hire over 500 in Calcutta by 2010. The company has 75 professionals in Calcutta and about 50 in the UK.         
	Earlier this month, HDFC Bank said it would hire about 300 at its new back office. The company has booked 38,000 sq ft at Ambuja Realtys IT complex Ecospace. German firm Thyssenkrupp, Australian animation company e-Magination and Acclaris have also booked space there.        
	Das was fearing a fall in hirings. In January, he said the hiring would be lower by 5,000 in this fiscal. This is much less than the target of the government.        
	MSR plans to set up an additional software delivery facility at Rajarhat by the end of 2010, managing director Mita Chakraborty said. It has already got land for the unit.         
	We have started work on the plot and the required 35,000 sq ft office space will be ready for operations by the end of 2010, Chakraborty said.         
	The data centre is MSRs third in the city. It will be supplemented by a network operation centre, which will provide technical support to clients.         
	The data centre will require about 40 professionals. All will be fresh recruitments, Chakraborty said.

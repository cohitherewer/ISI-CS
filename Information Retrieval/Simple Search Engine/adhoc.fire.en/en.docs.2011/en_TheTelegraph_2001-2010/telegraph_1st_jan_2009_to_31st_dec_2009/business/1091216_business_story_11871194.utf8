          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Locking horns                                  
	Mumbai, Dec. 15: Indias premier bourses  the Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) and the National Stock Exchange (NSE)  are locked in a subtle game of one-upmanship.        
	On Tuesday, the BSE decided to advance its market opening by 10 minutes to 9:45 am from December 18. The bourse will close as usual at 3:30 pm.        
	Reports indicate that NSEs top brass will meet tomorrow and extend its market hours by 30 minutes or even an hour. If it does so, it will send BSE scrambling to match its market timings.        
	The move to extend market timings was kicked off by the NSE early this year  ostensibly to give market participants the opportunity to react to developments in the South East Asian and Far Eastern markets.         
	In mid-October, capital market watchdog Sebi permitted the bourses to extend trading hours by up to two and a half hours.         
	However, the NSE couldnt move ahead with its original plan as its members put up strong resistance to an extension of the trading hours on the ground that it wouldnt boost trading volumes significantly to warrant such a change.        
	In a survey conducted by the BSE last month, about 79 per cent of the market participants covered in the exercise were against extending market hours.        
	BSEs announcement on the change in timings on Tuesday said, The continuous trading session in both segments  equity and equity derivatives  will be from 9.45 am to 3.30 pm on all business days. There will be no change in timings of any other session in both the segments.         
	The BSE clarified that block deal window timings in the equity segment will still be from 9:55 am to 10:30 am. These are the timings for conducting block deals at present.         
	Market participants believe that advancing the market opening by 10 minutes is a mere tokenism and is unlikely to have a major impact on trade.         
	Opening the markets at 9:45 am will, however, allow an overlap with the Hong Kong and Singapore pre-lunch session.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Goldman tipped to advise Satyam
                                                                                                               Goldman tipped to advise Satyam
          OUR BUREAU                       Way ahead                          
	Mumbai/Hyderabad Jan. 22: The six-member board of Satyam Computer Services has made up its mind to appoint Goldman Sachs as the adviser.         
	Sources said the board had zeroed in on Goldman whose mandate would be to restructure Satyam either by bringing in new investors or liquidating assets. Goldman did not comment on the development.         
	Reports about the board shortlisting Goldman and JPMorgan had been doing the rounds for some days.        
	After todays board meeting in Hyderabad, the company did not issue a statement. Attempts to reach board members Kiran Karnik and Tarun Das were unsuccessful.         
	The board will meet again tomorrow and an announcement is expected on a merchant banker.         
	This is the second meeting of the new board. The first was held last Saturday.        
	Key issues before the members include the appointment of a chief executive officer and a chief financial officer, on which some indications are likely tomorrow.         
	Earlier during the week, Deepak Parekh, who chaired the last meeting, had stressed on expediting funding arrangements and reassuring global clients.         
	Auditors KPMG and Deloitte have started the process of restating the accounts. Banks are hesitant to lend to Satyam before this is done.        
	Parekh, who is the chairman of HDFC, had said that Satyam would explore options such as mortgaging assets to raise funds from banks and encouraging customers to pay receivables in advance.         
	Tarun Das, the chief mentor of CII, had said the board would discuss on approaching the government for guarantees on loans.        
	Satyam is also mired in legal problems. The board has to contend with the class actions lawsuits in the US and the forgery charges by Upaid. However, priority will be given to the appointment of a CEO, CFO and an investment banker.         
	The board is discussing each issue threadbare and is in constant consultation with the office of the company law affairs ministry and also the PMO, said a spokesperson for Satyam.        
	The board is aware that 17 per cent of the Fortune 500 clients of Satyam have issued notices to terminate their contracts.        
	But we are still pursuing them through our overseas offices and are confident that we can convince them to do business with us, said the spokesperson.        
	LIC chairman T.S. Vijayan today said Satyam could be revived under right leadership. He also said the insurer, which is the largest shareholder along with L amp;T, was also open to selling its stake, depending on the price.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Fresh move to bring down sugar price
                                                                                                               Fresh move to bring down sugar price
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      Pawar: Hopeful                          
	New Delhi, July 31: The government today extended the duty-free import facility for raw sugar till March next year, while allowing the import of refined sugar at zero duty till November this year.        
	Both the incentives, which were earlier announced by the government to contain sugar prices, would have expired tomorrow.        
	The Centre also gave permission to private trade to import refined sugar at zero duty, which was so far restricted to public sector trading firms.        
	However, the 10-lakh-tonne quantitative restriction on import remains.         
	Announcing the decision to relax sugar imports in the Rajya Sabha today, agriculture minister Sharad Pawar said, With these decisions, the domestic availability of sugar will get augmented and prices in the country will remain reasonable.         
	Sugar prices have risen over 30 per cent since last October and are now trading between Rs 28 and Rs 35 a kg. Traders expect the price to move up during the festival season when the demand is likely to increase.        
	Analysts felt that domestic consumers were unlikely to benefit from the extension of the duty-free import incentive. Their logic is if India imports more it will only push up the prices of sugar futures in New York and London. This will obviously have an impact on domestic retail price.

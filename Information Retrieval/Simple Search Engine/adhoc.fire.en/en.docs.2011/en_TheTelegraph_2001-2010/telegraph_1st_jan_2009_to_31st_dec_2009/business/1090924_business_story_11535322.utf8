The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Hint of rule relief for Bharti-MTN deal
                                                                                                               Hint of rule relief for Bharti-MTN deal

	New Delhi, Sept. 23: Foreign firms, while buying into Indian firms, could be exempted from the provisions of the takeover code, if their intent is not to take control of the ownership or management of the local company, finance ministry officials said.        
	The Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) yesterday said that a foreign entity would have to make an open offer if its holdings in global depositary receipts or American depositary receipts  with attached voting rights  crossed the 15-per-cent threshold. Previously, the threshold for making an open offer for an additional 20 per cent stake applied to direct acquisition of shares.        
	The officials said Sebi could exercise its right to grant an exemption whenever a merger deal did not involve the foreign company taking control of the Indian entity.         
	For instance, in the Bharti-MTN case, if Bharti can make out a case that the control of the Indian arm will remain with existing promoters, an exemption can be theoretically considered, the officials said.        
	They said the rule on GDRs had been brought in as there were likely to be several cross-border deals involving GDR issues with attached voting rights.        
	Sources said that in the Bharti-MTN deal, regulators and finance ministry officials had learnt that there was a possibility of the GDRs coming with voting rights, necessitating yesterdays clarification.         
	Though Sebi is an independent authority, sources said the regulator had been in close touch with the finance ministry, and there had been discussions on how this route could be used in other cross-border deals, too.         
	The finance ministry remains supportive of the deal, and the regulator is expected to favourably respond to any requests for exemptions. However, legal issues have to be taken care of and not just for this Bharti-MTN deal but as a whole for all future M amp;A deals, said the officials. The airline industry is expected to see GDR issues soon, they added.        
	Under the deal structure, MTN of South Africa is scheduled to acquire a 25 per cent economic interest in Bharti Airtel. In addition, a few key shareholders of MTN are due to take up another 11 per cent through the issue of ADRs or GDRs. In turn, Bharti Airtel is supposed to acquire a 49 per cent stake in MTN.        
	The original deal structure is believed to have gone through some changes to soothe resentment among the shareholders of the South African company.

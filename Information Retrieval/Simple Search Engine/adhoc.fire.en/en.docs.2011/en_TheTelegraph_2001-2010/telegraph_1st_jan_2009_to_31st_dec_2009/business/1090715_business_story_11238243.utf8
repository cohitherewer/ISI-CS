The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Goldman profit surges 65%
                                                                                                               Goldman profit surges 65%
          GRAHAM BOWLEY                               
	New York, July 14: Goldman Sachs today reported second-quarter profits of $3.44 billion, a surge of 65 per cent.         
	The results continue a robust turnaround since the firm rode out the final months of 2008 with the help of a federal aid. They come just one month after it paid back its $10 billion in federal aid.        
	Goldmans profit was lifted by $6.8 billion record quarterly revenues in its fixed income, currency and commodities unit, where mortgage and other credit instruments are traded, the bank said. Its equity business also generated record net revenues.        
	While markets remain fragile and we recognise the challenges the broader economy faces, our second-quarter results reflected the combination of improving financial market conditions and a deep and diverse client franchise, Lloyd C. Blankfein, Goldmans chief executive, said. Goldman was humbled along with the rest of Wall Street last year when the financial markets froze, resulting in the loss of money in the final quarter of 2008, a rarity for the bank.         
	Since then, it has rebounded strongly, posting profits in the first quarter on the back of trading revenues and again in the latest quarter.        
	Many analysts are likely to welcome the news as a sign that the financial industry is stabilising. The Goldman results will probably set a positive tone for a slew of other bank results expected in the coming week.         
	However, they are also raising questions about how Goldmans rapid return would be perceived by lawmakers and taxpayers who helped it with a multi-billion dollar cushion last fall.

          OUR BUREAU                              
	Mumbai, Jan. 9: The Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (ICAI) is preparing to send a show cause notice to Price Waterhouse, the auditors of Satyam Computer Services, late tonight or tomorrow morning.        
	By tomorrow, we will issue the show cause notice to Price Waterhouse asking them for their comments on the entire Satyam episode. The notice will also tell the audit firm to identify the persons who they think should be held accountable, said ICAI president Ved Jain.        
	Commenting on the procedure that the ICAI will follow in the Satyam fiasco, Jain said, We are collecting material such as balance sheets and quarterly reviews of the company. We will await the reply from Price Waterhouse and then the director of the ICAIs disciplinary committee will assess whether the reply is satisfactory.        
	The ICAI is a quasi court and the usual principles of confidentiality that auditors usually cite will not apply to the institute.        
	The eight-member investigative team sent by the ministry of corporate affairs has seized all documents from the premises of the software firm in Hyderabad.        
	After obtaining a judicial order from the magistrate in Hyderabad, the Registrar of Companies, in coordination with Sebi, went to the office of Satyam and seized the documents from its premises, said Prem Chand Gupta, corporate affairs minister.

                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      ABG exits Great Offshore
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                            
	Mumbai, Dec. 2: ABG Shipyard today dropped out of the bidding war for Great Offshore after selling its 8.27 per cent stake in the Rs 950-crore integrated offshore oilfield services provider.        
	The announcement left Bharati Shipyard as the winner after a six-month long, bitterly contested ownership battle for Great Offshore.         
	ABG sold off its entire holding of 3,078,000 shares on Wednesday. It sold one million shares to Edelweiss Finance amp; Investments, another 1.07 million shares to ECL Finance and 250,000 shares to Carmona Investment amp; Finance.        
	It sold its 8.27 per cent stake in Great Offshore at an average price of Rs 570 per share.        
	ABGs exit was announced soon after Natural Power Ventures and Bharati Shipyard upped the ante with an open offer price of Rs 590 per share for a 20 per cent stake in Great Offshore.        
	The details of Bharatis open offer will be announced on Thursday.        
	Market watchers said ABG Shipyard wasnt entirely a loser: it had made at least Rs 50 crore as a result of the sharp vault in Great Offshores share price.        
	ABG had entered the battle on June 23 soon after it picked up a 2.02 per cent stake of the diluted share capital of Great Offshore for Rs 375 per share.        
	Bharati Shipyard makes vessels, while Great Offshore is an integrated offshore oilfield services provider that offers services to upstream oil and gas producers.        
	The Bharati Shipyard scrip was up 10.59 per cent at Rs 177.60 and ABG Shipyard closed higher by 9.43 per cent at Rs 206.50 on Wednesday.         
	Great Offshore, however, fell nearly 6 per cent after ABG chose to walk away from the bidding war.        
	Bharati Shipyard, which holds a 23.2 per cent stake in Great Offshore, was not available for comment as it was in the silent period during the open offer.         
	There are a lot of unanswered questions surrounding the deal. The procedural formalities of ABG Shipyard backing out of the open offer are not clear.         
	A certain section of analysts are also referring to the winners curse as they think Bharati Shipyard may have overpaid for the deal, especially after its announcement yesterday to raise the open offer price to Rs 590 per share.         
	Bitter battle        
	The takeover battle began in earnest in June when ABG Shipyard offered to pay Rs 375 per share for a 32.12 per cent stake in Great Offshore. It thus outbid Bharati Shipyards open offer in early June to purchase a 20 per cent stake at Rs 344 per share.        
	Great Offshore became a takeover target after former vice-chairman Vijay Sheth asked Bharati Shipyard for a loan of Rs 240 crore to repay the amount owed to two financial institutions.         
	In exchange, he had pledged a 14.89 per cent stake in Great Offshore. Sheth was unable to repay the loan and Bharati decided in May to invoke the pledge and acquired the shares at Rs 315 per share.        
	In June, Bharati Shipyard had raised its holding in the company to 19.47 per cent after picking up a 4.58 per cent stake through a block deal at a price of Rs 403 per share.

	Calcutta, May 17: Emami group company Emami Biotech is planning to roll out mobile units for selling bio-diesel in the city.        
	The company has applied for approvals from various authorities, Emami group director Aditya V. Agarwal said on the sidelines of an event organised by the Association of Corporate Advisers amp; Executives (ACAE) in Calcutta today.        
	It will take about a month to roll out the first phase of the mobile dispensing units in the city after we get the approvals, Agarwal said. Emami initially plans to launch two to three units and depending on the feedback, the number will go up.        
	Mobile bio-diesel units is the first of its kind in the country, Agarwal said. The mobile units will have tankers with meters and dispensers.         
	They can go and supply biofuel directly to the end users, he said.        
	Emami, one of the major bio-diesel makers in the country, has been finding it difficult to get buyers for the alternative fuel.

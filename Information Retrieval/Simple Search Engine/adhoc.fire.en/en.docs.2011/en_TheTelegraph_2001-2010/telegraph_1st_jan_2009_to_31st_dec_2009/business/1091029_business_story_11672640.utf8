The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Usha Martin to lower debt
                                                                                                               Usha Martin to lower debt
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Calcutta, Oct. 28: Usha Martin, one of the leading wire rope manufacturers globally, may raise equity to deleverage its balance sheet.        
	The company has about Rs 1,600-crore net debt and its debt-equity ratio stands at 1.61:1. Usha Martin may raise some equity to reduce its debt, most likely in the fourth quarter of this fiscal, after the Rs 2,100-crore expansion project is complete.         
	Rajeev Jhawar, a promoter and the managing director of Usha Martin, said no decision had been taken on any fund-raising plan. There is no immediate need. But if the company finds it suitable, we may look at raising money for future growth, he said.        
	The plan to expand the capacity of speciality steel to 600,000 tonnes from 350,000 tonnes as well as ramping up power and mining facilities is being funded through a mix of Rs 1,400-crore debt, Rs 700-crore equity and internal accrual. The company had last raised funds about four years ago. Once the new facility takes off, Usha Martin is expecting a turnover of Rs 1,000 crore on the basis of current prices.         
	On a consolidated basis, Usha Martins net sales were Rs 669.98 crore in the second quarter of 2009-10, a decline of 17 per cent from Rs 806.36 crore in the corresponding period of the previous year. Profit after tax declined to Rs 32.53 crore, down 37.9 per cent from the year-ago period.

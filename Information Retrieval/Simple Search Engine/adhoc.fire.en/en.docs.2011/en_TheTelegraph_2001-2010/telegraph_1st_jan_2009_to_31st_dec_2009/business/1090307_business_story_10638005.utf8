The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Jindals defer Bengal unit by a year
                                                                                                               Jindals defer Bengal unit by a year
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          JSW Steel vice-chairman Sajjan Jindal (left) with Assocham secretary-general D.S. Rawat in New Delhi on Friday. (PTI)                                  
	Calcutta, March 6: The Jindals have decided to put off construction work at Salboni in West Midnapore by a year.        
	The group has, however, decided to start producing steel as soon as the unit goes on stream. Earlier the project was scheduled to come up in phases.        
	The foundation stone for JSW Bengals 10-million-tonne steel plant at Salboni was laid by Bengal chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee in early November. The company had then said that it would set up an iron beneficiation plant, build a pellet unit and develop coal mines in the first phase to ensure a steady supply of raw materials. Work on the steel plant, which will produce semi-finished product slabs, was to start later.        
	Earlier, we had thought of keeping a gap of one year between the two processes. Now, we will do both together as there is not much market for pellet, Biswadip Gupta, CEO of JSW Bengal, said. Guptas remark came hours after JSW Steel vice-chairman Sajjan Jindal said in Delhi that the Bengal project would be delayed.        
	The construction work on the Bengal project has been deferred by a year. We hope things to improve by that time, Jindal told reporters at an Assocham conference today.        
	JSW Steel was to start construction on the Rs 35,000-crore project in November 2008. However, in February, Jindal had said that a slackening demand and difficult conditions in the global market were affecting the Bengal plan. Banks and financial institutions had told the company to first stabilise the Bellary plant in Karnataka before embarking on new projects.        
	The lenders have also asked the promoters to stump up more cash than standard industry practice, creating further pressure on the company struggling to generate funds in a sluggish market. We hope to complete the first 3-million-tonne steel plant within 36 months from the start of construction, Gupta said.         
	The company had earlier scaled down the size of the steel unit to 3mt from 6mt in the first phase. It had planned to invest Rs 4,000 crore in the beneficiation and pellet units along with the development of two deep-pit coal blocks in the first phase, followed by the steel unit for Rs 6,000 crore. Gupta said the company would now spend Rs 10,000 crore at one go in the first phase.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Hotel hiccup in ITC numbers
                                                                                                               Hotel hiccup in ITC numbers
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      BEATING BLUES                                
	Calcutta, Jan. 19: ITC has posted a 10 per cent increase in net income and an 8.8 per cent rise in net profit during October-December 2008, despite its hotel division not performing well.        
	Revenue from hotels dropped 14 per cent, while profit fell 33.8 per cent during the quarter under review. Economic slowdown and the Mumbai terror attacks have impacted occupancies and average room rates. The situation was particularly bad in December.        
	ITCs net profit increased to Rs 903.21 crore during the quarter from Rs 830.72 crore a year ago, while net income went up to Rs 3,858.65 crore from Rs 3,506.38 crore.        
	In cigarettes, profit before tax rose 18 per cent, while net turnover increased 17.72 per cent. Though ITC has diversified into other areas, cigarette constitutes 85.21 per cent of its pre-tax profit. Turnover in the farm business fell 6 per cent because of lower soya volume, but profit before tax rose 80 per cent on the back of better rationalisation of product portfolio.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                           BIG LEAP                                  
	Mumbai, Nov. 29: The Bank of Maharashtra is ramping up its presence in other parts of the country.        
	The PSU bank is planning to increase its branches to over 1,500 by the end of this fiscal from 1,437.         
	Most of these branches will be opened in states other than Maharashtra.         
	The bank is eyeing robust business in the current fiscal.         
	Chairman and managing director Allen C A Pereira said the banks business (deposits plus advances) would cross Rs 1,00,000 crore in the current fiscal from Rs 87,072 crore in March 31, 2009.         
	The bank expects strong deposit growth on the back of more branches. On the asset side, it hopes that micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs), retail borrowers and the farm segment will contribute to the higher business target.         
	The Bank of Maharashtra is in the process of setting up dedicated branches to serve MSMEs in addition to specialised retail credit hubs.         
	The MSME branches are proposed to be increased to 50 from 14.         
	It will have three retail credit hubs focused on housing, auto and education loans in Pune, Mumbai and Delhi. More such hubs are on the anvil over the next few years.         
	Pereira said the bank would set up specialised asset recovery branches to recover bad loans that rose during the second quarter ended September 30.         
	During the period, gross non-performing assets (NPAs) of the bank increased to Rs 1,223 crore from Rs 745.20 crore in the same period last year.         
	By the end of this fiscal, the bank expects to bring down gross NPAs to Rs 900 crore.         
	The three asset recovery branches will come up in Aurangabad and Nagpur in Maharashtra and in Calcutta.         
	We certainly want to be a pan-India bank. We are present in 22 states and two Union territories. The new branches, will be not only in the states where we do not have much presence, but also in under-banked areas, Pereira said.         
	Nearly 66 per cent of the banks business come from Maharashtra.         
	Pereira said the share of the other states would go up in the coming months.         
	He said 75 branches would be opened over the next few months, with five in the Northeast. This will include three branches in Assam and one each in Arunachal Pradesh and Meghalaya.         
	In Gujarat and Rajasthan, the bank is planning to set up 15 and 8 branches, respectively.

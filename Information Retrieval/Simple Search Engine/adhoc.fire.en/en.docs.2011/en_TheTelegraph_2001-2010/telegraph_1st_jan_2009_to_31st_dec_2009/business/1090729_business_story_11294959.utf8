The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Twin targets of Anil attack
                                                                                                               Twin targets of Anil attack
                              RNRL chairman Anil Ambani in Mumbai on Tuesday. (PTI)                            
	The following are excerpts from Anil Ambanis speech to the shareholders of RNRL at the 9th annual general meeting in Mumbai today.         
	On the role of RIL         
	RIL has tried every trick in the book  and apparently several outside the book  to back out of its solemn, legal and contractual obligations.         
	Government role        
	The role of the government is to approve the valuation of gas for the purpose of determining its take. The government does not fix the price of gas; (that is what) it told Parliament. The government-approved price is not the sale price. It is the price at which the government values its own takelike stamp duty; its just a reference price.         
	Bogey of ownership         
	Facts are deliberately being twisted to suggest that the corporate agreement between RIL and RNRL amounts to a private division of sovereign national assets. This bogey of sovereign ownership is being raised with the sole purpose of attempting to bail out RIL and help them renege on their contractual commitments.         
	Take it back        
	If the petroleum ministry is genuinely aggrieved  and if they honestly believe that RIL has violated the terms of the production sharing contract (PSC) by allegedly trying to divide national property  why dont they exercise their powers and terminate the PSC, and take back the ownership of the gasfields from RIL, when the provisions exist for them to do so?         
	Claim to gas         
	We are not claiming any rights to the ownership of the KG basin gasfields. We are claiming gas only from RILs lawful share or its rightful entitlement of production of gas under the PSC... our claim is entirely in line with the governments own stand on the floor of Parliament, not once or twice, but on at least 15 different occasions in the past three years.         
	Price punch        
	The price of $2.34 was not decided by two brothers on the dinner table. Nor is it part of some private family arrangement. The price was approved by RILs board of directors, nearly five years ago, and has been duly recorded in the commercial agreements signed by RIL.         
	India now has among the highest short-term gas prices in the world. In our view, it would be against public interest to price gas in India for any user above $1.50.         
	Who really benefits?         
	If RIL gets a higher sale price from us based on the price the petroleum ministry wants to fix for the first few years, 99 per cent of all revenues and profits will go to RIL, and only a measly 1 per cent will accrue to the government! Of the initial revenue of Rs 50,000 crore, RIL gets almost all, i.e. Rs 49,500 crore versus the governments Rs 500 crore. Makes you wonder why the ministry is pushing so hard for higher prices, when 99 per cent gains will go to RIL! At $2.24 (per mBtu), RIL makes a profit of over 100 per cent of its production cost, which translates to Rs 30,000 crore just from RNRL and NTPC.         
	Petroleum ministry        
	It is evident that the apparently biased stance (of the petroleum ministry) commenced in 2006, coinciding with changes in the ministry ...the ministry is aiming to re-write the PSC after nearly 10 years, and also seeking to cancel a contract between third party corporate entities! What then is the sanctity of a contract, which is the fundamental cornerstone of any law-abiding, market-driven economy?         
	The ministrys unfortunate intervention in a corporate commercial dispute  will erode investor confidence, and thwart the governments efforts to attract investments into India.         
	Cost of exploration         
	RIL claims to have spent Rs 45,000 crore on the KG-D6 basin. This was cleared by a management committee of four individuals  one junior official each from the petroleum ministry and the DGH and two representatives of the contractor. The budgeted expenditure for 40 MMSCMD was only Rs 12,000 crore in 2004. It would not have exceeded Rs 20,000 croreThis was gold-plating of costs.         
	Loss of trust         
	The most important word for Dhirubhai Ambani was trust and, unfortunately, that word has gone missing. RIL has shown no desire to comply with the directions of Bombay High Court.         
	Emotions surrounding dispute         
	There is no ego. There is only pain, hurt and emotion driven by a desire for fairness and justice.

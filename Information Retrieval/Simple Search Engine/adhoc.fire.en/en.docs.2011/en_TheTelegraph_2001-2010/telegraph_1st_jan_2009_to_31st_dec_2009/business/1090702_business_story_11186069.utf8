          G.S. RADHAKRISHNA                          On track                                  
	Hyderabad, July 1: Anil Ambani has emerged as a likely saviour of the Hyderabad metro rail project, which got derailed by the Satyam scam.        
	Ambanis Reliance Infrastructure may pick up an 84 per cent stake in Hyderabad Metro Rail Corporation, with Maytas Infra holding the rest.        
	Maytas chairman K. Ramalingam met Andhra Pradesh chief minister Y.S. Rajasekhar Reddy yesterday and submitted the Reliance proposal, hours before a state government deadline to Maytas to achieve a financial closure for the project.        
	A consortium led by Maytas Infra  a company promoted by the kin of Satyam Computer founder B. Ramalinga Raju, who is now in jail  had won the bid to build the Rs 12,000-crore metro rail project, but doubts arose as to its ability to complete the project in the wake of the Satyam scam.        
	K. Ramalingam had suggested two other partners for the project to Reddy  Malaysias Magna Allmore, an investment firm, and Germanys Siemens. However, Reddy rejected both the names.        
	The Andhra chief minister is yet to take a call on Reliance Infra.        
	However, Ramalingam is optimistic about Maytas joining hands with the Anil firm to complete the project on schedule by 2014.         
	Sources close to Reddy said Ramalingam sought one more month to finalise the deal with Reliance and come back with a financial package.         
	The chief minister is understood to have sought a letter from Reliance Infra on its game plan.        
	A spokesperson for Reliance Infra refused to comment.         
	However, sources within the company said talks with Maytas Infra had picked up pace over the last few days.

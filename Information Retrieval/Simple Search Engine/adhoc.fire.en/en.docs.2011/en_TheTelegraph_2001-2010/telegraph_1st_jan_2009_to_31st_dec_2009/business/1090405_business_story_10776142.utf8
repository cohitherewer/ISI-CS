The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Satyam board extends bid deadline
                                                                                                               Satyam board extends bid deadline
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Parekh: Action time                                  
	Mumbai, April 4: Satyam Computer Services has extended the deadline for submitting bids for the software services firm to April 13 as suitors have sought more data.         
	According to the earlier deadline, the bids were to be submitted by April 9.        
	The company expects to announce the name of the winner on the same evening, Deepak Parekh, member of the government-appointed board, said.        
	We met bidders yesterday and they requested for an extension of the date. They wanted more information about the company and hence the extension, Parekh said.        
	The board will be giving them the information today or tomorrow, Parekh said, adding that the name of the winner will be announced by April 13.        
	The additional data sought by the bidders will be put up on the companys website, Parekh said.        
	The software firm, languishing since its chairman Ramalinga Raju quit earlier this year after revealing an accounting fraud, is trying to find a buyer to take a 51 per cent stake in the company through a bidding process.        
	On Thursday, Satyam said it had tweaked the bidding process to introduce a second-round open auction to find a new owner if necessary.        
	The Satyam board met potential bidders yesterday. The meeting was attended by A.S. Murty, the companys chief executive officer, and investment bankers Goldman Sachs and Avendus.        
	While the names of all the bidders have not been disclosed, engineering major Larsen amp; Toubro and Tech Mahindra are believed to be the frontrunners.         
	The other names include IBM, Kohlberg Kravis Roberts and WL Ross amp; Co.         
	It is understood that the Satyam board along with Justice S.P. Bharucha, who is overseeing the bidding process, will open the sealed bids of the shortlisted aspirants on April 13.        
	Satyam has said the financial bids will be ranked based on the price only.        
	If there is no bid which is at least 90 per cent of the highest one, then the highest bidder will be declared the winner. If one or more financial bids are at least 90 per cent of the highest offer, the board will treat the highest one as the floor price and conduct an open auction by asking the highest bidder and those whose bids are at least 90 per cent of the highest bid to raise their offer.        
	If none of the bidders raise their financial bids after the open auction, then the highest sealed bid received will be declared the winner.

                                                                                                               Govt picks final two for Satyam
          OUR BUREAU                              
	New Delhi, July 17: The government today decided to retain C. Achuthan and T.N. Manoharan on the board of Mahindra Satyam after the Company Law Board allowed it to withdraw four of its nominee directors, according to an official statement.        
	Achuthan is a former member of Sebi, and Manoharan is a former chairman of the ICAI.        
	The government had superseded the Satyam board by appointing six directors after the accounting fraud in the infotech firm came to the fore in January.        
	The four directors to exit the Satyam board are former Nasscom chief Kiran Karnik, HDFC chairman Deepak Parekh, CII chief mentor Tarun Das and LICs executive director S.B. Mainak.        
	The remaining two directors will continue on board for three years and will not be counted in the maximum number of directors that the company can have, according to its articles, CLB chairman S. Balasubramanian said.         
	As long as the two directors remain on the board, any decision on the share purchase agreement could be taken only in the presence of at least one of them, said the CLB order.

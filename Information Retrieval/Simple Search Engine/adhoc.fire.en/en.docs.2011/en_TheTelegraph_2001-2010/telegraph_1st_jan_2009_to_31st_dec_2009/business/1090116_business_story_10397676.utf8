	New Delhi, Jan. 15: Hyundai Motor India Ltd today said it might go back to producing in three shifts by the second half of this year. The Indian arm of the Korean firm today launched an upgraded version of the premium Sonata         
	We hope to come back to our three-shift production as soon as possible. After the end of the first quarter we will have a clearer picture. May be (three-shift) production resumes in the second half of this year, said H.S. Lheem, managing director, Hyundai Motor India.        
	Last month, Hyundai had moved to two shifts from three at its Chennai facility in the face of falling demand.         
	However, strong retail sales in December have prompted a rethink.         
	In December, we had retail sales of 32,000 units and that helped in clearing all our dealer inventories. The market, however, continues to be tough, Lheem said.        
	Export orders for January and February are nearly half of their expectations because of the lower bookings in Europe.        
	In 2008, the company exported 13,399 units in January and 14,401 in February, which included the Santro, i10, Getz and Accent.         
	Lheem said the company was exploring new markets.        
	Australia, New Zealand and Saudi Arabia are the new markets that we are looking at. Also, I will be going to Mexico, Colombia and Chile to work out ways to increase volumes from these markets, he said.        
	Hyundai expected to sell 2.3 lakh units in the domestic market in this calendar year.        
	The premium sedan Sonata Transform launched today is priced between Rs 13.9 lakh and Rs 15.9 lakh as Hyundai looks to enhance its position in the premium car segment.        
	The 2.4-litre petrol version will cost Rs 13.9 lakh, while the two 2-litre diesel versions will cost Rs 14.89 lakh and Rs 15.9 lakh.

	New Delhi, Dec. 16: After JFE Steel Corp of Japan, its now Sumitomo Metals that has shown interest in the Bengal steel sector.         
	The third largest Japanese steel maker may buy a stake in Bhushan Steels proposed plant in the state.        
	Bhushan, which specialises in steel for vehicles, has offered Sumitomo a sizeable stake in its Bengal steel plant.        
	We are in talks to sell a 26-40 per cent stake in the proposed plant in Bengal to Sumitomo, which will also help us in part-funding the Rs 20,000-crore first phase of the project, Bhushan Steel managing director Neeraj Singal said.        
	We are positively considering joining the venture, a Sumitomo spokesperson confirmed from Tokyo.        
	Last month, JFE Steel expressed keenness to participate in Jindals steel project in Bengal.        
	Bhushan plans to set up a 3-million-tonne-per-annum (mtpa) steel mill in Asansol. The plant capacity may be later hiked to 6mtpa.         
	Singhal said a Sumitomo team had already visited Bengal. Sumitomo Metal has cutting-edge technology, which will help us in automobile steel.         
	Bhushan Steels shares rose 0.8 per cent to Rs 1,341.35 at the end of trading on the BSE. Bhushan and Sumitomo today also signed two pacts on marketing and sharing technical know-how.        
	The technical pact with Sumitomo will help Bhushan to manufacture more advanced automobile grade steel sheets at its Orissa plant. The sheets will be sold to the Indian arms of Toyota and Honda Motors, traditional customers of Sumitomo in Japan.         
	Bhushan Steel said it would increase its product prices by up to Rs 1,500 a tonne next month to cash in on the uptick in demand.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Jet sacks 43 trainees
                                                                                                               Jet sacks 43 trainees
                              Troubled times                            
	New Delhi, July 10 (PTI): Jet Airways today terminated the services of 43 trainee junior technicians on contract as part of its restructuring exercise in view of the challenges of the global financial downturn.        
	These personnel are on fixed term contracts and the notices have been issued in accordance to the terms of their contract and law, a Jet Airways spokesperson said.         
	She, however, said that some of them have been offered opportunities to work in other departments of the airline.         
	This trimming of the workforce has been necessitated by the ongoing rationalisation of airline operations, she said.         
	The global meltdown, which has badly affected the civil aviation sector, rising jet fuel prices and low passenger traffic have forced several global airlines, including Jet, to undertake various cost cutting measures.         
	Last year, Jet Airways had announced the termination of the services of 1,500 personnel but was forced to take them back after a public outcry.               
	Jet Airways has also reworked the delivery schedule of its fleet acquisition plan and curtailed services on several sectors, both domestic and international.         
	Kingfisher is also undertaking similar measures to stem rising losses.

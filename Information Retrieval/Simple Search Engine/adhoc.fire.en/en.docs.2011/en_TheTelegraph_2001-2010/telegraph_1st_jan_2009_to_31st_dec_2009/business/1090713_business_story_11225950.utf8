        Why is transferring ones pension account to a new branch so difficult, wonders Srikumar Bondyopadhyay                                            
	Hazel Dcruz, now a resident of Ahmedabad, and O.P. Batra of Delhi have a common problem  both of them faced immense difficulties and harassment in transferring their pension-cum-savings account to a branch closer home.         
	Dcruz is a railway pensioner (PPO No. WR/41818/489212) since 1996 and wanted to transfer her pension-cum-savings account from Kannur in Kerala (her work place before retirement) to Sabarmati, Ahmedabad in Gujarat.         
	Batra (PPO No. PAO/PC/373) wanted to shift his account from Janakpuri to Anand Vihar in Delhi.         
	However, it was only after several months of persuasion, financial hardship and mental agony that Dcruz and Batra got their pension payments from the new bank branches.         
	The reluctant attitude of bank officials and the red tape at government payment and account offices made the task so complicated.        
	Banks didnt have as many branches in the 1970s and 80s as they have now. Neither did they have core banking or automated teller machine facilities then. Thus people who retired some 30-35 years ago could not open their pension account in a bank branch closer home. The problem of pension account transfer is more critical for them, said Sunil Samanta of Calcutta, whose father is a retired government pensioner.        
	Its not simple        
	Transfer of a pension account from one bank branch to another is a cumbersome affair, which involves a number of bureaucratic processes.         
	According to the portal of the governments pension department, application for transfer of pensions may fall under the following three categories: (a) Transfer from one paying branch to another of the same authorised bank within the same station or at a different station;        
	(b) Transfer from one authorised bank to another within the same station (such transfers to be allowed only once in financial year); and        
	(c) Transfer from one authorised bank to another at a different station.        
	Requests falling under category (a) shall be entertained by the authorised bank itself. In case the transfer is at the same station, the link branch will make necessary entries in the register maintained by them and forward the disbursers portion of the pension payment order (PPO) to the paying branch (new).         
	In case the transfer is at a different station, the link branch, after keeping the requisite note, will forward the disbursers portion of the PPO to the link branch at the new station.         
	The Central Pension Accounting Office (CPAO) will be intimated about the transfer by the new as well as old link branches. The pensioner will also be told. The link branch on receipt of the pension documents will ensure it is forwarded to the paying branch within three days and intimate the pensioner simultaneously.         
	For cases falling under categories (b) and (c), the pensioner will have to apply for transfer of his/her account on plain paper and the old paying branch will send a letter duly signed by its branch manager to his counterpart in the new paying branch, along with a photocopy of the pensioners PPO showing the last payment made. This will be sent by speed-post/courier/registered post to the new paying branch, along with a copy each to the pensioner and the CPAO.         
	The pensioner should retain his copy of the pension payment order and produce it at the new paying branch. The new paying branch will start paying the pension immediately after receiving the letter of the last payment certificate.         
	Pension will be paid for three months on the basis of the photocopy of the pensioners PPO at the transferee (new) branch. During this time, it will be a joint responsibility of both transferer (old) and transferee (new) branches to ensure that all documents under the procedure are received by the transferee (new) branch within three months.        
	Except as stated above, the transfer of a pension from one payment point to another will not ordinarily be permitted.        
	Whatever the category, the transfer should be effected within three months.         
	However, before the commencement of pension, the pensioner has to be present at the paying branch for the purpose of identification. The paying branch shall obtain the specimen signature or the thumb/toe impression from the pensioner.        
	But a bank generally doesnt pay pension on the basis of the photocopy of the pensioners PPO on transfer of the account from one bank branch to another bank unless it receives an order from the CPAO, said Subrata Chakraborty, an official with a public sector bank.         
	But, a pension account transfer doesnt take more than a month if it is within the same bank and in the same station. A pensioner can draw his/her next months pension from the new branch. The transfer could take a couple of months if it is at a different station and to a different bank, he added.        
	Way out        
	However, pensioners can circumvent this cumbersome process of pension account transfer if they want to draw the money from a point closer to home.         
	According to the RBI, a pensioner is not required to open a separate pension account. The pension can be credited to his or her existing savings/current account maintained with a bank branch (authorised to pay pension) selected by the pensioner and this account can be jointly operated with spouse. Besides, standing instruction and cheque book facilities are also available with a pension cum savings account.         
	Now that bank accounts come with ATM cum debit card facility, a pensioner can withdraw money using his/her ATM card. So, you can withdraw your pension from any bank ATM located near your home without worrying about transferring the pension account to a bank branch near your home.

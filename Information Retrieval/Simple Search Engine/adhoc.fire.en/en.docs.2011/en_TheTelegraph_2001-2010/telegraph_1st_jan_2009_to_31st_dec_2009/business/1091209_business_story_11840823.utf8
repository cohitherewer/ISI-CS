The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Ranbaxy exits Japan venture
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Ranbaxy exits Japan venture
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Deal off                                  
	Mumbai, Dec. 8: Ranbaxy Laboratories Ltd has pulled out of Nihon Pharmaceutical Industry, its Japan-based joint venture company.        
	In September 2002, Ranbaxy, which is now a subsidiary of Daiichi Sankyo, and Nippon Chemiphar Company Ltd formed Nihon Pharmaceutical to market generic drugs.        
	In a statement today, Ranbaxy said it had sold its 50 per cent stake following an agreement between the two companies that allowed Nippon Chemiphar to purchase the entire shareholding of its partner.        
	Though Ranbaxy did not disclose the monetary value of the stake sale, it was learnt to be little over $16 million.        
	Following the transaction, Nihon Pharma will become a wholly owned subsidiary of Nippon Chemiphar.        
	In recent years, Ranbaxy said, both the companies had discussed the evolving generic market scenario and the emerging opportunities in Japan. It was amicably concluded that to create optimal value it would be in the best interest of both the companies to develop their generic businesses independently.        
	However, the existing generic products being manufactured and supplied from Ranbaxys manufacturing plants in India will continue to be supplied to Nippon Chemiphar, for some time, to enable a smooth transition.        
	Japan is the second largest pharma market in the world after the US. Ranbaxy has been targeting the market in the past few years.         
	Initially, its shareholding in Nihon Pharma was at 10 per cent. Ranbaxy later increased this to 50 per cent.        
	Nippon Chemiphar, founded in 1950, is a medium-sized Japanese pharmaceutical company, having its headquarters in Tokyo. Chemiphar has been developing, manufacturing and selling generics, in addition to proprietary products.        
	Shares of Ranbaxy closed at Rs 505.45 on the Bombay Stock Exchange, down 0.33 per cent from its previous close of Rs 507.10.

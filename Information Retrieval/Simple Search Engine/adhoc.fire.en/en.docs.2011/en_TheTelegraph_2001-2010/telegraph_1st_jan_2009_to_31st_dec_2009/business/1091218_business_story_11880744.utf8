The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Emami sows seeds of growth
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Emami sows seeds of growth
          SAMBIT SAHA                          Agarwal: Way ahead                                  
	Calcutta, Dec. 17: Emami will itself cultivate the inputs required for its wide range of personal care and health products.        
	As part of a vertical integration plan, the company has acquired over 6,500 acres in the country and is in the look out for more land, including in Bengal.        
	Emami chairman Radhey Shyam Agarwal said he was also trying to forge alliances with farmers in the UK and China for herbs and farm products.        
	We want to source our raw materials from a non-polluting environment by growing herbs and agri-products. We want to harvest organically without using any fertiliser or pesticides to enhance the richness and efficacy of our products, Agarwal said.        
	The company has acquired around 5,000 acres near Madurai in Tamil Nadu, 1,000 acres near Jhansi in Uttar Pradesh and 500 acres in Madhya Pradesh.         
	It has started cultivation in some of these tracts.        
	Apart from herbs, which go into the making of ayurvedic products, Emami is planning to produce menthol and camphor and grow amla.        
	We are not planning any new range but considering upgrading the existing product line. The transformation will kick off in a year or two, he said.        
	At present, the company sources products from farmers. While the farmers claim that they sow in a non-polluting environment, the company has hardly any control over the raw material source.        
	The situation will change when Emami starts cultivation directly  an exercise many Indian firms are keen on but few do.        
	In places such as China and the UK, the company will not enter cultivation directly but do contract farming.

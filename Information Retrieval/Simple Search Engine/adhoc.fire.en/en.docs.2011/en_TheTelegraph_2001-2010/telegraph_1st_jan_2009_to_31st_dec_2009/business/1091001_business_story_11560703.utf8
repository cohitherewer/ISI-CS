The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Taro slams Sun bid
                                                                                                               Taro slams Sun bid
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Drug duel                                  
	Mumbai, Sept. 30: Taro Pharmaceutical Industries of Israel has accused Dilip Shanghvi-owned Sun Pharmaceuticals of failing to make material disclosures in its open offer to acquire Taro shares from minority stakeholders.        
	In a suit filed at a federal court in Manhattan, the Israeli firm alleged that Sun Pharma had failed to provide information to Taro shareholders that US marshals had seized drugs produced by Caraco Pharmaceutical Laboratories at the behest of the US Food and Drug Administration. Caraco is the US arm of Sun Pharma and its major manufacturing and packaging operations in Michigan have been closed.         
	The revelation of these matters and Suns failure to disclose them in its current tender materials are the latest steps in a pattern of material misstatements and omissions by Sun in the inception and each step of its ongoing programme to acquire Taro, Taro alleged.        
	Taro, which is fighting a hostile takeover bid by Sun, said the latter had wrongfully exploited its highly confidential and proprietary business information to launch repeated competitive attacks on the sales of Taro products in the US. In their effort to take control of Taro, Sun and its affiliates have also misappropriated and misused confidential information of Taro which Sun obtained under a confidentiality agreement dated February 16, 2007, Taro said.         
	The Israeli firm said it had lost and was continuing to lose sales, customers and business opportunities as a result of Suns conduct.

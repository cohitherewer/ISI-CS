          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Anil Ambani in Mumbai on Tuesday. (PTI)                                  
	Mumbai, July 21: Reliance Capital  the Rs 5,976-crore financial services company owned by Anil Ambani  plans to list its life insurance business.        
	It could also induct a financial or strategic investor in the life insurance business  the only private player today without a foreign partner.        
	If Ambani goes ahead with a public offer for Reliance Life Insurance, it will be the first life insurance company to be listed on the bourses.        
	Reliance Capital is also planning to enter investment banking over the next 12 months to ramp up its presence in institutional broking and private equity.        
	Addressing the shareholders of Reliance Capital here today, Ambani said the life insurance business had grown rapidly over the past four years and ranked among the top four private life insurers in India.        
	We are considering various options to unlock this value from a potential IPO to strategic or financial stake sale, or even a combination of both  subject to necessary approvals. A final decision will be taken shortly, driven by the sole objective of maximising returns for our shareholders, he said.        
	This is not for the first time that Reliance Capital is looking to unlock shareholder value in one of its business lines. Back in 2007, Eton Park, a global investor, picked up a 5 per cent stake in Reliance Capital Asset Management for Rs 501 crore that valued the latter at Rs 10,000 crore.        
	Ambani revealed that Reliance Life Insurance recently crossed the milestone of three million policies in force. It is among the top three players in terms of the number of policies issued.        
	Despite the growth momentum witnessed by the industry over the past few years, the potential for expansion remains strong, thanks to low penetration levels, attractive demographics, robust economic prospects and increasing investor awareness. We are committed to growing our market share in this business, he said.

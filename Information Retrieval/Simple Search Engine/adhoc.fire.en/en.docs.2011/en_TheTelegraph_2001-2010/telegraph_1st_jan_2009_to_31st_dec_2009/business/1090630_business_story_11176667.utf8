The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Trai keen to tweak merger rules 
                                                                                                               Trai keen to tweak merger rules 
          JAYATI GHOSE                          J.S. Sarma Trai chairman                                  
	New Delhi, June 29: The Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai) is looking at ways to facilitate big-ticket mergers and acquisitions that the industry is likely to witness over the next two years.        
	The next couple of years will see consolidation. But how we should go about it is something that we have to decide, J.S. Sarma, chairman of Trai, told The Telegraph.        
	The department of telecom (DoT) is planning to tweak the rules for foreign investment and mergers, for which it needs to take the advice of Trai.        
	DoT officials said there were talks of raising the current FDI ceiling of 74 per cent and removing the three-year lock-in clause on the sale of promoter equity.        
	Trai had recommended a three-year cap on the sale of promoter equity to prevent the owners of companies that acquired telecom licences in early 2008 from making windfall profits. Mergers are imperative to spur growth and investment in the capital-intensive telecom sector, the Trai chief said.         
	Since 2005, 15 merger and acquisition (M amp;A) deals have been struck in India worth over $25 billion. If the merger talks between Africas MTN and Bharti Airtel succeed, the M amp;A market will near the $50-billion mark.        
	Industry analysts said 6-8 telecom companies would ultimately succeed in having a pan-India presence. A decline in the average revenue per user, gradual saturation of the market and a focus on high-value customers will accelerate the consolidation process.        
	At present, there are around 5-7 operators in each telecom circle, and the number is likely to increase to 15-18. The last 12-18 months have seen investments from global giants such as Russias Sistema, Bahrain Telecommunications, the UAEs Etisalat, Norways Telenor and Japans NTT DoCoMo.        
	Last year, Telenor bought 60 per cent in Unitech Wireless for about $1.07 billion, followed by a $2.7-billion investment by Japans NTT DoCoMo in Tata Teleservices for a 26 per cent stake. Next was Bahrain Telecommunications $225-million investment in Chennais S Tel, a new company which is yet to start services. Etisalat bought a 45 per cent stake in Mumbai-based Swan Telecom for $900 million in September 2008.        
	MTN official        
	The MTN group today said its finance director Rob Nisbet would be stepping down but would continue to be a part of the transaction team involved in the firms proposed $23-billion deal with Bharti Airtel.         
	Nisbet will be succeeded by Nazir Patel, effective from October 1.

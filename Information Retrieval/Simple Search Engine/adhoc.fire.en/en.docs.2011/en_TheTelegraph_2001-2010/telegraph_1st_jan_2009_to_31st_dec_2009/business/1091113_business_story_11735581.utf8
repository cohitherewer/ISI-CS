	New Delhi, Nov. 12: Industrial output grew 9.1 per cent in September compared with 4.8 per cent a year ago on the back of the governments strong stimulus measures.        
	Septembers good show came on top of a 10.4 per cent growth in August. This number is confirmation of a solid India story as far as consumer demand is concerned, said Sonal Varma, economist with Nomura Securities.         
	The strong showing could reopen a policy debate on how fast stimulus measures, which include tax cuts and lowering of interest rates, should be wound down.        
	With a burgeoning fiscal deficit of over Rs 4 lakh crore and rising food inflation, which rose to 13.68 per cent for the week ended October 31, from 13.39 the week before, many policy makers have been pushing for the winding down of stimulus measures.         
	If inflationary pressures develop, monetary authorities may take measures earlier (than January next year). The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) will wait and see how the price situation develops in the next two months, C. Rangarajan, chairman of the Economic Advisory Council to the Prime Minister, said yesterday.        
	However, others, including finance minister Pranab Mukherjee, have said that though domestic industry has been recovering, the global economy is yet to recover and the stimulus measures may be required for some more time.         
	There is a need to generate strong domestic demand till robust recovery takes place all over the world, particularly in developed economies, Mukherjee had said earlier this week.        
	Manufacturing growth had dipped 0.2 per cent in December last year. An atmosphere of uncertainty because of job and salary cuts had seen consumers staying away from big ticket purchases.         
	However, three stimulus packages since December 2008, involving a total tax giveaway of Rs 40,000 crore, saw the economy rebounding and customers coming back to the market.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Essar upbeat on Raniganj
                                                                                                               Essar upbeat on Raniganj
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          SET FOR THE DRILL                                  
	Mumbai, Sept. 9: Essar Oil expects to spend $300 million (over Rs 1,450 crore) over the next four years to extract natural gas from a coal block in Raniganj, approximately 150 km from Calcutta.        
	By December, we plan to begin production. We have already finished drilling 15 wells and plan to drill 500 wells in the area. Our peak investment will be $150 million and the balance will be raised from commercial banks, Shishir Agarwal, chief executive officer of Essar Exploration amp; Production India Ltd, told The Telegraph.        
	Essar Oil expects to produce 3 million cubic metres a day (mcmd) of gas by 2012.         
	Agarwal expects a healthy demand for gas in the region. We see a huge demand for natural gas as several industries are setting up plants  fertiliser, power and steel  in the stretch between Durgapur and Calcutta. He, however, refused to elaborate which plants he saw as potential customers.         
	According to a press release issued by the company, two major steel plants of SAIL, three existing and one upcoming power plant, besides other industries, will increase demand for gas in the area. The release also stated the total projected demand for the gas within a 150km radius (of the block) is projected at around 18 mcmd for 2010 and this number is expected to go up to 50 mcmd by 2017.        
	The company also plans to lay pipelines to transport the gas to industrial customers.         
	We will lay 25km of pipeline immediately and will talk to players like GAIL to extend the pipeline, said Agarwal.        
	The company has also approached the director-general of hydrocarbons (DGH) to fix a price for the output.         
	Greater Eastern Energy has fixed a price of $6.76 per million British thermal units (mBtu) and ONGC has priced gas at $6.5 per mBtu in the region. We expect our price to be in the same range, added Agarwal.        
	The DGH has upgraded its gas-in-place estimates from 42 billion cubic metres to 60.77 billion cubic metres for Essar Oils Raniganj coal bed methane block.

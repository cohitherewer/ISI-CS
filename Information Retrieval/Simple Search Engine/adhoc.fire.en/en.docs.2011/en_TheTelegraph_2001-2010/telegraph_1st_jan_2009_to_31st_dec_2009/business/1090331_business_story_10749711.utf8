          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                            
	Mumbai, March 30: The sensex stumbled once again, the rupee wobbled and bond yields surged as the markets went through another roller-coaster ride that was triggered by global developments.        
	The five-day, 1100-point rally on the stock markets last week snapped today on reports that Washington had ordered a change of guard at General Motors. The sensex swooned 480 points to close below 10000 at 9568.14. It was the biggest single-day fall in almost five months.        
	Asian indices opened weak and stayed in the red. A poor show by European indices exacerbated the fall. All key Asian indices finished lower with the Nikkei and the Hang Seng down 4.53 per cent and 4.70 per cent, respectively.        
	After opening lower at 9902.35, the sensex slipped to an intra-day low of 9520.96 and ended at 9568.14, a fall of 480.35 points or 4.78 per cent.        
	The BSE Bankex led the losers list with the index slipping 8.58 per cent on worries over the impact of rising yields of government securities. ICICI Bank plummeted 12.3 per cent to Rs 337.95, the SBI was lower 9.2 per cent and HDFC Bank was down 8.7 per cent.

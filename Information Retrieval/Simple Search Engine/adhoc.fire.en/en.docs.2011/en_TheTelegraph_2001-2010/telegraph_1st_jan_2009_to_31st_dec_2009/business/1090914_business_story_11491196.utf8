The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Bank at fault
                                                                                                                 Q amp;A      Bank at fault
                                I require about Rs 3 lakh from my PPF account maintained with the State Bank of India (a/c number 11005498689), Naktala Branch. I opened the account in 1987-88 and at the end of 2002-03 the balance in the account was Rs 19,34,639.24.               During this 15 years I didnt withdraw any money from the account. Then I extended the account for five years till 2007-08 and the balance at the end of the period stood at Rs 25,63,907.32.                   I renewed the account for another five years till 2012-13 and made a withdrawal of Rs 9,60,000 last year. When I approached the bank to withdraw Rs 3 lakh from the account, they said that I can withdraw only up to 60 per cent of the balance at the end of the first 15 years, that is, Rs 19,34,639.24. Since I have already withdrawn Rs 9,60,000, I cannot withdraw Rs 3 lakh now. Is the bank right?              Niranjan Das, Calcutta
                    If you are just maintaining the balance at the end of the first 15 years in the extended period, you can withdraw the entire sum in one or more installments, but only one withdrawal a year is permitted. If you are continuing with fresh subscriptions, you can withdraw up to 60 per cent of your balance at the commencement of each extended period in one or more installments, but not more than once a year. In either case, the bank is not right in preventing you from withdrawing Rs 3 lakh.                                  Wealth tax      I am over 63 years of age. I am planning to sell my house for Rs 8 lakh. Will this come under wealth tax? If so what is the rate of tax? Will my bank straightway deduct wealth tax from my account? What is the limit for wealth tax? I am a PAN card holder and my annual income is below Rs 1 lakh?        Sarbani Das, Bandel
                    A residential house comes under the wealth tax. However, if a residential house is let out on rent for a minimum of 300 days a year, it wont come under wealth tax. Similarly, cash in hand in excess of Rs 50,000 comes under the purview of wealth tax. In fact, if the total value of your assets, including jewellery, is more than Rs 15 lakh you will have to pay wealth tax at the rate of 1.5 per cent.

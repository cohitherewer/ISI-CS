	Calcutta, June 10: Insurance companies will have to disclose their valuations, based on the embedded value method, from the current financial year.         
	The Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority (IRDA) will come out with the guidelines to compute the embedded value, or the present value of future profits, in a couple of months.         
	Insurers will also have to disclose the assumptions behind their new business achieved profit, which is the future profit from businesses underwritten and a component in the calculation of embedded value.        
	The method of calculating the valuation of insurance firms is different from other businesses  including other financial products  as their revenues (for instance premiums and income from investments) and costs (such payment of claims) take place over a period of time and, therefore, have a large future component.        
	Addressing a seminar organised by the Indian Chamber of Commerce here today, IRDA chairman J. Hari Narayan said, We dont have a national standard for the calculation of embedded value or economic value. As a result most of the insurance companies that now state their embedded value owe the system of computation to their foreign partners in the joint venture.         
	The insurance regulator has put a cap on the remuneration of the CEOs of life insurance companies and is planning to cap charges in unit-linked insurance plans.

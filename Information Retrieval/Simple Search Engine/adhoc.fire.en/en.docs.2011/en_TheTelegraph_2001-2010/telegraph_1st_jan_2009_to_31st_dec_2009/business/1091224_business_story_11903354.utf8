          A STAFF REPORTER                          Khaitan: Growth plans                                  
	Calcutta, Dec. 23: Williamson Magor group company McLeod Russel Ltd today said its UK subsidiary Borelli Tea Holdings had signed an agreement with two UK entities  James Finlay Ltd and James Finlay International Ltd  to acquire a tea firm in Uganda.        
	Borelli will initially pay $25 million. Another $5 million will be paid to repay the debts of the Uganda firm, Rwenzori Tea Investments Ltd, McLeod Russel managing director Aditya Khaitan said here today.        
	The transaction is scheduled to be completed on January 15.        
	Borelli will fund the deal through a debt of $15 million, while McLeod will contribute about $10 million through internal accruals, Khaitan said.        
	During January-December 2008, Rwenzori reported a turnover of $24.5 million with a net profit of $5 million. The company is expected to post a profit of around $7 million and a turnover of $30 million in 2009, Khaitan said.        
	According to McLeod, the Uganda firm produces 15 million kg black tea annually. McLeod expects production of the newly acquired company to rise to 20 million kg in the next three years.        
	We are trying to offer value-added tea in the form of blends through this acquisition to our overseas buyers in Pakistan, Egypt and the UK, Khaitan said.         
	With the new acquisition, McLeods output would rise to 97 million kg. Of this, we aim to export 48 million kg, Khaitan said.        
	In August, Borelli had picked up a 75 per cent equity stake in US-based Olyana Holdings LLC for $2.75 million (about Rs 13 crore).         
	In 2008, McLeod had acquired Vietnam-based Phu Ben Tea Company for about $7 million through Borelli.

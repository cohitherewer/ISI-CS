	New Delhi, May 31: Beleaguered exporters have pencilled in meetings with finance minister Pranab Mukherjee and commerce minister Anand Sharma this week for sops such as interest subsidy, exemptions from income tax and service taxes, and support for access to special markets.        
	We are meeting the finance minister on June 2 and the commerce minister on June 3 to highlight the problems faced by the exporter community, A. Sakthivel, president of the Federation of Indian Export Organisations, said.        
	Exporters are passing through a difficult phase in view of the global slowdown. Recession has made buyers cost-sensitive and therefore price competitiveness has become a vexed issue for us. Exports can grow and achieve the $170-billion target this fiscal if the government provides necessary support in the budget, he said.         
	Exports fell last October for the first time in a decade and missed the target of $200 billion for 2008-09.         
	They grew a mere 3.4 per cent to $168.7 billion in the last fiscal from $163.1 billion in 2007-08.         
	In April, there are fears of exports going down by as much as 33 per cent.        
	Sakthivel said there were signs of a revival with orders increasing slowly, and the situation was likely to improve in the next quarter.         
	The government should take immediate steps to prevent the sector from sinking further. Appreciation of the rupee has meant more gloom for us, Sakthivel said.        
	Since October, the Reserve Bank of India has lowered the lending rate and the government has offered interest subsidies.        
	Mukherjee had said the government was considering more relief measures for sectors such as textiles, leather, gems and jewellery, and they could be announced in the budget.        
	We shall look at the possibilities for more incentives to exporters, commerce minister Anand Sharma had said.        
	He said he would discuss them with Mukherjee, and some could be announced in the budget, which might be tabled in early-July.        
	He said additional incentives, including the reduction in transaction costs, would be announced in the foreign trade policy 2009-14, which would be unveiled in August.

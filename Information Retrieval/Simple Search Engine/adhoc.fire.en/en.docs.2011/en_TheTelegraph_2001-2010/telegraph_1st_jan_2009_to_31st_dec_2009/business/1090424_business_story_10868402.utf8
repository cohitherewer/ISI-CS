	Mumbai, April 23: HDFC Bank, the countrys second largest private sector bank, today beat Street estimates by reporting a 33.9 per cent rise in net profit for the fourth quarter ended March 31, 2009. Net profit rose to Rs 630.88 crore from Rs 471.11 crore in the same quarter last year.        
	The bank earned a total income of Rs 5,365.5 crore against Rs 3,505.5 crore in the fourth quarter of 2007-08, an increase of 53.1 per cent.

	For the financial year ended March 2009, HDFC Bank reported a net profit of Rs 2,244.95 crore compared with Rs 1,590.18 crore a year ago. Total income rose to Rs 19,622.88 crore from Rs 12,398.15 crore in the last fiscal.

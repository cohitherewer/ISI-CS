	Mumbai, June 28: A worsening economic situation could lead to further job losses and even plant closures at Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) in Britain.         
	The Jaguar and Land Rover cars had been condemned in the downturn (but) they are terrific brands, said Tata group chairman Ratan Naval Tata at the launch of the marque brands in Mumbai on Sunday.         
	We have been in discussions with our workforce and the workers are very realistic. If the market dictates, future jobs and plant shutdowns cannot be ruled out, JLR chief executive David Smith said.         
	The Tatas are trying to persuade the British government to stand guarantee for loans that they plan to seek from the UK banks to bail out JLR.         
	We are in discussions with the UK government on guarantees for loans. We will find a solution, Tata said.         
	The British government has been reluctant to provide these loan guarantees.         
	Asked whether the group was open to the idea of offering a stake to the UK government, Tata said, If a large financial package is given to the company by the government, they should be given a commensurate level of representation. We are negotiating at present.         
	Last week, Tata Motors suffered its first consolidated full-year net loss in eight years of Rs 2,500 crore.         
	The loss was partially attributed to a slump in sales at JLR, which Tata Motors bought from Ford last year for $2.3 billion.         
	According to reports over 2,000 workers have been laid off at JLR as the luxury brands suffered in the downturn. Jaguar has shown a stronger sales performance and the XF model has carved out a market share in Europe, North America and Asia. Land Rover enjoyed record sales in 2007 and half of 2008, Smith said.         
	Land Rover will be launching an entire range of models, he said.         
	In India, Jaguar Land Rover has tied up with Tata Capital, ICICI Bank and HDFC for financing packages that include insurance cover.         
	The premium brands have already started sourcing components and accessing engineering services from Tata group companies.         
	JLR and the Tata group are also engaged in collaborative research in the UK.         
	Tata ruled out moves to merge JLR with Tata Motors saying that the latter has its own range.

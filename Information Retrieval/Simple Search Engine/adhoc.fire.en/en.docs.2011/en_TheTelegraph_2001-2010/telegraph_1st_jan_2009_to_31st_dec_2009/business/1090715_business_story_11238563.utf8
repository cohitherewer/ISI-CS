The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Cash comfort for core projects

	Mumbai, July 14: Infrastructure is back in favour. Global and local investors are raising money to invest in roads, ports and power projects in the country.        
	According to an estimate by Ernst amp; Young, around $2.5 billion is ready for investment in this sector.        
	The fact that IIFCL managed to raise Rs 7340 crore ($1.5 billion) in the beginning of the year is a positive sign. While three infrastructure funds  IDFC Project Equity; Macquaire, SBI and Standard Chartered; and ILFS Fund  declared their first close totalling $2.5 billion, three more global infrastructure funds intend to invest significant amounts here, said Jayesh Desai, national director (infrastructure) of Ernst amp; Young India.         
	There is a renewal of interest in infrastructure after the budget. Global investors feel that India will perform better, on-the-ground activity has improved and the government is keen on the sector, said Shahzaad Dalal, vice-chairman and managing director of IL amp;FS Investment Managers.         
	This year, so far, the scorecard has not been impressive. The sector saw transactions of $1.4 billion in the first half of this year compared with $5 billion in the same period last year (see table). That may change soon.         
	There are several transactions that are available in ports and roads as well as greenfield power projects, said Dalal.        
	In a recent report on infrastructure, Desai said the first quarter this year saw noticeable activity in the road sector with the NHAI floating bids for 37 projects. Of these, 22 projects with a total value of Rs 22,000 crore ($4.5 billion) are in the process of being awarded. This is encouraging, he said.        
	The Ernst amp; Young study of some construction businesses shows that government-related orders increased over 50 per cent in a period marked by slowdown.         
	Even as global infrastructure funds set their sights on the countrys roads and ports, the deal pace is just about picking up.         
	A lot of players still face liquidity challenges. Money has now started coming in selectively, said Dalal.        
	Ernst amp; Youngs partner Sushi Shyamal said large construction companies had burgeoning order books, but one of their key challenges was to raise adequate financing to fund the projects.         
	In the recent past, most construction companies have resorted to equity dilution in the primary markets to raise funds. Now they cannot raise money by selling equity without losing control.

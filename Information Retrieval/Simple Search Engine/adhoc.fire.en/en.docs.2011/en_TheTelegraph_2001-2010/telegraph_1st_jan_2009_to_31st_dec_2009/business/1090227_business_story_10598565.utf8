The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Ranbaxy, parent team up to fight US charge 
                                                                                                               Ranbaxy, parent team up to fight US charge 
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Feb. 26: Japanese drug maker Daiichi Sankyo, which has acquired Ranbaxy Labs, today said it had formed a joint team with Ranbaxy to look into the USFDAs charge that the Indian drug firm had falsified data and test results in its drug applications.        
	Daiichi Sankyo takes the issue very seriously, and both Daiichi Sankyo and Ranbaxy have already formed a team to solve this issue, it said in a posting on its website.        
	The US Food and Drug Administration (USFDA) has stopped reviews of drug applications from Ranbaxys Paonta Sahib plant after test results submitted for both approved and pending drug applications were found to be false.         
	The ban applies to about 25 approved drug applications that contain data from the plant, an official of the agency said.        
	The FDA said the affected applications from Ranbaxy were for drugs in three categories. These are approved drugs made at the Paonta Sahib site for the US market, drugs pending approval which are not yet marketed and certain drugs manufactured in the US which rely on data from the Indian facility.        
	Ranbaxy said the letter from the FDA indicated that all pending and approved abbreviated new drug applications from its facility had been added to the application integrity policy (AIP).         
	The AIP is invoked when a companys action raises questions about the integrity of data in drug applications.         
	Ranbaxy said it would cooperate with the FDA and that some of the applications were first-to-file applications, which could win 180 days of market exclusivity if approved. No effort or action will be spared to timely protect key generic drug applications from Paonta Sahib, the company said.        
	Shares of Ranbaxy fell 18 per cent on the BSE.

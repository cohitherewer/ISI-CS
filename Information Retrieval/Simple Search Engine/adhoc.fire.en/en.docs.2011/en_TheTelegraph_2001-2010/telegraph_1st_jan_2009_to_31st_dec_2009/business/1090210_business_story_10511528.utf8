          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Mumbai, Feb. 9: The promoters of several large companies, including Tata Steel, CESC, and Dr Reddys Laboratories, have admitted they pledged a part of their shares with lenders.        
	In Tata Steel, the promoters have pledged 13.53 per cent of the 34 per cent equity they hold in the countrys largest steel maker. In a filing with the bourses, the company said Tata Sons and Tata Investment Corporation had pledged 9.89 crore shares.        
	The Securities and Exchange Board of India recently asked companies to disclose how much of the promoters stock had been pledged against loans. The directive came after the Satyam scam when it emerged that Ramalinga Raju and his family had pledged their shares with lenders.        
	Although Tata Steel did not state the reasons behind these pledges, it disclosed that Tata Investment Corporation pledged nearly 25 lakh shares. These shares were pledged as security for the zero coupon convertible bonds (ZCCB) issued by Tata Investment Corporation. Tata Steel added that the ZCCBs carry no interest and are fully convertible into equity shares.        
	The pledge cannot be invoked as no payment obligations arise from the issue of the ZCCBs, it said without offering details on the 9,64,00,000 shares pledged by Tata Sons.        
	Maytas Infra  a company closely connected with the Satyam fraud  today said B. Ramalinga Raju, Nandini Raju and B. Rama Raju had pledged all the shares they held in their individual capacities. The shares amounted to 15.14 per cent of the companys equity.         
	The promoters of CESC have pledged only a small portion of their shareholding  5.75 per cent out of the 52.49 per cent they hold.        
	Dr Reddys Laboratories said its promoters had pledged 6.19 per cent of the total outstanding shares. The promoters hold 26.40 per cent.        
	G.V. Prasad, son-in-law of DRL founder chairman Anji Reddy and the present CEO, pledged around 6,16,504 shares while Dr Reddys Holdings had encumbered 9,775,009 shares.         
	Gujarat NRE Coke said five of its promoters had pledged 15.96 per cent for an undisclosed amount. Kamat Hotels India said its promoters had pledged 47.09 per cent in the company.

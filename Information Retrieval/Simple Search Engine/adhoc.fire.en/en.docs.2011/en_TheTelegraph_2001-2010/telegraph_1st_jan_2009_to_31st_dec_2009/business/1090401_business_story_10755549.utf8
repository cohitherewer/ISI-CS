The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Retailers pack up, go to towns to cut cost
                                                                                                               Retailers pack up, go to towns to cut cost
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                          Strategy shift                                  
	New Delhi, March 31: Faced with shrinking sales and falling footfalls, retail chains in the country are focusing on consolidation, moving to low-rent premises and offering discounts to combat the current slowdown.        
	Retailers are likely to focus on cost reduction by closing unprofitable stores, moving to tier II, tier III cities with low rentals, and offering heavy discounts on products to overcome the slowdown, KPMG said in an industry report released today.        
	While the Bharti Retail chain plans to close five of its 28 Easy Day supermarkets in north India, department store Shoppers Stop is set to close some of its airport shops and food outlets.        
	RPG Retail has also shut down 45-50 non-performing Spencers stores, some of which have been relocated.        
	To conserve resources, companies such as Vishal Retail have decided to centralise their operations. Vishal has already closed its large distribution centres in Mumbai and Calcutta and opened a centralised warehouse in Gurgaon, near Delhi.         
	Kishore Biyani-promoted Future Group has merged the back-office operations of its different stores to lower costs.         
	Our back-end operations have been converged to cater to multiple formats as part of our cost-cutting and efficiency enhancing exercise, said Rajan Malhotra, chief executive of Big Bazaar.         
	The group may also reduce the size of some Big Bazaar stores and even close a few.        
	Be it store rationalisation, change of supply chain, consolidation of operations, improvement in IT infrastructure, retailers need to think quick to protect their margins, said Neil Austin, global head of markets at KPMG.        
	KPMG expects the slowdown to last 12-18 months, with recovery depending on the governments efforts to stimulate the economy.         
	The organised retail sector has witnessed an 11 per cent decline in sales in 2008, the report added.

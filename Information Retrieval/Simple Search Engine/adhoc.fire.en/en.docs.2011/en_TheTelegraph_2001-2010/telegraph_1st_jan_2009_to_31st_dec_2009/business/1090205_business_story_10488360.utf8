The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Credit crunch hurts software export growth
                                                                                                               Credit crunch hurts software export growth

	New Delhi, Feb. 4: The target of software and BPO exports for this fiscal has been lowered by industry body Nasscom.        
	Exports are seen to grow 16-17 per cent to $47 billion, against an earlier estimate of 25-30 per cent growth at $50 billion.        
	Nasscom is attributing this to the global credit crunch and slowdown in banking, financial services and insurance businesses.         
	Software and BPO exports comprise over 90 per cent of the countrys IT revenues, which include earnings from the hardware business and domestic sales.         
	The US and the UK account for over 80 per cent of the revenues. The software business covers products, services, development as well as e-commerce.         
	In exports, the banking, financial services and insurance segment make up almost 40 per cent of the revenues. The credit crunch has spelt doom for many global financial institutions, which has hit Indian software firms.        
	Nasscom said software-BPO would see sustainable growth over the next two years and clock revenues of $60-62 billion by 2010-11. This figure, too, is a downward revision with revenues in 2009-10 seen at $60 billion.        
	We are hopeful that the government will stimulate investor confidence and growth by extending fiscal incentives to this industry and boost domestic IT spend, said Ganesh Natarajan, chairman of Nasscom.        
	Software and BPO firms have embarked on a strategy of geographical diversification, which means setting up centres across the world. Indian firms have over 400 delivery centres in 52 countries, which are expected to give them an edge over their global rivals.         
	At the employee level, the IT industry is focussing on further training of staff and greater high-end skills for them.         
	Overall, the industry will remain a net employer, Nasscom said.        
	It said the attrition rate was falling, and this should moderate wages in the next fiscal.        
	Delegation for US         
	A high-level team from Nasscom will be in the US next month to liaison with the new Obama administration, top politicians, think tanks and companies and convince them of the benefits of outsourcing.        
	Natarajan said the five-day visit would also focus on tax issues and immigration.

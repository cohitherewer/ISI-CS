The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Banks rush to cover flanks on credit card risks
                                                                                                               Banks rush to cover flanks on credit card risks

	Calcutta, Feb. 1: Surging debts on credit cards have forced banks to take protective measures.        
	This comes when the government is initiating steps to cut interest rates on bank loans and raise the flow of credit to consumers.        
	RBI data show outstanding loans on credit cards have swelled 73 per cent to Rs 29,359 crore at the end of December 2008 from Rs 16,951 crore at the end of November 2007.        
	According to the RBI, the number of credit cards of banks rose to 28.3 million in April last year from 23.5 million at the end of March 2007 only but fell to 25.3 million by the end of November 2008.         
	A decline in the number of outstanding credit cards suggests that either more and more people are voluntarily surrendering their cards to avoid a higher loan burden or an increased number of credit cards are being blocked by issuers in the wake of higher delinquencies, said a senior official of Calcuttas Uco Bank.         
	Monthly credit card payments shot up to Rs 6,442.34 crore in October last year from Rs 5,201.23 crore in October 2007 and Rs 4,258.26 crore in April 2007.        
	According to the Uco official, The sudden surge in credit card dues and advances against fixed deposits is because people, squeezed by higher interest and inflation rates for most part of the year (2008), have resorted to more borrowing to meet their expenses.         
	Interest rates on loans and inflation rose steeply till August 2008. While the higher rates increased the interest burden on existing loans, the double-digit inflation ate into disposable incomes.        
	To avoid higher defaults, banks have started reducing the cash withdrawal and credit limits on cards.         
	ICICI Bank, the largest card issuer with 18 million customers, had increased the interest rate to 3.4 per cent per month (49.3 per cent annually) from 3.15 per cent (45.09 per cent a year) in June.         
	An ICICI Bank official said it had revised the credit limit on cards in January to 1.5-2 times of monthly income from 2-3 times.         
	This measure aims at arresting the increasing delinquencies in credit card payments, the banker said. ICICI has also withdrawn the Xpress Rewards Programme.        
	Barclays has withdrawn the cash withdrawal facility for some of its customers. It recently sent text messages to its clients on the change. The cash withdrawal limit has been lowered for all card holders and for some it has been reduced to zero, said an executive at Barclaycard.         
	HSBC has gone a step further by slashing both the credit as well as cash withdrawal limits by half.        
	The general economic slowdown entails bleak potential for growth in income and employment. Amidst this condition, banks want to reduce their exposure to unsecured loans and the risk of defaults, said a banking analyst at Angel Broking, a securities brokerage house.         
	Credit card defaults, which were in the range of 7 to 9 per cent in 2006-07, increased to 10-12 per cent in 2007-08 and to above 15 per cent so far in the current financial year.         
	Credit card NPAs (non-performing assets) for SBI Cards amp; Payment Services Private Ltd, the joint venture between GE Money and the State Bank of India, have gone up to 16.5 per cent.        
	Over the 13 months ending December 2008, the outstanding amounts on all types of personal loans are up 16.4 per cent to Rs 5,68,474 crore from Rs 4,88,413 crore.        
	All this while the growth rate of the gross domestic product  a key indicator of economic health  is in the slow lane. From a high of 9 per cent in the last fiscal, it is expected to be around 7 per cent in 2008-09 because of the global financial crisis.        
	The loan burden is high on advances against fixed deposits, which have risen 27.5 per cent to Rs 50,055 crore in December 2008 from Rs 39,269 crore in November 2007.

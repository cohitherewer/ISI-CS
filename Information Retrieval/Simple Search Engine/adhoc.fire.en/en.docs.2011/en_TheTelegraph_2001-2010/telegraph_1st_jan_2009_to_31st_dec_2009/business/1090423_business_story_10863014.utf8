	New Delhi, April 22: HCL Technologies net profit fell 42 per cent to Rs 152.57 crore in the third quarter ended March 31, 2009 from Rs 263.08 crore a year ago.         
	Delhi-based HCL blamed the fall on foreign exchange losses. Its shares tanked 13 per cent on the BSE.         
	Total income of HCL Technologies, one of Indias top five software exporters, fell to Rs 1,048.90 crore for the quarter under review compared with Rs 1,275.58 crore in the same quarter of the previous fiscal.        
	However, for the nine-month ended March 31, the company reported a net profit of Rs 804.37 crore against Rs 794.19 crore in the same period a year ago, an increase of 1.28 per cent.        
	HCL hired 2,298 employees during the third quarter, taking its total headcount to 54,026. It has won deals worth over $1.5 billion (Rs 7,500 crore) in the last nine months.        
	In the third quarter, HCL bagged 11 contracts worth $250 million (Rs 1,250 crore) from customers such as UTI, Nasdaq OMX, Shoprite, Moduslink and Xerox.        
	HCLs results follow those of the countrys largest software exporters by revenue  Tata Consultancy Services and Infosys Technologies  both of whom gave a cautious outlook for the next financial year.        
	Software exporters earn most of their revenue from clients in the US and Europe and have been hurt by global customers cutting back on spending because of the recession. The HCL board has declared an interim dividend of Re 1 a piece for the March quarter.

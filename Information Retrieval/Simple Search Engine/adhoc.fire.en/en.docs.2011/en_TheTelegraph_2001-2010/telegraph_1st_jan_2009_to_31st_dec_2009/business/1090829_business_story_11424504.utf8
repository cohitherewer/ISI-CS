          OUR CORRESPONDENT                          Gupta: Fund fare                                  
	New Delhi, Aug. 28: Calcutta-based United Bank of India (UBI) today said it would raise up to Rs 500 crore by diluting 15 per cent of the governments equity through a public issue in January 2010.              
	The bank will file a draft red herring prospectus with Sebi in October after its accounts for the period ended September 30, 2009, are audited. We should be able to mobilise about Rs 450-500 crore of funds, Gupta said.         
	The state-run lender has got the RBIs approval for opening 123 branches this year. It has received Rs 250 crore from the government in the form of perpetual non-cumulative preference shares, and another Rs 550 crore is expected to come in the current financial year.         
	These, along with the IPO proceeds, will see us through till March 2011, if not 2012, said Gupta.        
	Earlier, the government had approved the capital restructuring of the bank, which would reduce the paid-up capital from Rs 1,532 crore to Rs 266 crore. This will enable the bank to get a better pricing for its IPO.

                                                                                                               Fillip for Electrosteel Jharkhand project
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Calcutta, Aug. 20: Electrosteel Integrated Ltd (EIL) has tied up debt worth Rs 5,447 crore for its 2.2-million-tonne integrated steel project in Jharkhand.        
	The State Bank of India is the principal lender in a consortium of 30 financial institutions, including Hudco and the LIC. It is also the facility agent of the consortium.         
	The development comes at a time when very few steel companies have managed to garner funds for new projects or expansion.        
	Ashutosh Agarwal, head of finance of EIL, said the project not only had land, iron ore and coking coal mines but had also tied up finances.         
	The plant will start operating from April 2010, he said. The facility will include a sinter plant, coke ovens and a captive power plant based on waste gases and coal.        
	According to the company, procuring iron ore and coking coal from captive mines will help it lower the cost of production, significantly. The initial proposed capacity of the plant was 1.3 million tonnes, which was later raised to 2.2 million tonnes.         
	Calcutta-based ductile iron ore maker Electrosteel Castings is the promoter of EIL with a 39 per cent stake. It has invested Rs 700 crore in the total equity size of Rs 1,815 crore.         
	UK-based mineral trading company Stemcor holds 22 per cent in EIL, and some private equity players own the rest.

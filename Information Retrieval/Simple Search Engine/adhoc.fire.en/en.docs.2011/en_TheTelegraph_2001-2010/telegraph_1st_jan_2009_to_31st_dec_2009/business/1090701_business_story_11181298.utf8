	New Delhi, June 30: Growth in six key infrastructure industries fell to 2.8 per cent in May against 5 per cent in April, attibutable to the poor show in crude and petroleum products.        
	Cement output, which grew 11.6 per cent, led the infrastructure performance chart, followed by coal (10.2 per cent) and electricity (3.3 per cent).         
	This is the second month in a row that cement grew over 11 per cent.         
	In May, industrial output is expected to be better. Domestic demand-driven industries such as cement, consumer goods and FMCG are doing well, Ajay Shankar, secretary in the department of industrial policy and promotion, said.        
	Industry grew 1.4 per cent in April, with 11 out of the 17 industry groups showing positive growth.        
	Shankar said domestic demand-led industries were doing better than those catering to exports.         
	Analysts said the core sector show indicated that the IIP figures in May would be better than April.

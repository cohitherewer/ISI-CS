The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Long-term pain for retail investors
                                                                                                               Long-term pain for retail investors
          OUR BUREAU                          Nerves taut                                  
	Aug. 12: Retail investors who have finally dredged up some courage to invest in a bull market will find little to cheer about in the new direct tax code.        
	Reason: the government proposes to erase the distinction between short- and long-term capital gains tax even as it seeks to abolish the securities transaction tax (STT) that was introduced in 2004.        
	The tax change could mean higher taxes on retail investors.        
	At present, investors do not have to pay a tax on capital gains if they hold the shares for more than a year. Under the new regime, they will have to do so.        
	This will hurt small investors. They will have to pay tax under the new slabs, which means investors with an income of less than Rs 10 lakh will have to pay a 10 per cent tax while those who earn between Rs 10 lakh and Rs 25 lakh will have to cough up 20 per cent, said Ernst amp; Young director (tax) Anish Thacker.        
	Investors with an income in excess of Rs 25 lakh per annum will pay tax on gains from sale of equities at 30 per cent irrespective of the time frame in which shares are sold, he said.        
	In the current tax system, investors have to pay a short-term capital gain tax. If they conduct transactions through the stock exchange, they are exempt from paying long-term capital gains tax and simply pay a securities transaction tax of 0.125 per cent.         
	If the sale of securities is done through an off-market transaction, then a 10 per cent long-term capital gains tax is applicable on the deal.         
	Besides increasing the tax burden for the small investor, the proposed new tax code will also give taxpayers more headaches in the computation of tax.         
	We may now have to go back to the old more complicated system of computation since the long-term capital gains exemption may be over. Investors will have to go in for indexation or calculate the fair market value of shares which were bought several years ago, said PricewaterhouseCoopers executive director (mergers amp; acquisition tax) Saurabh Upadhyay.        
	The markets are also wary. The details of the new tax code needed to be studied, but it can create repercussions as investors have got used to idea that long-term gains need not be paid, said Arun Kejriwal, director, KRIS.         
	Aseem Chawla, taxation partner at Amarchand amp; Mangaldas, said, This will encourage only FIIs, institutional investors and day traders to enter the market and dissuade retail investors from entering the capital market.

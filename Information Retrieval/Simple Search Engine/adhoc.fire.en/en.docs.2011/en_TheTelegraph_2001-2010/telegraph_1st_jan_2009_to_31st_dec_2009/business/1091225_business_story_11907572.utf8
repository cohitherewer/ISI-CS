          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                            
	New Delhi, Dec. 24: The core sector expanded 5.3 per cent in November, in line with the recovery in industrial production, against a meagre 0.8 per cent growth last year.        
	Steel and petroleum refinery products grew 11.7 per cent and 4.9 per cent, respectively, in November against a contraction of 6.3 per cent and 1.1 per cent, respectively, last year.        
	The overall trend is that industry is performing better than last year and is on a recovery path. There could be a month-to-month variation that should not worry much, D.K. Joshi, principal economist with rating agency Crisil, said. The core sector had grown 3.8 per cent in October.        
	Cement improved by 9 per cent against 8.7 per cent in November 2008. However, crude slipped into the negative territory by 1.6 per cent. Coal grew at a lesser pace than last year. It expanded 3.3 per cent against 9.7 per cent. Electricity growth, too, dropped to 1.8 per cent from 2.6 per cent. The six core industries contribute about 26.7 per cent to industrial production, which grew 10.3 per cent in October.        
	Food inflation falls        
	Food inflation eased a bit to 18.65 per cent in the second week of December, raising hopes of some relief from soaring prices in the months ahead. Prices of potatoes and pulses, however, remained too high for comfort.        
	The wholesale price-based index of food articles dropped 1.30 per cent for the week ended December 12 from 19.95 per cent a week ago. Potato prices have risen over 115 per cent since last year, while pulses have shot up around 42 per cent. However, analysts say the months ahead are likely to see food prices, which had shot up to a 10-year high last week, ease a little more.        
	Planning Commission deputy chairman Montek Singh Ahluwalia has said the price situation will cool down in the coming months. Stocks of cereals are adequate and prices can be moderated and it will be from January, he said.

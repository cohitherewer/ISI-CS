                                                                                                               Pfizer open offer for local arm
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                            
	Mumbai, April 13: US pharma giant Pfizer today announced an open offer for a 33.77 per cent stake in Indian arm Pfizer Ltd at Rs 675 per share, toeing the line of compatriot Mylan and Switzerlands Novartis.        
	If the offer is successful, Pfizers stake in the domestic company will go up to 75 per cent from 41.23 per cent. The $48-billion firm will spend close to Rs 680 crore in the exercise.         
	The open offer will be made by Pfizer Investments Netherlands B.V. and comes at a premium of 8.6 per cent to Pfizer Ltds closing share price of Rs 621.55 on April 9 on the National Stock Exchange.         
	It represents a premium of 22.2 per cent over Pfizer Ltds average share price on the NSE for the 30 days ending April 9.         
	The open offer will be managed by HSBC Securities and Capital Markets (India). On the BSE, Pfizer surged 10 per cent to close at Rs 685.         
	Pfizers move comes a few days after generic drug maker Mylan Labs announced plans to delist its India subsidiary Matrix Laboratories from the bourses. Mylan wants to acquire around 29 per cent of Matrix at a price of Rs 150 per share.         
	At present, Mylan holds around 71.16 per cent in Matrix. At Rs 150 per share, the parent will have to pay roughly Rs 675 crore if its offer for a voluntary delisting is successful.         
	Earlier, Novartis said it would make an open offer to acquire additional equity in Novartis India at Rs 351 per share.         
	The open offer, on full acceptance, will increase its holding in the domestic company to nearly 90 per cent. The offer will represent a total value of up to Rs 440 crore.         
	According to market circles, drug MNCs are taking advantage of low share prices in India to increase their stakes in the Indian arms.

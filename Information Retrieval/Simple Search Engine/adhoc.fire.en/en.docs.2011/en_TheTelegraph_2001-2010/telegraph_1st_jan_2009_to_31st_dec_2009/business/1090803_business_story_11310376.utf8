                                My gross income is likely to be around Rs 3.80 lakh in financial year 2009-10. Last month, I got Rs 60,000 as arrear from 2006-07 till 2008-09. What will be my tax liability in the current year? How can I claim relief under Section 89 of the income tax act for arrears?           Pradip Ghosh, Calcutta
                    For the receipt of pay and allowances pertaining to previous years as arrears, the Income Tax Act provides for relief under Section 89(1). First, you have to calculate the income tax for the taxable income without including the arrears for 2006-07, 2007-08 and 2008-09 separately based on tax structure applicable during these years. Then add apportioned arrears to the respective years taxable income and again find the tax. Find the differences in tax on account of addition of arrears in respective years. Add these differences for the three years to get the total difference in tax on account of arrears added to the taxable income in the relevant years. This is Calculation 1. Now you have to calculate the income tax for the current year first, without including the arrears and then including the total arrear amount, that is Rs 60,000, and find out the difference. This is Calculation II. If the result of Calculation 1 is less than the result of Calculation II, the difference will be your income tax relief on arrears.                                  Senior scheme      I am a senior citizen and had invested Rs 70,000 in the Senior Citizen Savings Scheme in August 2004. The amount will come for maturity in August 2009. I would like to continue the account after maturity. What is the procedure of renewal of a SCSS account?         Ajit Kumar Das, Howrah
                    After the first five years, an SCSS can be extended for a block of three years. Post maturity, you can extend the account by making an application to the deposit taking bank/post office in Form B. You have to apply for a renewal within one year of maturity of the account. However, irrespective of when you had applied for the renewal, the extension of the account will be considered from the date of maturity. Thus, you can apply for the renewal of your SCSS account before August 2010 and the extension will be applicable from August 2009.

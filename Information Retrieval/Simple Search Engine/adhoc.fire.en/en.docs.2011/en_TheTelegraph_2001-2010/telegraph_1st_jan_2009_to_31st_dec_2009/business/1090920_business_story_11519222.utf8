The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | New formula to award oil blocks
                                                                                                               New formula to award oil blocks
          R. SURYAMURTHY                          Jitin Prasada: Ready for drill                                  
	New Delhi, Sept. 19: The government plans to adopt a new pricing formula for the open acreage licensing system, which will replace the annual auctioning of oil and gas blocks under the New Exploration Licensing Policy (Nelp).        
	We plan to shift to a new method of giving out (oil and gas) blocks to bidders in an open acreage system and will be adopting a new pricing methodology, minister of state for petroleum, Jitin Prasada, said.        
	The new system, which will start in early 2011, will enable the exploration and production firms to bid for blocks at any time of the year unlike Nelp, which is an annual event.         
	Data for these blocks will be made available to the bidders through the national data repository, he said. The open acreage system will allow firms to identify the blocks or areas they want to explore instead of bidding for pre-assigned blocks.        
	The risks involved in oil and gas discovery has prodded the government to adopt the new pricing formula. Prasada said, The contractor will have to arrive at the pricing on an arms-length basis and it will have to be approved by the government.        
	The empowered group of ministers (eGoM) for Reliance Industries KG-D6 had formulated the gas price on a cost-plus principle where a return is guaranteed on all capital expenditure. The eGoM-approved formula provides for a maximum gas price of $4.2 per million British thermal unit (mBtu) at $60 a barrel crude rate. RIL gas will cost $2.5 per mBtu, if crude falls to $25.         
	This formula will be valid for five years from the date of commencement of commercial production and supply.        
	Arvind Mahajan, executive director of KPMG, said The existing gas price in India is significantly lower than international rates. Adequate gas price rationalisation is a must to attract investment in the development of gasfields and infrastructure. Cost-plus mechanism will only deter investment and competitiveness.        
	The Planning Commission has disagreed with the price fixing methodology of the eGoM. It said, Linking gas prices to crude price movement is misleading as gas is not as easily tradable as oil, because pipeline and liquefaction/re-gassification facilities take time to develop.        
	It said comparing local gas prices to spot LNG prices in the international market is grossly misleading as gas transportation requires significant investment in pipelines or in liquefaction, cryogenic shipping and re-gassification.         
	According to the Planning Commission, long-term supply contracts such as those in Europe are more representative of gas prices.        
	The government will be looking at the commercial viability and the energy needs of the country while approving the prices of energy resources, Prasada said.        
	According to analysts, global players such as Chevron, ExxonMobil, Royal Dutch Shell, and Conoco Phillips are unlikely to venture into the country unless the discovery is commercially profitable and the price is determined by market forces.        
	At present, only 50 per cent of Indian sedimentary basins are under exploration.

                                                                                                               Floor price for 3G set at Rs 3500cr
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                          Message received                                  
	New Delhi, Aug. 27: The government today fixed the minimum bid price for third-generation (3G) spectrum at Rs 3,500 crore and allowed up to five players in each circle to offer the high-speed services.        
	The auction will be completed within three months, and the winners will take another 3-5 months to roll out the services.        
	The group of ministers (GoM), headed by finance minister Pranab Mukherjee, also fixed a reserve price of Rs 1,750 crore for the auction of wireless broadband (WiMax) spectrum.        
	The government expects to raise Rs 25,000 crore from the sale of both 3G and WiMax spectrum, telecom minister A. Raja told reporters today after the GoM meeting.        
	A detailed roadmap will be announced by the department of telecom (DoT) in the next two weeks. Third-generation mobile phone services, seen as the next growth driver in telecom, allow users to surf the Internet or download content, including music and video, at a higher speed.        
	Global players such as the Americas AT amp;T, Germanys Deutsche Telekom, Frances Orange and Japans NTT DoCoMo are keen on bidding.         
	Domestic firms such as Bharti Airtel, Vodafone Essar, Reliance Communications, Tata Teleservices and newbies Unitech-Telenor and Sistema-Shyam are among those interested. Four new players will be given spectrum to provide services in each telecom circle.         
	State-run BSNL and MTNL already own and operate 3G services. They will have to match the highest auction price in each circle.        
	With only four more slots being sold, the players are likely to bid higher for the scarce spectrum, said Raja.        
	The Prime Ministers Office and the finance ministry expect 3G services to attract foreign players and generate high revenues.         
	The government, in its budget estimates, had stated that the sale of 3G spectrum would mop up Rs 35,000 crore.         
	During a meeting with Prime Minister Manmohan Singh in July, Raja and finance minister Pranab Mukherjee had reached a consensus on increasing the reserve price to Rs 4,040 crore.

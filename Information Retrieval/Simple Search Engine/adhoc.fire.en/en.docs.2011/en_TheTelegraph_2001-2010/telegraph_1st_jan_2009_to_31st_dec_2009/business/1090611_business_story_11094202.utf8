	New Delhi, June 10: Finance minister Pranab Mukherjee today asked banks to cut interest rates and provide affordable credit to industry, paving the way for cheaper car, housing and personal loans.        
	As a financial intermediary, banks have to stand by to provide credit at reasonable rates, Mukherjee said while addressing the chief executives of public sector banks.        
	According to the finance minister, the cut in key rates by the Reserve Bank is not getting adequately reflected in the reduction of the benchmark prime lending rates (BPLRs) by banks.        
	Chiefs of state-run banks, who were present at the meeting with Mukherjee, said BPLRs could be slashed 50-100 basis points over the next few months.        
	The State Bank of India, the countrys top lender, said there was scope for the banks lending and deposit rates to come down at least 25 basis points before the end of June. Our bank will decide on lowering interest rates by the end of this month, said SBI chairman . P. Bhatt.        
	At present, state run banks charge about 10-12.5 per cent from home loan borrowers and 11.5-12.5 per cent from car buyers, while private lenders charge at least 1-4 per cent more.        
	The finance minister told state-run banks that the government would infuse more funds to ensure their capital base remained strong and credit flow did not suffer.         
	Mukherjee also made a pitch for consolidation among commercial banks to improve their competitiveness, globally, and financial stability.         
	However, such proposals will have to come from the banks themselves, he said.         
	SBI merger        
	The SBI wants to merge its subsidiaries with itself to create one of the largest banks in the Asia-Pacific.         
	Our priority is whether or not we can go ahead with the consolidation of our own associates. We have six associate banks. We are waiting for a signal from the government. Based on that, we will take an appropriate action, Bhatt said.

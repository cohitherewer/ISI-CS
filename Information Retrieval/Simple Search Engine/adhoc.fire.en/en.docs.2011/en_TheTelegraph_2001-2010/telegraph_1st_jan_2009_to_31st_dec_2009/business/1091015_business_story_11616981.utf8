The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | $1.6bn cash prop
                                                                                                               $1.6bn cash prop
                            
	New Delhi, Oct. 14 (PTI): Cairn India today said it had tied up $1.6 billion in funds from domestic and overseas lenders to repay old debt and accelerate the Rajasthan project. Crude oil production from the Rajasthan field has started a few weeks back.        
	The proceeds will be used to repay the existing (loan) of $850 million and to continue funding the ongoing projects in Rajasthan, Cairn CFO Indrajit Banerjee said.        
	Cairn has borrowed $750 million from abroad and Rs 4,000 crore (about $850 million) from the local market. The overseas borrowing consists of a fully underwritten portion of $500 million by Standard Chartered and a $250-million loan by the International Finance Corp, a member of the World Bank. Domestic borrowing has been underwritten by the State Bank of India.        
	A fully underwritten loan means the lending banks are free to invite other financial institutions or banks to join the facility, Banerjee said.

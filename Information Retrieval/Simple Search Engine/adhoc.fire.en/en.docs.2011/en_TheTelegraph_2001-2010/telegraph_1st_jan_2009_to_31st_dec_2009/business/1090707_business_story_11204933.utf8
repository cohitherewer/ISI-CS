The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Fertiliser subsidy revamped
                                                                                                               Fertiliser subsidy revamped

	New Delhi, July 6: The Congress-led government has at last taken up the issue of reforming fertiliser subsidies.         
	The current system enriched a few fertiliser companies, while the impact on farmers was limited.        
	A group of experts set up by Prime Minister Manmohan Singh some time back had pointed out that large tracts of farmland in India were becoming barren because of the excessive use of a single fertiliser  urea.         
	They had blamed the current policy of subsidising urea and making it cheaper than most other fertilisers for the problem.        
	The remedy suggested was to let fertiliser manufacturers mix nutrients needed for various kinds of soil and sell as separate products.         
	The government could then pay a subsidy on the retail price if the farmer picked up the nutrient mix that his districts soil needed. The subsidy could be paid on sale either directly to the farmer or to the marketers.         
	The nutrient mix subsidy programme has been proposed keeping a ceiling of Rs 26,000 crore on payouts as subsidy. This is against last years urea subsidy bill of Rs 34,000 crore and this years projected bill of Rs 45,000 crore.         
	The farmer will not feel the impact of the reduced subsidy as industry will be forced to design more efficient products choosing the right combination of nutrients. The increased efficiency of nutrient use would more than compensate the reduced subsidy, officials said.        
	One method of paying the subsidy, which has been suggested by Tata Consultancy Services to the department of fertilisers, is by giving farmers smart cards to buy the fertiliser mix at cheaper rates.         
	However, this has been attacked by politicians as impracticable in most states. The government feels the main advantage of the smart card system is of subsidy going directly to the farmers. It can also be targeted to a particular segment of the population or the farmers.         
	For example, small and marginal farmers could get more subsidy in percentage terms. Importantly, fertiliser purchasing power would remain the same for farmers receiving the subsidy.         
	However, if a section of farmers are left uncovered by the new system, they would suffer considerably. At the same time, prices of fertilisers would no longer be controlled and therefore may come on par with global levels. Fertiliser units, who are efficient, will actually gain from the new system while those which are not so efficient may fall by the wayside.

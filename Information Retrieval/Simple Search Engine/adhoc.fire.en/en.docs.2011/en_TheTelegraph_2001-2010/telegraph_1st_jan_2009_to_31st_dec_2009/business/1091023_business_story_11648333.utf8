The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Sleuths knock on telecom door
                                                                                                               Sleuths knock on telecom door
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                                            
	New Delhi, Oct. 22: Sleuths from the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) today trooped into Sanchar Bhavan  the headquarters of the department of telecommunications  and pored over documents relating to the allocation of second generation (2G) licences and spectrum to new mobile telephony companies last year.        
	The preliminary investigation was ordered by the Central Vigilance Commission, which had received several complaints about irregularities in licence allotments made in January 2008.        
	CBI officials said they would scrutinise all the records relating to the recent allocation of spectrum (or the airwaves through which mobile calls travel).        
	Telecom minister A. Raja, however, refuted allegations of wrongdoing and added that the licences and spectrum had been allocated in conformity with a long-standing telecom policy.        
	The CVC had raised some questions on this (2G spectrum allocation). We have given our reply...all licences have been allocated according to telecom rules, said Raja.        
	Ruling out the possibility of his resignation, Raja said, All decisions on spectrum licensing have been taken in consultations with the Prime Minister.        
	Soon after the Congress alliance won the general elections in May, the political grapevine was abuzz with talk that Prime Minister Manmohan Singh wanted to drop Raja from his cabinet as he had become embroiled in the controversy over spectrum allocations.         
	Raja had been the telecom minister in the previous government, taking over from DMK party colleague Dayanidhi Maran who had then fallen out with Karunanidhi. Despite his disapproval, Singh had to accommodate Raja and keep the DMK within the UPA fold.        
	The controversy had erupted in early 2008 after the DoT allotted eight telecom licences and 4.4 megahertz of start-up spectrum at a price fixed in 2001 to a batch of new Indian players, including real estate firms who had no experience of running telecom operations, as also existing operators.         
	Critics had then said the government would have earned a lot more if it had invited global bids for the spectrum that it auctioned.        
	The Opposition, led by the BJP and Left parties, raised a ruckus over the issue in Parliament and termed the deal as manipulative and biased towards certain firms.        
	Critics said the DoT had handed out the licences without adhering to the first come, first served principle that the Union cabinet had formulated. Moreover, licence holders had paid only Rs 1,650 crore as fees  a price arrived at in 2001 when the fourth cellular licence was auctioned.         
	With no lock-in period for the sale of promoters equity, realtors such as Swan and Unitech, who had bagged the mobile telephony licences, sold part of their stake to foreign telecom players at a premium of Rs 2,450 crore over what they had paid for the licences.        
	The price at which the government doled out spectrum was a huge underestimation of the real price, which was discovered when the licences were sold in the marketplace. We had pointed this out then. We hope that the CBI will garner enough evidence to establish why this was done despite strong opposition, said Nilotpal Basu, CPM leader and former MP.        
	After the criticism erupted, the DoT introduced a three-year lock-in period to forestall immediate sale of the promoters stake by start-up telecom companies. However, this rule does not apply when a strategic investor pumps money into a company by subscribing to fresh equity as in the case of the Unitech and Swan Telecom deals.        
	The government is currently scrutinising the ownership structures and shareholding patterns of Swan Telecom and Loop Telecom to determine whether they violated any regulations.        
	Critics also point out that while inviting applications for new telecom licences in 2007, the telecom ministry had, in an arbitrary manner, announced September 25, 2007 as the cut-off date for the submission of applications for new telecom licences. As a result, 24 companies were barred from bidding for the licences. Earlier, the DoT had announced October 1, 2007 as the cut-off date. In April, Delhi High Court quashed the telecom ministrys cut-off date for granting licences.         
	However, the DoT is not in favour of issuing fresh licences as the number of pending applications in every circle ranges from 13 to 19 (companies).        
	Several companies have alleged that the DoT changed the cut-off date so that entities such as Swan, Unitech, Loop, Datacom and Shyam could get the licences. So far, the DoT has provided no explanation for the sudden change in the cut-off date.        
	Earlier this week, former Tamil Nadu chief minister J. Jayalalithaa has asked the Prime Minister to drop Raja from the cabinet for his misdemeanours in allotting spectrum.        
	The government has currently put on hold all fresh allocation of spectrum and licences till a revised 2G spectrum allocation policy is finalised.

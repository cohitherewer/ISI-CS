          OUR BUREAU                          Good health                                  
	New Delhi, Sept. 6: Industry confidence on the economy has improved after the governments stimulus packages, according to a survey by Ficci.        
	A majority of the respondents said the packages had spurred firms to raise their activities.        
	Going ahead, India will see an improvement in its growth performance, Ficcis business confidence survey for the first quarter of 2009-10 said. The business confidence index for the April-June period moved up to 67.2 from 64.1 in the last quarter of 2008-09 (January-March).        
	However, the poor progress and spread of monsoon this year could put a damper on economic growth, the chamber found on the flip side.        
	On expectations about the overall economic conditions, the survey said, We see that close to 73 per cent of the companies feel that things will improve in the coming six months.        
	Performances are likely to improve in the near term, with major segments posting good growth in the first quarter of this fiscal and global recession showing signs of easing.        
	Four out of five respondents felt that the stimulus measures were having a tangible effect on the countrys economic performance.        
	In the first quarter of this fiscal, Indias GDP grew 6.1 per cent even after the global financial meltdown.        
	In the survey, 372 companies participated from sectors such as textiles, cement, steel, leather, chemicals and fertilisers, oil and gas, auto and machinery.        
	The survey said besides the weak demand, other factors impacting industrys performance were the rising cost of raw materials, manpower and credit.

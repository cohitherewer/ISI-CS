          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Ahluwalia                                   
	Calcutta, Dec. 22: Planning Commission deputy chairman Montek Singh Ahluwalia expects food prices to come down in January.        
	Ruling out the need for an immediate intervention by the Reserve Bank, Ahluwalia today said the recent spurt in the prices could be attributed to speculative activities following the drought earlier this year.        
	Ahluwalias comment came a day after C. Rangarajan, chairman of the Economic Advisory Council to the Prime Minister, suggested that the RBI could tweak the cash reserve ratio to suck out liquidity from the system.        
	I am of the view that you would see a decline in food prices in January. What is seen now is a speculative build-up, Ahluwalia said. He argued that the impact of drought was less than what was initially feared.         
	Speaking from Delhi via a video link for the CII National Conference on leadership in Calcutta, Ahluwalia said the import of food items would not help in checking inflation as world prices were higher than domestic levels.         
	Ahluwalia admitted that the rise in potato and vegetables prices was a matter of concern, and the ministry concerned would take appropriate action. Unlike rice or wheat, of which it holds stocks, the government cannot make potato and vegetables more affordable through ration shops.

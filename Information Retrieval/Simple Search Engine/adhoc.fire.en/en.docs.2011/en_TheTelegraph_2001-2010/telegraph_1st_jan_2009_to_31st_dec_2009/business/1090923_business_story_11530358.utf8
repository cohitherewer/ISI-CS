The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Ways to keep alliance on track
                                                                                                               Ways to keep alliance on track
          PIYA SINGH                              
	Mumbai, Sept. 22: Takeover specialists reckon that the Bharti-MTN deal can still go through in its present form.         
	However, if that doesnt pass muster, the two telecom giants can use a couple of devices to keep the prospect of a grand alliance on track.        
	The experts are focusing on the semantics behind the deal talk. Back in May when it announced the proposed transaction, Bharti said MTN and its shareholders would acquire an approximate 36 per cent economic interest in Bharti pursuant to a scheme of arrangement.         
	A scheme of arrangement under Sections 391 to 394 of the Companies Act typically goes to the high court for approval and thereafter, under regulation 3(1)(J) of the takeover code, an exemption to the open offer is available, said Vivek Gupta, partner (mergers and acquisitions) at BMR Advisors.        
	Another M amp;A expert said Bharti had two built-in defences in the deal structure. First, the company was pursuing the scheme of arrangement route and, second, it has not specified whether the ADRs and GDRs would carry voting rights.        
	Considering the high profile nature of the deal, if the two telecom giants face opposition, MTN may have to go in for an open offer.         
	This will automatically increase the transaction cost by 20 per cent as MTN will have to pay the minority shareholders money to acquire another 20 per cent.        
	This is a scenario that the Mittals of the Bharti group will like to avoid since it immediately will raise the spectre of a loss of control.        
	The challenge will be to minimise cash leakages and come up with a new deal structure to ensure that Bharti pays out the minimum cash possible, said Gupta.        
	The third option before Bharti and MTN will be to increase the cash component of the deal and settle for a lower shareholding.         
	However, this route might not be acceptable to the South African company and its shareholders who would like to own a significant stake in Bharti. In any case, Bharti will then have to raise funds to raise the cash component of the deal.        
	Bankers also said that Bharti and MTN could abandon the deal in its present form if they were forced into a corner and simply opt for a merger of operations instead.

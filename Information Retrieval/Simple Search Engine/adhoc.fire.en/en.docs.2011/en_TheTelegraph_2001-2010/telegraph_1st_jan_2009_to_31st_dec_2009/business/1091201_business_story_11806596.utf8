          OUR LEGAL REPORTER                              
	Calcutta, Nov. 30: Justice Pranab Kumar Chattopadhyay of Calcutta High Court today passed an interim order that restrained the authorities of Dunlop Company Limited from transferring any assets till the disposal of a petition moved by a company that used to supply raw materials to Dunlop but did not receive full payment.        
	The petitioner claimed that the central government through a notification had declared Dunlop a relief undertaking company.         
	According to law, no one has the right to demand the transfer of assets or the liquidation of a company unless the central government takes it out from the relief undertaking list.         
	The petitioner demanded an order from Calcutta High Court to quash the notification of the central government. Justice Chattopadhyay admitted the petition for hearing and passed the interim order.        
	Dunlop is due to resume operations from Wednesday.

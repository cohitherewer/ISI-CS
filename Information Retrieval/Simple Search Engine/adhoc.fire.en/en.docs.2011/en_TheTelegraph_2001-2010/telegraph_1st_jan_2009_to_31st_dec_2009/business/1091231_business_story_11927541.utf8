          OUR BUREAU                          Growth focus                                  
	Bhubaneswar/Calcutta, Dec. 30: Infosys Technologies will set up its second project in Orissa near Bhubaneswar at a cost of Rs 300 crore.         
	Infosys, the second-largest IT company in India employing more than 1 lakh professionals, has another centre in Bhubaneswar, where 3,000 people work.         
	T.V. Mohandas Pai, director (human resources) of Infosys, informed Orissa chief minister Naveen Patnaik yesterday that construction would start soon.         
	The project will employ 5,000 professionals, he said. Land has been allotted in the Info Valley being developed along the national highway near Bhubaneswar.         
	Orissa will provide water and electricity, officials said. At present, software worth Rs 850 crore is exported from Infosyss Bhubaneswar centre. The company hopes exports will go up significantly after the second project takes off.         
	Bengal project        
	Bengal, which has been lobbying for an Infosys centre over the past few years, is yet to get any official confirmation from the company.         
	They have not said no to us. Yes, the process is taking time, but I hope Infosys will get back with a positive response early next year, state IT minister Debesh Das said.         
	Infosys had asked for 90 acres to set up a development centre in Bengal. The company had to wait for almost three years before the state came up with an offer that was acceptable to it.         
	In April 2008, the state signed agreements with both Infosys and Wipro promising 90 acres each at Rajarhat.        
	On September 7, the Bengal government shelved the information technology township project meant to showcase Infosys and Wipro following the Vedic Village controversy.         
	Wipro and Infosys had been promised 90 acres each in the 1,200-acre complex being planned as a joint venture among state-run Webel, Raj Modi, the promoter of Vedic Village, and Amarnath Shroff of Diamond Group, a real estate investor.        
	However, on September 17, Bengal came up with an alternative proposal.         
	Infosys and Wipro were allotted 45 acres each to set up their facilities. Wipro has accepted the offer at Rs 1.5 crore an acre, while Infosys is yet to respond.        
	In the last quarter of 2008, Infosys had said the company might re-think its plan to set up a centre in Bengal as the state was going slow on land promised to the company.         
	The company also attributed rivalry among political parties as a reason for the land delay.

	Mumbai, Feb. 1: Multi Commodity Exchange of India Limited is keen on an exchange for trading in equities and another exclusively for small and medium enterprises.         
	MCX is part of Financial Technologies (India) Ltd, which has floated entities for dealing in commodity futures and currency derivatives.         
	The SME bourse will enhance the portfolio of the Financial Technologies group, while it sees the other proposed exchange as a rival to both the Bombay Stock Exchange and National Stock Exchange.         
	Informed sources said MCX wanted to host both spot and futures trading, with subsidiary MCX Stock Exchange being the likely vehicle. MCX-SX operates an exchange for currency derivatives, which was launched in October.         
	According to sources, MCX is now engaged in discussions with the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) for setting up operations to trade in shares, and a concrete development is likely to occur in the next six months.        
	When contacted, Joseph Massey, managing director and CEO of MCX, refrained from commenting on the new plans.         
	He said MCX-SX was a stock exchange where the launch of trading in any new asset such as shares needed approval from Sebi.        
	Last year, Sebi had released the norms for SME bourses, stipulating trading on an existing stock exchange platform or a new bourse.        
	Financial Technologies specialises in assets markets. It has businesses in various aspects of trading such as clearing, depository, information vending and payment gateway and operates 11 exchanges in India and abroad.        
	According to Jignesh Shah, chairman, Financial Technologies, the group is also eyeing interest rate derivatives apart from credit default swaps, bonds and other products. In interest rate derivative, the underlying asset is the right to pay or receive an amount of money at a particular interest rate.         
	Shah was speaking to newspersons last week in Goa at a conference on the future of financial markets. He said the company expected to diversify its sources of earning and rely less on the brokerage solution, Odin.        
	It sees great potential in Atom, which facilitates payments through mobile phones.        
	Robust show        
	Financial Technologies operating revenue for the third quarter ended December 31, 2008 has increased 58 per cent to Rs 62.4 crore from Rs 39.3 crore in the year-ago period.         
	Net profit, excluding project divestment income, grew 53 per cent to Rs 43.2 crore during the reporting quarter.         
	The companys board has declared a 100 per cent interim dividend at Rs 2 per share.

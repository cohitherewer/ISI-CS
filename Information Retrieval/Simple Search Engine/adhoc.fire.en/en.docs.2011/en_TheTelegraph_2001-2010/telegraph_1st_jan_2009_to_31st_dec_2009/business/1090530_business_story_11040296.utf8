	Mumbai, May 29: Tata Motors, the countrys leading vehicle maker, saw its net profit plunge 51 per cent to Rs 1,001.26 crore during the year ended March 31 as the global slowdown choked demand and financing constraints hit the company.        
	The company had recorded a net profit of Rs 2,028.92 crore last year.        
	Total income for the year declined 10.7 per cent to Rs 25,661 crore compared with Rs 28,739 crore in 2007-08.        
	On Friday, the board of Tata Motors also announced the appointment of Prakash M. Telang, the current executive director (commercial vehicles), as the managing director of its India operations from June 2.        
	The present managing director of the company, Ravi Kant, will retire from his executive position on June 1. He will be retained on the board as the non-executive vice-chairman of the company.        
	Explaining the reasons for the drop in profits and sales in 2008-09, the company said, Demand contraction was triggered by high interest rates and unavailability of finance throughout the year, particularly in the October-December quarter post the global market upheavals.        
	Heavy commercial vehicles were the worst hit as the slowdown hurt freight movement.         
	High input costs increased pressure on margins. Profit before tax fell about 61 per cent to Rs 1,014 crore in 2008-09 compared with Rs 2,576 crore in the last year.        
	Domestic commercial vehicles sales totalled 2,65,373 units compared with 3,12,935 units a year earlier.        
	Domestic passenger vehicle sales amounted to 2,07,512 vehicles during the year. The company sold 2,18,055 passenger vehicles in 2007-08.        
	The launch of the second generation Tata Indica Vista and sales from Tata Indigo CS helped it recover market share in the second half of the year.                          
	The company, which acquired Jaguar Land Rover for $ 2.3 billion last June, recently arranged refinancing for the debt it had taken on in its books for this acquisition.        
	It also launched the Nano during 2008-09 and has received over 2.03 lakh fully paid booking for the small car. It expects to begin deliveries of the Nano in July.               
	The company said the Pantnagar plant had started producing the Nano during the year. The plant at Sanand in Gujaratwhere the Nano will eventually be made -- is nearing completion.

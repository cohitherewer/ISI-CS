                                                                                                               Hotels dangle monsoon bait

	New Delhi, June 14: Top hotel chains are offering up to a 20 per cent discount on room rates and special packages to lure tourists during the monsoon season.         
	Monsoon is not a season for doing brisk business for hoteliers. Room rates head south. But the sector is still trying to fight the impact of the slowdown by offering free nights, discounts and budgetary packages to maintain occupancy, said Subhash Goyal, chairman of Stic Travel.        
	Hotel Leelaventure has announced a special monsoon rate of Rs 3,300 a night at its Kovalam property. It has also lined up attractive offers for its other properties.        
	Sanjay Pasricha, vice-president (sales and marketing) of Hotel Leelaventure, said, Our monsoon rates are priced at least 10 per cent below the summer prices. As a result, our top leisure destinations such as Goa and Kovalam are witnessing 65-75 per cent occupancy.        
	Other hotel chains, including Taj Hotels, Oberoi, ITC- Welcomgroup and Hyatt, are offering a free night stay for every stay of at least two or three nights.        
	Marriott International is giving back guests Rs 3,000 of the total bill for use in the hotels spa, gymnasium and dining facilities.        
	Hotels were badly hit by the terror attacks in Mumbai. Most of the foreign nations had announced travel advisories against making trips to India.         
	The slowdown also narrowed the profit margins of hoteliers.         
	Net profits of almost all the premier hotel companies had halved at the end of the third quarter.

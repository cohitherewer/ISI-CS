	New Delhi, April 12: Next years Commonwealth Games here is expected to generate 2 lakh jobs in the hotel business.        
	Compare this to the governments admission of 5 lakh job losses between September and December because of the global financial crisis.        
	The Commonwealth Games will be held next year and there will be immense opportunities in the hospitality sector. We believe it will create more jobs than any other sector, said tourism secretary Sujit Banerjee.        
	In the run-up to the event, hotels are likely to add around 1.5 lakh rooms to be managed by over 2 lakh trained personnel, according to estimates provided by Union tourism minister Ambika Soni.         
	About 1 lakh of these rooms are in the budget segment, while the rest will be in the star categories, said M.P. Puroshottaman, president of the Federation of Hotel and Restaurant Associations of India.         
	The industry needs trained personnel such as tour guides and hotel staff.         
	We need to train personnel and stop con artists from working as guides. Tour guides must have proper training, good language and a badge. Also, they must be groomed to have a helping mentality, said a study on the tourism industry conducted by the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry.        
	The industry has started feeling the pinch of global slowdown with the number of foreign tourists arriving in India showing a significant decline this year.        
	The number of tourists visiting the country touched 4,71,627 in March this year as against 5,41,478 in March 2008, which is 69,851 less.        
	Skilled personnel        
	The government has approved the setting up of eight institutes of hotel management during the current financial year.        
	The National Council for Hotel Management and Catering Technology, an autonomous body under the ministry of tourism, is currently co-ordinating hospitality education and training in the country.         
	It has 21 central and seven state institutes of hotel management, seven food craft institutes and 12 private institutes of hotel management as its affiliates.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                           Ratan Tata in Mumbai on Tuesday. (PTI)                                  
	Mumbai, Aug. 25: Tata Motors chairman Ratan Tata today defended his acquisition of Jaguar-Land Rover. He said the move was worthwhile and should be seen from a long-term perspective, when the takeover would benefit the company.         
	Tata was addressing shareholders at Tata Motors 64th annual general meeting today. The JLR acquisition was blamed for Tata Motors Rs 2,505-crore loss in 2008-09.         
	Responding to criticism that the acquisition was expensive and that it would hurt the company, Tata said the performance of the company should be seen in the context of the global economic slowdown.         
	There has been a lot of commentary and expert opinion that the JLR acquisition was too high priced and it endangered our well-being. I emphatically refute this. Yes, there could be challenges, its not caused by the product or portfolio but by the global phenomenon, he told shareholders.         
	Tata said the $2.3 billion spent to acquire JLR, which belonged to Ford, was not a bad investment. He told the shareholders that JLR was a profit-making company in 2007 as well as in the first half of 2008. The global financial crisis has affected the company. Its unfortunate that external factors came to play in a rather devastating manner.         
	He said both Tata Motors and the overseas company would look to cut costs and raise margins.         
	On the Nano, Tata said the Sanand plant in Gujarat would be ready by December this year. Tata Motors is planning to introduce the car in Europe by 2011-12.         
	The land at Singur in Bengal, from where Tata Motors shifted the Nano plant, is with the company.         
	We will certainly go back to Bengal if circumstances are not as agitative When we went there, it was a good decision, but unfortunately we had problems, Tata said.

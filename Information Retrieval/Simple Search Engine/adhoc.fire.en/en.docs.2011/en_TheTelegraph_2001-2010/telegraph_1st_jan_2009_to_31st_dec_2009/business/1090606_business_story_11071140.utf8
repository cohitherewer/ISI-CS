                          Pandit: Moment of crisis                    
	New York, June 5 (PTI): Americas Federal Deposit Insurance Corp (FDIC) is pressing for a top management reshuffle in troubled financial institution Citigroup, a move that may threaten chief executive Vikram Pandits position in the company, a media report says.        
	According to The Wall Street Journal, The Federal Deposit Insurance Corp is pushing for a shake-up of Citigroup Incs top management, imperiling chief executive Vikram Pandit.         
	The FDIC, under chairperson Sheila Bair, also recently pressed a fellow regulator to lower the governments confidential ranking of Citis health  a change that would let regulators control the firm more tightly, the report said.        
	Besides being a government regulatory body insuring bank deposits, the FDIC acts as a receiver for collapsed banks among its many other responsibilities.

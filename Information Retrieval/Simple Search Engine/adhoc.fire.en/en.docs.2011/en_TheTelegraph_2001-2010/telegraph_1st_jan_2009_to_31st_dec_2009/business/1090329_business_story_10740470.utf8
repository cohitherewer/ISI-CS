The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Two more banks cut rates
                                                                                                               Two more banks cut rates
                            
	March 28 (PTI): Two more banks have jumped on the rate-cut bandwagon.         
	Andhra Bank has reduced its benchmark prime lending rate by 25 basis points. With this, the rate will come down from 12.50 per cent to 12.25 per cent from April 1, 2009, an Andhra Bank release said.        
	The Central Bank of India, on the other hand, has reduced its benchmark prime lending rate (BPLR) by 0.50 per cent to 12 per cent.        
	The reduced rate is effective from April 1, a bank spokesperson said.        
	The reduction in lending rates will be applicable to all BPLR-related portfolios and is intended to meet the credit demands of needy segments, the spokesperson said.        
	After the Reserve Bank of India cut its repo and reverse repo rates by 0.50 per cent each recently, many state-owned and private sector banks had reduced their BPLRs to pass on the benefit of lower interest rates to their customers.        
	Some of the banks which had cut their prime lending rates are Union Bank, Bank of India, ICICI Bank and Punjab National Bank.

	New Delhi, July 31: The power ministry said it would approach the Supreme Court if it did not get a favourable judgment from Bombay High Court regarding the supply of gas to NTPC from Reliance Industries Ltd.         
	Agitated over the protracted delay in the case, CPM leader Tapan Sen today sought Prime Minister Manmohan Singhs inter vention to get gas for the state-run power generator from the KG basin at rates lower than those fixed by the government.        
	On whether the power ministry would move the apex court to get 12 million metric standard cubic meters of gas per day at $2.34 per million British thermal unit, power secretary H.S. Brahma said, Of course...why notit is our rightthere is nothing wrong in that.

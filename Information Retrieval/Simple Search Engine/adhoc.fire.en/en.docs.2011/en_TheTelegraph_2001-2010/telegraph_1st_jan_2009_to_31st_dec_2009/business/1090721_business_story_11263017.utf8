                                                                                                               Pandey defends govt move
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Pandey: Firm stand                                  
	New Delhi, July 20: Petroleum secretary R.S. Pandey today defended the petition filed by the government.         
	If such a private MoU comes into effect, other contractors may also frame such agreements and appropriate the national assets among themselves. The governments role is not restricted to collecting royalty and profit from petroleum. Our role is also to see equitable industrial development, Pandey said.        
	Other industries will be dependent on RIL and RNRL for the scarce fuel, he said while explaining the need for the government to move the Supreme Court to prevent the use of natural resources through private agreements.        
	Reacting to Pandeys comments, RNRL counsel Mahesh Aggarwal said, Such statements ought not to be made when the entire matter is sub-judice. The government has no locus to comment or intervene in a commercial matter involving two corporate entities.

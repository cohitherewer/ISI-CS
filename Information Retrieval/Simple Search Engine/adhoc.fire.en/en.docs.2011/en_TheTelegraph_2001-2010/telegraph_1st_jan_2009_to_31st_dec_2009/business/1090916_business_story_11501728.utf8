	Calcutta, Sept. 15: The corporate affairs ministry will soon come out with a road map for companies planning to switch to the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) from April 1, 2011 from the Indian Accounting Standards.         
	The IFRS is a global accounting format, which can be used by companies in any country to state their financials. By switching to this platform, an Indian companys financials can be compared with any firm in the US, which follows this accounting standard.         
	Speaking to reporters after a seminar organised by the Indian Chamber of Commerce, corporate affairs minister Salman Khurshid said, Well announce the road map in November.         
	The ministry had earlier announced that all listed and public interest companies and smaller companies having a debt of Rs 250 crore would have to compulsorily switch to the IFRS from the financial year beginning April 1, 2011.        
	But as of now, besides the Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority (Irda), no other regulators have revealed road maps for companies under their regulations for the convergence.         
	We are in talks with the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) and other regulators on this. However, we have not yet decided which categories of corporations will have to follow this road map compulsorily, Khurshid said. Smaller companies have already started lobbying the ministry to relax the April 2011 deadline as the convergence to the IFRS involves high costs.         
	The minister didnt say anything explicitly, but it is understood that the threshold (of a company) for complying with the convergence deadline can be relaxed.         
	The minister didnt clarify whether the road map would provide relaxation on the requirement of parallel reporting. A condition for the adoption of the IFRS from 2011-12 is that companies will have to restate their accounts for 2010-11 both under the IFRS and the Indian standard.         
	There is, however, no clear direction either from the government or from individual regulators on this. The IFRS will have a significant impact on revenues, assets and liabilities and earnings per share of companies. Besides, it will also affect the capital position of companies.         
	For example, there is no concept of preference capital under the IFRS. Preference capital is considered as debt under the IFRS.         
	Convergence to IFRS will also require changes in the income tax rules.

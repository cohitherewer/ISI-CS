	New Delhi, June 11: States today sought relaxation of the fiscal deficit targets, enabling them to spend more and overcome the slowdown.        
	This was discussed at a pre-budget meeting between state finance ministers and Union finance minister Pranab Mukherjee here today.        
	States also cautioned the Centre against the divestment of central public sector undertakings.        
	Bengal finance minister Asim Dasgupta told newspersons after the meeting, The finance minister was very receptive to our ideas. We cautioned him against taking short-term measures such as the disinvestment of profitable PSUs, which could compromise long-term earning streams.         
	Mukherjee told his state counterparts that it was necessary to deliberate on policies that would boost economic growth without widening the fiscal deficit, such as the introduction of the goods and services tax by April 2010.         
	However, states feel this does not exclude them from increasing their fiscal deficits in line with the Centres. The FRBM (fiscal responsibility budget management) Act may be relaxed for a while to enable us to spend our way out of this period of slowdown, Dasgupta said.        
	The central government has already indicated that it will be raising its fiscal deficit target to 5.5 per cent of GDP against an earlier objective of bringing it down to less than 2 per cent.         
	The FRBM Act, enacted by Parliament in 2003, imposes limits on the fiscal and revenue deficits. The government is required to reduce the revenue deficit by 0.5 per cent of GDP and fiscal deficit by 0.3 per cent of GDP every year.        
	States also called for an increase in their share of central taxes. They requested it to be raised to 50 per cent from the present inadequate proportion of 30. 5 per cent.        
	Dasgupta said, As taxation potential is limited, while demand for social investment is huge, extra spending this year by a state should be borne by the Centre.         
	Mukherjee laid stress on strategies to boost growth without significantly impacting the fiscal deficit. We have to deliberate on ways and means to bring the economy to a higher growth trajectory without fiscal profligacy.

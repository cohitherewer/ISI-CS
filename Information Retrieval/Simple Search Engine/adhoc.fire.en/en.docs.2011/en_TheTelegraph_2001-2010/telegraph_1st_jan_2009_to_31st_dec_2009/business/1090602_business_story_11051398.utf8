	New Delhi, June 1: Industry today lobbied for tax sops and incentives in its pre-budget meeting with finance minister Pranab Mukherjee.        
	India Inc called for a single rate of taxation, greater investment in infrastructure, demand stimulation, moderate corporate tax structure and the removal of custom duty anomalies.        
	This would pave the way for bringing the growth trajectory back to 9 per cent and lead to financial and social inclusion, Ficci president Harsh Pati Singhania said.         
	CII president Venu Srinivasan said, Additional public funds could be mobilised through divestment in select PSUs and by attracting foreign exchange by issuing sovereign-backed bonds.        
	Sunil Bharti Mittal, Chandrajit Banerjee of the CII, Swati Piramal and Venugopal Dhoot were also present.         
	Mukherjee  faced with the challenge of reviving the economy battered by the global financial meltdown and domestic demand contraction  had started pre-budget consultations soon after taking charge last Monday.         
	He had said the focus would be on the aam aadmi and sectors such as textiles, leather and gems and jewellery.         
	Industrialists urged the government to make the most of low inflation to help them get a better deal from banks on interest rates, which they wanted to be trimmed to single digits from 12 per cent at present. Srinivasan said the rates in India were high compared with many other economies.         
	The pre-budget memorandums submitted by industry bodies also called for the reintroduction of investment allowance, restoration of depreciation rate for plant and machinery at 25 per cent and extension of tax holidays to IT firms.

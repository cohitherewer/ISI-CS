	New Delhi, March 7: The government will announce detailed guidelines for mobile virtual network services by mid-March.         
	The Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai), which had been asked to provide clarifications on certain policy issues, has said any difference between the government and the regulator will not delay the announcement.         
	The government is ready to take a final view, even if it deviates from our proposals, Trai chairman Nripendra Misra told The Telegraph. Trai will send its reply on the clarifications sought by the government by March 11.        
	Last month, the department of telecom (DoT) had said the detailed policy for mobile virtual network operators (MVNOs) would be announced after it receives response from Trai on some issues.         
	Misra did not divulge the details of the clarifications sought, but said the DoT letter is in the nature of a legal requirement. They had to send these points on which they do not agree.         
	According to convention, if the DoT differs from Trai on any issue, the department is mandated to refer the matter back to the regulator. The regulator then has 15 days to review its earlier recommendation after which the government is free to decide the final policy.        
	DoT officials said, The MVNO policy is ready, we are awaiting the Trais responsewhich is a formality.        
	According to the officials, the election code of conduct is not applicable to the announcement of policy details.

                                                                                                               Promoters of Dish TV sell stake to raise cash
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Calcutta, June 8: The founder-promoters of Dish TV India Ltd have sold a 5.8 per cent stake for Rs 270 crore in a series of block deals to partially fund an upcoming rights issue.         
	The second tranche of the planned rights issue is due. So, the funds will be deployed back into the company for its payment, Dish TV managing director Jawahar Goel said. The rights issue has been planned in three parts.        
	Last year, the company had approved raising Rs 1,140 crore through rights. Most of which were subscribed for by the founders because of a market slump, Goel said.        
	Dish TV sold shares at Rs 49 each, which is a discount of 9 per cent to the last traded price on Friday.        
	The promoters stake had risen to 80 per cent after the rights issue. So, they had to sell 5-6 per cent to keep 26 per cent free float, the company said.        
	Last week, the company had also approved the raising of up to $200 million through foreign currency convertible bonds.         
	Lanxess deal        
	German chemicals firm Lanxess has agreed to buy the chemical business of Mumbai-based Gwalior Chemical Industries for Rs 536 crore (82.4 million euro).         
	The deal is expected to be completed by September 30 this year.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Green drive in full swing
                                                                                                               Green drive in full swing
          SOUNAK MITRA                          Concerted effort                                   
	Calcutta, Sept. 21: Green has become the key to success for consumer electronics giants such as Samsung, LG, Philips, Godrej and Whirlpool.         
	Companies are now trying to push their environment-friendly products to white goods consumers. Price-sensitive consumers are also ready to shell out 5-15 per cent more for white goods with a green tag.        
	The green drive, which started with the introduction of energy-efficient airconditioners and refrigerators to judge the market sentiment this summer, is now being extended to other consumer electronics goods such as television sets, washing machines and microwave ovens.         
	Consumer durables firms are also promoting product recycling to reduce e-waste and increase the use of eco-friendly components.         
	Even before the summer promotions started this year, Samsung, Godrej, Whirlpool and LG had made their ACs and refrigerators star-rated.         
	Next on cards are energy-efficient television sets and washing machines.         
	The recently introduced LED television sets  a segment almost every TV maker is venturing into  consumes about 40 per cent less power than the LCD ones.        
	The driving force behind the idea of energy-efficiency is the Bureau of Energy Efficiency, a body under the Union power ministry.         
	Given the growing consciousness among consumers and Samsungs own initiative in promoting eco-friendly products, we have already introduced 71 five-star rated refrigerator models in India, which are manufactured at our Noida facility. We are soon going to introduce star-rated slim TVs in India, Samsung India deputy managing director Ravinder Zutshi told The Telegraph.         
	LG India plans to make all its products fully recyclable.

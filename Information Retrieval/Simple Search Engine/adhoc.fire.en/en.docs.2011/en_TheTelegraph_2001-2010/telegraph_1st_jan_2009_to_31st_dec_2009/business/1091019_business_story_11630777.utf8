The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Centre wraps trade gift for Hasina
                                                                                                               Centre wraps trade gift for Hasina

	New Delhi, Oct. 18: The UPA government plans to offer Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina Wajed improved trade terms during her first visit to India, scheduled next month, after coming back to power.        
	Also in the pipeline are proposals to upgrade Bangladeshs rail network and a railway line from Tripuras Agartala.        
	India is likely to agree to trade in garments, ceramics and tiles, footwear and sports goods. Currently, manufacturers of these products from Bangladesh cannot sell them in India.        
	This is part of an exercise to prune the negative list  a roster of products that India does not buy from Bangladesh  by almost half from around 400.         
	Though the number of banned items has been reduced to 400 from 700, traders in Bangladesh complained that the slimmer list did not include important products such as garments and footwear.        
	Finance ministry officials said India was attaching a great deal of importance to Hasinas visit and want to try and resolve hurdles related to trade and other issues with its eastern neighbour.        
	The Prime Ministers Office has given instructions to clear all pending issues concerning Bangladesh and present Hasina with concrete offers.        
	Prime Minister Manmohan Singh wants finance minister Pranab Mukherjee to be the point of contact for India vis--vis Hasina. Railway minister Mamata Banerjee has also been asked to be present during Hasinas visit as the two leaders are believed to get along well.        
	The leaders of both the governments enjoy very close relations and we want to use that to leapfrog the relationship, resolving as many issues as possible, the officials said.         
	If need be, India will travel the extra mile and give some concessions unilaterally as it is the bigger market.         
	Bangladesh has always maintained that bilateral trade terms are tilted heavily in favour of India. Around 27 products in which Bangladesh has a competitive advantage are banned from imports.        
	Exports from Bangladesh to India during 2007-08 stood at a mere $358.08 million. This is about a tenth of Indias exports of $3.375 billion to Bangladesh. Officials said the basic outline of the new trade deal was laid during Bangladesh foreign minister Dipu Monis visit to New Delhi last month.         
	Rail link        
	Also on agenda are plans to build the Agartala-Akhaura railway link as well as expediting assistance to modernise Bangladeshs railway infrastructure. Proposals include modernising a wagon factory in Bangladesh.         
	Bangladesh has also been pushing for a visa-free regime. Indian security agencies are not willing to agree to this proposal as the facility can be misused.        
	The Indian government, however, is looking to relax norms for multiple-entry visas.

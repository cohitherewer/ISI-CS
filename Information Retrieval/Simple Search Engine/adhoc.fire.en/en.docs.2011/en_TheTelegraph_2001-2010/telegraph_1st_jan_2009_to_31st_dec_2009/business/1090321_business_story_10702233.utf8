The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | IOC for equal stake in Reliance deal
                                                                                                               IOC for equal stake in Reliance deal
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Awaiting a white knight                                  
	New Delhi, March 20: Indian Oil Corporation and Royal Dutch Shell have bid to buy 50 per cent of Reliance Industries petrol pump business.        
	Sources said state-owned IOC and Shell had submitted their expressions of interest to Reliances offer for a joint venture to revive its 1,432 pumps, which were closed last year.        
	Officials of IOC and Shell, however, refused to confirm or deny the bids.        
	Reliance has been looking at ways to revive its petrol pumps.         
	Rising oil prices last year had spelt doom for the outlets because Reliance could not compete with PSU refiners such as IOC who sold fuel at subsidised rates.        
	Reliance cannot use fuel from its two refineries at Jamnagar, Gujarat, because they have been converted into export-oriented units.         
	A partnership would ensure that the outlets were never short of fuels.        
	The private refiner had sought expressions of interest as part of a two-stage bidding process.         
	The bidders will now do a due diligence before making a financial proposal, based on which Reliance will choose a partner.        
	Reliance had wanted the bidders to pick up a 26, 50 or 74 per cent stake.         
	Indian Oil preferred equal partnership  it was not interested in being a portfolio investor, which ruled out a stake less than 50 per cent, while a greater equity would have turned the venture into a PSU.        
	For Shell, the partnership would mean ready infrastructure. Reliance has invested Rs 5,000 crore in setting up the retail network.         
	The petrol pumps will add to Shells existing 75-80 outlets.         
	Shell is the only foreign firm with a licence for petrol pumps. It has plans for 2,000 outlets.        
	The Reliance outlets have three business models  company-owned, company-operated; company-owned, dealer-operated; or dealer-owned, dealer-operated.         
	IOC has about 17,600 petrol pumps and a successful joint venture with Reliance will give it a substantial market share.         
	The Reliance outlets score high on location  most of them are on highways  and IOC hopes to sell 4-4.5 million tonnes of fuel annually through them.        
	HPCL and BPCL  the other two PSU refiners  have 8,300 and 6,500 outlets, respectively. IOC, HPCL and BPCL are gaining Rs 4.04 from the sale of a litre of diesel and 33 paise from petrol.        
	After the strike by the officers of state-owned oil companies, led by IOC officials, crippled the supply of petroleum products, the government has been planning to break the monopoly of IOC in retail business.

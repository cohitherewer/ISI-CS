  Two boards to meet on Monday
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                                   
	Mumbai, Feb. 27: Mukesh Ambani is planning another mega merger. On Friday, Reliance Industries announced plans to merge group company Reliance Petroleum Ltd with itself.        
	Notices sent out to the stock exchanges said the boards of the two companies would meet on March 2 to consider a proposal for the amalgamation.        
	The surprise announcement sets up the stage for what will rank among the largest corporate mergers in the country. It will bring the countrys two largest refineries under the overarching umbrella of Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL). In 2002, RIL had merged another group company  coincidentally named Reliance Petroleum  with itself in what was then touted as the biggest merger ever.        
	The coincidences dont end there: the old RPL had been established to build a 27-million-tonne-a-year refinery at Jamnagar, which had since expanded its capacity to 34 million tonnes a year.        
	The new RPL has set up another gigantic refinery with capacity to process 580,000 barrels of crude a day. The refinery, which is the sixth largest in the world, commenced operations last December. The merger will create a refinery monolith that will have capacity to consume close to 1.24 million barrels of crude oil a day.        
	Bargaining power        
	Some experts believe that this alone will give it a good bargaining power, enabling it to source crude at better prices. It is estimated that RILs revenues will swell by around Rs 60,000 crore and its profits by Rs 400 crore during the year ending March 31, 2010.        
	The merger will bring within the RIL fold a refinery that is able to process heavy crude  a feature that none of the other refineries in the country has. Experts were, however, divided on whether the merger would yield tax benefits. Girish Vanvari, director of KPMG, said, RIL will enjoy a tax benefit only if RPL has made losses. In such a scenario, these losses can be set off against RILs profits.        
	Swap ratio        
	The merger will bring a lot of benefits to the shareholders of RIL. Experts say that RPL shareholders can also stand to gain though a lot will depend on the share swap ratio.        
	The announcement comes at a time when crude prices have dipped from around $140 a barrel last July to around $40 per barrel now. The refining business has not been doing well in recent times. For an RPL shareholder, a merger will be good news as he will now be a part of a company that has various businesses, said Deepak Pareek, oil and gas analyst at Angel Broking.        
	Market circles feel the share swap ratio for the proposed merger can lie somewhere between the current market value and the book value. Based on the current market price, the swap ratio is projected at 17 shares of RPL for every share of RIL.         
	Arun Kejriwal, director at KRIS, said the swap ratio could go in favour of RIL shareholders as it will take into account the varied interests of the group flagship and the prospects of a new revenue stream from its gasfields that are expected to go into production in April.        
	Treasury stock        
	RIL has orchestrated several mergers in the past  the most recent being the merger of IPCL with itself. Most of these mergers have generated treasury stock  and experts believe the latest merger will do the same.        
	The treasury stock arises because RIL now holds 70.38 per cent of RPL. A treasury stock is created when the company holds its own stock because of a merger with a group company.

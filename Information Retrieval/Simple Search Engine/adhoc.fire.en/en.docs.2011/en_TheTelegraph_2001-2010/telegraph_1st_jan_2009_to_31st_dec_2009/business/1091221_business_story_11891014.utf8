The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Perks pinch
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Perks pinch
        The new rules on perquisite tax will eat into take-home salaries of individuals, says Subhash Lakhotia                                         
	Salaried individuals enjoying perks, such as chauffeur-driven cars, will take home less now.         
	Employees will now have to pay taxes on perquisites given to them by their employers. The employer would bear the tax so far.         
	The Central Board of Direct Taxes on Friday notified new rules for valuation of perquisites provided by employers to employees. It comes with retrospective effect from April 1, 2009.         
	The fringe benefit tax being paid by employers for offering non-cash benefits, including cars and employee stock options, will be abolished and replaced with a regime that will tax the perquisites in the hands of employees, which would mean less take-home pay for employees.        
	The rules are largely the same as what were prevalent before the introduction of FBT by finance minister P. Chidambaram in 2005, though there are changes in the valuation of cars.         
	On the move        
	Employees provided with cars will now have to pay tax on a monthly valuation of Rs 1,800 for the vehicle and Rs 500 for the chauffeur if the car capacity is less than 1.6 litre.         
	For cars above that category, the valuation will be Rs 2,400 for the vehicle and Rs 900 for the chauffeur, if expenses on maintenance and running are reimbursed by the employer.         
	However, if the employee bears the expenses for running or maintaining the car, then the value assigned to a small car will be Rs 600 per month for a car with engine capacity up to 1.6 litres.         
	In case the cubic capacity exceeds 1.6 litres, the value would be Rs 900 per month or Rs 10,800 per annum.         
	Another Rs 900 per month or Rs 10,800 per annum will be added if the employee has been provided with a chauffeur. The valuation has increased compared with previous perquisite taxation rules. However, no value will be assigned if the expenses incurred on a car is used wholly and exclusively for official purposes.         
	Personal vs official        
	If an employee is provided a car for personal use only, the expenses incurred by the employer on the running and maintenance of the motor car, including the chauffeurs salary, would be added as a perquisite in the hands of an employee.         
	However, if the car is exclusively used for official purposes, the employee wont have to pay any tax, but the employer has to maintain details of journey for official purposes.         
	Further, 10 per cent per annum of the actual cost of the motor car or cars shall be taken as maintenance.        
	For an employee using two or more cars for office and personal use, leaving aside one all other cars would be considered for private use only.        
	More the merrier?        
	Other perquisites provided by employees such as rent-free accommodation, services of personal attendants, concessional education, concessional journeys, interest-free loans, gift vouchers, hotel stay exceeding 15 days and medical facilities, employee stock option plans have become taxable in the hands of employees now.         
	The government has retained the old perquisite valuation rules that were in place prior to the FBT regime, only marginally tinkering with in the case of cars and food vouchers.         
	Gift vouchers up to Rs 5,000 during a year would be outside the purview of being taxed as a perquisite. Meal coupons or free meals would be exempted only up to Rs 50 per meal per employee.        
	With respect to taxing of other benefits like accommodation and employees stock options, the rules remain the same as earlier.         
	The valuation on ESOPs is based on the distinction between shares of listed and unlisted companies.         
	In the case of FBT, employers were paying the tax to the government for giving ESOPs and were recovering it from employees.         
	Now, the employees will directly pay the tax.        
	Home truths        
	The new rule relating to taxation of perquisites clearly states that the perquisite in the form of gas, electric energy, water, provisions of sweeper, gardener or a watchman and a personal attendant would continue to be added as a perquisite of the employee.         
	Similarly for credit cards and club bills. However, if such expenses are incurred wholly and exclusively for performance of official duties then no amount would be added on account of perquisites.         
	The initial fee paid by the company towards corporate membership of the employee in a club would also be outside the scope of perquisite taxation.        
	Tax axe        
	In the new regime, the value assigned to the perk enjoyed by the taxpayer will now be added to his total income and be taxed accordingly, depending on the tax bracket he is in. In fact, some employees could even go up to a higher tax bracket because of this addition of perks to the income.         
	Bundled up        
	This entire tax liability is to be recovered in the remaining three months of the year if employers have not deducted any tax so far.         
	Salaried taxpayers enjoying such perks will see their outgo jumping in the next three months as the government changed the way these perks are valued and lumps their whole year collection to three months.         
	However, since the budget came in July, companies had already paid the first instalment of advance FBT in June. The government will have to clarify whether this FBT would be treated as TDS of employees.        
	An area that requires clarity is the calculation for international workers.

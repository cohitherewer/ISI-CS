The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Proposals short on long-term vision
                                                                                                               Proposals short on long-term vision
										      Guest Column - Rajeev Gupta                         
	Pranab das budget did not reflect the man! Easily one the most thoughtful senior leaders with a rare conviction and a political gumption that has marked his illustrious political career, his budget seemed incremental and not the steep change in construct and scope that was expected.         
	Every successful company needs a business strategy and every successful country needs an economic and social strategy. On the latter, the 2009 budget is commendable in that it affirms the much needed commitment to a deepened social sector spend.         
	What I looked hard in the budget for, but did not find to my disappointment was the implicit economic strategy. The budget was full of proposals like a custom duty reduction here, an excise duty change there but it did not add to a coherent picture of what the countrys economic strategy would be for the next five years.         
	Any observer of the Indian economy can see the following four glaring contradictions abounding in it. I had expected Pranab da to address them directionally and directly to set the economic strategy for the future but for some reason he didnt         
	Indian companies are among most profitable globally (Yes.Its true) but the country has a sizeable trade deficit even if oil imports are excluded. Why dont companies invest in India to serve export markets ?         
	Sixty-five per cent of our populace lives on agriculture and other related occupations. But we also have among the lowest per acre farm productivity in the world. Why is our democracy not responsive to its biggest constituency viz the farmers?         
	Some of our most successful and best governed corporations like HDFC, L amp;T and ICICI have no promoters. They are true institutions, highly respected by peers and loved by investors. But despite these successful role models, the Indian Government is stuck in the rut of insisting on a minimum 51 per cent ownership in PSUs.         
	A key reason for our past economic and professional success has been our meritocratic higher education institutions like IITs and IIMs but the governments recent record in preserving, enhancing and scaling up higher level education institutions is not the most confidence inspiring one.         
	The first budget of the new government should have set the direction to address each of the above four issues. Here is how it could have done so        
	Trade deficit will not be set right by an interest subvention for exporters or a tax concession for them. A very significant part of global trade represents related trade between MNC arms. If we want to be in large trade flows, we will have to invite MNCs to set up production shops here. This requires a facilitation approach, easy approvals and quite honestly deals will have to be offered to them a la Chandrababu Naidu. Our own capital, efficient and capable as it is, will not be able to break into global export flows as easily. Admin reforms would be as powerful a tool here as tax concessions.

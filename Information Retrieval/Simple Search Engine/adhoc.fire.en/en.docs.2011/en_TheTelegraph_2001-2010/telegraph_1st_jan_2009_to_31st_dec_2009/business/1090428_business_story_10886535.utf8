                                                                                                               Norms for pre-paid vouchers
                            
	Mumbai, April 27 (PTI): The Reserve Bank has allowed banks and other entities to issue pre-paid vouchers up to Rs 50,000, which can be used to purchase goods and withdraw cash from ATMs.        
	Maximum value of any pre-paid instrument shall not exceed Rs 50,000, the RBI said. These pre-paid instruments, which include smart cards, magnetic strip cards, Internet accounts to facilitate e-shopping, mobile accounts, mobile wallets and prepaid vouchers, will have a validity period of six months.         
	The mobile payment system allows consumers to use the mobile phone like a wallet. It usually has built-in bank account functions.        
	Banks and NBFCs, which comply with the capital adequacy requirements, and entities having a paid-up capital of Rs 1 crore will be able to issue such instruments. The amount stored in the vouchers will represent the value paid by the holder either in cash or through debit or credit cards.

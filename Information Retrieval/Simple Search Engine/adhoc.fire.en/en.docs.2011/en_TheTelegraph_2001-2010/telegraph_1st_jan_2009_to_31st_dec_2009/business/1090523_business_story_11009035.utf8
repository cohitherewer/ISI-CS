The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Satyam staff face pay cut
                                                                                                               Satyam staff face pay cut
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                                            
	New Delhi, May 22: The board of Satyam Computer Services today discussed salary cuts along with other cost-control measures to arrest a profit slide without laying off the surplus 10,000 workers, which the companys new owner says it has on its rolls.        
	Satyam board chairman Kiran Karnik said the company was not looking at layoffs but at new ways to manage costs, handle people and meet challenges to the bottom line.         
	Sources said new owner Tech Mahindra was planning to change the name and logo of the company. Tech Mahindra took over last month in a government-initiated effort to bail out the firm, which had plunged into chaos when its founder B. Ramalinga Raju admitted to a Rs 7,100-crore fraud in January.        
	Some key global clients of Satyam are learnt to have strongly advised the company to opt for the changes.         
	Analysts said the branding of any company was decided by two factors  visibility and reliability. Satyam as a brand is much more visible than that of Tech Mahindra. However, from the reliability standpoint, the Mahindra company is better placed owing to its clean image and professional management.         
	Tech Mahindra today appointed four nominee directors on Satyams board, including chief executive Vineet Nayar, taking its strength to 10. The new board will take charge from June.        
	Tech Mahindra said Satyam had 10,000 excess employees in its 40,000-strong workforce.         
	Satyam has 10,000 excess manpower. It has close to 40,000 employees. We are looking at least painful ways to take care of this issue, said Vineet Nayyar, CEO, Tech Mahindra, after a meeting with the board members.        
	He said the accounts of Satyam would be restated for the past one year, instead of the preceding six years, enabling it to participate in tenders for projects requiring a proof of financial viability.

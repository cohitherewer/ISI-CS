The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Grupo bid for Asarco in trouble
                                                                                                               Grupo bid for Asarco in trouble
                            
	New Delhi, Oct. 20 (PTI): Grupo Mexicos plan to regain control of bankrupt copper miner Asarco has hit a roadblock. US District Court Judge Andrew S Hanen has indicated he will consider a broad array of issues before ruling in the case, The Wall Street Journal said in a report.        
	Anil Agarwals Sterlite Industries is also in the race to acquire Asarco. Sterlite has made an all-cash offer of $2.56 billion for the copper miner, rivalling Grupo Mexicos bid of about $2.5 billion.        
	The year-long rivalry reached a climax with the US District Court starting the proceedings yesterday.        
	Issues that may be considered by the court include the complaints of union miners opposed to working for their erstwhile Mexican employer, largely for concerns over safety. The judge has been asked to consider Grupos past performance as owner of Asarco. The report said, Asarcos union and court-appointed management prefer Sterlite.        
	Noting that judge Hanen allowed Sterlite to argue for its amended bid, the report said he would consider the unions objections to Grupo Mexico.

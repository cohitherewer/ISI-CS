The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Top insurer ends contract 
                                                                                                               Top insurer ends contract 
                            
	Washington, Jan. 18 (PTI): A Fortune 500 American insurance company has terminated its contract with the scam-tainted Satyam Computer, rendering about 400 of its employees jobless.        
	State Farm Insurance has decided to terminate its contract with Satyam Computer after the scam in the Indian IT company surfaced, according to a report of the daily Pantagraph from Bloomington in Illinois, where the company is headquartered.         
	The contract was terminated on Thursday. The current uncertainties surrounding Satyams future and its potential impact on State Farm resulted in this decision, the newspaper quoted the company as saying.        
	Satyam Computer, the newspaper said, has been a long-term vendor of State Farm and is one of the several vendors which the insurance company uses for this type of IT work.        
	As a result of the termination of the contract, a large number of Satyam employees are likely to return to India because of their visa requirements.         
	However, some of them are likely to stay back if they get a new job and are able to get a work visa.

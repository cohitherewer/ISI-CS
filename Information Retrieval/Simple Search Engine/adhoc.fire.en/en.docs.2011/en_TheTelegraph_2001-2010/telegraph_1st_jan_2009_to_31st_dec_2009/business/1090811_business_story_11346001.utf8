	Calcutta, Aug. 10: The owners of Gujarat NRE Mineral Resource Ltd (GNMRL) have decided to give 1:1 bonus to its non-promoter shareholders.        
	The company is the biggest shareholder of Gujarat NRE Coke Ltd  Indias leading low-ash met coke manufacturer  owning a 34.49 per cent stake. It also possesses a large tract of land in western Australia, which is a potential oil and gas resource.        
	Besides the bonus, the company has proposed a five per cent dividend to all shareholders, including the promoters.        
	Arun Kumar Jagatramka, managing director of GNMRL, said the bonus issue would bring down the promoters holding in the unlisted company to 96 per cent from 98 per cent.         
	There are about 10,000 public shareholders of GNMRL who were offered the shares by the Jagatramka family a few years back for being the stakeholders of Gujarat NRE Coke then. Jagatramka said he would list GNMRL in the next 12-18 months to raise cash to fund oil and gas exploration.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Bharat Sanchar sees big bucks in towers
                                                                                                               Bharat Sanchar sees big bucks in towers
          JAYATI GHOSE                          Lucrative Option                                  
	New Delhi, Oct. 16: State-run Bharat Sanchar Nigam Limited expects to generate Rs 1,000 crore of revenue from infrastructure sharing over the next one year.         
	BSNL is aggressively working towards sharing its infrastructure with existing and new telecom operators. With more than 40,000 towers across the country, BSNL hopes to generate Rs 1,000 crore of revenue within a year from this business, said a senior company executive.        
	The PSU telecom player has entered into an agreement with Videocon-promoted Datacom for sharing infrastructure. Datacom has licences to provide GSM services across the country and plans to launch them in four circles this year.        
	Last month, BSNL signed master services agreements with Aircel and Tata Teleservices for the sharing of towers.         
	The sharing agreement gives private telecom firms access to more than 42,000 BSNL towers across the country (except Delhi amp; Mumbai). It also helps mobile firms to speed up network rollout and save costs.        
	Analysts said BSNLs aggressive foray into the infrastructure space could set alarm bells ringing among private players as the PSUs network reach within the country, especially in the rural and remote areas, is vast.         
	Indus Towers, a joint venture floated by Bharti Airtel, Vodafone Essar and Idea Cellular, is the largest tower firm in the country with at least 100,000 towers.        
	BSNL has a strong nationwide coverage and offers the best value proposition in the Indian telecom market. Our objective is to provide quality and reliable service, said Kuldeep Goyal, chairman and managing director of BSNL.        
	BSNL recently shelved its plans to hive off its tower and other related infrastructure into a separate company as it felt it would be difficult to unlock value.        
	Indian telecom providers have been increasingly outsourcing their IT infrastructure as it will enable them to concentrate on their core competencies.         
	The trend was started by Bharti-Airtel when it inked a deal with IBM.        
	Recently, Datacom Solutions awarded a Rs 2,000-crore tower-sharing contract to Aircel Cellular.         
	Under the agreement, spread over a 16-month period, Datacom will get access to 5,000 of Aircels towers across various circles.        
	Wipro has also won a Rs 2,500-crore deal from Unitech Wireless. In January 2008, Aircel awarded a $600-million contract to Wipro.

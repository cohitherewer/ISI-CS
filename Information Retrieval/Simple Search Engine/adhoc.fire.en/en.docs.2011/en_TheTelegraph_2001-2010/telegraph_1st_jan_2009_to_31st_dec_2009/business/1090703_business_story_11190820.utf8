          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Rough ride                                  
	Mumbai, July 2: The government has given Air India a month to submit its revival plan.         
	The cash-strapped national carrier has appointed SBI Capital Markets as the consultant to prepare the plan, aviation minister Praful Patel told reporters today.        
	He said the airline should not take the governments support for granted.         
	It cannot be open-ended. The government is committed. We want a strong national carrier.         
	Though Air India officials declined to comment, it is learnt that the plan is likely to focus on cutting costs.         
	Patel said he hoped that the airline would respond quickly and the management and employees would jointly come out with the plan.        
	The borrowings of Air India have more than doubled to Rs 15,241 crore in June from Rs 6,550 crore in November 2007.         
	The sharp rise in borrowings was because of new aircraft purchases and mounting operating losses.         
	The minister also made it clear that there was no plan to retrench any Air India employee.         
	The employees, meanwhile, have decided to boycott work for two hours tomorrow from 1pm to 3pm to protest a delay in salary payment. The management has threatened action.        
	Unconfirmed reports say that the employees in the lower grades are unlikely to get their salaries tomorrow.         
	Last month, the management had agreed to pay salaries to its lower grade employees by July 3.        
	The Air India board met here today to discuss the companys health amid the 30-day deadline of the government to submit the revival plan.

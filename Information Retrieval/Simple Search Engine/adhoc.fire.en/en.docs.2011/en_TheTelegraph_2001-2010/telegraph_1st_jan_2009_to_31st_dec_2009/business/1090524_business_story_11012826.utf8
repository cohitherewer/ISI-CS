The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Govt sets ball rolling for full budget 
                                                                                                               Govt sets ball rolling for full budget 
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Pranab Mukherjee in New Delhi on Saturday. (PTI)                                  
	New Delhi, May 23: The Congress-led government plans to pass a full budget by the end of July.         
	Newly appointed finance minister Pranab Mukherjee is expected to come up with a budget within the next 45 days, a task which finance ministry officials said would not be difficult, given the level of preparedness and the groundwork that Mukherjee had asked them to carry out as the interim finance minister.         
	Soon after the allocation of portfolios, Mukherjee said, We shall have to build up and come back to the growth track as early as possible.        
	We will be able to, I hope, present the budget in due time so that uncertainties can be avoided and time of spending can be renewed, he said.        
	P. Chidambaram, who retained the home portfolio and briefed the press after todays cabinet meeting, said if it was not possible to pass the budget within July, the government would take a call on another vote on account for a brief period.        
	The central government had presented an interim budget in February to get parliamentary approval for expenses till July 31 and left it to the new government to present a formal budget.        
	Before the elections, the government had said stimulus of at least another 1 per cent of gross domestic product was needed to arrest the current slowdown in the economy which saw industry and exports shrinking for several months last year.        
	Mukherjee, who takes on the job at a time when India is trying to battle the global economic recession, is considered a deliverer by most bureaucrats and industrialists. He was tasked by Manmohan Singh to head most of the contentious group of ministers set up to resolve squabbles between ministries.         
	The 73-year-old Congress party veteran has had a stint as finance minister earlier in 1982-84 when he brought about several fiscal reforms and freed Indias exporters, bringing in vital foreign exchange.         
	He saw to it that India did not need to pick up the last $1.1 billion instalment of an IMF loan it had contracted earlier ... this was the first signs of Indias resurgence, said a finance ministry official.        
	Besides a stimulus package that could focus on tax breaks for select sectors and a massive spending plan for infrastructure, Mukherjees first budget could include an expanded rural employment guarantee scheme designed to create fresh jobs and focus on food security for the poor.         
	The rural job scheme will be extended to urban areas and the poor will get cheap grains as part of the scheme.         
	However tax breaks and spending plans will have to factor in the harsh reality that government finances are not exactly in a rosy situation.         
	Mukherjee may also push through unfinished reforms, albeit selectively.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Bharti-MTN deal talks flop
                                                                                                               Bharti-MTN deal talks flop
          OUR BUREAU                                            
	Sept. 30: The four-month tango between Bharti Airtel and MTN of South Africa ended today as the two sides failed to resolve the wrangle over the dual listing of shares of a $20-billion telecom behemoth created out of the merger of the two telecom giants.        
	The talks floundered over South Africas insistence that the shares list on the Johannesburg stock exchange as well  a precondition that could not be met because Indian regulations did not allow it as the rupee was not a freely convertible currency.        
	If they had pulled it off, the $23-billion transaction would have ranked as the biggest cross-border deal this year.        
	This is the second time that talks on a merger between the two telecom players have come unstuck. In May 2008, Bharti and MTN broke off discussions over the issue of control. This time the dual listing condition proved to be the deal-breaker.        
	This structure needed an approval from the government of South Africa, which has expressed its inability to accept it in the current form. In view of this, both companies have taken the decision to disengage from discussion, Bharti Airtel said in a statement.        
	MTN did not issue a formal statement till late tonight.        
	Sunil Mittal-promoted Bharti Airtel, however, kept the door open for the resumption of dialogue  more in hope than belief.         
	Bharti has enjoyed its engagement with the MTN management and its board; and wishes them continued success. We hope the South African government will review its position in the future and allow both companies an opportunity to re-engage, it said.        
	Bharti and MTN have been in exclusive discussions since May 25 to discuss the contours of an alliance that could potentially create the worlds third-biggest mobile-phone company.        
	Deal terms        
	Under the initial plan unveiled in May, Bharti would be the biggest single stakeholder in the new entity, taking a 49 per cent stake in MTN using cash and Global Depository Receipts (GDRs).        
	On the other hand, MTN was scheduled to acquire a 25 per cent stake in Bharti for $2.9 billion in cash plus new MTN shares. In addition, MTN shareholders were supposed to receive another 11 per cent in Bharti Airtel, which could have given MTN a combined economic interest of 36 per cent in the Rs 34,155-crore Indian telecom company.        
	The exclusivity talks between the two sides had been extended twice and, as the late evening deadline for the closure of the deal loomed, there was speculation that it might be extended again.        
	But that wasnt to be.        
	Early in the day, talk from two prominent ministers  one in South Africa and the other in India  didnt inspire confidence that the two sides would be able to work around a thicket of sensitive issues that had arisen in the past few weeks and threatened to scupper the deal.         
	In the morning, South Africas communications minister Siphiwe Nyanda told reporters in Johnannesburg that MTN would have to remain a South African company. Its management must remain South African. We are waiting for results of the discussions, he added.        
	In Delhi, Salman Khurshid, minister for corporate affairs, reiterated that there were no guidelines for the dual listing of shares of Indian entities  a regulatory hurdle that had always threatened to derail the talks amid growing concerns in Johannesburg over the ownership of the new telecom giant.        
	Sources said that at a meeting between regulators and MTN officials today the South African government had insisted that India should amend its laws to allow dual-listed companies.        
	These arrangements are designed to protect the companies national identities.        
	However, the Indian government had made it clear that laws could not be amended to accommodate the demand.        
	Stock to surge        
	The breakdown in the merger talks may have come as a huge disappointment for those who wanted to see an Indian entity spearhead a global telecom player, but market mavens expect the Bharti Airtel stock to soar tomorrow.

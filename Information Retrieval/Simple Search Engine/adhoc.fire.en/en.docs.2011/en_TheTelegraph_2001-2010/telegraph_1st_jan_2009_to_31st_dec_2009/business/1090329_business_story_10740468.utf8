	 New Delhi, March 28: The government is likely to undertake a special audit of integrated telecom companies, including Bharti Airtel. The companies are facing allegations of reporting revenues in a manner that attracts lower licence fee. Communications and IT minister A. Raja has asked the department of telecom to examine any case of revenue loss for the exchequer caused by private telecom operators such as Bharti Airtel, Vodafone, Idea and Aircel.                            
	 Mumbai, March 28: The countrys forex reserves went up to $253.83 billion for the week ended March 20, up $5.1 billion, compared with $248.72 billion in the previous week. The jump in reserves was primarily because of a $5-billion increase in foreign currency assets, which rose to $243.23 billion during the week from $238.16 billion in the previous week, the Reserve Bank of India said in its weekly report.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Auto firms seen in top gear
                                                                                                               Auto firms seen in top gear
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                           
	Mumbai, Oct. 11: Brokerages are expecting the automobile and capital goods industries to do well in the second quarter.         
	They are also upbeat on cement, but the slowdown in the Indian economy means the forecast is sedate for banking, metals, pharmaceuticals, FMCG and oil and gas.        
	Automobiles will outshine others on the back of strong sales and higher profit.         
	Low interest rates, better credit availability and improved customer sentiment provided a boost to sales. Profits will also be healthy as raw material prices remained soft.         
	We expect Sharekhans auto universe to register a strong topline growth of 35.5 per cent and a stupendous bottomline growth of 82 per cent year-on-year. The operating profit margin is expected to grow significantly by 418 basis points, says a report by the brokerage.         
	Angel Broking predicts robust growth for most automobile companies in the second quarter. Commodity prices have fallen from their peak in 2008-09, and the benefits should be realised now, the brokerage said.        
	The forecast is good for cement, notwithstanding the rain. Analysts say a double-digit growth in despatches in July and August may help the sector to report better year-on-year numbers, at least in terms of volumes.         
	Edelweiss, however, sees a subdued quarter for the industry because of lower realisations and less volumes.         
	Religare Hichens Harrison, on the other hand, says net profits will jump around 30 per cent.         
	In capital goods, the topline is likely to show a growth of 16-19 per cent powered by the healthy order books of Bhel and Larsen amp; Toubro.         
	We believe Q2 of 2009-10 will signal a shift in order accretion. Revenue growth in second quarter is likely to be higher than the first quarter across the sector as the easing of liquidity is likely to have impacted execution positively, Edelweiss said.         
	Slow pace        
	Volume growth will ensure a modest second quarter for FMCG, while the outlook on metals is mixed. Though the industry may see higher volumes, lower realisations can hit the topline.         
	The forecast for oil and gas sector is also not optimistic. Religare expects revenues to decelerate 22.7 per cent year-on-year because of a fall in crude prices.         
	Banks are not expected to fare well, with credit growth remaining low at around 14 per cent during the quarter. Profits from treasury operations are expected to take a hit.

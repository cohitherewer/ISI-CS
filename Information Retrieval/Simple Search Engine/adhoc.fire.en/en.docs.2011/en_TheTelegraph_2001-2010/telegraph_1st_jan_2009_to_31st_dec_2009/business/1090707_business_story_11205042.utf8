	The backdrop to the first budget for the newly re-elected UPA government has been to address the challenge to lead economy to a high growth of 9 per cent, deepen the agenda for inclusive development of the country and improve delivery mechanism. Continuing the process of tax reform to address these challenges and garner higher tax revenues was like a tightrope walk for the finance minister. Mukherjee and his team need to be applauded for paving a road to the structural changes through various tax proposals of the Union budget 2009-10.        
	While, corporate tax rates remain unchanged, the proposed abolishing of fringe benefit tax (FBT) provides savings of around 3-5 per cent on profit before tax plus administration costs. The extension of tax holiday on exports by one year under sections 10A and 10B up to 2010-11, along with correction in formula anomaly on SEZ tax holiday is a welcome relief to the exporters battling the recession. However, 5 per cent increase in the minimum alternate tax will have a counter effect with an additional cash outlay.         
	The individual tax payers have some respite with the increase in the basic exemption limits by Rs 10,000 to Rs 15,000, reduction in surcharge by 10 per cent on personal income-tax (and thus effective tax savings of around 3 per cent) and enhancement in wealth tax threshold limit to 30 lakhs from Rs 15 lakhs.         
	However, the removal of FBT on employers will shift the tax incidence on Esops to the employees. An early introduction of popular Saral-II tax forms is also envisaged.        
	The indirect tax proposals seek to achieve a stable framework by maintaining overall rate structure for customs, excise and service tax.         
	The current excise duty rate of 4 per cent on certain products has been increased to 8 per cent to address the inverted duty structures.         
	Foreign companies would be happy to note that an alternate dispute resolution mechanism is being created to resolve contentious transfer pricing issues and corporate tax disputes with an added hope of proposed safe harbour rules for transfer pricing.        
	The tax proposals are forward looking with a promise for further rationalisation and simplification, improved tax administration using automation, consultative approach to the new direct tax code to be released within next 45 days.                                      
	 and the commitment to introduce goods and services tax with effect from 1 April 2010.              THE AUTHOR IS TAX PARTNER, ERNST AMP; YOUNG, INDIA

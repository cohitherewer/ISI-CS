                                                                                                               Deposits of SBI lose gloss
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                            
	Mumbai, May 13: The State Bank of India, the countrys largest bank, today slashed its deposit rates across maturities by up to 50 basis points. The cuts come into effect from May 18.         
	This is the third time in the past 40 days that the SBI has trimmed its deposit rates. The first rate cut was on April 13 when the bank lowered deposit rates by 25 to 50 basis points. One basis point is one hundredth of a percentage point.         
	Later, on May 2, the SBI had cut interest rates on all deposits by 25 basis points.         
	After todays rate cut, the bank will pay interest at 7.25 per cent on deposits that mature between one year and less than two years, against 7.5 per cent earlier. Deposits with a tenure of 181 days to less than a year will now offer a rate of 6.5 per cent (against 6.75 per cent earlier). Deposits of 1000-day tenure will carry a rate of 7.75 per cent (8 per cent).        
	Similarly, deposits of two years to less than 1000 days and 91 days to 180 days will now offer rates of 7.5 per cent (7.75 per cent) and 5.5 per cent (6 per cent), respectively.         
	The rate for deposits with a tenure of three years to less than five years has been revised to 7.5 per cent (7.75 per cent), the bank said.        
	More rate cuts likely        
	The SBI revisions are likely to trigger another round of interest rate cuts in the banking industry.        
	Industry sources said ICICI Bank  the countrys second largest commercial bank  was likely to follow suit, especially after the Reserve Bank of India had been trying to nudge banks to trim their lending rates. An ICICI Bank spokesperson, however, declined to comment.         
	Banks are looking to trim their deposit rates first before slashing their lending rates to bring down their own cost of funds.        
	Flush with funds        
	SBI chairman .P. Bhatt had hinted last week that the bank would review interest rates by the end of the month.        
	The bank has been receiving strong deposit flows in the past year. Bhatt had indicated that the SBI had been receiving deposits of almost Rs 1,000 crore every day, leading to a sharp increase in its interest liabilities.

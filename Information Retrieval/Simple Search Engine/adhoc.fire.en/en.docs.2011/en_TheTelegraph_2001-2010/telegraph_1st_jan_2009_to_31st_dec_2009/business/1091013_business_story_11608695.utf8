The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Global steel demand on the mend
                                                                                                               Global steel demand on the mend
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                            
	Calcutta, Oct. 12: The World Steel Association (WSA) has predicted global steel use to fall 8.6 per cent in 2009, lower than its April estimate of a 14.1 per cent decline.        
	The revised forecast underlines a revival in demand for the metal, a key indicator of global industrial health. In India, consumption will grow 8.9 per cent this year and 12.1 per cent in 2010.        
	According to the WSA, the worst is over for the industry. Demand will rebound in the US, Europe and Japan, with world consumption expected to grow 9.2 per cent next year.        
	The turnaround in demand is attributed to exceptionally strong growth in China, the WSA said today.        
	Apparent steel use, which excludes inventories, is expected to increase 18.8 per cent to 526 million tonnes in China. The country is expected to account for 47.7 per cent of apparent steel use globally. Barring China, potential world steel use would have fallen 24.4 per cent.        
	The recovery signs augur well for Indian companies that are coming out with strong production numbers in recent months.         
	Tata Steel and JSW, which have operations in Europe and the US, respectively, will also benefit from the recovery.

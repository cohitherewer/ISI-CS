The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Oil subsidy revamp on way
                                                                                                               Oil subsidy revamp on way
          VIVEK NAIR                           Shared burden                                  
	Mumbai, Aug. 30: The government will shortly come out with a transparent and equitable mechanism for subsidy sharing among state-owned oil companies.         
	The revised scheme will come as a big relief for companies such as Oil and Natural Gas Corporation, which has been groaning under an iniquitous system that forced it to fork out Rs 28,225 crore by way of subsidies last year to oil marketing companies such as Indian Oil Corporation to compensate them for the losses they suffer by selling petrol, diesel, kerosene and LPG at government-mandated prices that are lower than cost.         
	The subsidy bailout had hit ONGC hard, which claimed that its net profit was crimped by over Rs 15,000 crore in 2008-09.         
	The government is trying to work out a transparent formula, which will determine how the subsidy should be apportioned among the upstream and marketing companies. We have been trying to lower the burden on the upstream sector, said P.K. Sinha, additional secretary in the ministry of petroleum and natural gas.         
	Under the existing system, upstream oil companies, including ONGC, OIL India Ltd and GAIL (India) Ltd, bear the burden for the under-realisation by the oil marketing companies (OMCs) on the sales of petrol and diesel.         
	The under-realisations occur as the prices of petrol, diesel and LPG are capped by the government below the international selling price.         
	The subsidy burden, which is shared based on the previous years profits, is implemented through a discount on crude oil sale prices to the downstream companies.         
	The OMCs include Indian Oil Corporation, Bharat Petroleum Corporation and Hindustan Petroleum Corporation. The government also meets a part of the burden by issuing oil bonds to the OMCs.         
	The policy on subsidy sharing has come under fire over the past few years with observers pointing out that the practice is not only ad hoc but also lacks transparency.         
	The government, which has a 74.14 per cent stake in ONGC, has taken cash from the upstream oil major for six years to cushion losses at the state-run refiners  a practice that Goldman Sachs had denounced last year as an instance of poor corporate governance since the minority shareholders were not consulted.         
	Industry mavens say it is too early to say what the new formula will be but reckon that upstream companies may have to bear around 30 per cent of the gross under-recoveries of the OMCs.

	New Delhi, March 15 (PTI): State-owned oil firms have raised the price of aviation turbine fuel (ATF) marginally by Rs 158 per kilolitre on an average.        
	ATF will cost Rs 27,275 per kl in Delhi from midnight tonight against Rs 27,106 per kl, an Indian Oil Corporation official said.        
	The PSU oil firms had reduced jet fuel prices 11 times since September last year. The prices were raised 3.3 per cent only once on January 16.         
	In Mumbai ATF rates have been increased to Rs 28,023 per kl from Rs 27,861 per kl.        
	The hike in jet fuel prices will vary from airport to airport, depending on local taxes and levies.        
	ATF prices had peaked to Rs 71,028.26 per kl (in Delhi) in August as international crude price touched a historic high of $147 a barrel. Since then, they have been slashed every month till October and twice in November.

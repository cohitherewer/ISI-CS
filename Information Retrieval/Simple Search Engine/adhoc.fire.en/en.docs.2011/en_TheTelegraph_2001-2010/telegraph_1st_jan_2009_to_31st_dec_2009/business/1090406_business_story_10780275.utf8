The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Sop plea for new firm type
                                                                                                               Sop plea for new firm type
                            
	New Delhi, April 5 (PTI): The corporate affairs ministry has suggested to the finance ministry that companies should be given tax incentives for changing to a new limited liability structure. The move is expected to encourage companies to embrace the new corporate form.         
	Existing companies can convert into limited liability partnerships (LLP), a new corporate structure that came into effect from April this year. Under the new structure, there will be no limit on the number of partners, and the liabilities will be in proportion to the stakes held by them in the entity.        
	The corporate affairs ministry has requested the finance ministry to exempt such firms from capital gains tax. The parliamentary standing committee on finance had recommended a tax-neutral approach for converting an existing company (into an) LLP. We think it will encourage firms (to convert into an LLP), a source said.

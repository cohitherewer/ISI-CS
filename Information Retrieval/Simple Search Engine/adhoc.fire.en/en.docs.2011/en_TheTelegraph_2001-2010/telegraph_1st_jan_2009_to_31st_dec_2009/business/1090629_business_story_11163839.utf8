                                                                                                                 Q amp;A      Senior worry
                                I am an 80-year-old pensioner. My total income is more than the income tax exemption limit. My income from pension, including arrears, will be more than Rs 2.25 lakh in financial year 2009-10. Will the bank, disbursing pension on behalf of the government, deduct tax at source? I want to gift a sum of Rs 1.5-Rs 2 lakh to my wife for buying some consumer durable goods. What are the tax implications?          Kushal Saha, Behala
                    While the banks disburse pension of government employees, they dont deduct tax at source. Pension is taxable. The tax has to be deducted at source by the employer or it has to be paid by you. Gifting money to wife is not a good idea. Instead, you can gift the article to your wife.                                  Clause deleted      I am a senior citizen and my income tax liability in the last three years was zero. I have been submitting tax return every year. I have a house, a telephone, a car and credit cards. My income tax for the assessment year 2009-10 was zero. Do I have to file tax return again this year?        Santanu Sanyal, Salt Lake
                      A nil tax liability doesnt mean that you dont have to file returns. However, you no longer need to file tax return because you own a house or a car or a telephone or a credit card. This provision has long been withdrawn.                                      Fixed fact      I draw a pension of Rs 4,700 per month. I have invested Rs 9 lakh in an FD with Allahabad Bank. The FD will fetch me an annual interest of Rs 50,000. I have also submitted Form 15H. Shall I have to file tax return? What is the limit on interest above which a bank can deduct tax at source?        Kalyan Bhowmick, Nadia
                    You dont have to file tax return as your annual income is much less than the threshold limit of Rs 2.25 lakh. If your interest income from your various accounts in a bank is more than Rs 10,000 a year, the bank will deduct tax at the rate of 10 per cent at source. For non-deduction, you shall have to submit Form 15H with the bank at the beginning of every financial year, that is, before April 10.                        If you have any queries about investing or taxes or a high-cost purchase you are planning, mail to: btgraphabpmail.com, or write to: Business Telegraph, 6 Prafulla Sarkar Street, Calcutta 700 001.                            income tax assessee will have to file income tax return if the total annual income exceeds the basic exemption limit. An individual may not have tax liability after availing the deductions under different sections of the income tax act.

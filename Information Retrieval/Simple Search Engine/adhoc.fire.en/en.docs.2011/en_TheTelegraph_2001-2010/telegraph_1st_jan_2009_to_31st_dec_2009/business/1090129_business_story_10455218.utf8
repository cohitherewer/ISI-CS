	New Delhi, Jan. 28: Toyota Kirloskar Motor  which had cut output by 30 per cent in November and December  is hopeful of resuming normal production from March.

	Toyota, which operates in India through a joint venture with the Kirloskar group, has been producing about 3,000 units per month since November because of a slowdown in the automobile market.

	We are facing a difficult period in the domestic market, and it will continue for the next couple of months. It is expected that the market will grow again from the second half of the year, Nakagawa said.         
	By March we hope the market should start improving and so would our production, he said.        
	Toyota had aimed to sell 60,000 units in 2008, but sold 51,803, said Sandeep Singh, deputy managing director (marketing), Toyota Kirloskar. We are targeting to sell 54,600 units this year, he said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Focus on growth in a balanced exercise
                                                                                                               Focus on growth in a balanced exercise
										      Guest Column - Motilal Oswal                         
	Overall, the Union Budget 2008-09 is a balanced one. The stock markets however, have taken it negatively as there were huge expectations built on union finance minister Pranab Mukherjee.        
	The Street felt that there will be some pro-reform measures like foreign direct investment (FDI) being allowed in some sectors like retail. There were hopes of banking sector reforms as well.         
	Moreover, it was felt that the securities transaction tax (STT) and even the dividend distribution tax could be done away with.         
	But to be fair to the Union finance minister, given the current circumstances, the budget focussed on growth, infrastructure and the rural economy.        
	There were various positive proposals in the budget. For instance, Pranab Mukherjee has tried to put more money into the hands of the common man by doing away with the surcharge on personal income tax.         
	He has thus tried to give a push to consumption.        
	Though various concerns have been expressed about the countrys fiscal situation, at this stage, what is more important is growth of the economy.        
	If there were some welcome features on the personal income tax front, on the corporate front too, there are various positives. The removal of fringe benefit tax (FBT) for example is a very good measure. Further, the finance minister has laid out the road map to facilitate the introduction of goods and service tax (GST) by April 1, 2010.        
	Though increase in the rate of minimum alternate tax (MAT) from 10 to 15 per cent of a companys book profits is a negative, I would still call Pranab Mukherjees exercise as a short and a crisp one.        
	Though the stock markets had huge expectations from the budget, its not necessary that all the reform measures should be undertaken in the budget itself. Many can be done even after the budget.

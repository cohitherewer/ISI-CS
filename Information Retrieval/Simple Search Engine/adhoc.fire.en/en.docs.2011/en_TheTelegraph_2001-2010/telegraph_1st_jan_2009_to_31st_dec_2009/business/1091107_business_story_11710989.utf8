          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Nov. 6: Workers at Rico Auto Industries have called off their nearly two-month-long strike after an agreement was struck with the management on the reinstatement of some employees.        
	The strike at Rico Auto affected Maruti Suzuki India and Hero Honda  the countrys largest car and motorcycle manufacturers, respectively. It also impacted supplies to major foreign auto firms such as Ford Motor and General Motors that have, reportedly, shut down their North American plants. Rico Auto, which manufactures disc brakes and clutches, also supplies to two-wheeler makers such as Honda, Suzuki and Bajaj.        
	The agitation began last month when an employee died in a clash between two groups of workers.        
	According to the agreement thrashed out yesterday, the management has agreed to revoke the suspension on eight of the 16 workers. One worker will be taken back after a month, said Surinder Singh Chaudhary, senior vice-president (HR corporate) of Rico Auto. The workers called off the strike late last evening.        
	Seven workers who indulged in indiscipline will be investigated by Haryanas labour department and action will be taken accordingly, Chaudhary said. He said incentives and salary hike would be decided after comparisons with other leading firms in and around the Gurgaon-Manesar belt.

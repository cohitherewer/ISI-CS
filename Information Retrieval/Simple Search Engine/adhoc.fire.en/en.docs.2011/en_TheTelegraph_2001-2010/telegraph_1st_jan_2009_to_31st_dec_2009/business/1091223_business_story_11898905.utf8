          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Mumbai, Dec. 22: Brokers at the Bombay Stock Exchange continue to oppose the proposal to advance market timings to 9 am.         
	After forcing the bourses to defer the introduction of the new timings till January 4, the brokers today urged the BSE to reconsider its decision to start trading earlier in the day when the overwhelming view on the Street was that it wouldnt yield any real gains.        
	The management committee of the BSE Brokers Forum, which represents interests of the broking community, met today to discuss the proposed change in market timings.        
	The committee unanimously reiterated its strong reservations to the proposal to advance market timings  a view that it had presented before the Securities and Exchange Board of India in April. The forum said there would be no clear benefit to any of the market participants  stakeholders, institutions or retail investors.        
	This has been reaffirmed by 79 per cent of the trading members of the BSE in a survey conducted by the BSE Brokers Forum in November. It is noteworthy that no sections of the markets have demanded any such move and there is no consensus on the matter, it said.        
	The forum said it had asked both the exchanges to take into consideration the ill effects of the early opening at 9 am on the market participants and investors at large.

                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      DP World to keep its word
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Calcutta, Nov. 30: DP World, one of the worlds biggest port operators, today reiterated that the troubles at its parent Dubai World would not come in the way of implementing its projects in India, including those in Bengal and Kerala.        
	The company plans to start work on a container terminal in Cochin in the first quarter of 2010 and begin construction of the Bengal port once the approvals are in place.        
	DP World stands committed to all its projects in India, a company official said today.        
	In Cochin, the Dubai World Terminal will replace an older terminal. The new terminal will initially handle 1 million TEUs (twenty foot equivalent unit) of cargoes a year and expand to 3 million TEUs.        
	DP World and the Cochin Port Trust are investing around Rs 3,000 crore in the facility, which will be a point of transit.        
	The existing terminal handles 270,000 TEUs. Apart from cargoes for Cochin, the new terminal will be a junction for eastern and western sea routes. DP World now runs terminals in Chennai, Visakhapatnam, Mundra in Gujarat and Nava Sheva in Mumbai.        
	The company official sought to allay fears on the consequences of Dubai Worlds debt problems.         
	Dubai World has clearly mentioned that DP World is not part of the restructuring. DP World is a profit making company, the official said.

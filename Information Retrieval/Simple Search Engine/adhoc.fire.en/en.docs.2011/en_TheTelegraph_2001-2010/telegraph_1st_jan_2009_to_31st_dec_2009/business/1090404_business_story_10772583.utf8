	Calcutta, April 3: PSU firms are braving the recession to buy coal assets overseas. The possibility of cheap valuation is encouraging them to go for these acquisitions. International Coal Ventures Ltd (ICVL)  a special purpose vehicle (SPV) jointly floated by five PSUs  is close to acquiring a mine in Mozambique.         
	ICVL comprises Steel Authority of India Limited, Rashtriya Ispat Nigam Limited, National Mineral Development Corporation, National Thermal Power Corporation and Coal India Limited.        
	We have identified a few coal mines in Mozambique and hope to zero in on one to be bought soon, Coal India Ltd chairman and managing director Partha S. Bhattacharyya said. He declined to name the mines.        
	In January, ICVL officials said that it had identified 20 properties in the US, Canada, Australia, Indonesia, South Africa and Mozambique. ICVL would bid for 6-8 properties from the 20 in the next 2 months.        
	ICVL was floated in 2007 amidst an imminent coal shortage of around 200 million tonnes. It was to look out for overseas mining stakes. The SPV has an authorised capital of Rs 3,500 crore.         
	Coal India today has assured the supply of 313 million tonnes of the fuel to power firms under a long-term contract for 2009-10, according to PTI.

                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Govt wants SEC to spare Satyam
          OUR BUREAU                              
	Calcutta, Dec. 15: The government has requested the US Securities Exchange Commission (SEC) not to impose a fine on Satyam  now Mahindra Satyam  as it would impede its rehabilitation process.        
	We have urged the SEC that there should be no penalties imposed on Satyam as it will ultimately fall on the shareholders, minister of state for corporate affairs Salman Khursheed said.        
	Satyam has been put back on its feet within 100 days after the government-appointed new board took over. At least 12 class action lawsuits were filed in the US against the firm. Imposition of penalty would deter the process of rehabilitation that has already begun in a creative manner, he said.        
	He said the Centre had reached the SEC through Sebi, which has an agreement with the US regulator. But, we do not know whether Sebi has got the information on the penalty. We are in touch with the US government, but the SEC is an autonomous body, he said.         
	He said in the US, there was a system of imposing penalties on defaulting firms.        
	Meanwhile, the CBI has filed a chargesheet against Satyam founder B. Ramalinga Raju, his brother Rama Raju and eight others for creating fictitious customers and siphoning off Rs 430 crore from the firm.

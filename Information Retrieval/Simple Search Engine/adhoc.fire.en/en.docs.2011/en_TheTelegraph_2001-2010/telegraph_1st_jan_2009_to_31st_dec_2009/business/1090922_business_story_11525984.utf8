The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Bajaj firm on the prowl 
                                                                                                               Bajaj firm on the prowl 
          SOUNAK MITRA                              
	Calcutta, Sept. 21: Bajaj Electricals Ltd  a subsidiary of the Bajaj group  is on the lookout for brands with a proper distribution network in Europe. The company is willing to spend Rs 100 crore.        
	We are in talks with a few such companies, both in Europe and India. But, nothing has been finalised yet, Bajaj Electricals chairman and MD Sekhar Bajaj told The Telegraph.         
	The company has a sizeable presence in western Asia, and it does not make sense to acquire smaller brands in that region.         
	US would be far away for us to operate. Europe is the right place and there are a few very good brands, he said on the sidelines of the annual general meeting of the Indian Fan Manufacturers Association here today.         
	In March, Bajaj Electricals had tied up with Germany-based Trilux GmbH amp; Co to export luminaries and lighting products to Germany and Europe. The products with a medium to low-end positioning are sold under the Bajaj brand.         
	Bajaj expects a turnover of Rs 2,200 crore in 2009-10 against Rs 1,776 crore a year ago.         
	We are betting big on the Rajiv Gandhi Grameen Vidyutikaran Yojana. The firm has bagged a Rs 360-crore order and another Rs 200 crore is in the pipeline, he said.         
	Nearly five lakh BPL homes are to be covered under the programme in Orissa, Jharkhand, Chhattisgarh and Bengal.

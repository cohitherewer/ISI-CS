                                                                                                               US cash for Sterlite power 
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                        Agarwal: Fund fillip                                  
	Mumbai, July 16: Sterlite Industries (India), the countrys largest copper producer, has raised $1.5 billion through an issue of American Depositary Shares (ADS) and intends to plough that money into power projects in the country.        
	The Anil Agarwal-owned company priced the issue at $12.15 per ADS.        
	Sterlite offered 123,456,790 new equity shares in the form of the ADS, which will be listed on the New York Stock Exchange.         
	Part of the proceeds will also be earmarked for capital expenditure in existing projects and potential acquisitions.        
	A press statement from the non-ferrous metals and mining company said, Vedanta Resources Plc, the majority shareholder of Sterlite, had participated in the offering with an allocation of shares worth $500 million, either directly or through a subsidiary.        
	However, Vedantas shareholding in Sterlite is expected to come down to 57.5 per cent. Vedanta holds close to 62 per cent in Sterlite at present.        
	In its prospectus filed with the US Securities and Exchange Commission, Sterlite said its wholly owned subsidiary Sterlite Energy was investing around Rs 8,200 crore ($1.68 billion) to build a 2,400MW coal-based power facility, comprising four units of 600MW each, at Jharsuguda in Orissa.        
	The project is likely to be commissioned by the third quarter of fiscal 2010. It will become fully operational by the second quarter of fiscal 2011.        
	Sterlite Energy has also won a bid to build a 1,980MW coal-based commercial power plant at Talwandi Sabo in Punjab. The project is likely to be ready by April 2013.        
	Anil Agarwal has ambitious plans in power. The group aims to create a generation capacity of around 12,000MW.         
	This is the second time that Sterlite is raising funds through an ADS issue. It had earlier raised $2 billion in 2007.         
	However, the Sterlite scrip tumbled 6.1 per cent to close at Rs 590.15 on concerns about Vedantas equity dilution.        
	Sterlite has said it plans to expand its businesses by either finishing the existing expansion plans or setting up new projects .        
	Sterlite ranks among the worlds top 15 copper smelters, and it is the largest in India in production volumes.         
	It is also present in the zinc business through Hindustan Zinc in which it has an ownership interest of nearly 65 per cent.

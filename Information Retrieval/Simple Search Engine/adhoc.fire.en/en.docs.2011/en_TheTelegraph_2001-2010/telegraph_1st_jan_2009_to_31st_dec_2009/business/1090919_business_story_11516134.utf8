The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Insurance awaits IPO cue
                                                                                                               Insurance awaits IPO cue
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                            
	Mumbai, Sept. 18: The insurance regulator will soon come out with valuation and disclosure norms for insurers looking to float initial public offerings.        
	A handful of them will become eligible under current regulations to tap the capital market sometime next year.        
	The Insurance Regulatory Development Authority is in talks with market regulator Sebi to frame the disclosure norms that will be unveiled by the end of this month, IRDA chairman J. Hari Narayan said here today at an insurance summit organised by the Confederation of Indian Industry (CII).        
	Several insurers have expressed their desire to come out with an IPO. In July, Anil Ambani had said the group was planning a flotation of Reliance Life Insurance, an arm of Reliance Capital.        
	Subsequently, Chanda Kochhar, managing director and CEO of ICICI Bank, had also indicated that the group was keen on a public offer of ICICI Prudential Life Insurance, though she did not set a timeline for it.        
	Current regulations stipulate that only insurers that have been operating for over 10 years can list on the bourses. By this yardstick, only three will be eligible  HDFC Standard Life, Max New York Life and ICICI Prudential Life  as they were all registered in 2000.        
	Reliance Life Insurance will have to wait for a while since it was registered in 2002. The Anil Ambani group company has asked the government to relax the 10-year eligibility rule.        
	The IRDA chief said the government would have to decide whether or not to relax this rule.        
	Hari Narayan said the two regulators would be looking at key aspects relating to the red herring prospectus requirements, disclosure norms and valuation of insurance companies.        
	The two regulators will decide on the amount of information that insurers will have to divulge in the prospectus to their issues.         
	Narayan said the IRDA had already done some work on the calculation of insurance companies valuation. We have worked and standardised it (calculation of valuation). The Indian Institute of Actuaries will bring out a guidance note soon, he added.        
	Disclosures reported by insurance companies differ from those by manufacturing companies or banks in that they do not declare turnover or sales revenue. Insurance companies focus largely on their total premium income, or that earned from selling insurance policies, apart from assets under management.        
	A few insurance companies in India such as HDFC Standard Life also disclose what is called an effective premium income, an internationally followed indicator of an insurance companys performance.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Asarco bidders renew rivalry
                                                                                                               Asarco bidders renew rivalry
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Warring zone                                  
	Calcutta, Aug. 11: Sterlite Industries and Mexicos Grupo Mexico have sweetened their bids for US copper miner Asarco, as the year-long acquisition drama races towards a climax.        
	Sterlite increased the cash portion of its bid from $1.1 billion to $1.58 billion and reduced the value of the participatory note to $208 million from $770 million.        
	Hours after Sterlite presented the new offer before a bankruptcy court which would decide who would have the last laugh, Grupo came back with an improved deal.        
	It is now offering $1.72 billion in cash, higher by $260 million than its previous bid, while offering $280 million in secured notes.        
	Both the reorganisation plans are with judge Richard Schmidt of the US bankruptcy court in Corpus Christi, Texas. Hearing is expected to continue for the next two weeks.        
	The Asarco management is supporting the plan offered by Sterlite, owned by London Stock Exchange-listed Vedanta Resources Plc of Anil Agarwal.        
	Some of the creditors are also opposing Grupo Mexico, the estranged parent of Asarco.        
	In a filing with the BSE, Sterlite said the consideration was changed to reflect an increase in copper prices and to meet the expectations of the creditors.         
	Higher cash consideration also reflects our offer of cash in lieu of the reduction in the value of the Copper Price Participation Note from $770 million to $208 million, it said.        
	The company also claimed that it would be the beneficiary of 50 per cent of the proceeds from general unsecured creditors interest in a judgment against Americas Mining Corporation, a subsidiary of Grupo, awarded by US District Court of Texas, Brownsville Division.        
	Asarco, formerly American Smelting and Refining Company, is an integrated copper mining, smelting and refining company with 2,600 employees. It operates mines, mills and a smelter in Arizona and a smelter and a refinery in Texas. It had filed for bankruptcy in 2005, after it was sued for more than $1 billion in environmental clean-up and asbestos claims.

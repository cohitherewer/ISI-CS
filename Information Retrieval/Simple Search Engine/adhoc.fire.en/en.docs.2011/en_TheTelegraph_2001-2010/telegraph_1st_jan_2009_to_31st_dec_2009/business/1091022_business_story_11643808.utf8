The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Sensex takes a hit
                                                                                                               Sensex takes a hit

	Mumbai, Oct. 21: The benchmark sensex fell over 200 points on account of weak global cues that aggravated a selling spree across counters towards the end of trading today.         
	The BSE 30-share index declined sharply to trade below the 17000-level at a weeks low of 16997.86. It, however, managed to settle the day at 17009.17, down 213.84 points, or 1.24 per cent, over its previous close. In two days, the markets have lost over 300 points.        
	Brokers said investors were concerned that the sale of shares worth over Rs 32,000 crore to institutional investors by the Indian firms in the last six months could suck liquidity from the secondary market.

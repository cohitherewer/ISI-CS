                                My PPF will mature next year. I want to extend the account for another five years. Can I withdraw money every year from the account? If yes, what will be the maximum amount? Will my money continue to earn interest for the next five years?          Preetish Chatterjee, Khiddrepur
                    PPF subscribers who continue their account after 15 years with fresh subscription can make one withdrawal per year, subject to the condition that the total withdrawal during the block period should not exceed 60 per cent of the balance to their credit at the start of the extended period. Any credit balance in the account will continue to earn interest which is currently at 8 per cent.                                  Relief for seniors      You had mentioned that investment in Senior Citizen Savings Scheme is also eligible for deduction up to Rs 1 lakh under Section 80C of the Income Tax Act. When I approached a local branch of the SBI and post office, they said that there was no confirmation on this from their higher authority. I am 72-years-old. What should I do?        S.K. Nath, Behala

	Hyderabad, Aug. 4: Reliance Industries (RIL) is proceeding with its plan for a city gas distribution network in Andhra Pradesh even as it continues its legal battle with Reliance Natural Resources Limited over the rights on the gas.        
	Reliance will acquire a majority 67 per cent in Krishna-Godavari Gas Network Limited (KGNNL), set up by the Andhra Pradesh government, that has the mandate for a state-wide gas distribution network.        
	The Investment Corporation of Andhra Pradesh, Gujarat State Petroleum Corporation and IDFC Private Equity Fund will hold the balance stake with 11 per cent each.        
	Mukesh Ambani-run Reliance will sign the shareholders agreement with the state government next week, state economic adviser D.V. Somayajulu told reporters at the end of a review meeting with chief minister Y.S. Rajasekhara Reddy on gas from the KG basin.         
	Somayajulu said KGGNL would prepare a road map in the next 15 days. It would, possibly, commence supplies in four years. For Hyderabad alone, the cost of building the CGD (city gas distribution) network will be over Rs 3,500 crore, while a staggering Rs one lakh crore is required for a similar network across the state, Somayajulu said.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Mumbai, Sept. 2: German car maker BMW will set up a finance arm in India for retail customers, fleet owners and dealers.        
	With headquarters in Gurgaon, BMW Financial Services India  the proposed entity  will be fully operational by the middle of next year.         
	The subsidiary has sought a licence to operate as a non-banking finance company.         
	Besides auto loans, BMW Financial Services India will continue to offer insurance to its customers.        
	Munich-based BMW will initially invest $50 million in the finance arm and hopes to secure the necessary approvals by May next year.        
	According to reports late last year, Mercedes Benz is also planning a finance arm.        
	BMW Financial Services was established in 1993. The foundation of BMW Financial Services India was established from the achievements in the Indian market in the last three years, Peter Kronschnabl, president of BMW India, said.        
	With the economy showing signs of revival, BMW has lined up some new models for India.         
	It is planning to launch a petrol variant of the 7-Series in September followed by the two-seater convertible roadster Z4 in October.        
	The company is planning to sell 30-40 units of the Z4 per annum, which is expected to be priced between Rs 50 lakh and Rs 60 lakh.         
	Sporting a 3-litre diesel engine, the new Z4 sports car, launched last December in Europe, will come with a folding hard roof.         
	Kronschnabl had recently said that the company had sold 2,908 units last year; the target this year was over 3,000 units on the back of the launches.

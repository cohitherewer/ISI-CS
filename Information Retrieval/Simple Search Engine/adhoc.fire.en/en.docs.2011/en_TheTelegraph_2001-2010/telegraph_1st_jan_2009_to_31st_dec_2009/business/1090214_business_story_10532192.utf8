          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Hyderabad, Feb. 13: A local court today allowed the Serious Frauds Investigation Office (SFIO) to question Satyam Computers former chairman B. Ramalinga Raju and four others.        
	The two-day interrogation will start tomorrow at the Chanchalguda jail where the five are locked up in the wake of the Rs 7,100-crore Satyam scam.         
	Besides Raju, the others are his brother Rama Raju, who was Satyams managing director; Vadlamani Srinivas, who was the chief financial officer; and S. Gopalakrishnan and Talluri Srinivas, former partners of Price Waterhouse.        
	This is the SFIOs second application before the sixth additional chief metropolitan magistrate, filed on February 5. An earlier application was rejected by the same magistrate.        
	The income-tax department today wanted to question Raju. In a petition, the department sought three days time to examine and record the statement of Raju.         
	The judge posted the matter to Monday as the defence lawyer sought time to file a reply.        
	Some more decisions on Satyam were taken today.         
	A court dismissed the anticipatory bail petition of Suryanarayana Raju, a director of SRSR Advisory Services, the company through which the promoters controlled Satyam        
	The Andhra Pradesh government decided to keep on hold the Rs 120-crore road project in Kadapa district, which was allocated to Maytas Infra.

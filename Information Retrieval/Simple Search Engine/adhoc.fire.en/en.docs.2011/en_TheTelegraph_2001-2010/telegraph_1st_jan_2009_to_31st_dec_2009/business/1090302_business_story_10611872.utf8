The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | All eyes on Reliance share swap ratio
                                                                                                               All eyes on Reliance share swap ratio
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                           MERGER MATRIX                                  
	Mumbai, March 1: Market- watchers are divided over the swap ratio in the merger of Reliance Industries and Reliance Petroleum to be announced tomorrow.        
	As the boards of the two companies prepare to meet, the majority believe the ratio will benefit the shareholders of Reliance Industries Limited (RIL).         
	The ratio is likely to be between the market and book values of the two companies.         
	Based on the closing prices of both the stocks last Friday, the swap ratio could be around 17 shares of Reliance Petroleum (RPL) for every share of RIL.         
	If the book value is considered, the ratio can be around 22 shares of RPL for every share of RIL.        
	RIL has more shareholders than RPL. Moreover, it has varied interests unlike the latter, which is only into refining. Therefore, the merger ratio is likely to benefit the parent and it should be around 21 shares of RPL for one share of RIL, an analyst, who did not wish identified, said.         
	According to the analyst, the stock prices of both the companies will be impacted when trading resumes on Monday.         
	We could see RIL remaining in the green, while RPL may adjust to the possibility that the swap ratio will not be in its favour. The share could dip to Rs 71-levels, he said.         
	On Friday, the RIL share ended at Rs 1,265, while the RPL scrip closed at Rs 76.20. There are a few who feel the swap ratio can be in favour of RPL. During the merger of IPCL with RIL in 2007, the ratio benefitted the former, contrary to expectations.         
	The two companies had decided on a swap ratio of five shares of IPCL for one share of RIL.         
	The possibility of RPL shareholders getting a good ratio cannot be ruled out considering the advantages in operational synergies and tax benefits that it will bring. Moreover, the RPL stock has also underperformed vis--vis RIL in recent times. Therefore, the ratio should be in the region of 18 shares of RPL for every share of RIL, sources said.         
	Apart from the benefit of getting a refinery that is able to process heavy crude, RIL is also expected to get many tax advantages.         
	Analysts say focus will also be on the treasury stock. A treasury stock is created when a company holds its own stock because of a merger with a group firm.         
	RIL holds 70.38 per cent of RPL. Some feel RIL may give up the RPL shares, while others say it may retain the treasury stock.

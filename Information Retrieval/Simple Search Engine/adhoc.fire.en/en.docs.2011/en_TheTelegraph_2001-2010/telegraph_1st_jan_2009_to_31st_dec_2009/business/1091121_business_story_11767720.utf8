          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                           SWAP STRATEGY                                  
	Mumbai, Nov. 20: Tata Steel is rejigging its debt once again.        
	The worlds eighth largest steel maker today enticed the holders of convertible bonds worth $875 million to exchange them for new convertible foreign currency bonds (FCCBs).        
	The move will help Tata Steel to trim costs and reduce repayment obligations.        
	The new FCCBs will have a yield to maturity of 4.5 per cent and mature in November 2014.         
	Around 56 per cent of the current convertible alternative reference securities (CARS) bond holders have gone in for this conversion. These bonds are convertible at Rs 605.53 per share  15 per cent higher than Tata Steels closing share price at launch.        
	The existing CARS were due to mature in 2012 with a yield to maturity of 5.15 per cent. They were convertible into equity at Rs 733 per share and had a conversion premium of 23 per cent.        
	The aggregate principal amount of FCCBs issued stands at $54,69,35,000 in exchange for CARS of $49,30,00,000.        
	According to analysts, Tata Steels move to swap the existing bonds indicates that the company is not certain of a swift recovery in steel.         
	Besides, the company would not like to face a big redemption payout if the share price did not climb significantly to reach the conversion price.         
	It is also clear that since only 56 per cent of the CARS holders have opted for the switch, some investors do not want to lock in for a longer period, an analyst said.                          
	For Tata Steel, exchanging the existing CARS for FCCBs gives them more time to repay bond holders.        
	Tata Steel group chief financial officer Koushik Chatterjee said, While Tata Steel does not have any near term material repayment requirements over the next 12-15 months, as part of our long term financing strategy, we continue to seek market opportunities to reduce the financing costs on a pro-active basis.        
	In line with the above, the company has launched this exchange offer to exchange part or all of its existing CARS for a fresh set of convertible bonds. This not only reduces the overall finance charges for the company, but also extends the maturity of the bonds by two years, he said.        
	With this move Tata Steel is also looking at de-leveraging its balance sheet as the lower conversion premium makes the exchange bonds more equity like.         
	According to estimates, Tata Steel has debt of $7 billion to repay, a significant portion of which was taken to finance the over $12 billion buy-out of Anglo-Dutch steel maker Corus.         
	The Tata Steel scrip closed at Rs 551.60 on Friday, an increase of 2.66 per cent over the previous day.

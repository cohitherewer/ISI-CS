The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Cess on natural gas in pipeline
                                                                                                               Cess on natural gas in pipeline
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Pandey: Growth mode                                  
	New Delhi, May 13: The government plans to build a network of pipelines to transport natural gas across the country and is considering imposing a cess on the gas to fund the project.        
	Petroleum secretary R.S. Pandey said natural gas pipelines had fuelled growth the world over, but in India their impact had not been noticeable in the southern and eastern regions.        
	For equitable economic development, there is a need for a criss-cross national gas highway, he said at an industry event.        
	The oil secretary suggested a nominal cess of 20 cents per million British thermal unit on domestically produced natural gas, which might garner Rs 3,000 crore annually that could be used to build 500-600 kilometres.        
	India produces 105 million cubic meters per day (mmscmd) of gas from fields in the western and eastern offshore regions. Besides, another 25mmscmd is imported in the form of LNG.        
	According to a BP survey, India has proven gas reserves of 1.05 trillion cubic metres.         
	However, Pandey said the idea of a cess had not even been conceptualised.         
	Analysts said the government could adopt different models for building the pipeline such as inviting private parties to build different sections or giving it to a single party under the build-operate- transfer model.        
	Sources said if the cess was imposed, the pipeline would be in areas which might not attract private investment at the initial stage.        
	Officials said the government was considering building a network as private investment till now had not been at the desired level.        
	Gas through government pipelines would be cheaper as unlike private operators it would not follow the cost-plus approach in calculating transportation charges.        
	Costs on transportation make up 40 per cent of the final price in some cases.        
	Pandey said Indias first cross-country pipeline  Hazira-Vijaipur-Jagdishpur pipeline  had transformed the regions through which it had traversed.        
	But there is no infrastructure to transport gas to the southern and eastern regions. Even the northern region is not completely covered. There is an urgent need for a national gas highway on the lines of national highways, he said.        
	Fuel sale loss        
	Indian Oil, Bharat Petroleum and Hindustan Petroleum may suffer over Rs 15,000 crore revenue loss on fuel sales this fiscal, Pandey said.

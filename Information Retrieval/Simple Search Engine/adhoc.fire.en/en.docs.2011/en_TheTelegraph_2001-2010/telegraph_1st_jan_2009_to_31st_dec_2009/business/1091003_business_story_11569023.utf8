	New Delhi, Oct. 2: Taiwan-based HTC Corporation is gearing up to bring more 3G-enabled handsets to India. The high-speed third generation services will be introduced in the country next year.         
	The smartphone maker expects the new range of handsets to push up its market share to above 25 per cent by the end of March 2010.         
	With the country opening up to 3G, we can bring more devices from our international portfolio which have 3G-enabled features. Globally 3G has been our forte, Ajay Sharma, country head of HTC India, told The Telegraph.        
	The auction of 3G spectrum will be held in December this year; telecom operators will launch the services by October 2010.         
	HTC  which had introduced touchscreen phones in India  has 12 smartphones in its Indian portfolio, of which five are 3G-enabled. The five handsets are HTC Hero, Magic, Touch Diamond2, Touch HD and Touch 3G.         
	We are planning to launch two-three devices per quarter in the Rs 10,000-plus category. These will be 3G-enabled with HTC sense-user interface, said Sharma. HTC sold around 300,000 smartphones in India in 2008.         
	The HTC user interface will be available on all new devices launched in India.         
	The growth driver in the smartphone category will be the user interface  devices which enable access to online content, entertainment data and other sources of information through simple and customised interface, said Sharma.        
	It has three major features  gesture control, widget support and integration of different applications in a single view.

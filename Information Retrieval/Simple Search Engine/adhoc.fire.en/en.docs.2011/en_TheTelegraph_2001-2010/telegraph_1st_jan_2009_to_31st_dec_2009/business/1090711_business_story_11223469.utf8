The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | GM makes a fresh start
                                                                                                               GM makes a fresh start
          MICHAEL J. DE LA MERCED NICK BUNKLEY                           GM chief executive officer Fritz Henderson in Detroit on Friday. (Reuters)                                  
	New York, July 10: The chief executive of General Motors began a new era for the car maker on Friday with a promise and a thanks and said business was usual at the firm.        
	We deeply appreciate the support weve received during this historic transformation and will work hard to repay the trust and the money that so many have invested in GM, CEO Fritz Henderson said just a couple of hours after the company closed the sale of its good assets to a new, government-backed car maker.         
	The last 100 days has shown everyone, including ourselves, that a company not known for quick action can indeed move very fast, Henderson said. Starting today, we want to take that intensity, the decisiveness and the speed of these last several weeks, and transfer it from the battlefield triage of the bankruptcy process to the day-to-day operations of the new company.        
	GMs goal, Henderson said, was to design, build and sell the best vehicles in the world, something that the company had forgotten. Our goal is to make each and every General Motors car, truck and crossover the best-in-class, he said promising that the car maker would focus on customers.        
	Earlier, GM and the government completed the legal paperwork needed to put the companys most desirable assets, including brands such as Chevrolet, Cadillac and GMC, into the new company  now named Vehicle Acquisition Company but soon to be renamed the General Motors Company. The federal government will hold nearly 61 percent of the new company, with the Canadian government, a health care trust for the United Auto Workers union and bondholders owning the balance.        
	The new company will be much smaller, with brands such as Saturn, Hummer, Opel and Pontiac in the process of being sold or closed. It will also have a smaller sales network, with thousands of dealers having been cut during the reorganisation.                                                                                            
	Its just beginning. Its nowhere near over, said Keith Crain, the publisher and editorial director of Automotive News, an industry trade publication. Theyre going to need hard work, a lot of smarts, and theyre going to need good luck, he said.                                                        
	The new company will be much smaller, with brands such as Saturn, Hummer, Opel and Pontiac in the process of being sold or closed. It will also have a smaller sales network, with thousands of dealers having been cut during the reorganization.        
	When G.M. filed for Chapter 11 on June 1, a humbling moment for the once-dominant carmaker, President Obama promised that the reorganization would be quick and controlled. Indeed, throughout its court proceedings in Lower Manhattan, lawyers, G.M. executives and the administration argued that speed was vital. (The administration initially cautioned that the reorganization might take as long as 90 days.)        
	The only alternative to the sale plan, they said, was liquidation, a prospect that they argued would send shock waves throughout the economy and leave G.M.s creditors with nothing.        
	Unlike Chrysler, whose reorganization included a challenge by three Indiana state funds that rose to the Supreme Court, G.M. has not faced an opponent with enough clout to derail its sale. It faced objections from dissident retail bondholders, who held a fraction of G.M.s $27 billion in bonds, as well as from accident victim litigants, asbestos claimholders and some retirees whose claims would be largely wiped out.         
	But none of the protests rose higher than Federal District Court, where bankruptcy court rulings are initially appealed. And in the decision approving G.M.s sale, Judge Robert E. Gerber of Federal Bankruptcy Court said that his ruling relied in part on the precedents set by Chryslers bankruptcy case a month earlier.        
	With the closing of the sale, the hard part for G.M. is only beginning.        
	Senior administration officials have promised that they will not micromanage the company, despite being the majority owner and having already picked new directors, including Mr. Whitacre, the former chairman and chief executive of AT amp;T. By the end of the year, the government will have poured $50 billion of taxpayer money into the automaker.        
	The administration hopes to take the new G.M. public again next year.        
	We are here to get the government out of the auto business, Steven Rattner, the head of the governments auto task force, told reporters this week.        
	But until that point  and beyond  the new G.M. must grapple with swooning car sales. New auto purchases are down 37 percent this year, with the seasonally adjusted annual rate now standing at 9.91 million vehicles, still below what the American carmakers need to break even. Mr. Henderson, G.M.s chief executive, testified in court that he does not expect his company to turn a profit this year.        
	G.M. must also learn to exist as a much less dominant player. For the first six months, it held less than 20 percent of the market, far from the 50 percent it commanded decades ago. Rivals from Toyota to Hyundai to even Ford, which has sought to restructure its finances outside of bankruptcy, have all gained market share.

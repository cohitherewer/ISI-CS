                                                                                                               Marginal rise in L amp;T quarterly profit
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Mumbai, May 28: Larsen amp; Toubro (L amp;T)  the engineering and construction company  today posted a 3.3 per cent rise in net profit during the fourth quarter ended March 31, despite a Rs 186-crore provision for the diminution in value of its investment in Satyam Computer Services.        
	L amp;T reported a net profit of Rs 998.52 crore for the quarter against Rs 966.76 crore in the corresponding period of the previous year.         
	Analysts were expecting L amp;T to post a net profit in the region of Rs 900 crore.        
	The company said it had provided Rs 186.28 crore in respect of investment in Satyam held by itself as well as by its wholly owned subsidiary, L amp;T Capital Company Ltd (LTCCL).        
	L amp;T added that the provision had been made as a measure of abundant caution and in consonance with its commitment to acquire the investment from LTCCL at book value when such a transfer takes place.        
	Considering the extraordinary circumstances under which the price of Satyam shares fell in the market, the provision has been created based on the principle of prudence, it said.         
	L amp;T now holds 12 per cent in Satyam. The shares are subject to a lock-in period of six months. The average price of its stake is around Rs 82 per share.

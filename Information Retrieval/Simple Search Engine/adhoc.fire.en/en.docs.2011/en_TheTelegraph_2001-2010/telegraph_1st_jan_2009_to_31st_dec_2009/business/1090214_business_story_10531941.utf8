	Calcutta, Feb. 13: Tata Steel expects demand to pick up in the current quarter.        
	B. Muthuraman, managing director of Tata Steel, said sales during the January-March period would be higher over the previous quarter (October-December) as well as the same period last fiscal.        
	Our sales (in February) will be higher by 10-15 per cent over January, which were again better than December, Muthuraman said here today.         
	Tata Steel sold 26 per cent more in January this year over the same period last fiscal. According to Muthuraman, demand from the automobile and consumer durables segments has fallen, while construction continues to buy.        
	The company has not announced any production cuts in India. Its European arm Corus has reduced output by 35 per cent.         
	Acquired by the Tatas in early 2007, Corus is Europes second largest steel producer with 20mt capacity.        
	Steel prices are still low though demand seems to be picking up. They are now at $450-500 a tonne compared with $1,000 a tonne in early 2008, denting margins globally.         
	ArcelorMittal reported a loss of $2.6 billion during October-December, while Tata Steel recorded a 56 per cent drop in profit. It is due to come out with its consolidated result, incorporating Corus, at the end of this month.        
	Muthuraman said the company would go ahead with its expansion projects in Jamshedpur and at Kalinganagar in Orissa despite the meltdown.         
	Tata Steel plans to expand the Jamshedpur facility to 10mt and build a 3mt plant in Orissa.        
	Muthuraman was in Calcutta today to inaugurate IFEX09, a trade fair organised by the Indian Institute of Foundrymen (IIF).         
	The company, however, has put the brakes on its plans for plants Chattisgarh and Jharkhand. It has also decided to put all new acquisitions on hold because of the global economic slump.

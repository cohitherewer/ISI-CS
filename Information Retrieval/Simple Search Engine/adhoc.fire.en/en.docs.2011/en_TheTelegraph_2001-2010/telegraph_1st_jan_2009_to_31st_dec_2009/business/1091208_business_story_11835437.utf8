	Mumbai. Dec. 7: Infrastructure companies are hitting the road once again for a fresh bout of fund raising.         
	These firms are expected to raise over a billion dollars  excluding big ticket transactions by power companies  by the close of this financial year, said two bankers.         
	We are seeing a hectic fund-raising activity for infrastructure projects such as airports, ports and roads. Several large transactions are being processed at present, said Ernst amp; Young national director Jayesh Desai.         
	The GMR group, which has been in talks with private equity firms to raise $400-500 million for its airport business, may be close to finalising a deal with Macquaire, said sources.         
	GMR Airport Holdings is a partner in consortiums that run the Delhi and Hyderabad airports and contributes a large chunk to the companys revenues.        
	The minority stake sale will add to the companys kitty and the money will be invested in other infrastructure-related ventures of the group.         
	An investment banker said the GVK group, which holds around 40 per cent in Mumbai International Airport, is also expected to announce a fund- raising programme shortly. The group, which is making some large investments, is likely to need a fresh infusion soon.         
	For instance, GVK Power amp; Infrastructure has bought an additional 17 per cent stake in Bengaluru International Airport Ltd (Bial), through a subsidiary, from L amp;T Infrastructure Development Projects for Rs 686 crore. The company had earlier acquired Zurich Airports stake in Bial of around 12 per cent.         
	The Gautam Adani-controlled Adani Enterprises will soon join a long list of companies that have recently raised funds through qualified institutional placements (QIPs).         
	In an extraordinary general meeting held in end-November, the company had sought shareholders approval to enhance the present limit of issue of shares to QIBs from Rs 1,500 crore to Rs 4,000 crore.         
	Adani Enterprises has restructured its businesses into three thrust areas  energy, infrastructure and agri-related business.         
	Several road projects are also seeking a significant amount of funds, said bankers.         
	These are largely new players in this space, said a banker who did not specify which players were talking to bankers and private equity firms.         
	Infrastructure firms have been raising capital over the last few years and have also been a favourite with some large private equity players. Recently, there were reports that the World Bank is expected to up its lending to India by more than three times to $7 billion in 2009-10 as compared to an average of around $2.3 billion annually over the past four years.        
	The companys infrastructure business comprises the Mundra Port and special economic zone as well as real estate projects.

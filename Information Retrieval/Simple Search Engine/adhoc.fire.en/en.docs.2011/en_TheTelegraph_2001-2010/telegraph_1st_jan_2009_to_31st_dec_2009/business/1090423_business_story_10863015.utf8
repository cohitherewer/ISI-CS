	Mumbai, April 22: Wipro Ltd  Indias third largest software firm  beat Street expectations by posting a 15 per cent increase in its consolidated profit after tax at Rs 1,010 crore for the fourth quarter ended March 31, 2009, compared with Rs 880 crore in the corresponding period a year ago.        
	Total revenue for the fourth quarter of 2008-09 rose 13 per cent to Rs 6,452 crore from Rs 5,700 crore in the same period last year.         
	According to a release issued by the company, IT services revenue in constant currency was $1.058 billion, beating the guidance of $1.045 billion.        
	Overall, we see Wipros results are better than the disappointments at TCS and Infosys, said an analysis by global brokerage firm CLSA.         
	Another analyst said the companys fourth quarter results in IT services were boosted by a weakening rupee.         
	However, the company that has interests in outsourcing, technology products and lighting offered a muted guidance for the first quarter of 2009-10.         
	The company expects revenues from IT services to be in the range of $1.009 billion and $1.025 billion in the quarter ending June 30, lower than $1.058 billion in the fourth quarter of 2008-09.        
	On the companys performance, Wipro chairman Azim Premji said, Its been a landmark year for us. We did a major reorganisation of our IT business at the beginning of the financial year. It has been a year of solid execution in a subdued environment resulting in industry leading growth.

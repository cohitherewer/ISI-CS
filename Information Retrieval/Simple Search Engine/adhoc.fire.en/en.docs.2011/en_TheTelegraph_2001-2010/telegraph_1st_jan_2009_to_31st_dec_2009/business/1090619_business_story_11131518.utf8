                                                                                                               Infy hints at foreign issue 
                            
	New York, June 18 (PTI): Software services major Infosys Technologies has filed a prospectus with the US securities and exchange commission to enable the registration of new securities in advance.        
	The company yesterday filed form F-3 with the US market regulator wherein it said from time to time, selling shareholders of Infosys Technologies Ltd may sell American depository shares, or ADSs, representing our equity shares in amounts, at prices and on terms described in one or more supplements to this prospectus.        
	Form F-3 is a kind of shelf-registration of a new issue, which can be prepared up to two years in advance. This registration facilitates the process wherein a new issue can be offered as soon as funds are needed or market conditions are favourable.        
	Each ADS that would be offered would represent one equity share.        
	The filing further said all ADSs sold pursuant to this prospectus will be sold on behalf of the selling shareholders. We will not receive any of the proceeds from the sale of the ADSs.        
	Infosys ADSs are listed on the Nasdaq Global Select Market and quoted at $34.84 apiece on June 16.        
	The companys net profit after tax for the quarter ended March 31, 2009 stood at Rs 1,613 crore, a 29 per cent increase over the corresponding period a year ago. Revenue rose 24.1 per cent to Rs 5,635 crore on a year-on-year basis.

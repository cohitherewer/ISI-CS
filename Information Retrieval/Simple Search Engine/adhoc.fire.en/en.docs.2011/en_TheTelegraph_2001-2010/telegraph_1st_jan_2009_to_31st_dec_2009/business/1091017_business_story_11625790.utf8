          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Oct.16: The government today launched a scheme to increase the distribution of LPG in rural areas.        
	The scheme aims at setting up small-sized LPG distribution agencies to increase rural penetration in all locations having potential of 600 refill sales per month, Union petroleum minister Murli Deora today said at the launch of the Rajiv Gandhi Gramin LPG Vitrak plan.         
	The government plans to increase connections to 16.5 crore households from 11 crore, with a focus on rural areas.        
	More than 83 per cent of the current LPG network is in the urban areas, while only 17 per cent is in the villages.        
	Deora said, The scheme is initially being launched in eight states covering over 1,200 locations where the reach of LPG is very low.         
	The states include Bengal, Jharkhand, Orissa and Bihar.        
	According to Vision-2015, 75 per cent of the population should have access to LPG.         
	To ensure that the use of the fuel is evenly spread, oil marketing companies will be identifying locations in rural areas so that 50 per cent of the population in each district and at least 60 per cent of the population in each state have LPG over the next five years.         
	Deora said the scheme would eliminate ailments caused by chulhas and provide employment opportunities in rural areas.

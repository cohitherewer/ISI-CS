The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Corporate India prefers QIP route for cash chase
                                                                                                               Corporate India prefers QIP route for cash chase
          PIYA SINGH                                            
	Mumbai, June 25: The QIP bandwagon is getting ready to roll.        
	Several large Indian companies will shortly embark on a spate of roadshows to raise over $10 billion through stock offerings pitched at institutional investors. But the pundits feel the cash-raising drive isnt going to be easy and will call for a lot of hardsell.        
	The big fear is that the sensex  which has run by over 65 per cent since March 1  has led to the overvaluation of stocks. Investment bankers say the potential investors will be spooked by the size of the pipeline for qualified institutional placements (QIPs).        
	The $10-billion corpus could swell. Global brokerage CLSA says that it expects issuances worth another $9 billion  which could then make QIPs one of the biggest cash-raising devices that companies intend to use this year.        
	The QIP is a capital raising device that market regulator Sebi introduced in 2006. It allows a listed company to issue shares, convertible debentures and other instruments but not warrants to raise money.         
	These securities are offered to institutional investors and must be converted into equity after a reasonable period of time. It is one of the quickest ways to raise money and cuts through a lot of procedural hassles. For instance, companies do not need to make a pre-issue filing with the regulator.        
	Over the past two weeks, large companies like Essar Oil (which expects to raise Rs 100 billion) and HCC have already kicked off their road shows. Several others are preparing to market their proposed QIPs and investment banks who work in the public markets have their hands full, said a Mumbai-based investment banker.        
	There is a long queue to raise funds while the sensex is still above the 14000-mark. Amid all the excitement, market sources said two real estate and infrastructure companies  HDIL and GMR  might be reconsidering their plans to go ahead with the proposed issues.        
	A recent report by Kotak Institutional Equities Research has expressed a lot of scepticism about how the market will react to the flurry of qualified institutional placements.        
	We expect large equity issuance by Indian companies and potential divestment by the government to act as an overhang on the market. The market has readily absorbed $2.6 billion of fresh issuance and divestment by major shareholders given the large flows from FIIs and a buoyant investment mood. However, it remains to be seen whether the market would be receptive to these likely QIPs, said the report.        
	The promoters of several companies are keen to take advantage of the latest bull run before the market makes an anticipated correction. For instance, realty company DLFs promoters sold a 10 per cent stake at Rs 230 per share in mid-May. The DLF scrip closed at Rs 317.80 on the Bombay Stock Exchange today.        
	Another banker said the promoters were aware of the inflated stock valuations but were looking to take a chance before the funding window closed again.        
	Some private equity players have been waiting to invest in good companies after a long hiatus but have been deterred by the valuations.         
	Last year, no one was willing to issue equity. The mood has changed but valuations still need to be more realistic, said the head of a US-based private equity fund which has an office in Mumbai.

          GARIMA SINGH NEOGY                          Gearing up                                  
	New Delhi, Aug. 14: German premium car manufacturer Porsche will introduce hybrid versions of the SUV Cayenne and the sedan Panamera in India soon.        
	The hybrid version of the Cayenne will go on sale in late 2010. We do not have the exact dates for an India launch yet, Ashish Chordia, CEO of Precision Cars India, the official importer of Porsche in India, told The Telegraph.        
	He said a hybrid Panamera was being planned, which might be soon launched in India.        
	Sources say while the Cayenne hybrid will be rolled out as part of a global launch, the Panamera hybrid will drive in by the second half of 2011.        
	The Cayenne hybrid is expected to have a 4-cylinder engine efficiency with V8 performance along with 20 per cent lower carbon dioxide emission. It is expected to sport a price tag of Rs 70 lakh or more.        
	The company sells 10 to 13 Cayennes a month in India. It is available in five variants, including the sporty GTS and the Turbo. The base model costs Rs 63 lakh (ex-showroom, Delhi).        
	The US, Europe and Japan are big markets for hybrids, while India is a relatively new market for this green technology.        
	Porsche is planning to develop an engine that will deliver a fuel economy of 11km per litre on the Cayenne hybrid. This is 25 per cent more than the current efficiency of 6km per litre in cities and 8.9 km per litre on highways.        
	The company will launch the Panamera in India in October this year and hopes to sell about 50 units.        
	Also known as the Gran Turismo, the Panamera is the first sports sedan from Porsche with four doors. It was unveiled at the Shanghai Motor Show 2009. The cars top versions with a V8 power unit will carry a price tag in the range of Rs 1.4 crore to Rs 2 crore.        
	Rod Wallace, managing director of Precision Cars India, said bookings for 13 cars had been completed.        
	Porsche has set up a plant in Germany exclusively to manufacture about 20,000 Panameras.         
	Total production at its German plant declined from 98,000 units in 2008 to 80,000 this year because of recession, Wallace said.         
	However, sales of Porsche cars have been tardy in India. The company has sold only around 650 cars since its entry three years ago.         
	With dealers only in Mumbai and Delhi, Porsche has a limited presence.        
	In another three years, there are plans to have 11 dealers. In the near future there will be dealers in Chennai, Hyderabad and Cochin.        
	Mumbai is the biggest market for Porsche.

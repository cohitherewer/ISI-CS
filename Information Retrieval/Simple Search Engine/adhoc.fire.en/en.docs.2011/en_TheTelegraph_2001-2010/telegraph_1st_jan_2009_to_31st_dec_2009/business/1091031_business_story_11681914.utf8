The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Essar targets Shell refineries
                                                                                                               Essar targets Shell refineries
                            
	New Delhi, Oct. 30 (PTI): British energy giant Royal Dutch Shell is in exclusive talks to sell three of its refineries in Europe to the Ruias-owned Essar Oil.        
	Talks are on to sell Shells Stanlow refinery in northwest England and the Heide and Hamburg units in Germany, a company spokesperson said.        
	We are only talking to Essar, the spokesperson said. The spokesperson said talks with other interested parties had ended but did not identify them.        
	The three refineries have a combined capacity of around 23 million tonnes and the acquisition, if successful, will be done through Essar Energy Holdings Ltd, a unit of Essar Oil.        
	Yes. Essar has entered into an exclusive negotiation with Shell for buying Shells refinery at Stanlow in the UK and Heide and Harburg in Germany, an Essar spokesperson said. However, it is too premature to comment on the matter.        
	The Hamburg unit has capacity to process 110,000 barrels per day of crude (5.5 million tonnes a year), while Heide has a capacity of 91,000 barrels a day (4.55 million tonnes). Stanlow, Britains second-largest refinery, can process 233,000 barrels a day (11.65 million tonnes).        
	Media reports have valued the three refineries at 1-1.5 billion ($2.48 billion).        
	Shell, based in The Hague, is looking to save cash and slash costs as it fights back against a global economic downturn that has reduced energy demand and oil prices.

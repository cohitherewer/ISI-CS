                                                                                                               Sebi poser irks Raju
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Raju: Ill at ease                                  
	Hyderabad, Feb. 5: B. Ramalinga Raju was distinctly uncomfortable today as Sebi officials subjected him to a barrage of questions on the share movements of Satyam and Maytas Infra and benami deals.        
	He was not happy at our probing questions and was keen that the exercise ended soonest, said a member of the Sebi team.        
	In their second day of grilling, Sebi officials asked Raju whether he had given Maytas and Satyam shares to politicians. A rattled Raju replied: Show me if you have any proof otherwise please do not mob me with such questions.         
	Sources said the officials of the Chanchalguda jail, where Raju, his brother Rama Raju and ex-Satyam CFO Srinivas Vadlamani are inmates, had rejected the market watchdogs request for privacy. Sebi officials wanted jail guards to maintain a distance during the questioning.         
	We have no directions from the court that we should leave the Sebi officials alone, the prison authorities said.        
	Rama Raju, the former Satyam MD, today reportedly told the Sebi officials that he had very little knowledge of his brothers activities. My brother dealt with everything and I came to know most of it only in the last few months.

	Officials of the US stock market regulator  Securities Exchange Commission  today met the Satyam board members. A dozen class action lawsuits have been filed in the US against Satyam, whose shares are traded on the New York Stock Exchange.

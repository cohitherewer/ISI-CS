                                Is the money received as commutation of pension taxable?          P. Haldar, Durgapur
                      Under Section 10(10A), the commuted value of pension is tax-exempt. The section allows for full exemption of the commuted value of pension received under Civil Pension (Commutation) Rules or a similar rule. This is generally applicable in the case of employees of central or state governments and local authorities. For pension received from any other employer under any other scheme and the employee also getting gratuity, the maximum exemption allowed is 33 per cent. If the employee is not getting gratuity, 50 per cent of the commuted value of pension will be tax-exempt. Full amount of the commuted value of pension is tax-exempt if it is given by a fund set up by LIC under a pension scheme.                                       Gift for son      I am a senior citizen and my son is an NRI. I want to gift him some money. Do I have to pay any tax for this gift?         Manish Mitra, Midnapore
                    Gifting money to your son wont attract any tax. But since your son is an NRI, gifting money to an NRI by a resident Indian may attract the provisions under the FEMA. However, the RBI introduced a Liberalised Remittance Scheme under which an Indian resident can now gift or donate up to $2,00,000 in one financial year without the prior approval of the RBI and without attracting the FEMA provisions.                                  Tuition time      I give private tuitions. I have PAN also. Which IT Form should I use to file the return for the financial year 2008-09?         Rupa Roy, Calcutta
                    Private tuition comes under profession assessable for income tax purposes. If you want to file the return for income related to business or profession, you should use Form ITR-4. However, Form ITR-4 is quite lengthy and complex. That makes the work of filling the form quite cumbersome for ordinary taxpayers.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                           Welcome move                                  
	Mumbai, Dec. 31: In a New Year bonanza to home and car loan borrowers, ICICI Bank today reduced its benchmark lending rate by 50 basis points, passing on the benefits to both existing and new borrowers.        
	The benchmark advance rate for companies has been reduced 50 basis points to 16.25 per cent from today.         
	Alongside, interest rates on fixed deposits have been reduced 75 basis points.         
	The floating rate for home and auto loans (floating reference rate) has been slashed to 13.5 per cent from 14.25 per cent.         
	All existing home and auto loan customers on floating interest rates will benefit from this reduction, the bank said.         
	Earlier this month, the bank had cut the lending rate for new home loans of up to Rs 20 lakh by 150 basis points.        
	Sources close to ICICI Bank say the impact will be immediate as it resets interest rates for most of its customers on the first of every quarter.         
	As of September 30, 2008, retail lendings constituted 55 per cent of ICICI Banks exposures. Within the total retail book of Rs 1,22,500 crore, the share of home loans was 51 per cent.         
	ICICI Bank is No. 2 in home loans after HDFC.         
	Its decision comes after aggressive cuts by public sector rivals such as the State Bank of India, Punjab National Bank and the Bank of Baroda. They have cut interest rates by at least 75 basis points.         
	The Reserve Bank of India began aggressively cutting key rates in October to help the economy.         
	Hudco loans        
	Public sector housing finance firm Housing and Urban Development Corporation has reduced interest rates on home and project loans by 50 to 125 basis points.        
	Hudco has reduced its rate of interest on project loans by 50 basis points and individual home loans (Hudco Niwas) between 100 and 125 basis points for loans up to Rs 20 lakh for floating rate of interest, a statement said.        
	Hudco chairman and managing director K.L. Dhingra said the rates would be effective from tomorrow.        
	For loans up to five years, the interest rate is down to 10.25 per cent from 11.50 per cent.        
	LIC Housing Finance today announced a reduction of 75 basis points in interest rates for existing home loans with effect from tomorrow. The reduction is on EMIs falling due on January 1, 2009 and payable on February 1, 2009, the company said in a statement

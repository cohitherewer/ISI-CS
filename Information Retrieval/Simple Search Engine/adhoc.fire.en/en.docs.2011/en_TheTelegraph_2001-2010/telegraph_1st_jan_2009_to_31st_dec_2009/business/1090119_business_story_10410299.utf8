The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | A tough choice
                                                                                                               A tough choice
        Consider the hidden costs before you opt for Ulips to increase your exposure to equities, says Srikumar Bondyopadhyay                                            
	The Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority recently reduced the capital requirement for life insurance companies to underwrite both unit-linked and non-unit linked policies. Following this, life insurers were expected to lower their premium rates across products. But, instead of slashing the premium rates, life insurers are scaling down their capital infusion plans as they now require to set aside less capital to underwrite the same number of policies.         
	New entrants, however, are trying to lure policy buyers by significantly cutting their premium allocation charges for unit-linked insurance policies (Ulips). Premium allocation charge is deducted from the premium paid and the rest is used to buy units in investment funds.         
	New avenues        
	This may be seen as a good trend. The higher the premium allocation charge, the lower will be the amount allocated for investments. Thus, a lower premium allocation charge will mean a higher fund corpus for a Ulip policyholder.        
	For example, Future Generali Life Insurance Company, which started its business in August last year, launched a pension plan called Future Freedom. This plan has a limited term of three years for premium payment. The premium allocation charges are 5 per cent in the first year and 2 per cent each in the second and third year. Thus, a policyholder of Future Freedom pays only 9 per cent towards premium allocation charge and the remaining 91 per cent is invested in fund units.         
	At the same time, for the Future Pension Advantage Plan, Future Generali charges 14-15 per cent in the first year and 5 per cent in the second year. However, there is no premium allocation charge from the third year. Thus, the total premium allocation charge is 19-20 per cent.         
	Now, consider the Horizon II Pension Plan by SBI Life Insurance Company. The premium allocation charges are at the rate of 15 per cent in the first year, 7.5 per cent in the second and third year and 1.5 per cent from the fourth to tenth year. From the eleventh year, there is no premium allocation charge. So, the total premium allocation charge under the plan is 40.5 per cent!         
	Similarly, for its Unit Linked Pension Plan II, HDFC Standard Life charges 40 per cent in the first year, 15 per cent in the second year and 2 per cent thereafter. Hence, for a plan of 10 years, the total premium allocation charge will be 71 per cent!         
	Life insurers are slashing their premium allocation charges to attract prospective policy buyers amidst fierce competition from within the industry and outside, said Rajiv Jamkhedker, chief executive officer of Aegon Religare Life Insurance Company, which launched its pension plan earlier this month. Aegon Religares plan comes with a premium allocation charge of 25 per cent in the first year (for a policy of 15 years and above) and no charges thereafter.         
	In the past 12 months, four new private sector life insurance companies started their businesses and another got the final approval from the insurance regulator. There are now 22 companies registered with the insurance regulator.        
	Tax push        
	There is another reason for life insurers to reduce their premium allocation charges. The Finance Bill of 2008-09 has brought the fund management services of Ulips under the purview of service tax that will be levied at the rate of 12.36 per cent.         
	The government had earlier brought the mortality charges (the charges that insurers deduct towards pure life risk cover) under the service tax net.         
	Life insurers, therefore, will have to levy service tax not only on mortality charges that they appropriate by cancelling units accumulated in a policyholders investment fund, but also on the premium allocation charge, policy maintenance charge and fund management charge.         
	If the premium allocation charge is high, then policyholders will have to pay a higher service tax.         
	So, life insurers felt the need to lower the premium allocation charges to reduce the service tax burden on policyholders.        
	Measure for measure        
	With lower premium allocation charges, the cost of Ulips is now comparable with mutual funds. Premium allocation charges of Ulips can be compared with entry loads charged by mutual funds.         
	However, mutual fund investors dont have to pay any entry load if they purchase the units directly from the fund house. The entry load in a mutual fund is payable only when it is bought from a distributor or a sales agent.         
	Mutual funds generally charge an entry load of 2.25 per cent to 2.5 per cent for their equity schemes. If you invest every year (compare it with the annual premium payment in a Ulip) in an equity mutual fund for 10 years, your total cost will vary between 22.50 per cent to 25 per cent.         
	In comparison, your total outgo towards premium allocation charge (for 10 years) in the Future Freedom plan will be 9 per cent, 25 per cent in the Aegon Religare Pension Plan, 20 per cent in the Future Pension Advantage Plan and 36 per cent in Bharti Axa Dreamlife Pension Plan.         
	However, Ulips also come with a policy administration fee, unlike mutual funds. Life insurers charge between Rs 35 and Rs 70 per month as administration fee by knocking off units from the policy fund.         
	But Ulips score over mutuals when it comes to fund management charges. While mutual funds generally charge between 1.8 per cent and 2.5 per cent for fund management under their equity schemes, it varies between 1.5 and 1.75 per cent for growth fund options in Ulips .        
	Hence, a prospective buyer should take into account the total cost, involving premium allocation, policy administration and fund management charges, before opting for Ulips over mutual funds, provided the purchase is made for investment purposes.

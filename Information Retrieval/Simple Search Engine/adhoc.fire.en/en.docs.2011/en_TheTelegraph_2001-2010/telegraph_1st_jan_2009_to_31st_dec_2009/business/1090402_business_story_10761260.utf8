The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Exports shrink 22% in February
                                                                                                               Exports shrink 22% in February
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                            
	New Delhi, April 1: Exports dipped nearly 22 per cent in February, the lowest in 13 years, because of the global recession.        
	Exporters expect the situation to improve from this month.        
	According to A. Sakthivel, president of the Federation of Indian Export Organisations, The coming financial year should be good with the improvement in overseas markets.         
	Exporters should remain in the markets so that they can reap the dividends once the recovery process starts, which seems to be just round the corner, he said.        
	Exports dipped to $11.91 billion in February from $15.22 billion in the corresponding period last year.         
	Imports declined to $16.82 billion from $21.93 billion, which narrowed the merchandise trade deficit to $4.91 billion from $6.1 billion in January.        
	The government is not as optimistic as the exporters.        
	We will be lucky if we touch the $170-billion target for the 2008-09 fiscal. This means a growth of around 3-4 per cent, according to commerce secretary G.K. Pillai.        
	He said his estimate was in the context of the World Trade Organisation projecting a drop of 9 per cent in global trade in 2009.         
	Rajiv Kumar, director of the Indian Council for Research on International Economic Relations, said, Exports will remain flat in 2009-10 as the global economy will take time to bounce back. So the $200-billion target is not achievable.         
	In services, analysts expect the situation to improve in IT, which is expected to grow 16-17 per cent in 2008-09 to $47 billion.        
	 Nasscom, the apex body of IT software and services, has projected the industry to clock revenues of $60-62 billion by 2010-11.

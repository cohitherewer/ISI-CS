	Mumbai, March 26: Tata Tea and the European Bank of Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) have joined hands to pick up a 51 per cent stake in Russian branding, packing and distribution firm  Grand  for an undisclosed sum.        
	In a statement, Tata Tea said the remaining 49 per cent stake would be retained by Grands founder Alexander Borisov, a long-term associate of the Tatas.         
	After the acquisition, Tata Tea will hold 33.2 per cent and the EBRD will own 17.8 per cent of Grand. The acquisition is likely to be wrapped up in the first half of this year.        
	Tata Tea, which is trying to position itself as a global beverages company, said the deal marked its entry into Russia, a major market.        
	Tata Teas investment in Grand will finance the modernisation of the latters facilities.        
	Grand was set up in 1994. It is a major player in the economy segment, both in tea and coffee, and is focused on regions outside big cities and areas such as the Urals, Siberia and southern Russia.        
	Tata Tea expects to work with the EBRD to make Grand a multi-million dollar business in the next three years by pursuing acquisitions and introducing new brands in Russia, the statement said.         
	Tata Tea today rose Rs 15, or 2.76 per cent, to Rs 559 on the Bombay Stock Exchange.

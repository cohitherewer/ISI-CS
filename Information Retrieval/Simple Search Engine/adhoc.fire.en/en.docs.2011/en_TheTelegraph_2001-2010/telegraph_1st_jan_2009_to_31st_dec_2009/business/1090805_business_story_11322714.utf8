  RNRL rejects claims          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                                  
	New Delhi, Aug. 4: The war of words between the Congress-led government and Anil Ambani escalated today with V.K. Sibal, the director-general of hydrocarbons, claiming that several independent experts had certified that Reliance Industries had not padded the costs of gas exploration in the Krishna-Godavari basin  a contention that was immediately challenged by Reliance Natural Resources, which wanted those reports to be placed in public domain.        
	Sibal said the Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) had audited the capital expenditure plan of Reliance Industries and found it did cost Rs 45,000 crore ($ 8.83 billion).         
	On Monday, Ambani had demanded that the CAG and the Central Vigilance Commissioner pore over the capital expenditure in the KG basin because RIL had been gold-plating costs as a way to deny the government its proper share of revenues.        
	Rejecting Ambanis charge that it had approved RILs exorbitant capital expenditure plan for gasfields without a proper audit, Sibal said the actual expenditure had been subject to three audits, including one by the CAG.        
	In the opinion of the experts, the development plan is highly cost-effective and fast track. A CAG audit has recently been completed, he said.        
	The idea of gold-plating betrays a lack of knowledge of business economics. Inflating the expenditure does not benefit any stakeholder  neither the contractor nor the government, Sibal said.        
	We are surprised by the DGHs comments that inflating the capital expenditure on KG-D6 does not benefit RIL, said RNRL in a statement issued in the evening.        
	It said that under the terms of the production sharing contract with the government signed in April 2000, RIL was entitled to first recover its entire capital expenditure, before the government gets any meaningful share, and hence, RIL has substantial motivation to claim higher capital expenditure.        
	Simply put, the more RIL claims to have spent on capital expenditure, the less the government gets as its share from the revenues, and more delayed is the timing when the government gets its revenues, RNRL said.        
	The Anil Ambani group company believes Reliance Industries has been padding costs to justify the gas sale price of $4.20 per million British thermal unit (mBtu)  which is 44 per cent higher than the price of $2.34 that Anil Ambani had negotiated with his brother in June 2005.         
	Sibal said the DGH had commissioned two studies  one by P. Gopalakrishnan, an Indian expert, and another by Mustang International, an international engineering consultant  to validate the capital expenditure proposed by RIL. Both had concurred with the estimates made by the gas explorer.         
	RNRL said Gopalakrishnan had, by his own admission, not even studied the production sharing contract (PSC) between the government and the contractor.        
	The DGH should publicly disclose the full reports of the CAG, Indian experts, international consultants, and independent auditors including their identity and process of their selection, and the terms of reference, RNRL said.

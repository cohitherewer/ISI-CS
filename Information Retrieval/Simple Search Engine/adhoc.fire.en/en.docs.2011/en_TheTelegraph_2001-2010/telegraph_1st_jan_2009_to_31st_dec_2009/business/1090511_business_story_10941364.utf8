                                                                                                                 Q amp;A      Retirement frills
                                Does the interest on retirement benefits such as gratuity, provident fund and leave salary fall under the purview of income tax, particularly when the beneficiary is 60 years of age? If yes, how is the tax calculated?           D. Ghosh, Calcutta 
                    A person below 65 years is not considered a senior citizen for calculation of income tax. The extent of tax exemption available to you on your retirement benefits will depend on whether you are a government or non-government employee. The retirement income from superannuation funds mentioned by you, except for gratuity, is fully tax-exempt for government employees. But for non-government employees, there are limits. The entire gratuity income and leave salary is totally tax-exempt for government employees. But for non-government employees, it is the least of the following: 10 months average salary or Rs 2,40,000. Provident fund and superannuation fund benefits are fully tax-exempt.                                   Gift in dollars      Is a gift in dollars from a son working in the US to his father exempt from income tax? If so, under which section?         S.K. Sen, Calcutta 
                    Gift tax act has been abolished. But when the donor is an NRI and the gift is in foreign exchange, the same will come under the purview of the Foreign Exchange Management Act. For gifts up to $200,000, one doesnt need FEMA or RBI clearance. But you should send a formal acknowledgement and thank you note to your son. Make sure, your son replies to your letter. Keep the letters as documents of the gift.                                   Tax query      Are deposits made under the Senior Citizens Savings Scheme deductible up to Rs 1 lakh under section 80C?         A. K. Chatterjee 
                    Deposits in the Senior Citizens Savings Scheme were made eligible for tax deduction under Section 80C from the current financial year. This means that any fresh investment in SCSS will be eligible for tax deduction under the said section up to Rs 1 lakh. Investments over and above Rs 1 lakh will not attract any benefit.

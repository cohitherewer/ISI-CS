The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Marginal cut in ATF prices
                                                                                                               Marginal cut in ATF prices
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, April 30: Oil companies today reduced jet fuel prices marginally, a move that is unlikely to see a drop in air fares. However, the cut may benefit companies like Air India that have slashed rates in select routes.        
	We are not considering cutting air fares. We had only recently cut fares on some sectors, an Air India spokesperson said. Jet Airways said it had not taken any decision on fare cut.        
	The oil companies reduced aviation turbine fuel (ATF) prices by Rs 331 per kilolitre as global crude fell during the fortnight.        
	State-run oil firms  Indian Oil, Bharat Petroleum and Hindustan Petroleum  revise jet fuel rates every fortnight based on trends in the international markets.        
	On April 16, ATF prices were increased by about 6.7 per cent, the third time in a row. The hike in jet fuel prices will vary from airport to airport, depending on local taxes and levies.

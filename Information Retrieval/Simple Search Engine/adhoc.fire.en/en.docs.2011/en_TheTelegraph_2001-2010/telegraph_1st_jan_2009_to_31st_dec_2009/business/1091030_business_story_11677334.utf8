The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Court poser on gas price 
                                                                                                               Court poser on gas price 
          OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT                          Tariff talk                                  
	New Delhi, Oct. 29: The Supreme Court today asked Reliance Industries why the company was not selling gas at $2.34 per million British thermal unit (mBtu) in public interest. Mukesh Ambanis RIL had refused to supply gas from the fields in the Krishna-Godavari basin to brother Anils Reliance Natural Resources Limited at $2.34 per mBtu, resulting in the case before the Supreme Court.        
	What if the government makes it (the selling price) $2.34, will it not serve public interest? Fertiliser, electricity and energy will all be cheaper (consequent to low gas costs) the country will be benefited, a three-judge bench said.         
	The apex court also sought to know the rationale for the government fixing the selling price at $4.2 per unit. Is it statutory, is it contractual? Whose interest did the government keep in mind while determining the price, Justice R.V. Raveendran asked RIL counsel Harish N. Salve.         
	 Salve said that RIL would have no option but to sell it at $2.34 if the government insisted on it, but it would be against RILs interests.         
	Spanish help        
	The government has appointed Spanish speciality consultancy firm Mercados Energy Markets International to examine the possibility of a uniform domestic price of natural gas, which is now sold at rates ranging from $1 to $5.73 per mBtu depending on source. The idea, a brainchild of petroleum secretary R.S. Pandey, aims to bring about uniformity in rates.

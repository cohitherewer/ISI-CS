                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Handicrafts exports jump 44%
                            
	New Delhi, Dec. 27 (PTI): Christmas orders for handmade items such as art metalware, woodware, paintings, zari and zari products have helped to turn the fortunes of the domestic handicrafts exporters for the third month in a row in November.        
	The exports of handicrafts  mostly shipped to the US and Europe  increased about 44 per cent in November to $44.81 million, according to the Export Promotion Council for Handicrafts (EPCH) data.        
	We expect the positive trend to continue. Inventories in western stores have exhausted and we expect fresh orders, EPCH executive director Rakesh Kumar said.        
	After 11 months of contraction since October 2008, handicraft exports turned positive from September. The segment employs one million people.        
	Shipments in September were up 177 per cent and October saw a 400 per cent jump, though on a low base of the comparable months of the previous year. In September, we did a good number of items for the Christmas season, Kumar said, adding that the good times will continue.

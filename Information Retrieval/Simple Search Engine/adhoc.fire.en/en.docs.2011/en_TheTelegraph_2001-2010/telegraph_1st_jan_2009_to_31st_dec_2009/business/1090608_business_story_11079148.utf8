	New Delhi, June 7: Television manufacturers are focussing on slim models.        
	In the past one-and-a-half months, Samsung and Sony have introduced thin sets.         
	Samsung launched the 29.9mm thin LED models. Sony followed with the launch of Bravia ZX1, a 9.9mm LCD set  the worlds thinnest  weighing approximately 15 kg.         
	LG Electronics India has recently launched energy-efficient models. The firm plans to launch 31 models  19 flat and 12 ultra-slim models.        
	We are seeing a drastic shift towards slim TVs in India. Slim TV is a huge hit since it fits perfectly into the Indian living room which is smaller in size than in the West. Slim TVs have the potential to become a mass market product in the next couple of years with a fall in their manufacturing cost, said M.B. Shin, managing director, LG Electronics India.        
	The width of a plain vanilla flat CRT (cathode ray tube) model is around 15.7 inch (400 mm). Manufacturers have shrunk the thickness to around 11.8 inch (300 mm) in a slim CRT TV.         
	On the other hand, the current thickness of LCD TVs sold in India is around 4.7 inch (121.1 mm), while that for LED TV it is just 1.16 inch (29.9 mm).         
	The new category of flat-panel televisions use LED (light emitting diode) technology as their primary light source rather than the traditional cold cathode fluorescent lamps, allowing higher contrast ratios and slim depths for better design.        
	Samsung expects its LED models to constitute 10 per cent of its overall flat panel television sales. It has set a target to sell one million slim CRT sets in 2009.         
	Rival LG Electronics plans to roll out its LED television range in India around July.        
	The companies believe a slimmer product portfolio will create a new growth driver in line with changing consumer preferences.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Funds lined up for broadband to villages 
                                                                                                               Funds lined up for broadband to villages 
          JAYATI GHOSE                          Growing network                                  
	New Delhi, June 7: The telecom department as part of the Bharat Nirman programme plans to dip into the universal service obligation fund to bring broadband to all the panchayats in the country.        
	 We will bring out a new USO policy where this fund can be used for other telecom-related services such as broadband and for laying fibre, telecom minister A. Raja said.         
	Since 2002, all telecom operators have been paying 5 per cent of their annual revenues towards this fund, which is for providing access to villages. So far, the unutilised amount in the universal service obligation (USO) fund has crossed Rs 25,000 crore.        
	President Pratibha Patil in her address to Parliament on Thursday said the government planned to expand broadband coverage to connect every panchayat to a broadband network in the next three years and increase phone usage in rural India four-fold in five years so that two out of every five villagers own phones.         
	The measures are part of the Bharat Nirman programme, a flagship project of the UPA government to improve infrastructure in villages.         
	As of April-end, rural India, which houses more than two-thirds of Indias population, had less than one-third of the countrys 430 million telephone connections.        
	The plans to improve rural connectivity will result in increased allocation from the USO fund for setting up telecom infrastructure in the countrys hinterlands, said telecom analyst Sudipto Basu.        
	DoT officials said apart from providing wireline broadband connectivity to all rural kiosks and rolling out WiMAX services in villages, the new USO policy would include plans to set up 5,500 telecom towers in remote areas, augment the optic fibre cable connectivity and fund technology innovations.        
	We also plan to fix a timeframe for exhausting this fund, and a liberal policy towards its utilisation will be the key, Raja said.

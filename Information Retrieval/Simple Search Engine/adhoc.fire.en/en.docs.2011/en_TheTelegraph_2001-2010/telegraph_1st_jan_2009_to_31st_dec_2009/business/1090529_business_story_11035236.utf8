The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Golden share set for debut

  - BANKS TO PROVIDE THE IDEAL LAUNCH PAD
				       OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                                  
	Mumbai, May 28: The concept of a golden share  a super-voting stock in the hands of the government  may finally get off the ground now that the Left is off the UPAs back.        
	Banking circles reckon that the government  which is wrestling with major social obligations  will soon push for a golden share in state-owned banks that need to raise capital to meet looming credit requirements.        
	The Reserve Bank of India has estimated that nationalised banks will need to raise Rs 3,70,000 crore over the next five years. The governments finances will be badly strained if it subscribes to new share flotations by banks just to maintain current stake levels.        
	A golden share will entitle the government with rights to intervene and veto any policy decision by the management.         
	The Margaret Thatcher government introduced the concept of a golden share in the 1980s when the UKs public sector entities were privatised. In India, the NDA government had considered the issue of a golden share to assuage the fears of workers when it divested its stake in some public sector units.        
	The biggest hurdle to a golden share is a legislative requirement that ordains government holding in public sector banks should be above 51 per cent. In the case of the State Bank of India, it must be above 55 per cent.        
	At present, the government holding in some banks is precariously close to the 51 per cent levels. For instance, it is 51.1 per cent in the case of Corporation Bank, 51.2 per cent in Dena Bank, 51.6 per cent in Andhra Bank, 53.8 per cent in Bank of Baroda and 53.9 per cent in Vijaya Bank.        
	Rajesh Mokashi, executive director at CARE Ratings, said the government would have to take a call on the 51 per cent stake floor.         
	Mokashi said alternative capital sources had their limitations and the growth of PSU banks would be impaired if capital constraint remained.        
	Alternatives include further dilution, special shares with majority voting rights and a straight-forward golden share, he said.        
	Two years ago, SBI chairman .P. Bhatt had strongly advocated the golden share concept as a way to allow under-capitalised banks to raise money and meet tough capital adequacy standards.        
	Mokashi said the merger of PSU banks might be one way to solve the capital constraint issue. For instance, a PSU bank in which the government has a large holding could be merged with a bank where the stake is around 51 per cent.        
	The CARE report said banks credit offtake would slow down in the next two years. Fresh credit demand will be hit by slower growth because of the recession in developed economies and sluggish economic demand. CARE expects growth in credit offtake to be 15-17 per cent for 2009-10 and 19-21 per cent for 2010-11.

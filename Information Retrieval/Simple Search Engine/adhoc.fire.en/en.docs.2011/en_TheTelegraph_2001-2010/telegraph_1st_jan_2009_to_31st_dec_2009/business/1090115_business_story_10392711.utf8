The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Posse hot on Satyam cash trail   KPMG, Deloitte to pore over accounts
                                                                                                               Posse hot on Satyam cash trail 
  KPMG, Deloitte to pore over accounts          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      Action tine                                
	Mumbai, Jan. 14: Satyam Computer Services today appointed Deloitte Haskins amp; Sells and KPMG  which rank among the Big Four accounting firms in the world  to restate the accounts of the troubled software services company.        
	However, these firms cannot be called the statutory auditors of the company. A statutory auditors appointment has to be cleared by the shareholders at the annual general meeting. PricewaterhouseCoopers and Ernst and Young are the other two that make up the Big Four.        
	A challenging task awaits Deloitte and KPMG as Ramalinga Raju has confessed that accounts were forged for several years. It is estimated that Raju fudged accounts for about seven years.        
	They will have to ascertain the bank balances, liabilities, find out how much is owed to the company and so on. This is a huge challenge given the enormity of the fraud committed and nobody is sure about the figures, said a source who did not wish to be identified. It is unusual to appoint two heavyweight auditors for a company and it wasnt immediately clear how they would dice up the responsibilities.        
	Deepak Parekh, chairman of HDFC and a newly appointed Satyam board member, had told reporters two days ago that two firms would be appointed to trawl figures for at least four to five years.         
	Parekh had said the auditors would also verify the veracity of the figures that Raju had given in his confessional statement in which he owned up to a Rs 7,136-crore fraud.         
	While Deloitte and KPMG officials were not available to comment on their appointment, accounting circles have been pressing for the appointment of an Indian firm as one of the auditors.        
	Under a 1949 law, foreign accounting firms have to operate in India through locally registered firms. While KPMG conducts its auditing business through Bharat S. Raut amp; Co, Deloitte Haskins has four firms under its umbrella: C.C. Choksi, P.C. Hansotia, A.F. Ferguson and Fraser amp; Ross. It wasnt clear which Deloitte associate would conduct the Satyam audit.        
	It is felt that the international presence of the two firms and the fact that they have also audited accounts of other domestic IT services companies could have tilted the balance in their favour. Satyam has offices in more than 60 countries.

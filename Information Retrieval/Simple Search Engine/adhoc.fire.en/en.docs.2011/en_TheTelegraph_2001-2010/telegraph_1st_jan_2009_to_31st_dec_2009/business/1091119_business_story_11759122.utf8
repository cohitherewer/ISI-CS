                                                                              Thursday , November 19 , 2009                                                                                                                                                                                            Tata keeps all options open on successor choice
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Tata: Planning for future                                  
	Mumbai, Nov. 18: Ratan Tata is scouting for his successor  and he isnt ruling out the prospect of an expatriate heading the $71-billion Tata group though he would prefer an Indian citizen.        
	Tata, who turns 72 this December, will stay in office till 2012 under rules that were changed in 2005 to extend the retirement age of non-executive directors within the group to 75 years.        
	In the mid-nineties, Ratan Tata had fixed the retirement age of non-executive directors at 70. People with executive responsibilities have to step down at 65.        
	The rule was used to force out ageing Tata satraps such as Russi Mody and Darbari Seth.        
	Group chairman Ratan Tata has often said he will step down when he turns 75.         
	His predecessor, J.R.D. Tata, officially retired in 1991 at the age of 87.         
	In an interview to the Wall Street Journal, Tata said he had appointed outside consultants to find his successor and the process was already underway.         
	Tata group officials said they had no inkling about the process and refused to comment on the latest development.        
	There was speculation within the group that an overseas consultant had been appointed. Global HR firm Egon Zehnder is one of the names that has surfaced as a possible hire for the job of finding the next chairman of the $71-billion conglomerate, which has 98 operating companies and 357,000 employees.        
	Tata isnt giving out too many clues about his successor.         
	In the interview, Tata said, In terms of who that successor might be, it could be he or she, it could be an internal or an external candidate. It would certainly be easier if that candidate were an Indian national. But now that 65 per cent of our revenues come from overseas, it could also be an expatriate sitting in that position with justification now that we are a company that has global reach and global presence.        
	Tata has left the field wide open as far as who the successor could be. Male or female, expatriate or Indian, from within the group or outside is a pretty broad definition, said a corporate watcher.         
	Tatas statement on his successor also does not rule the possibility of his step-brother and the equally media shy and low profile Noel Tata from taking over the mantle.         
	Noel Tata has been credited with turning Trent, which runs the Westside apparel chain, into a profitable retail player.         
	Commenting on his learning from the Singur experience, Tata said Bengal had an alien view of industrial development.         
	Now looking back I can only say that it is very unfortunate but we are better off being away from that scene than being in it.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Industry for simpler tax laws
                                                                                                               Industry for simpler tax laws
          GARIMA SINGH NEOGY                      Srinivasan: Awaiting relief                          
	New Delhi, April 1: Indian industry wants simpler tax laws to counter the menance of a parallel economy.        
	We will request the government to reform tax slabs, make fewer exemptions and make it easy to understand, Venu Srinivasan, newly elected president of the Confederation of Indian Industry (CII), told The Telegraph.        
	Srinivasans remark comes at a time when global leaders are meeting at the G20 summit in London to tighten the screws on tax havens where black money is often parked by the rich and powerful.         
	BJPs prime ministerial aspirant L. K. Advani, too, had recently asserted that if his party was voted to power, it would bring back Indian money held in secret bank accounts in tax havens abroad.        
	According to estimates, there is between Rs 25 lakh crore and Rs 70 lakh crore deposited in Swiss banks. If this money is brought back to India, it will enable us to settle many debts, Advani had said a few days ago.        
	Asked if the CII would discuss the issue with its member companies, Srinivasan said, An industry association cannot take any position other than calling for transparency in transactions. We are not a legislative body and can only advocate measures to our members.        
	Speaking on the G20 meet, where 20 most influential developed and developing countries would put their minds together to find a way out of the global crisis, Srinivasan said, We would want Western economies to bail out their industry. This in turn will help in the revival of our industry.        
	Also, the issue of protectionism should be taken up and sorted out, he said. Most nations, including India, have called for an end to protectionist trends.        
	In a meeting with Prime Minister Manmohan Singh last Saturday, corporate heads had supported Singhs stand that protectionism should be combated.        
	While growth had slowed down, Srinivasan said, the CII expected the economy to touch a GDP growth of 6.1-6.3 per cent for the current fiscal.

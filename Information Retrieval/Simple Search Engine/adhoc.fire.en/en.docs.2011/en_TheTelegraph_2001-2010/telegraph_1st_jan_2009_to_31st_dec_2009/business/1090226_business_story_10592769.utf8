The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Fuel fate linked to poll date
                                                                                                               Fuel fate linked to poll date
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                            
	New Delhi, Feb. 25: The government is considering a further cut in fuel prices as global crude is now ruling at a four-year low. However, with elections round the corner, the government wants to time the cut in a manner that gives it a maximum political advantage.        
	As of now there is no plan to cut prices. We have not yet decided on this, petroleum minister Murli Deora said. But, he did not rule out a review at a later date.        
	According to officials, the government may consider a cut before the election dates are announced, which is expected anytime after February 27. Alternatively, the government could seek special permission from the Election Commission to cut prices if crude dips below $35 per barrel. Crude is now hovering around $38-40 a barrel.        
	Through successive rounds of reduction in December and January, the government had already lowered petrol and diesel prices (per litre) by Rs 10 and Rs 4, respectively. It had also reduced the price of cooking gas by Rs 25 a cylinder.         
	When fuel prices were cut in January, the Indian basket of crude was averaging $44 a barrel. In the second half of February, its around $43 a barrel.        
	The officials said the petroleum ministry was trying to place the price-cut issue before the Cabinet at the earliest. The Cabinet is expected to meet this week and if the political decision is in favour of a price cut, the note could be pushed, they said.        
	Officials said if there was a review this month, the government would cut diesel prices by about Rs 2 to 3 per litre. However, if it chooses to wait till the middle of next month, the government may cut both petrol and diesel prices substantially.        
	Meanwhile, the eighth round of the auction of oil and gas blocks under the New Exploration Licensing Policy is likely to be announced by mid-April, petroleum secretary R. S. Pandey said.        
	A small number of blocks will be put up for bidding initially.

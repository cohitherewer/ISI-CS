The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | NTPC keen to buy gas
                                                                                                               NTPC keen to buy gas
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, June 23: Power producer NTPC said it was willing to buy gas from Reliance Industries (RIL) at $4.2 million metric British thermal unit (mBtu) except for the plants under dispute.        
	We are open to buying at market prices, without prejudice to our cases over the Kawas and Gandhar projects, NTPC chairman R.S. Sharma said. The companies are involved in a legal battle over a gas supply agreement reached in 2005, under which RIL was to supply gas to NTPCs Kawas and Gandhar units in Gujarat at a lower price.         
	NTPC plans to buy 2.67 million standard cubic metres of gas per day for its gas-based plants. Bombay High Court has asked RIL to supply 28 million metric cubic metres per day of gas for 17 years to Anil Ambanis Reliance Natural Resources Ltd at $2.34 per mBtu the price at which RIL had also agreed to supply to NTPC.

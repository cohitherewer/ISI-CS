	New Delhi, Aug. 23 (PTI): The Pension Fund Regulatory and Development Authority (PFRDA) is preparing a separate fund management guideline for corporate entities.         
	The move will enable companies to enter into agreements with fund managers for managing the funds of their employees. The road map on corpus management will be announced in the next three to four months, a PFRDA official said.        
	Requests by big employers such as the Indian Banks Association and the State Bank of India prompted the regulator to work out a separate guideline for corporates and other entities.        
	The SBI has approached the regulator for managing the retirement money of its employees. The Indian Banks Association has also shown interest in joining the New Pension Scheme for new recruits. Some self-help groups and PSUs have also approached the PFRDA for the management of their corpus.        
	Discussions with them are on but no concrete decision have been taken so far, the official said.        
	The new pension system was implemented for government employees who joined service on or after January 1, 2004. On May 1 this year, it was extended to all citizens.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Govt clears air on FDI rule tweak
                                                                                                               Govt clears air on FDI rule tweak
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                             
	New Delhi, April 28: The relaxation announced in foreign direct investment (FDI) regulations in February will not supersede existing sectoral investment caps, government officials said today.        
	Putting a lid on another controversy, the officials said banks, pension funds and insurance companies would be kept out of the purview of the new rules.        
	In February, the government issued a press note that permitted holding companies with a foreign ownership of up to 50 per cent to float downstream ventures which would be treated as local entities.        
	The rule change sparked controversy because it implied that investments in downstream venture made by entities where foreign ownership exceeded 51 per cent would then not be treated as Indian firms.        
	It immediately put financial services companies like ICICI Bank and HDFC in a spot. Both outfits have a foreign stakeholding in excess of 51 per cent. This created a piquant situation since any investment the two financial service companies made in other entities would immediately force the latter to shed their Indian tag. This would come at a cost because the corporate tax structure in India favours local companies. Indian companies pay a corporate tax of 33.99 per cent, while the effective tax paid by a foreign firm is 42 per cent.        
	Officials said the new rules  elaborated in Press Note 2 of 2009  would not supersede older rules that bar foreign firms from investing in the retail business, limit them to 74 per cent stake in telecom and to even less in aviation.        
	The sectoral caps will remain, top officials in the department of industrial policy told The Telegraph. Our rules do not allow indirect investment in these sectors (aviation, retail, insurance, banking and finance).        
	In the final notification which will come out shortly, we will also keep the three sensitive financial sectors  banking, insurance and pension  out of the purview of these norms. We really fail to see why there is so much unnecessary confusion on this.        
	Recently, ICICI wrote to the department seeking clarification on the new rules. The rule for calculating indirect FDI will be applicable to sectors where there is an FDI cap but not to sectors where 100 per cent FDI is allowed. Several sectors such as telecom, airlines and retail have such sectoral caps and indirect FDI is calculated as a percentage of investment by any Indian firm in companies in these sectors.        
	Officials admitted that there was a need to clarify that American depository rights and global depository rights, which do not carry voting rights and are classified by the RBI as bonds, would not be taken into account as foreign investment holding in special sectors such as banking. The new rules had defined these as foreign investment.         
	Officials said the new norms were meant to simplify procedures and understanding but not to give more rights to foreign investors.         
	At this point of time, giving away rights in sensitive sectors like banking does not make sense. Nobody really wants to invest anywhere outside his home country right now. Besides we will be bargaining on opening up the financial sector soon with the West in trade talks. Why should we give away anything now, asked finance ministry officials.        
	However, analysts said issues relating to the terms like owned and controlled had not been addressed in the new policy. Moreover, the press note does not define the term beneficial ownership, which forms the cornerstone of the new guidelines.        
	There are different permutations and combinations of ownership and control and that has really not been addressed, which will probably lead to significant confusion going forward, analysts said.        
	The government hopes to garner $30 billion in FDI commitments this year. The inflow of $23.9 billion between April-January indicates that last years scaled-down target of $35 billion is unlikely to be met.         
	After maintaining robust inflows till September  with a monthly range of $2.5-3 billion  FDI in October slipped to $1.4 billion and to $1.08 in November. Last year, the total inflow was $24.5 billion.

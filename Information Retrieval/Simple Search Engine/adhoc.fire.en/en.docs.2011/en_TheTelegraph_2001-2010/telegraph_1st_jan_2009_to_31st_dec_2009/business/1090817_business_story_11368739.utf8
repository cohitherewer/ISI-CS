	New Delhi, Aug. 16: Hotel chains are mulling a 6-10 per cent hike in room tariffs in the next two months on the back of increased business travel.         
	Chains including The Taj Group, Oberoi Trident, Lalit Hotels, The Leela Palaces, Hotels amp; Resort and The Claridges expect corporate and leisure travel to pick up in the winter season.        
	Corporate travel is expected to show signs of improvement. So there will be a marginal adjustment of prices. It will go up anywhere between 6 per cent and 10 per cent by September or October. Our room occupancy, which is now ruling between 58 per cent and 60 per cent, is also expected to go up to 75 per cent in October, Sanjay Pasricha, vice-president (sales and marketing), The Leela Palaces, Hotels amp; Resorts told The Telegraph.         
	Shobu Mathew, vice-president (sales) of the Lalit Suri Hospitality Group, said, We will certainly see some hikes in tariffs, about 10 per cent, in our properties in Delhi, Mumbai and Bangalore. There are enough indications that the second half of the year will be good.        
	A senior official of Trident, Delhi said, We are already getting a lot of bookings for October and November. While our rates this summer were 20 per cent less than last year at Rs 11,500, it should be around Rs 16,000 for the winter season, same as last year. Room occupancy, too, may touch 90 per cent.        
	Hotels provided 30-40 per cent discount in the first half of the current year because of a low demand and falling occupancies.         
	This had a cascading impact on the profitability of the hospitality majors in the first quarter ended June 30, 2009.        
	According to analysts, revenue per available room  the true indicator of the performance of hotels  crashed 33-35 per cent.         
	While average room rates fell 18-20 per cent, occupancy was down to around 50-55 per cent against 65-70 per cent in the year-ago period.        
	Sanjeev Shukla, general manager (sales and marketing) of The Claridges, New Delhi, said, The economy has started showing signs of revival, though slow. We are expecting an increase in business compared with the current quarter and therefore have decided to hike room tariff.

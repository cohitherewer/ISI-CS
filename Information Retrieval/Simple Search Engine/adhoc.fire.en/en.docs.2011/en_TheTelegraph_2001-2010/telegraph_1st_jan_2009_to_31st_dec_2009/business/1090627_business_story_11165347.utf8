          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Mumbai, June 26: The market for initial public offerings (IPOs)  which has been dormant for close to a year  has sparked to life again with Mahindra Holidays amp; Resorts Indias flotation being subscribed 10 times over.        
	The company had come out with an IPO of 92.65 lakh shares in a price band of Rs 275-325 per share.        
	Data available from the National Stock Exchange at 5pm showed the IPO had received bids for 9,02,06,500 shares.        
	Capital market circles said the subscription would cross the 10-times mark as more data poured in.        
	The IPO received a good response from qualified institutional buyers (QIB) and non- institutional investors, including corporate buyers.         
	However, the response from retail investors remained lukewarm. Investment bankers said the retail subscription would also rise since individuals preferred to hang on till the very last minute as they waited for some indication on the cut-off price.        
	The qualified institutional bidders portion was subscribed 1.09 times, while the non-institutional investor category had bid over 1.27 times. The retail portion had been subscribed 0.25 times till reports last came in.        
	The QIBs bid for 60,76,200 shares against 55,59,165 shares reserved for the category, while non-institutional investors bid for 11,78,400 shares against 9,26,527 shares. The retail investors bid for 7,03,940 shares against 27,79,582 shares earmarked for the category.        
	Mahindra Holidays plans to utilise the proceeds to fund expansion, which includes setting up of new projects.        
	Market circles said the success of the issue indicated that there was an appetite for IPOs of good companies, provided the offering came at a decent price and was not expensive.

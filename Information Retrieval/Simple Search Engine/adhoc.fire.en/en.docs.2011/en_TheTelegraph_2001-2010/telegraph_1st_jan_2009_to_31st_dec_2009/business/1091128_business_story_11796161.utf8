          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Mumbai, Nov. 27: Reliance Communications today fired another salvo in the telecom rate war with two new plans: the first to slash the cost of an SMS to one paise per message, and the second to offer unlimited SMS for just one rupee a day.        
	The new SMS plans will apply to all local, national and roaming customers. It will cover messages sent to any network.         
	The two new plans take the rate war into a new arena. Until now, the war has been focused on the voice segment after Tata DoCoMo slashed call costs with its per second billing plan.        
	Last week, telecom minister A. Raja wondered why the rate war wasnt spilling over to the SMS segment. Now it has.        
	The Anil Ambani firms new SMS tariff plans are add-on schemes and will be applicable to all mobile customers of Reliance Communications, irrespective of whether they are on the GSM or the CDMA network.        
	With select subscriber groups, SMS is a preferred communication mode over voice calls. On account of a significant tariff disparity in recent months, it has lost its due share of attention, said Mahesh Prasad, president of R-Com.        
	We aim to revitalise SMS usage in the country, he added.        
	All Reliance Mobile customers  there are 92 million at present  will be able to get one paise per SMS plan by subscribing to a standard tariff voucher of Rs 11 per month.        
	The unlimited SMS plan will entail a daily deduction of one rupee a day from the pre-paid balance.        
	For post-paid customers, the one paise per SMS pack will cost Rs 11 a month. The unlimited SMS pack will, however, cost Rs 25 per month.        
	The tariffs are applicable for non-commercial use. The company said it would put a fair usage cap of 15,000 SMSs per month under the unlimited plan to deter telemarketers from taking advantage of this offer.        
	Last month, Reliance Mobile offered a flat rate of 50 paise per minute for local, STD and roaming calls.        
	It then took a cue from Tata DoCoMo and offered one paise per second billing plan for local, STD and roaming calls.        
	The telecom rate war has badly crimped margins in the telecom industry.

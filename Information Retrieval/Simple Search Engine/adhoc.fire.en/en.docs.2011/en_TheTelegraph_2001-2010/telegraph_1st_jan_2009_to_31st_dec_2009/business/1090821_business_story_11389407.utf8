The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Bharti, MTN need to talk more
                                                                                                               Bharti, MTN need to talk more
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Aug. 20: Merger talks between Sunil Mittals Bharti Airtel and South Africas MTN to create the worlds third-largest mobile operator will now continue till September 30. Though this is the second time that the deadline has been extended, Bharti has said, the discussions may or may not lead to any transaction.         
	In separate statements, both Bharti and MTN said discussions continued to progress satisfactorily, though no decision had been taken to acquire shares or implement the potential transaction.        
	Bharti and MTN had resumed talks on merger in May, a year after the previous attempt broke down over who would control the merged entity.        
	Initially the two telecom firms had set July 31 as the time limit to complete their exclusive merger talks. Later the deadline was pushed back to August 31. Now both have agreed to continue talking till September end.        
	Sources close to the deal said the extension was because of the demand of some MTN shareholders for a sweetened offer from the Indian company.        
	The proposed merger will create a telecom giant with revenues of more than $20 billion a year and a customer base of over 200 million in India, Africa and West Asia.        
	While analysts are puzzled over the delay, sources said, Some directors of MTN want the whole deal to be restructured so that there is more value in it for the MTN shareholders.        
	According to the sources, the MTN management and some shareholders want Bharti to pay around $1 billion more.         
	MTN will need the approval of at least 75 per cent of its shareholders for the deal to be successful.        
	South Africas Public Investment Corporation, MTNs largest shareholder with more than a 20 per cent stake, had earlier said it supported the deal in principle but indicated that it expected a higher price from Bharti.         
	It had also raised concern over the extent of MTNs influence on the merged entity.         
	Pricing, management representation and Bharti GDRs not wanted by MTN shareholders could be some issues still under debate, said analysts.        
	In a complex cash and share swap deal, Bharti will pick up a 49 per cent stake in MTN, and the South African firm and its shareholders will get a 36 per cent economic interest in the Mittal company.        
	If successful, the transaction will be Indias biggest overseas deal, surpassing Tata Steels acquisition of Corus for $12.2 billion in 2007.        
	A combined entity will be the third-biggest mobile operator in the world, based on subscribers, behind China Mobile and Vodafone. Its annual sales of $20 billion will be less than China Mobiles $60 billion and Vodafones $65 billion.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Air India strike threat
                                                                                                               Air India strike threat
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                          Turbulence                                  
	New Delhi, June 17: Air Indias employees have threatened to go on a strike on June 30 to protest the companys decision to delay their salaries.        
	Air India officials, however, said the strike was unlikely to take place. Earlier, Air India director Jitendra Bhargava had said the airline would be paying the June salaries on July 15 instead of the first of the month because of a temporary cash crunch.        
	The state-run airline, which is likely to report a massive loss of around Rs 4,300 crore for fiscal 2008-09, is facing a temporary cash flow imbalance.         
	Members of the Air Corporation Employees Union (ACEU), the Aviation Industry Employees Guild and the Indian Aircraft Technicians Association will jointly boycott work on June 30 by adopting a no pay, no work policy if the management fails to give us our salary on June 30, said J.B. Kadiyan, general secretary of ACEU.        
	Since everyone will be joining the protest, there will not be any movement of the airlines aircraft on that day, Kadiyan said.        
	The ACEU is the largest trade union of Air India employees with over 22,000 members. National Aviation Company of India Ltd, which owns Air India, has about 31,000 employees.

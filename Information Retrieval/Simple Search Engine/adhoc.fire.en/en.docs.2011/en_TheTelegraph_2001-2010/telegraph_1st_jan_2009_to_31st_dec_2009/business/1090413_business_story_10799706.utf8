The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Plot thickens
                                                                                                                 Q amp;A      Plot thickens
                                I had bought a plot of land for Rs 5 lakh in 1996 and sold it for Rs 25 lakh early last year. What will be my capital gains tax liability?          Sudhir Chatterjee, Calcutta
                    Assuming that you had acquired the property in 1996-97 financial year and sold it before March 2008, the cost inflation index ratio for the acquisition value of the property will be 551 divided by 305, or 1.8066. Thus, your cost of acquiring the property for the purpose of tax calculation will be Rs 5 lakh multiplied by 1.8066, or Rs 9.033 lakh. The capital gain is, therefore, Rs 25 lakh minus Rs 9.033 lakh, or Rs 15.967 lakh. Your capital gains tax liability will be 20 per cent of Rs 15.967 lakh, or Rs 3.1934 lakh.                                  Be at ease      I bought some shares 30 years ago. I have no demat account. Can I sell these shares by opening a demat and trading account? What are the rules? How much tax do I have to pay?        Kamal Nandi, Salt Lake
                    Yes, you can sell those shares and you dont have to pay any tax on the capital gain from the sale. First, you will have to open a demat account and then convert the paper scrips into a dematerialised form. Almost all banks offer the demat service. The dematerialised shares can be sold through a brokerage house registered with the BSE or the NSE. Since you are holding these stocks for more than a year, there will be no capital gains tax liability.                                   NSS account      I am 76 years old and my annual income is Rs 1.5 lakh. I have an NSS account for the last 15 years with the GPO. If I withdraw the full amount from the account, including an interest of Rs 60,000, will there be any tax deduction at source?         Samir Chatterjee, Calcutta 
                    Till 2003, the income from NSS account, including interest, was taxable on withdrawal at the rate of 20 per cent at source. However, after the 14th amendment of the income-tax rules in 2003, senior citizens with no taxable income can submit Form 15H with a self-declaration and there will be no tax deduction at source on the NSS maturity.

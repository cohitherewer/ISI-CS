The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Lukewarm response to TechM open offer
                                                                                                               Lukewarm response to TechM open offer
                            
	New Delhi, July 1 (PTI): Tech Mahindras open offer for up to 20 per cent in erstwhile Satyam Computer Services ended today without any significant response from the shareholders.        
	The 20 per cent in Satyam would have cost Tech Mahindra Rs 1,154 crore.        
	Tech Mahindra has not received a significant response to its tender offer to purchase 20 per cent of Satyam Computer Services from the shareholders, Tech Mahindras chief financial officer Sonjoy Anand said.        
	The company said in a regulatory filing that the final number of shares tendered and accepted (including shares underlying American Depository Shares) will be announced on or about July 8, 2009.        
	If the aggregate number of shares tendered and accepted in the offer is less than the offer size, Tech Mahindra intends to subscribe to additional Satyam shares so that it matches the offer size, the company said.        
	The company would subscribe to the additional shares at a price of Rs 58 a piece, in accordance with the share subscription agreement with Satyam.        
	It is likely that Tech Mahindra would subscribe to the fresh equity shares of Mahindra Satyam (the new name for Satyam Computer) to raise its stake in the company from the current 31 per cent.         
	The company will have to take further regulatory approval to issue the fresh equity shares, which can take two to three weeks.        
	The process of calculating the number of shares validly tendered and not withdrawn in the tender offer, including shares underlying Satyams American Depository Shares is being carried out by the registrar to the offer, along with Tech Mahindra and some other agents.

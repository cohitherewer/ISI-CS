	Calcutta, Dec. 20: Indian industry is set to voluntarily follow the guidelines of the Confederation of Industry (CII) on corporate governance.        
	Based on the experience, the corporate affairs ministry will make these guidelines mandatory a year later, said Shardul S. Shroff, managing partner of corporate law firm Amarchand Mangaldas and a member of the Naresh Chandra-led CII committee.         
	The Institute of Company Secretaries of India (ICSI) has also submitted its recommendations on governance.         
	The government would also take note of the views of the ICSI, which had submitted its report this month.        
	The CII panel has suggested the introduction of a nomination committee, comprising a majority of independent directors, including the chairman. This committee will appoint the executive and non-executive directors.        
	The ICSI report recommends a maximum six-year term for independent directors against nine years permitted under Sebi rules and eight years under the banking regulation act.        
	Both the ICSI and the Naresh Chandra committee stressed that nominee directors should be excluded from the definition of independent directors. Though the Companies Bill 2009 recognises this, Sebi rules treat nominee directors as independent.        
	According to the CII panel, independent and non-executive directors should get a fixed contractual remuneration, subject to a ceiling.         
	The ICSI wants the board to evaluate the performance of individual members.        
	Both the reports stressed on the need for separating the offices, duties and responsibilities of the chairman and the chief executive officer.

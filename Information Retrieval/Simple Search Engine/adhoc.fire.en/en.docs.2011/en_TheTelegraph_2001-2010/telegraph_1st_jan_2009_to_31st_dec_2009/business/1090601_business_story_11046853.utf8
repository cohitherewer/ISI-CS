The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Price pinch spoils the morning cuppa
                                                                                                               Price pinch spoils the morning cuppa
          A STAFF REPORTER                          Crisis brews                                  
	Calcutta, May 31: Retail tea prices are set to go up by Rs 20 per kg as bad weather has hurt production and raised auction prices.         
	Western India Tea Dealers Association (WITDA) will be the first to hike prices. The association confirmed that retail prices would rise by Rs 15-20 per kg because of higher prices at the auctions.         
	Traders in north Bengal will also raise prices.         
	The dealers will have to pass on this higher procurement price to consumers. I feel the commerce ministry should intervene to address the situation. If needed, the newly elected government should allow us to import tea from Sri Lanka, WITDA chairman Piyush . Desai said.        
	However, Indias southern neighbour has been hit by drought. The country has faced a shortfall of 33.9 million kg in January-March 2009.         
	There has been an increase of Rs 20 at each price level. If the price was Rs 100 per kg then, it has gone up to Rs 120 while those that fetched Rs 140 per kg are selling at Rs 160, a statement by Bishnu Tea Company said.        
	The average price at the auctions in April last year was Rs 87.04, which has now increased to Rs 113.74. The average price in the just concluded sale number 19 in Guwahati was Rs 131.01.         
	Desai said that only 15-20 per cent of the area under cultivation was faced with a drought-like situation. The production of tea is not as low as that projected by the producers.         
	However, the weather is yet to improve in Assam and north Bengal. The Tea Association of India said the worst-ever drought had struck in parts of Dooars and a major portion of Terai.         
	A major crop loss till the end of April has already taken place in the tea growing districts of north Bengal. With very scanty rainfall recorded in the month of May so far, a further crop loss to the tune of 30 per cent is apprehended in the current month, too, in major portions of Terai and parts of Dooars, an industry source said.        
	India is facing a shortage of 60 million kg. The deficit in Assam in March-April was 10-15 per cent, but with adequate rainfall it could be brought down to some extent.         
	Prices of green leaf have shot up 70 per cent over the prices in the corresponding period of the previous year, considerably squeezing the margin of profit of the factories.

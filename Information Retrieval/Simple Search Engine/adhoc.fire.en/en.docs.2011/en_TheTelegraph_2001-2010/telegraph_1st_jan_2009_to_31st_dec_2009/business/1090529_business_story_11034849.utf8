          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Mumbai, May 28: JSW Steel Ltd plans to raise up to $1 billion (about Rs 4,775 crore) through a qualified institutional placement and by issuing foreign currency convertible bonds.        
	The company plans to raise these long-term resources to part-finance its capital expenditure and reduce debt on its books.        
	In a notice to the Bombay Stock Exchange, JSW Steel said the money would be raised in tranches.         
	The shares of the company surged 6.53 per cent on the BSE today. Shares soared to a high of Rs 596 before settling at Rs 549.65.         
	Earlier this month, JSW Steel had announced a Rs 39.93-crore loss on a consolidated basis in the fourth quarter of the last fiscal on the back of a contraction of demand in the US.         
	The company, however, recorded a Rs 49.2-crore profit on a standalone basis in the said period compared with Rs 370.18-crore profit in the same period of the previous year.

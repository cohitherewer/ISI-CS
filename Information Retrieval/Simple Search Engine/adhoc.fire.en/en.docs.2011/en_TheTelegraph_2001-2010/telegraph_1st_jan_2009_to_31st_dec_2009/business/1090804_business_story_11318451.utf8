          OUR CORRESPONDENT                          H.S. Lheem in New Delhi on Monday. (PTI)                                  
	New Delhi, Aug. 3: Hyundai Motor India will increase its manufacturing capacity by 20 per cent and hire 1,000 people this month at its two plants in Chennai.         
	The hiring will push the companys total workforce up to above 12,000. Last month, Hyundai increased its output by about 25 per cent and the workforce by over 1,000 employees at the plants.        
	We have started the third shift from July 10 at Plant-I, for which we hired over 1,000 people. We will start the third shift at Plant-II from September 14 and induct another 1,000 people this month, said H.S. Lheem, managing director and CEO, Hyundai Motor India.        
	The company is producing about 2,000 units per day, which will go up by 400 units once the third shift at Plant-II starts.        
	We had very good sales in July. In domestic sales, we increased over 50 per cent and sold more than 23,000 units, he said.         
	Hyundai has sold 45,543 units in July, of which 22,350 cars were exported. At its research centre in Hyderabad, it plans to increase the headcount to 800 from 210.        
	On the export front, Hyundai has asked the government to provide incentives.        
	The Korean government has signed a free trade agreement with the members of the European Union. The actual import duties of all smaller cars within five years and bigger cars within three years will be nullified in the EU countries, said Lheem.        
	The Indian government should consider a free trade agreement with the EU or provide the same amount of incentives, otherwise we will lose out to Korean products, he said.

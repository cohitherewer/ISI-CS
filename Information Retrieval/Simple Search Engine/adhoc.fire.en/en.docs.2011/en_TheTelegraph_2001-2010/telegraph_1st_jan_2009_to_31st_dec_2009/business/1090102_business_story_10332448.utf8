                                                                                                               Push for higher 3G fee
                            
	New Delhi, Jan. 1 (PTI): The finance ministry today asked the department of telecom (DoT) to double the reserve price for all-India 3G spectrum to Rs 4,040 crore.        
	In a note to telecom secretary Siddhartha Behura, the ministry of finance said, The reserve price may be increased to Rs 4,040 crore from Rs 2,020 crore for a pan-India allocation of two blocks of 5MHz of 3G spectrum.        
	The ministry wants the DoT to incorporate the revised price in the proposal before placing it before the Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs.        
	DoT officials, however, said any change in the reserve price might require the Telecom Regulatory Authority of Indias approval.        
	The finance ministry has also sought to double the reserve price for wireless broadband to Rs 2,000 crore for a pan-India allocation. The DoT had recommended a price of Rs 1,000 crore.        
	Sources said the finance ministry had also questioned the rationale of limiting the auction of only four slots of spectrum in each circle.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Tax liability nil
                                                                                                                 Q amp;A      Tax liability nil
                                I am 67-years-old. My estimated annual income during 2008-09 will be Rs 1,90,000, which will include a pension income of Rs 1 lakh, interest income of Rs 75,000 and income from capital gains of Rs 15,000. What will be my tax liability? If I dont have to pay any tax, do I have to file returns?           Mrinal Dasgupta, Konnagar
                    The annual income limit for income tax purposes for people above 65 years is Rs 2,25,000 . Your total annual income in financial year 2008-09, including capital gains, will be less than the basic exemption limit. This means you dont have to pay any income tax. Filing returns is voluntary for people with no taxable income.                                   File returns      I am 72-years-old. My total income, including pension and interest on FDs, post office MIS and SCSS, will be about Rs 2.4 lakh in 2008-09. But my tax liability became zero after I deposited Rs 50,000 in PPF. Can I submit Form 15H to my bank for non-deduction of interest at source on SCSS and FDs?        Tapan Das, Howrah
                      Under Section 197A(1C) of the Income Tax Act, an individual who is 65 or more can submit Form 15H in duplicate declaring that he or she has no taxable income and hence no tax should be deducted at source from accrued interest. However, under Section 139, you will have to file returns because your income is more than Rs 2,25,000.                                       Interest income      I earn Rs 1,20,000 as annual pension. If I invest Rs 15 lakh in SCSS, I will earn Rs 1,35,000 as interest income every year. My total income will be Rs 2,55,000. Will my interest income be tax-free? What will be my tax liability?        Sunil Roy, Calcutta
                      Interest income from SCSS has never been tax-free. Investment up to Rs 1 lakh in SCSS is eligible for deduction under Section 80C. You can claim a deduction of up to Rs 1 lakh from your total income by investing in SCSS. In that case, your tax liability will be zero if you are more than 65 years of age. If your age is less than 65 years, your tax liability will be 10.3 per cent of Rs 5,000, or Rs 515.

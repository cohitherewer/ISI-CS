The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Ficci sees early end to export misery 
                                                                                                               Ficci sees early end to export misery 
                            
	New Delhi, Aug. 16 (PTI): Indian exporters can expect a reasonable growth by December with European and Asian countries such as France, Germany and Hong Kong pulling themselves out of the downward spiral, a survey by the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry (Ficci), said.        
	A majority of respondents in the survey said exports were expected to be in positive terrain by December this year.        
	The chamber expects an improvement but only in terms of stemming the falling exports on a year-to-year basis in the months ahead.        
	Exports are likely to register a reasonable positive growth but we will have to wait at least till the end of this year, the survey said.        
	Exports have declined 26 per cent in June on less demand from the global markets.         
	Countries such as Hong Kong, Germany and France are showing fresh signs of recovery, with both the European countries recording a marginal GDP growth of 0.3 per cent and the Asian economy expanding 3.3 per cent in the second quarter of 2009.        
	The survey said, While orders are not coming in thick and fast, still some foreign clients have started placing some new orders or at least reduced the pace of order cancellation.        
	Ficci surveyed 316 exporters in different sectors such as automotive, gems and jewellery, textiles, handicrafts, leather and marine IT products during June and July 2009.         
	Expert view         
	Mirroring Ficci, a finance ministry official sounded upbeat on external trade.        
	Senior economic adviser to the finance ministry H.A.C. Prasad said that though exports fell for the nine month in a row in June, there were early signs of recovery in overseas sales, which could register growth from September onwards.        
	Prasad based his hypothesis on the sequential growth witnessed in exports in May and June.        
	While exports growth compared with the corresponding month in the previous year continues to be negative for the ninth month in a row, export growth in June 2009 over May 2009 is positive at 16.4 per cent. This is in continuation of the positive month-over-month trend in May 2009 (of 2.4 per cent), Prasad said.        
	Hit by recession, exports started contracting from October onwards on a yearly basis.

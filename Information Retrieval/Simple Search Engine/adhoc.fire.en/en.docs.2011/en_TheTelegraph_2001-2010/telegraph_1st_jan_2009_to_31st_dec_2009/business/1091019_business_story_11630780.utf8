	New Delhi, Oct. 18: Punebased Kinetic Motors plans to enter the electrical goods and consumer durables businesses. Kinetic, one of Indias oldest automotive brands, had earlier partially exited from two-wheelers.         
	The company is in the final stages of drafting its plans. It will also review its auto component business.         
	For the last five to six years, Kinetic has been working on a restructuring plan. We are a very strong brand and now want to venture into a totally new area like home automation. Also, we will renew our focus on our existing auto component business. You will soon see us entering peoples home directly. We are sure our products will be very well received by customers, Sulajja Firodia Motwani, managing director of Kinetic Motors, told The Telegraph.        
	Motwani, however, refused to divulge details about the new product line.         
	According to sources, the company may look at generator and inverters to begin with. Later, it will also look into the auto accessory market. Strategies for consumer durables  a market dominated by Korean companies  will be based on its experience in generators, inverters and car accessories.         
	Our first product should be out in the market in the next three to four months, said Motwani.        
	Last year, utility vehicles leader Mahindra amp; Mahindra (M amp;M) had announced its entry in the two-wheeler segment by acquiring an 80 per cent stake in Kinetic Motor Company Ltd.         
	Kinetic continues to hold a 20 per cent stake in the new company  Mahindra Kinetic Scooters amp; Motorcycles Ltd.

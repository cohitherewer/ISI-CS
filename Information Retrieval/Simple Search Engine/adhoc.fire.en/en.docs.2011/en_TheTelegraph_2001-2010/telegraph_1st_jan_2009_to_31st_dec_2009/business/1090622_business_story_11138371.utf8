                                                                                                               Choose with caution
        Money-back policies may not be the right cover plan for you, says Srikumar Bondyopadhyay                                            
	Money-back policies are perhaps the most popular among all endowment life insurance plans sold in the country.         
	However, policyholders often ignore the relative cost benefits offered by other life cover plans compared with the money-back policies.        
	What prompts people to choose a money-back policy over other life insurance plans?         
	A money-back policyholder gets redemption of the sum assured at regular intervals during the term of the policy.         
	In the case of death of the policyholder during the policy term, the full sum assured is given without deducting the survival benefits already paid.         
	In other endowment plans, the survival benefits accrue to the policyholder only at the maturity of the policy. Thus, if a policyholder dies during the policy term, the nominee gets only the death benefits.        
	In a money-back policy, a policyholder gets a lump sum amount at regular intervals and this is considered to be a great help in meeting financial liabilities such as childrens education or their marriage.         
	Seek new options        
	There are, however, other options that promise a better return on investment, and one should avoid money-back plans in ones portfolio.         
	Let us explain why.         
	The table shows the annual premium a 30-year-old will have to pay for a policy having a sum assured of Rs 5 lakh for a term of 20 years. The premium rates will be higher if you want to pay it in a monthly, quarterly or half-yearly mode.        
	It shows that if the policyholder survives the policy term, the total premium paid to keep the policy in force is much higher than the sum assured. On survival of the policy term, the policyholder will get the sum assured plus guaranteed additions, if any, plus vested bonuses.         
	Let us now consider the illustration that life insurance companies use themselves to calculate the benefit accrued to a policyholder.         
	Take for example, Kotak Life Insurance Company. If a 30-year-old person takes a Kotak Money-Back Plan for a sum assured of Rs 5 lakh for a 20-year term, his annual premium will be Rs 34,124. That means, his total premium outgo is Rs 6,82,480.        
	What he gets back on survival of the policy term is Rs 5 lakh as sum assured (paid in different tranches during the policy term) plus Rs 1.5 lakh guaranteed addition (paid on maturity) and reversionary bonus (payable on maturity).         
	According to the companys own illustration, the total bonus addition at the rate of 6 per cent will be Rs 1,60,900 and at the rate of 10 per cent, Rs 5,22,000. Thus, total benefits received by the policyholder will be Rs 8,10,900, if the company gives bonus at the rate of 6 per cent, and Rs 11,72,600, if the bonus rate is 10 per cent.        
	Private life insurer Bajaj Allianz Life Insurance Companys total payout varies between Rs 7,66,019 (6 per cent bonus) and Rs 10,72,919 (10 per cent bonus) against a total premium of Rs 7,79,700.        
	Bonus point        
	Private life insurers have not given more than 5 per cent bonus consistently on their money-back plans. Even LIC gave bonus at the rate of around 4 per cent in the past five to six years, though it announces a hefty terminal bonus of 30-40 per cent.         
	The benefit illustration of LIC shows that a 35-year-old person will get between Rs 93,000 and Rs 1,46,000 as the total payout, including annual bonuses at the rate of 6 per cent or 10 per cent (as the case may be), on a policy with a sum assured of Rs 1 lakh for a policy term of 20 years.         
	The investor, however, will have to pay a total premium of Rs 1,31,280 during the 20 years.         
	If we add a 30 per cent terminal bonus, the total payout is Rs 1,23,000 or Rs 1,76,000, depending on the bonus rate.        
	Moreover, after deducting the expenses, cost of capital and cost of insurance, companies are not able to announce bonuses more than 4 to 4.5 per cent. Given this, the annual compounded return from investments in a money-back plan for a period of 20 years will vary between a paltry 1.5 per cent and 2.5 per cent.         
	Alternative routes        
	Now consider this. If you are 30 years of age, you can buy a term assurance policy of Rs 10 lakh for a policy term of 20 years at an annual premium of around Rs 3,500. You can thus double your insurance cover by buying a term assurance plan instead of a Rs 5-lakh money-back plan with an annual premium of Rs 3,500. You can invest another Rs 25,000 every year in a PPF account. Your total outgo will be Rs 28,500 a year, much less than the average annual premium one has to shell out for a money-back plan.         
	Though you may not get any lump sum money from the insurance policy during the policy term, the PPF account shall yield Rs 12,35,573 after 20 years. This is higher than what you could get from a money-back policy. The maturity amount of a PPF account is tax free.        
	A systematic monthly investment of Rs 2,000 in an equity mutual fund for 20 years will also earn you much more.         
	At a 10 per cent compounded annual return, your annual investment of Rs 25,000 will amount to more than Rs 15,75,000.         
	Moreover, withdrawals of equity investments after one year are also tax free under the current provisions of the income tax act.

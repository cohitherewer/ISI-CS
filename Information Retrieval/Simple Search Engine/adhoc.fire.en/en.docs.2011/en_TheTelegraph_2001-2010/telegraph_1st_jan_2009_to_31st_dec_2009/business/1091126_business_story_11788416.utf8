The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Lyondell to open China door for RIL 
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Lyondell to open China door for RIL 
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                            
	Mumbai, Nov. 25: Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL)  Indias largest private sector company  can get a beachhead in China if it is able to seal the deal for the $50.7-billion Rotterdam-based distressed petrochemicals major LyondellBasell.        
	RILs acquisition of LyondellBasell will give the $28.8-billion oil-to-petrochemicals giant a stake in a joint venture in which the $212-billion China Petroleum amp; Chemical Corporation (Sinopec Corp) has a 75 per cent holding.        
	Sinopec, the largest producer and distributor of chemical products in China as well as the countrys largest oil refiner, had formed a joint venture two years ago with LyondellBasell for the construction of a world-class propylene oxide-styrene monomer (PO-SM) facility in Ningbo, China.        
	LyondellBasell has a 25 per cent stake in this joint venture with Sinopec, which has established the facility at Ningbo, a flourishing port city that is a two-hour drive from Shanghai via a 33-km sea bridge across the Hangzhou Bay.        
	Reliance confirmed that LyondellBasell was a big player in the propylene business and has a joint venture with Sinopec for this chemical.         
	Despite repeated attempts, the LyondellBasell spokesperson could not be reached for comment. In a presentation by the companys management in late 2008, LyondellBasell had listed its joint venture with Sinopec as one of the key joint ventures that the Dutch company was looking at to drive growth.        
	According to reports, this joint venture will have an annual propylene oxide production capacity of 604 million lbs a year and an annual styrene monomer production capacity of 1.3 billion lbs a year. The joint venture was expected to go on stream in 2009.         
	LyondellBasell is the worlds leading producer of propylene oxide and the venture will allow the Dutch company to use its technological expertise in making this commodity chemical.         
	Propylene oxide is a key intermediary that goes into the manufacture of polyurethane foam used in refrigerators and furniture, and glycols that are used as solvents in cosmetics, pharmaceuticals and food products. It also has its uses in end-products designed for the automotive and the construction industry.        
	Sinopec bid        
	On Wednesday, there were unconfirmed reports that Sinopec and private equity player TPG Capital had put in a joint bid for bankrupt LyondellBasell. If this is true, analysts said, the acquisition costs for RIL could go up dramatically.        
	Until now, the enterprise value of LyondellBasell  which approached US courts for bankruptcy protection at the start of the year  has been pegged at $11-12 billion.        
	LyondellBasell is expected to emerge from bankruptcy protection in the middle of next month if it is able to work out a deal with its creditors whom it owes close to $23 billion.        
	Oil shares gained on the Hang Seng Index on news that Sinopec was mulling a competing bid for the Dutch company, said reports.         
	A Sinopec spokesperson, however, reportedly denied that the Chinese major had decided to put in a bid for LyondellBasell. Agencies quoted sources as saying that Sinopec had not put in a formal bid and neither had TPG Capital.         
	Analysts see RILs move to bid for LyondellBasell as a means to acquiring manufacturing capacities in the US on the cheap as costs of putting up a refinery from scratch will be colossal.         
	If the deal fructifies, it will also widen the market base for Indias largest private sector company and allow it to cross-sell products in 19 countries.

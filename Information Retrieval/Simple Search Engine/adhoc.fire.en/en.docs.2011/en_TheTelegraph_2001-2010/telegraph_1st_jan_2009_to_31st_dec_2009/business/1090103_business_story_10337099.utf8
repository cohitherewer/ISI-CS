The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Pepsi gets freedom from stake sale
                                                                                                               Pepsi gets freedom from stake sale
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                          NO MORE HURDLES                                  
	New Delhi, Jan. 2: PepsiCo need not divest 49 per cent stake in its Indian arms.        
	The cabinet committee on economic affairs today acceded to the US companys request for a waiver from a sell-off.         
	An exemption was sought on the grounds of changes in the governments foreign investment policy since the time Pepsi was required to sell its stake. Foreign entities are now allowed to hold a 100 per cent stake in a food processing company.        
	Even in October last year, the Foreign Investment Promotion Board (FIPB) had refused to let Pepsi bring in $50 million because it had not fulfilled the sell-off criterion.        
	With the scrapping of the obligation, Pepsi can bring the money.         
	The government has relaxed the investment conditions for the company in India. PepsiCo can now bring $50 million into the country, science and technology minister Kapil Sibal said after the cabinet meeting.        
	The FIPB had made it mandatory for Coca-Cola and Pepsi to reduce their stakes in their Indian units to 51 per cent in five years.         
	However, the policy was modified, with foreign food processing entities allowed to bring 100 per cent investment through the automatic route.         
	Last year, Pepsi had sought the waiver. PepsiCo India has a 100 per cent stake in Aradhana Soft Drinks Company, and the deadline for divesting 49 per cent equity expired in December 2007.         
	Paradip project         
	The cabinet has approved the construction of iron ore and coal berths at the Paradip port on a build-operate-transfer basis at an estimated cost of Rs 1,070 crore.        
	This will help to minimise congestion and reduce freight cost, Sibal said.         
	The coal berth will cost Rs 479.10 crore and the iron ore one, Rs 591.35 crore.        
	In uranium, the cabinet agreed to revise the royalty rates to be paid to states.        
	They will now get royalty on uranium mining on an ad valorem basis, equivalent to two per cent of compensation received by the Uranium Corporation of India Ltd.         
	It was also decided at the cabinet meeting to set up a grape processing board at an investment of Rs 5.93 crore to promote Indian wine.        
	The autonomous body will do research and development and initiate other activities.

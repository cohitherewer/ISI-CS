The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Trade tweak to be minimum
                                                                                                               Trade tweak to be minimum
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Dim hope                                  
	New Delhi, Feb. 23: Exporters can expect little from the foreign trade policy to be announced later this week. The policy is being announced a month ahead of schedule because of the forthcoming Lok Sabha polls.        
	Commerce ministry officials said the trade policy was likely to be announced on February 26 or 27.        
	Sources said the government would extend the policy till December and provide some simplification in procedures but might not usher in major policy changes.        
	Exporters may be given more time to meet their export obligations against duty-free imports of machinery and raw materials. The government may also allow the revalidation of expired licences for duty-free imports and reduce the average export obligation.        
	As payments are getting delayed because of the credit crunch, the policy can also separate the grant of benefit under the duty entitlement pass book (DEPB) scheme  a duty reimbursement scheme for exporters  from the realisation of export proceeds.         
	The foreign trade policy, unveiled by the UPA government in September 2004, is scheduled to expire on March 31, 2009.         
	Because of the elections the government will not be announcing any new policy and the current one will continue, trade analysts said.        
	Officials said the model code of conduct would come into force once the elections are announced and the Election Commission was expected to announce the Lok Sabha poll dates in the first week of March.        
	The five-year foreign trade policy lays the ground rules along with incentives and disincentives for conducting imports and exports.         
	The new trade policy for 2010-14 is likely to be announced in June, which will enable the new government to formulate its own rules for the countrys external engagement.        
	After registering a handsome growth rate of over 30 per cent in the first half of the current fiscal, Indias exports turned negative in October and is unlikely to meet the annual target of $200 billion.

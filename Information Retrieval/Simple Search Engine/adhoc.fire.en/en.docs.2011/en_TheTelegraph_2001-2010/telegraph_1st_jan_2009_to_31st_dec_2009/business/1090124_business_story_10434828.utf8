The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | L amp;T ups Satyam stake to 12%   Company move adds new twist to tech tale
                                                                                                               L amp;T ups Satyam stake to 12%     -  Company move adds new twist to tech tale
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                  
	Mumbai, Jan. 23: Larsen amp; Toubro today raised its stake in Satyam Computer Services to 12 per cent from 4 per cent, fuelling speculation that the engineering and construction giant might be keen to play a crucial role in the unfolding drama.        
	The latest round of share purchase makes L amp;T the single largest shareholder in Satyam.        
	Industry sees two reasons behind this move: L amp;T is keen to strike a strategic alliance with the scam-tainted software firm as it already has a presence in the IT sector through Larsen amp; Toubro Infotech. Second, the company is trying to bring down the acquisition cost of the 4 per cent stake it had earlier bought in Satyam for an average price of Rs 150 per share.         
	Commenting on the decision, a company spokesperson said, These market purchases will ensure that we have a large enough stake to protect our investment. With a 4 per cent shareholding we would not have much of a say in what is being done to the company.         
	The company may also be keen to secure a board seat and an increased shareholding could ensure that. The spokesperson, however, refused to comment on this. This purchase will reduce the average cost of purchase in Satyam for L amp;T, he added.         
	In a series of bulk deals on Friday, L amp;T picked up 390,30,954 shares at Rs 34.52 per share on the National Stock Exchange and 118,89,010 shares at Rs 35.07 per share on the Bombay Stock Exchange.         
	It is still not clear if L amp;T is interested in buying more to raise its shareholding in Satyam to 15 per cent, after which an open offer will be triggered off.         
	Unconfirmed reports suggest that L amp;T will seek indemnities against liabilities arising from third party claims from the government before it decides to increase its stake in Satyam any further. The L amp;T spokesperson declined to comment on these possible developments.         
	Earlier this month, L amp;T chairman A.M. Naik had told The Telegraph that he was keen to support Satyam in these troubled times. He hoped that Satyam would make a comeback and its share price would go up. Naik saw little point in cashing out of Satyam at huge mark-to-market losses.         
	The L amp;T scrip fell 3.5 per cent to Rs 640.85 per share on the BSE today, while the Satyam stock made a smart recovery, closing at Rs 38.85  an increase of 31.25 per cent over the previous close of Rs 29.60.

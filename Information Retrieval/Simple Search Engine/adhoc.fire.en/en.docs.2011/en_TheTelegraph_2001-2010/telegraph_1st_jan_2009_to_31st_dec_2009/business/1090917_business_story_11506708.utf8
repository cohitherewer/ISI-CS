                                                                                                               Datacom, Aircel in tower pact     Deal to hasten service rollout
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                          SHARE STRATEGY                                        
	New Delhi, Sept. 16: Datacom Solutions  a new entrant to Indias lucrative telecom space  has awarded a Rs 2,000-crore tower-sharing contract to Aircel Cellular.         
	Under the agreement, spread over a 16-month period, Datacom will get access to 5,000 of Aircels towers across various circles.        
	The deal will help Datacom, which has got a telecom licence but is yet to start operations, to roll out services across the country faster.         
	Aircel, on the other hand, gets a new tenant for its towers, adding to its income and lowering cost and increasing valuations of the tower assets.        
	We have entered into a passive infrastructure sharing agreement with Aircel, and the deal is for around 5,000 towers, Venugopal Dhoot, chairman of the Videocon group, which jointly owns Datacom Solutions, told The Telegraph.        
	This is a landmark deal and a unique opportunity for Datacom Solutions as this will enable a faster rollout of services across all the 22 circles in the country, he said.        
	However, the Aircel spokesperson did not confirm the development.        
	The company (Datacom) aims to start mobile services by the end of this year, Dhoot said.        
	Datacom is a joint venture between the Videocon group and industrialist Mahendra Nahata of Himachal Futuristic Communications Ltd.        
	Aircel, in which Malaysias Maxis Communications Berhad owns a 74 per cent stake, has over 15,000 towers across 17 circles in the country. It has licences to operate in all the 22 circles.        
	For some time now, Aircel has been trying to offload stake in its tower operations. It has been in talks with firms such as Wireless Tata Telecom Infrastructure Ltd and GTL Infrastructure Ltd.        
	The Datacom-Aircel agreement marks another major tower-sharing deal by new telecom players.         
	Earlier, Etisalat DB, which has acquired a 45 per cent stake in new telecom player, Swan Telecom, had signed a 10-year tower sharing deal with the hived-off infrastructure arm of Reliance Communications.        
	Norways Telenor, which has a stake in Unitech Wireless, had signed an infrastructure-sharing deal with Tata-Quippo this year.         
	New telecom companies starting operations in India, the worlds fastest-growing mobile phone market, are looking to save on costs by sourcing infrastructure, including mobile masts from existing telecom firms and independent tower companies.

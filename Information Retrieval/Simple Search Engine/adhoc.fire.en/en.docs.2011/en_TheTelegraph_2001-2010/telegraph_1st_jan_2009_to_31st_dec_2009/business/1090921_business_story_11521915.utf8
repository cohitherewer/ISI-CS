The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Chinese firms target branded mobile market
                                                                                                               Chinese firms target branded mobile market
          JAYATI GHOSE                          Long-distance CALL                                  
	New Delhi, Sept. 20: Branded Chinese handset makers are eyeing the Rs 26,000-crore Indian mobile phone market at a time the Centre is cracking down on unbranded phones from that country.        
	ZTE, Chinas second-largest telecom equipment maker, and Yulong, the countrys largest dual mode handset manufacturer, are venturing into India in a market dominated by Finland-based Nokia. Dual mode phones pack two SIM cards in them, one GSM and the other CDMA.        
	Bird International and Kejian are the other Chinese brands available in the country. Chinese handsets are popular among price-conscious Indian consumers as they have high-end features in mid-to-low-priced models.         
	However, the absence of unique identification numbers in unbranded handsets makes them untraceable and poses security concerns.         
	There are around 25 million non-branded handsets in India, which have been bought from the grey market. Most of them are of Chinese origin.         
	 The Indian telecom market  which adds 1 crore subscribers each month  provides huge potential for Chinese handset manufacturers.         
	Moreover, mobile penetration in China has crossed 50 per cent of the population compared with around 30 per cent in India, meaning the Chinese market can get saturated more quickly.        
	India is a key focus market for us and we are delighted to launch ZTE branded handsets in the retail market as this will play a key role in furthering our existing market share in the country, said D.K. Ghosh, chairman and managing director of ZTE India.        
	ZTE has sold over 25 million handsets in India through service providers such as Reliance Communications, BSNL, Tata Teleservices and Vodafone. Its latest handsets would be available under the ZTE brand.        
	Another prospective entrant is Yulong  a subsidiary of Hong Kong-listed China Wireless Technologies  which is in talks with Reliance ADA Group for an exclusive distribution tie-up.         
	We are currently exploring business opportunity with Yulong to retail the companys dual-mode handsets in India and are in advanced stages of finalising this alliance, Sarup Chowdhary, CEO of Reliance Webstore, told The Telegraph.         
	The Reliance World outlets are managed by Reliance Webstore Ltd, part of the Reliance ADA group.

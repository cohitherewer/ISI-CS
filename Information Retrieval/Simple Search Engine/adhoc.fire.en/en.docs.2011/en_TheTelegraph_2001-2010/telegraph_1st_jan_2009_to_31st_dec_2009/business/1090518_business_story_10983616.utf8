The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Sterlite fight for Asarco control reaches climax
                                                                                                               Sterlite fight for Asarco control reaches climax
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          At loggerheads                                  
	Calcutta, May 17: Sterlite Industries bid to acquire bankrupt US copper miner Asarco rests with the courts, with rival Grupo Mexico formally submitting its counter offer.        
	The Mexican firm has put in a $1.55bn bid for Arizona-based Asarco compared with Sterlites $1.7bn offer. While Grupos offer is less than Sterlites, the upfront cash component is higher.         
	Grupo said it was offering $1.3 billion in cash and $250 million as a fully committed loan.         
	Sterlites offer is for $1.1 billion in cash and about $600 million in senior secured notes spread over nine years.        
	Grupo made the offer through subsidiary Americas Mining Corporation on the last day of submission, as directed by a bankruptcy court of Texas.        
	The Mexican firm had acquired Asarco in a leveraged buyout in 1999 but lost board control because of the bankruptcy.         
	Both the potential buyers have now filed their reorganisation plans with the bankruptcy court.        
	We look forward to the courts decision in this process and to regain control of our subsidiary, Alberto de la Parra, general counsel of Grupo Mexico, said in a statement.        
	Asarco, which owns three copper mines in Arizona, filed for bankruptcy protection in 2005, after it was sued for more than $1 billion for damages to the environment.        
	Grupo said its proposed reorganisation had the full support of Asarcos asbestos creditors, which the Sterlite plan did not have.         
	However, Sterlite has the support of the trade unions and a section of the US government.         
	Sterlite, a unit of London-listed Vedanta Resources Plc and owned by NRI-billionaire Anil Agarwal, had renegotiated its earlier $2.6bn offer for Asarco.         
	Sterlite had backed out of the deal in October, saying it wanted the acquisition cost to be lowered because of the slump in copper prices globally.        
	Asarco received court approval last month to grant Sterlite certain protections for its $1.7bn offer, including a break-up fee and expense reimbursement if the deal did not go through.         
	Grupo Mexico is now seeking to overturn this ruling.

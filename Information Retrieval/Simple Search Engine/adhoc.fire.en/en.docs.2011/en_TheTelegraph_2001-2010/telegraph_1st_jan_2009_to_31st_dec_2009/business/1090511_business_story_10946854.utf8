          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                               
	New Delhi, May 10: A CII-Ascon survey on manufacturing performance shows some segments reversing a negative trend to post a moderate growth rate in the third and fourth quarters of 2008-09.         
	Fertiliser, steel and two-wheelers demonstrated moderate expansion along with petrochemical products such as low- and high-density polyethylene, and pig iron.         
	Fall in the external demand and the presence of strong cyclical movements, which are moving downwards, could have pulled down the industrial growth rate. But, there are signs of a recovery. This shows that the downward cycle is bottoming out, said N. R. Bhanumurthy of the Institute of Economic Growth.         
	In February, industrial production contracted 1.2 per cent compared with 9.5 per cent a year ago. The government will release the industrial production number for March next week. ABN Amro Banks survey along with CIIs have sparked hopes of a recovery in manufacturing on the back of an increased domestic demand.         
	The six core industries grew 2.9 per cent in March 2009, slightly higher than the 2.2 per cent growth in the previous month, but lower than 5.9 per cent in March 2008.         
	ABN Amro Banks purchasing managers index (PMI) show manufacturing touch a high of 53.3 in April from 49.5 in March, the first expansion since October 2008.         
	A reading above 50 indicates expansion. A surge in new orders and domestic demand led to manufacturing growth.         
	The April PMI gives a very clear indication that business conditions in the manufacturing sector have improved significantly after a period of sharp contraction and gradual stabilisation, Gaurav Kapur, senior economist with ABN Amro India, said.

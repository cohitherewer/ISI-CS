          A STAFF REPORTER                      Ramanathan in Calcutta on Friday. A Telegraph picture                          
	Calcutta, July 17: Exide Industries may exit its distribution joint venture in Australia.        
	It may either sell its 26 per cent stake in Australian industrial battery distributor Ceil Motive Power Pty Ltd or restructure the joint venture, a company director said today.        
	Recession has hit the bottomline of the Australian venture, forcing a review of the operations. Exide is also looking for local firms who can manage the company in Australia, the director, who did not want to be named, said. Exide had invested Australian $1 million (Rs 3.5 crore) to pick up the 26 per cent in Ceil Motive.         
	Exide is gearing up to participate in the exhibition of electric cars at the New Delhi Commonwealth Games next year. It has tied up with Chinese firm Thunder Sky last year to import lithium-ion batteries used in electric vehicles.         
	Initially, we will source 10 sets of such batteries. Depending on the market response, we plan to increase this to 1-2 million ampere per year, Exide CEO and managing director T. V. Ramanathan said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Cash prop for textiles in three days
                                                                                                               Cash prop for textiles in three days
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Aug. 6: The government will provide Rs 2,546- crore subsidy to the textile industry, mauled by recession. The fund will reach the beneficiaries in three days.        
	The Technology Upgradation Fund Scheme (TUFS) will reach 12,540 beneficiaries through 121 financial institutions and banks, textiles minister Dayanidhi Maran said.        
	This is the first time that such a large amount of subsidy has been released in a single tranche and the amount will be credited to the bank accounts of the beneficiaries in a record time of 72 hours (three working days), he said.        
	In the budget, the government had allocated Rs 3,140 crore for textile firms under the TUFS. The subsidy will be released from this fund.         
	It is a commitment which the government has met. Earlier, the allocation used to be a quarter of the demand, which made the fund meaningless, D.K. Nair, secretary-general of the Confederation of Indian Textile Industry, said.         
	He said the fund would be useful as the industry had invested about Rs 1.65 lakh crore in the last 8-10 years.         
	The scheme provides for an interest subsidy of 5 per cent, benefiting the firms paying an interest of around 11-13 per cent now, he said. However, there could be a requirement of around Rs 1,000 crore in the next two quarters of this fiscal that might be met through supplementary demand of grants in Parliament.         
	Banks and financial institutions were reportedly going slow on funding textile mills under the TUFS because they were not getting timely reimbursements of the interest subsidy from the government.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Extra cover                                  
	New Delhi, April 23: The government has slapped anti-dumping duties on some stainless steel products imported from the US, China, Japan and other countries after it realised that the items were grossly underpriced.         
	The domestic industry had suffered material injury. The injury had been caused by the dumped imports, said a notification of the Central Board of Excise and Customs.        
	Some of the firms named in the notification include ArcelorMittal  the duty is on the companys products from France and Belgium  Lianzhong and Shanxi Taigang from China, Acrinox  items from Spain and Malaysia  Columbus from South Africa, Posco from South Korea and Yieh United from Taiwan.        
	The anti-dumping duties vary between $12.74 and $2,011 per tonne depending on the type of steel, the country of manufacture, the origin of import and the producer. They are effective till October 21.        
	At present, a tonne of cold-rolled flat stainless steel costs over $19,000 in the global market.        
	N.C. Mathur, president of the Indian Stainless Steel Development Association, said the duty was a clear message to the producers and to the countries that have been sharply undercutting Indian producers.        
	Stainless steel importers such as utensil makers have called the governments move unethical and unjustified and have asked for a rollback.        
	Imposing anti-dumping duty (at the) behest of a single domestic manufacturer is not fair and ethical as it takes away our right to choose our vendor, the All India Stainless Steel Industries Association said in a statement today.

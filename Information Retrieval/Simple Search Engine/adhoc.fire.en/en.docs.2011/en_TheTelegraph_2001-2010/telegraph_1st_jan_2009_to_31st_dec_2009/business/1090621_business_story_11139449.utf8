                                                                                                               June 23 date for Mahindra entity float
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, June 20: Mahindra Holidays and Resorts, a hospitality unit of the Mahindra and Mahindra group, is set to come out with its initial public offering on June 23.         
	Analysts said the stock market was buzz with activity as firms have lined up IPOs to tap around Rs 7,000 crore by the end of this year.        
	Mahindra is the first big company to test the market since the UPA government started its second term and plans to raise around Rs 450 crore. The company has fixed the price band between Rs 275 and Rs 325 per equity share. The public float of 92,65,275 equity shares of Rs 10 each will close on June 26. Ramesh Ramanathan, managing director of Club Mahindra, said, The proceeds from the IPO will be used to add new properties and expand some of its existing resorts.         
	This is the right time for the firms which plan to tap the capital market and a good time for the investor to grab the IPOs, Rajesh Kumar Bajaj, managing director of the Lohia Securities said.        
	Avinash Gupta of Bonanza Portfolio said, There is an investor appetite to grab the IPO, now that the economy has started reviving. But one needs to wait and see how much appetite investors have as the government plans to divest stake in PSUs.        
	The proposed issue by Mahindra Holidays will end a 15-month drought in India as firms stayed away from public offerings in 2008 in the wake of the economic slowdown and a falling market.

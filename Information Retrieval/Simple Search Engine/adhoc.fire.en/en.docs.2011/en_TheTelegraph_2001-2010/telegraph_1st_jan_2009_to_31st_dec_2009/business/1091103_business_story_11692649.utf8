          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Countdown begins                                  
	New Delhi, Nov. 2: The sale of natural gas from the Raniganj coal bed methane block operated by Essar is likely to begin in the last quarter of this fiscal.         
	Gas flow has started and sales are likely to commence from the fourth quarter of 2009-10, Essar said.        
	An international agency, NSAI, has certified the in-place reserves at the block at a level of 3.1 trillion cubic feet (tcf). A third of these reserves is recoverable.        
	Essar Oil managing director Naresh Nayyar said, Essar Oil is fast emerging as a major player in the CBM space in India, with a potential in-place resource of over 8tcf. Going forward there would be a lot more focus on exploration and production.        
	Sources said Essar had invested around Rs 150 crore in the Raniganj block, and the project would see an overall investment of approximately Rs 1,500-1,750 crore. The firm would soon approach banks to raise debts to fund the project.        
	Raniganj is the countrys oldest coal-mining zone, and the gas will cater to the demands in the areas around Durgapur. The projected demand for gas within a 150-km radius of the block is around 18 million metric standard cubic metres a day (mmscmd), which is expected to increase to 50 mmscmd by 2017.        
	The company said the production sharing contract for Nigerian oil and gas block OPL 226 would be signed in December. Essar had bagged the shallow water offshore block, which has reserves in excess of 80 million barrels in May 2007. However, in July 2008, the Nigerian government cancelled the allocation, saying Essar failed to meet the pre- qualification requirement. The block was later given back to Essar.         
	The contract would be signed next month.

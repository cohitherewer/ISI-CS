The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Auto parts rev up to tackle downturn
                                                                                                               Auto parts rev up to tackle downturn
          GARIMA SINGH NEOGY                          ROUGH RIDE                                  
	New Delhi, Feb. 18: Automobile component manufacturers are holding back capacity expansion, reducing working days and diverting capacity to beat the slowdown.         
	Companies have cut down on the number of working hours as working capital has frozen and investments have been delayed. In the last few months, sales have been low and companies have been idling with excess capacity, said Srivats Ram, joint managing director, Wheels India, supplier to a large number of original equipment manufacturers (OEMs).         
	We are now thinking of renting out some of our idle capacity to other industries. We have not finalised anything yet, but are considering this option, he said.        
	Facilities of auto component units can be used by consumer durables firms, which even now are reporting growth rates of 15-20 per cent.         
	A steep fall in the demand for commercial vehicles in the last quarter has dealt a blow.         
	According to data compiled by the Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers (Siam), commercial vehicles segment have recorded a dip of 58.28 per cent at 17,920 units in December 2008 against 42,961 a year ago.        
	Siam said it was the segments worst performance in the last 11 years. In July 1997, the segment had witnessed a decline of 51.76 per cent in sales, said Sugato Sen, senior director, Siam.        
	The impact has been felt more by companies who are heavily dependent on commercial vehicles. These are mainly smaller component makers serving single customers. They have laid off mostly temporary and casual workers, said Vishnu Mathur, executive director, Automotive Component Manufacturers Association of India.        
	Subros, which makes ACs for cars has been hit by the slowdown but expects the market to improve in the next two to three months.         
	Seeing the market conditions, we, too, made some adjustments with our temporary and casual workers, but there have been no retrenchment of permanent workers, said Ramesh Suri, chairman and managing director, Subros.        
	Automotive Axles Ltd has informed the BSE about withdrawing all capacity expansion proposals. Kesoram Industries had stalled operations at its Balasore unit in January and hinted at steep production cuts in the coming months.        
	A study by Ficci said the government should set up funds for industrial adjustment and technology acquisition.

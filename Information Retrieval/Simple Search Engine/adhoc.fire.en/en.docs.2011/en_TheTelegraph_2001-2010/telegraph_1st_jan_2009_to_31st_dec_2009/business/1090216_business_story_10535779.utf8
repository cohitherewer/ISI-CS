The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Avoid clubbing
                                                                                                                 Q amp;A      Avoid clubbing
                                I hold a PAN card. I have an income from a house property that I inherited from my father. However, my total annual income is below the taxable limit. Now, my husband has gifted me some money. I had kept this money in a bank fixed deposit. Will the interest on the fixed deposit be treated as my income? If I acknowledge in writing the money as interest-free loan from my husband, do I have to pay income tax on the interest income?          Krishna Ghosh, Calcutta
                    terest-free loan or a gift from your husband will not make much of a difference in your income tax liability. Even if your husband lends you the money at a minimal interest, he will have to pay income tax on the interest from the loan given to you and you will have to pay income tax on the interest from the fixed deposit, if your total income, including the interest on the fixed deposit, becomes taxable. However, you can deduct the interest given to your husband from the interest you earn on the fixed deposit. Any income on gifts to spouse is clubbed in the hands of the donor. Clubbing of income could have been avoided had you invested the gifted amount in equity shares, mutual funds or PPF as the income on these instruments are tax-exempt.                                    Gift from son      I am a central government pensioner. Accounting for all deductions under the provisions of the Income Tax Act, my residual income is just below the threshold. I have received Rs 60,000 as gift from my son. Is this amount taxable at my hand? Is it necessary for me to have a PAN? My gross annual income from pension and other sources is around Rs 3.5 lakh. What is the maximum amount I can donate under Section 80G?        M.L. Dutta, Ballygunge
                    Gifts received from close relatives are tax-free. However, any income from the gifted amount is taxable in the hands of the donee. So, while you dont have to pay any income tax on receiving the gift, youll have to pay tax on the income arising out of investment of the gifted amount (except for in tax-free instruments). Taxpayer or not, any one can have a PAN and PAN is being made a compulsory document for other purposes, too. You can donate any amount under Section 80G, but how much tax relief you can claim from this donated amount depends on where you have donated the amount.

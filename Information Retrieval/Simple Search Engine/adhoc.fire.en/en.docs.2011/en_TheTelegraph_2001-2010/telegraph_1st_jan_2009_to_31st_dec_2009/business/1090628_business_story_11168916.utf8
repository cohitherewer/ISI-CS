	The company had not abandoned its idea of inducting a strategic investor, though it was not discussed in todays board meeting.

	The New Delhi-based companys shares closed on Friday at Rs 55.55, up Rs 3.35, or 6.42 per cent, on the Bombay Stock Exchange.         
	The Life Insurance Corporation is the single-largest shareholder of IFCI with an 8.4 per cent stake, followed by IDBI Bank at 5 per cent.         
	A large chunk of 26 per cent is held by the public, another 21.8 per cent is with foreign institutional investors, and 13.6 per cent is held by private corporate entities.         
	IFCI is registered with the Reserve Bank of India as a non-deposit taking NBFC.

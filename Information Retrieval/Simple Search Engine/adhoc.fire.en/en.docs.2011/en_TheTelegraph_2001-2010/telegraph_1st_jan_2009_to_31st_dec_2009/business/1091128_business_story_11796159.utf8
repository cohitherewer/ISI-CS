          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Anand Sharma in New Delhi on Friday. (PTI)                                  
	New Delhi, Nov. 27: Exports fell 6.6 per cent in October, a far cry from the recession-high decline of 39.2 per cent in May and indicated a recovery in merchandise demand in the major world markets.        
	October exports dropped to $13.19 billion from $14.13 billion a year ago.         
	We have succeeded through incentives to arrest the steep decline. The government, which is monitoring the developments, will intervene, if required, commerce minister Anand Sharma said.        
	The government could come up with more sops in engineering, electronics, jute, carpets and handicrafts.         
	Sharma said his ministry would complete its sectoral analysis in the next few weeks, from which the segments that needed help would be identified.        
	However, he did not elaborate whether there would be another fiscal stimulus for the chosen segments.        
	Since October last year, the government has taken a number of steps such as providing an interest subsidy, helping with market diversification and restoring tax refunds.        
	Sharma is confident of the export trend turning positive from December.         
	He said exports should expand from the next fiscal and the following fiscal will see a growth rate of 25 per cent.        
	Data show exports of handicrafts, basic chemicals, leather, gems and jewellery, electronics and engineering goods fell, though the rate of decline was slower.         
	Jute, carpets, coal and other ores, including processed minerals, continued to suffer.        
	Man-made yarn and fabric grew 1.2 per cent, tobacco was up 20.5 per cent and fruits and vegetables, 5.7 per cent.         
	Exports of plastic, pharmaceuticals, marine products, spices, iron ore, cashew and petroleum products also turned around.        
	The stabilisation in the exports needs to be viewed in the context of projections of the IMF of a 11.9 per cent decline in world trade volume during the year, Sharma said.

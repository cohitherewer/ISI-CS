          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Calcutta, Sept. 29: Global IT solutions company MindTree will acquire Kyocera Wireless India Pvt Ltd, the Indian subsidiary of San-Diego-based Kyocera Wireless Corp, for an initial cash payment of about $6 million. Further payments would be linked to the revenues of Kyocera Wireless India in 2010-11 and 2011-2012.        
	MindTree told the stock exchanges that it expected the acquisition to contribute about $9 million to its revenues for the period, October 2009 to March 2010.         
	This acquisition makes them (Kyocera) a major strategic client for MindTree, said Janakiraman S, president and group chief executive (product engineering services) of MindTree.        
	Kyocera Wireless India, which employs about 600 people, will continue to provide product-development, testing and software-engineering services to its current parent and other Kyocera entities on a contract basis, the statement said. The deal will help fuel growth of MindTrees product engineering services business under which it offers design and technology services including wireless technology, MindTree CEO and managing director Krishnakumar Natarajan said.         
	This allows Kyocera to improve its cost structure and competitiveness, while providing MindTree a strong engineering resource, especially in the field of software for mobile devices, Kyocera Corp general manager Yasuyuki Yamamoto said.        
	In July, MindTree said its consolidated earnings would be $30.4-$36.8 million for 2009-10 on revenue of $255-$270 million. The company had earlier projected its consolidated earnings to be between $37.7 and $39 million on revenues of $290-$300 million. The firm had lowered its projections on the back of global recession.

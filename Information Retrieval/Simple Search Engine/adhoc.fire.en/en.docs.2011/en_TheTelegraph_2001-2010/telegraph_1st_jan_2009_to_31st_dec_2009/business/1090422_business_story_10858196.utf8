The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Policy change to help small savers
                                                                                                               Policy change to help small savers
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Reserve Bank governor D. Subbarao (centre) with deputy governors Rakesh Mohan and Usha Thorat in Mumbai on Tuesday. (Reuters)                                   
	Mumbai, April 21: The annual policy statement released by the Reserve Bank of India had something for the small saver as well, particularly the tardy and imprudent investors who tend to park their cash in savings bank accounts that offer a piffling 3.5 per cent interest.        
	In what will improve their yield or returns, the RBI changed the method of calculating interest on these accounts with effect from April 1 next year.        
	At present, interest on savings bank accounts is calculated on the minimum balances held in the accounts of an individual from the tenth day to the last day of each calendar month. From next year, this will be done on a daily basis.        
	According to the RBI, several banks had suggested that interest on savings bank accounts might be calculated either on the minimum balances in the deposit accounts from the first to the last day of each calendar month or on a daily basis.        
	The matter was referred to the Indian Banks Association, which felt that payment of interest on a daily basis would be feasible only when computerisation in banks was completed.        
	In view of the present satisfactory level of computerisation in commercial bank branches, it is proposed that payment of interest on savings bank accounts by scheduled commercial banks would be calculated on a daily product basis with effect from April 1, 2010, the RBI said today.        
	K.V.S Manian, group head (retail liabilities amp; branch banking) at Kotak Mahindra Bank, said the change would prove to be a gain for the savings account holder. This is far more transparent and a customer-friendly measure. It will improve the yield for many depositors though it will also result in an increase in cost for banks, he said.        
	Banks have also been allowed to open off-site ATMs without seeking the central banks permission.

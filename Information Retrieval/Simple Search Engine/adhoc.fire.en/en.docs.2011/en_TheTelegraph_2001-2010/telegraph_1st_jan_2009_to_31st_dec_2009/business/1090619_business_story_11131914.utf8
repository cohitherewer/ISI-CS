The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Wholesale price index falls after 30 years
                                                                                                               Wholesale price index falls after 30 years
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                            
	New Delhi, June 18: The countrys wholesale price index fell for the first time in three decades today, but government officials and analysts described this as a statistical blip and allayed fears of real deflation.        
	Though food prices continued to rule high, the rate of inflation slipped into the negative zone (-1.61 per cent) for the week ended June 6 after gaining 0.13 per cent in the previous week mainly because of a high base last year (when goods were dearer because of steep global crude prices).         
	The Reserve Bank of India and analysts had forecast negative trends in the price index mainly for statistical reasons, rather than calling it deflation that follows a sharp contraction in demand.        
	In fact, the countrys factory output had recorded a rise in April, signalling a pick-up in demand.        
	Industry wanted immediate action like cuts in interest rates to boost demand even as bankers opined that interest rates could be cut by up to one percentage point.        
	After the inflation data were released, the stock market rose 200 points but closed the day lower by 257 points at 14265.        
	The government needs to intervene to rationalise the negative inflation as it reflects slowdown in production activities with the piling up of inventories due to lack of demand, industry chamber Assocham said.        
	For the week ended June 6 this year, the wholesale price index shrank to 232.7 points from 236.5 in the year-ago week.        
	However, the dip in the price index meant little for the common man, as pulses were dearer by 17 per cent, cereals 13.5 per cent, and fruit and vegetables 10 per cent from the level a year ago.        
	The fuel index, however, slipped 13 per cent compared with the year-ago period as international crude prices have softened.         
	However, furnace oil and naphtha turned expensive by 7 per cent each and diesel oil was dearer by 4 per cent.        
	This (negative inflation) is not a matter of crisis. Rather this is course correction or normalisation. There is nothing to worry as this is happening because of the base effect, Planning Commission member Saumitra Chaudhuri said.         
	Our assessment is that wholesale price index (WPI) is likely to be in the negative region for sometime to come. This is something (that does) not really lead us to any major policy shift, finance secretary Ashok Chawla said.        
	Inflation falling below zero was imminent. It merely got delayed due to rising food prices. Negative inflation is due to low demand and high base effect, D. K. Joshi, principal economist with rating agency Crisil, said.        
	We will have negative numbers at least till September, primarily because inflation had picked up very sharply during this period last year, Sonal Verma, an economist at Nomura, said.        
	Inflation hit a 13-year high of 12.9 per cent in August last year, but had been coming down since then.

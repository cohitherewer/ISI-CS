The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Pranab roots for farm credit
                                                                                                               Pranab roots for farm credit
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                          Finance minister Pranab Mukherjee with ministry officials and PSU bank executives in New Delhi on Wednesday. (PTI)                                  
	New Delhi, Oct. 28: The Centre today asked public sector banks to give more loans to farmers and small businesses, which would help to create jobs and boost demand.        
	Taking advantage of the upcoming busy season, banks should enhance credit flow to the employment generating sectors, especially agriculture and the micro and small enterprises, finance minister Pranab Mukherjee said at a meeting with some PSU bank chiefs.        
	Appreciating the role of PSU banks in meeting the credit needs of the economy during recession, Mukherjee said: Public sector banks have been the leaders in taking forward the governments goal of targeted lending to achieve inclusive growth.        
	However, to meet the farm credit target for this fiscal, banks need to shovel more loans into agriculture in the third and the fourth quarters.        
	In micro and small enterprises, Mukherjee said, the target is 20 per cent growth this fiscal, whereas it has been 13 per cent in the first half.        
	The finance minister said he was confident about banks meeting the target for the minority communities, which is 15 per cent of priority sector lending.         
	He urged banks to rapidly scale up their efforts to offer services in the inaccessible regions through the application of technology and use of alternative distribution channels.        
	RBI policy        
	Finance secretary Ashok Chawla today said the RBI might take in January more measures similar to Tuesdays statutory-liquidity-ratio hike to exit from its accommodative monetary stance.         
	Whatever you will see it will be in January, that is my assessment.         
	He said the governments market borrowings would not exceed the budget target of Rs 5.5 lakh crore as the amount was sufficient to meet the needs of the Centre and states.        
	The Centres borrowings would be Rs 4.5 lakh crore, while the states would mop up Rs one lakh crore between November and March.        
	To overcome the economic slowdown, the Centre had allowed states greater freedom to borrow from the market, even if it meant that fiscal deficit would stretch to 4 per cent of their gross domestic product from the earlier level of 3 per cent.

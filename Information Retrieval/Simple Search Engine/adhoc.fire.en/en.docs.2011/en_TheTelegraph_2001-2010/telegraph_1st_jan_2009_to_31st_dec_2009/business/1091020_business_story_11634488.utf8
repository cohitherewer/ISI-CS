	Calcutta, Oct. 19: Credit cards have lost their sheen, thanks to the economic slowdown and tighter norms of card issuers.         
	The number of active credit cards in the country in August has declined to nearly 219.49 lakh from 243.67 lakh in April.         
	The number of cards stood at 261.53 lakh in December last year.        
	Experts blame the decline on the slowdown, loss of jobs and salary cuts.         
	A senior official of the India Cards Council, a body of all MasterCard issuing banks, said, Beginning this year, we saw that a large number of companies, particularly in the information technology sector, trimming their workforce and wage bill.         
	While those people who were thrown out of jobs, or got less pay, slashed their credit card spending, the cost-cutting measures of corporations had a demonstration effect on the rest of the economy. People got scared and altered their spending habit, the official said.        
	To add to the users woes, banks are planning to recover the dues of defaulters from their salaries.        
	For the April-August period, the decline in credit cards on a year-on-year basis is 17.89 per cent at 219.49 cards against 267.33 lakh at the end of August last year.        
	Credit cards touched a high of 283.12 lakh in April last year and since then, they have been on a decline.         
	Monthly spending through cards is also coming down. In August, total spending through credit cards was Rs 4,858.34 crore compared with Rs 5,801.48 crore in the same month last year, a decline of 16.25 per cent.        
	Total spending during the current financial year till August was 12.24 per cent lower than last year.        
	In May 2008, card issuers had hiked interest rates to 3.40 per cent a month, slashed credit and cash withdrawal limits and introduced annual fees to reduce the number of new cards and check payment default.         
	Defaults rose sharply to over 15 per cent last year from around 5 per cent in the previous years, said an official of a private sector bank.

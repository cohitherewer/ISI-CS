          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                             
	Mumbai, Oct. 12: The truce offer by Anil Ambani to brother Mukesh today led to the stocks of their group companies surging on the bourses, with investors hoping that their feud would come to an end.         
	Nearly all Reliance stocks of both the Mukesh and Anil groups gained. However, the sole exception was Anils Reliance Communications which ended in the negative following reports of errors in its accounts.        
	Anil Ambani had said on Sunday that the brothers could sort out all their disagreements in a constructive, cordial and conciliatory manner even at this late stage if both were committed to do so.         
	The issues are only a handful and the facts are well known. My judgement says that they can all be resolved in a matter of weeks, and will not require several months of discussions, he said.         
	Mukeshs Reliance Industries had welcomed Anils offer but said the conduct of the Anil Ambani group made it difficult for RIL to believe that Anil has had a change of heart.         
	Observers are of the opinion that a rapprochement between the two brothers at this stage is unlikely, but there is optimism on the bourses. The expectation is that something will happen, though it seems difficult, a broker said.         
	Reliance Industries surged 3.20 per cent to end at Rs 2,167.10. RIL had only recently declared a bonus issue in the ratio of 1:1. Share prices of the oil giant had softened after the bonus announcement. Mukeshs Reliance Industrial Infrastructure (RIIL) was up 3.48 per cent at Rs 1,045.80 on the BSE.        
	Among Anil Ambani group companies, RNRL surged 5.30 per cent to Rs 87.40. Reliance Capital gained 4.7 per cent to Rs 950.60, Reliance Infrastructure nearly 5 per cent to Rs 1,357 and Reliance Power by 2.6 per cent to Rs 164.20.         
	Market circles said the good show by the shares of the Ambani companies had a positive effect on the sensex.         
	The benchmark index soared 384.01 points, or 2.31 per cent, to 17026.67.

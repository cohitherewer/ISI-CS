	Calcutta, Feb. 14 : The Indian Jute Mills Association has appointed Ernst amp; Young to study the industry and help work out a long-term strategy for the golden fibre.        
	The jute industry is plagued by several problems. While prices of raw jute have surged  from Rs 1,500 per quintal in July to Rs 2,000 now  an 18-day strike in December has affected the captive market of foodgrain and sugar packaging.         
	We decided to get a reputed agency to do the study so that the stakeholders, including the government, could chalk out a long-term strategy for the industry, said Ijma chairman Sanjay Kajaria.        
	E amp;Y director Ram Agarwal said work on the project had already started.         
	This is the first time such a study in being conducted for the jute sector and we have put in experts in the industry to complete the job within time, he said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Slowdown hurts JSW margin
                                                                                                               Slowdown hurts JSW margin
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Mumbai, July 20: JSW Steel Ltd today reported a decline in consolidated net profit for the first quarter ended June 30 because of losses suffered at its US operations.        
	The Sajjan Jindal-led company had a consolidated net profit of Rs 234.08 crore in the first quarter of this fiscal compared with Rs 250.23 crore in the year-ago period. Consolidated net sales dropped to Rs 3,990.19 crore from Rs 4,456.15 crore in the same period last year. JSW Steel said the consolidated numbers were marred by demand contraction and low capacity utilisation at the US mills.        
	On a standalone basis, however, profits rose to Rs 340.02 crore in the first quarter from Rs 219.35 crore, a growth of 55 per cent. Net sales grew to Rs 3,893.87 crore from Rs 3,671.49 crore, though turnover from exports fell.        
	According to JSW Steel, the company has taken several steps to improve volumes and profitability in the first quarter. Cost-cutting measures such as lowering fuel consumption and reducing procurement costs of inputs also helped.        
	Sajjan Jindal, vice-chairman and managing director of JSW Steel, said the company was planning to raise its capacity to 11 million tonnes from 7.8 million tonnes by March 2011. Jindal indicated that earnings before interests and taxes could rise because of lower input costs.

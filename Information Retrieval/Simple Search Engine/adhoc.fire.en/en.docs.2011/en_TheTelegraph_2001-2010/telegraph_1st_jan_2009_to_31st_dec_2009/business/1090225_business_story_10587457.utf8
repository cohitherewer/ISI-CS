	Calcutta, Feb. 24: Amway India has scaled down its growth projections for 2009 to 25 per cent compared with 40 per cent reported in 2008.        
	Last year was an exception. The current years targeted growth rate is an optimistic figure in the FMCG segment given the general slowdown in the economy, Amway Indias managing director and CEO William S. Pinckney said here today. In 2008, the company had registered a turnover of Rs 1,128 crore.        
	Asia has been leading most of the FMCG growth compared to the rest of the world for the last four to five years. India will register the sharpest growth in percentage terms compared to other economies, Pinckney said.         
	Amway has targeted to scale up Indias ranking to among the top two or three markets from seventh, he said on the sidelines of the inauguration of a brand assessment centre.         
	Amway is now focussing on improving access and increasing online sales for which the company will revamp its website. Amway India operates in four categories  nutrition, cosmetics, personal care and homecare.         
	It is also planning to launch co-branded debit cards. However, Pinckney refused to give details.        
	He said Amway planned to add about 100,000 direct sellers. People who have lost their jobs owing to the economic slowdown can consider taking up our distributorship. Nearly 60 per cent of the direct sellers stay with the company, he said.        
	Amway would expand the touchpoints to 150 to expand its reach to 3,500-4,000 cities and towns across the country.

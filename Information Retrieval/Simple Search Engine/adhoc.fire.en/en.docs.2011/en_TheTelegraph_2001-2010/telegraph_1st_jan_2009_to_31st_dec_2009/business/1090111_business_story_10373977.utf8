The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Citi, Morgan in deal talks
                                                                                                               Citi, Morgan in deal talks
                              Selloff mode                            
	New York, Jan. 10 (Reuters): Citigroup Inc is in advanced talks to sell its Smith Barney brokerage unit to Morgan Stanley, a person familiar with the matter said on Friday. The selloff would further dismantle the financial supermarket that has been bailed out by the US government.        
	Under the deal being discussed, the two banks would set up a joint venture. Morgan Stanley would control it with a 51 per cent stake and expect to buy Citis 49 per cent share over three to five years, the person said. Talks are serious and advanced but may still fall through. Both banks declined to comment.        
	Separately, former US treasury secretary Robert Rubin has resigned as a senior counsellor to New York-based Citigroup, following months of criticism of his performance, as the banks sinking share price led to a government rescue. The 70-year-old Rubin will remain a director until the banks annual meeting later this year. He joined Citigroup in 1999.        
	A combined brokerage will have more than 23,000 financial advisers before attrition, surpassing rivals Bank of America Corp and Wells Fargo amp; Co.        
	Citigroup ended September with 14,735 brokers, and Morgan Stanley ended November with 8,426. Last week, Bank of America bought Merrill Lynch amp; Co, and Wells Fargo bought Wachovia.        
	Citigroup could boost its capital levels by doing the deal, and Morgan Stanley could diversify its sources of revenue. The US Federal Reserve is pressing the two banks to do a deal because of the potential benefits to both, according to media reports        
	Combining the two businesses could also help Morgan Stanley and Citigroup cut costs. Brokerages are expected to suffer this year as weakness in stock and bond markets globally weigh on trading volume.

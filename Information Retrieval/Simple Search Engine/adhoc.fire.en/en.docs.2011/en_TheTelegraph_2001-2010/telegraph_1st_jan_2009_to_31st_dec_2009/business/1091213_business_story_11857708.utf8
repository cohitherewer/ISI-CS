          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Calcutta, Dec. 12: The Bengal labour department has called another tripartite meeting on Sunday to avert an indefinite strike in the jute industry from Monday.         
	At a meeting today, the third since the trade unions announced the strike on November 26, mill owners insisted that the government should raise the price of jute bags for packing foodgrain so that they could raise wages of workers.         
	Leaders of 20 trade unions remained firm in their demand for payment of statutory dues to over two lakh workers.        
	An indefinite strike will affect the procurement of rabi crops in Punjab, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh. The government has placed orders for 10.5 lakh tonne jute sacks to be supplied between November and April 2010.

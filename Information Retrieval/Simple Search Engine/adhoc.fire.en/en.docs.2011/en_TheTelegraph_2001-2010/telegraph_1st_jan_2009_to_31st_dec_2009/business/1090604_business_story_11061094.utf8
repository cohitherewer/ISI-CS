	Mumbai, June 3: Anand Mahindra has ceased to be a promoter of Kotak Mahindra Bank but will continue to be associated as a non-executive director.        
	The development comes after Anand Mahindra, who is now the vice-chairman and managing director of automobile major Mahindra amp; Mahindra, requested Kotak Mahindra Bank not to classify him as a promoter of the bank.        
	The board met today and approved Mahindras request.         
	Jaimin Bhatt, CFO of Kotak Mahindra Bank, told The Telegraph that while the Mahindras holding in the bank had come down over the past few years to 3.68 per cent from around 15 per cent, they were also not as involved in the operations of the bank as earlier.         
	The bank said all future filings with the stock exchange would classify the holding of Mahindra, his family members and entities controlled by them, as part of the public shareholding.

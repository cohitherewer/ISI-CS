The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | CLB weighs merit of Maytas plea
                                                                                                               CLB weighs merit of Maytas plea
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Feb. 24: The Company Law Board (CLB) is considering a proposal of Maytas Properties to appoint a director on its board or an observer who will report directly to the quasi-judicial body, contrary to the governments demand to sack the whole board and have state nominees.        
	This case is not as it was with Satyam. I would pass a reasonable order, said S. Balasubramanian, chairman of the CLB.         
	The law board today heard the government petition on dissolving the board of Maytas, which is run by B. Rama Raju, the younger son of Satyam founder B. Ramalinga Raju. It will pass an order by Friday.        
	During the proceedings before the CLB today, Maytas advocate Mukul Rohatagi said, The CLB should put an observer on the Maytas board, who would report to you or appoint a director in the company.         
	This was opposed by the government, whose representative argued before the CLB on the need for government nominees.        
	The government said the valuation of Maytas, done by Ernst amp; Young prior to Satyams takeover proposal of the company, was inflated and that there was a clear nexus between the father and son.         
	Ernst amp; Young had valued Maytas Properties at Rs 6,523 crore. How hollow this valuation is. According to our knowledge, Maytas does not have any land bank and this company, having a turnover of a mere Rs 22 crore, was valued at Rs 6,523 crore, the government said.         
	Questioning the governments move to sack the board, Rohatagi said Maytas had no government or PSU projects.        
	However, his arguments got diluted by a filing before the CLB. SRS Orion today submitted before the law board that Maytas had fraudulently transferred Rs 228 crore of its money to another firm.

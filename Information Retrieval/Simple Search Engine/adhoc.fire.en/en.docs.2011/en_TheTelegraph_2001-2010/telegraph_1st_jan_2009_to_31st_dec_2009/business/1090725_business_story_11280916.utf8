	New Delhi, July 24: Software giant Microsoft is keen on being part of the governments unique identification project. Microsoft founder Bill Gates will meet Nandan Nilekani, chairman of the Unique Identification Authority of India, to discuss a possible partnership.        
	Microsoft wants to be part of the Unique Identification Authority of India project, said Gates at a conference organised by the National Association of Software and Services Companies.         
	Gates, who is in Delhi to receive the Indira Gandhi Prize for Peace, Disarmament and Development on behalf of the Gates Foundation, said, It is a great initiative. We need to make sure that every data is accurate.         
	Earlier, a delegation from Israel had expressed interest in bidding for the Rs 10,000-crore ID project.         
	Israeli IT firms with domain expertise in e-governance and homeland security will bid for the unique ID card project jointly with Indian vendors, as local participation is key to such proposals dealing with critical mass, Katrin Melamed, business development manager for the Israeli software industry, had said.        
	Many Israeli firms have developed the technology for e-governance projects, including identity cards with security features such as biometric or fingerprints.        
	Nilekani had earlier said the plan to provide identity numbers for the citizens of India would require global technical expertise and the authority was scouting Indian and foreign shores for appropriate talent.         
	Since providing a unique identification number will require high levels of biometric classification (fingerprints or iris scans), global technical experts will also have to be part of the team, Nilekani had said yesterday while assuming office as head of the Unique Identification Authority of India.        
	Analysts said the project, which has been allocated Rs 120 crore in this years budget, would invite interest from various domestic and foreign software companies, including IBM, Infosys, Mahindra Satyam and the National Securities Depository Ltd (NSDL).         
	NSDL has tied up with Tata Consultancy Services         
	to work on issuing PAN cards and building a centralised pension records system.        
	 Software, hardware and ITeS companies will all benefit from this project, said Som Mittal, president of Nasscom. Mittal said while the project could be around $2 billion, more importantly it paves the way for the other $8 billion or $10 billion - which is the total outlay for e-governance projects - to be spent.        
	The project aims to create unique identification numbers for all Indians by 2011. At present, India does not have any standard identification card or number to authenticate an individuals identity.         
	The online database will be available in the public domain and any individual or organisation can login to verify the identity of any Indian resident.        
	The government is looking at the project to check the duplication of identification that is leading to serious frauds while implementing various government programmes.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Cheap gas for NTPC ruled out
                                                                                                               Cheap gas for NTPC ruled out
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Mumbai, Jan. 13: The government is firm that gas from Reliance Industries field in the Krishna-Godavari basin will be sold at $4.20 per million British thermal unit (mBtu)  and that includes state-owned National Thermal Power Corporation (NTPC).        
	Additional solicitor-general Mohan Parasaran, who is representing the Centre in the dispute between Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL) and Reliance Natural Resources Ltd (RNRL), submitted an affidavit in Bombay High Court that said the price that was fixed by the empowered group of ministers (EGoM) would apply to all customers.        
	In 2004, NTPC and RIL had reached a tentative agreement under which the gas would be supplied to the power utility at $2.34 per mBtu.        
	Anil Ambani-owned RNRL  which was spun out of the Reliance empire after the demerger in 2006  has been insisting that it is entitled to 28 million standard metric cubic metres per day of gas from the KG gasfield.         
	NTPC is fighting its own court case against RIL after the latter refused to honour the agreement after crude oil prices started rising. RIL claimed it had never entered into a formal contract with NTPC.        
	The division bench of Bombay High Court, which is hearing the case between the warring companies owned by the two Ambani brothers, had asked the government counsel to clarify the price at which gas would be sold to the government and its nominees such as NTPC.        
	The affidavit filed on behalf of Union of India and ministry of petroleum and natural gas quoted Article 21.6 of the production sharing contract that all oil and gas prospectors have to sign with the government. This lays down the rule that the government will determine the formula or the price at which gas can be sold.        
	The affidavit said the gas would be sold to the government nominees at the same price as the one fixed by the EGoM.

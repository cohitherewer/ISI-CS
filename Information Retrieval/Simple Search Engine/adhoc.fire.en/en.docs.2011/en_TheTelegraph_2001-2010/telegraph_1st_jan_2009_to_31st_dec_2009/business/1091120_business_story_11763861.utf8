          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                           Cash chase                                  
	Mumbai, Nov. 19: A month after the State Bank of India raised $750 million through five-year dollar-denominated bonds, ICICI Bank is planning to raise $700 million from the global markets.         
	The largest private sector bank of the country will raise the money through senior unsecured bonds that will mature in 2015.         
	Proceeds from the bonds, to be issued by the banks Bahrain branch, will be used for general corporate purposes.         
	The pricing is likely to be 350 basis points over comparable treasury yield. Lead managers to the issue are Bank of America Merrill Lynch, HSBC and Credit Suisse.        
	ICICI Banks issue has been rated Baa2 by Moodys Investors Service and BBB- by Standard amp; Poors Ratings Services.         
	The notes will be listed on the Singapore Stock Exchange.         
	The rating is derived from ICICI Banks financial strength rating, which reflects the banks stand-alone financial strength, which is mainly based on its strong domestic retail and corporate franchise as the second largest commercial bank in India, Nondas Nicolaides, Moodys vice-president and senior analyst said.         
	The SBI bond sale in October was the first international issue from a financial institution from India since September 2007.         
	The proceeds from these bonds, which were part of its medium term notes (MTN) programme, will be used to ramp up its overseas presence.         
	Other banks planning similar issues include Axis Bank and Bank of Baroda.

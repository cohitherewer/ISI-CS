	Calcutta, April 16: HSBC has overhauled its top-level management in India. Naina Lal Kidwai has been appointed chairman of HSBC Group in India. She was previously the group general manager and CEO.         
	Stuart Davis, the CEO of HSBC Australia, will take over as the CEO of the bank in India.        
	The appointments were announced by Stephen K. Green, group chairman of HSBC Holdings Plc, in Calcutta today. India and China are two key markets for HSBC globally. The new structure will help us grow our business here more strongly in the future, Green said.        
	HSBC is setting up a new management board for India. The board, to be headed by Kidwai, will oversee HSBCs operations in the country. The chief executives of all the group businesses in India will be on the board.        
	Apart from banking, which was started in 1855, HSBC is into insurance, insurance broking, investment banking, capital markets, asset management, software development and global resource operation.        
	The financial services group employs about 37,000 people in India, with 7,000 in banking. In Calcutta, it employs around 4,000.        
	Kidwai said the challenge for her was to grow the business.         
	I have to devise a strategy  especially for new businesses like insurance and ILFS Investmart which we recently acquired  nurture them and grow. I need to bring in a basic level of integration in all operations, Kidwai said.        
	With Europe reeling under recession, HSBC hopes Asia, excluding Japan, will lead growth. Green said HSBC expected India to grow 6.2 per cent this year and 8 per cent next year, which was the same as China.        
	The only concern for HSBC is retail where it has taken a hit because of rising defaults.

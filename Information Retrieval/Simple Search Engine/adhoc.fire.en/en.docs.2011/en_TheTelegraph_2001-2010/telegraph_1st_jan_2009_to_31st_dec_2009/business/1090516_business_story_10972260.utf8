	Mumbai, May 15: Jet Airways plans to restructure operations on its domestic and international routes as it struggles to restore the financial health of the faltering airline.        
	The Naresh Goyal-owned airline  which is due to announce its full year results on May 25  has tumbled to the third spot with a market share of 16.7 per cent in April, according to data put out by the ministry of civil aviation. Kingfisher tops the charts with a market share of 26 per cent, followed by Air India (domestic operations) at 17.6 per cent.        
	The airline has withdrawn flights on two international routes  Mumbai-Shanghai-San Francisco and Amritsar-London. It has also replaced larger aircraft like the Boeing 777 that fly West with smaller Airbus 330s and is getting rid of four old 737 400s aircraft. Jet has also given out nine wide-bodied aircraft on a wet lease to Gulf-based airlines and Turkish Airlines.        
	There is a freeze on recruitment and a pruning of executive perks. The management has implemented a salary cut for around 370 senior employees, said a company spokesperson. The airline has also trimmed some of its workforce but did not divulge numbers. The job cuts are miniscule, said the spokesperson.        
	According to Jet sources in Calcutta, 29 cabin crew members of the airline were called for a meeting today. We discussed about the compensation package with them, said an airline official. Sources, however, said close to 50 probationers in Calcutta were refused confirmation and asked to leave on Friday.                          
	He, however, said there was no discussion on lay-offs.

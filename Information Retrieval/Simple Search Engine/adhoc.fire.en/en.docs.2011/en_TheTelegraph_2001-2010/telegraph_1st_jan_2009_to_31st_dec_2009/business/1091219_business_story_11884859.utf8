          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Calcutta, Dec. 18: The Bombay Stock Exchange has launched a platform to settle transactions in corporate bonds/debt securities.         
	At present, these transactions take place over the counter. Both the BSE and NSE have trading platforms for such instruments, but the volumes are insignificant.        
	Now that both the BSE and NSE have adopted RTGS (real-time gross settlement), the risks involved in the settlement of an over-the-counter trading can be done away with, said R.K. Nair, executive director of the Securities and Exchange Board of India.        
	Indian Clearing Corporation Ltd (ICCL), the BSEs wholly owned subsidiary, is the agent for the new platform. Issuers and buyers will have to get themselves registered with ICCL.         
	If any one of the counterparties, that is, the issuer or the buyer fails to deliver securities or payments before a cut-off time, the transaction will be cancelled, said Sayee Srinivasan, BSEs product strategy head.         
	The buyer and the seller will be immediately informed through SMS or email about the securities or payment received by ICCL.

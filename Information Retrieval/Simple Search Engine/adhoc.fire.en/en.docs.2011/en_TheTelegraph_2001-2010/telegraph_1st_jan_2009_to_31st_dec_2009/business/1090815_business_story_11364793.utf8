	Calcutta, Aug. 14: The traditional tax cover on savings has been blown to bits.        
	People who have parked their money in national savings certificates, five-year post office term deposits, senior citizen savings schemes and equity-linked savings schemes (ELSS) of mutual funds will find to their horror that the new draft tax code proposes to bust the tax shelter they have used all these years.        
	This is because the tax breaks for savings  at present available under section 80C of the income tax act  will henceforth be restricted to instruments floated by a new category of permitted savings intermediaries.         
	The code defines the entities that come under this new rubric  approved provident funds, approved superannuation funds, life insurers and the New Pension Trust System.        
	If the tax code is implemented in the form that it has been placed before the public for comment, a number of tax-saving schemes, including ELSS of mutual funds and NSC, will cease to exist.        
	I dont know whether the omission of ELSS and post office schemes is deliberate or an accident. If it is deliberate, it means the government wants to provide tax breaks only on investments that are really long term, more than 10 years, said Dhirendra Kumar, CEO of Value Research. It means the death of tax-saving mutual fund schemes and closure of fixed income investment avenues such as NSC, he added.         
	The total asset under management of ELSS stood at Rs 19,809 crore at the end of July. The amount outstanding in NSC account was Rs 57,388 crore at the end of March 2008.        
	Kumar expected the mutual fund industry to lobby hard for the continuation of tax benefits on ELSS.         
	Otherwise, they will be at a disadvantage vis--vis life insurers selling unit-linked insurance plans. Mutual funds are also not allowed to sell the New Pension Scheme now. But I hope, post implementation of the direct tax code, mutual funds will design and sell longer-term products such as pension plans, he said.        
	Biman Chakraborty, eastern region head of Bajaj Capital, however, argued that small savings schemes were intentionally excluded from tax benefits under the new direct tax code.         
	The interest on small savings is administered and paid by the central government, while it has to share 80 per cent of the net collection under these schemes with states, Chakraborty said.        
	The government had started reducing the interest rate on small savings schemes since 2003 and capping investments by individuals since May 2005.         
	It subsequently reduced the bonus payable on schemes such as the Post Office Monthly Income Scheme.         
	States borrowing from the National Small Savings Fund (NSSF), where the net collections from all small savings schemes are kept, pay an interest rate of 9.5 per cent which is a few percentage points higher than the interest they pay while borrowing from markets through bonds.        
	The new direct tax code not only reduces the number of tax saving options but also prohibits switching or rollover of investment from one scheme to another with the same or different permitted savings intermediary within one financial year.        
	For example, you cannot invest the amount received under a money back life insurance policy in a provident fund account in the same financial year and claim tax benefits for the rollover.

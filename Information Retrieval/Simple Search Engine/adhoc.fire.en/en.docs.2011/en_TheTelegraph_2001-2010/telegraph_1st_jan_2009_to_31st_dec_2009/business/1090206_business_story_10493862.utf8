The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Insider in charge of Satyam   Board picks Murthy as CEO
                                                                                                               Insider in charge of Satyam     Board picks Murthy as CEO
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                                  
	Hyderabad, Feb. 5: The board of directors of Satyam Computer Services today picked A.S. Murthy  an in-house veteran  as its chief executive officer, capping weeks of speculation on the key appointment.        
	Two special advisers  Homi Khusrokhan and Partha S. Datta  will assist Murthy in putting Satyam back on the rails.        
	We are convinced that Satyam needs an internal leader to steer it at this critical juncture, board director Deepak Parekh said after two days of deliberations.         
	The board also confirmed that it had rustled up Rs 600 crore as working capital to run operations.        
	It also appointed a new legal firm in the US  Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen amp; Katz  to handle a rash of class action suits filed against the company by the holders of American depositary receipts.        
	We will chart a precise and practical 30-, 60- and a 90-day plan that will encompass and address the interests of all stakeholders, said Murthy, a 15-year veteran with Satyam who is currently its global delivery officer.        
	Khusrokhan, a former managing director of Tata Chemicals, and Partha Datta, a former chief financial officer at the Murugappa group, will assist Murthy and the board in defining priorities and executing them effectively, a company release said.        
	The two advisers will work pro bono and in tandem with Boston Consulting Group, which had been picked earlier to map strategies for the beleaguered software giant.        
	I have no misgivings about the enormity of the task in front of us but, together with my colleagues, I am confident we can accomplish the impossible, Murthy said.        
	Datta  who will oversee the financial operations  said the primary focus in the next few weeks would be to restate the accounts that Raju had fudged for several years, and come out with the third-quarter results that were due last month.        
	The company also reaffirmed that January worldwide salaries and the fortnightly salary in February (for its US-based associates) had been paid out of internal accruals.        
	The board also reiterated its focus on retaining customers and associates, evaluating long-term strategic options, assessing legal liabilities, undertaking cost rationalisation measures and resuming investment in identified areas.        
	Old-timers at Satyam hailed the appointment of Murthy who once headed the HR function at the organisation. Many expect him to resolve a thicket of issues that employees have been grappling with ever since Rajus damning confession on January 7.        
	Several bidders, including Larsen amp; Toubro, the Mahindras, B.K. Modi, the Hindujas and iGATE, have evinced interest in Satyam. None reacted to Murthys appointment.        
	Meanwhile, marketmen in Mumbai reckoned that the appointment of the new CEO would have no significant impact on the stock.        
	Observers felt that there could be some disappointment since many had speculated that an outsider would be brought in to sort out the mess at the countrys fourth largest software maker.        
	The Satyam scrip today fell 7.7 per cent to Rs 46.25 ahead of the announcement. It has recovered from a 52-week low of Rs 11.50 that it hit soon after Rajus confession.        
	On the NYSE, the Satyam ADR was down 5.21 per cent at $1.82 during mid-day trading.

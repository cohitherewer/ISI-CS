The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Citi to repay bailout money
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Citi to repay bailout money
          BY ERIC DASH AMP; JEFF ZELENY                          Clearing backlog                                  
	Washington, Dec. 14: Citigroup reached a deal early Monday morning to be the last of the big Wall Street banks to exit the governments bailout programme, after persuading regulators that it was sound enough to stand on its own.         
	Citigroup executives announced a broad programme that would replace the $45 billion of federal aid with funds from private investors and allow it to wean itself off other forms of government assistance. With its regulators permission, Citigroup plans to redeem $20 billion of preferred stock that the government received as part of the banks first two rescues late last year. It will also end a loss-sharing agreement with the government on about $250 billion of troubled real estate and credit card assets.         
	To help replenish its coffers, Citigroup expects to raise about $17 billion by selling stock as early as this week and issue another $4.2 billion in so-called tangible equity units and subordinated notes.         
	All three moves aim to assuage regulators concerns about the banks ability to weather another severe economic downturn without returning to the government for more money.        
	The treasury department, meanwhile, plans to wind down its 34 per cent ownership stake in Citigroup, which it acquired by converting $25 billion of preferred shares into common stock in a third rescue this year. It expected to sell its nearly 7.7 billion shares through a series of large stock sales to institutional investors over the next six to twelve months. The first sale, for up to $5 billion of Citigroup shares, is expected to occur alongside the banks $17 billion stock offering.         
	Obama meets bankers        
	President Barack Obama told top US bankers on Monday that they owed the country their help in lifting the economy out of crisis and implored them to lend more money and get behind financial reforms. Given the difficulty that business people are having as lending has declined, and given the exceptional assistance banks received to get them through a difficult time, we expect them to explore every responsible way to help get our economy moving again, Obama said.

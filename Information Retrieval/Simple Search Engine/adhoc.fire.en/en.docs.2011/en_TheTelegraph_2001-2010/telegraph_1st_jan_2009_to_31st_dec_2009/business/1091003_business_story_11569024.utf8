	Mumbai, Oct. 2 (PTI): Precision Cars, the official importer of Porsche models in India, is planning to increase its dealer network from two to six next year, a top company official said.        
	We are expanding our dealer network and want to have a presence in six cities by 2010, Rod Wallace, managing director of Precision Cars, told reporters after launching the Panamera on Thursday.        
	Precision has two dealers  one in Mumbai and the other in New Delhi. It will soon have three more dealers, all in the south.        
	We have signed contracts with dealers in Hyderabad, Kochi and Chennai. These cities will have their local Porsche centres by the end of this year, Wallace said.        
	The company is also in talks with potential partners for dealership in cities such as Ahmedabad, Ludhiana and Bangalore, he said.        
	The new Panamera will be available in three variants  the S, the 4S and the Turbo. The others Porsche models sold in India are the 911, Cayenne, Boxster and the Cayman.        
	The Panamera will increase our volumes in terms of sales in the country. The dealers have 13 confirmed orders of the Panamera even before it arrived in the market, Wallace said. Precision has ordered 50 units of the Panamera to sell in the country over the next nine months, he said.        
	Porsche, which sold 168 units in 2008 in the country, is expecting higher sales in 2009.

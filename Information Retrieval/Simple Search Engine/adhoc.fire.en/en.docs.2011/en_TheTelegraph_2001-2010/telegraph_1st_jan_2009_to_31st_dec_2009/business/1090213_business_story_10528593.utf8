	New Delhi, Feb. 12: The interim railway budget tomorrow may announce fare cuts, more Garib Raths and some other sops.        
	Analysts said railway minister Lalu Prasad was eyeing the Lok Sabha elections.         
	Fares in the sleeper and AC-III tier classes may fall 5-10 per cent. Officials said declining global crude oil prices had given Lalu room for manoeuvre.        
	Lalu, thus, stands to sign out of the railways without raising fares even once  the first by a minister.        
	His acumen in handling the ministry  during his tenure the railways enjoyed sustained growth in income  has won plaudits from many business schools.        
	It is more likely to be a populist interim budget and I will be surprised if fares are raised, said Arvind Mahajan, executive director of KPMG.        
	Passengers are likely to get more Garib Raths, the hugely popular all-AC trains billed as the common mans Rajdhani.        
	Introduced by Lalu in the 2006-07 budget, the railways are now running 20 Garib Raths.        
	New lines or gauge conversions will not be on Lalus agenda, if he follows the convention of not announcing new projects in interim budgets. However, merely implementing the earlier promises of gauge conversions will create enough electoral goodwill.        
	Besides, the politician in Lalu may come to the fore, with the RJD supremo announcing new trains, the bulk for his home state Bihar and Uttar Pradesh where he is keen to extend his influence.        
	Some new trains can be for the states of interest to the Congress such as Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh and Maharashtra.         
	Mahajan said new trains should boost the demand for wagons. He said he was expecting measures on the dedicated freight corridor, the modernisation of stations and real estate projects on railway land under the public-private-partnership model.        
	Shares of wagon makers such as Texmaco and Titagarh Wagons have risen in the past few days.        
	New overbridges and the repair of the older ones are also on Lalus agenda. This will boost infrastructure and the demand for steel and cement, which will benefit the economy suffering from a slowdown. The government today announced that industry growth fell 2 per cent in December.        
	Senior citizens, women and students could get some concessions, while new categories of travellers may be created for reliefs.        
	Freight rates, which contribute 80 per cent to the earnings, are unlikely to see any changes.        
	Only on the first of this month, they were revised for foodgrain, pulses and fertilisers, which were expected to fetch Rs 100 crore by March.        
	Analysts said the rationalisation of the charges were necessary as they were determined on the basis of commodities rather than weight, volume and other parameters.         
	The railways have carried 681.28 million tonnes (mt) of freight in April-January 2009, an increase of 36.59mt, or 5.68 per cent, from 644.69mt in the corresponding period of the previous year.        
	Earnings from freight during the period are up 13.64 per cent to Rs 44,016.26 crore from Rs 38,734.12 crore a year ago.        
	Revenues from passengers were Rs 18,042.82 crore compared with Rs 16,134.94 a year ago, an increase of 11.82 per cent.        
	Overall, income rose 13.17 per cent to Rs 64,876.34 crore from Rs 57,327 crore a year ago. The implementation of the recommendations of the pay commission is likely to erode the margins.

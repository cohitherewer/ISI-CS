The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | BSNL float under threat
                                                                                                               BSNL float under threat
          JAYATI GHOSE                          Connection error                                  
	New Delhi, Aug. 14: Dwindling profits and market share have put a question mark on BSNLs planned maiden flotation.         
	Last year, the BSNL board had cleared a plan to divest 10 per cent in the PSU to raise about Rs 10,000 crore to fund its expansion programme.         
	However, with the company suffering an 80 per cent drop in net profit in 2008-09 and its market share falling to 15 per cent, officials said the listing could be shelved till the company turned around.        
	Opposition from the Left unions has also affected the IPOs prospects.        
	The managements plea that the IPO is necessary to mop up funds for development and expansion is far from the truth as BSNL has more than Rs 37,000 crore in banks. It can be used for expansion instead of selling shares, said V.A.N. Namboodiri, convenor of the Joint Forum of BSNL Associations.        
	The state-run telecom firm has also been struggling to expand its network amid multiple controversies, litigations and delays surrounding its mobile equipment tenders. The company is fighting a court case against equipment vendor Nokia Siemens, which has alleged an unfair allotment of a tender for 93 million lines.        
	For 2008-09, BSNL recorded an 80 per cent drop in its net profit at Rs 575 crore against Rs 3,009 crore in 2007-08. In the last five years, BSNLs revenues from landline connections have dipped more than 45 per cent  from Rs 22,814 crore in 2004-05 to Rs 11,505 crore in 2008-09.        
	Moreover, while the private players are adding over two million mobile subscribers a month, BSNL is barely managing to get about six lakh users.         
	The number of consumers using BSNL connections has also fallen in the last six months by 7.27 lakh to 289.76 lakh in May from 297.03 lakh in November 2008.        
	Lifetime schemes, millions of sleeping customers, a sharp increase in operating expenses and the massive impact of the Sixth Pay Commission are all to blame for BSNLs financials, said senior officials.        
	BSNL has not been able to issue contracts for mobile networks and equipment during the past two years, although their existing networks are running at near full capacity.        
	However, chairman and managing director Kuldeep Goyal is optimistic about the PSUs prospects.         
	We plan to add 100 million subscribers and double the turnover in the next three to five years through a management restructuring exercise, expansion of mobile and broadband networks and focus on sales, marketing, IT and customer care, said Goyal.        
	The drop in profit during the last financial year was mainly on account of an increase in employee cost and a decline in revenue from fixed line services.        
	The company has several plans in the pipeline, including the sharing of towers and optical fibre backbone with competitors, and providing IT services such as firewalls.

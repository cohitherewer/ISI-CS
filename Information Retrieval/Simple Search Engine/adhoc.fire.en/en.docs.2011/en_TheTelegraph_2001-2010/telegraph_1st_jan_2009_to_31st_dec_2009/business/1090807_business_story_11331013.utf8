The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Power firms in turf war over coal
                                                                                                               Power firms in turf war over coal
          JAYANTA ROY CHOWDHURY                          Saran: Listing priorities                                  
	New Delhi, Aug. 6: A lobbying war is raging between thermal power firms near coal mines and those located close to ports over the allocation of the countrys limited domestic coal reserves.        
	The port-based power projects in south and west India were set up in the belief that they would import coal.        
	However, the government has recently started reconsidering its coal linkage policy and is likely to allow the port-based plants to use domestic coal up to 70 per cent of their needs.        
	What this means is that those plants which were earlier supposed to be running on imported coal will be eligible for coal mines in the three eastern states of Bengal, Orissa and Jharkhand and allocations from Coal India Ltd, said Vishambhar Saran, president of the Calcutta-based Indian Chamber of Commerce.        
	It just doesnt make sense to transport huge amounts of coal from eastern India to the western or southern ports. The railways are anyway overloaded, Saran, who also heads Visa Steel, said.        
	In a letter to coal minister Sriprakash Jaiswal, Saran stated that it will not be in national interest to allow the transportation of coal from the eastern region when the IPPs (independent power producers) at these ports can easily meet the requirements through imports.        
	The letter goes on to state that the ICC does not understand why such a policy is even being considered which will only aggravate the deteriorating coal supply situation to power plants.        
	Power firms based near ports, however, say that in a situation of fluctuating global prices, it makes sense to buy domestic coal and haul them over long distances.         
	Prices of coal from countries such as Australia and Indonesia witness massive fluctuations, threatening the viability of the Indian operations.        
	Port-based power plants coming up in southern and western India include the Adani groups 4,620mw plant at Mundra in Gujarat, Unicorn Powergens 1000mw project at Tuticorin in Tamil Nadu and Torrents 1,000mw facility near Pipavav, Gujarat.        
	Officials say the ultimate battle between the two groups will be during coal mine auctions, which will start shortly.         
	Those who have deeper pockets will snap up coal mines and this is one of the principal reasons for the tussle between the two groups, coal ministry officials said.

                                                                                                               Capital bonanza for bank trio 
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                            
	New Delhi, Feb. 11: The government plans to infuse Rs 3,800 crore in two phases into Uco Bank, the Central Bank of India and Vijaya Bank to improve their capital adequacy ratio.        
	Union home minister P. Chidambaram said the first tranche of Rs 1,650 crore would be disbursed in the current fiscal  the provision will be made in the vote-on-account next week  and the remaining in the next fiscal.         
	In the first phase, Uco Bank will get Rs 450 crore, while the Central Bank of India and Vijaya Bank will get Rs 700 crore and Rs 500 crore, respectively.        
	In the next tranche, Uco Bank will get Rs 750 crore, while the other two will receive Rs 700 crore each.        
	Chidambaram said the recapitalisation exercise would help the banks to raise their capital adequacy ratio (CAR) to over 12 per cent, much above the Basel II norm of 9 per cent.        
	Banks have been unable to raise fresh equity after the global financial crisis hit India but need to adhere to the Reserve Banks capital adequacy rules.         
	Besides, they have to meet the rising demand for loans necessary to revive a slowing economy.        
	CAR is the ratio of a banks capital to its risk. Part of the central banks statutory requirement, CAR indicates a banks capacity to absorb losses. If CAR breaches a safe limit, the bank will either infuse more capital or sell risky assets.        
	Though most Indian banks have a CAR well above the Basel I norm of 8 per cent and the RBI requirement of 9 per cent, some are off the mark.        
	The funds will enable the banks to lend more to sectors such as manufacturing and infrastructure, which are witnessing a sharp slowdown.        
	The infusion of funds may increase the governments holding in these banks.         
	Its holding in the Central Bank of India stands at 80.20 per cent, Uco Bank at 75.98 per cent and Vijaya Bank at 53.87 per cent.         
	Central Bank had a net profit of Rs 353 crore in the third quarter, while Vijayas net was Rs 157 crore. In Uco, the profit after tax was Rs 172 crore.

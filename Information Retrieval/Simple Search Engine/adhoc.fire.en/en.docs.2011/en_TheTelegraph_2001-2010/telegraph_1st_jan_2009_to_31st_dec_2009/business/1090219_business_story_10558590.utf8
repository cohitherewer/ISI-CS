The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Detroit icons want more support
                                                                                                               Detroit icons want more support
                              In the queue                            
	Detroit, Feb. 18 (Reuters): General Motors and Chrysler today requested nearly $22 billion in additional US government loans and said they had reached tentative deals with the United Auto Workers union to reduce labour costs.        
	The two auto makers, which have so far received $17.4 billion in loans from the US treasury, also detailed plans to cut jobs and idle plants as part of its restructuring plans submitted under the terms of their federal bailout.        
	GM said it was making progress on complex deals to reduce some $48 billion in debt owed to bondholders and the United Auto Workers union but had fallen short of an initial requirement to complete those agreements by Tuesdays deadline for submitting the plans to US officials.        
	The presidents team will be reviewing these reports closely in the days ahead, White House spokesperson Robert Gibbs said in a statement.         
	GM is seeking an additional $16.6 billion from the US treasury, for a total of up to $30 billion in loans. The company said it would run out of cash as early as March without new federal funding.         
	In addition, GM said it expected to be able to borrow up to $6 billion from foreign governments and nearly $8 billion from the US department of energy. It warned that without $1.5 billion from asset sales in 2009 it would need even more cash.        
	Chrysler sought an additional $5 billion, on top of the $4 billion in US loans it had already been granted, saying it expected the brutal downturn in the US market to run another three years.         
	Each company separately reached a tentative deal with the United Auto Workers, expected to bring labour costs in line with Japanese auto makers operating in the United States.         
	The deal is subject to ratification by some 91,000 hourly workers. Details were not disclosed.        
	The deepening financial problems for GM and Chrysler present the Obama administration with a tough call.        
	Pushing the companies into bankruptcy would cost tens of thousands of jobs just as the White House is aiming to head off a deeper recession. But the price tag for saving GM and Chrysler has now ballooned to $39 billion at a time when Republicans are challenging plans for stepped-up spending and increased debt.        
	Rep. John Dingell, a Michigan Democrat and staunch industry ally, said government must do whatever is possible to preserve the US auto industry.        
	The cost of action will be high, but the cost of inaction will be higher, Dingell said in a statement.        
	At the request of the Obama administration, GM and Chrysler prepared projections claiming the cost to the government of financing a bankruptcy of both could near $125 billion.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Raja seeks Pranab help
                                                                                                               Raja seeks Pranab help
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                          Raja: Determined                                  
	New Delhi, Oct. 20: The telecom ministry, which has failed to persuade the defence forces to vacate third generation radiowaves, has approached the finance ministry with the problem.        
	In a letter to Pranab Mukherjee, telecom minister A. Raja has requested the finance minister to intervene in the matter so as to enable 3G auctions to be completed during the year.        
	The government plans to raise around Rs 35,000 crore by selling spectrum. It is keen to complete the auction by the year-end.        
	You may also consider holding a meeting with defence minister A.K. Antony on the matter, wrote Raja.        
	If the defence-related issues are not resolved soon, the Prime Ministers Office and the empowered group of ministers on 3G may have to step in, said DoT officials.        
	The DoT had earlier scheduled the 3G auction for December but would not be able to meet the deadline as spectrum was not available in all circles.        
	The defence ministry has told the DoT that it would be able to release 20Mhz of spectrum only by June, after switching to the alternative optical fibre network being developed by BSNL. The telecom PSU is expected to complete and operationalise one section of the alternative network by November-end.        
	Due to the stand taken by the defence ministry there has been a slip in the original schedule of auction, Raja said.        
	The government has already set up a high-level committee headed by cabinet secretary K.M. Chandrasekhar to ensure that the defence forces vacate spectrum on time.

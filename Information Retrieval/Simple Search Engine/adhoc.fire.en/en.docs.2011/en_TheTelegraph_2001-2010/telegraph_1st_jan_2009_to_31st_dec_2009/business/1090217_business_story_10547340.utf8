                                                                                                               Rosling to quit Tata Sons
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Rosling: Stepping down                                  
	Mumbai, Feb. 16: Alan Rosling, the executive director of Tata Sons, is stepping down.        
	It was decided by mutual agreement that Alans contract would not be extended beyond March 31, said a Tata group spokesperson. Alan had decided to look for a career change.        
	Roslings exit comes at a time when the $62.5-billion Tata group is bracing to face the challenges thrown up by a spate of international acquisitions from Anglo-Dutch steel maker Corus to Jaguar and Land Rover.        
	Rosling, who oversaw the groups international operations, confirmed the development to a news agency.        
	Rosling was the face of some of the Tata groups early global forays, including the much-publicised Bangladesh plan that envisaged setting up four major projects, including steel, power and fertiliser plants. The plan was later aborted as the Bangladesh government was not in a position to give the Tatas the natural gas commitment that the group required for these greenfield ventures.        
	He publicly voiced his disappointment at not making much headway in Bangladesh and strongly believed that China held great potential for the Tata group as a low-cost sourcing and manufacturing hub. China had been identified as one of the key countries in which group companies such as Indian Hotels and Tata Motors could make progress.        
	Rosling, who visited India for the first time at the age of 20 on a back-packing trip, moved here in the late nineties.         
	He joined the Tatas in 2004 and was a member of the elite executive office that defines and reviews business activities of group companies and the corporate centre  a decision-making body that guides the business endeavours of the conglomerate.        
	He is also a director of Tata AutoComp Systems and Tata International.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Panel pill to widen base of bank agents
                                                                                                               Panel pill to widen base of bank agents
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Mumbai, Aug. 19: Retired teachers, insurance agents and owners of grocery shops and petrol pumps may become bank agents, according to the RBI.        
	Operating in rural and semi-urban areas, the agents offer banking functions  such as the opening and closing of accounts and other financial activities  and, therefore, promote financial inclusion.        
	The agents can operate only outside bank premises.        
	The suggestions were from a working group formed by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) to review the business correspondent or the business facilitator model.         
	It recommended the inclusion of seven new categories.        
	The suggestions, if accepted, will help the Reserve Bank achieve its goals of financial inclusion that it envisaged over three years ago.        
	In 2006, the central bank had allowed banks to use intermediaries to provide financial services.         
	Banks are already using the services of non-government organisations, micro-finance institutions and other civil society bodies as intermediaries. However, there was a demand that more entities be added to the list.        
	Others who could be involved to spread banking functions are medical shop owners, public call office operators, panchayat officials and rural unemployed youth with a minimum secondary school leaving certificate, the working group, which submitted its report on Tuesday, said.

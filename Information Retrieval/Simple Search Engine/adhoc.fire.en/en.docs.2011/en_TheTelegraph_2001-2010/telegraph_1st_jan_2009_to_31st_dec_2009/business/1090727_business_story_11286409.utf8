The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Defence sets 3G spectrum rider
                                                                                                               Defence sets 3G spectrum rider
          JAYATI GHOSE                                                NEW CALL      
	New Delhi, July 26: The defence authorities have agreed to vacate spectrum only when the alternative optic fibre cable network comes into operation, in contrary to their stand in May of immediately releasing some airwaves, or spectrum, through which mobile calls travel.         
	The ministry of defence has agreed to release 25Mhz in 3G band and 20Mhz in 2G band on the operationalisation of a nationwide armed forces network, said defence minister A.K. Antony, adding that the phased release of spectrum is linked to the completion of the network.         
	In May, the communications and defence ministries had signed a memorandum of understanding, under which the armed forces were to immediately release 10Mhz of spectrum for 3G services and 5Mhz for 2G cellular services.         
	However, even after two months of signing the MoU, defence has not vacated spectrum.        
	Defence will release another 5Mhz for 3G services once the department of telecom (DoT) places the supply order for setting up an OFC-based network for the Air Force. The DoT will get 5Mhz more of 3G spectrum and 5Mhz of 2G radiowaves on supply of the equipment. Once the equipment are installed, the armed forces will give up 5Mhz each in 3G and 2G bands. Another 5Mhz of 2G spectrum will be given on commissioning of the optic cable network, the MoU stated.         
	Once the network is completed, the armed forces will release a total of 45 Mhz of 2G and 3G spectrum over a three-year period, the DoT officials said.        
	They said state-owned BSNL and MTNL  who were building the optic fibre system  were on schedule and would be able to start part of the alternative network by 2010-end.         
	The DoT has also sought cabinet sanction for the Rs 9,970 crore required to complete the network.        
	Officials said, A bulk of the alternative network, especially that of the Air Force, is close to being completed and the government sanction for funds is vital to compensate BSNL and MTNL to ensure timely completion of the project.        
	This will enable the defence forces to release non-utilised spectrum as they switch to the alternative network.        
	Spectrum is crucial for all telecom companies as it is the lifeline on which they offer services.        
	The government has missed at least two deadlines for resolving the issue of defence releasing spectrum. Analysts argue that defence does not utilise spectrum efficiently and will be best served by an alternative network based on optical fibre.

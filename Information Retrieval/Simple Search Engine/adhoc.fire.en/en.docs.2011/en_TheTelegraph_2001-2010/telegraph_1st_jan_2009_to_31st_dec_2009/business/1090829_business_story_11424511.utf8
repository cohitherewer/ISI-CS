The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | CESC looks beyond Bengal boundary
                                                                                                               CESC looks beyond Bengal boundary
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Goenka: Charged up                                  
	Calcutta, Aug. 28: CESC Ltd has created a war chest of Rs 1,000 crore to acquire rights for setting up power plants in the country.        
	The flagship of city-based RPG Enterprises is eyeing projects that are yet to take off but have access to critical resources such as land, coal and water.        
	In India, there are many such ventures that are on the blocks. We are looking at a few of them, Sanjiv Goenka, vice-chairman of CESC, said.        
	Today, the company announced that it had bought a 50 per cent stake in a 600MW power project near Nagpur in Maharashtra and had the right to acquire the rest.        
	Dhariwal Infrastructure Private Ltd (DIPL) has 450 acres in its possession apart from steady supply from Coal India, environmental clearances and access to water. This is one of the most advanced power projects in India right now, Goenka said, adding that the acquisition of DIPL marked CESCs first foray outside Bengal.        
	We want to be a national player. There are some more acquisitions on the radar, he said without revealing the names.        
	CESC has been looking to step out of Bengal with new plants but securing land and mines came in the way of speedy executions. It is pursuing projects in Jharkhand, Bihar and Orissa, among others. The company hopes to achieve financial closure for the DIPL project by the end of the year. It will spend Rs 2,800 crore on the project.        
	CESC is likely to pay another Rs 50-100 crore to buy the remaining stake from Manikchand Group of Industries, the promoters of DIPL.        
	Goenka said the Maharashtra plant would be ready in the next three years. It will sell 50 per cent of the power to the state grid at agreed prices and the rest to the others.        
	Another 600MW project in Haldia will achieve financial closure by the end of the year.        
	Spencers deal        
	Spencers, the retail arm of CESC, is likely to offload 20 per cent stake to private equity investors.

	Calcutta, March 7: Mahindra amp; Mahindra (M amp;M) has cut the price of the Scorpio by Rs 34,000-70,000.         
	It has also upgraded the sports utility vehicle (SUV) to meet the Bharat Stage 4 emission norms. The norms will come into force in April 2010.        
	The price of the Scorpio could be reduced because of technological advancement, B. Kapoor, vice-president (sales  automotive sector), said today after unveiling the upgraded vehicle in the city.        
	The price cut will narrow down the difference between the Scorpio and the Xylo, M amp;Ms recently-launched multi-utility vehicle.         
	Since the Xylos launch two months ago, the Scorpio has lost around 25 per cent of its market to it because of the formers lower price. The Scorpio range is now available at Rs 7.20 lakh to Rs 9.19 lakh (ex-showroom Calcutta) and Xylo is priced between Rs 6.35 lakh and Rs 7.84 lakh.         
	M. K. Mathur, zonal head (automotive sector), said the company had recorded a 21 per cent growth in Scorpio sales in the eastern region. Tier II and tier III cities led by Patna are fuelling the growth, he added.

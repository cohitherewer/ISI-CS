  - Priority to KG-D6 block        OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                                  
	Mumbai, Nov. 17: Reliance Industries plans to crank up its gas exploration operations in the lucrative Krishna-Godavari basin and will start work shortly on nine new discoveries in the KG-D6 block.        
	The deep-sea gas block churns out 40 per cent of Indias natural gas production from just three fields at present.        
	The oil-to-petrochemicals giant has already identified 19 gas-yielding sites in the block, which ranks among the fastest deep-water gasfield development projects in the world.        
	Chairman Mukesh Ambani told shareholders today that Reliance had drawn up plans for an aggressive exploration campaign aimed at diversifying its search for new accumulations over the next three years. It aims to drill in a majority of its blocks and also accelerate the campaign in the KG basin.        
	Ambani said Indias largest private conglomerate also planned to set up a petrochemicals plant at Jamnagar and galvanise its organised retailing operations with new strategic partners.        
	The group also aims to create a new template for business transformation that will nurture a new breed of leaders within the organisation who will develop new growth platforms.        
	The RIL chief did not comment on the ongoing legal dispute with his younger brother during his 40-minute address to shareholders.        
	He said Reliance Retail  the groups organised retailing arm  would start expanding again after the short breather last year that followed its initial burst in 2007.        
	This expansion would encompass new cities, new markets and new strategic alliances, Ambani said,        
	The RIL chairman said the company wanted to accomplish a renewed five-platform roadmap for value creation. Apart from exploration, organised retailing, innovation and rural transformation, RIL wants to venture into the renewable energy space as a natural extension of its conventional energy platform.        
	Later, shareholders approved the proposal for a 1:1 bonus issue and cleared a resolution seeking to reappoint Hital Meswani as an executive director with a big salary hike. The company informed the bourses after the meeting that November 27 would be the record date for the bonus issue.        
	However, Ambanis announcements did not impress the stock markets that were looking forward to a grand announcement of a global acquisition. On the Bombay Stock Exchange, the stock slid Rs 14 to close at Rs 2,133.75.        
	It was business as usual and there was nothing exciting in the speech per se, said an oil and gas analyst who did not wish to be identified.        
	Our efforts will be on piloting projects in alternative energy. Research and proof of concept project in biofuel, solar energy and fuel cells, to understand and enable scale-up, would characterise this effort. Our efforts would be to grow the conventional energy and material platform through greater global scale and competitiveness, he said.        
	This expansion would encompass new cities, new markets and new strategic alliances, Ambani said, adding that there would be new product and service offerings and an expanded footprint of stores.        
	In the petrochemicals business, RIL will soon work on completing the project to manufacture 2 million tonnes of olefins and matching downstream capacities. With this addition, the company will have around 4 million tonnes of olefins and downstream capacities.

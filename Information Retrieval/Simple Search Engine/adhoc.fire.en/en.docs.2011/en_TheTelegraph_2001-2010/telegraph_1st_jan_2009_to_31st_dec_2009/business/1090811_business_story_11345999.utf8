                                                                                                               Car sales zoom 31% in July
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Aug. 10: Car sales jumped nearly four fold in July on the back of new rollouts and cheaper loans.         
	Sales grew 30.9 per cent in July against 8 per cent in June. The industry has seen higher sales for the sixth month running, and the percentage gain in July is the biggest since February 2007, when growth stood at 46.52 per cent.        
	According to data of the Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers (Siam), passenger car sales went up to 1,15,067 units in July from 87,901 a year ago.    
	Growth in the passenger car segment was due to the low base effect of last July. Usually sales in June are low due to the monsoon, and they pick up in July, said Dilip Chenoy, director-general of Siam.        
	Cars will continue to witness healthy growth in the next two to three months because of the low base last year, which is an outcome of a demand slump, he said.        
	Hyundai Motor India introduced two i20 hatchback variants in July this year, while Honda Motor launched the Jazz in June.         
	Maruti Suzuki India began selling the Ritz from May.        
	The domestic sales of Maruti rose 31 per cent in July to 60,012 units, while that of Hyundai surged 54 per cent to 23,193 cars.         
	Tata Motors sales rose 21 per cent to 14,537. The Tatas began delivering the Nano from July.        
	The sales of General Motors India, however, fell 15.54 per cent to 3,729 in July from 4,415 units a year ago.        
	According to analysts, car launches in the past few months and price discounts have attracted buyers.        
	Abdul Majeeth, principal consultant (auto sector), Price Waterhouse, said, Auto loans were available at a lower rate of interest in the last few months, the economy is on a revival mode and people are getting attracted by the series of launches.         
	However, car makers are cautious about the future as the weak monsoon this year is likely to affect demand in the rural areas.        
	In July, the industry witnessed total vehicle sales of 9,41,118 units against 7,79,354 units in the same month last year, up 20.76 per cent.

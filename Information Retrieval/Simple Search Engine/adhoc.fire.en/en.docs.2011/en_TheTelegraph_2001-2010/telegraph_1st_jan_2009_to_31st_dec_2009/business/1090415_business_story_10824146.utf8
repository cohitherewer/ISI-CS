The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | India to offer $11bn to IMF
                                                                                                               India to offer $11bn to IMF
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, April 14: India is likely to offer $10-11 billion as its contribution to the IMFs incremental lending corpus at a meeting of G20 finance ministers to be hosted by US treasury secretary Tim Geithner in Washington on April 25.        
	Prior to the G20 meet, Geithner will hold talks with the finance ministers and central bank governors of the G7 group, a club of rich nations.        
	These meetings are a follow-up to the path-breaking G20 summit held in London earlier this month, where the worlds biggest economies agreed to a trillion-dollar rescue plan, including a $500billion corpus for the IMF for loans.        
	The Washington meeting is expected to clear the air on the contribution of each nation. Besides the $10-11 billion to IMF, India could also give another $10 billion to the Asian Development Bank from its foreign exchange reserves.        
	India will get interest on these advances, though the rate will be low as multilateral institutions lend at very low rates. Indias contribution to the IMF kitty is proportionate to its stake in the multilateral institution, which is just over 1.9 per cent.        
	Besides India, the G20 comprises Argentina, Australia, Brazil, China, Indonesia, Mexico, Russia, Saudi Arabia, South Africa, Korea, Turkey and the European Union along with the G7 nations  the US, France, Germany, the UK, Italy, Japan and Canada.        
	The finance ministers meetings are being held ahead of the IMF and World Banks spring meet which is likely to discuss ways to effectively accommodate the demands of emerging economies such as India, China and Brazil.

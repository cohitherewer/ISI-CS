          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                            
	Calcutta, Sept. 29: The primary market is poised for action with four real estate firms today approaching market regulator Sebi to raise Rs 11,093 crore through initial public offering (IPO).        
	At the top of the heap is Delhi-based Emaar MGF, which plans to mop up Rs 3,850 crore, followed by Subrata Roys Sahara City Homes, which hopes to raise up to Rs 3,450 crore.        
	The two other firms are Mumbai-based Lodha Developers and Delhi firm Ambience.        
	The development comes on a day when the BSE sensex touched 16852 after dipping to a low of 7697 in October last year.         
	The sensex had touched 21206 on January 10, 2008 but went into a downswing soon after, sucking many IPOs, including Emaar MGFs, into its vortex.        
	Emaar MGF, where Dubai-based Emaar is the largest shareholder, had to scrap its Rs 7,000-crore IPO in February 2008 as investors found the issue expensive. Though the company subsequently lowered the offer price, it failed to get subscription and the IPO was finally abandoned.        
	Following the revival of the secondary market after the UPA-led coalition came back to power in May, many firms are making a beeline to raise funds through public issues.        
	Sahara, Lodha and Ambience are hitting the market for the first time, while developers such as DLF, Unitech and Omaxe have raised equity through qualified institutional placements (QIPs).        
	The issues of Adani Power and public sector NHPC Ltd were hugely oversubscribed in recent times, but investors did not warm up to them. The scrips gave marginal gains to investors after listing,raising serious questions about the aggressive pricing of the issues.        
	NHPC is now trading below its issue price and so are most of the real estate firms, including DLF, that had hit the market before the bear phase started in January 2008.        
	It remains to be seen how the four real estates firms price their issues. Experts say the housing market has revived  sales are buoyant though the profit margins have come down.        
	While most of the QIPs were done to retire debt and de-stress the balance sheet by reducing interest costs, IPOs are mostly to fund expansion.        
	Sahara said it would use the funds raised from the IPO to develop residential and commercial projects in 99 cities. The company claims to have a land bank of over 8,000 acres with a saleable area of 419 million sq feet.        
	Lodha Developers is working on about 40 projects, mostly residential properties, and has a land bank of 200 million square feet.        
	Ambience claims to have a land bank of 800 acres, of which about 100 acres are under development.        
	However, the claims of real estate firms about their land holdings have been a point of dispute in the past.

	New Delhi, Aug. 11: A delegation of business leaders today met Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and demanded a cut in interest rates, easier land acquisition rules for industry and farm sector reforms.         
	To facilitate easier movement of foodgrain from surplus to deficit areas we must resolve the issues related to the agriculture produce marketing act (APMC), the delegation said. The group comprised Ficci president Harsh Pati Singhania and secretary-general Amit Mitra, industrialists Rajan Bharti Mittal, Saroj Poddar, Y.K. Modi and Shivinder Mohan Singh.         
	Ficci said it had no formula for helping industry acquire land but was flagging the issue as important to growth. Industry wants the APMC to be amended to ease the transport of farm produce between states and to allow traders to hold larger stockpiles of grain. However, the government may allow the free movement of food to deficit areas but is likely to continue with the curbs on hoarding.         
	The industry also wants a comprehensive plan for better seed provisioning, improved farm practices, organised retail, cold chain and warehousing.        
	Singhania said investments in agri-market infrastructure should be part of the priority lending of banks. Ensuring adequate liquidity is also a key issue.

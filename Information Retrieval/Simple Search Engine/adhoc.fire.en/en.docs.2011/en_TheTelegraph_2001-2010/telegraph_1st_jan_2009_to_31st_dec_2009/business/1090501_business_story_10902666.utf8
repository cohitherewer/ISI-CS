The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Chrysler ready for fresh start
                                                                                                               Chrysler ready for fresh start
										      MICHELINE MAYNARD                        Road ahead				                                 
	Detroit, April 30: Chrysler, the third-largest American auto company, will seek bankruptcy protection and enter an alliance with the Italian auto maker Fiat, the White House announced on Thursday.  
	The bankruptcy case, which officials envisioned as a swift, ldquo;surgical rdquo; process, was filed in United States Bankruptcy Court in New York. It marks the first time a major American car company has tried to restructure under bankruptcy protection since Studebaker in 1933.  
	 ldquo;I have every confidence that Chrysler will emerge from this process stronger and more competitive, rdquo; President Barack Obama said during a noontime appearance at the White House.  
	The President emphasised the speed with which the administration expects the bankruptcy process to be completed, saying that it would be ldquo;quick, official and controlled rdquo; and that the lives of those who work at Chrysler or live in communities where the company has its operations would not be disrupted.  
	Obama said the partnership with Fiat ldquo;will give Chrysler not only a chance to survive but also to thrive in the global auto industry rdquo;. He said it was made possible by a series of sacrifices by Chrysler stakeholders, such as the United Automobile Workers union. More sacrifices were in store, he added.  
	But the President was critical of investment funds that rejected the government rsquo;s settlement offer, saying they hoped to benefit from the sacrifices of others while making none of their own. ldquo;I don rsquo;t stand with them, rdquo; he said in a stern tone.  
	Chrysler rsquo;s chief executive Robert L. Nardelli said he would leave Chrysler after it emerged from bankruptcy protection. He said Chrysler would be run by a new nine-member board, including three representatives from Fiat. The board will select a new chief executive. Nardelli said the government did not ask him to leave, but that he felt it would be appropriate to do so.  
	The bankruptcy filing could serve as a preview of what a filing by General Motors might look like. GM, which like Chrysler received federal assistance last year, faces a June 1 deadline for its own restructuring.

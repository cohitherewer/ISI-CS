	New Delhi, July 31: Maruti Suzuki India, the countrys largest car maker, has raised its capital expenditure (capex) for the current fiscal to Rs 2,100 crore from Rs 1,800 crore to boost research and development. This marks an increase of Rs 425 crore over last years capex of Rs 1,675 crore.         
	Besides research, other focus areas will be product launches and plant upgrades. The company has already pumped in Rs 310 crore in the last quarter. Developing R amp;D is one of our top priorities. This is necessary to meet our aggressive plan for new models and next-generation engines, said S. Nakanishi, managing director of Maruti Suzuki India.        
	Maruti engineers have helped in the designing of the Swift, the upgrades of the Zen, WagonR, Omni, Swift DZire, A-star and Ritz to make them suitable for Indian conditions. They also had a major role in designing the A-Star. The company wants to enhance the R amp;D capability so that by 2012 its engineers are able to design and develop an India car.         
	Maruti has introduced its new KB-series engines with the launch of the Ritz and the A-star. The A-star was launched last year, while the Ritz was rolled out in May this year. The company plans to incorporate the engines in its existing as well as new models. It has set a sales target of 1 million units by 2010-11.         
	Led by the A-star, exports rose 135 per cent in the first quarter. In February this year, the A-star was launched in Europe as Suzuki Alto. Since then, the company has exported over 50,000 units to countries such as Germany, the UK, Italy, France and the Netherlands.

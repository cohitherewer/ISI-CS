	Calcutta, Sept. 1: The Board for Reconstruction of Public Sector Enterprises wants the government to revive the Central Inland Water Transport Corporation that provides an important trade link between the eastern and northeastern states via Bangladesh.        
	BRPSE chairman Nitish Sengupta said this could be done through a joint venture with private companies, including those from Bangladesh.         
	The ailing corporation will have to be revived for the sake of developing trade links with the states of the Northeast. Besides, India has an existing river transit protocol with Bangladesh. So, the corporation cannot be sold to any private company, Sengupta said.         
	Hence, we have recommended that the PSU should be revived through a joint venture with private companies, including ones from Bangladesh, he added.         
	In March this year, the Union government initiated talks with its Bangladesh counterpart for renewing a river transport protocol which was last renewed in 2007. It was first signed in 1980 under a bilateral trade agreement with Bangladesh.

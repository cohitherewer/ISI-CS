          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Calcutta, April 25: UTI Asset Management Company hopes to finalise a strategic equity partner in the next three months.         
	UTI AMC chairman and managing director U.K. Sinha said, We have shortlisted three companies and, given the current state of discussions, we hope to complete the selection in the next three months.        
	The four promoters of UTI AMC  the State Bank of India, Bank of Baroda, Punjab National Bank and Life Insurance Corporation of India  holding 25 per cent stake each will together divest 26 per cent equity in the mutual fund.        
	Declining to name the shortlisted companies, Sinha said, Our criteria for selecting a strategic partner are that it should provide state-of-the-art technology to our domestic operations and augment our offshore business.        
	A few years ago, UTI AMC had entered into an agreement with the US-based asset management company, State Street Global Services, to offer advice on its offshore funds as well as sell those funds in global markets.         
	At present, UTI AMC manages assets worth $200 million under its offshore funds.         
	Its total asset under management at the end of March 2009 stood at Rs 48,754 crore, down from Rs 49,225 crore at the end of February.

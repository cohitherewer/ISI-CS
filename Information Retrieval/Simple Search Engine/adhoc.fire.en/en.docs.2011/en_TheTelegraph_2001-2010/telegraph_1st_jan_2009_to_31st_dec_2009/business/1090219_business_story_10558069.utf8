The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Satyam for auction to pick buyer   Tech firm seeks CLB nod to hike capital
                                                                                                               Satyam for auction to pick buyer     Tech firm seeks CLB nod to hike capital
          OUR BUREAU                                                  
	Feb. 18: Satyam Computer Services today approached the Company Law Board (CLB) for permission to conduct a public auction to find a strategic investor who will run the scam-tainted infotech giant.        
	The government-appointed board of Satyam also sought CLBs approval to raise the companys authorised capital to Rs 240 crore from Rs 160 crore and make a preferential allotment of equity to the winning bidder.        
	The current authorised capital comprises 80 crore shares with a face value of Rs 2 each.        
	The petition said the company would consider making preferential allotment of equity shares or other securities to finance operating and capital costs and meet other funding requirements without holding an annual general meeting.        
	Private equity sources said the bidder might have to be ready to stump up as much as Rs 1,500 crore for a 31 per cent stake in the company.         
	This calculation is based on the assumption that Satyams equity capital  Rs 134.10 crore on March 31, 2008  would rise in proportion to the increase in the authorised capital and that the strategic investor would have to underwrite the entire capital hike.        
	The Satyam stock closed today at Rs 48.55 on the Bombay Stock Exchange.        
	Investment bankers said the new owner of Satyam would probably end up with a 51 per cent stake in the company as it would have to come out with an open offer of 20 per cent.        
	Thats a very large transaction and its likely that the bidders will have to team up with private equity players to raise that kind of money, said a specialist in mergers and acquisitions.        
	Larsen amp; Toubro, HCL Technologies, the Hinduja group, Tech Mahindra and BK Modis Spice Group have evinced interest in Satyam. Goldman Sachs and Avendus Capital are assisting the company in the strategic sale.        
	Last Friday, Sebi issued an amendment to its Substantial Acquisition of Shares and Takeovers Regulations under which it proposed to relax any or some of the provisions of chapter III of the code. Many saw this as a move to help Satyam find a strategic investor who may have to come out with an open offer on softer terms. However, Sebi has not explicitly said this as yet. Satyam will have to approach the capital market regulator once it decides on the modalities of its competitive bidding process.        
	The move to go in for a public auction also means that Larsen and Toubro  which holds a 12 per cent stake in Satyam  will not have any advantage over the other bidders.         
	If it decides to participate, L amp;T will have to bid along with everyone else for the new pool of stock that Satyam proposes to create. Larsen amp; Toubros chief executive A.M. Naik refused to comment on this development.        
	Many expect Sebi to relax the formula for calculating the open offer price which is based on a 26-week average. The Satyam stock plunged dramatically after founder B. Ramalinga Rajus startling admission of fraud on January 7. This has created a special case that warrants a different formula for calculating the open offer price.        
	Satyam submitted to the CLB that once the bidding process was approved, the funds received by it would be kept in a no-lien account with IDBI Bank and Bank of Baroda, which recently gave the company a Rs 600-crore loan to meet working capital requirements.        
	The Satyam board will have the full discretion to accept or reject such requests and furnish the pre-qualified bidders with the confidential information about the company on the payment of a refundable fee of Rs 5 crore.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Tribunal upholds ban on Sharma
                                                                                                               Tribunal upholds ban on Sharma
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Mumbai, Oct. 28: The Securities and Appellate Tribunal (SAT) today upheld the one-year trading ban on Shankar Sharma of First Global Stock Broking Pvt Ltd.        
	Market regulator Sebi had imposed the ban on Sharma from February 13 after an investigation revealed that he indulged in fictitious transactions in about 10 stocks dating back in 2001. However, the tribunal deferred the implementation of the ban until its next hearing on November 3.        
	Sebi had found Sharma guilty of synchronising trades on a large scale in certain scrips that resulted in the creation of artificial volumes. Sharma had subsequently appealed against this order and had won an interim stay from the SAT in March.        
	We have no hesitation to hold that these trades were fictitious as there was no change in the beneficial ownership of the shares traded and it was the appellant (Sharma) on both sides of the trade, ruled the SAT bench comprising Justices N.K. Sodhi and Samar Ray.        
	We are, therefore, satisfied that the appellant executed fictitious trades by taking opposite positions, which is not permissible. The trades were also manipulative in as much as the buy and sell orders were placed at almost the same time, the bench said.        
	Somasekhar Sundaresan, counsel for Sharma, said they would file an appeal against the SAT order.

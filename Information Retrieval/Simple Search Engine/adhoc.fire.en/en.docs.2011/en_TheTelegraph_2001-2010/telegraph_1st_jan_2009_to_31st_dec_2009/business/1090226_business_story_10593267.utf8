The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | L amp;T to take it easy
                                                                                                               L amp;T to take it easy
          OUR BUREAU                          Naik: Long-term view                                  
	Mumbai/Hyderabad, Feb. 25: Larsen amp; Toubro (L amp;T), which is now the single largest investor in Satyam Computer Services, will hold on to its 12 per cent holding even if it is not successful in acquiring the software services company.        
	There is no question of selling our stake, L amp;T chairman A. M. Naik said in Mumbai today. Naik was speaking to newspersons after being felicitated by the Indian Merchants Chamber.        
	Whoever gets it (Satyam), I am sure will create a lot of value in the company. I will trust the company. Even my share price will go up, he added.         
	While the Hinduja and Spice groups are keen on Satyam, it seems L amp;T can aggressively bid for the company.         
	However, Naik indicated that the engineering and construction giant would wait for the bid process and other details from the Satyam board and then take a decision on the submission of an expression of interest.        
	The board of directors of Satyam will meet in Hyderabad tomorrow and it is expected that it will finalise the bidding guidelines.         
	The Andhra Pradesh government today assured necessary infrastructure to the CBI, probing the Rs 7,100-crore Satyam fraud, by Saturday after the agency informed the high court that the investigation was yet to make any headway because of lack of support from the state.        
	The state government has assured the CBI that necessary infrastructure, including location of a camp office and other logistics, would be provided to the CBI by Saturday, official sources said.

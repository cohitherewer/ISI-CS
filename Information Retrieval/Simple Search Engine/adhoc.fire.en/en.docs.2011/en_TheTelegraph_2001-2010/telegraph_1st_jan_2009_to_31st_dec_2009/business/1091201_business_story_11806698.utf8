          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Tech savvy                                  
	Mumbai, Nov. 30: Investors can finally buy or sell units of their favourite mutual funds online.        
	The National Stock Exchange today permitted transactions in the units of mutual funds on its online platform. The transactions will have to be routed through an NSE broker.         
	Initially, investors will be able to trade only in the 30 schemes of UTI Mutual Fund.         
	Senior NSE officials said fund houses such as Tata Mutual Fund, Reliance Mutual Fund, Birla Sun Life, ICICI Prudential Mutual Fund and Fidelity would come on board in the next few days.        
	Online trading in the units of mutual funds has started just two weeks after the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) allowed transactions in mutual fund units through the stock exchange infrastructure.        
	UTI Mutual Fund today took the lead in providing such a platform for investors by joining hands with the NSE. A separate module has been provided by the National Stock Exchange for entering purchase and redemption requests of UTI mutual fund units to NSE brokers who are also ARN holders (mutual fund distributors).        
	The exchange is offering its Mutual Fund Service System (MFSS), the platform on which mutual fund units can be traded through stock exchange infrastructure.         
	To begin with, there will be 20 brokerages, which will provide investors this facility. Terminals of NSE brokers will be the official point of acceptance. Thus, the date of acceptance of the transaction will be the date of entering the request on the terminal.        
	According to UTI MF, investors will have the added advantage of obtaining the same days net asset value at a large number of outlets. The investors can obtain their units in either a physical or a dematerialised mode.                          
	U.K. Sinha, chairman and managing director of UTI Asset Management Company Ltd, said, The tie-up with NSE will be an additional facility provided to investors and will work along with the existing distribution network. This tie-up will enable UTI Mutual Fund to reach out to more number of investors across the country. The National Stock Exchange has more than 1,50,000 terminals across 1500 towns and cities.        
	He added that the arrangement with NSE would facilitate quicker settlement of transactions and provide a single window to demat holders.        
	The UTI schemes that can be traded through the NSE platform include UTI Mastershare, UTI MNC Fund, UTI MIS Advantage Plan, UTI Masterplus, UTI Opportunities Fund, UTI Short Term Income Fund, UTI Equity Fund, UTI Wealth Builder Fund, UTI Contra Fund, and UTI Banking Sector Fund.        
	These include HDFC Securities, Geojit BNP Paribas, Anagram Stock Broking, and IIFL. Interestingly, brokerages like Geojit do not intend to charge any commission from clients who wish to use this facility in December.        
	Other brokerages may follow Geojits lead but many reckon that they will eventually charge a commission that is equivalent to that levied on the sale or purchase of shares.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Tourism catches Mexican flu
                                                                                                               Tourism catches Mexican flu

	New Delhi, May 10: The swine flu has dealt a blow to local tourism, which is yet to recover from the impact of the Mumbai terror attacks and the economic slowdown.         
	The fear of the flu  which originated in Mexico  has spread across continents and is affecting both flight and hotel bookings.         
	Leisure and family travel will be impacted most. However, business travel will continue, said Pradeep Lulla, president of the Travel Agents Federation of India.        
	The industry is not yet putting a number to the potential losses from the flu. According to experts, it may result in 30 per cent erosion in revenues.         
	India has issued a travel advisory asking citizens to avoid non-essential travel to New Zealand, Mexico, the US, Canada, Spain, France and Britain. Indians travel most to the US, the UK, the Gulf countries and Southeast Asia.         
	The US and Canada  which have taken the biggest hit from the economic downturn  have a bigger crisis to tackle.         
	Travel to these countries is expected to drop 15-20 per cent at a time when hotel rates in the US are already down almost 50 per cent.        
	Most of the corporate travel is undertaken by professionals from the IT and the ITeS industry and both the US and the UK are their big markets. They will continue going but may postpone travel by a few weeks, said Subhash Goyal, chairman of Stic Travel.        
	Outbound travel from India usually picks up in early May.         
	According to experts, since a very small part of the countrys traffic is bound for Mexico, the outbound travel will not see a big impact.         
	However, if the flu spreads to the US  which accounts for 12-15 per cent of the revenues of a local travel company  it will have a serious impact.        
	Tourism ministry data show the number of tourists visiting the country has declined to 4,71,627 in March this year from 5,41,478 a year ago.        
	The fall in arrivals has also impacted foreign exchange earnings.

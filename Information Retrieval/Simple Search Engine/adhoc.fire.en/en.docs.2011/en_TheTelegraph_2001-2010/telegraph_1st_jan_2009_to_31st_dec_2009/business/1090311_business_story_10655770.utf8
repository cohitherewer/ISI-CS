	New Delhi, March 10: SkodaAuto India is planning to launch a two-litre diesel car later this year.         
	In the next three to five months we plan to launch a two-litre diesel variant of the Superb, said Thomas Kuehl, SkodaAuto India board member (sales and marketing).         
	The 3.6-litre petrol variant of the Superb may come in at the end of this year or early next year, he said.         
	Skoda today relaunched its Superb 1.8-litre petrol car, priced at Rs 18.88 lakh (ex-showroom, Delhi). The car comes with seven gears.        
	Skoda is also planning to launch a small car, to be priced below its entry-level Fabia, which comes for around Rs 5 lakh.        
	The small car will be launched in the next 3-5 years, Kuehl said.        
	Other models available in India are the Laura and Octavia. Skoda has a network of 60 dealers across the country and sold over 65,000 cars since 2001.

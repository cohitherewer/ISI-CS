The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Sensex regains 10K peak
                                                                                                               Sensex regains 10K peak
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                  
	Mumbai, March 26: The sensex scaled 10,000 points once again today  the first time since January 7.        
	The 335-point surge in the bellwether index was triggered by a sharp fall in the rate of inflation to 0.27 per cent  the lowest level in 30 years  and the first signals of a recovery in the US economy that fuelled optimism that global growth would stabilise.        
	The ballast was also provided by a burst of short-covering on the last day of the March derivative contracts.        
	After opening in positive territory at 9739.93, the index consolidated its gains on strong buying from both domestic and foreign institutional investors across several counters. The index touched an intra-day high of 10061.36 and closed at 10003.10, a gain of 335.20 points or 3.47 per cent.         
	The sensex had slumped below 10000 after Satyam founder B. Ramalinga Raju admitted that he had cooked the books at the software giant for years  and it never recovered since.        
	The sensex has jumped 1036.42 points, or 11.56 per cent, in a four-day rally.        
	The National Stock Exchanges 50-share Nifty also finished above 3000 at 3082.25, a net rise of 97.90 points or 3.28 per cent from the previous close of 2984.35.        
	Mavens said the world markets were agog after the US released new data which showed that consumer durables growth  a key economic indicator  had gained the most since December 2007. Just last month, the US reported sales of new homes had increased from a record low in January. The double dose of good news sparked rallies across markets. The lower inflation data also stoked expectations that the RBI could announce another rate cut soon.        
	The positive turnaround is due to the belief that the US bailout plans will help resurrect the US financial system soon which will ease the global liquidity situation, and money will again flow towards markets like India. The emerging markets are likely to be the first to herald the sustained global bull run in equities when it occurs, said Dinesh Thakkar of Angel Broking.        
	The big question is whether this is just a blip or the first sign of a sustained rally.         
	Experts chose to play it safe and said the next week could provide some clues.

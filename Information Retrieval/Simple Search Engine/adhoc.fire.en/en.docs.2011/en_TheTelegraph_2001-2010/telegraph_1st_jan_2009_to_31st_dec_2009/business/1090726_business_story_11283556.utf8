The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Dunlop blames it on power
                                                                                                               Dunlop blames it on power
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                    
	Calcutta, July 25: Work at Dunlops Sahagunj plant may be suspended again as the company is yet to get power to restart production.         
	West Bengal State Electricity Distribution Company Ltd has stopped supply to the unit as the tyre company owes it Rs 13 crore.         
	On March 6, Dunlop had lifted suspension of work at the unit and called back 229 of the 1,189 workers on the rolls. However, production has not yet taken off.        
	The company has taken the state agency to Chinsurah district court in Hooghly over the disruption in power supply. The matter has been heard and judgment is awaited.        
	Dunlop chairman Pawan Ruia said the management would have to hold back operations if the plant could not be opened in the next one month. We are incurring Rs 3 crore in expenses every month. This is not sustainable for long, Ruia said after the annual general meeting of the company. If work is suspended, workers will not get their wages.        
	According to Ruia, power was consumed during the five years when the plant remained closed under the erstwhile Chhabria management.        
	Normally, power connection is cut if dues are not paid within 1-2 months. In this case, the state agency did not do so though no bill was paid for five years, he said.        
	In a desperate attempt to open the plant, the present management had offered to clear the dues after two years. But the state agency turned down the offer and the matter ended up in the court.        
	Open offer        
	The Securities Appellate Tribunal has appointed auditing firm Deloitte to carry out a valuation of Dunlop and arrive at a fair price for a open offer.         
	Sebi had asked Ruia to make an offer at Rs 43 a share after he acquired the company in late 2005. Ruia challenged the Sebi verdict. Deloitte will take a month to complete the valuation.

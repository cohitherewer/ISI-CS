The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Tatas earn Corus loan relief
                                                                                                               Tatas earn Corus loan relief
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Credit breather                                  
	Calcutta, May 30: Tata Steel has received a breather from the lenders who had financed the companys $12-billion buyout of Anglo-Dutch Corus in 2007.        
	The steel maker today said the lenders had unanimously agreed to ease the terms for the 3.7-billion ($5.82 billion) acquisition-related debt for its 100 per cent subsidiary Tata Steel UK.        
	The breather from the bankers came after the Tata group, which is struggling with various costly overseas acquisitions, including Jaguar amp; Land Rover and Brunner Mond in the UK, offered to pump 425 million or $687 million into Corus.        
	This includes pre-payment of 200 million or $323 million of debt to lenders to de-leverage the European balance sheet.        
	The revised covenant package does not involve any additional financing from the lenders or rescheduling of its debt-servicing commitments.        
	The covenant resetting agreement demonstrates the strong relationship of the Tata Steel group with its lenders and underlines the commitment of Tata Steel to its European operations, said Koushik Chatterjee, chief financial officer of the group.        
	It is important to highlight that, despite the challenging financial environment, there will be no increase in the debt-servicing costs of Tata Steel UK. The group continues to have adequate liquidity and has no material repayment obligations or refinancing requirements in the next 12 months, he added.        
	As part of the agreement reached with the banks, there will be no increase in interest costs for the remaining period of the loan.        
	When the fund was borrowed from the banks in 2007, steel demand was buoyant and prices were strong. The economic environment changed from September 2008 with a steep fall in global steel demand and prices.        
	It is projected that steel consumption will go down by 15 per cent this year.         
	Corus is one of the hardest hit and is operating at 55 per cent capacity.         
	As a result, the performance parameters, on the basis of which lenders had given the loan to Tata Steel, had changed. The new covenants will reflect the changed scenario.        
	Kirby Adams, CEO of Corus, said, This overwhelmingly response from our lenders is a mark of their underlying faith in our business, even as we explore options for Teesside Cast Products.        
	The company will continue its focus on improving operating efficiency, as well as enhancing customer relations and revenues through better product quality and service. We also look forward to stronger commercial relations with suppliers through an improved credit profile.         
	Corus is Europes second largest steel producer with annual revenues of more than 12 billion and crude steel capacity of about 20 million tonnes.         
	With operations primarily in the UK and the Netherlands, Corus supplies steel and related services to different industries such as construction, automotive and packaging.

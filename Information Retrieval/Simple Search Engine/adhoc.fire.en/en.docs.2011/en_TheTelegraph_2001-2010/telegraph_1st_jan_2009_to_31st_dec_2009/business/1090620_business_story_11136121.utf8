          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Calcutta, June 19: Heavy Engineering Corporation Ltd (HEC) may team up with Skoda to make locomotives in India.        
	The public sector unit has initiated talks with the Czech company for a possible collaboration.        
	G.K. Pillai, chairman and managing director of HEC, said a core team was working on the project.        
	We have excess land which can be used for manufacturing locomotives, Pillai said in Calcutta today.        
	The company management has decided to discuss the proposal with railway minister Mamata Banerjee.        
	Ranchi-based HEC has been considering various options as it nears the end of a financial restructuring exercise that will make its net worth positive.        
	It plans to build a specialised nuclear grade foundry and enter the defence sector.         
	At present, it is supplying equipment to coal and steel companies.        
	HEC has been saddled with old technology and cash flow problems.         
	However, it hopes to wipe out its accumulated loss next month when it gets a Rs 250-crore grant from the Jharkhand government for returning 2,000 acres of unused leased land.         
	The company reported a turnover of Rs 451 crore last fiscal. HEC has been reporting profit over the last three years.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | For a secure future
                                                                                                               For a secure future
        The new pension scheme can bring about radical changes in the social security system, but some tax-related hurdles may play spoilsport, say Sudhir Kapadia and Jay Unarkar                                            
	The Pension Fund Regulatory and Development Authority (PFRDA) will issue investment guidelines for its New Pension Scheme by the middle of this month.         
	Provident fund  the conventional mode of social security  does not compulsorily cover employees whose monthly salary exceeds Rs 6,500. It is optional for the others to seek the cover. Over a period of time, individuals have been parking funds with annuity plans of insurance companies for future use.        
	Though provident fund contributions have now been made compulsory even for expatriate employees, those in the unorganised sector are left out of this scheme. The new plan is part of the governments efforts to bring all citizens under a social security cover.        
	Under the New Pension Scheme (NPS) for central government employees who joined service on or after January 1, 2004, the employer (in this case the government) has to match the employees contribution to the fund. For non-government employees, the employer will be under no obligation to match the employees contributions.         
	Options available        
	Non-government employees can create a pension plan from a mix of investment options as suggested by the Deepak Parekh committee. Depending on their risk appetite, the employee can choose to invest his funds in equity, government securities, corporate bonds and bank deposits.        
	The regulator wants to launch the scheme for all citizens on May 1, 2009, after it receives an approval from the Election Commission. It had earlier wanted to launch the scheme on April 1, 2009, but the government deferred the plan because of the model code of conduct for elections.        
	The PFRDA has selected six entities  IDFC Mutual Fund, Kotak Mahindra, the State Bank of India, UTI Asset Management, ICICI Prudential Life Insurance and Reliance MF  to manage the corpus. The National Securities Depository Ltd (NSDL) is the central record keeping agency.         
	The return-risk balance will vary for the different asset classes. While investments in equities generate a higher return at a greater risk, bank fixed deposits will yield lower returns at a lesser risk. Investments in government securities and private and public sector corporate bonds will offer a medium return.        
	There will also be a default asset class, called auto choice, which will be customised based on the age of the contributor and will operate like a life-cycle fund.         
	Hence, it is for the employee to decide the investment mix  the relative proportion of the money that should be invested in equities and debentures.        
	For the safety of investors, the fund managers have been allowed to buy only the shares of the 50-stock National Stock Exchanges Nifty under equity investment. The contributor can access the product from the Points of Presence (PoP)  banks, life insurance companies and mutual funds.         
	Advantage all        
	The NPS is a long-term investment plan that will enable investors to plan their retirement over 30-40 years.         
	The different asset classes will offer investors the flexibility to select their preferred mode of investment.        
	A unique identification number will ensure portability across geographies and jobs.         
	With the PSU banks acting as PoPs, access to registration and information should not be a constraint, while the NSDL will look after the back-end processing and record maintenance.        
	The biggest beneficiaries will be those in the unorganised sector who do not have any social safety post retirement.         
	Employees in the organised sector will for the first time have an investment instrument beyond the traditional provident fund.        
	The NPS is at a nascent stage and it is difficult to predict the future growth of the scheme. However, a survey reveals that 8 crore employees are expected to join the scheme over the next five to seven years.        
	Tax status        
	What are the tax sops for the scheme? Unlike other pension products, NPS is subject to the exempt, exempt, tax system.        
	At present, instruments such as the Employees Provident Fund (EPF), the Public Provident Fund (PPF) and the General Provident Fund (GPF) dont attract any tax.         
	Contribution, returns and withdrawals under PPF, EPF and GPF are exempt from tax, while in the NPS, only contribution and returns will not attract tax. Withdrawal under the NPS is taxable         
	Further, receipts from superannuation funds are also tax-free. But if the employers contribution is more than Rs 100,000 per employee, it will be subject to fringe benefit tax for the former.        
	Even the interest income from equity investments is tax-exempt.        
	The favourable tax treatment for PPF, EPF and GPF may work against the NPS. The insurance regulator is in talks with the government to make the scheme tax-exempt at the withdrawal stage to provide a level-playing field with the existing products.         
	The lack of tax incentive could hold back common investors from subscribing to the NPS.         
	One has to now hope that the NPS is made fully tax-exempt to ensure its popularity and success as the first-ever pension scheme covering all Indian citizens.        
	Sudhir Kapadia is partner and Jay Unarkar is manager with Ernst amp; Young                          
	This NPS has all the ingredients to bring about radical changes in the way pensions are planned in the country. It will not only help mobilise the savings of the common man but also contribute to the growth of the economy by channelising the funds to infrastructure sectors.

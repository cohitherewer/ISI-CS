The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Pay bonanza for Mukesh cousin   RIL seeks investor nod for salary hike
                                                                                                               Pay bonanza for Mukesh cousin     RIL seeks investor nod for salary hike
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                                  
	Mumbai, Oct. 21: Shareholders of Reliance Industries are being asked to approve an almost 600 per cent salary hike for Hital Meswani  a move that seems to fly in the face of cousin Mukesh Ambanis grand austerity gesture last week to slash his pay packet by Rs 29 crore.        
	The Reliance shareholders will meet next month to pass a raft of resolutions, including an already announced 1:1 bonus issue, a Rs 13 dividend per share and executive director Hital Meswanis reappointment and new pay structure.        
	Meswanis term as executive director is due to end on August 4, 2010. The shareholders are being asked to grant him a five-year extension from that date.         
	Similar resolutions were cleared last year in the case of Mukesh Ambani and Nikhil Meswani.        
	Reliance Industries annual report for 2008-09 says the Meswani brothers earned a total remuneration of Rs 10.93 crore each.         
	This means they took a paltry 1.7 per cent cut on their previous years overall remuneration of Rs 11.12 crore even as cousin Mukesh chose to set a personal example for moderation in managerial compensation levels with a 66 per cent pay cut.        
	Last week, Ambani announced that he was slashing his remuneration from Rs 44.02 crore in 2007-08 to Rs 15 crore after corporate affairs minister Salman Khursheed exhorted companies to stop paying vulgar salaries to top managers.        
	Reliances net profit fell 21 per cent to Rs 15,309 crore in 2008-09 from Rs 19,458 crore in the previous year. As a result, Mukesh was entitled to receive Rs 43.24 crore under the remuneration formula cleared last year by the shareholders.        
	While announcing Mukesh Ambanis pay cut, the company had said that the remuneration committee would adopt a capped structure method of deciding executive compensation in RIL from now on.        
	The pay packet usually consists of three elements: salary, perks and allowances, and a commission that is linked to net profits.        
	Under the Companies Act 1956, top managers, including the managing director, can together be paid up to 10 per cent of the net profits of the company.        
	Almost none of the top companies pay commission that is anywhere close to this level.        
	In its October 15 announcement, Reliance Industries had said that the capped structure for the payment of executive compensation would replace the earlier system based on a pure percentage to the net profits of the company.        
	Curiously, this finds no mention in the latest RIL annual report.        
	The annual report for 2007-08 had said that the total commission payable to Mukesh Ambani, Nikhil and Hital Meswani would be capped at 0.402 per cent of the companys net profit.        
	In the latest annual report, it says the overall remuneration, including commission to all three of them (i.e. Mukesh and his cousins) shall not exceed 0.40 per cent of the net profits of the company.        
	It is not clear why the ordinary resolution on Hital Meswanis appointment and the explanatory statement that accompanies it fail to talk about the capped structure for executive compensation even though it took note of Ambanis pay cut which was announced on the same day.

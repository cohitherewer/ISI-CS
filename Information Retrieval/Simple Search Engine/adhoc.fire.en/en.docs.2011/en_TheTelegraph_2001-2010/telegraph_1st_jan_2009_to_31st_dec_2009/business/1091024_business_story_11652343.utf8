The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Vodafone stake churn stalled
                                                                                                               Vodafone stake churn stalled
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Oct. 23: The Foreign Investment Promotion Board (FIPB) has deferred a proposal of Max Indias Analjit Singh and former Vodafone Essar CEO Asim Ghosh to sell part of their stake in Vodafone Essar.        
	Singh and Ghosh had sought FIPBs permission to sell 49 per cent each in two investment companies  Scorpio Beverages and AG Mercantile  that indirectly hold stake in Vodafone Essar.         
	If and when the proposal gets cleared, it will entail an FDI flow of Rs 533 crore through Singhs Scorpio Beverages and Rs 329 crore through AG Mercantile owned by Ghosh.        
	The decision has been deferred as the finance ministry is of the view that the proposal can be interpreted as treaty shopping, said FIPB officials.         
	The FIPB took up the proposals at its last meeting on October 9 and is scheduled to discuss the applications again on October 30.        
	Treaty shopping occurs when investors from countries with relatively higher rates of tax use the Mauritius route for bringing money into India, taking advantage of the countrys double tax avoidance treaty with the island nation.

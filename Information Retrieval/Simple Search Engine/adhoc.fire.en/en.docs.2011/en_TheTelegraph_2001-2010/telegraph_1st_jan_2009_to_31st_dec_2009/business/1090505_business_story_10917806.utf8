The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Fiat road map for auto-cracy
                                                                                                               Fiat road map for auto-cracy

	Berlin/Milan, May 4 (Reuters): The head of Italys Fiat has outlined an interesting plan to create Europes biggest car maker but will need 5-7 billion euros in financial support from governments, Germanys economy minister said.        
	Sergio Marchionne, the Fiat chief executive, met senior officials in Berlin on Monday to present his ambitious vision of combining Fiats car business with General Motors European operations and Chrysler, with whom he sealed a partnership deal last week.        
	It is an interesting approach, without question, economy minister Karl-Theodor zu Guttenberg said after meeting Marchionne.        
	He said the German government, which is keen to save jobs at GMs Opel unit ahead of a September election, would look at the details of the plan and also consider other options.        
	All Opels final assembly plants in Germany would be safe under Marchionnes plan, said Guttenberg, but an engine and parts factory at Kaiserslautern in western Germany may be hit.        
	Opel employs about 25,000 people in Germany and also has plants in Spain, Belgium and Britain.        
	Guttenberg said Fiat was not planning on taking on new debt but that it would require some 5-7 billion euros in bridge-financing and was seeking state guarantees from around Europe.         
	Previously, Opel had said it required 3.3 billion euros ($4.37 billion) in state guarantees.        
	German Chancellor Angela Merkel has said she is open to guarantees but has made clear a decision will depend on the feasibility of Opels plans and on its finding a partner.        
	If Marchionnes plan is realised, the combined group would be the worlds second-biggest auto maker with sales of about 6-7 million vehicles a year and 80 billion euros in revenues.                                      
	Fiats shares were up 7.3 percent in Milan at about 1348 GMT while the DJ Stoxx European auto sector was up 0.9 percent.        
	The auto group spinoff has always been an option prized by the market as it brings out the stand-alone value of the auto business without the built-in discount that comes from a conglomerate like Fiat, said Serge Escude, an analyst with Cassa Lombarda.        
	Marchionne told the Financial Times that Fiat and Opel would reap synergies of 1 billion euros a year.        
	He has argued that a carmaker must make more than 5 million vehicles a year to be able to turn a profit and said last year Fiat lacked the scale needed to survive the sector crisis alone.        
	However, analysts said planned job cuts could be a stumbling block to a deal.        
	The big hurdle we can see is social cost, said Michael Tyndall, of Nomura International.Im not sure if the Italian or German governments have the appetite for the job losses a merger would entail, he said.        
	Opel labour leader Klaus Franz also sounded a cautious note.        
	We will not be hostile to anyone but we will undertake a very careful risk analysis, he told reporters at Opels Eisenach plant, adding he wanted to be sure that any partner was interested in a long-term investment.        
	Guttenberg said GM in Detroit would have to take a view on the proposed deal and he noted the German government was also looking at other options.        
	Austrian-Canadian car parts maker Magna is interested in Opel and there are other possible investors, possibly including sovereign wealth funds.

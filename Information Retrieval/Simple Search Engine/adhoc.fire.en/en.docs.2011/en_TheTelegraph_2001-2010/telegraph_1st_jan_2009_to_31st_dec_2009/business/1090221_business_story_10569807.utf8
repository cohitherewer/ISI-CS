The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Export sops on way
                                                                                                               Export sops on way
          R. SURYAMURTHY                          Relief in sight                                  
	New Delhi, Feb. 20: The government is likely to announce more sops for exporters next week, including an interest subsidy and the extension of the time frame for meeting export obligations.        
	However, higher tax refunds may not be on the cards.        
	Certain procedural issues faced by exporters are likely to be addressed by the end of this month, commerce ministry officials said.         
	They said the government might put in place simplified norms for service tax refunds but ruled out any big stimulus as the packages announced earlier were comprehensive.         
	In the interim budget, the government had extended the 2-per-cent-interest-subsidy scheme on pre-shipment and post-shipment credit in employment-intensive sectors to September 30 from March 31.        
	The relief is for firms in textiles, carpets, leather, gems and jewellery and marine products. Exporters, however, wanted the subsidy till December 2009.         
	According to the officials, raising the duty refund rates was not possible now.        
	Exporters have sought an increase in refunds  the duty drawback and duty entitlement passbook (DEPB) rates  by 3-5 per cent on all products. The textile ministry has taken up the issue with the Prime Ministers Office.        
	Duty drawback is compensation to exporters for taxes paid during production. DEPB is an import duty refund scheme.         
	A. Sakthivel, president of the Federation of Indian Export Organisations, said fresh sops would be announced this month-end.         
	The government may have a scheme for those affected by the fluctuations in the dollar.         
	After registering a handsome growth rate of over 30 per cent in the first half of the current fiscal, Indias export growth turned negative from October.

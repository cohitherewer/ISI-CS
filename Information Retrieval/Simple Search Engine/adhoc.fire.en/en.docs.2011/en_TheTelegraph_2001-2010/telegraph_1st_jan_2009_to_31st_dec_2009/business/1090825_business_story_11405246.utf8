The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | New index for IPOs
                                                                                                               New index for IPOs
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Firm tracker                                  
	Calcutta, Aug. 24: The Bombay Stock Exchange today launched an IPO index to help investors to track the value of companies for two years after their listings on the bourses.        
	The base date of the index is May 3, 2004, and the base value is 1000 points. The index today closed at 1947.54, an annual compounded return of 12.88 per cent. The broader 30-share sensex and BSE 500 yielded much higher returns of 20.57 per cent and 18.90 per cent, respectively.         
	According to a BSE statement, a robust 6.7 per cent economic growth rate for 2008-09 and hopes of a further improvement will boost the primary market. It is an appropriate time to introduce an indicator that will track primary market conditions in the Indian capital market, it said.        
	The IPO index, which comprises 48 companies, will include only new listings and no follow-on offers.        
	To be in the index, a scrip must have a minimum free-float (non-promoter holding) market capitalisation of Rs 100 crore on its first day of listing. After two years of listing, the scrip will be excluded from the index on the second Monday of the month.         
	Besides, no company will have more than 20 per cent weight.        
	Sensex strong        
	The sensex today jumped around 390 points on renewed buying by FIIs following US central bank chief Ben Bernankes remarks that economic recovery could be round the corner. The BSE 30-share barometer closed higher by 2.55 per cent, or 387.92 points, at 15628.75.

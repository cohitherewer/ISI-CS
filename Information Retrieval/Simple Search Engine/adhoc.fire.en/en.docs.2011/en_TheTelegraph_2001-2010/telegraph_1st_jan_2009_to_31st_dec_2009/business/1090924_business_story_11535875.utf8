          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Ispat chairman Pramod Mittal (left) with vice-chairman Vinod Mittal in Calcutta on Wednesday. A Telegraph picture                                  
	Calcutta, Sept. 23: Ispat Industries is scouting for a partner for its proposed pellet plant at Dolvi, Maharashtra.        
	The company wants to set up a 2-million-tonne unit at an investment of Rs 600 crore.        
	Ispat is ready to be a minority partner in the venture with a 26 per cent stake.        
	Anil Sureka, director (finance) of the company, said Ispat would follow the model of the coke oven unit, also at Dolvi, for the pellet plant.        
	Pellets are concentrated iron ore lumps used in the blast furnace for steel making.        
	In the one-million-tonne coke oven project, UK-based Stemcor has a 74 per cent stake. The plant, to come up adjacent to the existing steel plant, will cost Rs 1,100 crore. Sureka said the project would reach a financial closure by November. SBI Caps is arranging the loan.         
	Ispats cash outgo in the coke oven unit will not be more than Rs 50 crore, though its total equity contribution stands at Rs 96 crore, Sureka said. We are providing land and infrastructure. Those are being factored in as part of our equity, he said.        
	The same model will be followed for the pellet plant. The development is significant as Ispat, with its high debt, has had a chequered relationship with lenders. Its profitability has always been under pressure because of high interest, even in good times.         
	Sureka was speaking after the annual general meeting of the company. Pramod Mittal, chairman of Ispat, said both the pellet and coke oven plants would be commissioned in 2011.        
	The next generation         
	Atulya and Natasha Mittal, the son and daughter of Ispat vice-chairman Vinod Mittal, have been given executive positions in the company.        
	Natasha, 25, and Atulya, 23, have been designated vice-presidents. Pramod and Vinod Mittal are the younger brothers of Lakshmi Niwas Mittal, chairman of ArcelorMittal.

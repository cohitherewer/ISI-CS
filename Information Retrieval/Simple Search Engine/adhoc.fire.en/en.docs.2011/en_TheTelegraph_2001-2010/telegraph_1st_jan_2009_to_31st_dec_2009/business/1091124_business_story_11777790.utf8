          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Nov. 23: The cabinet committee on economic affairs is likely to take up a proposal to grant Rs 10,000 crore for an alternative communication network for the defence forces at its meeting later this week.        
	The department of telecom (DoT) has agreed to roll out the optic fibre network in lieu of spectrum vacated by the defence authorities for civilian use.         
	The release of spectrum will enable the auction for 3G mobile services slated for January 14, 2010.         
	At present, four slots of 3G spectrum can be sold in some circles, while a few others have only two or three slots because of spectrum shortage.         
	Defence has agreed to vacate around 25 megahertz by January only after part of the alternative network is laid out.         
	The telecom ministry has asked MTNL and BSNL to complete the project by December 2012, six months ahead of an earlier plan.         
	If cabinet approval is obtained by the first week of December, the DoT and the defence forces can sign a formal agreement before the deadline for inviting applications for 3G auction, officials said.        
	The DoT plans to specify the available frequency and number of slots on December 8 when it will come out with a notice inviting bid applications.         
	The government hopes to garner Rs 35,000 crore from the auction to plug its fiscal deficit.        
	In the past, the government had missed many deadlines it had set for the defence forces to vacate spectrum. The defence and communication ministries had entered into an MoU earlier this year for the release of spectrum.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Doabia at the centre of ethics debate
                                                                                                               Doabia at the centre of ethics debate
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Mumbai, July 28: Retired Justice T.S. Doabia is believed to be the senior advocate representing the petroleum ministry who has been dragged into an ethics debate that has enveloped the gas dispute between the Ambani brothers.        
	It has been brought to my attention that one of the most senior advocates of the petroleum ministry  is the same person who sent a formal complaint to Sebi in October 2007 against the Reliance Power IPO and me personally, Anil Ambani told RNRL shareholders at the annual general meeting here today.        
	Sources said Anil Ambani was referring to Justice Doabia.        
	Its a different matter that Sebi and the Supreme Court allowed the IPO to proceed, over-ruling all complaints. Media reports further suggest that some officials in the petroleum ministry had observed that the services of this learned senior advocate should not be considered due to inadequate understanding and presentation of cases before the high court but this was overruled and he still represents the petroleum ministry, added Ambani.        
	In February 2008, Abani Roy, a Rajya Sabha Member of Parliament, had written to Prime Minister Manmohan Singh saying that Justice Doabia had earlier criticised the Reliance Power IPO and that his appointment to represent the petroleum ministry in a case relating to the RIL-RNRL gas supply agreement would result in a conflict of interest.         
	Retired Justice Doabia was also in the news in August last year when he said National Thermal Power Corporation Ltd had no contract with Reliance Industries. This ran contrary to NTPCs stand on the subject.        
	The RIL-RNRL gas contract was drafted on the lines of NTPC-RIL gas sales agreement.         
	RNRL stands to get another 12 mmscmd of gas if the pact between RIL and NTPC flounders.

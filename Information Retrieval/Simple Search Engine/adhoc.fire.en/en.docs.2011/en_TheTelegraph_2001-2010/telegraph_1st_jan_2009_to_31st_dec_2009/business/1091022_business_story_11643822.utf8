	New Delhi, Oct. 21: Finance minister Pranab Mukherjee today said the fiscal stimulus measures would continue as the global economy was recovering at a slow pace.        
	The government would not exit its stimulus policy till the world economy was firm and the signals of recovery were strong.         
	While Mukherjee did not comment on interest rates, he is likely to ask PSU banks to keep the rates on retail loans low to enhance the availability of cheap credit. He is expected to meet the heads of public sector banks over the next few weeks to review their performance.

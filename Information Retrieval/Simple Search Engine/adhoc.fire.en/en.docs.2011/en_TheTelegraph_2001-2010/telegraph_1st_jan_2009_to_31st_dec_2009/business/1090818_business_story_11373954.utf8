          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Anand Sharma in New Delhi on Monday. (PTI)                                  
	New Delhi, Aug. 17: The foreign trade policy, to be unveiled next week, will focus on incentives to exporters exploring new markets and relief to labour-intensive industries hit hard by global recession.        
	We will be surely looking at market expansion because if the market is not diverse, we will not be able to respond to challenges, commerce minister Anand Sharma told reporters after meeting finance minister Pranab Mukherjee to finalise the policy.         
	The European Union accounts for 36 per cent of exports, the US, 16-17 per cent, and Japan, 15-16 per cent. These three markets together account for 68 per cent of exports, and slowdown in these economies has impacted Indian firms.         
	About 60 per cent of our traditional export markets are in recession. Our exporters will be looking to expand the markets to make sure that our exports remain competitive, he said.        
	The five-year policy will be unveiled on August 27, Sharma said.        
	The focus will be to provide relief to the labour-intensive sector and to ensure that it grows.        
	The policy will ensure that the exporting industries not only sustain themselves in these difficult times but also reach out to new geographies.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Larsen to raise $600m 
                                                                                                               Larsen to raise $600m 
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Mumbai, Oct. 8: Larsen amp; Toubro (L amp;T) is raising $600 million by privately placing shares and selling foreign currency convertible bonds to institutional investors.        
	The engineering giant plans to use the proceeds to finance its infrastructure projects.        
	L amp;T has sold $400 million of shares to qualified institutional buyers at a discount of 1 per cent to yesterdays closing share price. It is also issuing bonds worth $200 million with a five-year tenure and a 15 per cent premium on conversion.         
	We are raising growth capital so that we can look for opportunities in infrastructure  roads, ports, airports or urban infrastructure and the power sector. In most of these areas, we see an opportunity to play the role of a developer, L amp;T executive vice-president (finance) R. Shankar Raman told The Telegraph.         
	The engineering company needs capital adequacy to develop and construct infrastructure projects and raise funds before it firms up the projects where it will deploy these funds.        
	The other way is to seek business opportunities and then run helter skelter to raise funds. We chose not to do that so that we could minimise market risks at a future date, he said.        
	L amp;T expects to complete the share allotment process in the next 10 days. Since the company has not chosen to raise a very large component of funds from FCCBs, it is confident of redeeming these bonds if the investors choose not to convert them.         
	The L amp;T scrip closed 1.65 per cent lower on Thursday at Rs 1,649.80.

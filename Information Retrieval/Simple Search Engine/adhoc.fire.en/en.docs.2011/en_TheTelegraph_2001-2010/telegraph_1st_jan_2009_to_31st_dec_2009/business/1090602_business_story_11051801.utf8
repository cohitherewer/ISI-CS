          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Praful Patel (left) in New Delhi on Monday. Picture by Prem Singh                                  
	New Delhi, June 1: The Congress-led government could consider an initial public offer for the cash-strapped Air India, civil aviation minister Praful Patel today said.        
	The issue, however, will not affect the public sector character of the airline, Patel told reporters after taking over for a second term.         
	However, the public offer will depend on market conditions. If stock markets do better, the Air India IPO can be considered.         
	Air India will not lose its government character (post IPO). We will keep control. Its not privatisation nor will it be divestment.        
	The government is toying with the idea of offering small stakes of between 5 per cent and 12 per cent to the public in some PSUs. Some state entities could also offer fresh capital, which would not accrue to the government.        
	Besides Air India, BSNL, NHPC, Oil India and Rites are some other PSUs that can be taken to the market.         
	While the proceeds of the stake sales in most PSUs will accrue to the National Investment Fund, money from the sale of fresh stock in Air India will be ploughed back into the airline to expand its fleet of aircraft.        
	This is one area of intent. It (IPO) will provide the much needed liquidity and ensure accountability, the minister said.         
	Patel, however, did not give any time frame for the flotation.         
	Air India, which may suffer losses this year, has an ambitious fleet-acquisition programme running, which will see the induction of as many as 111 new aircraft till 2012 from Boeing Aircraft Company and Airbus Industrie.         
	Patel, who has independent charge of his ministry as a minister of state, said the money raised by the airline would help in its expansion plan.        
	The minister added that the government was not considering privatisation of any more airports after Delhi and Mumbai.         
	However, private companies will be encouraged to set up greenfield airports.         
	He also ruled out any more bail-out packages for airlines. The government had earlier allowed the airlines to pay their jet fuel dues in six interest free instalments.                    
	 and this was seen by many as a form of bail-out.

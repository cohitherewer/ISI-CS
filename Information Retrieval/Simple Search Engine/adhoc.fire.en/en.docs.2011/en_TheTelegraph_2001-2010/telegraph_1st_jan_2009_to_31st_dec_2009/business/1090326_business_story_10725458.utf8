          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          D-day Beckons                                  
	New Delhi, March 25: Reliance Industries is likely to sign deals with 12 fertiliser firms for the sale of gas from its KG-D6 fields later this week, officials said.        
	KG-D6 will start producing gas by month-end, and the initial volumes will meet the fuel deficit of 15 urea units run by the 12 fertiliser firms. Over 15 million metric standard cubic meters per day (mmscmd) of gas will be used by the fertiliser plants.        
	Sources said Reliance had lowered the marketing margin over and above the basic price to $0.135 per million British thermal unit (mBtu) from $0.15. The basic price is $4.2 mBtu.         
	According to the allocation norm decided by an empowered group of ministers, the first 15mmscmd of gas is for the fertiliser firms and the next 18mmscmd is for power plants. City gas projects are next in line, and their allocation is 5mmscmd.        
	Prospective buyers include Rashtriya Chemicals and Fertilisers, Nagarjuna Chemicals and Fertilisers, Iffco, Kribhco, Chambal Fertilisers, Tata Chemicals, Indo-Gulf Fertilisers and companies fed by GAILs Hazira-Vijaipur-Jagdishpur (HVJ) pipeline.        
	The KG-D6 gas will land at Kakinada in Andhra Pradesh for transportation to Bharuch in south Gujarat through a 1,386km pipeline laid by Reliance.         
	In Gujarat, Reliance will use the pipelines of Gujarat State Petronet to reach the final users and to connect to the HVJ pipeline.        
	GAIL target        
	GAIL (India) Ltd aims to increase the volume of gas it transports by 16 per cent at 94.8mmscmd in 2009-10.        
	Larger volumes of gas will be available soon especially from the east coast and we will transport a substantial quantity, GAIL chairman and managing director U.D. Choubey said.

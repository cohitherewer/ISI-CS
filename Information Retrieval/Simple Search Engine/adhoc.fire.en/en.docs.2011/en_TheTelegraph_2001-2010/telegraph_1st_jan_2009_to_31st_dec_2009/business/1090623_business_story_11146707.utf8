	Calcutta, June 22: Frito-Lay, the food division of PepsiCo India, is planning to upgrade its Sankrail factory in Bengal by 2011.        
	The company will invest Rs 110 crore over the next two years in the unit to ramp up its production capacity, depending on the market demand.         
	Frito-Lay plans to manufacture its entire range of products at Sankrail.        
	Total investment at our Sankrail factory will be Rs 250 crore by the end of 2011. We have spent Rs 140 crore so far and the fresh investment will help to ramp up the capacity across all food products, vice-president (operations) Animesh Banerjee said.         
	The company today unveiled the Aliva brand of snacks and aimed to replicate the success of Kurkure.         
	We are bullish on Aliva. This will help us capture a bigger pie in the biscuit segment, executive vice-president (marketing) Vidur Vyas said.

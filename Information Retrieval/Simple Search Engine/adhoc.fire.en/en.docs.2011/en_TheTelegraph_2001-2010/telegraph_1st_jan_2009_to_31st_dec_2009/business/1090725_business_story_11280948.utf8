The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Recession spoils RIL show
                                                                                                               Recession spoils RIL show
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                             
	Mumbai, July 24: Reliance Industries today reported an 11.5 per cent drop in first-quarter net profit at Rs 3,636 crore against Rs 4,110 crore in the year-ago period. Analysts had estimated that the Mukesh Ambani flagship would notch up a net profit of Rs 4,000 crore.        
	Reliances turnover for April-June 2009 was also a disappointment, falling nearly 22.6 per cent to Rs 33,309 crore from Rs 43,050 crore a year ago.        
	The refining business was a spoiler. Recession lowered the gross refining margin (GRM) during the quarter to $7.5 per barrel against analysts estimate of $8-8.5 per barrel. The margin in the first quarter of 2008-09 stood at $15.7 per barrel.        
	Lower GRM impacted RILs revenues from refining, which contributes nearly 65 per cent to its topline.         
	The GRM is the difference between the average value of a unit of a petroleum product and the crude oil price. For Reliance, it has been declining over the past few quarters, in line with global trends.         
	However, good margins in petrochemicals and contributions from oil and gas saved Reliance. Otherwise, the results would have been worse, an analyst said.         
	Commenting on the lower topline, Reliance said decrease in prices accounted for a 24.4 per cent reduction in revenues which was partially offset by higher volumes which accounted for 1.8 per cent growth in revenues.        
	During the period, exports were lower by 38.5 per cent at Rs 17,433 crore.         
	Holding out hope for the future, Reliance chairman Mukesh Ambani said, Timely completion with safe and stable start-up of the new SEZ refinery and the KG D6 deep-water oil and gas block are noteworthy accomplishments. These projects will not only play a significant role in shaping the future growth of RIL but also help to change the energy landscape of India and the industry globally.         
	In oil amp; gas, revenues jumped to Rs 1,864 crore from Rs 787 crore a year ago.        
	Within three months of the start of gas production at the Dhirubhai-6 field in the Krishna-Godavari basin, the output has been ramped up to around 30 million cubic metres per day. Reliance said this was one of the fastest step-up in gas production in deepwater fields, worldwide.         
	At present, natural gas from Dhirubhai 6 is being supplied to 15 fertiliser, 15 power and two steel companies.         
	In refining, the revenue came down to Rs 25,180 crore (Rs 32,587 crore), and in petrochemicals to Rs 11,540 crore (Rs 14,871 crore). However, margins improved in petrochemicals to 18 per cent against 10.6 per cent in the first quarter of last year.         
	The Reliance scrip today fell Rs 24.40, or 1.20 per cent, to Rs 2,103.75 on the Bombay Stock Exchange. The results, however, were announced after the market hours.

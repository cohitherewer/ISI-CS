          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                    
	Calcutta, Oct. 5: Trouble over land acquisition threatens to derail the countrys largest ever foreign direct investment by steel czar Lakshmi Niwas Mittal.        
	The Indian-born billionaire today hinted that ArcelorMittal may dump its $20-billion investment in Jharkhand and Orissa and look for alternative sites for the steel plants, significantly delaying the progress of the projects.        
	Four years ago, Mittal had inked an agreement with the then Arjun Munda government for a 12-million-tonne (mt) plant in Jharkhand and followed it up with a similar deal with Naveen Patnaiks government in Orissa in 2006-end.        
	Though ArcelorMittal got access to some small coal and iron ore mines, it had failed to get the requisite land for the projects.        
	During the last four years, Mittal, on several occasions, had expressed his unhappiness over the delay. However, the administration in the two states did little to change the situation, fuelling apprehension that Mittal might pull out of the projects. To add to its woes, ArcelorMittals earnings took a hit as steel demand shrunk because of recession.        
	Clearing the air, Mittal today said, ArcelorMittal has no plans to quit India. The country will drive the growth in steel demand and is an important part of ArcelorMittals long-term plans.        
	The company continues to work on its two greenfield projects in Jharkhand and Orissa. However, in the event that land acquisition continues to prove difficult, we will start to search for alternative sites in India for our greenfield projects, he said.        
	Reacting to Mittals statement, Jharkhand industries secretary N.N. Sinha said, We have not been communicated anything officially. We are concerned about Mittals plans as we value every partner.        
	Mittal wanted 11,328 acres in Orissas Keonjhar district and 8,428 acres in Jharkhands Khunti-Gumla district. It was planning to buy land directly from the owners.        
	The company has been allocated 65mt of iron ore reserves in the Kamdara-Torpa region of Jharkhand, nearly one-tenth of its 600mt demand. It received coal blocks on a sharing basis at Sereghara in Jharkhand and Rampia and Dip-side Rampia in Orissa.         
	However, land acquisition has been slow. The Jharkhand government has allocated 1,025 acres. For the rest, the government is yet to hold gram sabhas to mobilise local support. In Orissa, 8 gram sabhas have been held but land is yet to be acquired.         
	I have no information from the company. I believe land acquisition is on, Orissa chief minister Naveen Patnaik commented on the development.

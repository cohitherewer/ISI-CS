The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Airline losses to shrink next year
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Airline losses to shrink next year
                              Giovanni Bisignani in Geneva on Tuesday. (AFP)                            
	Geneva, Dec. 15 (Agencies): The global airline industry is expected to halve its net losses to $5.6 billion in 2010 from $11 billion this year, with carriers in Asia-Pacific likely to experience a dramatic improvement as they improve their financial bottomline.         
	But despite this favourable outlook, the International Air Transport Association (IATA) has predicted that tough times will continue as it revised its 2010 forecast of losses from $3.8 billion to $5.6 billion, with 14 airlines shutting shop this year.         
	The worst is likely behind us.... The worlds airlines will lose $11 billion in 2009. We are ending an annus horribilis, director-general and CEO Giovanni Bisignani said at the IATA global media briefing here today. For 2010, some key statistics are moving in the right direction.        
	The IATA has 230 members, including Cathay Pacific, Lufthansa, United Airlines and Emirates.        
	Renewed consumer confidence should increase the number of people travelling by air next year back to the 2007 peak, Bisignani said.        
	The IATA also suggested air cargo volumes would rise quickly in 2010 as businesses rush to replenish their stocks.        
	Cargo demand is rising faster than world trade as depleted inventories are rebuilt, it said in a statement. Once the inventory cycle completes, growth is expected to fall back in line with world trade.        
	Crude oil prices should reach an average of $75 per barrel in 2010, up from the $61.80 average for 2009, the IATA said.        
	As a percentage of operating costs, fuel will be 26 per cent in 2010. This is considerably lower than the 32 per cent of operating costs that fuel comprised in 2008, but twice the 13 per cent of operating costs that fuel represented in 2001-2002.        
	European carriers are on track to generate the largest losses of any region, $2.5 billion, while Asia-Pacific carriers are due to show the most dramatic improvement with losses of $700 million, according to the Geneva-based body.        
	North American airlines will see their losses shrink to $2 billion, with Latin American carriers the only profitable regional grouping.        
	Earlier this month, the IATA had said that 75 major airlines reported a combined net profit of $700 million in the third quarter, up from a $3.4 billion loss in that period in 2008.         
	The darkened IATA outlook for 2010 reflects the experiences of leading carriers and airport operators who have said they are seeing signs the worst may have passed for the global economy, though recovery could come slowly.        
	Air France-KLM this month said a more dynamic cargo sector supported signs of a slow recovery and Deutsche Lufthansa said air-freight volumes were continuing to improve.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Jindals eye Rocklands win
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Jindals eye Rocklands win
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT               MINE GAME                                      
	Calcutta, Nov. 29: Jindal Steel amp; Power Ltd (JSPL) seems to have moved ahead of its Chinese rival Meijin Energy in the race for Australias Rocklands Richfield.         
	The Aussie miner has told its shareholders that the Naveen Jindal company is expected to complete its due diligence by December 15 and conclude a preliminary agreement by the end of 2009.         
	The communication to the shareholders did not mention the Chinese offer except that it had entered the race in November following which the Jindals had raised their bid.        
	JSPL is currently carrying out a due diligence on the Australian coal producer, in which Indias Essar Group had also evinced interest.         
	The Jindals had first offered Aus $0.42 a share but raised the bid to Aus $0.50 apiece and then to Aus $0.52 to match Meijin.         
	Essar had made an offer of Aus $0.50 a share but withdrew within a few days.         
	If JSPL and Rocklands agree over the price and terms of the agreement, the sale process can move ahead in two ways: a takeover or scheme of arrangement, which is essentially a legal process.         
	In the case of a takeover, the payout to the shareholders and acquisition of shares by JSPL will be completed by February or March.         
	In a scheme of arrangement, the process will be completed by April.         
	JSPL, which has a steel mill and a power plant in Chhattisgarh and is expanding in Orissa, owns 14.9 per cent of Rocklands. The company is looking for coking coal assets abroad since there is an acute shortfall of the crucial raw material, used in steel making, in India .         
	Australia, South Africa and Indonesia are the three most sought after destinations for steel companies seeking coking coal. China, which has large deposits, rations its export, thereby dictating prices.         
	Rocklands will give JSPL entry into the Chinese market, which foreign companies find it difficult to access.         
	The Australian company has two metallurgical coke plants in China following its acquisition of China Coke and Chemicals in October 2007. These units make met coke from local coal.         
	JSPLs move for Rocklands is in line with its global expansion plan. The company has ventured into Bolivia for iron ore and is scouting for coal in Mongolia. JSPL is also one of the shortlisted bidders for Zimbabwes national steel firm Ziscosteel along with ArcelorMittal South Africa.

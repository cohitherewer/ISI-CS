The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Calcutta Port embroiled in cash row
                                                                                                               Calcutta Port embroiled in cash row
          SAMBIT SAHA                          Choppy waters                                  
	Calcutta, April 19: The Calcutta Port Trust (CPT) has charged International Seaports (Haldia) Pvt Ltd (ISPL), an operator of a berth in Haldia, of non-payment of revenue of over Rs 200 crore.        
	ISPL is a private consortium having Indias largest engineering company Larsen amp; Toubro in its ranks.        
	Senior port officials said the CPT could even terminate the contract if the private operator failed to pay up. As a first step towards getting the money, the port has invoked a bank guarantee worth Rs 10 crore provided by the consortium.         
	ISPL had dragged the port to Calcutta High Court and the Supreme Court, but to no avail. According to sources, the CPT may initiate action to recover Rs 190 crore.         
	ISPL officials could not be reached for comment.         
	In mid-2007, a report by the Comptroller and Auditor General had suggested irregularities in the revenue shared by ISPL with the Calcutta Port for berth 4A. After probing the matter, the port had firmed up a claim of over Rs 200 crore and sent notices to the consortium to recover the dues.        
	ISPL did not respond to them leaving the CPT with no alternative but to encash the bank guarantee.        
	Port officials said the inquiry was still on and the claim could be higher by Rs 50 crore.         
	At the heart of the dispute lies the interpretation of how the revenue from cargo handling at berth 4A is to be shared.        
	The CPT and ISPL had entered into an agreement to construct the berth on a built-operate-transfer basis in 2002 for 30 years. The pact mentioned that the revenue would be collected by the operator and shared with the port at the rate of 46.88 per cent in the first year going up to 61.04 per cent from the fifth year and onwards.        
	ISPL had invested Rs 125 crore to build the berth and cargo-handling facilities. Soon after ISPL won the bid for the berth, the consortium which has Precious Shipping of Thailand and SSA Asia Inc of the US as the two other partners  entered into an agreement with the Steel Authority India Ltd for coal handling at the berth.        
	According to the agreement, a copy of which is available with The Telegraph, SAIL would pay Rs 196 for every tonne of coal handled at the berth in the first year, going up to Rs 661.77 per tonne in the 30th year.        
	SAIL has been paying around Rs 250 a tonne. However, ISPL is only sharing revenue on wharfage, a component of the total tariff. At the present scale of rates, it stands at Rs 81 per tonne. Port authorities maintain that ISPL should pay the total tariff, and hence the claim of Rs 200 crore.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Coking coal prices blunt SAIL edge
                                                                                                               Coking coal prices blunt SAIL edge
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Roongta: Worried                                  
	New Delhi, Jan. 27: Steel Authority of India Ltd has reported a 56 per cent dip in net profit for the quarter ended December 31, 2008 at Rs 843 crore against Rs 1,934 crore in the same period last year.         
	Sales of the PSU fell by a fifth to 2.4 million tonnes (mt), forcing it to cut output to 3.02 mt. In the preceding quarter ended September, SAIL produced 3.5 mt.        
	SAIL CEO S.K. Roongta said, The results have to be seen in the context of a significant downturn within India as well as globally. Cost pressures were so high that they could not be neutralised.         
	Expenses rose over 15 per cent to Rs 8,111 crore from Rs 6,866 crore a year ago.         
	The profitability was primarily impacted by the rising price of coking coal, which pushed up expenditure by Rs 2,641 crore. SAIL owns iron ore mines but imports coal that is blended with low grade varieties from its own mines and other collieries.         
	The biggest factor is the very high cost of our inputs, Roongta said. Global prices of coking coal had touched $300 a tonne from $96 a year ago, and the company has tried to cut costs by reducing imports.        
	The steel maker is eyeing coal mines abroad, but has been unable to make much headway. It has formed a joint venture with other state-run firms to scout Africa, Australia and elsewhere for mines.        
	Birla Corp net        
	Birla Corporation Ltd has reported a 23.51 per cent dip in net profit for the third quarter ended December 31, 2008 at Rs 81.38 crore against Rs 106.40 crore a year ago.         
	Turnover stood at Rs 518.16 crore during the quarter compared with Rs 497.86 crore a year earlier.         
	EIH profit dips        
	Hospitality services provider EIH Ltd has posted a profit after tax of Rs 33.27 crore for the quarter ended December 31, 2008, down 54.04 per cent from the corresponding period a year ago.        
	Total income fell to Rs 257.84 crore from Rs 326.85 crore a year ago.

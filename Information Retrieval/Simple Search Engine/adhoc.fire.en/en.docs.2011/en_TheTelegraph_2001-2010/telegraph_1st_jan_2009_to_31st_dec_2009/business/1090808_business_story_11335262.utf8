                                                                                                               NHPC float gets good response
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                               
	Mumbai, Aug. 7: The initial public offer of NHPC Ltd got off to a bumper start with the issue being subscribed 3.5 times.         
	The IPO got fully subscribed within five minutes of its opening.         
	According to National Stock Exchange data, the issue received bids for 5,940,924,150 shares against 1,677,374,015 on offer.         
	A price band of Rs 30-36 per share has been fixed for the IPO. Market observers are of the view that it is likely to be priced at the higher end of the band. It is also felt that the strong response may pave way for more stake sales by the government.         
	The qualified institutional buyers bid for 5,893,180,125 shares against 981,263,799 reserved for the category. Within the segment, the bulk of the response came from domestic financial institutions who overtook foreign institutional investors.         
	The retail investors portion was not fully subscribed, with the total number of bids at 46,713,450 shares against 490,631,900 reserved for the category.         
	However, the attractive pricing of the issue and strong long-term fundamentals of NHPC are expected to boost retail participation in the coming days.         
	NHPC has executed 13 hydro electric power projects in the country.         
	At present, the company is developing 11 projects at a cost of Rs 23,010 crore. These projects will add 4,622MW to NHPCs generation capacity.                                               
	We recommend subscribe to the IPO, as we believe that the company has good long-term growth prospects, Angel Broking has said in a recent note to its clients. Many other brokerages have also advised investors to subscribe to the issue.

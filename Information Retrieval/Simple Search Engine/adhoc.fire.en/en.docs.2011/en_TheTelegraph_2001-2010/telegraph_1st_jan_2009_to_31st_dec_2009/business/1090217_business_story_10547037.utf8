The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Stocks take a beating
                                                                                                               Stocks take a beating
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                
	Mumbai, Feb. 16: Investors today dumped stocks as they were disappointed with the interim budget, which failed to offer any stimulus to industry.        
	The BSE sensex tanked more than 329 points to close at 9305.45, with all the sectoral indices finishing in the red.        
	Though expectations from the interim budget were low, market circles were hoping that Pranab Mukherjee would announce incentives for infrastructure, realty, automobile and exports  sectors that have been hit hard by the economic downturn.         
	Investors also expected the tenure of the Software Technology Park of India scheme to be extended.         
	However, Mukherjee did not come up with any such measures.         
	The rising fiscal deficit also caused concern among investors. Mukherjee forecast that the fiscal deficit could widen to 6 per cent this fiscal and 5.5 per cent next year.         
	The interim budget was a disappointment. Moreover, the outlook which the minister presented, particularly on the fiscal deficit front, was fairly gloomy, said Arun Kejriwal, director of KRIS.        
	Metal, realty, banking, capital goods, refinery and power stocks suffered heavy losses.        
	The BSE realty index ended with a loss of 4.58 per cent, with DLF and Unitech falling 2.9 per cent and 5.3 per cent, respectively.        
	Dinesh Thakkar, chairman and managing director of Angel Broking, said stocks could remain under pressure in the near term because of the upcoming general elections. Overall, global factors will dictate their movements.

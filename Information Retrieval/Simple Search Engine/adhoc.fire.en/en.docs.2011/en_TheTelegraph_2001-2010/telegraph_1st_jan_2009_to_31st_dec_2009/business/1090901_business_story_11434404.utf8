	Mumbai, Aug. 31: The Union Bank of India has lowered interest rates on new housing and auto loans as a festival offer. The bank will now offer home loans at 8.50 per cent for the first three years and at a floating rate linked to its benchmark rate from the fourth year onwards for loans up to Rs 50 lakh.         
	At present, the banks BPLR stands at 11.75 per cent. From the beginning of the fourth year, it would be 2.75 percentage point below the BPLR.

There would be no major impact on its business because of a weak monsoon, it said.

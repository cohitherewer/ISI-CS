The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | R-Com to sell part of optic fibre capacity 
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      R-Com to sell part of optic fibre capacity 
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Tactical move                                  
	Mumbai, Dec. 14: Anil Ambani-owned Reliance Communications is planning to sell a part of its optic fibre capacity on its FLAG network to global broadband users.        
	Put simply, the company plans to sell an asset within an asset while retaining ownership of the worlds largest private undersea cable.         
	The cable is made up of millions of fibre pairs and Reliance Communications is considering selling some of those to large broadband users, said sources.        
	The FLAG network  or Fibre-optic Loop Around the Globe  owned by Reliance Communications overseas arm Reliance Globalcom covers 65,000 kilometres and is integrated with the companys domestic optic fibre network.        
	FLAG also provides a delivery network connecting several parts of the globe, including the US, Europe and Asia.         
	A Reliance spokesperson declined to comment on the development.         
	Earlier in the day, there were reports that Reliance Communications was looking to sell an undersea fibre optic network and a related US business called YIPES. The latter is a California-based ethernet service provider that the company bought around two years ago. The company strongly denied such a move.         
	Reports also suggested that the sale of the fibre capacity could fetch the company around $3 billion. However, sources said the amount the sale of fibre pairs within the network would yield would be significantly lower.         
	Such a sale of fibre capacity would also bring down the operating expenditure for the company, said a source.         
	Reports suggested that Reliance Communications is in talks with Japans KDDI and the US-based AT amp;T and Verizon. Sources, however, said these were some of the worlds largest broadband users and there could be several other buyers across the globe that may be interested in buying fibre capacity within the network that would give them ownership for life.                          
	Reliance Communications acquired the FLAG network for around $200 million in 2003 and sells capacity to users such as Vodafone, Yahoo, Google, Microsoft and Citigroup.

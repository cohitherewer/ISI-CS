The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | December debacle for industry output 
                                                                                                               December debacle for industry output 
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                            
	New Delhi, Feb. 12: Indian industry shrank 2 per cent in December, stoking fears that the drop in growth could land the Congress-led government in trouble.         
	The slippage in industrial growth between October and December has resulted in up to 5 lakh job losses.         
	Economists fear that if industry continues to shrink and unemployment increases, it will compound problems for the government.        
	Industrial output fell 2 per cent in December from a growth of 8 per cent a year earlier, the second fall in three months and sharply below Novembers 2.4 per cent growth.        
	The main culprit was manufacturing which in December showed a drop of 2.5 per cent compared with a growth of 8.6 per cent in the preceding year.         
	Consumer durables led the fall with a drop of 12.8 per cent compared with a growth of 2.8 per cent in the preceding year.         
	Non-durables shrank 0.1 per cent compared with a growth of 10.3 per cent in the year-ago period.        
	The overall consumer goods sector fell 2.7 per cent compared with a growth rate of 8.7 per cent in 2007.        
	Growth in sectors such as mining plunged to 1 per cent from 5 per cent. Power growth fell to 1.6 per cent from 3.8 per cent in December 2007.        
	Finance minister Pranab Mukherjee said, We need to sustain our foreign trade, revive foreign investments and generate domestic demand to maintain our growth rates.        
	Analysts said the government would have to revise its projections that estimated industrial production to rise 4.8 per cent in 2008-09. Besides, there is a cloud over the recent GDP growth forecast of 7.1 per cent for this fiscal. The Central Statistical Organisation made the forecast.         
	It is worse than (expected). It would be difficult for the Central Statistical Organisation to meet its target. In the interim budget, I see focused stimulus for some sectors and there might be cuts in indirect tax rates. The RBI might also slash policy rates by 50-100 basis points in the coming days, D. K. Joshi, principal economist with rating agency, Crisil, said.

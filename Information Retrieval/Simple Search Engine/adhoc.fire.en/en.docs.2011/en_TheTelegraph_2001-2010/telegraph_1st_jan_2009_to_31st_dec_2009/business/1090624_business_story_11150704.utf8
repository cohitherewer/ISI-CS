The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Market trip on SAIL agenda
                                                                                                               Market trip on SAIL agenda

	New Delhi, June 23: Steel Authority of India Ltd (SAIL) is mulling a follow-on public offer to fund its ongoing expansion plan that envisages almost doubling of the PSUs capacity, according to sources.        
	The steel giant has decided to carry out its expansion programme over a longer period because of the ongoing economic slowdown, which has almost halved steel demand on an annualised basis. It had originally planned to increase capacity to 26 million tonnes (mt) by 2012 from 14mt now.         
	All options are under consideration (to fund the expansion plans), including the equity option, SAIL chairman S.K. Roongta told The Telegraph.         
	Sources in the finance ministry said the government could piggyback on SAILs public offer proposal to dilute a small part of its holding in the company.        
	The government owns 86 per cent of the company. A dilution of holding by 6-10 per cent through an offering by the company combined with a small stake sale by the government will not affect the character of the company, but can yield Rs 6,000-10,000 crore for the company and the government, officials said.         
	SAILs market capitalisation stands at Rs 72,000 crore; analysts expect it to go up considerably in the months ahead as both the stock market and domestic steel prices improve.         
	Analysts said the PSU might have to expand its equity base to maintain a stable debt-equity ratio in the wake of its massive expansion plan. In this year itself, it is investing Rs 10,000 crore, with half of the funds coming from internal resources and the rest from the market.        
	We will stick to our expansion plans but stagger it. We had prepared the expansion plans when the market was booming and growth was in double digits. Now all steel makers are phasing out their plans, Roongta said.         
	Following months of sluggish demand, steel consumption in April-May 2009 rose 6 per cent to 8.2 million tonnes.

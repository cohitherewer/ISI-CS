The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Sebi relaxes norms for IDR issue
                                                                                                               Sebi relaxes norms for IDR issue
                            
	Mumbai, June 16 (PTI): Market regulator Sebi has eased the norms on the issue of Indian depository receipts (IDRs) by firms of some countires.         
	IDRs are instruments through which foreign companies raise money in India against their equities.        
	The new norms  applicable for firms that are located in countries whose market regulators are signatories to the International Organization of Securities Commissions (IOSCO) allowed the companies issuing IDRs to follow the home country requirements, especially for provisions relating to corporate governance rules.        
	This means IDR-issuing countries may not be required to follow clause 49 of Sebis listing agreement, which requires companies to have a certain number of independent directors.         
	However, the holders of IDRs have to be treated on a par with other equity-holders.         
	The IOSCO  which is a global organisation to promote high standards in stock markets  currently has 108 members.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Govt counts cost of adverse gas verdict 
                                                                                                               Govt counts cost of adverse gas verdict 
          R. SURYAMURTHY                          In a fix                                  
	New Delhi, July 19: If the Ambani gas pact gets Supreme Court approval, power and fertiliser units built at an investment of over Rs 75,000 crore will remain idle, the government said in its special leave petition before the apex court on Saturday.        
	Besides, the exchequer will be burdened by higher fertiliser subsidies, and power units will generate less electricity in the absence of gas.        
	Seeking to declare the family pact, which has not been made public, as null and void, the petroleum ministry has stated in the leave petition that the Bombay High Court order should be stayed as it denies the use of gas to the public at large.        
	The government said it was the owner of the Krishna-Godavari gas; Mukesh Ambanis Reliance Industries Limited (RIL) was only a contractor and had no right to decide on whom to sell and at what cost.        
	According to the pact, RIL will sell 28 million standard cubic metres of gas a day (mscmd) at $2.34 per million British thermal unit (mBtu) for 17 years to Reliance Natural Resources Ltd (RNRL)  now owned by Anil Ambani  which is 44 per cent lower than the government-mandated price of $4.20 per mBtu.        
	The petition said: The private arrangement envisages distribution of natural gas among these two parties for present and future reserves in KG (Krishna-Godavari) basin as well as new discoveries in perpetuity and denying the use of this vital resources to the public at large, keeping a huge investment of around Rs 75,000 crore idle and increasing the burden of government through import of fertilisers and LPG, denying the scope for revival and de-bottlenecking of fertiliser plants as also the extension of CNG and PNG (piped natural gas) to large sections of population.        
	The government said the availability of gas in the country was expected to double in about a years time. If properly used, it will promote the industrialisation of India. In terms of the MoU, however, all the gas will be owned by the respondents (RIL and RNRL) and utilised at their discretion.        
	The petition went on to say that obviously, the pressing needs of the priority sectors... cannot be allowed to be held hostage to the benevolence and mercy of these two respondents.        
	Already, RIL is supplying 15 mscmd of gas from Krishna-Godavaris D-6 field to fertiliser firms.         
	Besides, the government has earmarked up to 18 mscmd for power plants, 3 mscmd for LPG units and 5 mscmd for the household and transport sector. The present cost of assets lying idle in the power sector because of the non-availability of gas is around Rs 36,000 crore, the petroleum ministry said.

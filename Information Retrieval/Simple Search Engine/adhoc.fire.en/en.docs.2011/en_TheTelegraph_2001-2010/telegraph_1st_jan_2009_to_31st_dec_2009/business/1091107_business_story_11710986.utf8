          A STAFF REPORTER                                            
	Calcutta, Nov. 6: Tea exports dropped 13 per cent during the first nine months of 2009 because of a shortfall in production.        
	Exports during the January-September period stood at 131.2 million kg, against 150.3 million kg a year ago, the latest statistics published by the Tea Board of India and the Indian Tea Association showed.        
	Exports took a hit as drought-like conditions impacted output.         
	India exports the CTC (crush-tear-curl) variety mainly to Egypt, Pakistan and the UK and the premium orthodox variety to Iraq, Iran and Russia.        
	Production, however, has now picked up because of improved weather conditions.         
	Output during the January-September period fell 1.4 per cent to 696.7 million kg, lower by 10 million kg over the last year.         
	In the first five months of 2009  till May  the shortfall in production was almost 13 million kg compared with the previous year.        
	Production in September was at 101.46 million kg against 107.01 million kg last year, a decline of around 6.1 million kg.         
	Production in Assam, which accounts for over half of the countrys tea output, declined in September to 55.60 million kg, but it is still more than last year in the January-September period.        
	In value terms, exports rose to Rs 1,777.04 crore in January-September 2009 from Rs 1,681.79 crore a year earlier.        
	Rising domestic consumption and a global shortfall have pushed up prices to Rs 135.42 per kg from Rs 111.93 per kg.        
	Exports had touched 196 million kg in 2008 compared with 179 million kg a year earlier.         
	The country produced 981 million kg in 2008 against 945 million kg in 2007.

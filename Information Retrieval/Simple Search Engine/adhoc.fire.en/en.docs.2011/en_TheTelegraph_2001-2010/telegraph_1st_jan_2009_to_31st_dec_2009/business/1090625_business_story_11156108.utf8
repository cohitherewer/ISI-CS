The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | State Bank loans set to turn cheaper
                                                                                                               State Bank loans set to turn cheaper
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          EASY CREDIT                                  
	Mumbai, June 24: The State Bank of India today reduced its benchmark prime lending rate (BPLR) by 50 basis points to 11.75 per cent.        
	The reduction will benefit its floating rate home loan customers whose borrowings are linked to the benchmark rate.        
	The new rates will be effective from next Monday. This is the second time that the countrys largest lender has reduced its BPLR this year. Earlier on January 1, BPLR was cut by 75 basis points.        
	The rate cut comes at a time when the Reserve Bank of India is taking a close look at the concept of BPLR. The central bank has appointed a working group to review BPLR and suggest changes to make credit pricing more transparent.        
	The RBI feels that the current system has lost its relevance because bulk of the loans to companies are below the key rate. In some cases, around 75-80 per cent of the loans are below the key rates. However, some entities such as Punjab National Bank have stopped giving credit below BPLR.        
	Chaired by Deepak Mohanty, executive director of the RBI, the working group is examining the extent of sub-BPLR lending and the huge differences in BPLRs of major banks.         
	It will also suggest a suitable benchmark for floating rate loans for retail borrowers.        
	A cut in the lending rate by the SBI, the countrys largest bank, has long been expected. Hopes of a rate cut gathered momentum after finance minister Pranab Mukherjee asked public sector banks to give loans at affordable rates. Various banks had indicated that they would lower their lending rates by 25-50 basis points.        
	SBI chairman .P. Bhatt had said that there was scope for at least a 25-basis-point cut in rates. Since April, the bank had cut interest rates on deposits of various maturities by 75-100 basis points to make way for lower lending rates.        
	Earlier this month, the SBI cut deposit rates by 25 basis points across all maturities. This was the second reduction in less than a month. In May, the bank trimmed the deposit rates by 25-50 basis points.         
	UBI move        
	Calcutta-based United Bank of India today cut its BPLR by 25 basis points to 12 per cent. It will take effect from July 1.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Aviation ambition flies high
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Aviation ambition flies high
  - Boeing Dreamliner ready for test flight                                              
	Seattle, Dec. 15 (Agencies): Boeing is set to make the first test flight of its 787 Dreamliner on Tuesday  almost two and a half years after the new, fuel-efficient plane, which is key to the companys financial future, was supposed to leave the ground.        
	The lightweight carbon and titanium plane, promising to save airlines million of dollars in fuel and maintenance costs, has been hampered by a shortage of bolts, faulty design and a two-month strike, and it still has a long way to go before it proves to be a success.        
	It (the first flight) will provide a badly needed perception that the programme is on some kind of schedule again, said Richard Aboulafia, aerospace analyst at research firm Teal Group. But its still a long way from the ultimate result.        
	Airlines like the concept of the mid-sized plane, which promises to excel at carrying 250 or so people very long distances. They have ordered 840 of the aircraft, worth about $140 billion, since the paper launch of the plane in 2004.        
	The 787 is a radical departure for Boeing: About 50 percent of the plane is made of lightweight composite materials, with large sections produced by suppliers around the globe and assembled by Boeing at Everett.        
	The plane, Boeing says, will be quieter, produce fewer emissions and use 20 per cent less fuel than comparable aircraft, while passengers will enjoy a more comfortable cabin with better air quality and larger windows.        
	But production has been delayed five times in the past three years, and the first flight has been postponed six times.        
	In the meantime, rival Airbus, a unit of Europes EADS, has been attracting buyers for its competing A350 plane, which will also be made primarily from carbon-composite materials.        
	Exactly how much profit Boeing can expect to make from the plane is uncertain. Analysts say the company has invested more than $10 billion in the project, and will have to give some sort of compensation to customers for late planes. How late the planes are, and how they will perform, will not be known until flight tests are complete.        
	At 10 am Pacific time on Tuesday  assuming good visibility and decent weather  Boeing will send the first 787 into the air for a four-hour flight from its factory 30 miles north of Seattle for a foray around the Puget Sounds and inland Washington state.        
	That will start at least nine months of airborne tests on a fleet of six 787s running around the clock, which Boeing executives say will be like running a small airline.        
	But its test pilots will push the plane well beyond limits expected in ordinary commercial flights, practising mid-air stalls, dives and steep banks, as well as seeking out extremes of heat and cold.        
	Boeing says the first 787 should be certified and delivered to Japans All Nippon Airways in the fourth quarter of next year.

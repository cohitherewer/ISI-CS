	New Delhi, Dec. 27 (PTI) The government has imposed an anti-dumping duty of up to Rs 209 per metre on the import of flax fabric, used in curtains, from China and Hong Kong to safeguard the domestic industry.        
	The directorate general of anti-dumping and allied duties has recommended the levy after concluding that the imports are taking place at very low prices and have caused material injury to the domestic industry.        
	The duty will range between Rs 206.24 and Rs 209.72 per metre and will be levied for five years. China and Hong Kong were exporting flax fabric below their normal value.        
	Anti-dumping measures ensure fair trade and are aimed at providing a level-playing field to local industry. It varies from product to product and country to country.

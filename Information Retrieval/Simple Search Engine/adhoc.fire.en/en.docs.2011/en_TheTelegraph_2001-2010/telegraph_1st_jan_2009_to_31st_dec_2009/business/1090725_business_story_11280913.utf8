The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | BJP tips for North Block makeover
                                                                                                               BJP tips for North Block makeover
          JAYANTA ROY CHOWDHURY AMP; R. SURYAMURTHY                          Singh: Off the beaten track                                  
	New Delhi, July 24: Jaswant Singh, a former finance minister and the MP from Darjeeling, today suggested a radical reform of the countrys economic policy-making institutions by clubbing the Planning Commission and the railway ministry with the finance ministry and rechristening the new entity as the ministry for economic development.        
	Singh, a senior BJP leader, said the finance minister should stop behaving like an accountant and instead apply his mind to the reality of economic management of the country.        
	The radical reform plan would diminish the importance of the annual rite of budgets  a task that Singh felt could be entrusted to a newly created department of treasury as in the United States which could oversee federal finances and deal with mundane issues such as collecting taxes.        
	Singhs biggest grouse was over the annual orgy of budget-making and the tedious exercise over the preparation of the Finance Bill that no one could read in its entirety.         
	He said the Finance Bill should be abolished and, if that couldnt be done, it ought to be broken up without spelling out what he meant by that or how it might be achieved.        
	It wasnt immediately clear why the railway ministry  the only ministry that has presented a separate budget since 1924  should be merged with the new policy-making entity.        
	Tongue firmly in cheek, Singh said he didnt wish to create a confrontation between Pranab Mukherjee and railway minister Mamata Banerjee.        
	On the face of it, Singhs suggestion makes eminent sense as it seeks to separate policy making from the grubby task of budget-making and tax collection but leading economists and North Block mandarin recoiled with horror when asked to comment on the plan.        
	If there was one omnibus ministry we would have a sort of policy dictatorship. Do we really want that, asked S.P. Gupta, who was a member of the Planning Commission when Jaswant Singh was deputy chairman of the body.         
	This is a terrible idea, said Jayati Ghosh, former Planning Commission member.        
	North Block mandarins said Singh had refused to usher in any reforms during the five years of BJP rule when he had headed both the Planning Commission and the finance ministry.         
	But there was some support for Singhs plan. P.N. Shali, a former Planning Commission adviser, said, Its actually a good idea. The railways really do not need a separate budget anymore.        
	Former Rail Board member R.C. Acharya, however, said, Merging the railways with the finance ministry and the Planning Commission will only create complication as the railways represent an industrial unit with a corporate outlook.                                            
	 The railways finances used to comprise some 70 per cent of total government finances during the British era. Defence budgets often account for more money now. quot;               
	Indias finance ministry has evolved on the back of unique problems that we face. We dont need to copy the US model to reform it, said one bureaucrat.         
	Officials said the US treasury department  which manages federal finances, collects taxes, supervises national banks advises on monetary, economic, trade and tax policy  could not serve as a model for India.        
	We need to work on ideas such as the farm loan waiver, while they have to work on reviving banks and automakers through straight doles, said one official with a snigger.                    
	Former Railway Board member R.C Acharya riposted: Merging the railways with finance ministry and the Planning Commission would only create complication as the railways represent an industrial unit with a corporate outlook and social responsibility. quot;              
	 It does not recognise the need for planning for future. For the economic development of the country, planning is important.        
	The Planning Commission at present has the broad objective of improving the standard of living in India and offering employment opportunities to all.        
	The country needs to plan for the basic infrastructure development like road, water, irrigation.(and) merging railways with the finance ministry is a revisionist idea. Why only Railways, one could merge civil aviation, surface transport, shipping and other ministries. The idea seems to be a short-sighted approach to economic development without long term vision, Ghosh added.                          
	ENDS        
	In the early years of the republic, the budget was treated as a mere statement of the governments financial accounts. However, it has since turned into an extremely complicated exercise with frequent revisions of direct and indirect taxes, subtle changes in policy and an instrument to frustrate verdicts of the courts in tax cases where the government has lost through retrospective amendments in relevant legislation.        
	The finance ministry, he said, should be reformed to develop India and not to torture the common man. He said the finance ministry had not undergone any reforms since the British era.              
	He confessed he had never read the Finance Bill when he was the finance minister in the NDA government and told finance minister Pranab Mukherjee that if he had done so, it makes you a greater man than I am.        
	Singhs suggestions would, in effect, split the five departments within the existing finance ministry. The department of economic affairs  which formulates macro-economic policies  could be mashed with the Planning Commission which once enjoyed a pre-eminent position in policy formulation during the days of centralised planning.        
	The other departments of revenue, expenditure and financial services could be bundled into the new treasury department. Singhs plan could leave the department of disinvestment  which was brought under the finance ministry in May 2004  as an orphan once again.        
	Some experts felt that the creation of an omnibus policy-making institution would spell disaster. The presence of different ministries and commissions helps keeps policy checks and balances.

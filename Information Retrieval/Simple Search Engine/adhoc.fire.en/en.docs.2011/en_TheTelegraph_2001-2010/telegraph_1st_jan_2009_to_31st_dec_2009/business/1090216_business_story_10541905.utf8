	Mumbai, Feb. 15: Medicine shops are organising themselves into retail chains to fend of competition from bigger players.         
	The plan is spearheaded by the All India Organisation of Chemists amp; Druggists (AIOCD)  the representative body of around 6 lakh traditional chemists  and is in the last phase of implementation.         
	Hundreds of model stores  their brand name and and colour code are yet to be decided  will start operating within the next three months.         
	According to J.S. Shinde, president of the AIOCD, there will be a drastic change in the new scheme of things.        
	There will be a change in the way these stores service customers. While we are emphasising on customer relationship, we have also laid out a standard operating procedure to be followed, he said.         
	Shinde said the chain would enable pharmacists operating in a fragmented environment to weather competition from the organised players.         
	According to estimates, the organised sector accounts for around three per cent of the pharmaceutical sales in the country. If we do not do anything now, the increased competition from domestic and foreign players will make the unorganised sector suffer most. This exercise is also being done for their survival, he said.         
	According to industry circles, existing players in the organised segment are drawing up aggressive expansion plans. There is a possibility of overseas retailers such as Alliance Boots entering the country in the next few years.         
	An organised chain such as Apollo Pharmacies offer round-the-clock service. In developed countries, retail pharmaceutical chains also offer value-added services such as immunisation.         
	Shinde said the industry body had set up a company  AIOCD Ltd  for the stores. The plan is to have subsidiaries in various states.

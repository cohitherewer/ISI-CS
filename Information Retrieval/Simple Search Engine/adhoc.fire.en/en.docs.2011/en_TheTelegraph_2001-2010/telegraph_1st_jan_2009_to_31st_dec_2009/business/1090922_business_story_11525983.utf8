The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Deal within deadline
                                                                                                               Deal within deadline
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Sept. 21: The cash-and-share-swap deal between Bharti Airtel and MTN is likely to be completed before the exclusivity period ends on September 30.        
	However, the merger terms may be formalised later when Indian and South African regulators clear the deal. A delinking, analysts say, is possible as the integration of strategies will take place over a longer period.        
	Sources said the agreement was as good as done as Bharti had already increased the cash component of the deal. Besides, it has agreed to remain just a financial investor in MTN.        
	The two companies are waiting for approval from the South African government. Seventy-five per cent of the shareholders of Bharti and MTN must also give their permission.        
	A merger of the two entities, immediately, will have complex legal implications. So, the companies are initially looking at a collaborative management structure, involving representations in each others boards.         
	According to the new $24-billion cash-cum-stock transaction that has been approved by both the companies, Bharti will pay $10 billion in cash to MTN shareholders against the earlier proposed $7.6 billion. Bharti will also issue 442 million new shares to MTN shareholders worth an additional $4 billion for acquiring a 49 per cent stake in the South African company. In exchange, MTN and its shareholders will get 36 per cent of Bharti for about $10 billion in cash and shares.        
	MTN minority shareholders will also have the option of a stock-and-cash or an all-cash payment, said sources.        
	Bharti and MTN have been in exclusive talks since May 25 on an alliance that will create the worlds third-biggest mobile phone company with about 200 million subscribers. It is very clear for both MTN and Bharti where their next markets are. Africa and India hold 33 per cent of the worlds population and these markets have around 40 per cent penetration allowing for a lot of opportunity, telecom analyst Romal Shetty said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Pfizer in talks to buy Wyeth for $60bn
                                                                                                               Pfizer in talks to buy Wyeth for $60bn
                              Pep PILL                            
	New York/London, Jan. 23 (Reuters): Pfizer Inc  the worlds largest drug maker by revenue  is in talks to acquire rival Wyeth in a deal that could be valued at more than $60 billion, according to the Wall Street Journal.        
	The report sent shares in Wyeth 13.5 per cent higher in Frankfurt trade on Friday  their highest since August 2007  while Pfizer fell 2.6 per cent.        
	The newspaper, citing people familiar with the matter, said on its website that the two companies had been in discussions for months and a deal was not imminent.        
	The talks are fragile given recent market volatility and weak global economic conditions and could collapse, it said.        
	Industry experts said a big acquisition by Pfizer would not be a surprise, given the huge loss of earnings it faces with the expected arrival of generic versions of its flagship cholesterol drug Lipitor in 2011.        
	Pfizer, more than anyone else in the pharmaceutical industry, is under pressure because of Lipitor coming off patent, said Chris Sterling, European head of chemicals and pharmaceuticals at KPMG in London.        
	Recent stock market turmoil has made assets attractively priced for cash-rich drug makers, prompting a number of recent deals.        
	GlaxoSmithKline agreed on Friday to buy Belgian group UCBs emerging market operations for 515 million euros ($667 million).        
	Wyeth itself has also been in talks to buy Dutch vaccine firm Crucell  a deal that might now be doubtful, sending Crucell shares tumbling 17 per cent on Friday.        
	But arguably nobody needs to move as much as Pfizer.        
	Theyve got a massive patent hole to plug and they need to start working on it right now, so there is pressure on them to do something big, a London banker said.        
	The question has been whether it would be Wyeth or Amgen or Bristol-Myers, he said.        
	Pfizer spokesman Raymond Kerins said the company did not comment on market rumours or speculation, while Wyeth could not be immediately reached for comment.        
	A Wyeth spokesperson was quoted in the journal as saying the company did not comment on marketplace rumour.         
	The journal said Pfizer would likely use a combination of cash and stock to acquire Wyeth. Details on pricing have not been worked out, it said.        
	Sales of Lipitor are already on the wane, slipping 1 per cent in the quarter, because of stiff competition from the likes of AstraZeneca Plcs Crestor.         
	Pfizers new drug to help smokers quit, a blockbuster hope called Chantix, has lost a fourth of its sales in recent months because of safety concerns.        
	Earlier this month, Pfizer CEO Jeff Kindler told the Financial Times the pharmaceuticals group was open to acquisitions.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Bharti scouts for MTN funds
                                                                                                               Bharti scouts for MTN funds
          JAYATI GHOSE                          Cash call                                   
	New Delhi, July 22: Bharti Airtel will approach six to eight banks, including ABN Amro, Deutsche Bank, Barclays and HSBC, to part-finance its $23-billion proposed merger with South Africas MTN.        
	Bharti is also in talks with domestic lenders such as ICICI Bank and the State Bank of India to secure a syndicated loan of $5-6.5 billion for the merger, banking sources said.         
	The SBI has already offered a loan of up to $1 billion to the company for 3-5 years.         
	Standard Chartered, Bharti Airtels adviser on the merger, will be co-ordinating the debt financing with various public sector and private lenders.         
	The merger deal will see both Bharti and MTN offering equity stakes and cash to each other. Bharti will have to make a net cash payment of around $4 billion to complete the deal.         
	Bharti will acquire a 49 per cent stake in MTN, which in turn, will get a 36 per cent share in the Indian firm.        
	Beyond what we have already communicated in our press note, we have no further comment to offer at the moment, said a Bharti spokesperson. The banks approached by Bharti refused to comment, citing client confidentiality.        
	In May this year, when Bharti Airtel restarted merger talks with South Africas MTN, the company said it did not anticipate that funding requirements for the deal would be onerous. Bharti, which plans to fund the deal through cash and shares, did not reveal how it expected to raise the funds.        
	Raising around $4-6 billion to acquire MTN is no big deal for Bharti as it has a healthy debt-equity ratio, investment bankers said.        
	Bharti had about $629 million in net debt as of end-March 2009. Moreover, with EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortisation) of $3 billion and a debt-equity ratio of just 0.25, the telecom player is a blue-chip bet for lenders.        
	The merger will form a telecom firm servicing several countries of Asia and Africa with combined revenues of more than $20 billion and 200 million customers. Both companies are in exclusive discussions till July 31.

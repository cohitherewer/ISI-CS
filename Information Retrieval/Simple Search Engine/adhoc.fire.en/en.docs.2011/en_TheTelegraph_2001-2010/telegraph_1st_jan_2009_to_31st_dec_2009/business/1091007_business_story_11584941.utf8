The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | String of affidavits in apex court
                                                                                                               String of affidavits in apex court
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Mumbai, Oct. 6: The warring Ambani factions today filed a fresh batch of affidavits before the Supreme Court, setting the stage for the final showdown on the contentious gas dispute with the hearing scheduled to begin on October 20.        
	Seven full-time members of Reliance Industries board filed affidavits in which they said they were not party to the memorandum of understanding (MoU) which served as the basis for the carve-up of the Reliance group in December 2005.        
	The RIL board members said they had never accepted and approved the contents of the memorandum of understanding (between Mukesh and Anil Ambani) dated June 18, 2005.        
	This is a line of argument that is very similar to the one RIL took before Bombay High Court but was rejected. The difference is that this time the affidavits have been submitted by the RIL board members and not the company.        
	They said the RIL board had approved the scheme of demerger that split up the Reliance empire but the family MoU had never been placed before them.         
	The MoU  a private document that drew the contours of the family settlement that was mediated by mother Kokilaben Ambani had set out among other things the terms for the supply of gas from the Krishna-Godavari basin to Anil Ambani-owned Reliance Natural Resources Ltd (RNRL).        
	The affidavits were filed by RIL directors Nikhil and Hital Meswani, H.S. Kohli, M.L. Bhakta, Y.P. Trivedi, D.V. Kapur and M.P. Modi. They claimed they had never seen nor read the said MoU.        
	RIL also filed an application in which it said it could not supply gas to the Anil Ambani firm as the latter did not have power plants to consume the fuel. It feared that RNRL would trade in the gas and make enormous profits.        
	RNRL is demanding 28 mmscmd of gas from RIL for 17 years at a price of $2.34 per mBtu, which is 44 per cent lower than the government-approved rate of $4.20 per mBtu.        
	Meanwhile, RNRL filed an affidavit in which it questioned the integrity of the directorate-general of hydrocabons V.K. Sibal and accused him of seeking favours from Reliance Industries.         
	Sibal was accused of approving RILs proposal to increase its capital expenditure in the KG basin from $2.4 billion to $8.8 billion without proper verification.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Greater cash need to push up borrowings
                                                                                                               Greater cash need to push up borrowings
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, March 26: The government will borrow an additional Rs 1,40,000 crore in April-September to pay for its spiralling expenses.        
	Total borrowings will be much higher at Rs 2,41,000 crore, of which Rs 1,01,000 crore will be for repayment.        
	Borrowing details were chalked out today at a meeting between the government and the RBI, which was attended by economic affairs secretary Ashok Chawla and RBI governor Duvvuri Subbarao.        
	Chawla said in the first three months (April-June), Rs 48,000 crore would be raised in each month, while in July, August and September, the government would raise Rs 32,000 crore each month.        
	He said a greater repayment obligation meant more had to be raised in the first quarter.        
	Subbarao said the government needed to pay for the economic stimulus plans. In the next year, the borrowing will be done in a manner which causes the least disruption.        
	The governments finances have deteriorated sharply in 2008-09, after making solid gains in recent years, owing to the slowing economy, large subsidies, an increase in the salaries of civil servants and a waiver of loans to small farmers.        
	Election promises by political parties could further increase government spending and widen the deficit, analysts said.        
	Interest rates have risen sharply in 2009 because of the governments borrowings, undermining the effectiveness of cuts in policy rates by the Reserve Bank of India.        
	Some analysts said the governments funding needs could further push up rates and make it harder for companies to raise funds. Chawla said that would not be the case.        
	The calendar has taken into account the requirement of the market and will not in any manner crowd out the requirement of the corporate sector, he said.

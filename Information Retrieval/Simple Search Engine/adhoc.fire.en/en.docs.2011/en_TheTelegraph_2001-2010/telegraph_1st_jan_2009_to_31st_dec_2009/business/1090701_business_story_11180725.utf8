          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                             
	Mumbai, June 30: GMR Infrastructure today withdrew its $500-million qualified institutional placement (QIP) offering.         
	The withdrawal comes at a time when a host of companies are raising funds through this route.         
	The management committee of the board of directors has decided to withdraw the QIP because of existing market conditions, GMR Infra said in a filing to the stock exchanges.         
	Though the company did not reveal details, it is learnt that the withdrawal was prompted by a lukewarm response to the offering.         
	The issue opened on Monday evening with a floor price of Rs 142 per share, but institutional buyers did not respond favourably to the offering as they felt that the price was too high. This, however, could not be confirmed from company officials.         
	Sources said that the company did not need funds immediately. GMR now has close to Rs 3,000 crore of cash in its books and its ongoing projects have already been funded.         
	Shares of GMR Infrastructure today plunged 9 per cent on the Bombay Stock Exchange to Rs 141.65.         
	Recently, many companies have come out with QIP issues and most of these are from the real estate and construction sector. Even as Unitech which met with a good response for its second QIP issue, companies like Emami, Hindustan Construction Company, HDIL, Sobha Developers, Bajaj Hindusthan have all announced similar offerings.

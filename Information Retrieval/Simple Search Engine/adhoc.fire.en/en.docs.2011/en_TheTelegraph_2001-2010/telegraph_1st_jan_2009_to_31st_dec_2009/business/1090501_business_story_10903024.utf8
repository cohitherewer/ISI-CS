The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Loop to brave hurdles
                                                                                                               Loop to brave hurdles
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                          Firm resolve                                  
	New Delhi, April 30: Loop Telecom will go ahead with the scheduled launch of GSM services, undeterred by the department of telecoms (DoT) probe into the ownership pattern of telecom firms.         
	The DoT is investigating whether the Ruia-promoted Essar group has violated existing norms with regard to its shareholding in Loop Telecom.         
	The ministry of corporate affairs has asked the DoT to examine Loop Telecoms eligibility to get a licence as it is found to have an indirect link with the Essar group, which already owns a 33 per cent stake in Vodafone-Essar.         
	The DoT will take action only after its own probe is over, officials said, adding that Loop Telecom might lose its licence if found guilty.         
	However, the Mumbai-based firm is planning to go ahead with the launch of GSM services in Tamil Nadu and Orissa next month. Operators are required to cover at least 10 per cent of a telecom circle in the first year of obtaining the licence.         
	According to licensing guidelines, no player can have more than 10 per cent equity in two companies in the same circle. The ministry is also investigating the ownership structure of Swan Telecom where Anil Ambani-owned Reliance Communications could be holding more than the stipulated 10 per cent stake.         
	The Essar group owns 33 per cent in its joint venture with Vodafone Essar through companies registered in India and Mauritius. It is, therefore, not allowed to hold more than 10 per cent in Loop Telecom.        
	On paper, Essar owns a 9.9 per cent stake indirectly in Loop Telecom through BPL Mobile (now Loop Mobile, which operates in Mumbai). Loop Telecom is a majority-owned unit of Loop Mobile.        
	The corporate affairs ministry says though the Essar group does not have a direct stake in Loop Telecom, funds from the group have been routed into the latter through other companies. It also said Loop Telecoms operations were influenced by Essar.         
	A spokesperson for Loop Telecom said, The shareholding structure of Loop Telecom had been provided to the DoT at the time of issuing a licence. The shareholding is fully compliant with relevant guidelines, and we would work with the DoT in case they need any clarification.         
	DoT officials said Swan Telecom, which got a licence in January 2008, was also on its radar for the alleged involvement of the Anil firm in its funding and shareholding.

	New Delhi, July 7: National carrier Air India will induct seven independent directors into its board and have a chief operating officer within a month.         
	The cash-strapped airline will start low-cost domestic operations to turn around in the next two years.         
	The airline announced that its contractual staff would be given salaries by July 10, while others would get it by July 14.        
	Air Indias losses mounted to Rs 5,000 crore in 2008-09, while its loan liability rose to Rs 15,000 crore. The civil aviation ministry has decided to divest a part of Air Indias public stake in the near future.        
	As part of the management rejig, several old-time directors might be asked to leave and a new chief operating officer appointed, who will report to the chairman and managing director Arvind Jadhav.        
	Air India, which is run by National Aviation Company of India Ltd, will soon advertise globally for the post, sources said.        
	In the next 30 days, you will see a major change in the top management. You are going to see a major change in the board. Some heads are going to roll. We are going to bring high quality people of great integrity and people with a proven track record in business, civil aviation minister Praful Patel said.        
	The names doing the rounds for nomination on the AI board include National Knowledge Commission chairman Sam Pitroda, Infosys mentor and chairman N.R. Narayana Murthy and TCS chairman S. Ramadorai. The sources said seven independent directors, who are to be inducted, would be of international repute.        
	Apart from revamping the board, the government would go in for partial divestment of the carrier in the near future, they said.        
	The plan was to ensure a full turnaround of the carrier in the next 24 months.

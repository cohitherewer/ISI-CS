                                                                                                               Take a long view
        All is not lost for retail investors. You can still look forward to better times but for that you need to hold on to your patience, advises Dhirendra Kumar                                            
	Its an understatement to say that the financial year that had just gone by was a momentous one. Its perhaps the kind of year that has passed into a legend. We are living through times that could shape the history of the world for years, perhaps even decades. And the drama is certainly not yet over.        
	Its often said bad times were good teachers, but thats just a clich, and, like all clichs, it has only a little bit of truth in it.         
	The great panic that has gripped the world has taught investors many lessons. However, faced with adversity, many tend to arrive at wrong conclusions, the most common being to stay away from equities.        
	Look before you leap        
	Many investment advisers these days are preaching the view that only those who can bear risk should park their money in stock markets. This means, people with big bucks, or high net worth individuals, were best suited for investments in equities, while retail investors might as well give the bourses a miss.        
	This approach is wrong. There are two ways to assess equity as an asset class. A practical approach will be to chalk out ones investment strategy based on the performance record of stocks.         
	A more philosophical approach is to look at equity investment as a way to stake out ones share in the general growth of the economy.         
	The only reason that might make one wary of equities is the thought that the future would not be better than the present. In a very basic sense, a fixed-income investor is a moneylender, while an equity investor is a business owner.        
	This argument may not go down well with those who have suffered huge losses on their equity investments.         
	All the dearly held principles of investing in equities seem to have fallen apart over the last 18 months.         
	For years, concepts like diversification and gradual exposure have been the cornerstones of financial planning. These principles seem hollow after the bloodbath on the bourses.        
	Ideas fall apart        
	A diversified portfolio has always been thought to be a safe bet. Any economic distress usually limits itself to a few sectors. While some stocks are badly bruised, the impact is less severe on most. This was the case in 2001 when technology and related sectors bore the brunt, while others were less affected.         
	This logic, however, failed to work this time. Being diversified hasnt saved investors from the crash. When an entire economy is in the doldrums, diversification isnt of much help.        
	For those who went beyond sectors and invested overseas, the losses were just as bad.        
	This is the flip side of globalisation. As the worlds economy gets more integrated, the ripples are felt everywhere. The good times were global, and so are the bad times.        
	The other strategy of investing over a long time, as in a mutual funds systematic investment plan, has also left investors bleeding.         
	Even those who have been regular with their SIPs for three to four years suffered losses.         
	So, does this suggest that we abandon these basic principles of investing?         
	Not quite.        
	Patience is key        
	Equities have their ups and downs. Investment in equities should be made over the long term. This enables investors to average out their investment cost and capture the gains inherent in the overall upward movement of stock prices.        
	The problem lies in the interpretation of what long-term means. In India, the investment climate being what it is, a period of three months is maximum that an investor is willing to hold on to his equities. But long-term investments in equities should always cover a minimum of five to seven years.         
	Only in this way can retail investors reap the advantage of investing in stock markets. Invest a good portion of the money that you wont need for a decade or so in equities. You should keep doing it year after year. If you hold your patience, you will certainly not regret your decision to invest in equities.

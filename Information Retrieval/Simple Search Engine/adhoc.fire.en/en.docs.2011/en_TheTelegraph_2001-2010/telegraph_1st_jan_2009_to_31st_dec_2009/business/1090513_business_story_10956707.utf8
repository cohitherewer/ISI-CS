          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Romesh Sobti in Calcutta on Tuesday. A Telegraph picture                                  
	Calcutta, May 12: IndusInd Bank will focus on growing its vehicle finance business and not pursue other retail loans, such as home loans or education loans, in the current financial year.         
	In 2004, the Hinduja group merged Ashok Leyland Finance with IndusInd Bank to save the ailing bank. Vehicle finance is our core business in consumer banking and we will like to focus on growing it rather than expanding our retail loan bouquet and incurring more bad debt, said Romesh Sobti, managing director and CEO of IndusInd Bank.         
	The bank is doing well with its Rs 7,200-crore loan book in the vehicle finance business that has gross non-performing assets (NPA) of Rs 179 crore.         
	Our net NPA in vehicle finance is 1.7 per cent and this is much below the industry average of 4.5 per cent, Sobti said.         
	We also have a small portfolio of home loans worth Rs 170 crore, but we dont want to increase this aggressively in the current fiscal. Well look at increasing our home loan book next year, he added.        
	In April last year, when the Romesh Sobti-led management took over, consumer banking (primarily vehicle finance) contributed 55 per cent to the banks total loan book. At the end of 2008-09, retail lending comprised 45 per cent, while 55 per cent came from corporate lending, Sobti said.        
	However, the banks vehicle finance business hardly grew in 2008-09. This was because the overall vehicle finance market was down, he said.         
	IndusInd Banks growth in advances came primarily from corporate lending. Our corporate lending increased 53 per cent during the year from Rs 5,500 crore to Rs 8,400 crore, Sobti said.

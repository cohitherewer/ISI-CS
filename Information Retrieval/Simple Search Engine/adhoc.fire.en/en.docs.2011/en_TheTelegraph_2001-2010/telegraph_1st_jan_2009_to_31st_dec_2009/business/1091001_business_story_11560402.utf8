          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Sept. 30: Tata Teleservices today entered into a 15-year tower sharing agreement with state-run Bharat Sanchar Nigam Ltd (BSNL).        
	The deal to use BSNLs infrastructure will help Tata Tele to expand its GSM network faster and at a lower cost. Tata Tele, however, declined to give the financial details of the deal. This agreement has the potential to not just speed up our network expansion and rollout process, but will also have a substantial impact in terms of reduced costs, said A.G. Rao, chief technology officer of Tata Tele. Japans NTT DoCoMo owns a 26 per cent stake in the Tata firm.        
	Under the terms of the agreement, both Tata Teleservices Ltd and Tata Teleservices (Maharashtra) Ltd (TTML) will have access to the BSNL towers in all the 22 circles in the country. BSNL has around 42,000 towers. Indus Towers, a joint venture among Bharti Airtel, Vodafone Essar and Idea Cellular, is the leader with around 100,000 towers.        
	Tata Tele is rolling out its GSM service under the Tata DoCoMo brand. In the last three months, the company has launched the service in nine circles  Tamil Nadu, Kerala, Orissa, Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, Mumbai, Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh-Chhattisgarh and Haryana.        
	Telecom service providers have been increasingly outsourcing their infrastructure requirements so that they can focus on their core competencies.

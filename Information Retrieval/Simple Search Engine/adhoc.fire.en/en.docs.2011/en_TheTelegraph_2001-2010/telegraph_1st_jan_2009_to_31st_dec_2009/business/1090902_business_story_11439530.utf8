          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                               
	Mumbai, Sept. 1: The Securities and Exchange Board of India today prohibited Austral Coke and Projects from raising money from the capital markets till further notice after irregularities of around Rs 1,000 crore came to light.         
	Austral Coke is engaged in the manufacturing and selling low ash metallurgical coke.         
	The director-general of income tax (investigation), Ahmedabad, had informed the market regulator about Austral manipulating account books.         
	The I-T authorities had carried out searches at the residential and business premises of the Austral group on June 23.         
	Bogus purchases amounting to hundreds of crores by 29 non-existent companies  floated by Ajitkumar Jindal from Calcutta  have been debited to the account books of the company.         
	Jindal, in his statement recorded under Section 133 A of the Income Tax Act, 1961, has confessed to having provided bogus bills for buying raw material and machinery for the company.         
	The purchases identified by the I-T department amount to Rs 553 crore. Besides, the company has also shown sales of around Rs 495 crore to fake companies floated by Jindal.         
	The tax authorities said the accounts were fudged to show that part of the funds raised through an initial public offering in 2008 were used to buy goods from non-existent companies.         
	I find that a serious case has been made against the company for making fictitious entries in its accounts and procuring bogus bills, D.K. Abraham, whole-time member of Sebi, said in his report.        
	He said serious observations had been made by the I-T department against the companys financials for 2006-2007, 2007-2008 and 2008-2009. Sebi has, therefore, ordered an investigation into the buying and selling of the securities of the company.         
	Taking into consideration the seriousness of the alleged manipulation in the books of accounts of the company, also being satisfied that any further issue of securities as proposed by the company will not be in the interest of the investors/shareholders Sebi as the regulator of the securities market is satisfied that it is necessary to immediately intervene to prevent further activities, which are detrimental to the interests of the shareholders and the integrity of the securities market, he said.

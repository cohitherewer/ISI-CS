The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Spectrum trading fee proposed
                                                                                                               Spectrum trading fee proposed
          JAYATI GHOSE                              
	New Delhi, Sept. 17: Telecom players keen on trading spectrum should pay a one-time fee to the telecom department, a government panel has said.        
	They should pay Rs 14 crore for trading in a single unit of spectrum in Calcutta.         
	For Delhi and Mumbai, the fee is Rs 47 crore and Rs 44 crore, respectively. The committee was set up to look into second generation (2G) spectrum allocation.        
	Levying charges on the trade of spectrum will ensure that the radiowaves reach the entity that values them the most and will be able to put this scarce resource to its most efficient and optimal use, the report of the panel, headed by Telecom Commission secretary Subodh Kumar, said.        
	The fee has to be paid to the department of telecom, which grants mobile licences. Such a fee will ensure that a mobile operator does not make a windfall gain simply by trading in a scarce commodity, the report said. At present, a licence comes bundled with 4.4MHz of GSM spectrum, the minimum amount required to launch services.        
	While spectrum, or radiowaves, may be traded in any quantity, a buyer cannot hold more than 25 per cent of spectrum available in each circle.         
	Besides, the fee should be reduced proportionately based on the number of years remaining till the expiry of the assigned spectrum. The Rs 14-crore fee in Calcutta is for 20-year spectrum.         
	Operators are facing acute spectrum shortage, especially in Delhi and Mumbai.

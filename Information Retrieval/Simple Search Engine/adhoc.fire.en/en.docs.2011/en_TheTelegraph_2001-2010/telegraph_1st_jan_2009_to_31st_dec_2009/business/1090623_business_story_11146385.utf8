	Mumbai, June 22: The Union Bank of India today brought down its benchmark prime lending rate by 25 basis points to 11.75 per cent.        
	Analysts said the move had raised hopes that other public sector banks might soon follow suit.         
	The Union Bank said the revised rate would be effective from July 1.         
	It has cut the benchmark rate by 225 basis points since September last year. The rate was last reduced to 12 per cent on April 1.         
	The new rate shall be applicable to all existing and new accounts where the floating interest rate is linked to the benchmark rate.

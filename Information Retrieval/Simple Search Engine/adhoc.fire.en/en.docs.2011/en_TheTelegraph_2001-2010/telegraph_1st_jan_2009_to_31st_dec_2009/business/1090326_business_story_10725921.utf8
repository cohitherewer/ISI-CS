                                                                                                               Novartis to up stake in Indian arm
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                            
	Mumbai, March 25: Swiss drug maker Novartis AG is making an open offer to acquire an additional 39 per cent equity of Novartis India Ltd at a price of Rs 351 per share.         
	If fully accepted, the open offer will increase Novartis holding in the Indian subsidiary to nearly 90 per cent.        
	In a communication to the stock exchanges today, Novartis said the offer would represent a total value of up to Rs 440 crore ($87 million).        
	The offer has been made at a premium of 27 per cent to the closing share price of Rs 275.60 of Novartis India on March 24, which was the last trading day prior to the announcement. It represents a premium of 35 per cent over Novartis Indias average share price during the last month.        
	The announcement of the open offer sparked a spurt in the Novartis scrip. It closed almost 20 per cent higher at Rs 330.70 on the BSE. Even at this price, the open offer represents a premium of nearly 6.13 per cent.         
	Although Novartis did not comment on whether the shares of its Indian subsidiary would be delisted, market circles were of the view that the parent was keen to do so.

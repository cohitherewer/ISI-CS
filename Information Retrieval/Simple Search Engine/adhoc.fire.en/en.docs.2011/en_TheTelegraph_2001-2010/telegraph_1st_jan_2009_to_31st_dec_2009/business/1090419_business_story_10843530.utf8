          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Pocket pinch                                  
	New Delhi, April 18: Jet Airways and Kingfisher today raised jet fuel surcharge on their domestic tickets by up to Rs 300.        
	The hike comes after state-run oil companies increased aviation turbine fuel prices by nearly 7 per cent earlier this week.         
	Jet and Kingfisher announced an identical hike of Rs 200 for distances up to 700km and Rs 300 for over 700 km, which would also be applicable on flights of their budget carriers JetLite and Kingfisher Red. The increase would be effective midnight tonight.        
	SpiceJet also said it was mulling over a hike in fuel surcharge for its flights.         
	We are also looking at increasing our fuel surcharge by Rs 200 and Rs 300 (for sectors below 700km and over 700 km, respectively) in the next few days, a SpiceJet spokesperson said.         
	However, state-run carrier Air India said it had no immediate plans to increase the fuel surcharge.         
	Airlines are faced with shrinking profit margins because of high operational costs and low passenger traffic. Analysts estimate the aviation industry to report a combined loss of over Rs 8,000 crore.        
	Naresh Goyal-owned Jet Airways is in the midst of a restructuring exercise to cut costs, which may include closing some of its sales offices in major cities.         
	Reports also suggest that around 400 Jet employees may lose jobs.        
	On April 15, state-run oil companies had raised the prices of jet fuel for the third time in a month by about 6.7 per cent.        
	Oil marketers Indian Oil, Bharat Petroleum and Hindustan Petroleum review the prices of ATF on the first of every month to bring it on a par with international rates.        
	Jet fuel makes up 40-45 per cent of an airlines operating costs. Domestic airlines complain that the price of jet fuel in the country is among the highest in the world.         
	Moreover, aviation fuels are subject to high excise and sales tax levies.         
	Many states have now started reducing duties on jet fuel to encourage airlines start new flights and offer cheaper fares on flights to or from their states.        
	A drop in air travel has added to the woes of the airlines.         
	Domestic carriers have flown 32.21 lakh passengers in March this year, a decline of around 14 per cent compared with the same period last year.

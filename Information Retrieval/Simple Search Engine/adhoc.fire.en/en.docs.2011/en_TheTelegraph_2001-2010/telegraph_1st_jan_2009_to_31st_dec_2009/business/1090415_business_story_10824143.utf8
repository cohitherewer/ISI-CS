                                                                                                               Satyam exits Euronext 
                            
	Hyderabad, April 14 (PTI): Satyam will delist its American depositary shares (ADS) from NYSE Euronext in Amsterdam because of financial and legal pressures.        
	Post delisting, the firms shares are expected to remain listed on the Bombay Stock Exchange, the National Stock Exchange and through its ADS on the NYSE in New York.        
	Board members        
	The Satyam board would be restructured once Tech Mahindra gets management control, but some government nominees would continue as directors. The new investor may acquire control of the board of Satyam to ensure a smooth transition, it is expected that at least two members of the existing Satyam board nominated by the government will continue as members of the board, Satyam said on its website.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Feeder airline to link small towns
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Feeder airline to link small towns
          JAYANTA ROY CHOWDHURY                          Bose: Going places                                   
	New Delhi Nov. 24: AirCar, the low-cost charter airline, will soon connect state capitals such as Ahmedabad and possibly Calcutta with nearby industrial and tourist hubs using 9-14 seater planes.        
	We plan to tie up with states to offer services connecting state capitals with smaller industrial hubs and tourist centres. For example, our studies indicate there is immense potential for routes such as Calcutta-Dhanbad or Ahmedabad-Bhuj if the price can be kept low, said U.K.Bose, managing director of AirCar.         
	Bose, who was CEO of Air Sahara before the airline was sold to Jet, said, You cant fly a 50-seater or a 100-seater on routes like this as there will not be enough passengers. But there are enough senior executives and owners of small firms to fill up a small aircraft. They save time and at affordable prices switch to planes from trains and roadways.        
	Bose is in talks with three states, including Gujarat, to start the services.         
	Tickets will be sold on these flights through portals.         
	The states will offer airstrips, assistance in handling and security services at the smaller towns, besides providing a captive clientele to AirCar in the form of government officials and ministers.        
	We would use economical aircraft, which do not guzzle huge amounts of jet fuel, and with low landing and other charges, we can keep overheads down.        
	AirCar hasnt made much headway in Bengal but is keen on tapping what, it feels, can be an excellent market. Calcutta-Durgapur, Calcutta-Dooars, besides links between the eastern metropolis and the steel and mining towns in Jharkhand and Orissa have huge potential.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, April 24: India wants to play an active role in the development of Turkmenistans huge natural gas reserves for meeting its fuel requirements.        
	Converting the huge reserves to exportable commercial reserves requires huge investment and application of advanced technology. India could fit into this vision, R. S. Sharma, petroleum secretary, said at an oil and gas conference in Ashgabat, the capital of Turkmenistan.        
	The proven reserves of natural gas in Turkmenistan are more than 7 trillion cubic meter (tcm), while the possible reserves can be as high as 24.6 tcm.         
	India by 2025 will be importing up to 4 million barrels of oil equivalent per day of natural gas to maintain sustainable annual economic growth of 7 per cent or more.         
	Pandey said Indian public and private companies possess the technology and have the capacity to invest in natural gas. They also have the requisite experience as they operate at the global level independently and in partnership with leading firms.         
	We would like to lay the foundation of enduring ties of co-operation with Turkmenistan in the hydrocarbon sector.

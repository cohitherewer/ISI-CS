                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Maharatna status to boost ONGC plans
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                                Power-packed      
	New Delhi, Dec. 25: Armed with new-found financial autonomy, ONGC Ltd plans to bid aggressively for a Venezuelan oil block after suffering a reverse in Iraq.        
	The maharatna status will boost our acquisition moves and help in speedy investment decisions, R.S. Sharma, chairman and managing director of ONGC, said.        
	He said the company was reworking its strategy on acquiring assets abroad as the scope of financial autonomy had increased.        
	We are redrawing the strategy to outbid the Chinese firm (CNPC) and clinch the Venezuelan block, a senior ONGC official said.        
	A CNPC-Petronas-Total alliance recently outbid a consortium of ONGC Videsh, Oil India and Turkish Petroleum Corp for the giant Halfaya field in Iraq.         
	The maharatna status empowers the boards of state-run firms to take investment decisions up to Rs 5,000 crore  against the present Rs 1,000 crore limit  without seeking government approval.        
	Both India and China are on the lookout for energy resources abroad to fuel economic growth.         
	Competition for oil will increase in the coming decades. Increasing the financial and operational autonomy of PSUs is a way of equipping them to compete aggressively, said Arvind Mahajan, executive director of KPMG.        
	Analysts said the Venezuelan block would be the first serious test for the state-owned oil and gas explorer as the government had provided it enough financial prowess to bid competitively.        
	ONGC has replaced Reliance Industries with Repsol YPF SA, Spains biggest oil company, and Malaysias Petronas to bid for the Venezuelan oil blocks next month.        
	The consortium is pitted against, among others, a CNPC-Total combine. Total is a French firm.        
	The Latin American nation is offering up to a 40 per cent stake in the three oil blocks in the Orinoco Belt.         
	The rest will be held by Venezuelas state oil company, Petroleos de Venezuela SA.        
	Venezuela is likely to announce the winners of the three blocks on January 28.

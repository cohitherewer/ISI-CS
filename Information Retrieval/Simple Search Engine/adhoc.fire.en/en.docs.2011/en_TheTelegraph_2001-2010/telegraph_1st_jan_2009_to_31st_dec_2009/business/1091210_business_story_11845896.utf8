	Calcutta, Dec. 9: The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has renewed its focus on financial inclusion to sustain economic recovery.         
	RBI governor D. Subbarao today told bankers here that the regulator would consider other models if the banks failed.         
	We have taken a few decisions to make commercial banks more responsive towards financial inclusion, Subbarao said.        
	According to the RBIs plan, the lead bank in each state will have to draw a road map by March so that all areas with a population of 2,000 or more get banking facilities.        
	Banks may not need to set up a branch but they should provide basic facilities through other means, such as business correspondents, Subbarao said.         
	According to the RBI governor, all scheduled commercial banks  foreign and private  will have to come up with inclusion strategies by March and roll out their programmes over the next three years.        
	Achievements in financial inclusion will even be taken into account while evaluating bank managers.         
	The RBI governor said though banks were opening no-frills accounts, many of these were not in use.         
	Financial inclusion is not just about opening bank accounts of financially excluded people but also to encourage them to undertake regular banking operations, Subbarao said.         
	The banking regulator has asked the convenors of state level bankers committees to open at least one financial-literacy-cum-credit-counselling centre in each district.        
	The RBI governor also took exception to the banks indifference towards giving education loan to the poor.         
	We should not underestimate the poors understanding of financial products. We should be more sensitive to what people need, Subbarao said.         
	Subbarao also urged banks to consider electronic transfer of government payments and social security benefits as profitable business opportunities.

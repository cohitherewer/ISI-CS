                                                                                                               Gold attains new glory
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                             
	Mumbai, Feb. 17: Gold prices today closed at a new peak of Rs 15,230 per 10 gram following a rally in the overseas markets and a weaker rupee.         
	In Calcutta, the precious metal closed higher at Rs 15,585, up from Rs 15,090 on Monday.         
	In Delhi, gold touched Rs 15,420 per 10 gram, zooming past all previous records.        
	International prices of gold breached $960 per ounce.        
	Various investors, including hedge funds, gold backed exchange-traded funds and even central banks, have been buying the metal.         
	Investors have concerns about the economic environment. Stocks are not doing well either. Therefore, risk-averse investors are buying gold, which has emerged as the best option, said Harish Gallipali, of Karvy Comtrade.         
	Gallipali expects the global price of the metal to touch $980 per ounce and the local price to hit Rs 15,500, shortly.         
	The steep rise in prices, however, brought gloom to retail buyers in the ongoing wedding season.         
	A jeweller in Delhi said many customers were postponing their purchases.        
	We are in the marriage season and yet people are not buying gold due to their high prices, an analyst said.        
	At the Multi-Commodity Exchange, too, gold hit a new high. Sources said the gold contract for April delivery was traded at Rs 15,300 per 10 gram.

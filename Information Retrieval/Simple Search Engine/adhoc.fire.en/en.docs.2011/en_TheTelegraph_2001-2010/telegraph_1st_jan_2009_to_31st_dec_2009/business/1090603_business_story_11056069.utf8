The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | PNB chief tipped to be RBI deputy governor
                                                                                                               PNB chief tipped to be RBI deputy governor
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                                K.C Chakrabarty:Infray      
	Mumbai, June 2: K.C. Chakrabarty, the chairman and managing director of Punjab National Bank, is likely to take over as deputy governor of the Reserve Bank of India.        
	Chakrabarty will succeed V. Leeladhar as the deputy governor in charge of banking.         
	After Leeladhars retirement last December, the government had set up a high-level committee headed by RBI governor D. Subbarao to shortlist candidates.         
	Bank of India chairman T.S. Narayanasami was also a strong contender.        
	The official notification is expected soon, and Chakrabarty is likely to assume office on Monday.        
	RBI deputy governor Rakesh Mohan had also retired last month. According to reports, Arvind Virmani, economic adviser in the ministry of finance, could step in his shoes. Shyamala Gopinath and Usha Thorat are the other deputy governors.        
	Bank guarantee ban        
	The RBI has put a blanket ban on banks guaranteeing debenture issues by corporate entities and has sought a strict compliance on its directive.        
	The apex bank is concerned that such guarantees might send wrong signals.         
	A central bank official said certain violations had been noticed recently even though an RBI directive had been in place for quite some time.         
	To make things clearer, the RBI had to again issue a notification to all commercial banks in the country in this regard, he said.        
	Days before the notification, when the apex bank said that certain banks were issuing guarantees on behalf of companies in respect of their issuance of non-convertible debentures, the State Bank of India guaranteed a Rs 4,200-crore NCD issue of Tata Motors.        
	On whether the RBI would ask the PSU bank to withdraw the guarantee, the official said the central bank would exercise regulatory forbearance.

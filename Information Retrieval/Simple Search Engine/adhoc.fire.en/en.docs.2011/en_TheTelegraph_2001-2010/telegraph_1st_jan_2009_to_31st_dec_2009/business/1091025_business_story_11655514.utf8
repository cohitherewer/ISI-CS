The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | 3G spectrum auction on January 14
                                                                                                               3G spectrum auction on January 14

	New Delhi, Oct. 24: India will begin a long-delayed auction of third-generation (3G) spectrum for mobile services on January 14, the telecom ministry said on Saturday.        
	Firms have to submit bids by December 21 for a total of 71 blocks of spectrum put up for auction across 20 of Indias 22 telecom zones, according to a memorandum to prospective bidders.        
	The auction, which will introduce high-speed Internet and video downloads on mobile phones, was originally slated for January this year but was deferred to December following differences between the telecom and finance ministries over the reserve price for the bids.        
	The finance ministry is keen to introduce a transparent system to auction both third- and second-generation telecom licences.        
	Officials said the finance ministry had wanted the auction of third-generation licences to be held by December.         
	The ministry has long felt that auction was the best price discovery mechanism for telecom licences and spectrum (scarce air waves through which mobile calls travel).         
	However, telecom minister A.Raja had earlier dragged his feet over auction seeking time till defence forces vacated spectrum.        
	The finance ministry is impatient to begin the auction process as it has budgeted to earn some Rs 35,000 crore from the sale of radio waves.        
	Ministry officials had earlier indicated they would even prefer a two-stage auction  one of spectrum available with the DoT and a second when the defence ministry finally vacates spectrum  in case there were more delays in the defence forces vacating spectrum.        
	Even if defence forces delay releasing spectrum, officials feel, the only course now left is to put in place a system that will let the highest bidders get spectrum first. Firms that bid lower can wait till the defence forces vacate spectrum, which could be as late as mid-2010.        
	However, even if auction is held this financial year, several of the domestic telecom players that have overexposed themselves in rolling out mobile circles or in acquisitions may find it difficult to garner sufficient cash to bid for the coveted 3G auctions.        
	If telecom firms also have to buy additional 2G spectrum that they will need to roll out services, it will add to their expansion costs. All telecom service providers in India currently offer services using 2G air waves.        
	At present, a telecom licence comes bundled with 4.4 MHz of GSM spectrum, which is the minimum amount of air waves required to launch mobile services. Following this, telecom firms are awarded an additional 1.8 units of 2G air waves, subject to them meeting certain pre-defined subscriber numbers.        
	Raja on norms        
	Rejecting allegations of irregularities in spectrum allocation, telecom minister A. Raja today said he had not deviated from the norms followed by his predecessors.         
	I have only followed the stipulations laid down by my predecessors and officials and have not deviated from them, Raja, who has come under attack from the Opposition over spectrum allocation, said today.

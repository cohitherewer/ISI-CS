          OUR CORRESPONDENT                                            
	New Delhi, March 5: The government has appointed former ICAI president Ved Jain and noted tax lawyer . P. Vaish to the board of Maytas Infra, following a Company Law Board directive.         
	It has also put Vaish on the board of Maytas Properties.        
	Passing its order on a ministry of corporate affairs plea to sack the board of Maytas Properties and Maytas Infra, the CLB directed the ministry to appoint four nominee directors in Maytas Infra, including the chairman, and a director in Maytas Properties.        
	Vaish today said he and the existing directors of Maytas Infra would work for the benefit of all stakeholders.        
	Our priority would be to see that all the stakeholders benefit. I do not doubt the bonafide of the present directors (of Maytas Infra). I think they would also work for the benefit of the stakeholders, Vaish said.        
	The CLB order stated that the new Maytas Infra board should give a monthly report to the government from April.         
	No government agency can initiate criminal or punitive actions against the nominee directors without the prior approval of the CLB.         
	Besides, the new Maytas Infra board cannot meet without the presence of at least two government nominees, the CLB said.         
	On Maytas Properties, the CLB said all board decisions would need an affirmative vote from the government nominee.        
	Both the firms are under government scrutiny as they are promoted by the kin of Satyam founder B. Ramalinga Raju.        
	Investigating agencies have indicated that money could have been siphoned out of Satyam and parked in these two sister firms.        
	Briefing reporters on the CLB order, corporate affairs minister P. C. Gupta today said, The government would continue to take steps as necessary to enable (Maytas companies) to function in accordance with sound corporate governance and principles in the interest of all stakeholders.        
	Meanwhile, SRS Orion, an investment firm based in Mauritius, and Infrastructure Leasing amp; Finance Services are ready to contest the CLBs order if they are not offered berths on the Maytas boards.        
	IL amp;FS holds a 38 per cent stake in the infrastructure firm, which it acquired through shares pledged by the Maytas promoters.         
	SRS Orion has reportedly invested Rs 600 crore in Maytas Properties.        
	Earlier, the CLB had said that there could be a representative from a financial institution, having a huge investment in the firm, on the Maytas Infra board.

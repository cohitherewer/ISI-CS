                                                                                                               Tatas to be soon free of Jaguar debt
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          C. Ramakrishnan in Mumbai on Monday. (Fotocorp)                                  
	Mumbai, Oct. 26: Tata Motors will shortly wipe out the last traces of debt arising from last years acquisition of Jaguar Land Rover from its books.        
	The Tatas, who had borrowed $3 billion to fund the buyout of the two British marques, still have a overhang of about $750 million after a series of cash-raising measures to repay the debt.        
	The $750 million will be repaid over the next couple of days out of the proceeds from the issue of global depository shares and convertible notes earlier this month.        
	Earlier, it had come out with a rights issue in October 2008 through which the company had raised Rs 4,200 crore.         
	It mobilised a similar amount from a flotation of long-term rupee bonds in May. It also raised around Rs 1,700 crore through stake divestments in its group companies.        
	We have repaid $3 billion through a combination of equity, divestment and internal generation. Close to $750 million will be extinguished over the next two to three days, C. Ramakrishnan, chief financial officer, said after the auto maker unveiled strong second quarter earnings that beat Street estimates.        
	For the quarter ended September 30, the car and truck maker reported a standalone net profit of Rs 729.14 crore, a 110 per cent jump over Rs 346.99 crore a year ago. Net sales grew to Rs 7,924.07 crore from Rs 7,029.33 crore last year.        
	Other income was placed at Rs 420.93 crore against Rs 429.28 crore last year. This included profit on sale of investments of Rs 369.95 crore.        
	On the strong performance during the second quarter, Tata Motors said a revival in industrial activity, improvement in liquidity coupled with the introduction of new products and variants had boosted local sales.

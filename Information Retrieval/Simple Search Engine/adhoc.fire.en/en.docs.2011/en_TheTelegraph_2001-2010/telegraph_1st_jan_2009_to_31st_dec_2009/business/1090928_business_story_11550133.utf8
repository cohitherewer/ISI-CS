          JAYATI GHOSE                          Change setting                                  
	New Delhi, Sept. 27: A spectrum crunch may force new telecom players and foreign operators to bid for select circles instead of a pan-India licence in the much-awaited third-generation (3G) cellular services auction.         
	Bidding for strategic circles will not only keep the acquisition cost low but also enable the new operators to deploy their networks quickly.        
	We are a 3G player. However, we will not go for a pan-India 3G bidding as of now, said Hilde Tonne, executive vice-president of Norway-based Telenor Group, which entered India by acquiring a 67.25 per cent stake in Unitech Wireless.        
	It has decided to focus on 2G rollouts across 22 circles in the coming weeks.         
	Telenor will be launching its service in the fourth quarter of 2009.        
	Experts believe that the other new entrants  such as Aircel, Loop, Swan and Datacom  who are keen to offer high-speed 3G services may place bids for some smaller cities.         
	The government is yet to negotiate with the defence forces to vacate radiowaves for civilian use before the 3G auction in December.         
	While a specific date on spectrum release has not been set, it has been decided that the defence forces will vacate around 5-10 MHz of 3G radiowaves before the auction takes place, an official of the department of telecom (DoT) said.        
	In May, the communications and defence ministries had signed an agreement, under which the armed forces were to immediately release 10MHz of spectrum for 3G services and 5MHz for 2G cellular services.        
	The DoT is supposed to provide an alternative optic fibre cable network for the defence forces and has sought cabinet approval for sanctioning Rs 9,970.16 crore to fund the project.         
	However, sources said the defence authorities wanted the fibre network to be in place before vacating spectrum. Besides, they have demanded priority in spectrum allocation in the border areas.        
	Without the defence spectrum, only two firms can be allocated spectrum in Delhi and Gujarat, three each in Himachal Pradesh and Uttar Pradesh (west), four each in UP (east), Assam and Jammu and Kashmir, and a single entity in Bengal.         
	The government has recently approved 3G auction in the 2.1 GHz band.         
	The telecom department will provide an information memorandum, or tender documents, containing auction guidelines and the policy details to potential bidders on September 29.

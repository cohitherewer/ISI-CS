The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Hero quits Daimler venture
                                                                                                               Hero quits Daimler venture
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                           S.K Munjal: Exit mode                                  
	New Delhi, April 15: Hero Group today pulled out of its joint venture with commercial vehicle maker Daimler, blaming the economic slowdown for the exit. The joint venture was floated to make trucks in India.         
	We are disengaging from the joint venture, but the company (joint venture) will continue to exist and run by Daimler. The reason for it (the pullout) is the current economic slowdown. We would not like to commit such a big investment in the current circumstances, said Sunil Kant Munjal, chairman of Hero Corporate Services.         
	Hero Group would like to maintain a conservative profile, Munjal said.         
	The venture, which proposed to invest Rs 4,400 crore in a plant in Chennai, will now be run independently by Daimler.         
	Daimler will buy out Heros 40 per cent stake in the venture for about Rs 105 crore.         
	Uta Leitner, spokesperson for Daimler Commercial Vehicles, confirmed the development.         
	We will take over the entire 40 per cent stake held by Hero Group for 16 million euros, Leitner said.         
	She, however, said Daimlers plans in India were on track, and the proposed plant in Chennai would start as scheduled in 2010.         
	But there might be some delays. I cannot tell how much it will be, Leitner said.         
	Last year, the two companies had formed a joint venture in which the German auto major held a 60 per cent stake, with Hero Group promoters  the Munjals  holding the rest.        
	The partners had announced an investment of Rs 4,400 crore, including the setting up of the manufacturing plant in Chennai.         
	Daimler was supposed to invest Rs 1,368 crore, while Heros contribution was to be Rs 900 crore.         
	The upcoming Chennai plant, spread over 400 acres, was to have an initial capacity of 70,000 units.         
	The joint venture had aimed to source 80 per cent of auto parts locally by 2010. Daimler already has operations in India through Mercedes Benz India which imports the Actros range of off-the-road mining trucks.

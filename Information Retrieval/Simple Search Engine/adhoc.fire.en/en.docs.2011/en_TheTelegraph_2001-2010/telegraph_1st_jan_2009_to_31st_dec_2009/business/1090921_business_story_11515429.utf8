        Plan your investments to steer clear of financial risks, says Srikumar Bondyopadhyay                                            
	Money management is certainly no fun. But if you ignore it, you may end up inviting unnecessary financial stress.        
	A proper financial planning, however boring it may be, ensures that you have sufficient money whenever you need it  be it at the time of buying a house or childrens education, daughters marriage, or after retirement. Failing to plan, as they say, is planning to fail.        
	There are two aspects to financial planning  asset allocation or distribution of an investors wealth among various asset classes to reduce the portfolio risk, and asset selection to optimise the overall return of the investment portfolio.        
	People tend to spend more time in selecting the instruments rather than deciding how much of ones investible surplus should be parked in different asset classes. It is important to keep in mind ones risk appetite and the time horizon (when one needs the money) of the investment.        
	You may be investing in equity shares, mutual funds, bank fixed deposits and PPF, all at the same time. But if you are doing it without a proper asset allocation strategy, you may end up with an investment portfolio that is either too risky or will fetch too little return to match your investment needs.         
	Asset types        
	Let us first understand the difference between the different categories of assets. Broadly, assets are of two types  physical assets, such as real estate, jewellery and paintings; and financial assets, such as equity shares, mutual funds, bank fixed deposits and government securities.         
	Unlike physical assets, financial assets are promises  to pay some specific amount (bank fixed deposits, government securities, etc), to share earnings (equities/dividend) and to provide for goods and services in exchange (cash).         
	Some instruments such as bank fixed deposits and government securities have the assurance that the promises will be kept. But in equities or equity-related instruments, promises are hard to fulfil if the economy in general and the company in particular are not doing well.         
	However, with the availability of financial derivatives whose underlying assets are physical commodities, such as gold/silver exchange traded funds, commodity mutual funds and real estate investment trusts (available in many other markets but not in India as of now), we shall concentrate only on financial assets.        
	Allocation strategy        
	Now, is there any ideal portfolio allocation strategy? Since the income, investment need, time horizon and risk appetite of each individual is different, there should not be one-size-fits-all formula. It should be tailor-made for every individual.         
	However, there are some general principles which can be followed.         
	A basic approach is to allocate 60 per cent of the total investment in equities and equity-related investments and the remaining 40 per cent in fixed-income instruments. Within this 60 per cent, one can choose a mix of large-cap, mid-cap and small-cap stocks or equity mutual funds to reduce the portfolio risk and enhance return. Similarly, one can diversify the fixed-income investment instruments under the 40 per cent limit.        
	It is often argued that such an investment portfolio may not be suitable for an aged person whose risk bearing ability is low. The ideal portfolio of an aged person should consist of more of fixed-income assets to ensure a steady income at regular intervals.        
	There is a life cycle approach to asset allocation. The basic premise is that when one is young and has just started his career, one can take more risks because the investment horizon of such an investor is quite long and stand better chances to recover losses. But as a person nears retirement, his risk taking ability gets reduced. So, while a young investor should put a larger part of his investments in high-risk/high return instruments such as equity and equity-related instruments, an older individual should gradually reduce investments in equity/equity-related investments and increase the fixed income component.         
	Age factor        
	The thumb rule for this kind of asset allocation is that 100 minus the age of the investor should be his equity investment, while the rest should be debt investments.         
	For example, a 30-year-old person should invest 70 per cent of his fund in equity/equity-related instruments. By the time he becomes 70 years old, the equity investment should come down to 30 per cent and debt investments comprise the rest.         
	Both the above approaches are dynamic since the investor should constantly rebalance his portfolio to the target level. If stock prices go up and the asset value of the equity component surpasses the threshold, some of the equity holding should be sold and reinvested in debt instruments to come back to the target asset allocation level.        
	However, you can modify the percentages according to your own risk profile and investment needs. Some ideal portfolio allocations are given in the chart. In this way, you can diversify your investments to minimise risks and maximise returns.

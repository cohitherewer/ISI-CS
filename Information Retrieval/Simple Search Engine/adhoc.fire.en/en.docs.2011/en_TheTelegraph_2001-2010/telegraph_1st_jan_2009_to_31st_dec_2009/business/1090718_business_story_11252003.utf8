The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Nano scalpers at play
                                                                                                               Nano scalpers at play
          AMIT CHAKRABORTY                              
	Calcutta, July 17: Pay a premium, drive away with a Nano. It does not matter if you havent booked one, you can still be among the early birds to own a Nano in the city.         
	A leading used-car dealer in Calcutta has already sold a base model for Rs 1.9 lakh in the grey market whereas the official price is Rs 1.54 lakh. It is not, however, clear how the dealer procured the car as Tata Motors is yet to deliver the vehicles in this part of the country.         
	While the going premium rate for the base model is nearly 25 per cent, for the air conditioned Nano LX it is 33 per cent.        
	The dealer had put in an insertion in last Sundays dailies that said, Nano first car in town, just drive away.         
	The base model was sold this week. It is yet to be registered with the regional transport authority.        
	If you are willing to pay Rs 2.40 lakh you can get an LX model next week, the dealer said. The air-conditioned model is officially priced at Rs 1.82 lakh.        
	A Tata Motors corporate relations officer from Mumbai was guarded in his comment saying the company had nothing to do with such grey market deals.        
	A Tata Motors official in the regional office said the first batch of Nano cars were on their way to the city. However, a date for the formal launch and the delivery of the vehicles are yet to be finalised.         
	The owner of KB Motors, a leading Tata Motors dealer, said the sale of Nano cars in this way was illegal as the letters clearly mentioned that the allotment was non-transferable.

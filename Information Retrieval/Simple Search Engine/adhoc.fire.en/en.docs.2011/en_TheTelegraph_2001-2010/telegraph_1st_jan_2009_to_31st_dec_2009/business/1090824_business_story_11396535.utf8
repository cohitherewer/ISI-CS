The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Same deduction
                                                                                                                 Q amp;A      Same deduction
                                I deposited Rs 50,000 in a Senior Citizen Savings Scheme with the United Bank of Indias Salt Lake branch. When I submitted my declaration of investments to the pension cell of my ex-employer, the official concerned told me that deductions under Section 80C of the Income Tax Act is permitted if the SCSS account is opened with a post office but there will be no deductions if the account is opened with a bank. Is this true?          Sreenibash Gangopadhyay, Salt Lake
                    Deduction of investment in SCSS up to Rs 1 lakh is available under Section 80C, irrespective of whether the account is opened with a post office or a bank. The directive from the income tax office didnt differentiate between a post office or a bank in this regard.                                  Age count      My date of birth is March 1, 1946. Shall I be considered a senior citizen for the purpose of income tax during the financial year 2010-11 (assessment year 2011-12)?        Pradip Chandra Roy, Calcutta
                    According to the Income Tax act, a senior citizen is a person who has attained 65 years of age or more in the previous year. The previous year here refers to the financial year immediately preceding the year of assessment. You shall be 65-years-old before March 31, 2011. So, you can claim basic exemption limit in assessment year 2011-12.                                  PAN is must      I am 67 years and my total income in the last financial year was Rs 1 lakh. I didnt need a PAN. I invested in Kisan Vikas Patra and Post Office Monthly Income Scheme. Should I get a PAN at this age? Shall there be any penalty if I dont get a PAN?        Biren Guha, Thakurpukur
                    There is a misperception among people that only taxpayers should get a PAN. The truth is that even a non-taxpayer can get a PAN. A PAN is now required not only for paying taxes, but also for any financial transactions over Rs 50,000, irrespective of whether you are a taxpayer or not. You pay taxes if you have taxable income. But you should have a PAN even if you are not a taxpayer.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                                  
	Mumbai, Oct. 17: Samvat 2066 got off to a tepid start as stocks failed to hold on to their initial gains but investors are not losing hope so fast. Despite the flat start, there was a sense of optimism among the brokers gathered at the Bombay Stock Exchange today.        
	The sensex ended with a meagre gain of 3.19 points at 17326.01. The wide-based National Stock Exchange index Nifty fell marginally 0.35 points to 5141.80.        
	However, brokers said the long-term outlook for stocks is positive, considering the fact that both the domestic and the global economies were on a revival route.        
	In the short term, though, brokers and analysts expect a correction given the fact that stocks have surged significantly in recent times.        
	The mood is very positive. There is a lot of hope in the air as the sensex has nearly doubled from last years levels... However, one must be cautious since there could be a correction in the offing, Alok Churiwala of Churiwala Securities told The Telegraph.         
	Churiwala expects the sensex to breach the historic high of over 21000, which it hit on January 8, 2008, in the next 12 months.        
	The mood this Diwali is certainly that of optimism. Last year, the mood was despondent, said Motilal Oswal of Motilal Oswal Financial Services. Oswal sees the sensex close to 20,000 by next Diwali.        
	Investors who were expecting a good start to the first day of the new year were disappointed today. After opening strong at 17452.56, the sensex hit an intra-day peak of 17493.17, a rise of over 170 points. However, profit booking coupled with the absence of foreign institutional investors pulled the index down to 17326.01, a marginal gain of 0.02 per cent.         
	Brokers said investors booked profits on the auspicious day of Diwali to mark gains in their new accounts.        
	Last year, Samvat 2065 began with a net gain of 498.52 points or 5.86 per cent.        
	On the BSE, most of the indices ended flat with gains or losses of less than a per cent. The BSE Consumer Durables index led the list of percentage gainers and it was followed by metal, IT and auto indices.        
	Sterlite Industries, Reliance Communications, Bharti Airtel and TCS were some of the key gainers of todays session. Stocks of HDFC Bank, ICICI Bank and Hindalco Industries led the losers list.         
	Calcutta show        
	The Samvat 2066 Muhurat trading of the Calcutta Stock Exchange was firm today with Orissa Minerals Development Corporation making a comeback on the bourse after 14 years.         
	The benchmark index, CSE-40, was up 28.20 points at the end of the trading session. The index opened at 7852.85 and closed at 7881.05.        
	The shares of OMDC, which resumed trading on the bourse after 1985, saw the price shooting up to Rs 27,900 a share. The scrip was last traded at Rs 3.75 apiece.        
	The stock that is listed only on the CSE shot to fame after a recent decision of the Union cabinet to give Rashtriya Ispat Nigam control of the steel ministry-administered iron ore miner.

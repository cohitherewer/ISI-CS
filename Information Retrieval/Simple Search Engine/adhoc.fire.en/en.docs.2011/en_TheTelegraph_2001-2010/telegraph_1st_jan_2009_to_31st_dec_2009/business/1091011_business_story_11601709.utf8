The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Govt mulls rider to 3G auction
                                                                                                               Govt mulls rider to 3G auction
          JAYATI GHOSE                          TOUGH CALL                                  
	New Delhi, Oct. 10: The department of telecom (DoT) is planning to insert the subject to availability clause for the allocation of third-generation spectrum.         
	The defence forces will be unable to vacate spectrum till the middle of 2010. So, the DoT wants to include a condition that of the four successful bidders in each circle, the lowest bidders will have to queue up to obtain spectrum, to be made accessible as soon as the defence vacates spectrum.        
	The auction of 3G spectrum, scheduled for December this year, is likely to be delayed by a few months as the DoT works towards solving the spectrum crunch problem.         
	The DoT plans to auction 3G spectrum rights to five telecom firms  including one slot for PSU entities BSNL and MTNL  in each circle.        
	The availability clause, which is already applicable for additional 2G spectrum, is essential as the DoT does not have enough spectrum to assign 5 megahertz (MHz) of high-speed radiowaves to all the four successful bidders in a circle.        
	The current amount of 3G radiowaves allows spectrum to be given to two players each in Delhi and Gujarat, three each in Himachal Pradesh and Uttar Pradesh (west), four players each in Uttar Pradesh (east), Assam and Jammu amp; Kashmir, while only a single firm can be accommodated in Bengal, said officials. However, there would be circles where the DoT would be able to give spectrum to all the five players.         
	Industry analysts said the latest clause may force new players and foreign operators to bid for selected circles, instead of seeking a pan-India licence. This could lower the total revenue that the government is planning to garner from the sale of high-speed radiowaves.        
	The government wants to raise around Rs 25,000 crore from the sale of both 3G and WiMax spectrum.        
	The subject to availability clause will also protect the ministry from any law suits that could be filed by operators who may lose the first-mover advantage, said analysts.        
	Officials said the DoT can allot radiowaves to five players in all the circles only if the defence ministry releases two blocks of 3G spectrum (20MHz) as agreed.         
	However, the defence ministry has said it will be able to release 20MHz of spectrum only by June 2010 after shifting to the optical fibre network being developed by BSNL.

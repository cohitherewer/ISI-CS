          OUR BUREAU                          Mittal                                  
	Mumbai, Jan. 27: Som Mittal has emerged as a likely contender for the chief executive officers position at Satyam.        
	Mittals name has cropped up after Vivek Paul, former vice-chairman of Wipro, declined the offer.        
	Mittal took over as Nasscom president last year. Earlier, he headed the services business for Hewlett Packard in Asia Pacific and Japan. He has over two decades of experience in the IT industry.        
	I have not been sounded out, he said.        
	Attempts to contact the directors of Satyam failed.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Satyam weighs hefty salary cut
                                                                                                               Satyam weighs hefty salary cut
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Tough call                                  
	Hyderabad, Feb. 20: The Satyam Computer board is meeting tomorrow amid talks of a deep salary cut of 25 per cent.        
	It is unlikely that we can survive another two months on this fat salary bill of Rs 500 crore, a senior executive said.        
	The pay-cut move comes close on the heels of CEO A. S. Murtys email to Satyam employees regarding an expenditure reduction exercise. Murty has relocated onsite support staff, put a freeze on some expenses and curbed training programmes.        
	On the agenda tomorrow are the Company Law Boards approval for an open bidding to choose a strategic investor and a Goldman Sachss report on the sell-off procedure.        
	Besides, the government nominees will deliberate on the payment of March salaries. The executive said the recent borrowings from banks and the receivables were just enough for the tainted firm to survive till April.        
	While some new appointments are likely, four to five of B. Ramalinga Rajus core team of 15 may be fired. A source said the axe might fall on Ram Mynampati, who was briefly the CEO after Raju confessed to a Rs 7,100-crore fraud on January 7. Earlier, this week senior vice-president Anil Kumar was shown the door.         
	Mynampati today submitted before the Company Law Board that he was never exposed or involved in the financial functions of the company or its cash and bank balances.        
	He said he was never part of the audit panel of Satyam. He submitted a list of his assets and requested the board to keep it in guards.        
	As the board weighs the options on the bidding, Spice Corp said it would only join the race if Satyam puts up a 51 per cent stake for sale.        
	Satyam chairman Kiran Karnik said the prospective bidders would get preliminary information on finances.        
	Irrespective of the number of suitors, we would certainly give some basic financial information to them. But if anybody is looking for a balance sheet and detailed information on the finances, it is not possible, as there is not much detail available now and the preparation of a new balance sheet will take some time, he said.        
	Yesterday, two other prospective bidders  Tech Mahindra and the Hindujas  had sought a report on the companys financial position.        
	Larsen amp; Toubro, which holds around 12 per cent in the beleaguered company, said it would decide on joining the race after studying the CLBs order.        
	The CLB had recommended that the Satyam board should prepare a bidding strategy. It allowed the company to make a preferential issue of shares and increase the authorised capital to Rs 280 crore from Rs 160 crore.        
	In the Lok Sabha today, the government ruled out compensation for investors or companies hit by the Satyam fraud. The government has no plan to provide financial assistance to the investors or the companies involved, minister of corporate affairs Prem Chand Gupta said in a written reply.

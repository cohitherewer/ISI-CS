	Mumbai, June 15: Reliance Industries tumbled on the stock exchanges today following the court ruling on the RIL gas case.        
	The RIL share crashed 7.5 per cent to end at Rs 2,180.45. The stock has the largest weightage in the sensex and the court order triggered a slide. The benchmark index plunged 362.42 points to close below 15000 at 14875.52.         
	It was the fifth biggest single-day fall for the sensex which also reacted to weak cues from the Asian and European markets and sagging global metal prices.        
	The RNRL stock surged nearly 24 per cent to finish at Rs 108.35. Shares of Reliance Power, which are also expected to gain from the court ruling, rose 4.3 per cent to Rs 200.50.        
	The price of Reliance Petroleum Ltd, which is to be merged with RIL, fell nearly 7.2 per to close at Rs 136.45.        
	Gas from the KG basin is expected to be a major revenue earner for RIL in the future. Some analysts feel RILs revenues can be crimped by Rs 3,000 crore if it is forced to supply gas to RNRL at a 44 per cent discount to the government-mandated price.        
	Angel Broking, a brokerage, cut the target price of RIL by Rs 99 to Rs 2,375 per share.

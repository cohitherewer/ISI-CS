          AMIT CHAKRABORTY                          Bale plea                                  
	Calcutta, Dec. 28 : The Bengal jute industry is hopeful that Prime Minister Manmohan Singh will help it to meet to its long standing demand for higher B. Twill bag prices.        
	The central governments Tariff Commission had made a recommendation for higher prices, but this has not been implemented.        
	The Union textile ministry has been sitting on a report submitted in June this year by the Tariff Commission (formerly the Bureau of Industrial Costs and Prices).        
	We had no access to the Prime Ministers Office, but now that Bengal chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee has taken up the issue with Singh on Sunday, we can expect something positive, said Sanjay Kajaria, chairman of the Indian Jute Mills Association (Ijma).        
	Bhattacharjee said he had urged Singh to impress upon the Union textile ministry the need to adopt a firm and long-term policy on jute to safeguard it from competition from synthetic industry and facilitate exports.        
	The government and various state agencies annually buy over 15 lakh tonnes of the B. Twill bags  special sacks used in packing rice and wheat.         
	According to the industry, the government was still following an outdated system of calculating the pricing formula for the bags causing the industry to lose over Rs 300 crore since 2001.        
	The implementation of the Tariff Commissions recommendation is also crucial to end the deadlock in the industry. The trade unions have gone on an indefinite strike since December 14 seeking implementation of the owners statutory obligations such as regularisation of provident fund and the payment of arrears. Over two lakh workers have been affected by the strike.         
	Ijma says the industry will be in a position to meet part of the demands of the unions if the government agrees to higher prices for the bags.        
	There have been five tripartite meetings so far with the unions to solve the deadlock. At these meetings, the owners insisted on implementing the Tariff Commissions recommendations on higher bag prices, which would enable them to pay more to the workers.

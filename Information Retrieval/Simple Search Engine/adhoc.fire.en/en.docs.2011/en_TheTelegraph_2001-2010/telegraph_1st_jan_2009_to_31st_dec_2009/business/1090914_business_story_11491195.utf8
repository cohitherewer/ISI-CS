The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Glam gold or sham gold
                                                                                                               Glam gold or sham gold
        The precious metal has been ruling high for sometime now. Srikumar Bondyopadhyay finds out if the magic is here to stay                                            
	In the past 12 months, the price of gold (per gram) in the domestic market has increased 42.57 per cent, touching a high of Rs 1,589.47 and a low of Rs 1,095.68 during the period. In the international markets, it rose 34.08 per cent (high at $32.31, low at $22.90).         
	If we look at the gold price movement in the last 10 years, it reveals an interesting trend. In those 10 years, gold price rose four fold from Rs 357.67 a gram to Rs 1,589.47 in the domestic market in keeping with the price movement in the international markets  from $8.20 to $32.31.        
	By any comparison, the return figures are compelling enough to consider gold investment as an integral part of ones investment portfolio.         
	Experts tracking the recent surge in gold price, particularly in the last 30 days (a rise of 7.25 per cent), expect the price of the yellow metal to touch $1,200 to $1,500 a troy ounce (one troy ounce is equal to 31.1034 gm) in the medium term.        
	There are, however, others who believe that gold will retreat to the $850-level if it cannot decisively break the $1000-mark in the coming week. The spot gold price closed at $1005.70 a troy ounce on Thursday on the New York Metal Exchange.         
	Should we buy gold?        
	Let us first look at the long-term trend in gold prices. Till 2000, gold prices declined from $12 to $8.13 per gram. Between 2000 and 2007, gold rose nearly 2.5 times to $20 a gram. In the last two years, it rose 60 per cent to $32.31 a gram.        
	In the domestic market, gold doubled between 1990 and 2000 contrary to the international market. The post-2000 trend was, however, almost similar to the global cue.         
	Gold price movement in the global markets in the last two years was marked by high volatility  between 2007 and March 2008, it rose 60 per cent to $32.31 a gram and by November 2008 it fell sharply by nearly 32 per cent to $22 to rise again to $32 by February this year and again fell by 12.5 per cent to $28 in April. From April till date, th price has gained about 15 per cent.        
	Dollar connection        
	The price of gold in the international market is determined in terms of the dollar. When the value of dollar goes down, gold price moves up.         
	The US dollar index rose steadily to 120 till 2002, while the price of gold declined. Between 2002 and 2005, the index fell sharply to 80 and we saw a sudden spurt in gold from $14 a gram to $23 by mid-2006. In 2006, there was an upward correction in the index that led to a revision in gold price to $18. From 2006 till August-September last year, the index fell to 70 and rose again to 89 early this year and then fell again to 77 in September. This volatility in the index explains the fluctuations in gold in the last two years.        
	Moreover, the production of gold is declining after it reached its peak in 2001. So demand has surpassed supply.         
	The period between 2002 and last year was one of prosperity, resulting in a higher demand for gold jewellery. The period from late 2002 till August last year was marked by inflation. This resulted in increased investment demand for the yellow metal.         
	Since the collapse of large financial institutions in the US last year, investment demand for gold perked up like never before. According to an estimate by the World Gold Council, jewellery demand for gold has receded to 43 per cent in the current year, while investment demand for gold has increased to 57 per cent.        
	It is now apprehended that the bailout packages and infusion of money by developed countries, particularly the US, will lead to inflationary pressure.         
	An increase in the supply of dollars will lead to inflation and depreciation in the exchange value of gold. This is why the price of the yellow metal has started rising again.        
	But how long...         
	People had huge investible funds in their hands which they parked in gold after the collapse of stock markets around the globe. When economic recovery begins and investors confidence is restored, they will be willing to take more risks and invest in equities. So the focus may shift from gold to equities again.        
	The question is how far the exchange value of the dollar can fall vis-a-vis other major currencies?         
	In the first half of 2008, the commodity boom was pervasive. The price of every commodity from metals and energy to grains was rising. The dollar was under pressure.         
	Then the central banks of all economies started reducing their key policy rates to arrest the economic downturn. As a result, gold price fell to a low of $680 per troy ounce by November from a high of $1,033 achieved in March 2008.         
	Though gold is considered a safe haven asset, it didnt fare well during the economic turmoil last year. However, the decline in gold investment was much less than that in any other asset class during the same period.         
	Golds appeal comes more from its monetary attribute as a perfect hedge against the dollar and inflation. Gold price has almost a perfect negative correlation with the dollar. The price of gold will vary more in tandem with the exchange value of the US dollar than demand-supply conditions.         
	The recovery in the price of gold, which is less of an industrial commodity, since November-December last year could be a short-term phenomenon given the fact that all other asset classes witnessed huge percentage decline in their prices and investors sentiments have been negative.         
	But as industrial recovery picks up leading to tightening of interest rates and increased demand for other commodities, investment demand for gold will start coming off. In other words, gold price will remain high or increase till the time the Fed keeps its interest rates low . Once it starts tightening money supply and interest rates, the dollar will start appreciating and that may lead to a fall in the price of gold.

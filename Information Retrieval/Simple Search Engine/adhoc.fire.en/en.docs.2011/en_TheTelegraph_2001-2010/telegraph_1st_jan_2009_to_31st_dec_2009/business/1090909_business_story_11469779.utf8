The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | TCG Life keen on listing
                                                                                                               TCG Life keen on listing
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Calcutta, Sept. 8: TCG Lifesciences is reviving its plans to enter the capital market with an initial public offering.        
	The Purnendu Chatterjee-owned company plans to list itself next year.         
	It had filed a prospectus with Sebi two years ago, but poor market conditions forced it to shelve the plan.        
	The company had recently acquired the laboratory information management business of the US company Life Technologies Corporation.        
	We will look at an IPO once the acquisition is absorbed, Aniruddha Lahiri, president of TCG, said.        
	The new entity will double the business of LabVantage,  the contract research arm of TCG Lifesciences  to Rs 250 crore from Rs 125 crore.        
	This strategic acquisition will strengthen TCG Lifesciences global leadership position in the laboratory informatics market and enable it to serve better with a broader range of world class products and services, Chatterjee said.         
	This would also facilitate LabVantages growth in the forensics and human identification markets.        
	The company declined to disclose the value of the deal, which was financed by Axis Bank. TCG Lifesciences has its headquarters in Calcutta, where it started operations almost a decade back.         
	If the company comes out with an IPO, it will be the first from the TCG stable to go public. Chatterjee is well known for his contribution in building Haldia Petrochemicals.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          TACTical move                                  
	New Delhi, Nov. 11: Air India is leasing out 10 aircraft to prune costs as its board announced a net loss of Rs 5,548.26 crore for 2008-09.         
	The airline has asked management firm Booz amp; Allen to suggest cost-cutting measures.         
	Indias national carrier today put three Boeing 747s up for wet lease. A few days ago, it had put up three Boeing 777s and four Airbus cargo planes up for dry lease.         
	In a wet lease, an airline gives for hire the aircraft as well as the pilots and cabin crew. In a dry lease, only the aircraft is given for hire.        
	Todays board meeting at Chennai, which was supposed to take a stand on incentives to staff, including pilots, decided to defer a decision and, instead, got an outside agency to advise on cutting costs.         
	Air Indias pilots have already gone on strike in September over cuts in incentives and have threatened another stir.         
	Officials said loss-making flights, both domestic and international, would be stopped, or their frequencies curtailed.        
	Besides loss-making offices in places where Air India did not operate flights could be shut down and agents appointed.         
	Other factors which contributed to the huge losses were a steep hike in jet fuel prices, rise in interest payments and higher depreciation costs because of new plane purchases.         
	Revenues declined from Rs 15,252 crore in 2007-08 to Rs 13,479 crore in 2008-09, which the airline blamed on global recession, fall in load factors and passenger yields.         
	The airline is seeking a government guarantee to retire high-cost debts.

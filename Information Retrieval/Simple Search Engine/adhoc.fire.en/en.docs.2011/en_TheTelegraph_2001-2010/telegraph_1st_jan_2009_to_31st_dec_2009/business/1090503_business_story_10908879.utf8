                                                                                                               Exports set to look up
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          On the rise                                  
	New Delhi, May 2: Indias exports are likely to pick up in the second quarter of this fiscal  after a dismal 33 per cent dip in March  with orders from buyers picking up and the new foreign trade policy expected to provide some incentives.        
	As merchandise exports had been hit hard by the global slowdown, commerce ministry officials felt services exports, where the country has an edge, would get extra attention.         
	The foreign trade policy for 2009-14 will focus on export of education and legal services, apart from information technology, tourism, hospitality and medical services.        
	India is also eyeing the market in China, by shifting the focus from export of raw materials to products.        
	For the fiscal ended 2008-09, the country logged a marginal export growth of 3.4 per cent at $168.7 billion.         
	Exports account for nearly 16 per cent of Indias gross domestic product. The revised target for 2008-09 was $170 billion.         
	Demand from the recession-hit US and Europe fell drastically during the last financial year. In 2007-08, exports grew over 25 per cent to $162 billion.        
	Imports were up 14.3 per cent to $287.8 billion in 2008-09. This resulted in the widening of the trade deficit by 34 per cent to $119 billion in 2008-09, from $88.5 billion in the previous year.         
	Indian exports may touch $185 billion in 2009-10 with a 10 per cent increase over the last year. We have passed through the worst phase and exports will pick up from July onward, A. Sakthivel, president of FIEO, said.        
	Diversification of Indian exports to Latin America, Africa and Asia will help India to post better export figures, he said.

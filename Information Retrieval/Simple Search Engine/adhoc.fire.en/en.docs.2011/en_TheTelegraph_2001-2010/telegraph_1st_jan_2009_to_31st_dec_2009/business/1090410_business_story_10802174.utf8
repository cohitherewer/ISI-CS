                                                                                                               SBI cuts deposit rates
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                           Trim tale                                  
	Mumbai, April 9: The State Bank of India today reduced deposit rates by 25-50 basis points, a stepping stone to lower lending rates.         
	Private sector IDBI Bank went a step further and reduced its benchmark prime lending rate by half a percentage point to 13 per cent. IDBI Bank also cut deposit rates on certain slabs by 25-50 basis points.         
	Indian Banks Association chief T.S. Narayanasami had said only yesterday that nationalised banks were game for cheaper loans but deposit rates had to be cut first.        
	SBIs revised deposit rates will be effective from April 13. Interest rates on deposits of 15-45 days will be reduced to 4 per cent from 4.25 per cent, while that of 46-90 days will stand at 5 per cent (5.25) and 91-180 days at 6.25 per cent (6.50 per cent).         
	Indias No. 1 bank had last cut deposit rates in March by 40-50 basis points.         
	Interest rates on deposits in the maturity bucket of 181 days to less than a year will now be 7 per cent against 7.25 per cent earlier; for one year to less than two years, the rate will be revised to 7.75 per cent (8.10).         
	Interest on deposits of two years to less than 1,000 days will be 8 per cent (8.25); 1,000 days at 8.25 per cent (8.50); 1,001 days to less than three years at 8 per cent (8.25); three years to less than five years at 8 per cent (8.50).         
	The bank will now offer an interest rate of 8.25 per cent on deposits of five years to less than eight years compared with 8.50 per cent earlier.         
	Observers feel the deposit rate cuts can be a precursor to the SBI bringing down its lending rates. For lending rates to be lowered, a banks cost of funds must also come down, and the SBI is doing just that, sources said.         
	Experts feel there is enough room for the SBI to bring down its lending rates. The bank had last reduced its benchmark lending rate in January by 75 basis points to 12.25 per cent. The PLR of Punjab National Bank is lower at 11.50 per cent         
	IDBI Bank has lowered deposit rates in the maturity buckets of 15-45 days, 46-90 days, six months to one year, one year to three years and 1,100 days.         
	Meanwhile, industry representatives today asked the Reserve Bank to impress upon banks to lower their lending rates.         
	In a meeting with RBI governor D. Subbarao ahead of the credit policy, they said while the policy rates had been brought down, the same was not reflected in the lending rates.

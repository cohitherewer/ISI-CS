The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | RBI offers rate solace
                                                                                                               RBI offers rate solace
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Mumbai, Jan. 2: Home loan borrowers can soon look forward to another reduction in their equated monthly instalments (EMIs).         
	The Reserve Bank of India today cut the cash reserve ratio (CRR) by 50 basis points to 5 per cent, the reverse repo rate and the repo rate by 100 basis points each to 4 per cent and 5.5 per cent, respectively.        
	CRR is that portion of bank deposits that must be maintained with the RBI. The repo is the rate at which the central bank provides liquidity to banks against securities. The reverse repo is the rate at which it absorbs liquidity.        
	The half a percentage point reduction in CRR will release close to Rs 20,000 crore of funds into the system.        
	Several nationalised banks recently brought down their prime lending rates (PLRs) by around 150 basis points. Some of these banks are expected to trim their PLRs again. Interest rates on floating rate home loans are linked to this benchmark rate and any change here should result in lower EMIs for existing borrowers.Bank deposit rates are also expected to fall.         
	Customers of private sector banks can also expect a cut in rates. Pressure will now build on big players such as ICICI Bank to bring down their lending rates. These measures would accelerate the move to a lower interest rate regime across the system. We could expect a bottoming out of government bond rates and a further decline in deposit and lending rates from the current levels, Chanda Kochhar, joint managing director and CFO at ICICI Bank, said after the RBI announced its measures.        
	Banks get into action        
	Taking a cue from the RBI, the Union Bank today reduced its deposit rates by up to 1.35 per cent across various tenures effective from January 5, while Calcutta-based Allahabad Bank slashed its benchmark prime lending rate by 75 basis points to 12.5 per cent effective from next week.         
	The Union Banks one year 90-day deposits will now attract an 8 per cent rate against 8.75 per cent earlier.

                                I am 72-years-old. I have earned an interest income of Rs 25,000 from all my savings bank account. Do I have to take this into account while computing my total annual income for tax purposes? In the financial year, my total income from pension, interest on fixed deposits and savings bank account will be Rs 4 lakh. Can I submit Form 15H to banks for non-deduction of tax at source on interest income?          Narendra Lal Kundu, Hooghly
                    Yes. You shall have to include your interest income from savings bank account while computing the total annual income. Since your total annual income will be Rs 4 lakh, which is higher than the basic exemption limit for senior citizens, you cannot submit Form 15H for non-deduction of tax at source. You shall also have to file income tax return wherein you can claim refund of any excess tax paid.                                   Tax tally      I am a pensioner. My basic pension after commutation is Rs 19,307 per month. In addition, I get dearness relief of Rs 3,577 per month. What will be my tax liability?        B. Prakash, Burdwan
                    Your total pension income in a year is Rs 2,74,608, which is higher than the basic exemption limit for senior citizens. So, you have to pay tax at the rate of 10 per cent on income in excess of Rs 2.40 lakh. The dearness allowance is taxable.                                  Gift for daughter      I want to gift Rs 4 lakh to my married daughter for purchasing a flat for herself. Is it mandatory to prepare a gift deed on a stamp paper? If yes, what would be the value of the stamp paper? Are witnesses necessary for the deed? Is it mandatory to register that deed?        Basudeb Sarkar, Konnagar
                    No documentation is generally required for gifts being exchanged between close relatives as referred to under the income tax law. It is, however, advisable to make notes as they may be required at the time of assessment. No gift deed is as such required unless the sum involved is substantial. The act of gift can be noted on a plain paper with the declaration of the donee asking for and the donor giving it.

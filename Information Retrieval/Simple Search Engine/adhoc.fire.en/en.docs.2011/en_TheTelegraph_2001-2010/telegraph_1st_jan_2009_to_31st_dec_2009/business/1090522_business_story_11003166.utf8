                                                                                                               Calcutta misses GoAir flight
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Calcutta, May 21: Private carrier GoAir has entered the east, but gave Calcutta the slip.        
	The airline, launched by the Wadia family that owns Bombay Dyeing, will connect Bagdogra in north Bengal and Guwahati in Assam with Mumbai and Delhi.         
	We do not have plans to come to Calcutta in the near future. The city is well-serviced by other airlines, A. K. Sachdeva, chief operations officer of GoAir, said.         
	He said the airline was very meticulous about choosing its route and did not want to overstretch itself.        
	Passenger footfall at the airport in Calcutta has dropped 6 per cent in 2008-09 over the previous fiscal. While some of the airlines reduced frequency, a few stopped flying to the city.        
	According to an airport official, footfall in 2008-09 stood at 7.5 million against 7 million in 2007-08. However, April onwards, we are experiencing a positive trend, he said.        
	GoAir touches 13 destinations with seven aircraft. It will induct the eighth one in the next two weeks. The company will focus on increasing frequency in existing routes instead of adding new ones.

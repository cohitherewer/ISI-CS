          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                            
	Mumbai, March 31: Drug maker Wockhardt has decided to restructure debts and delayed the announcement of its annual results, while managing director Habil Khorakiwala has quit.        
	In a notice to the Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) today, the Rs 2,600-crore Wockhardt said it was forced to enter into a corporate debt restructuring programme with ICICI Bank to ease its liquidity constraints and lighten debts, which had shot up to Rs 4,300 crore till December.        
	Khorakiwalas son Murtaza took over as managing director from today and has been appointed an additional director. His father, however, will continue as the executive chairman. The Khorakiwalas hold around 70 per cent in the Mumbai based company.        
	Wockhardt told the BSE that on account of a potential restructuring of certain businesses and subsidiaries, the statutory audit for the year ended December 31, 2008 could not be completed in time. It expects this audit to be over by April 25.         
	We remain committed to ensuring compliance with applicable law at all times and regret this delay which has occurred due to factors beyond our control, the statement to the BSE said.        
	According to analysts, the companys troubles arose from the high debts. Sources in the company who did not wish to be quoted said $110 million was due for repayment in October.         
	Wockhardt, the analysts said, had paid a heavy price for its overseas acquisitions. It had coughed up over Rs 1,500 crore to buy Negma Legrads of France and Pinewood Labs of Ireland in 2006-07.         
	In the end, Wockhardt was forced to recast its debts. The BSE notice said: In view of the adverse market conditions, liquidity constraints and debt burden, the board decided to make a reference to corporate debt restructuring cell through ICICI Bank Limited, for financial restructuring of the debts of the company, through corporate debt restructuring mechanism.

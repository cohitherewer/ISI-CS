The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Maruti aims big with Kizashi 
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Maruti aims big with Kizashi 
          JAYANTA ROY CHOWDHURY                          Road rage                                  
	New Delhi, Dec. 22: Maruti Suzuki plans to launch the Kizashi, a crossover between a sports car and a sedan, in India next year. The car was launched earlier this year in the US and Japan.        
	The sedan, which could carry a price tag of over Rs 10 lakh, will first be showcased at the Delhi auto expo next month and a final decision on the launch will be taken based on the response at the fair.        
	Kizashi is considered by auto buffs as a replacement for GM Daewoo designed Verona. By Indian standards, the car, which has a 2.4-litre Euro IV engine, would be considered as a big sedan and could compete with the Audi A4 (Rs 29 lakh), Acura TSX (Rs 13.4 lakh), the Toyota Corolla (Rs 9 lakh), Honda Civic (Rs 11 lakh) and Ford Focus (Rs 7.6 lakh).        
	The Kizashi, which retails at over $18,999 in the US, has standard keyless ignition, rear seat vents, leather-wrapped steering wheels, and rear side airbags. Reviews say it gives about 10-11 km to the litre. Rain-sensing wipers, backup camera with ultrasonic sensors, and navigation are available on the fully-loaded version which costs nearly $27,000.        
	Maruti does not have a very happy experience with expensive sedans in India. Its Baleno model never really took off as it was seen as a fuel guzzler, while the SX4s performance had been patchy.        
	However, Kizashi, which was unveiled as a concept car in 2007, could change all that. With a sporty look and big 21-inch wheels it could catch the fancy of young car lovers in India.         
	At the expo, Suzuki plans to showcase some 17 vehicles. The display will also include the Eeco, a new 5-7 seater 1200-cc five-door car. The Eeco will probably be priced below Rs 4 lakh and be touted as the affordable car for the big family.         
	Sources said Maruti would also update most of its bestseller models, including the Wagon R and the Swift, over the next few years. The Wagon R could come in a new avatar next year itself, while a new Swift could come in two years.         
	Maruti, which has a 50 per cent share of the Indian market, wants to retain its position in the face of rivals such as the Tatas, Ford, GM, Hyundai and Honda mounting new challenges in all segments, especially at the lower end of the spectrum.         
	The firm will decide on fresh investments next month.

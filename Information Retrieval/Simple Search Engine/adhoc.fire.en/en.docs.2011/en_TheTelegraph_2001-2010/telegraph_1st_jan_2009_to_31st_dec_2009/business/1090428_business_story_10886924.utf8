The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Lenders prefer mutuals, govt papers
                                                                                                               Lenders prefer mutuals, govt papers

	Calcutta, April 27: Banks are preferring to invest in government securities and mutual funds instead of lending to companies and individuals on easy terms.         
	Such a preference has scuttled RBIs efforts to bring down lending rates of banks and, thereby, boost credit demand and economic growth.        
	According to data available with the central bank, commercial banks have increased their investments in mutual funds to Rs 90,109 crore at the end of February this year against Rs 9,229 crore as on October 10 last year when the global financial crisis hit the Indian economy.         
	Commercial banks investments in government securities during the same period rose to Rs 11,87,689 crore from Rs 9,77,884 crore.         
	Since October, the RBI has frequently lowered its key policy rates such as the cash reserve ratio (CRR), repo and reverse repo to make more money available to banks for lending at lower rates. It has also lowered the statutory liquidity ratio.        
	The apex bank has lowered CRR to 5 per cent now from 9 per cent before October, the repo rate to 4.75 per cent from 9 per cent and the reverse repo rate to 3.25 per cent from 6 per cent.         
	However, the countrys largest lender, the State Bank of India, had reduced its prime lending rate (PLR) only to 12.25 per cent from 13.75 per cent, while the largest among the private sector banks, ICICI Bank, slashed its PLR marginally to 16.25 per cent from 17.25 per cent.         
	All other commercial banks have showed similar reluctance in reducing their lending rates. Banks reluctance to lend can also be gauged by the big difference between their PLR and the reverse repo rate  the interest rate at which the Reserve Bank borrows money from them and which acts as the floor rate for the overnight call money market.         
	In the last four days of repo and reverse repo auctions since the reduction of the reverse repo rate to 3.25 per cent on April 21 by the Reserve Bank, commercial banks parked as much as Rs 2,01,725 crore in government securities under reverse repo.         
	Banks are willing to park their excess liquidity in risk-free government securities rather than lend it, said an analyst at Angel Broking.         
	Credit demand in general was subdued between October and December when interest rates and the fear of economic recession were very high. Banks became wary of credit risk of clients in the face of economic slowdown and chances of increases in bad loans, the analyst said.        
	RBI governor D. Subbarao has said at the World Bank-IMF spring meeting in Washington that the global recession may not only continue through 2009 but can also prolong itself to the next year.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                            
	Mumbai, Sept. 29: Three years after it started grading initial public offerings, rating agency Crisil today ventured into equity research of stocks listed on the secondary markets.         
	The Standard amp; Poors subsidiary today launched Independent Equity Research (IER) through which it would provide an independent assessment on the fundamentals and valuations of listed Indian companies.        
	Crisil IER will address the two parameters in the investment process fundamentals. First, it will give a fundamental grade. There will also be a valuation grade based on a companys valuation. Both these grades will be on a five-point scale with 5 being the highest grade and 1 the lowest.        
	Roopa Kudva, managing director and CEO of Crisil, said only the top 100 of the 3,500 active listed Indian companies received reasonable levels of equity research coverage.         
	Crisil IER will focus on mid-caps, small-caps and those with limited coverage. It will, however, not give buy, hold or sell recommendations.        
	Kudva said its IER could either be company-sponsored, investor-sponsored or exchange-sponsored and once a report was released, it would be monitored and updated for at least one year.        
	Sebi chairman C.B. Bhave said the report should disclose who commissioned it and whether the information provided by the company was sufficient to make an honest evaluation.

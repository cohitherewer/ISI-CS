          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Hyderabad, March 6: Satyam employees are happy that Sebi has allowed a strategic investor to pick up a 51 per cent stake in the company.         
	The investor will be picked through a global competitive bidding process.        
	It is wonderful news and the entire IT industry should be proud now that Satyam cannot be silenced even in the face of an internal scam, said a senior executive of the company.        
	The 20,000-odd employees located in Hyderabad are confident that the worst is over and they will soon regain their position in the IT industry.         
	Already banks and credit card companies have relaxed their vigil and are again allowing Satyam employees free credit.         
	But we are under pressure to clear our pending loans, said a senior manager at Satyam InfoCity campus.         
	Meanwhile, a spokesman for Maytas Infra welcomed the Company Law Boards decision to nominate four more directors on the board of the company.        
	The new members, .P. Vaish and Ved Jain, will greatly enrich the company and help salvage its reputation, he said.        
	CBI plea        
	A Hyderabad court today reserved its order on a CBI plea seeking custody of Satyam founder B. Ramalinga Raju and others for Monday.        
	After hearing the arguments of CBI counsel and defence lawyers, the XIV Additional Chief Metropolitan Magistrate reserved the order for Monday.        
	The CBI took up the Rs 7,100-crore Satyam fraud case on February 20 and filed a petition on March 3 seeking seven days custody of the Raju brothers, former Satyam CFO V. Srinivas and the two sacked auditors of Price Waterhouse for further interrogation.        
	All five are in judicial remand now and are lodged in Chanchalguda jail in Hyderabad.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Split sale of Satyam ruled out
                                                                                                               Split sale of Satyam ruled out
  - Boston Consulting to advise management        OUR BUREAU                                    
	Jan. 27: Scam-scarred Satyam Computer Services will not be carved up.        
	The board of directors of the software giant today appointed Boston Consulting Group (BCG) as its management adviser and gave two investment bankers  Goldman Sachs and Avendus  the mandate to find a strategic investor.        
	The appointments came on a day when Larsen and Toubro, the engineering giant, said it was open to the idea of raising its stake in Satyam to 15 per cent  a key threshold that would trigger an open offer. Last week, L amp;T announced that it had raised its stake in Satyam from 4 per cent to 12 per cent to have a greater say in Satyams rescue.        
	There may be a counter-bid, L amp;T chairman A. M. Naik told investors and analysts at a conference call.        
	At the end of a three-hour meeting in Hyderabad, the Satyam board said it had received several expressions of interest from companies as well as private equity firms.        
	A sale of the parts of Satyam at this stage would be contrary to the mandate of regulating the affairs of Satyam it is not an option that is being evaluated currently, said T. N. Manoharan who chaired the Satyam board meeting.        
	The company said it would pay the January salaries out of internal accruals and receivables. It is also close to finalising its funding arrangements with banks.        
	A three-member team from BCG will work closely with the Satyam board and the companys leadership during the revival process. BCG has decided to waive its fee for the assignment.        
	Goldman Sachs and Avendus have been given a three-point agenda: identify strategic investors, obtain expressions of interest, and ensure a fair and transparent approach to the entire exercise.        
	Manoharan said L amp;Ts stake purchase should not be taken as an indication of support by the government-nominated board for a change of control at Satyam.        
	This is now a government-administered company, reporting to the CLB and the ministry of corporate affairs, said Manoharan. The modalities for an open bidding process would be worked out in consultation with Sebi and the government, he added.        
	Meanwhile, reports said the Satyam board had lobbied Sebi to relax the open offer pricing regulations.         
	In a related development, Price Waterhouse today suspended two partners  S. Gopalakrishnan and Srinivas Talluri  who handled the Satyam account.        
	On the other hand, RBI governor D. Subbarao has said the central bank will review its decision to revoke the suspension on Price Waterhouse, which had been barred from auditing banks in 2003 after the Global Trust Bank scam. The ban was lifted in 2007.

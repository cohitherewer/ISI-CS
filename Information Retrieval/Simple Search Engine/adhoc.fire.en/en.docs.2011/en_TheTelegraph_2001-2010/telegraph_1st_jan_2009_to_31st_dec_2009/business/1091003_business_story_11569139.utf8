The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | New issue price band rules on way
                                                                                                               New issue price band rules on way

	Mumbai, Oct. 2: The government has directed market regulator Sebi to frame guidelines for fixing the price band for initial public offerings that adopt the book-building route.         
	The move will soothe long-suffering investors who have helplessly watched the value of their investments shrivel every time an IPO tanks on listing.        
	Salman Khurshid, minister for corporate affairs, has said the government has written to Sebi asking it to evolve a transparent mechanism for IPO pricing. We are examining it; some very good people with an experience of the capital markets are helping us. This is a matter in which we are in close consultation with Sebi. It will take three to four months, may be six months (to come out with the guidelines), he told PTI in an interview. He said the focus would be to ensure greater objectivity and transparency while fixing a price band for an IPO.        
	Sebi officials were not available for comments. Sources said the matter would have to be examined by its primary markets advisory committee.        
	In 1992, the government had deregulated the pricing of new issues in a burst of liberalisation. Until then, a body called the Controller of Capital Issues regulated the pricing of issues.         
	Under current regulations, the issuer decides the price band in consultation with the merchant banker. Sebi does not play any role in price fixation. However, there is a condition that the spread between the floor and the cap of a price band in a particular issue shall not be more than 20 per cent.         
	Arun Kejriwal, director, KRIS, which tracks the primary markets, said the pricing guidelines would ensure that investors do not get short-changed. If it happens, it will be in the interest of markets and more particularly the retail investor, he added.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                                Patel: Seeking time		    
	New Delhi, July 14: Air India has sought more time from banks to repay its existing working capital loans. It has also approached oil companies with a similar request on jet fuel bills.         
	Civil aviation minister Praful Patel said the steps were part of a larger financial restructuring plan.        
	The airline has loans from top nationalised banks, including the State Bank of India, Bank of Baroda, Canara Bank and Punjab National Bank. Air India buys most of its fuel from Oil India and some from BPCL and HPCL. It has accumulated losses of over Rs 7,220 crore and run up loans of more than Rs 15,000 crore.        
	A total financial overhaul of the airline will include rescheduling aircraft deliveries, cutting loss-making routes and rationalising manpower and incentives.        
	The government is also considering capital infusion by way of equity and soft loans.         
	After the merger of Air India with Indian Airlines, an IPO was mooted. It is in this context that an equity infusion by the government and a soft loan to tackle the adverse financial situation are being contemplated, Patel told the Rajya Sabha today.        
	Officials said if an aircraft purchase order was cancelled it could attract penal clauses. However, rescheduling deliveries or selling aircraft orders to other airlines could be considered.         
	Patel defended his ministrys decision to buy planes during the market slowdown. The ageing fleet needed replacement. About half the combined fleet is 15 years old.        
	Patel blamed a surge in oil prices, high fixed costs, high expenditure on insurance, interest on working capital and aircraft loans and plane lease payments for the airlines financial woes.         
	The airline had to delay the payment of salaries because of a cash crunch.

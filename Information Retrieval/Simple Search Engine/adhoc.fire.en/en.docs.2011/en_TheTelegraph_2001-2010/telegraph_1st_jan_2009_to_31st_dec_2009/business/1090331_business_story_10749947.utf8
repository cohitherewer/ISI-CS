          JAYANTA ROY CHOWDHURY                          Singh: Game plan				                                 
	New Delhi, March 30: Prime Minister Manmohan Singh is likely to pitch for transparent rules on tax havens, where wealth is often stashed away by some Indians, at the G20 summit.        
	As he prepares for the April 2 meeting in London which is on the global financial crisis, Singh will be aware of poll rival L.K. Advanis intentions to bring back the countrys black wealth.        
	Though that may be a tall order for him, Singh will emphasise on rules of conduct for the offshore havens.        
	Controlling tax havens is part of a broader bid to overhaul the regulatory structure of the global economy wracked by the financial crisis that has brought about the collapse of major financial institutions and huge job losses after credit dried up.        
	On the agenda at the London meeting is a road map to clamp down on tax cheats who park their money in places such as Switzerland or Luxembourg and then bring it back through other tax havens such as the Mauritius, Channel Islands and Bahamas.        
	India may support Germany and France who want the tax havens to be blacklisted if they dont meet the new rules. Some Indians are alleged to have stashed away huge sums abroad.         
	A 2006 report of the Swiss Banking Association said Indians were among the biggest depositors of black money in Swiss banks. According to some calculations, the sum is more than the countrys foreign exchange reserves.        
	Revenue officials said that the new norms would ensure that the screening for funds did not scare away genuine foreign investments. Mauritius  a tax haven  leads in FDI to India.        
	Various parliamentary panels and the National Security Advisor have been suggesting better control over tax havens after several stock and promissory note scams.

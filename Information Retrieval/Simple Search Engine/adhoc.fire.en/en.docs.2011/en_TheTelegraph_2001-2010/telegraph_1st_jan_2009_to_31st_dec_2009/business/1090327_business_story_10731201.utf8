The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Inflation dip triggers rate-cut debate
                                                                                                               Inflation dip triggers rate-cut debate
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                            
	New Delhi, March 26: The fall in the inflation rate to 0.27 per cent  the lowest in 30 years  has sparked a debate on the scope for interest rate cuts.        
	While RBI governor D. Subbarao said a cut in policy rates should reflect in lending rates, Indian Banks Association chairman T. S. Narayanasami ruled out an immediate cut in interest rates, saying yields were attractive enough for banks to park their money in government bonds.        
	However, ICICI Banks CEO and managing director K. V. Kamath said the countrys second largest lender would take a call on reducing interest rates in a few weeks but high bond yields were coming in the way.        
	We are talking to banks to understand what their perception is. Policy rates have to be transmitted to lending rates by banks. We are investigating about the transmission mechanism, Subbarao said at a CII meeting here.        
	Narayanasami said banks could not lower their lending rates under the current scenario.        
	There is no more headroom for banks to cut their prime lending rates and deposit rates in the near future, Narayanasami said and added that the apex bank had done enough and further steps by the RBI would not help.         
	Kamath, on the other hand, said, Banks are clearly waiting for the cost of funds to go down. But they should start considering a 0.50 per cent cut in interest rates, he said.         
	Though Kamath sounded positive, he, too, was concerned about the high bond yields.        
	Things are moving in that (interest rate cut) direction, but there are some barriers left. Deposit rates have gone down, there has been easing from central bank. But the bump is that yields on 10-year treasury bonds, which should have been less than 5 per cent, has spiked more than 6 per cent, he said, adding it is a temporary block.        
	In a month we can see some 50 basis points cut in key rates. Right now there is enough liquidity and the RBI has taken proactive measures, said D.K. Joshi of Crisil.        
	Food for thought        
	While the inflation rate is near zero, food prices remained high because of a high minimum support price and low production of pulses and coarse cereals.        
	The 0.17 percentage point decline in inflation in the second week of March from 0.44 per cent in the week ended March 7 was attributed partly to a high base effect as the rate was 8.02 per cent in the same period a year ago.

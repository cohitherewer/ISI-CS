 Fuel price freedom in pipeline          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Petroleum minister Murli Deora with minister of state for oil Jitin Prasada in New Delhi on Friday. Picture by Ramakant Kushwaha                                        
	New Delhi, May 29: Consumers will have to pay at least Rs 3 more for petrol if the cabinet clears an oil ministry move to free fuel prices after five-and-a-half years.         
	However, rising crude prices have cast doubts on the governments plans to go ahead with the deregulation and end oil subsidies.        
	The issue of deregulation is being discussed and it will be placed before the cabinet for a decision, petroleum minister Murli Deora told reporters today after taking charge for the second time.         
	He said a decision was likely in about six weeks. Jitin Prasada also took over as the minister of state for petroleum.        
	Petrol now costs Rs 44.05 a litre in Calcutta and diesel, Rs 33.21. The previous UPA government had lowered fuel prices twice in recent times, once in December and then in January.        
	The average price of the Indian basket of crude in the first fortnight of May was $50 a barrel, which had now increased to $57. In New York today, crude oil futures traded above $66 a barrel.        
	Officials said state-owned oil companies were once again making losses on the sale of petrol (over Rs 3 per litre), diesel (less than 10 paise), kerosene (about Rs 14 per litre) and domestic LPG cylinder (over Rs 100). This could deter the government from taking such an unpopular decision within 100 days of assuming office.        
	Deora said, The government will address the need to provide fuel and petroleum products to people at reasonable prices along with the requirement of oil marketing companies to run profitably and efficiently.        
	According to the draft note prepared for the cabinet, the three state-owned oil PSUs will be allowed to fix petrol and diesel prices as long as crude stays below $75 a barrel.         
	If crude is above $75, the government will provide subsidy so that the higher price is not passed on to other commodities, which will fuel inflation.        
	The note also favours higher prices of natural gas produced by Oil and Natural Gas Corporation Ltd and Oil India Ltd from fields, which the government gave them on a nomination basis.         
	If the cabinet clears the proposal, ONGC and OIL are likely to sell gas at a price of $4.2 per million metric British thermal unit (mmBtu) against $1.97 per mmBtu now.         
	At the new rates, the PSU duo will be selling at a price equivalent to Reliance Industries gas find in the Krishna-Godavari basin.        
	The petroleum ministry is confident of getting a cabinet clearance for tax benefits to exploration and production firms striking gas in the eighth round of the new exploration and licensing policy (Nelp-VIII).        
	The definition of mineral oil under section 80 IB (9) of the income tax act needs to be clarified so that it includes natural gas. For this, the cabinet committee of economic affairs will take a decision, Deora said.        
	The Indian government had to defer the roadshows under Nelp-VIII  a record 70 oil and gas blocks are on offer  because investors had raised concerns over the lack of tax incentives in gas production.        
	The minister said the roadshow to attract oil and gas blocks would begin soon.        
	India is offering 24 deep-sea blocks, 28 shallow-water blocks and 18 onland blocks for bidding and hopes to attract $3 billion investment.        
	Share prices of the three state-run oil marketing firms  Indian Oil, Bharat Petroleum and Hindustan Petroleum  rose on the BSE today.        
	IOC gained 6.9 per cent to Rs 609.30, BPCL climbed 3.7 per cent to Rs 464.95 and Hindustan Petroleum rose 8.3 per cent to Rs 363.30.        
	Deora said he would also focus on LPG connections in rural areas.               
	At present, 9,350 LPG agencies cover only 50 per cent of the population and we want to extend the coverage to every nook and corner, he said.                                 
	The Gramin LPG Vitrak scheme would be launched at locations having potential of up to 1,000 refills per month.

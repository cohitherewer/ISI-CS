The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Bad loans set to soar
                                                                                                               Bad loans set to soar
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Trouble in queue                                  
	Mumbai, April 23: Banks face the prospect of being saddled with bad loans worth Rs 1.9 lakh crore in the next two years  a three-fold jump from current levels, says rating agency Crisil.        
	Blame it all on the economic downturn.        
	The gross non-performing assets (NPAs)  banking jargon for the entire suite of bad loans that are broken into three categories based on the potential for eventual recovery  rose to Rs 56,400 crore as on March 31, 2008, according to the RBI.        
	In a study released today, Crisil said banks gross NPAs would rise to around 5 per cent of overall advances by March 2011. At the end of March 2008, gross NPAs accounted for 2.3 per cent of all advances.        
	Raman Uberoi, senior director at Crisil Ratings, said the deteriorating asset quality could impact banks profits. Uberoi said banks profitability would be badly roiled if there were no significant movements in debt markets or bond prices. Banks benefit from any rise in the prices of government securities.        
	The absolute profit after tax of the industry for the industry till March 31, 2011 could grow in the region of 10 to 12 per cent. It grew 30 to 40 per cent in the past. This, however, does not factor in treasury gains, he told reporters after Crisil released its report.        
	Banks will see their profits crimped because of the provisions they have to make for the NPAs they carry on their books. Banks are expected to face a cumulative additional provisioning requirement of Rs 77,000 crore by March 2011, which works out to about Rs 25,000 crore a year. This is nearly 60 per cent of the industrys profit after tax of Rs 42,700 crore in 2007-08.        
	Interestingly, the growth in bank NPAs will be largely on account of the corporate sector. Crisil said the increase in NPAs would be driven by incremental delinquencies in the corporate loan book, which accounts for about 56 per cent of Indian banks advances. The gross NPA ratio in this segment is projected to more than double to around 4.1 per cent by March 2011 from 1.6 per cent as on March 31, 2008.

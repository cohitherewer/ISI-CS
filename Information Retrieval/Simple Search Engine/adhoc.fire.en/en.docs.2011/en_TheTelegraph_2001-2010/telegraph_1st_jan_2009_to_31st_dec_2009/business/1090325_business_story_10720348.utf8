	New Delhi, March 24: Air-India has renewed its interest in the A-380, the worlds largest passenger aircraft with a seating capacity of 850.        
	A-380 maker Airbus today held talks with Air India. The two had previously discussed the aircraft in 2007.        
	Yes, we are in talks with Air India for our A-380 aircraft, said Srinivasan Dwarkanath, head of international co-operation (India and East Asia) at Airbus. Similar talks with Air India in 2007 had failed.         
	A senior Air India official confirmed the talks but maintained that the purchase of the A-380 was at a planning stage.        
	If a deal is struck, Airbus expects to sell at least 10 A-380s.         
	Vijay Mallyas Kingfisher Airlines is the only Indian carrier to have placed an order for the aircraft. Five A-380s are due for delivery from 2010-11.        
	European firm Airbus has delivered over 400 aircraft to Indian carriers and has orders for over 240.        
	Analysts said Indian carriers would purchase more than 900 aircraft by 2025.        
	Christian Scherer, executive vice-president of Airbus, put the demand at 1,100, including cargo planes, by 2029.         
	Air traffic worldwide will double every 15 years with India being one of the growth engines, Scherer said.         
	Srinivasan said Airbus planned to spend $1 billion in India over the next 10 years if it found the right partners and the right projects.        
	European Aeronautic Defence and Space Co, Airbuss parent, is also setting up a maintenance, repair and overhaul unit at the Indira Gandhi International Airport by refurbishing Air Indias existing infrastructure.        
	I think we will be able to start in the second quarter of the next fiscal, said Srinivasan.

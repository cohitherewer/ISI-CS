The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Bengal SEZ builders seek more time
                                                                                                               Bengal SEZ builders seek more time
          SOUNAK MITRA                                             
	Calcutta, Aug. 16: Many developers of SEZs in Bengal, which have received in-principle approval from the commerce ministry, have either shelved their plans or want more time to acquire land.        
	Among them are Purnendu Chatterjee-led The Chatterjee Group, Venugopal Dhoots Videocon and a city-based Rahul Saraf-headed consortium.        
	A proposed SEZ first gets in-principle approval, when the developer is yet to get land. After the developer acquires land, the SEZ gets formal approval. Following the formal approval, an SEZ is notified by the central government.        
	The Chatterjee Group  which had obtained in-principle approval for an IT SEZ on 494 acres in Siliguri  has dropped its plans because of land acquisition problems. A few months back, DLF had sought a denotification for a proposed IT SEZ over 10.12 hectares at Rajarhat.         
	At present, there are three SEZs in the state Falta, Manikanchan and Wipro. Till March 2009, the government has given in-principle approval to 14 proposals in the state, formal approval to 14 and notified 9.         
	Problems of land acquisition in Bengal for industrial purposes started with Singur and Nandigram.         
	The Tatas were forced to shift the Nano factory from Singur to Sanand in Gujarat following an agitiation by Mamata Banerjee.         
	At Nandigram, police firing led to the loss of 14 lives two years ago. The Bengal government had to move the site of the chemical hub to nearby Nayachar.        
	Land-related problems have made DLF pull the plug on its proposed township project at Dankuni.         
	Recently, a consortium formed by local mall developer Rahul Saraf, too, exited Bengals biggest IT park venture, which was supposed to come up at Jagadishpur near Rajarhat on the northern fringes of Calcutta.         
	Many firms have sought an extension to complete land acquisition. These include Videocon Realty amp; Infrastructures, which requires 5,560 acres for two SEZs (3,060 acres for an engineering and electronics SEZ in North 24-Parganas and 2,500 acres for a multi-product SEZ in Kharagpur), Salarpuria Properties (250 acres for an electronics SEZ in North 24-Parganas) and SEZ Infrastructure (262.5 acres for an engineering SEZ in Howrah).         
	Eighty-six proposals to set up units in big and medium sectors in the state were approved in 2007-08, involving an investment of Rs 228,039 crore. In 2005-06 and 2006-07, 667 units were approved, involving an investment of Rs 63,883 crore.         
	The estimated employment generation in the new units would be 642,420.

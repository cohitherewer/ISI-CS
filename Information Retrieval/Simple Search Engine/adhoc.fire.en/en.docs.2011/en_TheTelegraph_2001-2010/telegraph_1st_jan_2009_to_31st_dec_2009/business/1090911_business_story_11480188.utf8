                                                                                                               Marginal fall in tea exports
          A STAFF REPORTER                                            
	Calcutta, Sept. 10: Lower production and robust internal demand dragged down tea exports by 4 per cent during the first seven months of this year.        
	Total exports during the January-July period were 94 million kg compared with 109.3 million kg a year ago.        
	However, exports in value terms rose to Rs 1,258.06 crore during January-July from Rs 1,161.59 crore in the same period last year.        
	India mainly exports CTC (crush-tear-curl) tea to Egypt, Pakistan and the UK and the premium orthodox variety to Iraq, Iran and Russia.        
	Production during January-July fell 3.3 per cent to 460.88 million kg from 476.63 million kg in the year-ago period, according to the latest statistics published by the Tea Board of India and the Indian Tea Association.        
	Total output in July was down 4 million kg to 126.98 million kg, mainly because of a fall in production in Bengal. However, Assam produced more during the same month.        
	Higher local consumption pushed up prices to Rs 133.8 per kg in January-July from Rs 106.27 per kg during the year-ago period.

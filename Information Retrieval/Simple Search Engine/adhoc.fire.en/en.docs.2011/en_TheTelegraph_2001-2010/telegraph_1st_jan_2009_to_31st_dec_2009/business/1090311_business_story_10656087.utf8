The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | RIL seeks to lease out petrol pumps
                                                                                                               RIL seeks to lease out petrol pumps
          PIYA SINGH                          Strategy twist                                  
	Mumbai, March 10: Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL) is mulling over a proposal to lease its over 1,400 petrol pumps scattered all over the country to public sector oil marketing companies such as Hindustan Petroleum (HPCL), Bharat Petroleum (BPCL) and Indian Oil Corporation (IOC).         
	Reliance shut down all its petrol pumps sometime ago as it was unable to compete with the state-run companies, which sold fuel at subsidised prices.         
	It is now looking to the state-owned oil marketers to bail it out of a sticky situation.        
	Sources said while the company was looking for an outright lease of its pumps, RIL is also keen to sell fuel from its refinery in Jamnagar to the three-state owned companies.        
	This throws up a slightly bizarre situation where IOC and the other two state-owned giants  which have refineries of their own  buy petrol and diesel from RIL and then sell the fuels through the Reliance-owned pumps that they take on lease.         
	Blame it all on the dramatic slump in crude oil prices since October last year which wrecked the play for oil refiners such as Reliance, which had been making profits from exports. Reel back a bit to April when Reliance Industries secured government approval that conferred the status of an export oriented unit (EOU) on the Jamnagar refinery.        
	Under the EOU scheme, companies are entitled to duty-free imports but can sell only up to 25 per cent of their production in the domestic tariff area under certain restrictions.         
	Reliance has been caught in a bind because the turmoil in the global markets makes exports uneconomical, while the EOU status of the refinery restricts opportunity for sales in the domestic market.        
	The Mukesh Ambani-owned giant has been badgering the government to provide certain duty relaxations that will enable the state-owned oil marketers to lift Reliance products and sell them through their distribution channels.        
	The plan wont work without these duty concessions since the EOU status of Reliances Jamnagar refinery in Gujarat will deem such a purchase by the state-run firms as imports and, hence, jack up prices for sale in the domestic tariff area.        
	A spokesperson for RIL did not comment on the companys discussions with the state-run companies.        
	However, sources said refining and marketing were two separate businesses and RIL was open to an outright lease of its pumps rather than let them lie idle. It is still unclear how RIL will fix the lease rentals for these pumps since this is a completely uncharted territory.         
	Sources said the rentals could be worked out on the basis of the potential business that each petrol pump was likely to generate. It is learnt that during its discussions with the PSU retailers, RIL had also initiated talks on co-branding of these petrol pumps.         
	RIL is open to a joint branding exercise with the public sector companies for the pumps that are concentrated in the golden quadrilateral and initially target customers who operate diesel vehicles.        
	Earlier news agencies reported that Reliance was also in talks with the state-run fuel retailers to boost its aviation refueling business. The company had written to BPCL, HPCL and IOC seeking partnerships in both the fuel retailing and aviation services businesses.         
	The state-run companies havent responded to RILs proposal as yet.

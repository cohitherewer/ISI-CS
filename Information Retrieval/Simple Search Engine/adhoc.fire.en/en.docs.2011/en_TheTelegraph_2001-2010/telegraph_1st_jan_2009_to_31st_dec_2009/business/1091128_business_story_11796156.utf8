	Bangalore, Nov. 27: ArcelorMittal has shortlisted three sites in northern Karnataka for its steel plant, chief minister B.S. Yeddyurappa said today.        
	The Karnataka project is in addition to the ones proposed in Orissa and Jharkhand. Mittal is yet to get land and iron ore mines in the two states.        
	We are pursuing the Orissa and Jharkhand projects continuously, said Vijay Kumar Bhatnagar, executive vice-president and CEO (India and China) of ArcelorMittal, after a meeting with Yeddyurappa.        
	In Karnataka, ArcelorMittal plans to invest Rs 30,000 crore in the first phase in an integrated steel plant with a capacity of 6 million tonnes per annum and a 750MW captive power plant. Around 4,000 acres will be required for the project.         
	They have shown interest in three locations and the final site will be decided soon, Yeddyurappa told reporters.        
	Karnataka industries minister Murugesh Nirani said the company was shown land in some northern districts, including in iron-ore rich Bellary, which has been declared a steel zone.        
	The firm had proposed to build two 12mt plants at a combined investment of Rs 100,000 crore in the two eastern states.                          
	Karnataka industries minister Murugesh Nirani said the company was shown land in northern districts of Belllary and Dharwad. The state government has announced iron-ore rich Bellary and the neighbouring districts as a steel zone.        
	We have gone and done the survey. we have shortlisted some sites. We need to get into much more detail, Bhatnagar said.        
	Nirani said the steel maker would decide on a location in a months time, and the government was expected to hand over the land in six months.        
	Since January, Karnataka has cleared at least nien integrated steel plants, including a proposal by Bellary-based JSW Steel to expand its capacity from 10 million tones per annum to 16 million tonnes at an investment of Rs 15,000 crore.        
	Depending on the iron ore availability, we will give clearances, said Nirani, adding that they would decide on approvals after considering the ore requirement of existing and ongoing projects.        
	The Karnataka government aims to create a land bank of at least 50,000 acres to woo investors, primarily to the states northern districts many of which are remain backward because of lopsided growth that has seen industries cluster around Bangalore.         
	As many as 449 of the 779 mega and heavy industries in the state are located in Bangalore Urban and Rural districts, according to a report by the Federation of Indian Industry Chambers of Commerce and Industry (Ficci) and Konrad Adenauer Foundation, a Germany-based research group.

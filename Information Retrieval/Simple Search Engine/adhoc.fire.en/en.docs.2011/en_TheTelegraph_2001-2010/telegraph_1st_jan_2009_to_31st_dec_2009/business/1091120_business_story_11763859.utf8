The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Status quo on fuel prices
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      Status quo on fuel prices
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Decision on hold                                  
	New Delhi, Nov. 19: The government today ruled out any immediate hike in the prices of petrol and diesel because of the hardening of global crude rates.         
	Forced to sell fuel below costs as crude gets dearer, state-owned oil marketing companies are lobbying the petroleum ministry for a hike.        
	There is no proposal (to raise fuel prices) under consideration at present. I cannot say what will happen in the future, but right now we are not considering (a price hike), petroleum secretary R.S. Pandey said.         
	Oil firms IOC, BPCL and HPCL are losing Rs 3.85 per litre on petrol, Rs 3.71 a litre on diesel, Rs 16.34 a litre on kerosene and Rs 201.88 per LPG cylinder.         
	Pandey said the trio could lose Rs 45,160 crore in this fiscal.         
	Oil retailers suffer losses because they have to sell fuel below cost at prices fixed by the government.        
	In June, the government had hiked the prices of petrol by Rs 4 a litre and diesel by Rs 2.        
	The government has formed a five-member committee, headed by Planning Commission member Kirit S. Parikh, to suggest reforms in the pricing of fuels.         
	Parikhs team will review the taxes on fuels and examine the health of the PSU oil firms to come up with its recommendations on pricing.        
	The government had said that in the current financial year, it would only issue bonds for the losses on kerosene and cooking gas; in petrol and diesel, the losses would be borne mostly by the upstream companies.         
	However, the government has so far not issued any bonds.        
	The oil ministry has sought bonds of Rs 11,853 crore for the state-run retailers.        
	In the absence of the bonds, HPCL and BPCL posted net losses in the July-September quarter. The net loss of HPCL was Rs 136.68 crore, while BPCLs loss was Rs 158.77 crore.

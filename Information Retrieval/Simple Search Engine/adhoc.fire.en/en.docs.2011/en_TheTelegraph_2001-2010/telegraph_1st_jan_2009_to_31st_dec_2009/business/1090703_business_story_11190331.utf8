          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, July 2: The government should cut customs duty and streamline export promotion schemes, the economic survey today said. It also proposed that customs duty on textiles be revised to ensure that it matches the ad valorem tax rates.        
	Besides the short-term relief measures and stimulus packages, some fundamental policy changes are needed for the export sector, said the survey tabled by finance minister Pranab Mukherjee in Lok Sabha.        
	The measures include continuing to reduce customs and excise duty to make exports and industry competitive, streamlining existing export promotion schemes and giving special attention to infrastructure.        
	The survey cautioned that the global meltdown, particularly in the US and the European Union, is expected to impact the countrys export growth in 2009-10.        
	Merchandise exports declined 29.2 per cent in May  contracting for the eighth month in a row  over the same month last year. Exports turned negative in October 2008. In the last fiscal, exports grew by a meagre 3.4 per cent to $168.7 billion.        
	A. Sakthivel, president of the Federation of Indian Export Organisations, said the government must announce measures to support trade as World Bank data indicate a further decline in global economic growth.         
	Measures such as higher subvention of interest and higher rates of duty drawback and DEPB need to be considered urgently, Sakthivel said.

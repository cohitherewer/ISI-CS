The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Stress on lineage of Satyam bidder 
                                                                                                               Stress on lineage of Satyam bidder 
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Show time                                        
	Such an approach will assure Satyams global clients that the bidder has serious intentions and is not an asset stripper, senior officials of the ministry of corporate affairs said.        
	The board of Satyam, the countrys fourth largest software firm, will soon invite bids for the beleaguered company. The firm has unstated legal liabilities from class action suits filed against it in the US by investors.        
	Engineering major Larsen amp; Toubro, which has already acquired around 12 per cent of Satyams equity, will be a serious contender for the slot of a strategic partner. L amp;T holds the reputation of being an ethical business house and has taken significant exposure to the company.        
	It has spent about Rs 650-670 crore to pick up the stake in Satyam and is expected to buy more over the next few weeks.        
	Others likely in the race are B.K. Modi-led Spice and the Hinduja group.        
	Satyam has been battling for survival since the beginning of this year when founder chairman of the software giant B. Ramalinga Raju confessed to a Rs 7,100-crore accounting fraud.         
	Satyam had some of the biggest global names, including GE, Nestle, Qantas and Fujitsu, as clients. But many of them are believed to have shifted to rival IT firms. Satyam, founded in 1987, made its name by helping firms tackle the Y2K computer bug. The government has replaced the Satyam board with nominee directors who are big names in the world of business.        
	However, many believe the best way to nurse the Hyderabad-based firm back to health is to involve a strategic partner, which can bring in managerial skills and corporate respectability.        
	Yesterday, corporate affairs minister P. C. Gupta had said, The board will find a strategic investor for Satyam through an international competitive bidding within the next few weeks.        
	CBI plea        
	A Hyderabad court will hear the CBIs plea for the custody of Satyams former chairman B. Ramalinga Raju and four others on March 6.         
	The CBI counsel had informed the XIV additional chief metropolitan magistrate that it was collecting the Supreme Courts judgments in support of its plea after a defence lawyer challenged the CBIs move to take the custody of Raju and others, saying that a fresh custody for interrogation could not be given once the first one had lapsed.        
	The CBI counsel has asked for two more days to start the proceedings. The CBI has recently taken over the case from the Andhra Pradesh CID.        
	Yesterday, the CBI filed an application for seven days custody of Raju and his brothers and others accused to interrogate them in the Rs 7,100-crore Satyam fraud case.        
	The judge will also hear the bail applications of S. Gopalakrishnan and Talluri Srinivas, former auditors of Price Waterhouse, on March 6.        
	Raju was arrested on January 18. The case was being investigated by the Andhra Pradesh CID before being transferred to the CBI, which registered a case on February 20.

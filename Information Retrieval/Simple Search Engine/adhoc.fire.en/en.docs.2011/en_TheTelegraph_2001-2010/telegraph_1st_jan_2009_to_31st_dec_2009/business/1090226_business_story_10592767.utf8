                                                                                                               Leyland, HM take lead in price cut 
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Feb. 25: Ashok Leyland and Hindustan Motors (HM) have cut the prices of their vehicles following yesterdays excise reliefs.        
	Tata Motors and Eicher Group are still to finalise their reductions.         
	Hinduja flagship Ashok Leyland will cut prices of its trucks by an average of over Rs 16,000.        
	In line with the excise duty reduction to 8 per cent from 10 per cent in respect of trucks and auto components, Ashok Leyland will pass on the full benefit to its customers, the company said.        
	R. Seshasayee, managing director of Ashok Leyland, however, said the demand for commercial vehicles was unlikely to rise much as construction, road development and mining activities were yet to pick up.        
	The government had reduced the excise duty on commercial vehicles to 10 per cent from 14 per cent in December. The manufacturers reduced prices, which led to marginal growth in sales in January.         
	However, sales between April and January were substantially lower.         
	Hindustan Motors today cut the price of its light commercial vehicle Winger by an average of about Rs 7,000.        
	We have responded to the governments move by passing on the benefit from the excise duty cut to our customers. This move will certainly help in increasing demand, said Ravi Santhanam, managing director, Hindustan Motors.        
	The Winger will now cost about Rs 3.83 lakh (ex-showroom) against Rs 3.90 lakh now.

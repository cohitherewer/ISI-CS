The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Infrastructure spending to top govt agenda
                                                                                                               Infrastructure spending to top govt agenda

	The Manmohan Singhled government, which has received a massive poll mandate, is expected to pump prime the economy by shovelling more money into the infrastructure sector.         
	However, there is a very strong possibility that it will make a course correction in its approach to infrastructure development in specific sectors. It will almost certainly give fresh impetus to the existing plans before embarking on new initiatives.         
	Infrastructure spending will be one of the main measures to revive the economy, and we can surely expect greater speed in finalising and implementing plans which were started or thought of in the last few years.         
	The funds flow through the foreign direct investment (FDI) route will be easier now given the increased confidence of FIIs in India. However, infrastructure growth requires enhanced liquidity and softening of interest rates and this can become the top priority of the new government. The government should also ensure that the prices of inputs such as bitumen, steel and cement do not rise.         
	In the last few years, especially in the last one year, the number of public private partnership (PPP) toll projects awarded by the NHAI has declined. The reasons for the decline are believed to be a lack of clarity in the market regarding certain model documents and frequent changes in them. Whatever the reasons, the government will like to identify and address them on a priority basis.        
	The future plans of Indian Railways will depend on the vision of the new railway minister. The ministry of railways had already shelved plans to enter into joint ventures to develop new rolling stock factories. It has finalised plans to develop the factories on its own.         
	Work on one of the most ambitious projects of the ministry, the dedicated freight corridor, has not yet shown any real progress. The new government has to review the plan and finalise the funding for the corridors.         
	The government could also revive its old plan to upgrade its non-metro airports.         
	Developing India as a local port hub will need more planning and fresh thinking on the part of the government.         
	The focus will be on developing and expanding existing ports, but container transportation will need special emphasis as a growing area.         
	This will also require elaborate cross-sector planning by the new government. In the power sector, while the government is expected to continue to focus on mega power schemes, some measures are required in renewable energy. The government has to provide incentives to address the ever increasing demand-supply gap in power generation.         
	The government might, on a priority basis, decide to raise the exposure limit of banks to the power sector.         
	The norms governing the Power Finance Corporation and the Rural Electrification Corporation on lending could be relaxed.

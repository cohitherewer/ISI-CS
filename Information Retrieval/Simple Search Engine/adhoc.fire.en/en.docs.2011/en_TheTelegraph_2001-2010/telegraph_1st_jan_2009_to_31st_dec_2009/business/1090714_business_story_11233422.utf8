	Calcutta, July 13: Calcutta has fewer employment opportunities compared with other cities.         
	According to a report published by TeamLease Services, Calcutta has slipped to the bottom of the employment outlook index for the July-September quarter of this year.        
	However, the study sees signs of revival in the overall employment scenario of India for the quarter under review. The net employment outlook index stands at 46 per cent for July-September 2009, an increase of 22 per cent compared with the previous quarter.        
	Like other cities, the employment outlook for Calcutta has also grown. But the growth is least compared with others, TeamLease general manager Surabhi Mathur-Gandhi told The Telegraph.        
	The employment outlook index for Chennai increased 37 per cent, followed by Delhi and Pune where the increases were the same at 33 per cent and Hyderabad, 28 per cent. Calcutta recorded a rise of only 4 per cent.        
	According to Mathur, Normally, companies consider Calcutta for satellite regional facilities. So, hiring at Calcutta centres is less. The Calcutta market is quite stagnant compared with other metros.        
	The job market here is much more stable than in other cities. We hope that things will take a better shape soon, Vishambhar Saran, president of the Indian Chamber of Commerce, said.        
	We cannot comment on the matter without going through the report in detail, said Aniruddha Lahiri, chairman of the local chapter of the American Chamber of Commerce in Calcutta.         
	Government officials could not be reached for comments.        
	The report said IT amp; ITeS held least growth prospects for Calcutta with zero points each. Financial services topped with 14 points, while infrastructure and pharma come second with 8 points each. In terms of business outlook, Calcutta comes second (43 points) after Pune (47). Then comes Delhi (33) and Mumbai (31).         
	During the past three months, Hyderabad, Chennai and Bangalore had the highest attrition rates, while Calcutta had the lowest.               
	Attrition rate is the highest in Bangalore compared with other cities over last year at 23 per cent.        
	The report is a quarterly report prepared through a survey administered to HR heads, CEOs and senior management of leading companies. The report covers 495 companies.

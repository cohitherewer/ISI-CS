The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | China firm tops Jindal offer
                                                                                                                           6                                                                                      China firm tops Jindal offer
          SAMBIT SAHA                                            
	Calcutta, Dec. 29: Chinese coking coal firm Meijin Energy has put in a higher bid than Jindal Steel and Power Ltd (JSPL) for Australias Rocklands Richfield Ltd.        
	Meijin has now offered 56 Australian cents per share compared with 52 cents proposed by Navin Jindals JSPL.        
	Rocklands has given JSPL time till 7.30pm (Perth time) tomorrow, or 5pm in India, to come up with a matching bid.        
	The latest twist comes at a time JSPL is about to close its due diligence of the Australian company and prepare a final sale agreement.        
	Rocklands had earlier told its shareholders that Jindal would try to complete the due diligence by December 15 and conclude a definitive agreement by the end of the year.        
	However, JSPL is yet to complete the due diligence. If the Jindals agree to match the Meijin offer, they will have to shell out Aus $197 million.        
	Industry sources said Navin Jindal was betting big on Rocklands. His firm had opened an office in Down Under and was scouting for mine opportunities in the country.        
	Jindal also did an aerial survey of the area under Rocklands a few weeks back.        
	Rocklands has coal tenements in Queensland that are estimated to hold more than 900 million tonnes of reserves. It also operates a coking coal plant in eastern China.        
	After the offer made by Meijin, the Rocklands stock spurted on the Australian Securities Exchange to close at 41.5 cents, up 25.76 per cent.        
	After JSPL signed a term sheet agreement in September, Indias Essar and Chinas Meijin had entered the race to compete with the Jindals. While Essar backed out, Meijin is still in the fray.        
	Jindal Steel has also picked up a 16 per cent stake in Rocklands.

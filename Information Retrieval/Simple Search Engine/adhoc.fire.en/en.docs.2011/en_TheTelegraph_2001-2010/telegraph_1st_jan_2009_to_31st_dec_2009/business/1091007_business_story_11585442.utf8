The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Business | Telecom stocks take a beating
                                                                                                               Telecom stocks take a beating
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                            
	Mumbai, Oct. 6: Telecom stocks swooned today amid fears that the industrys fortunes would be battered by a raging rate war initiated by Anil Ambani-owned Reliance Communications (R-Com) and the regulators plan to make per second billing mandatory from next year.        
	Shares of Bharti Airtel, R-Com, Idea Cellular, Tata Teleservices (Maharashtra) and MTNL tumbled by 5-11 per cent as experts said the margins of the telecom players would be badly crimped in the next few quarters.        
	Investors dumped these shares even as brokerages de-rated the sector. The downgrades were made on concerns that surging competition and a possible price war would not only hurt revenues but also profitability.        
	On Monday, R-Com announced a call tariff of 50 paise per minute for all local and STD calls to any mobile or landline network from anywhere in the country. This raised fears that the offer would lead to a price war in a fiercely competitive mobile telephony market where tariffs are already the lowest in the world.        
	The impact of the two announcements sent R-Com tumbling 10.64 per cent, or Rs 31.95, to close at Rs 268.25. The Bharti Airtel scrip lost 10.22 per cent, or Rs 40.90, to close at Rs 359.40. Idea Cellular, the AV Birla group company, ended 8.29 per cent lower at Rs 64.75, while state-owned MTNL lost nearly 5 per cent.        
	Brokerages took a pessimistic note of the whole development by pointing out that the developments could impact the industrys revenue by 10-15 per cent. Kotak Securities has downgraded the industry with its analysts observing that the next one to two years will be a tough ride for the mobile players because of new entrants coming in and pricing pressure building up.

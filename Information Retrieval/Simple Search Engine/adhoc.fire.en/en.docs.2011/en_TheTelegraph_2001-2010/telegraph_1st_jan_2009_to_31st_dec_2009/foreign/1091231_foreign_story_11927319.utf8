The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Obama slams security agencies for failure
                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      Obama slams security agencies for failure

	Kaneohe (Hawaii), Dec. 30 (Reuters): President Barack Obama yesterday blamed a combination of human and systemic failures for allowing the botched Christmas Day attack aboard a Detroit-bound US airliner, in his first big test on homeland security.        
	Interrupting a vacation in Hawaii for the second straight day to reassure Americans that he will keep the US safe, Obama listed several safeguards that failed to prevent a 23-year-old Islamic militant from Nigeria from smuggling explosives onto a plane to the US.        
	When our government has information on a known extremist and that information is not shared and acted upon as it should have been so that this extremist boards a plane with dangerous explosives that could cost nearly 300 lives, a systemic failure has occurred. And I consider that totally unacceptable, Obama said at a Marine Corps base near his vacation home.        
	Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab, the suspect who claims to have been trained by al Qaida in Yemen, is accused of trying to ignite explosives sewn inside his underwear on Northwest Flight 253 from Amsterdam as it approached Detroit. He was subdued by passengers and crew.        
	Republicans have criticised what they see as the Obama administrations failures in preventing such an attack as well as the Presidents decision to remain silent in the days after Fridays incident.        
	A senior administration official told reporters in Hawaii there was some link between al Qaida and the attempted attack, according to new information that prompted yesterdays presidential statement.        
	There were bits of information available within the intelligence community that could have and should have been pieced together, Obama said.        
	What is apparent was that there was a mix of human and systemic failures that contributed to this potential catastrophic breach of security, he added.        
	Obama said he has asked to hear preliminary findings by tomorrow on reviews he ordered after the incident on the way the US places people on a terrorist watch list.        
	Dutch body scanners        
	Amsterdams Schiphol Airport will begin using full-body scanners within three weeks to check people travelling to the US, after consultations with American authorities, a Dutch interior minister said.

                              Berry: Yes to motherhood                            
	London, Aug. 3 (PTI): Bond girl Halle Berry has vowed that she will not walk down the aisle with her partner, Gabriel Aubry, but is contemplating having another child with the model.        
	The twice-divorced actress, who has a 15-month-old daughter, Nahla, with Aubry, says that previous experiences have made her realise that no relationship lasts forever, reports the Daily Mail.        
	Im much clearer about what a relationship is, which is why I will never marry again. Gabriel and I have a great partnership and a lovely daughter. But I once was stupid enough to say, in a previous relationship, Im going to be with this person for ever, and realised, as I grew, that I dont know if for ever is possible, said the Academy winning actress.         
	The 43-year-old Berry who is considered one of the sexiest woman in Hollywood said that motherhood has changed her priorities for life. My priority had been myself for a long, long time, but now it will always be Nahla.

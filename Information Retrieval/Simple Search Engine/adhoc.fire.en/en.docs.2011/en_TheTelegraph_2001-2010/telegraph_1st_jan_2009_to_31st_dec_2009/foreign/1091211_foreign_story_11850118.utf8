The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Salahis get an invite they dont want
                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      Salahis get an invite they dont want
          JASON HOROWITZ                          Salahis: Summoned                                  
	Washington, Dec. 10: A congressional committee yesterday approved a motion to subpoena the fame-seeking Virginia couple who slipped past layers of security to shake President Obamas hand last month at the White House state dinner.        
	The House Committee on Homeland Security, which oversees the Secret Service and is planning a January 20 hearing into the state dinner breach, voted 26 to 3 to bring Tareq Salahi before the panel, and 27 to 2 to subpoena his wife, Michaele.        
	The committee then defeated an amendment proposed by Representative Peter King to force White House social secretary Desire Rogers to testify.        
	King argued, as he has for weeks, that the hearing would be incomplete without a fuller accounting of why Rogers decided to change years of policy, as King put it, and leave the Secret Service to solely take control of the guest list at security checkpoints on November 24, the night of the party. He argued that the change in procedure, which the White House has already said will not happen again, precipitated the security breakdown.        
	King also said that he and fellow Republicans on the committee had reached out to the White House to express their openness to an alternative method for Rogers to tell her story privately but had been shot down.        
	Secret Service director Mark Sullivan accepted blame in his testimony before the committee last week, and leading Democrats on the panel shielded Rogers from a subpoena, so the committee turned its focus wholly on the Salahis. But the couple wont have much to say.        
	The Salahis attorneys have said they will invoke the Fifth Amendment because they do not believe a fair hearing is possible in Thompsons committee. In yesterdays hearing, Thompson said those arguments were irrelevant and have no bearing on the committees oversight duties.        
	Representative Anh Joseph Cao found the whole hearing irrelevant.        
	This is so trivial, he said after the hearing, in which he voted against subpoenaing the Salahis and Rogers. We should get back to things that are important to the country.

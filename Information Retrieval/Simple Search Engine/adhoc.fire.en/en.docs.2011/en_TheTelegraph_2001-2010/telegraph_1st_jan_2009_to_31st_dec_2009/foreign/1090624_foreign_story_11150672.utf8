The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Jobs makes quiet return to work after transplant
                                                                                                               Jobs makes quiet return to work after transplant
                            
	London, June 23: Steve Jobs, the chief executive of Apple, appears to have made a quiet return to work after successfully recovering from a liver transplant.         
	 In a brief written statement released yesterday, Jobs spoke about the success of the iPhone 3G S launch last Friday, celebrating more than one million units already sold.         
	Customers are voting and the iPhone is winning... With over 50,000 applications available from Apples revolutionary App Store, iPhone momentum is stronger than ever, he said.         
	This is the first time Jobs has been quoted in an Apple statement since he took a medical leave of absence in January. The company has always said that he was due to come back to work at the end of June, and yesterday appears to have marked his gradual return.         
	Over the weekend, it was reported by the Wall Street Journal that Jobs had a liver transplant two months ago in Tennessee, though no sources were given and Apple did not comment.         
	This is the first time weve heard from Steve Jobs since he reported he was taking medical leave, said Oppenheimer amp; Co analyst Yair Reiner. Its a sign Apple has its CEO back.        
	Jobs first disclosed that he had health problems in an internal Apple memo on January 5, stating he had been suffering from a hormone imbalance.         
	In another memo a few days later he wrote that he had learned that my health-related issues are more complex than I originally thought and announced a six-month leave of absence until the end of June 2009 to allow him to better focus on his health.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Graft-hit leaders to stay, says PPP
                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      Graft-hit leaders to stay, says PPP
                              Malik: Party support                            
	Islamabad, Dec. 19 (AP): Pakistans ruling party leaders insisted today that they supported the President and would not oust other top government officials after the Supreme Court struck down an amnesty shielding them from corruption charges.        
	The Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) dismissed talk of any confrontation with the judiciary, but defiant moves by party leaders since Wednesdays sweeping  and popular  court ruling has so deepened the political turmoil that some analysts gave the government only months to survive in its current form.        
	During a critical meeting of the PPP leadership tonight, party officials told the media that they respected the courts and that accused members were prepared to face any charges.        
	The leaders said they had full confidence in President Asif Ali Zardari, who is constitutionally immune from prosecution in the graft cases against him. Mere accusations dont mean a person is proven guilty and on such a basis talk of resignations is not right, said Jahangir Badar, PPP secretary-general.        
	The leaders insisted that no cabinet minister affected by the loss of the amnesty would be asked to quit  even to improve the party image.         
	Aside from resisting calls for the ouster of cabinet ministers, the government has in recent days suspended officials who were carrying out court orders and elevated one party member named in a graft case to law minister. The moves came as anti-corruption courts issued summons to more than 100 suspects, while the interior ministry issued travel bans on 250.        
	Its not looking good for stability, said Cyril Almeida, an opinion writer for Dawn, a leading English-language newspaper. He ruled out a military coup  something Pakistan is prone to  but said the events have pitted the political leadership that currently controls the executive against the judiciary.        
	 Among the suspects summoned by anti-corruption courts are interior minister Rehman Malik  a figure seen as close to the US  and presidential secretary Salman Farooqi, court officials said.        
	Malik and defence minister Ahmed Mukhtar were among the 250 barred from leaving the country following the supreme courts decision.

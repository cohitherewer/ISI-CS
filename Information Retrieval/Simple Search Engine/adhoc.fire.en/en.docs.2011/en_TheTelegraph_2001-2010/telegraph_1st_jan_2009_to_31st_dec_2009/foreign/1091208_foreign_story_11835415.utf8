The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Moss buys bracelet from guest at wedding
                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      Moss buys bracelet from guest at wedding
                              Smitten                            
	New York, Dec. 7 (PTI): Supermodel Kate Moss was apparently impressed by a fellow guests bracelet at a recent wedding that she bought it off her straightaway.        
	The 35-year-old model was smitten with jewellery designer Ann Dexter-Joness accessory during a friends nuptials that she wanted it immediately, reports New York Post.        
	So Mosss friend and billionaire retailer Philip Green offered Ann a large sum of money for the bracelet.        
	She was so crazy to wear it so Sir Philip Green insisted Kate have it immediately and bought it for her right off my wrist, Ann said.         
	But Ann, who designed the black onyx, diamond, solid gold and silver bauble as part of her new jewellery line, wasnt too upset because as well as the money, Moss also gave her another bracelet to wear.         
	And Kate gave me her Chanel bracelet as a gift, so that my wrist wasnt bare, she added.

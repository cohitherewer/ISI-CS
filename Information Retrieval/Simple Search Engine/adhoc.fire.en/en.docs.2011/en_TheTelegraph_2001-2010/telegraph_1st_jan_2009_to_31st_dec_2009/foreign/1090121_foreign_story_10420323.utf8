The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Note for successor at Oval Office 
                                                                                                               Note for successor at Oval Office 
                            
	Washington, Jan. 20 (AP): George W. Bush left a note in the Oval Office for President-elect Barack Obama, wishing him well as he takes the reins of the executive branch and continuing a White House ritual.         
	The White House today declined to provide details of the message the two-term Republican left for the incoming Democrat, saying only that Bush wrote it yesterday and left it in the top drawer of his desk.        
	The theme is similar to what hes said since election night about the fabulous new chapter President-elect Obama is about to start, and that he wishes him the very best, White House press secretary Dana Perino said.        
	During his last moments in the Oval Office, former President Ronald Reagan scribbled a note for his successor on a notepad with a turkey insignia that said Dont let the turkeys get you down.        
	He, too, slipped the note in the presidential desk for his successor, George H.W. Bush.        
	Four years after that, the elder Bush left a note for Bill Clinton. And eight years after that, Clinton wrote a note for Bush, and included a copy of the message he had received from Bushs father.        
	Following Obamas inauguration, Bush and his wife Laura got on a helicopter stationed alongside the US Capitol. The new President and his wife walked them to the chopper  in keeping with tradition  to see them off.        
	The Bushes were first headed to Midland, Texas, for a homecoming celebration. Then they will go to their ranch in Crawford for their first night as private citizens again.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Saudi snub to Pervez
                                                                                                               Saudi snub to Pervez
  - King Abdullah refuses to play any part in Pak politics        NASIR JAFFRY                           Debris of the past                                        
	Islamabad, Sept 3: Pervez Musharraf returned empty-handed to London after King Abdullah of Saudi Arabia refused to bail out the former President over demands in Pakistan for his trial.        
	Musharraf is currently living in London as demands for his trial on treason charges for tampering with the Constitution grow at home.         
	Musharraf, who arrived in Jeddah two days ago on an aircraft that was sent by the the king, left on a commercial flight.        
	The Saudi king refused to play any part in Pakistani politics as he met Musharraf and asked him to clear up the issues on his own, a source told The Telegraph .         
	Former Pakistani Prime Minister and chief of the Pakistan Muslim League Nawaz Sharif, who was ousted in the October 1999 coup by Musharraf, has been demanding a trial of the former President on treason charges. However, top leaders in the ruling Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) have rejected the demand.         
	Prime Minister Yousaf Raza Gilani has already told the PML(N)-led Opposition that a trial was not doable while interior minister Rehman Malik described it as a debris of the past. He said that any such action was possible only if a unanimous resolution was passed by the parliament.         
	The Saudis also advised Musharraf to seek pardon and apologise to the people who had to suffer because of his actions during his days in power.         
	Musharrafs imposition of emergency rule and dismissal of 60 Supreme Court judges in November 2007 had angered the Pakistan people and major parties. However, he insisted that it was in the national interest.        
	Musharraf imposed emergency after he realised that the judiciary might overturn his controversial victory in the October 2006 presidential elections.         
	The former President contested that election while he was still the army chief.        
	The Pakistani media described Musharrafs visit to Saudi Arabia as a failure.         
	Musharraf has left Saudi Arabia without securing any success and it is expected that some other international friends of the former President could intervene to save his neck, The News said today.

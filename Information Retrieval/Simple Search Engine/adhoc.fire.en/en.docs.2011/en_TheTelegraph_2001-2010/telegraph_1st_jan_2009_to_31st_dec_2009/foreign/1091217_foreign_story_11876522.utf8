          OUR BUREAU AND PTI                          Maoist protesters in Kathmandu. (AP)                                  
	Kathmandu, Dec. 16: The Maoists today marched into the heavily-guarded Durbar Square in Kathmandu and declared that the Nepali capital was part of the Newa autonomous region.        
	Waving red flags, 5,000 Maoist cadres forced their way into the square where their chief, Prachanda, announced the Newa autonomous state. Other than Kathmandu, Newa also consists of Bhaktapur and Lalitpur districts.         
	The Maoists have ignored warnings from the Nepali Congress to stop their autonomous region programme as it may lead to social confrontation. Even though todays takeover of Durbar Square was symbolic, it still sent shockwaves in the ruling CPN-UML ruling alliance.         
	At the square, Prachanda lit a lamp and released a banner that said Newa autonomous region as hundreds of balloons were released. Our move is not intended to disrupt the peace process or block the Constitution-making task, Prachanda said.         
	Hari Roka, a pro-Maoist member of Nepals Constituent Assembly described todays Durbar Square event as stirring, but quickly added: There are more signs we are heading towards a big tussle, there is a total political deadlock and the public mood suggests it will have to be somehow broken. The Nepali Congress and other parties are refusing the discuss key issues, confrontation is bound to happen.         
	The three-day national bandh declared by the Maoists from December 20 could become the flashpoint for more frontal confrontation between party cadres and government forces.        
	Although the Maoist leadership maintains its bandh will be peaceful, elements within the party, especially the young, do not rule out clashes.         
	Asked whether the declaration of Kathmandu as autonomous Newa region itself could lead to a crisis, Roka said.         
	Maybe not, but the whole countrywide movement by Maoists is getting more and more tense. Maoists have so far declared eight such autonomous regions based on their nationality-based federal map. They are: Limbuan, Kosila, Kirat, Sherpa, Magarat, Seti-Mahakali, Lamabhote and Tamuwan.         
	The Maoist view of the future Nepali federation is the subject of a bitter internal debate, with many of their political adversaries arguing against nationality as a basis for carving new states.         
	Some political adversaries have also questioned the right of the Maoists to create such divisions when the Constituent Assembly has not even taken up the issue.

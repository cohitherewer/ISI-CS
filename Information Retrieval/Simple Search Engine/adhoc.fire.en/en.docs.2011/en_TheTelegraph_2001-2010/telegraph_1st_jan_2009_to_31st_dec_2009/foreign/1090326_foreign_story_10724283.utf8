The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Obamas new crisis tone
                                                                                                               Obamas new crisis tone

	Washington, March 25: For just under an hour last night, Americans saw not the fiery and inspirational speaker who riveted the nation in his address to Congress last month, or the conversational President who warmly engaged Americans in talks across the country, or even the jaunty and jokey President who turned up on Jay Leno.        
	Instead, in his second prime-time news conference from the White House, it was Barack Obama the lecturer, a familiar character from early in the campaign.        
	 Placid and unsmiling, he was the professor-in-chief, offering familiar arguments in long paragraphs  often introduced with the phrase, as I said before  sounding like the teacher speaking in the stillness of a classroom where students are restlessly waiting for the ring of the bell.        
	The session in the East Room came at a volatile moment for the new President as he sought to quell Democratic misgivings about his ambitious economic agenda and deflect strong Republican opposition. Speaking past the reporters in the room to the tens of millions of viewers tuning in at home, he tried to reassure the nation that he could solve the crisis that has gripped the economy for more than a year.         
	Were beginning to see signs of progress, he said, calling for a renewed confidence that a better day will come.         
	As senators from his own party began carving some of the signature proposals out of his budget, Obama signalled that he could compromise in the short term on a middle-class tax cut and a cap on carbon emissions. But he indicated that he would stand firm on four top priorities, insisting that Congress make progress in those areas.        
	We never expected when we printed out our budget that they would simply Xerox it and vote on it, Obama said, expressing flexibility about the details as long as his central goals were met. The bottom line is that I want to see health care, energy, education and serious efforts to reduce our budget deficit.        
	At a time of anger and anxiety in the country, Obama showed little emotion. He rarely cracked a joke or raised his voice. Even when he declared himself upset over the $165 million in bonuses paid this month by the American International Group despite its taxpayer bailout, his voice sounded calm and unbothered.         
	To a certain extent, Obamas demeanour could have been calculated  an effort, aides said, to lower the temperature after a supercharged week and nudge the country towards what Obama considers the more pressing issues of fixing the banking system and reviving the economy.         
	Even after excoriating the AIG executives, he cautioned that the rest of us cant afford to demonise every investor or entrepreneur who seeks to make a profit.        
	The only time he seemed irritated came when he was asked why the attorney general of New York, Andrew M. Cuomo, seemed to have more success getting AIG executives to return some bonuses than his own administration.         
	Pressed on why he did not express outrage immediately upon learning of the bonuses, Obama said sharply: Well, it took us a couple of days because I like to know what Im talking about before I speak.

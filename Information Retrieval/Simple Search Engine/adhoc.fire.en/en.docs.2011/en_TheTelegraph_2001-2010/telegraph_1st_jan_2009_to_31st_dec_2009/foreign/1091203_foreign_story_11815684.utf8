          SHERYL GAY STOLBERG AND HELENE COOPER                          Obama with cadets after addressing the nation on Afghanistan at the US Military Academy in West Point, New York. (AFP)                                        
	West Point (New York), Dec. 2: President Obama announced today that he would speed 30,000 additional troops to Afghanistan in the coming months.        
	However, he vowed to start bringing American forces home in the middle of 2011, saying the US could not afford and should not have to shoulder an open-ended commitment.        
	Promising that he could bring this war to a successful conclusion, Obama set out a strategy that would seek to reverse Taliban gains in large parts of Afghanistan, better protect the Afghan people, increase the pressure on Afghanistan to build its own military capacity and a more effective government and step up attacks on al Qaida in Pakistan.        
	America, we are passing through a time of great trial, Obama said. And the message that we send in the midst of these storms must be clear: that our cause is just, our resolve unwavering.        
	The military escalation Obama described and defended in his speech to a national television audience and 4,000 cadets at the US Military Academy here, the culmination of a review that lasted three months, could well prove to be the most consequential decision of Obamas presidency.        
	In his 33-minute address, he sought to convince an increasingly sceptical nation that the resurgence of the Taliban in Afghanistan and the continued existence of al Qaida across the border in Pakistan  what he called a cancer on the region  were direct threats to the US. He could achieve the seemingly contradictory goals of expanding American involvement in the war even as he sought to bring it to a close.        
	The scene in the hall was striking and sombre: row after row of cadets, in their blue-grey uniforms, listening intently to a strategy that could put many of them in harms way.         
	If I did not think that the security of the United States and the safety of the American people were at stake in Afghanistan, I would gladly order every single one of our troops home tomorrow, Obama said. So no, I do not make this decision lightly. He called on foreign allies to step up their commitment, declaring: This is not just Americas war.        
	He delivered a pointed message to Hamid Karzai, the President of Afghanistan, saying: The days of providing a blank cheque are over.        
	Addressing critics who have likened Afghanistan to Vietnam, Obama called the comparison a false reading of history. And he spoke directly to the American people about the tough road ahead.        
	Let me be clear: none of this will be easy, Obama said. The struggle against violent extremism will not be finished quickly, and it extends well beyond Afghanistan and Pakistan. It will be an enduring test of our free society, and our leadership in the world.        
	With the economy weak and the issue of jobs foremost on Americans minds, the President conceded that the new strategy would carry an expensive price tag, which he put at an additional $30 billion in the first year. Yet with some Democrats talking of a war surcharge, Obama offered no details of how he intended to pay for his new policy, saying only that he was committed to addressing these costs openly and honestly.        
	White House advisers said they expected the administration would do so in the coming weeks, as officials, including secretary of defence Robert M. Gates and secretary of state Hillary Rodham Clinton, testify on Capitol Hill.        
	The approach laid out by Obama  not so much a new strategy as a doubling down on the one he embraced earlier this year  incorporated the basic goals and came close to the force levels proposed in the counterinsurgency plan that General Stanley A. McChrystal, the top military commander in Afghanistan, put forward in September.

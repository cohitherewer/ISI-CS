	Enrique blast    
	 London, March 13: A mother blasted out Enrique Iglesias songs so loud that they could be heard 100 metres away from her home, a court heard, reports The Daily Telegraph.       
	Paula Green, 38, claimed she never played her music as loudly as her daughter Carla, 18, who had Eurodance artist Basshunter blaring out at an unacceptably high volume.      
	But Green was fined 505 and her daughter 190 at separate hearings before Doncaster magistrates after they admitted breaching noise abatement orders.

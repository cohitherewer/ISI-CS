The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Shaky Pak vulnerable to Qaida plots

	Washington, May 11: Foreign operatives of the al Qaida, who had focused on plotting attacks against the West, are seizing on the turmoil to sow chaos in Pakistan and strengthen the hand of militant Islamist groups there, according to American and Pakistani intelligence officials.         
	One indication came on April 19, when a truck parked inside a Qaida compound in South Waziristan erupted in a fireball when it was struck by a CIA missile.         
	American intelligence officials say that the truck had been loaded with high explosives, apparently to be used as a bomb, and that while its ultimate target remains unclear, the bomb would have been more devastating than the suicide bombing that killed more than 50 people at the Marriott Hotel in Islamabad in September.         
	Al Qaidas leaders  a predominantly Arab group of Egyptians, Saudis and Yemenis, as well as other nationalities like Uzbeks  for years have nurtured ties to Pakistani militant groups like the Taliban operating in the mountains of Pakistan. The foreign operatives have historically set their sights on targets loftier than those selected by the local militant groups, aiming for spectacular attacks against the West, but they may see new opportunity in the recent violence.        
	Intelligence officials say the Taliban advances in Swat and Buner, which are closer to Islamabad than to the tribal areas, have already helped al Qaida in its recruiting efforts. The officials say the groups recruiting campaign is currently aimed at young fighters across West Asia, North Africa and Central Asia who are less inclined to plan and carry out far-reaching global attacks.        
	They smell blood, and they are intoxicated by the idea of a jihadist takeover in Pakistan, said Bruce . Riedel, a former analyst for the CIA who recently led the Obama administrations policy review of Pakistan and Afghanistan.         
	It remains unlikely that Islamic militants could seize power in Pakistan, given the strength of Pakistans military, according to American intelligence analysts.         
	But a senior American intelligence official expressed concern that recent successes by the Taliban in extending territorial gains could foreshadow the creation of mini-Afghanistans around Pakistan.         
	American government officials and terrorism experts said that al Qaidas increasing focus on a local strategy was partly born from necessity, as the CIAs intensifying airstrikes have reduced the groups ability to hit targets in the West.         
	The US has conducted 16 drone strikes so far this year, according to American officials, compared with 36 strikes in all of 2008.         
	According to a Pakistani intelligence assessment provided to The New York Times in February, the al Qaida has adapted to the deaths of its leaders by shifting to conduct decentralised operations under small but well-organised regional groups.

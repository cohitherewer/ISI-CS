The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Indian on Obama team list
                                                                                                               Indian on Obama team list
          K.P. NAYAR                              
	Washington, Jan. 7: When Barack Obama makes history in less than two weeks, becoming the first black man to be US President, a few miles from his swearing-in on the Capitol, an Indian-American is expected to enter the history books of America, albeit on a smaller scale.         
	If Obamas plans go on schedule, Sanjay Gupta, CNNs chief medical correspondent, will prepare to take over one of the more hallowed institutions of the American establishment: the Office of the Surgeon General.         
	As head of Americas Public Health Service Commissioned Corps and as the chief spokesman of the US government on matters of public health, the Surgeon General holds the rank of a three-star vice admiral.         
	Since the office was created in March 1871, the navy has zealously guarded the post as part of its turf. If confirmed by the US Senate, Sanjay Gupta will be only the second civilian to become Surgeon General of this country in 137 years.         
	A third civilian served as acting Surgeon General for eight months in 1981, but was not confirmed in office and had to make way for a uniformed vice admiral.         
	For this reason, Guptas nomination has drawn criticism from the uniformed commissioned health corps even before it has been formally announced. quot;I am unaware of any public health experience or qualifications he (Gupta) has to be the leader of the nations public health service, quot; Gerard Farrell, executive director of the public health services Commissioned Officers Association, told The Washington Post.        
	 quot;This would be akin to appointing the Army Chief of Staff from the City Council of Hoboken, quot; a town in New Jersey.         
	Needless to add, Gupta will be the first Indian American to hold the job. By a quirk of irony the outgoing president, George W Bush offered the job of Surgeon General to an Indian American when he first came to the White House in 2001.         
	Although the nomination was never announced in public, Bush tried to persuade a family friend, Bush fund-raiser and active Republican, Zach Zachariah from Kerala, to take the job. But Zachariah, who has a thriving practice in Florida as a cardiologist, turned down the prestigious job. The surgeon generals job fetches a maximum annual salary of $196,700.         
	Like Zachariah, the incoming administrations choice for the post stands to lose a pile of money if he becomes Surgeon General.         
	Gupta has lucrative television contracts with CNN and CBS. His is a household name in America because of the popular programme he hosts on CNN, quot;House Call quot;.         
	In October Gupta aired a special report called quot;Fit to Lead, quot; which examined the health of the presidential nominees in the 2008 election. As a result, Gupta will know intimate details of Obamas health more than anyone in the next White House, barring his personal physicians.         
	A month after the programme was aired, on November 25, Gupta met Obama for more than two hours in Chicago, when he was offered the job. In addition to being Surgeon General, Gupta will also get a top post in the new White House Office of Health Reform.         
	A White House presence will make Gupta the most influential Surgeon General in history, if he is confirmed by the Senate. Guptas parents moved to the US from India in the 1960s to work as engineers at Ford Motor Company in Michigan. His mother Damayanti was the first woman engineer hired by Ford. Because the parents originally belonged to a part of India that is now in Pakistan, the US media initially reported that Gupta was half Indian and half Pakistani, provoking a fusillade of protest from the Indian American community.         
	Late last evening, Damayanti Gupta told the South Asian Journalists Association here that quot;Sanjay Gupta is 100 percent Indian, no Pakistani. quot;

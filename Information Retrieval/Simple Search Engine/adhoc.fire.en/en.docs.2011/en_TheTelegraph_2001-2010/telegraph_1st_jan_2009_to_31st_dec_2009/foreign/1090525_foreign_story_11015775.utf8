The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Royal driver suspended
                                                                                                               Royal driver suspended
                            
	London, May 24 (Reuters): Buckingham Palace said today it had suspended a royal chauffeur alleged to have let undercover journalists enter Queen Elizabeths London residence and sit in her car in return for a bribe.        
	News of The World, a tabloid, said two of its reporters posing as West Asian businessmen paid 1,000 to the chauffeur to evade security checks at the palace. The paper said the story exposed lax security at the palace. We could have been al Qaida, we could have had a bomb or at least a tracking device, it said.

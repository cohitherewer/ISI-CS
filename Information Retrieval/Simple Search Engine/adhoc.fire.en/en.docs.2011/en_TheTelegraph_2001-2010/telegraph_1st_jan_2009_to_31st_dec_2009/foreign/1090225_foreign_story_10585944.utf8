The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Taliban in indefinite Swat truce
                                                                                                               Taliban in indefinite Swat truce
                            
	Mingora (Pakistan), Feb. 24 (Reuters): Pakistani Taliban militants announced today an indefinite ceasefire in the Swat valley in the northwest of the country, a day after the army said it was ceasing operations in the region.        
	In the neighbouring Bajaur region on the Afghan border, the government announced a four-day ceasefire in response to a unilateral truce called by militants there yesterday.        
	The indefinite ceasefire in Swat follows an agreement by authorities to enforce Islamic sharia law in the valley, which until 2007 was one of Pakistans prime tourist destinations. A 10-day truce announced in response to the agreement on sharia law had been made permanent, said a Taliban spokesman in the valley, 120km northwest of Islamabad. We have agreed on an indefinite ceasefire, said the spokesman, Muslim Khan. He said the Taliban in the valley, led by cleric Fazlullah, also decided to release three persons.

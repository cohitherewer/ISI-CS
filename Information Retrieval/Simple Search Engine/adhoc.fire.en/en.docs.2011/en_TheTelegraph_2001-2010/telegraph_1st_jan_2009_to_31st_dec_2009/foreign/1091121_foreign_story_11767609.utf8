	London, Nov. 20: Stroking a pet can help patients cut their amount of painkillers in half, according to a new study.        
	The research found that patients who had undergone hip or knee replacement operations needed less painkillers if they used pet therapy. It is well known that animal owners are generally healthier than non-pet owners because they can help reduce stress.        
	 In Britain a charity has been taking animals into hospitals and childrens wards to help patients recover.

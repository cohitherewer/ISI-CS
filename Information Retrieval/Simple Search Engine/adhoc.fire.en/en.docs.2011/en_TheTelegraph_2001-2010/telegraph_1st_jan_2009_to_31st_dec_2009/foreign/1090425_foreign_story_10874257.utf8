The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Flu kills 61 in Mexico, spreads to America 
                                                                                                               Flu kills 61 in Mexico, spreads to America 
                            
	Mexico City, April 24 (Reuters): A deadly strain of flu never seen before has killed as many as 61 people in Mexico and has spread into the US, where eight people were reported ill.        
	Mexicos government said today that at least 16 people have died of the disease in central Mexico and that it may also have been responsible for 45 other deaths.        
	The World Health Organisation (WHO) said genetic tests of the virus in 12 of the Mexican victims had the same genetic structure as a new strain of swine flu, designated H1N1, seen in seven people in California and Texas.        
	Because there is clearly human-to-human spread of the new virus, raising fears of a major outbreak, Mexicos government cancelled classes for millions of children in its sprawling capital city and surrounding areas. It is a virus that mutated from pigs and then at some point was transmitted to humans, health minister Jose Angel Cordova said.        
	It first looked mostly like a swine virus but closer analysis showed it is a never-before-seen mixture of swine, human and avian viruses, according to the US Centres for Disease Control and Prevention.        
	Humans can occasionally catch swine flu from pigs but rarely have they been known to pass it on to other people.        
	White House alert        
	The north lawn of the White House and parts of the US Capitol were briefly evacuated today after the pilot of a small plane strayed into restricted airspace. Proper procedures were followed. The pilot was compliant. It is over, a spokeswoman said.

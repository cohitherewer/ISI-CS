                                                                                                               30 dead in Kandahar explosions
                            
	Kabul, Aug. 25 (Reuters): At least 30 people were killed in a series of car bomb blasts close to the offices of foreign aid and development agencies in the southern Afghan city of Kandahar today, hospital officials and police said.        
	A doctor at Kandahar city hospital said 13 people were also wounded. Civilians and police were among the dead and wounded, he said.        
	The blast comes five days after disputed presidential elections which were marked by poor voter turnout in the south after the Taliban vowed to disrupt the poll violently.         
	A police source in Kandahar said bombs planted in five stationary cars went off simultaneously near a building housing Canadian International Development Agency offices.         
	A spokeswoman for the Canadian embassy said they were checking the reports.

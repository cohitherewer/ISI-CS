The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Pak: No blank cheque to US
                                                                                                               Pak: No blank cheque to US
          NASIR JAFFRY                           Qureshi                                  
	Islamabad, April 7: Pakistani foreign minister Shah Mehmood Qureshi today refused to give a blank cheque to the US and admitted, for the first time, that there are differences with America over anti-terror policies.        
	US envoy Richard Holbrooke and Admiral Mike Mullen of the US Joint Chiefs of Staff were visiting Pakistan on the heels of President Barack Obamas announcement of plans to reinvigorate the war in Afghanistan by sending more troops to the region and boosting aid to Pakistan to help it stave off al Qaida and Taliban-led militancy on its soil.        
	We did talk about drones and let me be very frank. There is a difference of view... there is a gap between us and them, and I want to bridge that gap through continued talks, foreign minister Shah Mehmood Qureshi said during a joint news conference with Holbrooke and Mullen in Islamabad.         
	Qureshi said both US and Pakistan are partners in the war on terror and there is no other way but to trust and respect each other.         
	But neither will Pakistan issue a blank cheque to US nor will it expect the same from Washington, he said.         
	The foreign minister made it clear that his country would also not allow any foreign force to land on its soil and carry out operations against the militants.         
	It is totally unacceptable to us, the foreign minister stressed.         
	A wave of suicide attacks and bomb blasts, which observers believe is in reaction to Pakistans blind support to the US anti-terror policy, has killed more than 1,600 people across the country since January 2007.

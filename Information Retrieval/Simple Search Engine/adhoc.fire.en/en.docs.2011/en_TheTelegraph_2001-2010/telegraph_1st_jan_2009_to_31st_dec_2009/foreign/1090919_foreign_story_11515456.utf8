The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Hawks, liberals clash in Tehran
                                                                                                               Hawks, liberals clash in Tehran
  - Ahmadinejad says Holocaust a myth        ROBERT F. WORTH                          An Opposition protester in Tehran. (Reuters)                                        
	Beirut, Sept. 18: Irans government and its relentlessly defiant critics used an annual day of support for Palestinians today to promote their agendas, with tens of thousands of protesters taking to the streets in their largest rally in two months.        
	Also today, President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad raised the stakes against Israel and called the Holocaust a lie.        
	Ahmadinejad  who has been trying to silence critics for months  was quoted by several reports as saying that the Holocaust was a false pretext for the establishment of Israel in 1948.         
	Through a tumultuous day of street rallies, police were often on the sidelines as protesters faced off against huge crowds of pro-government supporters  many of them bused in from outside the cities  and chain-wielding Basij militia men.         
	There were reports of arrests in Tehran and the southern city of Shiraz. However, there were no shootings or deaths, with the police apparently showing greater restraint than at earlier protests.        
	Conservatives had warned against using the annual pro-Palestinian march, known as Quds Day, as an excuse for renewed protests against Ahmadinejad. But the protesters turned out anyway, often walking alongside larger groups of state-sanctioned marchers bearing huge banners denouncing Israel. The protesters even flouted Irans support for pro-Palestinian militants, chanting No to Gaza and Lebanon, my life is for Iran.

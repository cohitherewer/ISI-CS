The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | 3 shots that ended hostage crisis
                                                                                                               3 shots that ended hostage crisis
          ROBERT D. MCFADDEN AND SCOTT SHANE                        Captain Richard Phillips				                                 
	New York, April 13: Three remarkable shots  one each by snipers firing from a distance at dusk, using night-vision scopes, ended the US hostage crisis off Somalia.        
	Acting with President Barack Obamas authorisation and in the belief that the hostage, Captain Richard Phillips, was in imminent danger of being killed by captors armed with pistols and AK-47s, snipers on the fantail of the destroyer Bainbridge, which was towing the lifeboat on a 100-foot line, opened fire and picked off the three captors.        
	Two of the captors had poked their heads out of a rear hatch of the lifeboat, exposing themselves to clear shots, and the third could be seen through a window in the bow, pointing an automatic rifle at the captain, who was tied up inside the 18-foot lifeboat, senior navy officials said.         
	That was it: the provocation that fulfilled the Presidents order to act only if the captains life was in imminent danger, and the opportunity of having clear shots at each captor. The on-screen command gave the order to fire. Senior defence officials, themselves marvelling at the skill of the snipers, said each took a target and fired one shot.        
	This was an incredible team effort. I am extremely proud of the tireless efforts of all the men and women who made this rescue possible, Vice-Admiral William E. Gortney, commander of the US naval forces in the region, said in Bahrain.        
	Within minutes of the snipers taking the shots, rescuers slid down ropes from the Bainbridge, climbed aboard the lifeboat and found the three pirates dead. They then untied Phillips, ending the contretemps at sea that had riveted much of the worlds attention. A fourth pirate had surrendered earlier.         
	Shortly after his rescue, Phillips was taken aboard the Bainbridge, underwent a medical exam and was found to be in relatively good condition for a 53-year-old seafarer who had been held since Wednesday by pirates who had demanded $2 million for his life. He called home and was flown to the Boxer, an amphibious assault ship also off the Somali coast. Arrangements were being made for his return home to Vermont.        
	I share the countrys admiration for the bravery of Captain Phillips and his selfless concern for his crew, Obama said. His courage is a model for all Americans.        
	Jubilation over the dramatic rescue reached from the White House to Underhill, Vermont, Phillipss hometown, and from personnel aboard the Bainbridge to the cheering, fist-pumping 19-member crew of the captains cargo ship, the Maersk Alabama, docked in Mombasa, Kenya.        
	Phillips, who was said to be resting comfortably, spoke to officials of the Maersk Line, who quoted him as saying: The real heroes are the navy, the Seals, those who have brought me home.         
	He also spoke to his wife, Andrea, and two college-aged children in Underhill, where dozens of yellow ribbons fluttered on the white picket fence of his home and two small American flags jutted up from the lawn.         
	This is truly a very happy Easter for the Phillips family, said Alison McColl, a Maersk representative assigned to speak for the family. They are all just so happy and relieved, she said. On the familys behalf, McColl thanked the nation and the people of Vermont for their prayers and support. Obviously, this has been a long journey for the family, she said.         
	While the outcome was a triumph for America, officials in many countries plagued by pirates said it was not likely to discourage them. Pirates are holding a dozen ships with more than 200 crew members, according to the Malaysia-based International Maritime Bureau.        
	Attack on US plane        
	Somalias militant Islamist rebel group al Shabaab said today it fired mortars at a plane carrying a US lawmaker, a day after navy snipers killed three Somali pirates.        
	An al Shabaab spokesman said his group fired at the plane carrying Representative Donald Payne as he left Somalia following a rare one-day visit by a US official. Paynes plane took off safely and no-one was hurt.

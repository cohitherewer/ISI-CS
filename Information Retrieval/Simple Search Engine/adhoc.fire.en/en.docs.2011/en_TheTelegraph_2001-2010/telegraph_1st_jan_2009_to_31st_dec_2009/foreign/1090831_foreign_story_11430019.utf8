The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Pak blast kills trainee cops
                                                                                                               Pak blast kills trainee cops
          NASIR JAFFRY                               
	Islamabad, Aug. 30: A suicide bomber blew himself up at a police training ground in Pakistans restive Swat Valley today, killing at least 14 trainees, a month after the military claimed it had cleared the area of Taliban militants.         
	The attack came three days after a suicide blast in the Khyber tribal region killed 22 policemen.         
	The trainee policemen were busy with the morning drills when the suicide bomber, disguised as a recruit, entered the ground and blew himself up, local administration and police officers said.         
	A police officer said on condition of anonymity that the bomber wore the black uniform of a trainee.         
	Most of the trainees are retired military personnel who have recently been recruited to assist the provincial police in fighting militancy in the North West Frontier Province.         
	I can confirm that the attack has left 14 policemen dead, police chief Qazi Ghulam Farooq said, adding that Taliban militants were behind the attack.         
	Police and security personnel began patrolling streets in Swat after the attack and businessmen downed shutters.         
	Local authorities clamped a curfew in Mingora, the main town of the Swat Valley, which was once known as the Switzerland of Pakistan for its beauty.         
	At least 22 police officers were killed on Thursday in a suicide attack in the Khyber tribal region near the Afghan border.         
	Thursdays attack was the deadliest assault on security personnel since the Taliban declared that their chief, Baitullah Mehsud, had been killed in a US missile strike on August 5.         
	Analysts believe that the Tehreek-e-Taliban, an outfit Mehsud formed in 2007, would carry out attacks to try to assert itself and ward off the impression that it is in disarray.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | BBC Brown slur
                                                                                                               BBC Brown slur
                            
	London, Feb. 6 (Reuters): BBC Top Gear presenter Jeremy Clarkson apologised today for calling British Prime Minister Gordon Brown a one-eyed Scottish idiot at a news conference in Australia.        
	The outspoken, highly paid presenter drew criticism from a leading charity and Scottish parliamentarians after making the comments in Sydney where he is promoting Top Gear Live, a stage version of the international hit TV show. In the heat of the moment I made a remark about the Prime Ministers personal appearance for which, upon reflection, I apologise, he said. Clarkson was comparing Browns handling of the deepening financial crisis with that of Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd when he made the comments.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Jets bomb Swat areas, rise in exodus

	Islamabad, May 8: A day after Prime Minister Yousaf Raza Gilani vowed to eliminate the Taliban militants who have taken over large parts of the country, Pakistani warplanes were reported today strafing targets in the contested Swat Valley northwest of the capital.        
	At the same time, concerns over vast displacements of civilians were rising sharply. International relief agencies in Geneva said that reports from provincial authorities and the Pakistani government indicated that up to half a million people had been uprooted by the latest upsurge in violence, adding to a similar number already displaced by conflict in the area.         
	It is not possible to independently confirm such reports, given that reporters and aid agencies are blocked from the conflict area and a comprehensive survey of the areas beyond  rough terrain, with little infrastructure  is impossible.         
	Ron Redmond, a spokesman for the UN high commissioner for refugees in Geneva, said the authorities had established three new tented camps to absorb some of the people travelling in rickshaws, cars, small trucks and buses. Most carry little more than the clothes on their backs.        
	Today, helicopter gunships, fighter planes and troops were all involved in operations in Swat, Reuters reported, quoting Major Nasir Khan, a military spokesman in the valley as saying up to 12 militants were killed after as many as 55 were killed the previous day. Since Wednesday, the Pakistani authorities have claimed to have killed over 100 militants, but the assertions are difficult to verify in part because reporters are barred from the conflict zone.         
	In a nationally televised address yesterday, Gilani said: To restore the honour and dignity of our homeland and to protect our people, the armed forces have been called in to eliminate the militants and terrorists.        
	We will not bow before extremists and terrorists, he said, publicly declaring a get-tough strategy that American officials have been urging on him since he took office last year. Islamic militants have taken control of three districts northwest of Islamabad, including Swat, where, Gilani said, the militants had reneged on a peace deal signed in February and had no one to blame but themselves.        
	The militants have waged war against all segments of society, Gilani said. I regret to say that our bona fide intention to prefer reconciliation with them was perceived as a weakness on our part.        
	The AP reported today that tens of thousands people remained in Mingora, the main city of Swat, and some said the Taliban was preventing them from leaving.        
	Gilanis speech appeared to reflect a break with the Taliban, who have been supported by elements of the Pakistan military and intelligence services since the mid-1990s. That support, which has been provided covertly, has enraged a succession of American leaders, who have helped give Pakistans military more than $1 billion a year since 2001.

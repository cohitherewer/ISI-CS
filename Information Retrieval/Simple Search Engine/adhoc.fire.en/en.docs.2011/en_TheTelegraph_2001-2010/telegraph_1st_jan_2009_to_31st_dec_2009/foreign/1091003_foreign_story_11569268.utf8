The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | DAddario: Silvio knew I was prostitute

          NICK SQUIRES                          Patrizia DAddario                                  
	Rome, Oct. 2: The call girl who allegedly slept with Silvio Berlusconi has claimed that the Prime Minister was well aware that she was a prostitute.        
	Patrizia DAddarios claims that she had sex with the Prime Minister at the end of a party at his mansion in Rome last November have dogged Berlusconi, 73, for months.        
	The Premier knew that I was an escort, DAddario said in a live television interview last night. I spent the whole night with him and everyone there knew that I was an escort. He knew too.        
	DAddario said she attended two parties at Berlusconis residence, at both of which glamorous young women in black dresses outnumbered men.        
	The male guests included Gianpaolo Tarantini, a Bari-based businessman who says he recruited more than 30 models and actresses for the Prime Ministers private parties and is being investigated for allegedly procuring prostitutes and dealing in cocaine.        
	To me it seemed like a harem, DAddario, 42, told a current affairs programme on a channel run by public broadcaster RAI.         
	There was the Prime Minister and Gianpaolo Tarantini and then more than 20 girls. We danced, we sang.        
	DAddario was interviewed on a live videolink by a journalist in Bari, with her face projected onto huge screens in a studio in Rome. She repeated claims, made to The Daily Telegraph during an interview in August, that there were other prostitutes present at the two dinners she attended. I was not the only escort, she said.        
	DAddario said she had used her mobile phone to record pictures and audio of her encounter with Berlusconi in order to protect herself, not to blackmail the billionaire media mogul. She said she never intended that details of the purported encounter should be made public, but that she had to turn over the audio recordings when questioned about the affair by prosecutors in Bari.        
	Berlusconi, 73, has not denied spending the night with the 42-year-old, but she directly contradicted his previous statements that he did not know that she or any of the other women who attended his parties were expensive prostitutes.        
	Even the other girls knew that I was to stay there that night. Everyone knew that I was an escort, she said.        
	Berlusconi spokesman Paolo Bonaiuti said the shows assertions were built around gossip and peeping through a keyhole.         
	The show ended just before midnight but dominated the front pages of nearly all Italian newspapers this morning.

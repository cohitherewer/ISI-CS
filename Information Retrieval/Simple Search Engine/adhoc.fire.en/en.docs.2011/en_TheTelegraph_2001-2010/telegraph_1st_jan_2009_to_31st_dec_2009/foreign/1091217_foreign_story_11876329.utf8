                              Gaider                            
	Moscow, Dec. 16 (Reuters): Yegor Gaidar, architect of the tumultuous reforms that helped cement Russias post-Soviet transition but drove many into poverty, died today. He was 53.        
	As the late President Yeltsins reform commissar, Gaidar provoked both awe and anger for helping to dismantle an economic system by freeing prices in 1992. His reforms devalued the savings of millions of Russians and gave the oligarchs the chance to grab the assets of a former superpower.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Imported Indian pipes anger US steel town
                                                                                                               Imported Indian pipes anger US steel town
          LOUIS UCHITELLE                          A steel mill in Granite City, Illinois                                  
	Granite City (Illinois), April 16: Jeff Rains, a retired steelworker at the sprawling mill here, made the discovery.         
	Out walking a month ago, he waited impatiently at a rail crossing while a freight train slowly passed, its flatbed cars stacked with steel pipes, each wide enough for a child to crawl through. Then he noticed Made in India stenciled on the pipes.        
	That observation has made him a Paul Revere in the eyes of many townspeople. Hundreds of sections of imported steel pipe have been moving into Granite City for use in an oil pipeline. The steel mill, meanwhile, has been shut since December for lack of orders  the first time in its 130-year history  and nearly 2,000 workers are on furlough.         
	I was very mad when I saw they were imported; I wondered why this pipe had not been made in the United States, said Rains, who is 61. Once the train passed, Rains, still active in union affairs, hastened to the union hall to spread the word.         
	The United Steelworkers union has been trying ever since to galvanise the Granite City story into national outrage over steel imports, raising suggestions of protectionism in the process.         
	With the economy in tatters, top corporate executives often state privately that they fear this downturn will fuel public sentiment against foreign-made products. Indeed, in February  before Rains made his discovery  5,000 people marched through the streets of this steel town in support of a strong Buy America clause in the $787 billion stimulus bill then before Congress.        
	The imported pipe has inflamed that sentiment. The union filed an anti-dumping lawsuit in Washington last Wednesday against tubular and pipe steel imported from China. A day earlier, Local 1899 staged a rally here, drawing more than 500 people to the same field where the lengths of Indian pipe, as the people here call them, have been stacked.         
	The steel pipe behind us is a symbol of what has gone wrong in this country, one of the speakers declared, arguing in effect that a lax Congress and greedy businesspeople, as in Wall Street, had brought three months of layoff, so far, to more than 10 per cent of Granite Citys work force. The crowd cheered.        
	The unions hope is that the Indian pipe episode will provoke a broad outcry, and similar finger-pointing, forcing Congress to tighten trade rules and pressuring companies that import steel to buy more from domestic suppliers instead.        
	The United Steelworkers assert that free trade is not the issue. The unions leaders endorse that, as do the chief executives of nearly every multinational company. What the Indian pipe represents, the union argues  and it is joined in this by steel industry executives  is a violation of fair trade.         
	They contend that generous government subsidies allow Indian and Chinese manufacturers to dump steel in this country at prices below the fair market value.         
	Other countries point the finger at the US and say we are protectionist, said Nancy Gravatt, a spokeswoman for the American Iron and Steel Institute, and then you look at the details in the other countries, and they are not playing by the rules at all.        
	Such strong language aside, the episode here has not generated the broad public outcry of, say, the bonuses paid by AIG. That is perhaps because trade issues do not generate the same reaction as huge Wall Street bonuses, and perhaps because the steelworkers themselves, as they explained in interviews here, would not have objected to the Indian steel if they were still fully employed at US Steels Granite City Works.

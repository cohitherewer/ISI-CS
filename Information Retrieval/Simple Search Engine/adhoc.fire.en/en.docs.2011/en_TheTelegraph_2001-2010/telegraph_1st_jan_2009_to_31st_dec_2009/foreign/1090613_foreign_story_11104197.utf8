The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Close race as Iranians vote
                                                                                                               Close race as Iranians vote

	Tehran, June 12 (Reuters): Iranians streamed to polling stations today in a hotly contested election and allies of hardline President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad and his main moderate challenger issued rival victory claims.        
	Sadegh Kharazi, a senior supporter of former Prime Minister Mirhossein Mousavi, said surveys made by reformers showed that Mousavi was getting about 58-60 per cent of the votes.        
	But Ahmadinejads representative at a supervisory body, Ali Asghar Zarei, said the incumbent was ahead with about the same level of support, the semi-official Mehr News Agency reported.        
	Due to heavy turnout, voting was extended by four hours to 1730GMT to allow more people to cast ballots, the interior ministry said.        
	Long queues had formed at voting centres and officials said they expected a turnout of about 70 per cent or more, approaching the record of nearly 80 per cent when reformist Mohammad Khatami swept the 1997 presidential election.        
	Some people said they had waited for more than two hours to cast ballots, both in northern, affluent areas of Tehran where Mousavi draws support and in southern, poorer neighbourhoods seen as Ahmadinejad strongholds.        
	High turnout could indicate voting by many pro-reformers who stayed away when Ahmadinejad won four years ago on a pledge to revive the values of the 1979 Islamic revolution.         
	A victory for Mousavi might help ease tensions with the West, which is concerned about Tehrans nuclear ambitions, and improve chances of engagement with President Barack Obama who has talked about a new start in ties with Tehran.        
	The vote has generated interest around the world with policymakers looking for signs of a change of approach by Tehran, whose ties with the West worsened under Ahmadinejad.         
	Obama hopeful        
	In Washington, President Barack Obama said he was hopeful the robust debate taking place in Irans election would advance his administrations efforts to engage Tehran in new ways.

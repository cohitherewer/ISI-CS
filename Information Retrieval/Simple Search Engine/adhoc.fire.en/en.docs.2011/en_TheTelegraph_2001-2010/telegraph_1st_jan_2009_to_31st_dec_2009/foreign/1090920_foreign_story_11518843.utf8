                                                                                                               Leonard Cohen falls during concert
                              Cohen: Stomach bug                            
	Madrid, Sept. 19 (AP): Leonard Cohen is recovering after collapsing onstage while on tour in eastern Spain, his music company said today.        
	The veteran poet and performer has since been released from hospital after suffering from a stomach complaint. Cohen was half-way through his song Bird on the Wire in Valencia when he fainted, causing the band to stop playing to rush to his aid as concertgoers watched. The concert was stopped.        
	A video showing Cohen kneeling down several times during the performance and then keeling over sideways during a saxophone solo has been placed on YouTube by a fan. The Canadian-born musician, who will be 75 years-old on Monday, was taken in an ambulance to the Nueve de Octubre hospital in Valencia but released early today, Barcelona-based Doctor Music Concerts said.        
	 Cohen was due to perform the last show of his Spanish tour at the Palau Sant Jordi concert hall in northeastern Barcelona on Monday.

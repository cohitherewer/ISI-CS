	London, Feb. 18: Facebook has reversed its decision to change its rules on allowing people to delete personal information, founder Mark Zuckerberg has announced in his blog.         
	The social networking site became embroiled in controversy after deleting a provision which said users could remove all their content at any time. New rules stated Facebook had rights to freely use anything people had uploaded to the website, even after members delete material or close accounts. Tens of thousands of its users threatened to close their accounts.         
	Subsequently the site has decided to abandon the new policy and revert back to the old terms, Zuckerberg wrote in his blog.

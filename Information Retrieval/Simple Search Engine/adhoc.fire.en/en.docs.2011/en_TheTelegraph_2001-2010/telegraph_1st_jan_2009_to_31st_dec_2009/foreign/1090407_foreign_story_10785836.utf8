	LAquila (Italy), April 6 (Reuters): A powerful earthquake struck central Italy early today, killing more than 100 people, making up to 50,000 homeless and flattening entire medieval towns while residents slept.        
	As rescue workers combed through the rubble for survivors and rushed to set up tents for the homeless before night fell, officials warned the death toll could still rise substantially and declined to estimate the number of missing.         
	Most of the dead were in LAquila, a 13th century mountain city about 100km east of Rome, and surrounding towns and villages in the Abruzzo region.Some towns in the area have been virtually destroyed in their entirety, said Gianfranco Fini, speaker of the lower house of parliament, as MPs observed a moment of silence.        
	Abruzzos regional government said more than 100 people were confirmed dead, nearly 14 hours after the quake struck with a magnitude of between 5.8 and 6.3. I woke up hearing what sounded like a bomb, said LAquila resident Angela Palumbo, 87.        
	We managed to escape with things falling all around us. Everything was shaking, furniture falling. I dont remember ever seeing anything like this in my life.        
	Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi cancelled a trip to Moscow and declared a national emergency, freeing funds for aid and rebuilding.         
	Flying in to the disaster zone, Berlusconi told reporters that now was the time to concentrate on relief efforts and we can discuss afterwards about the predictability of earthquakes.        
	Civil Protection Department officials said up to 50,000 people may have been made homeless in some 26 cities and towns. More than 1,500 people were injured and thousands of houses, churches and buildings collapsed or were damaged.                 
	Rubble was strewn throughout LAquila, a city of 68,000, and nearby towns, blocking roads and hampering rescue teams. Old women wailed and residents armed with only their bare hands helped firefighters and rescue workers tear through the rubble.        
	In the small town of Onna, 10 people were killed, said a Reuters photographer who saw a mother and her infant daughter carried away in the same coffin. Older houses and buildings made of stone, particularly in outlying villages, collapsed like straw houses.        
	Hospitals appealed for help from doctors and nurses throughout Italy. The smell of gas filled parts of the mountain towns and villages, pouring out of ruptured mains.        
	Berlusconi told reporters in LAquila that tent cities and field hospitals would be set up there and hotels on the Adriatic coast would be requisitioned to shelter the homeless.        
	Were hoping they give us a tent or something to sleep under tonight, said 70-year-old Isenia Santilli, taking shelter at a sports field outside LAquilas city centre where the Red Cross was feeding quake victims.

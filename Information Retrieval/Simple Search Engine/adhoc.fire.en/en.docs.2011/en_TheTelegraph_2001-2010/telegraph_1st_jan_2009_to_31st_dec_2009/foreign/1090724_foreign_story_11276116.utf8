	No Music for Diaz    
	 London, July 23 (PTI): Cameron Diaz is not sure whether she can do justice to the role of Maria in a remake of the 1965 Hollywood classic, The Sound of Music.      
	The 36-year-old Charlies Angels star is rumoured to be the favourite to take the lead role in the new remake.      
	Julie Andrews had portrayed Maria in the film and Diaz does not believe that she would be able to match the British actresss performance. I dont know if I would do it because that is one of those awe-striking moments. Julie is amazing and I dont know if I could follow an act like that, Diaz said.

                                                                                                               Paparazzo says Law hit her
                            
	London, July 23 (PTI): A photographer of Indian-origin, Harsha Gopal, has alleged that British actor Jude Law hit her on the face outside a London restaurant.        
	However, Law has firmly denied hitting the paparazzo. The Daily Mail carried pictures which show the 28-year-old being pushed away by the Alfie actor who was leaving a celebrity dinner party when the incident occurred. He hit me full on the face, it was a real stinger, it was very sore, Gopal said.

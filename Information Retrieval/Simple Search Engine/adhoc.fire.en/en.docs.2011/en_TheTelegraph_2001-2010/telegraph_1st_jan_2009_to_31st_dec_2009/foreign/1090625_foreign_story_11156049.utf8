The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Best picture nominees hiked to 10
                                                                                                               Best picture nominees hiked to 10
                              Room for more                            
	Beverly Hills, June 24 (AP): The Academy Awards are doubling the number of best-picture nominees from five to 10.        
	Academy president Sid Ganis said at a news conference that the academys board of governors made the decision to expand the slate. Ganis said the decision will open the field up to more worthy films for the top prize        
	The change takes effect with next years Oscars on March 7. The move is a return to Oscar traditions of the 1930s and 1940s, when 10 nominees were common.        
	Ganis said the board looked at last years slate of films and decided there was room for more in the top category. We nominated five, but there were many other great films last year, he said. Among last years most acclaimed movies was the The Dark Knight, which wound up snubbed.

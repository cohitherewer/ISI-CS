The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | How to deal with police? Ask Obama
                                                                                                               How to deal with police? Ask Obama
          KP NAYAR                              
	Washington, July 25: In what Indian politicians could well use as a cue for dealing with police high-handedness, US president Barack Obama has invited Harvards black scholar Henry Louis Gates Jr. and Sergeant James Crowley, the police officer who arrested Gates, for a beer at the White House.        
	More than 350 complainants who cited police misbehaviour, torture and harassment to the union home ministry and the National Human Rights Commission some years ago are said to have received no satisfactory redressal of their grievances and certainly no invitation for even a lassi from anyone in the Indian government, let alone a prime minister or a state chief minister.        
	The worlds most powerful man spent a considerable part of his day yesterday discussing with his aides ways to quell a raging controversy over his earlier comments at a presidential news conference on the arrest, phoned the police sergeant and the black professor and then made a surprise appearance during the daily White House briefing to announce the invitation to the protagonists in the riveting drama for drinking beer together.        
	 quot;I want to make clear that in my choice of words (at the Wednesday news conference) I unfortunately gave the impression that I was maligning the Cambridge Police Department and Sergeant Crowley specifically, quot; Obama told reporters when he interrupted the daily White House briefing.        
	 quot;I could have calibrated those words differently, and I told this to Sergeant Crowley, quot; Obama said of comment that that the Cambridge police had quot;acted stupidly. quot;        
	In an effort to balance and defuse the controversy, the president said: quot;I continue to believe that there was an overreaction in pulling professor Gates out of his home and to the (police) station. I also continue to believe, based on what I have heard, that professor Gates overreacted, as well. quot;        
	In an e-mail to The Boston Globe, Gates said he would meet the President and the police officer even as the professors lawyer clarified that Gates does not drink beer.        
	 quot;My entire academic career has been based on improving race relations, not exacerbating them, quot; he wrote in the e-mail. quot;It is time for all of us to move on, and to assess what we can learn from this experience. quot;        
	Several police unions which had come together to support Crowley and take on Obama since Wednesday were pleased with the Obamas attempts at reconciliation at the bar.        
	Sergeant Crowley was profoundly grateful that the president took time out of his busy schedule to attempt to resolve this situation, quot; the Cambridge Police Superior Officers association, the Cambridge Police Patrol Officers Association, and the Massachusetts Municipal Police Coalition said in a joint statement.        
	 quot;It is clear to us...that the president respects police officers and the often difficult and dangerous situations we face on a daily basis. quot;        
	Obama stepped up to defuse the controversy, in part, because his comments on the Gates arrest were becoming a huge diversion from his legislative agenda, especially healthcare reform.        
	For Indians the most vividly similar incident was a brutal assault by the Delhi police on May 9, 1997 on Martin Massey, a 48-year-old company executive who innocently strayed into then prime minister I K Gujrals sanitised travel route in the capital.        
	To add insult to injury, when Masseys son went the police station a few days later to collect the scooter the father was riding, the police asked for a bribe of Rs.3000, according to the victim.        
	The police also made the son sign a statement that his father had met with an accident while riding the scooter under the influence of alcohol.        
	Six years earlier, Navdeep Diwan, a Delhi-based business consultant, was similarly assaulted by Delhi police when he too strayed into the prime ministers travel route.In one of the worst cases of police excess, on Gandhi Jayanti day in 1993, shortly before then prime minister PV Narasimha Rao was to arrive in Rajghat, Delhi police violently dragged away a group of Gandhians offering prayer at the Mahatmas samadhi.        
	Unlike Gates or Crowley, none of these Indians ever got a phone call from even the lieutenant governor of Delhi, let alone their prime minister.

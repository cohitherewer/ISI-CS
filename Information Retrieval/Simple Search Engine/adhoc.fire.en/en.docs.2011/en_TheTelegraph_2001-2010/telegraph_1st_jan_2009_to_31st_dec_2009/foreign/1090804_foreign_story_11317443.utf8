	Naomis wrath    
	 London, Aug. 3 (PTI): Supermodel Naomi Campbell is back to her hell-raising ways.      
	According to the Daily Mail, this time a photographer was at the receiving end of her wrath. Campbell, known for her fiery temper, has been accused by an Italian photographer of assault.      
	Gaetano Di Giovanni said the model, who was holidaying with her billionaire boyfriend Mikhail Prokhorov in the island of Lipari, clawed his face and damaged his eye for which he was hospitalised.       
	First she hit with her bag, screaming at me and then she tried to slap me. Her nails still got my eye. For a few seconds I could not see a thing. I could hear that her bodyguards and her boyfriend were trying to drag her away, Giovanni said. Police in Lipari said no complaint has been registered yet.    
	Pitt parts    
	London (PTI): Brad Pitt has hinted at an early retirement as he had his time and now wants to concentrate on raising his large family. The 45-year-old believes that he has achieved all that he wished for in his career and wants to retire as there are fewer roles coming his way. I think acting is a younger mans game; there are fewer parts for older people. But I feel like Ive done it.

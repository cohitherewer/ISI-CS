The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Pak jets slam Taliban areas
                                                                                                               Pak jets slam Taliban areas
                            
	Islamabad, April 28 (AP): Pakistani jets and attack helicopters struck Taliban positions in mountains close to the capital today as part of a widening offensive against militants spreading out from the lawless region along the border with Afghanistan, the military said.        
	With residents reporting ground troops also moving into the Buner area, the operation could allay worry in the US and other western nations that nuclear-armed Pakistan lacks the will to fight extremists in the northwest, where al Qaida leader Osama bin Laden is thought to be hiding. The attack stands to further strain a shaky peace deal in the Malakand region, which Buner is a part of.         
	The truce has been widely viewed in the West as a surrender to the militants and a sign that Pakistans shaky civilian government does not recognise the threat they pose.        
	Analysts say the 100,000-plus government soldiers in the border region have little experience in guerrilla operations, having been trained only to fight a conventional war against India.        
	Heavily armed militants began moving into Buner, about 100km from Islamabad, this month from the nearby Swat Valley. Swat, a one-time tourist destination, has turned into a militant haven under the peace deal, which imposed Sharia in the area in exchange for an end to hostilities.        
	A military spokesman, Major Nasir Khan, said jets and helicopters attacked Taliban positions in mountains in the Babaji Kandao area of Buner this afternoon. Casualty figures were not immediately known. The militarys chief spokesman, Major General Athar Abbas, said troops were also moving into the region. He estimated the number of insurgents there at 450-500 and said the operation would be over within in a week.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | US unveils Iraq exit plan

	Camp Lejeune (North Carolina), Feb. 27 (Reuters): President Barack Obama announced today that he would withdraw US combat forces from Iraq by August 31, 2010, winding down the unpopular six-year war but leaving behind up to 50,000 troops until the end of 2011.        
	The 18-month timetable marks a historic juncture in a war that has been costly to the US and defined the presidency of George W. Bush.         
	It has been a huge drain on the treasury, cost the lives of some 4,250 US soldiers and damaged Americas standing in the world. I have chosen a timeline that will remove our combat brigades over the next 18 months. Let me say this as plainly as I can: by August 31, 2010, our combat mission in Iraq will end, Obama said in a speech at Camp Lejeune, a Marine Corps base in North Carolina.        
	Obama said 35,000 to 50,000 troops would remain to train and equip the Iraqi forces, protect civilian reconstruction projects and conduct limited counterterrorism operations.        
	Under the Status of Forces Agreement with the Iraqi government, I intend to remove all US troops from Iraq by the end of 2011. We will complete this transition to Iraqi responsibility, and we will bring our troops home with the honour that they have earned, he said.        
	Obamas decision to leave a sizeable force to bolster stability was welcomed by congressional Republicans, including former presidential candidate Senator John McCain.         
	Obama said Iraq had weathered horrific sectarian killings in 2006 and 2007 but that violence had now been substantially reduced.

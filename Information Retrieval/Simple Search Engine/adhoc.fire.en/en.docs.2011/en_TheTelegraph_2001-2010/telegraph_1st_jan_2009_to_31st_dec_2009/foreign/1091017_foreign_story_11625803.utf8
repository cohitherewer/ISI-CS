	Peshawar, Oct. 16 (AP): Three suicide bombers, including a woman, attacked a police station in Peshawar, killing 14 people today.        
	The bombing was the latest in a surge of terrorist attacks over the last 11 days that has killed more than 150 people and underscored the power of the Taliban, who have warned the army against launching any operation in the militants base close to the Afghan border.        
	Todays twin bombings targeted a heavily fortified police station in Peshawar, the main city in the northwest. One attacker drove a car filled with explosives to the main gate of the police station, as a motorcycle carrying a man and a woman pulled up behind it, Peshawar police chief Liaquat Ali Khan said.        
	The woman jumped off and ran towards a nearby housing complex where army officers live, while the man smashed the motorcycle into the car, which exploded into a huge fireball, he said. Police shot at the woman, who detonated explosives she was wearing.        
	The blast destroyed part of the police station and a mosque next to it.        
	It killed 14 people, including three police officers, two women and two children, said Gul Khan, a local police official. Another 15 people were wounded.        
	Insurgents have sent attackers wearing military uniforms to bypass security to carry out some of their recent raids. But the use of a female suicide bomber is extremely rare here and could signal a new tactic by the extremists.        
	In December 2007, what was believed to be the countrys first female bomber, blew herself up near a Christian school while apparently aiming for a military post in Peshawar. There were no other casualties.        
	Todays attack came a day after militants launched coordinated attacks on three law enforcement compounds in Lahore, killing 19 people as well as the nine attackers. Also yesterday, a car bomb in Peshawar killed a small child at a housing complex for government employees.        
	Initial investigations into the Lahore attacks show Taliban from the Afghan border region and militants from Punjab province were responsible, authorities have said. That has fuelled concerns the Taliban are forging links with other militant groups in the country, an alliance that would vastly increase the threat to the US-allied government.        
	Observers say Punjabs militant problem is most pervasive in its south. But speaking to reporters in Lahore today, provincial law minister Rana Sanaullah played down any such threat.        
	 The Taliban dont have any authority in southern Punjab, and there is no need for any operation against them, he said.        
	The government has said the planning for the attacks is often done near the Afghan border, while the foot soldiers are recruited in Punjab, which borders India and is Pakistans most populous province.

	Islamabad, March 7 (AP): Three separate bombings killed 15 people in northwestern Pakistan today, while authorities investigated reports that a pilotless US drone crashed elsewhere in the militant-plagued region bordering Afghanistan.        
	However, according to residents of Angoor Adda village in South Waziristan, where the drone is supposed to have crashed, the plane was shot down by Taliban militants.         
	Officials of the local administration and residents told reporters in the area that the drone, which was flying at a low altitude, was shot down by militants.         
	The bombings, coming days after gunmen attacked Sri Lankas visiting cricket team, were a fresh reminder of the militant threat in Pakistan.        
	Al Qaida and Taliban fighters are believed to use pockets of Pakistans northwest as bases to plan attacks on US and Nato forces in Afghanistan. The US has used drones to fire missile strikes against militants in the area. The main Pakistani Taliban leader, Baitullah Mehsud, is based in the South Waziristan region.        
	Pakistan army spokesman Major General Athar Abbas said authorities were investigating the reports. Two intelligence officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, said their informants and agents had yet to locate the drone wreckage.        
	Militants have staged numerous attacks against Pakistani security forces in recent years, but one today  a car bombing  was unusual in that a body was used to lure police, officials said.        
	Local police chief Rahim Shah said police went to the Badaber area, 24km from Peshawar, after an unknown caller told them of a body in a parked car. Residents and police had recently evicted militants from the area.        
	They found the white car. They also saw a body inside, but when they were pulling it out, the car bomb went off, Shah said. Seven policemen and a bystander were killed.        
	A roadside bomb killed three civilians and wounded four troops today in the town of Darra Adam Khel. In the Khyber tribal region, a suicide bomber killed four people and wounded five at a mosque that served as a headquarters for the militant group Ansarul Islam, government official Sadiq Khan said. Ansarul Islam is the rival of another extremist group, Lashkar-e-Islam, Khan said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Remaking of Obamas Rahmbo
                                                                                                               Remaking of Obamas Rahmbo
          MARK LEIBOVICH                          Emanuel: New image                                  
	Washington, Jan. 25: Early this month, Barack Obama was meeting the House speaker, Nancy Pelosi, and other lawmakers when Rahm Emanuel, his chief of staff, began nervously cracking a knuckle.        
	Obama then turned to complain to Emanuel about his noisy habit.        
	At which point, Emanuel held the offending knuckle up to Obamas left ear and, like an annoying little brother, snapped off a few special cracks.         
	The episode, confirmed by Emanuels office, underscores some essential truths about Emanuel (nicknamed Rahmbo by some): He is brash, has a deep comfort level with his new boss and has been ever-present at Obamas side of late, in meetings, on podiums and in photographs.        
	There he was, standing at President Obamas desk in one of the first Oval Office pictures; and again, playfully thumbing his nose at his former House colleagues during the inauguration; there he was, accompanying the President to a meeting with Congressional leaders on Friday.        
	Emanuel is arguably the second most powerful man in America and, just a few days into his tenure, already one of the highest-profile chiefs of staff in recent memory.         
	In recent months, he has played a crucial role in the selection and courtship of nearly every cabinet member and key White House staff member.        
	Renowned as a fierce partisan, he has been an ardent ambassador to Republicans, including Obamas defeated rival, Senator John McCain of Arizona. He has exerted influence on countless decisions; in meetings, administration officials say, Obama often allows him to speak first and last.         
	You can see how he listens and reacts to Rahm, said Ron Klain, the chief of staff to Vice-President Joseph R. Biden. You can see that his opinion is being shaped.         
	A reason Emanuel, 49, has drawn so much attention is that he seems to be in a kind of recalibration mode.        
	How will the feisty, bombastic and, at times, impulsive former Congressman blend with the cool, collegial and deliberate culture of Obama World? And one that is trying to foster bipartisanship? This is someone who once wrote in Campaign and Elections magazine that the untainted Republican has not yet been invented.        
	It is clear to friends and colleagues that Emanuel is trying to rein himself in, lower his voice, even cut down on his use of profanity.        
	As chief of staff, you take on the aura and image and, in some instance, the political values of the person you work for, said former Representative Ray LaHood, an Illinois Republican who is now transportation secretary. I think hes beginning to morph himself into the Obama image.        
	Emanuel acknowledged in an interview on Friday that a stereotype of him as a relentless hothead has some factual basis. But it is an exaggerated or outdated picture, he said.        
	Im not yelling at people; Im not jumping on tables, he said. Thats a campaign. Being the chief of staff of a government is different. You have different tools in your toolbox.        
	Still, his high profile a nd temperament are at odds with that of some past White House chiefs of staff: they were often low-key types who put the staff part of their job titles before chief.        
	Emanuel, who had hopes of becoming House speaker, has stepped into a job characterised by short tenures  just under two and a half years, on average  high burnout rates and the need to subjugate personal ambitions to the service of the President.        
	He is not accustomed to fading discreetly into the background  viewed by many as a consummate purveyor of a crass, knee-capping brand of politics.         
	Obama acknowledged as much at a 2005 event for Emanuel, who is a former ballet dancer. When Emanuel lost part of his middle finger while cutting meat as a teenager, Obama joked, the accident rendered him practically mute.        
	While acknowledging that he can be something of a showman, friends say Emanuel has calmed considerably.        
	Late on Friday afternoon, at the end of his first week in the White House, Emanuel was sitting in his corner office, sick with a cold, baggy-eyed and looking tired. Everyone keeps saying, Are you having fun? he said. Fun is not the first adjective that comes to mind.         
	He woke as usual at 5am, swam a mile, read papers and was in the office at 7 for the senior staff meeting at 7.30. Earlier, on days he did not swim, he worked out in and conducted business at the House gym: 25 minutes on the bike, 20 minutes on the elliptical, 120 sit-ups, 55 push-ups and many sweaty conversations with his former colleagues.        
	Emanuel, in the interview, rejected any notion that he was reinventing himself for his new job. But he is mindful, he said, that he must fit into a culture that was forged over two years on a campaign, a group that was part of a journey together.        
	It will not always be pleasant for Emanuel. Hes going to be blamed for a lot of things, a former colleague said.        
	Saying no is a big part of being chief of staff. Infighting is inevitable; so are enemies and rivalries. In addition to cabinet officials  and the Vice-President  a cadre of senior advisers who have long and varied histories with Obama will be seeking his attention.        
	Emanuel has been in the job four days  and, by days end on Friday, it looked more like four years.        
	He is slumped deep in his couch, periodically swatting at a giant fly that keeps orbiting his office. He is hoping to get out of the office to meet some friends for the Jewish Sabbath dinner. He has a physical therapy appointment for a pinched nerve in his neck.        
	He missed his children  8, 10 and 11  who are visiting this week but are soon headed back to Chicago, where they are remaining for now. For me to be the parent I want to be, I think its very hard, he said, referring to the demands of his current job.         
	Later, Obama came to his door.         
	Mr. President! Emanuel said, jumping from his couch to his feet in something that resembled a dance move, and they walked out together.

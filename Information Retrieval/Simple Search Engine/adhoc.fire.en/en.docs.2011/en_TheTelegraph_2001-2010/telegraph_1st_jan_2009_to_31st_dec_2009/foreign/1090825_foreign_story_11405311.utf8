	London, Aug. 24: Staff with mobile technology such as BlackBerries work an extra 15 hours a week as they constantly check emails even out of the office, according to new research.        
	A survey of over 600 employees revealed many were turning into workaholics because of the ability to receive and send messages and work online even when they were at home.         
	Employment law firm Peninsula said the working week was being extended to around 55 hours for many people and urged employers to make sure their staff were not breaching working time regulations.        
	Managing director Peter Bone said: It is important for staff to spend quality time away from the office, spending time with the family, or undertaking recreational activities rather than tapping away responding to client emails.        
	Bosses should encourage staff not to work from home unless necessary. Inform staff that they should limit working from home. If they are happy to work away then ensure they agree to opt out of the maximum working week and have this signed.         
	Limit the extent to which employees are using their devices when they choose to do so; unrested employees will be less productive.

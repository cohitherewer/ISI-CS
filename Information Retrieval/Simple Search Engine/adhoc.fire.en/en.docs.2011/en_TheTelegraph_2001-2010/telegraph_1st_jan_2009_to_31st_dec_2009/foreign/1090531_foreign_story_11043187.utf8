The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Leno bids farewell to TV show
                                                                                                               Leno bids farewell to TV show
                            
	Los Angeles, May 30 (Reuters): Jay Leno bid farewell to The Tonight Show yesterday, ending his 17-year run as host with a finale that stayed true to the style that made him the top-rated performer on US late-night television.        
	The main difference was a long ovation that Leno struggled to quiet as he took the stage for an opening monologue that poked fun, as usual, at politicians, celebrities and current events.        
	He thanked the likes of pop star Michael Jackson and former White House intern Monica Lewinsky, whose affair with Bill Clinton led to the former Presidents impeachment, for giving him material over the years.         
	He also took a final jab at his network, NBC, which is mired at the bottom of the ratings among the four major US broadcasters.         
	Leno takes his act to 10pm on NBC this autumn.

                                                                                                               31 kids killed in Mexico fire
                            
	Mexico City, June 6 (AP): A fast-moving fire killed 31 children in a day care centre in northern Mexico despite desperate attempts by firefighters who punched through walls and fought their way through flames to rescue babies, toddlers and others trapped inside.        
	At least 25 children and five employees were hospitalised after yesterdays fire in ABC day care in the city of Hermosillo, said Jose Larrinaga, a spokesman for investigators in the state of Sonora, which borders Arizona.        
	Some of the injured suffered severe burns and might be taken to US hospitals, Sonora Governor Eduardo Bours said. For now, were concentrating on saving as many kids as possible, he said.        
	There were about 100 children in the centre at the time, with ages ranging from six months to 5 years, said Guadalupe Ayala, coordinator of Red Cross rescue workers. Firefighters had to knock holes in the walls to get the children, he added.        
	The fire may have started at a tyre and car warehouse yesterday afternoon and spread to the neighbouring centre, state officials said. Firefighters took two hours to control the blaze, the cause of which was still unknown.        
	Larrinaga said most children died of asphyxiation. Neighbours rushed to help pull out the children.

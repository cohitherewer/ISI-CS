	London, Sept. 7: Spending time on the Facebook networking site could enhance a key element of intelligence that is vital to success in life, a psychologist has claimed, but using Twitter may have the opposite effect.        
	Playing video war games and solving Sudoku may have the same effect as keeping up to date with Facebook, according to Tracy Alloway. But text messaging, micro-blogging on Twitter and watching YouTube were all likely to weaken working memory.        
	 Working memory involves the ability both to remember information and to use it. At a job interview, a candidate will employ working memory to match answers to questions in the most impressive way.        
	Alloway, from the University of Stirling in Scotland, has extensively studied working memory and believes it to be far more important to success and happiness than IQ.        
	Her team has developed a working memory training programme that greatly increased the performance of slow-learning children aged 11 to 14 at a school in Durham.

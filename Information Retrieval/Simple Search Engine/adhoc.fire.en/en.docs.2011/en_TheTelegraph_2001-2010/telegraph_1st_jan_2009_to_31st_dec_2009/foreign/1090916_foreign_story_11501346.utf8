	Perfect Madonna    
	 New York, Sept. 15 (PTI): Queen of Pop Madonna may have drawn flak for her sinewy arms, but her trainer insists that the singer has a perfect figure and looks even better than US First Lady Michelle Obama.       
	Madonnas body is perfect. She has no fat, no cellulite, she is so toned and her arms are amazing. Michelle Obamas arms look beautiful, but I think I could get her into even better shape, her personal trainer Tracy Anderson said.      
	The 51-year-old singer works hard with Anderson for two hours a day, six days a week to maintain her physique, reports the New York Post. We train for two hours six days a week. We do 45 minutes of dance aerobics, followed by work on muscle tone, flexibility and definition.

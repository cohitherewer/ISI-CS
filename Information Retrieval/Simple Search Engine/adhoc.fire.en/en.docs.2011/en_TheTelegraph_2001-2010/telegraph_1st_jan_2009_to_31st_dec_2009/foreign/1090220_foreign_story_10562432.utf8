The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Swat pact with militants hangs in limbo

          PAMELA CONSTABLE, KAREN DEYOUNG AND HAQ NAWAZ KHAN                          Journalists in Islamabad protest the killing of Geo TV scribe Musa Khan Khel in the Swat Valley. Editor Hamid Mir said Musas killing was deliberate and planned as his body had as many as 32 gunshot wounds. He said the slain scribe had recorded statement on threats to his life, not once but twice, and this should be taken as evidence.(AFP)                                  
	Islamabad, Feb. 19: A controversial, closely watched peace agreement designed to end Taliban violence in the scenic Swat Valley hung in limbo yesterday amid criticism in Pakistan and rising concern in Washington.        
	Neither the Pakistani government nor the Islamist extremists were willing to formalise the accord, announced by Pakistani officials on Monday. The proposed pact marks an unprecedented and risky attempt to disarm about 2,000 Taliban fighters, who have invaded and terrorised a once-bucolic area of 1.5 million people in northwestern Pakistan, by offering to install a strict system of Islamic law in the surrounding district.        
	Supporters see the offer as an urgently needed bid for peace and a potential model for other areas ravaged by Pakistans growing Islamist militancy.         
	In the Swat Valley town of Mingora, talks were underway between the emissaries of radical cleric Maulana Sufi Mohammad and his son-in-law Maulana Fazlullah, a pro-Taliban militant with links to al Qaida, to stop the fighting in the valley.         
	Critics say it would make too many concessions to ruthless extremist forces and provide them with a launching pad to drive deeper into the settled areas of Pakistan from their safe haven in the rough tribal districts along the border with Afghanistan.        
	This is a bad idea that sends a very wrong signal, said Rifaat Hussain, a professor of defence and security studies at Quaid-i-Azam University in Islamabad.        
	It legitimises the existence of violent armed groups and allows them to draw the wrong lesson: that if you are powerful enough to challenge the writ of the state, it will cave in and appease you.        
	In Washington, where the Obama administration has been conspicuously silent about the agreement, officials said privately that they considered it a major setback for US goals in the region. Its a surrender disguised as a truce, one official said, describing it as an admission that the government lacks the capacity to defend the crucial western part of the country.        
	Several officials said the proposed pact was evidence that the Pakistani government has no coherent plan for combating militancy.         
	One noted that Pakistan had offered no comprehensive package of economic aid or outlined a long-term structure for the region. This is signing a deal and calling it done, this official said. What comes next?        
	In December, Pakistani troops attempting to oust the Taliban from the Swat Valley were defeated by the far smaller extremist force. The military met resistance that they and we didnt expect, a US official said, citing sophisticated Taliban tactics, command and communications and participation by extremists from Chechnya and Afghanistan.         
	The military, he said, quot;won some tactical victories; they didnt win their strategic objectives. Mondays proposed peace accord took the Obama administration by surprise.         
	They received no advance notice of the deal and remained uncertain of what was happening on the ground.         
	The officials said they hoped for clarification by next week, when senior Pakistani and Afghan delegations are due to arrive in Washington for high-level talks.

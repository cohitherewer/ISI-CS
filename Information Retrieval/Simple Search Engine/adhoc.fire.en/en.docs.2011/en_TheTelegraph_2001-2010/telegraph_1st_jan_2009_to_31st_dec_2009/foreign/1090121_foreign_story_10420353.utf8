                                                                                                               Kennedy collapses at lunch
                            
	Washington, Jan. 20 (Agencies): Senators Edward M. Kennedy and Robert Byrd have been taken ill at an inauguration luncheon for President Barack Obama.        
	The ailing Kennedy collapsed at the luncheon and was evacuated by medical staff, apparently suffering from convulsions, a congressional aide said.        
	Details were not available about what happened to Byrd.         
	A Capitol police officer stood up at the luncheon and said medical attention was needed.        
	Obama, who had been sworn in the new President just hours before, said his prayers were with Kennedy and his family. Kennedy, 76, is battling a life-threatening brain tumour.        
	He is the brother of the late John F. Kennedy and one of the Senates most respected Democrats.

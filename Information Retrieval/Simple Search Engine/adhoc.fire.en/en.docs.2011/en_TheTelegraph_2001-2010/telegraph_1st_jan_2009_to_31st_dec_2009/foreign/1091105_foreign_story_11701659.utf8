	Hurley return    
	 London, Nov. 4 (PTI): Actress and model Elizabeth Hurley, who had vowed not to act anymore, is ready to make a comeback to movies now.      
	The 44-year-old, who had said a permanent goodbye to her acting career after giving birth to her son Damian with former boyfriend Steve Bing, is willing to start her second innings.       
	I said no (more movies). When I had my son I said no because I wanted to be in the country with him full time but now, maybe I might do another movie next year. My son wants me to very much, said Hurley.    
	Pitt bike    
	Tokyo (AP): Brad Pitt says he is in the market for a new motorcycle. The actor said he trashed his favourite bike recently while trying to escape overzealous photographers. I had a little mishap, he said. I will definitely be looking at motorcycles, Pitt added. Youve got some of the best builders right here.

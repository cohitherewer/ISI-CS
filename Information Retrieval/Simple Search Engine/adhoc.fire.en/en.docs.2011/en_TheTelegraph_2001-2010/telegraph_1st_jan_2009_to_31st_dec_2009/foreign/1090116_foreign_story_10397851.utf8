	New York, Jan. 15: Apple chief executive Steven P. Jobs yesterdaysaid he was taking a leave of absence because of health concerns, casting a pall over one of the worlds most closely watched companies.        
	Jobs wrote in a letter to Apple employees, released after the markets closed, that he had learned over the last week that his health problems were more complex than he originally thought. He said he planned to return to Apple at the end of June and in the meantime would hand day-to-day control of Apple over to Timothy D. Cook, its longtime chief operating officer.        
	Jobs, 53, wrote that curiosity about his health continued to be a distraction not only for me and my family, but everyone else at Apple as well. He said he would maintain the chief executive title and stay involved in major strategic decisions.        
	Jobss leave of absence is the latest twist in a story that has left the companys shareholders, analysts and ardent fans exasperated and straining to divine any hidden meanings in the companys vaguely worded communications.         
	In his letter, Jobs offered no new details about the cause of his health problems. In a letter last week that was meant to calm fears about his condition, he said a hormone imbalance was robbing his body of proteins and causing him to lose weight. Jobs recovered from pancreatic cancer after surgery in 2004, but has appeared unusually gaunt at recent appearances.        
	Two people who are familiar with Jobss current medical treatment said he was not suffering from a recurrence of cancer, but a condition that was preventing his body from absorbing food. Doctors have also advised him to cut down on stress, which may be making the problem worse, these people said.        
	In June, when Jobs appeared strikingly thin at a company conference for programmers, an Apple spokeswoman said he was recovering from a common bug. Soon afterwards, Jobs acknowledged to The New York Times that he was suffering from digestive difficulties related to an operation he had as part of his cancer treatment.        
	Jobs does not run Apple alone, and now at least one of his deputies will have a moment in the sun. Cook joined Apple in 1998 from the computer maker Compaq and is responsible for the companys manufacturing and sales operations.        
	I dont think we know enough about Tim since he has never really been in the limelight, said Toni Sacconaghi, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein amp; Company. What we can say is Apple has a complicated business model with enormous seasonality. But it has been exceptionally well run across a number of dimensions for a number of years. I think a lot of that credit goes to Tim.        
	By all accounts, Cook does not have the long-term vision or showmanship of Jobs, who appears capable of peering around corners into the future of technology, and can whip crowds into a frenzy merely by taking something new out of his pocket.         
	That is why analysts and shareholders saw so much portent in Jobss 170-word letter. These are times where you reflect about what Steve Jobs means for the company, said Gene Munster, an analyst at Piper Jaffray.

	It was like 10 clock. Everybody was asleep and we hear all this barking and jumping around, Michelle Obama said. The President and I came out and we thought somebody was out there. And it was just Bo. He was playing with his ball. And it was like there was another person in the house.        
	Hes kind of crazy, but hes still a puppy. So he likes to play a lot, she said. He loves to chew on peoples feet, Michelle Obama said.

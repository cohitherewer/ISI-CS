	Robot model    
	 London, April 14: Kate Moss may have a rival on the catwalk as Japanese engineers unveiled the first robotic supermodel at Tokyo Fashion Week, reports The Daily Telegraph.       
	HRP-4C has 30 motors in her body that allow her to walk and move her arms as well as eight motors on her face allowing her to create facial expressions such as anger and surprise. It means she can imitate the gait and pose of models.      
	At 1.5 metres tall, the 1.4 million robot is not tall enough to be a fashion model but is instead based on the average Japanese woman.      
	Weighing 43kg she even slimmed down for the event, as her predecessor weighed 58kg. HRP-4C helped launch Tokyo Fashion Week at the end of last month.      
	Designers say she has not been built with daily chores in mind as many hope robots will be able to do in the future. Hirohisa Hirukawa, one of the robots developers, said: Technology hasnt reached that level.

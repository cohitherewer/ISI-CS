	London, Feb. 20: Damon Buffini, the millionaire chairman of private equity firm Permira, gave partners in his firm a dressing down and ordered them to eat burgers  after one of them complained about the standard of food at a five-star hotel.         
	Buffini lectured the partners, many of whom earned tens of millions of pounds during the boom years, for failing to appreciate how lucky they were. The incident happened at the firms annual week away at the Pennyhill Park in Surrey.         
	Buffini  who was raised by his single mother on a Leicester council estate  was appalled to overhear colleagues complain about the food at the five-star hotel, which charges more than 1,000 a night for suites. He ordered that the kitchen serve burgers the following evening and, during dinner, took it upon himself to personally admonish his staff for their attitude. The firm declined to comment, but one insider who was at the get together, confirmed that Buffini had angrily took people to task during the burger supper. The hotel  which has a Michelin star restaurant  is best known for being the England rugby teams base during the Six Nations tournament.         
	Permira is Europes largest private equity firm. Prior to the economic collapse, it attracted fierce criticism for its perceived heavy-handed treatment of the businesses it bought. Permira and the rest of the industry stood accused of slashing jobs, loading companies up with debt, asset-stripping and a lack of transparency, while partners reaped financial rewards and paid little tax.

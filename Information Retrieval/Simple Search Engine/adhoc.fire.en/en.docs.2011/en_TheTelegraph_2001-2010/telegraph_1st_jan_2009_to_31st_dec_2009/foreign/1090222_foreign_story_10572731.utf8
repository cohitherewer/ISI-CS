The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Latvia govt falls over economic turmoil
                                                                                                               Latvia govt falls over economic turmoil

	Kiev (Ukraine), Feb. 21: Latvias Centre-Right coalition government collapsed yesterday, a victim of the countrys growing economic and political turmoil. It was the second European government, after Iceland, to disintegrate because of the international financial crisis.        
	The government in Riga, faced with forecasts of a severe drop in the economy this year, was the first in Eastern Europe to succumb to turmoil caused by the crisis. Its collapse rounded out a week in which worries about feeble investment and output and shaky banks in eastern Europe coursed through international markets.        
	Latvia has had a history of revolving-door politics and complex coalitions since pulling free of the Soviet Union in 1991. Prime Minister Ivars Godmanis, who presented his resignation to President Valdis Zatlers yesterday, had been in power only since December 2007. But the precipitous plunge of Latvias economy, which helped provoke riots last month that were the countrys worst since 1991, played a major part in the governments downfall.        
	His departure comes at a critical juncture for Latvia. After entering the EU in 2004, Latvia and its neighbours Estonia and Lithuania posted Europes highest growth figures, earning the moniker the Baltic Tigers. Now Latvia shows the continents biggest losses.

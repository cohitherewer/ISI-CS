The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Obama in surprise Iraq visit

	Baghdad, April 7 (AP): Cheered wildly by US troops, President Barack Obama flew unannounced into Iraq today and promptly declared it was time for Iraqis to take responsibility for their country after Americas commitment of six years and thousands of lives.        
	You have given Iraq the opportunity to stand on its own as a democratic country, the President said as he made a brief inspection of a war he opposed as candidate and now vows to end as commander in chief. That is an extraordinary achievement.        
	A total of 4,265 US troops have lost their lives in Iraq since March 2003, and Obama said American forces had performed brilliantly... under enormous strain.        
	It is time for us to transition to the Iraqis, he said as an estimated 600 troops cheered. They need to take responsibility for their country.        
	 Obama also met Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki, who said afterwards that he had assured the President that all the progress that has been made in the security area will continue.        
	Obama said he had strongly encouraged the Iraqi leader to take steps to unite political factions, including integrating Sunnis into the government and security forces.        
	Obama flew into Iraq shrouded by secrecy and was shielded by heavy security from the moment he stepped off a gleaming white and blue Air Force One.        
	The plane touched down a few hours after a car bombing in a Shia neighbourhood of the capital city punctuated a recent surge in violence in the war-ravaged country. Many thousands of Iraqis have died in the six years of war in addition to the American losses.        
	Obama spoke favourably of political progress but also expressed concern that recent gains could deteriorate with the national elections.         
	Obama wore a business suit as he descended the steps of his plane after a flight from Turkey. He shook hands with General Ray Odierno, the top US commander in the country, then stepped into an SUV for a brief ride to Camp Victory, the main American military base in Iraq. Under grey skies, the motorcade rolled past troops standing at attention. It was wonderful to see the troops out there, Obama said. Im so grateful, they put their heart and souls into it.

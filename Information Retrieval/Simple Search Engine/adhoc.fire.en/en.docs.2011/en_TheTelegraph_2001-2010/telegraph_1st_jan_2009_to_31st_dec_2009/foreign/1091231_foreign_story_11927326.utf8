The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Imran: Taliban in talks offer
                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      Imran: Taliban in talks offer
                              Imran Khan                            
	Lahore, Dec. 30 (PTI): Pakistani Taliban commanders have contacted cricketer-turned-politician Imran Khan to broker peace talks with the government.         
	However, Khan said he would act as a mediator only if authorities give their consent.        
	The Taliban have contacted me for peace negotiations with the government. But I will only play a mediators role if the government gives its consent, Khan said, but did not mention which faction of the local Taliban had contacted him.        
	The Taliban today claimed responsibility for a suicide bombing that killed 43 people in Karachi, and threatened more attacks. My group claims responsibility for the Karachi attack and we will carry out more such attacks, within 10 days, said Asmatullah Shaheen, one of the commanders of Tehrik-e-Taliban Pakistan, or Taliban Movement of Pakistan, who spoke by telephone to a Reuters reporter in Peshawar.        
	Imran Khan, who heads the Tehrik-e-Insaaf party, has opposed military operations against the Taliban and other militant groups.        
	He had earlier offered to act as a mediator between the Taliban and government. There had been no response from the government to his offer to mediate.        
	Some leaders of the ruling Pakistan Peoples Party and sections of the media have criticised Khan for what they describe as his pro-Taliban stance.        
	Interior minister Rehman Malik too has made it clear that the federal government has no intention of holding talks with the Taliban or other terrorists.        
	They must surrender before any peace talks can be initiated, he said. However, the Taliban in the northwestern Swat valley had welcomed Khans offer to broker peace talks. Khan has also called on the PPP-led government to convene a meeting of all political parties to discuss challenges confronting the country.         
	The prospect of more violence comes at a tricky time for Pakistani President Asif Ali Zardari, who already faces political heat because corruption charges.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Facebook links Cubans with family abroad
                                                                                                               Facebook links Cubans with family abroad
                            
	Havana, Oct. 15 (Reuters): Susana has never set foot outside Cuba but she has seen plenty of pictures of her friends houses in Miami, their new cars and even the fancy disco they went to the other night.        
	Like more and more of her fellow Cubans, she is getting a glimpse of the larger world through Facebook, the Internet social network that is allowing contact with the Cuban diaspora in ways previously unthinkable from the communist-run island.        
	It is a way of staying in touch with the rest of the world. You check the pages of your friends living abroad and you see how they live, where they go, who they hang out with. Its like being there, said the 24-year-old pharmacist. All my Cuban friends who have access to the Internet are now on Facebook, she said.        
	With at least 1.5 million Cuban exiles living abroad  most in the US just 140km across the Florida Straits from Cuba  and international phone calls too costly for most Cubans, Facebook provides a new way for the divided Cuban world to come together.        
	President Barack Obama has lifted restrictions on Cuban Americans visiting relatives in Cuba in a slight easing of the long-running US trade embargo on the island, but thousands of Cuban families remain separated.        
	Facebook does not disclose how many people in Cuba have subscribed to the service, but there are several indicators that the number is on the rise  no small feat in a country where Internet access is limited.        
	Alain Ramirez, founder of a Miami-based Facebook group for former students of the prestigious Lenin secondary school in Havana, estimates that 30 per cent of the groups 1,750 members are in Cuba. The number of users in Cuba is growing fast. There are more every day, but they are not very active.

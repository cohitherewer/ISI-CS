The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Mehsud rival shot dead
                                                                                                               Mehsud rival shot dead
          NASIR JAFFRY                              
	Islamabad, June 23: A top militant commander opposed to feared Taliban chief Baitullah Mehsud was today shot dead in northwestern Pakistan as the military plans to launch a full-scale operation into Mehsuds stronghold in South Waziristan.        
	Qari Zain-ud-din, 26, who deserted Mehsud some nine months ago and became his opponent, was asleep in his Dera Ismail Khans office after saying morning prayers when one of his own accomplices shot him and his guard dead.        
	According to local police and intelligence officials, who identified the assassin as Gulbadin Mehsud, doctors declared Zainuddin dead after his men brought him to hospital.        
	The slain militant leader, who was heading a 1,000-strong force of guirella fighters, has been opposing Mehsud for killing innocent civilians in bomb explosions and suicide attacks. He had also reportedly endorsed a military operation against Mehsud.        
	Zain-ud-din had also recently disclosed that Mehsud masterminded assassination of former premier Benazir Bhutto during an election rally in December 2007 and sent two men to garrison town of Rawalpindi for the purpose.         
	Mehsud claimed responsibility of several suicide attacks all over Pakistan and his TTP said they were in revene for the ongoing military operation in Swat.        
	Zain-ud-dins aides said that the man, who killed their chief was sent by Mehsud, who formed Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan a couple of years ago after his friend and a top militant commander Abdullah Mehsud, a former one-legged Guantanamo Bay prisoner was killed by security forces in Balochistan province.        
	Observers believed that Zainuddin assassination reflects prowess and capability of Mehsud to eliminate his rivals.        
	Leading analyst Hassan Askari told The Telegraph that the latest incident should come as a reminder for the government that Mehsud would prove to be a tough and difficult target.        
	However, he said, the government could take advantage of a possible conflict between the intra-Mehsud conflict after Zain-ud-dins assassination.        
	The government, which is currently engaged in a full-scale military operation against Taliban in the three northwestern districts of Lower Dir, Buner and Swat since April, has already ordered the army to launch an offesnive against Mehsud and his network.        
	The assassination coincided with a drone attack one one of the forward operating positions of Taliban in South Waziristan on Tuesday, killing six militants and injuring seven others.        
	Security officials in the area said that the drone fired three missiles and destroyed a bunker and a compound of Taliban on a mountain peak on the outskirts of Makeen town.

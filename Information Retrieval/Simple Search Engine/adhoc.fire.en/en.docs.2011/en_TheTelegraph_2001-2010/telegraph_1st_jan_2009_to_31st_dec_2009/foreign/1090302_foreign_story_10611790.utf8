The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Last calls to mother amp; PM
                                                                                                               Last calls to mother amp; PM
          FARID HOSSAIN                              
	Dhaka, March 1: Major General Shakil Ahmed made two mobile calls, one to his mother and another to the Prime Minister, minutes before bullets fired by his own troops from Bangladesh Rifles silenced him for ever.        
	Im in trouble, pray for me mother, the BDR director-general said in one of the calls at the start of Wednesdays mutiny, according to his mother, Syeda Monika Begum.        
	In response to the other SOS, Sheikh Hasina promised to rush the army to rescue him. Army troops were dispatched immediately but they were too late to stop the massacre of army officers commanding the BDR, and were held back to save the lives of the hostages.        
	Ahmed, 50, who had been appointed BDR chief in 2001, had come under the spotlight in 2007, more as a relief administrator than a soldier.        
	The army-backed caretaker government, which ruled for two years before Hasina was elected to power two months ago, had engaged the BDR in running fair-price food shops following a 50 per cent hike in food prices.        
	Those days Ahmed talked more about food shortage, price hikes, export and import.        
	Named Operation Dalbhat (lentils and rice), the campaign earned praise from the public because it sold rice and other foodstuff cheaper than market shops.        
	Yet the same operation is now being seen as one of the reasons why Ahmed was killed. BDR troops upset at not being paid overtime for their work on Dalbhat allegedly carried out the first wave of attacks, prompting others generally aggrieved at job conditions to join in.        
	During Ahmeds stint as BDR chief, relations with the BSF too had improved. Under his predecessor Fazlur Rahman in 2001, BDR troops had killed 19 BSF jawans at the Assam border.        
	Ahmeds decomposing body, wrapped in his uniform showing his rank stars, was dug out of a mass grave on Friday along with 37 other officers bodies. A day later, rescuers found the body of his wife, Naznin Aktar Sipu, in another mass grave inside the BDR complex.        
	His two children survived because they were in school in another part of the city.

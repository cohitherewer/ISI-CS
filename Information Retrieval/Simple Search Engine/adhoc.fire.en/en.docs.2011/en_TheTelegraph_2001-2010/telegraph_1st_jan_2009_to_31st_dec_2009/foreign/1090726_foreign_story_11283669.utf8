	Wasilla (Alaska), July 25 (AP): More than a thousand people showed up for former Republican vice-presidential candidate Sarah Palins annual picnic held in her hometown of Wasilla.        
	Palin, who is resigning and leaves office tomorrow, used the occasion to sign autographs and hand out hot dogs.        
	The governor  dressed casually in blue jeans and a red sweat shirt that read Once a patriot, always a patriot  was mobbed by well-wishers who offered babies, books, calendars, skateboards and even their hands for autographs.         
	Several long-time picnic-goers said this years crowd dwarfed last years.        
	Fred Kostrick, an 84-year-old World War II veteran from Michigan who attended the event, said he appreciated Palins support of the military.        
	I think shes one hell of a lady, he said. Shes tough, she stands her ground and shes taken a lot of guff  more than I could.        
	Others, such as Wes Hammerick, relayed his admiration for the governor and his dreams for the future in song. In 2012, Ill give you a hint. Alaskas pit bull will be our President, he sang in a tune titled North to the Future. At the end of the song, the Big Lake, Alaska, resident shout ed: Sarah Palin for President! A teenage boy replied as loudly, Obama!

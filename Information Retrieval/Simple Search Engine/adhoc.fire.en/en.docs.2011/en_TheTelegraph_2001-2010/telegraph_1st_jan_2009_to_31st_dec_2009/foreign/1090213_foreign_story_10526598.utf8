The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Bankers get grilled, vow to cut pay amp; face reality
                                                                                                               Bankers get grilled, vow to cut pay amp; face reality
          LOUISE STORY                          Vikram Pandit. (Jay Mandal/ On Assignment)                                  
	Washington, Feb. 12: James DAgostino craned his neck to get a view of the Morgan Stanley chief executive John J. Mack in the hope that the Wall Street titan would be subjected to a firestorm of criticism in a reckoning before Congress.         
	After participating in a protest last weekend at Macks home in Rye, New York, DAgostino said he was eager to see lawmakers go after him. And the others, too.         
	But inside the House chamber where Mack sat shoulder to shoulder with Vikram S. Pandit, Kenneth D. Lewis and the heads of five other too-big-to-fail banks leaning on government support, lawmakers instead delivered the equivalent of a slow burn.         
	There is in the country a great deal of anger about the financial institutions, including those represented here, Barney Frank, the chairman of the House Financial Services Committee said, gazing at the row of executives. But, Frank continued, it would be impractical to scrap the entire financial system and start anew.         
	Bank of America. Citigroup. Goldman Sachs. Morgan Stanley. These are the among the banks that the public blames for creating the mess that ravaged financial markets and ripped into the economy.         
	Mack offered a full-throated mea culpa for the banks role in fuelling the crisis (We are sorry for it, he said).         
	Pandit, the head of Citigroup, pledged to cut his salary to $1 a year until the bank returned to profitability and took personal responsibility for the mistake of even thinking about buying a new $50 million private jet after getting government financing. I get the new reality, and I will make sure Citi gets it as well, he declared.

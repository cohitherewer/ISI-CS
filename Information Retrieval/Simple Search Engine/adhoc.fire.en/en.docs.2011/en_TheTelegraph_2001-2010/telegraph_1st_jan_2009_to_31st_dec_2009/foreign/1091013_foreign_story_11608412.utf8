The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Pak court quashes Saeed jihad cases
                                                                                                               Pak court quashes Saeed jihad cases
          NASIR JAFFRY AND AGENCIES                          Saeed: Fresh reprieve                                  
	Islamabad, Oct. 12: Lahore High Court today quashed two cases against Hafiz Mohammad Saeed, the militant leader who is among Indias most wanted, saying he could not be charged under the anti-terror law as his outfit was not banned in Pakistan.        
	India reacted sharply to the fresh reprieve for the 59-year-old terrorist leader, saying there was sufficient evidence to nail him.         
	We are insisting that Saeed was the brain behind the Mumbai attacks and the government of Pakistan must conduct an investigation and bring to justice all those responsible for it, Indias external affairs minister S.M. Krishna said in Bangalore.         
	Pakistan has put on trial seven suspects for the 26/11 attacks, including Zaki-ur Rehman Lakhvi, the operations chief of the Lashkar-e-Toiba. But India says Pakistan must book Saeed, the Lashkar founder who now officially heads the Jamaat-ud-Dawa, a charity front of the terror outfit.        
	Pakistans police had booked Saeed last month under the Anti-Terrorism Act for allegedly inciting people to wage jihad against infidels and seeking funds for the Dawa during speeches he made in Faisalabad in August.        
	Saeed had lodged an appeal against the cases and the Lahore High Court bench decided in his favour. The petition has been accepted and the cases are quashed, the court said in its order today.        
	The bench of Justice Asif Saeed Khosa and Justice Najamuz Zaman Saeed agreed with the arguments of Saeeds lawyer, A.K. Dogar, that since the Jamaat-ud-Dawa was not on the list of banned organisations, its leaders cannot be barred from collecting donations and making speeches. Dogar argued that Saeed was a law-abiding citizen.        
	The court admitted Saeeds petition, which contended that the FIRs were registered against him because of pressure on Pakistan from India, and ordered the quashing of the cases. The bench pointed out that the outfit Saeed heads does not figure in the first schedule of the Anti-Terrorism Act and, therefore, he could not be charged under the law.         
	During the hearing, the counsel for the Punjab government acknowledged that the Dawa was not on the list of banned terrorist groups. He said the outfit was only included in the governments watch list after the UN Security Council declared it a terrorist organisation last year. The court order punches holes in the Pakistan governments contention that the Dawa is a proscribed organisation.         
	Interior ministry chief Rehman Malik has often contended that the Dawa is banned in Pakistan, though he has been silent on whether any formal notification has been issued.        
	India says Saeed masterminded last years Mumbai terror attacks and he must be brought to book by Pakistan before the peace process can be resumed.         
	Pakistan says Saeed is being investigated and he would be arrested if solid evidence against him is found. India has repeatedly argued that it has furnished enough evidence to Pakistan on Saeeds role.        
	Pakistan detained the Jamaat leader in December, after the UN Security Council resolution put him and his charity on a list of people and organisations supporting al Qaida.

          HELENE COOPER                          (Left) Obama as he appeared before becoming the President and (right) as he looks now                                  
	Washington, March 5: Well, that didnt take long. Just 44 days into the job, and President Obama is going grey.        
	It happens to all of them, of course  Bill Clinton still had about half a head of brown hair when he took office but was a silver fox two years later, and George W. Bush went from salt and pepper to just salt in what seemed like a blink of an eye.         
	But so soon? I started noticing it towards the end of the campaign and leading up to inauguration, says Deborah Willis, who, as co-author of Obama: The Historic Campaign in Photographs, pored through 5,000 photographs of the first head over the last year.        
	Obamas greying is still of the flecked variety, and appears to wax and wane depending on when he gets his hair cut, which he does about every two weeks. His grey hairs are most prominent around his temples and atop his head, visible more clearly just before his regular trims.        
	Theories abound as to why human hair turns grey. A team of European scientists advanced the latest one last week: Going grey, they say, is caused by wear and tear of hair follicles, which creates a massive build-up of hydrogen peroxide that blocks the normal synthesis of melamin  the natural pigment of human hair. It bleaches the pigment from within, which turns hair grey.        
	Obamas barber, who goes by only one name, Zariff, takes umbrage with bloggers who alternately claim Obama, 47, is dyeing his hair grey (to appear more distinguished) or dyeing it black (to appear younger). I can tell you that his hair is 100 per cent natural, Zariff said.         
	And for all his 16 years giving Obama his quo vadis haircut  black parlance from the 1960s for close-cut locks  Zariff said he is not about to start ribbing Obama.        
	 For a guy who prides himself on projecting a stress-free demeanour, the changes above his temples are speckled evidence that perhaps the psychological and physical strains of the job  never mind the long process of winning it  are in fact taking something of a toll.        
	Obama seems to have noticed it at least as far back as last summer. Ive been running for President for about 19 months now, he told supporters at a campaign event in Virginia in August. Folks are noticing that Ive got a lot more grey hair now than when I started.        
	But with the economy struggling, two wars raging and countless other pressures facing him, the President is very likely to see additional signs of wear and tear in the mirror each morning.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Violent protests deepen Pak turmoil
                                                                                                               Violent protests deepen Pak turmoil
                              Firefighters try to control a blaze that broke out at the Marriott Hotel in Islamabad on Thursday. The fire erupted five months after a suicide truck bomber killed 55 people at the hotel. There were no reports of any deaths in the fire. However, a doctor said 12 to 15 people had been hurt. Islamabads top administrator Kamran Lashari said the fire was apparently caused by an electrical short-circuit. (AFP)                            
	Lahore, Feb. 26 (Reuters): Thousands of supporters of former Pakistan Premier Nawaz Sharif protested today, a day after a court ruling to exclude him and his brother from elected office raised fears of renewed political turmoil.        
	The nuclear-armed US ally appeared set for a power struggle after the supreme court ruling that also brought down a provincial government controlled by Opposition leader Sharif, President Asif Ali Zardaris main rival.        
	Sharif told a rally of several thousand supportes near the eastern city of Lahore, the capital of Punjab province and the Sharifs power-base, that the people rejected the bogus court ruling, for which he said Zardari was responsible.        
	The decisions of the masses have always been trampled either by judges or dictators, Sharif told the crowd.        
	Today the decision of the people has to be accepted... well see who dares defy this decision of the people.        
	The court decision to nullify the election last year of Sharifs younger brother, Shahbaz, as Punjabs chief minister and to leave in place an electoral ban on Nawaz raised fears of a return to the turbulence of the 1990s, a decade that ended in a military takeover.        
	Mostly peaceful protests were held across Punjab today but police fired tear gas to disperse a crowd that torched cars on the outskirts of Islamabad. Protesters stoned a bank in the town of Multan.        
	Pakistan can ill afford the distraction of political turmoil. The economy is only afloat thanks to an IMF loan and Islamist militants threaten security.        
	The court decision wiped 5 per cent off share values on the Karachi market yesterday and the index fell 3 per cent early today.         
	But it recovered and ended up on IMF comment about the possibility of easing monetary policy.        
	In Lahore, about 3,000 Sharif supporters took to the streets outside the provincial assembly burning tyres and chanting anti-government slogans. Police had earlier sealed off the Assembly to stop Sharif party members, who hold a majority of seats, holding a debate.        
	He has triggered a war which he cant control, Sharif party politician Rana Ijaz Ahmed Khan told the crowd, referring to Zardari. Weve accepted it as a challenge and will teach power-hungry Zardari a lesson.        
	A showdown between Zardari, widower of assassinated former Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto, and two-time Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif has been brewing since they forced former army chief Pervez Musharraf to quit as President last August.        
	Zardari imposed governors rule, or direct rule by his representative, in Punjab for two months late yesterday. Zardaris party dismissed any suggestion of the Presidents involvement in the court ruling and said it should not be exploited to derail national reconciliation.

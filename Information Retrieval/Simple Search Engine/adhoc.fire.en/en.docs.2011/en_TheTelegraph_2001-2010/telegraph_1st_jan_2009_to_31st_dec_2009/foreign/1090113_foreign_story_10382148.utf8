The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Khan sanctions
                                                                                                               Khan sanctions
                            
	Washington, Jan. 12 (AP): The US today slapped sanctions on people and companies connected to the black market nuclear network led by Pakistani scientist Abdul Qadeer Khan.        
	US officials called the sanctions a warning to other would-be proliferators and urged the world to remain vigilant to make sure Khans associates are stopped from leaking sensitive nuclear information or equipment in the future.        
	The state and treasury departments said the US had placed sanctions on 13 people and three private companies for their involvement in Khans network, which leaked atomic secrets to Iran, Libya and North Korea.        
	Those hit with sanctions include British, German, Turkish, Swiss and Sri Lankan nationals. Any bank accounts or other financial assets found in the US that belong to those designated will be frozen. Americans also are prohibited from doing business with them.        
	Khan, the architect of Pakistans atomic weapons programme, confessed in 2004 to playing a major role in the international nuclear smuggling ring.         
	With the assistance of Khans network, countries could leapfrog the slow, incremental stages of other nuclear weapons development programmes, the state department said. The networks actions have irrevocably changed the proliferation landscape and have had lasting implications for international security. quot;

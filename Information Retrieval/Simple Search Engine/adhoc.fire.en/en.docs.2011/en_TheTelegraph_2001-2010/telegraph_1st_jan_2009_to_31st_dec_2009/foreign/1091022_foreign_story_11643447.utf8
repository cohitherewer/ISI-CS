	Dhaka, Oct. 21 (Reuters): About a dozen people were injured when unidentified attackers threw a bomb as a Bangladesh MP was getting into his car today, police and witnesses said.        
	They said Fazle Noor Tapas, a legislator from the ruling Awami League party of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, escaped unhurt in the evening attack. About 12 people were injured, one witness said by telephone from the scene of the attack outside the MPs office in the citys Motijheel district.        
	Police said eight people were taken to hospital.        
	Tapas, a lawyer, is related to Hasina. He lost his father, Sheikh Fazlul Haque Moni, during a 1975 army rebellion in which Hasinas father and the countrys founding leader, Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, was killed, along with most members of his family.

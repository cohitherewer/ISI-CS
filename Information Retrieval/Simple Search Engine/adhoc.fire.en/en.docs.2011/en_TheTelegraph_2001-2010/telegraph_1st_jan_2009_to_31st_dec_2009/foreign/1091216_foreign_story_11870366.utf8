	Manila, Dec. 15 (Reuters): Philippine authorities started evacuating about 50,000 people from around the countrys most active volcano today as it spewed burning mud and rocks. Mayon volcano, famed for its near-perfect cone shape, started to release lava this week and vulcanologists are expecting a major eruption.

	Late letter    
	 Berlin, March 12 (Reuters): A German mathematician who died 450 years ago has been sent a letter demanding that he pay long-overdue television licence fees, residents at his former address said yesterday.      
	Germanys GEZ broadcast fee collection office sent the bill to the last home address of Adam Ries, an algebra expert who bought the house in 1525. A club in his honour was set up at the property four centuries later. We received a letter saying: To Mr Adam Ries on it, with the request to pay his TV and radio fees, said Annegret Muench, who now heads the club.

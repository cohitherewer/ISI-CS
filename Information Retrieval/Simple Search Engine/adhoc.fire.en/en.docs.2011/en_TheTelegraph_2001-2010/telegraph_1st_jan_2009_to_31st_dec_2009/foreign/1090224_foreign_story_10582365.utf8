	Los Angeles, Feb. 23: What a change 24 hours make. On Saturday at a Slumdog Millionaires drinks party at her hotel, cover girl Freida Pinto was in black motorcycle leathers but for last nights Oscar red carpet, she wore an electric blue Galliano fishtail outfit. Her jewellery was Indian, said to be 150 years.        
	It is bare on one shoulder and fitted up to the hip and then it flares into a fishtail cut, said one fashion expert who was not entirely convinced by Freidas choice.        
	 For many others, the choice fell on asymmetrical and strapless gowns in neutral shades of black, white and grey. Recurring mermaid and fairy-style themes also added to the Hollywood glamour, along with occasional flashes of bright colours.        
	Kate Winslet, who won Best Actress, picked a long grey and black, off-the-shoulder Yves Saint Laurent satin and tulle gown by Stefano Pilati. She finished off her outfit with a modern twist on a 1940s swept-back hairstyle.        
	 But, apart from a few other bursts of colour  in particular reds and pinks, notably worn by actress Natalie Portman and model Heidi Klum  the glittering ceremony featured an array of more conservative blacks, whites and greys.        
	 Meryl Streep chose a light grey Alberta Ferretti long-sleeved dress which rested just below the shoulders.        
	Angelina Jolie was in a sweetheart-necked black strapless gown by Elie Saab, Halle Berry in a strapless, fishtail mermaid Marchesa dress with gold embroidery and British actress Kate Beckinsale, who continued the asymmetrical theme with her one-shouldered choice.        
	 Penelope Cruz arrived in a white vintage gown with silver embroidery, designed by Pierre Balmain. The sixty-year-old ruched chiffon dress had a touch of the bridal about it but was saved by her understated hair and make-up.        
	 With a sweetheart neckline in common with many other celebrities who took their turn at the 81st Annual Academy Awards, the strapless dress featured gold embroidery and a full skirt.        
	 Sex And The Citys Sarah Jessica Parker picked a floaty, strapless dress. One paper said she took up half the red carpet in her frothy over-the-top Dior gown. The pale green full-skirted dress was topped off with tight corset that showed off her tiny waist but failed to control her ample figure.        
	 The pale theme continued among actresses including Australian Melissa George, who adopted a quot;mermaid quot; look with a white Dolce and Gabbana dress, and Taraji Henson  who was nominated for an Oscar for The Curious Case of Benjamin Button  in a cream strapless, tiered gown by Roberto Cavalli.        
	 Vikas Swarup, the author of Q amp;A, wore a formal dark gula bundh while his wife Aparna had brought an embroidered black sari made by a woman in in Varansai who designs for the erstwhile royal family of Nepal.        
	 The Slumdog by actors wore tuxedos, the two girls frocks. Rubina had mehndi on her hands.

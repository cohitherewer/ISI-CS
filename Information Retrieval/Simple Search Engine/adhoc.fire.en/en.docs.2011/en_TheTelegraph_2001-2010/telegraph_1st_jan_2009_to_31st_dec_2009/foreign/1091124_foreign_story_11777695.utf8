	London, Nov. 23 (AP): Margaret Thatcher returned to 10, Downing Street for good today  in the form of a portrait installed at the official residence of Britains Prime Minister.        
	Thatcher, Prime Minister from 1979 to 1990, joined Premier Gordon Brown and David Cameron, a successor to Thatcher as Conservative Party leader, at 10, Downing Street to unveil the work.

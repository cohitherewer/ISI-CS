	Los Angeles, June 27 (AP): The cliche is that rock stars want to be movie stars, and movie stars want to be rock stars. Michael Jackson was content to be the King of Pop.        
	Unlike the Beatles, Elvis Presley, Frank Sinatra, Madonna and others in the music pantheon, Jackson made only a few forays onto the big screen, most notably co-starring as the Scarecrow alongside Diana Ross as Dorothy in 1978s The Wiz, a musical adaptation of The Wizard of Oz.        
	Movies might have seemed a natural next mountain to scale for Jackson after reaching the peak of his stardom in the 1980s era of dance flicks such as Footloose and Flashdance.        
	But after The Wiz, Jackson generally stuck to pioneering moves in music videos, with the occasional feature-film cameo or appearance in specialty films or TV shows.        
	Film composer Bruce Broughton, who wrote music for Jacksons 1988 song, dance and fantasy extravaganza, Moonwalker, said it likely was the singers own choice to give the big-screen a pass. If you look at the energy of his music, his vocals and the physicality of it, thats a full-time job. Thats like two or three guys wrapped into one, Broughton said. To put out that kind of energy, he probably figured he had as much as he wanted creatively in the music. The critical drubbing The Wiz received also may have soured Jackson on a side career in film.

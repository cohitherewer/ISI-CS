                              Bausch                            
	Berlin, June 30 (Reuters): German choreographer Pina Bausch, whose work is credited with revolutionising the language of modern dance, died today after being diagnosed with cancer only days earlier. She was 68 years old.        
	Bausch, artistic director of the Wuppertal Dance Theatre, earned world renown for her avant-garde performances and choreographies mixing dance, sound and fragmented narrative.        
	Just the Sunday before last, she was standing on stage with her company in the Wuppertal Opera house, the dance-theatre company, which she had led since 1973, said on its website.        
	It said Pausch had been diagnosed with cancer only five days before her death.

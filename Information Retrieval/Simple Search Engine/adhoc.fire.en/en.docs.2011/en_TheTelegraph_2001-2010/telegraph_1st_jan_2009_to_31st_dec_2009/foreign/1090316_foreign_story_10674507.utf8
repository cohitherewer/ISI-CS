The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Taliban torch US trucks to Afghanistan
                                                                                                               Taliban torch US trucks to Afghanistan
                            
	Peshawar, March 15 (Reuters): Pakistani Taliban set fire to 20 trucks carrying supplies to western forces in Afghanistan today, the first major attack on a vital supply route through Pakistan in several months, police said.        
	Militants stepped up attacks on the road through northwest Pakistan into land-locked Afghanistan last year, exposing the vulnerability of western supply links just as the US was planning a surge of troops to tackle the Taliban.        
	The trucks torched early today were parked at a depot on the outskirts of Peshawar.        
	They came in the dark and threw petrol bombs as a result of which 20 containers and trucks caught fire. They then opened fire while running away, senior police officer Ejaz Abid said. Two guards were wounded, he said.        
	Abid said the trucks contained food while a witness said military vehicles were also being transported to the border.        
	The US defence department says the US military sends 75 per cent of supplies for the Afghan war through or over Pakistan, including 40 per cent of the fuel for its troops.        
	The route from Peshawar up to the border through the Khyber Pass is the most important of two routes through Pakistan. The US has been trying to find new supply routes for its troops after the increase in militant attacks on convoys through Pakistan.        
	The US said this month it expected to finalise an agreement with Tajikistan that would allow the transit of non-lethal supplies to Afghanistan.

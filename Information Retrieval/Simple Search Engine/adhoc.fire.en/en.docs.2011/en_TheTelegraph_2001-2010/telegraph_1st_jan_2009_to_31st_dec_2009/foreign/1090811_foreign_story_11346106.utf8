	Feeding friends    
	 Los Angeles, Aug. 10 (PTI): Actress Jennifer Aniston says that her celebrity friends prefer her home-cooked food over expensive gourmet cuisine as her personal chef is the best in town.       
	The 40-year-old actress, whose friends include Spiderman star Toby Maguire, Friends co-star Courtney Cox and 300 star Gerard Butler, said her home is their favourite eating joint and, therefore, she never has to dine alone, reports People magazine. My friends love coming over, because they get fed, said Aniston.

	Kevin date    
	 London (PTI): Oscar- winning actor Kevin Costner is auctioning himself off for a dinner date to raise money for the children of a woman who died at a Canadian music festival. The actor and his band Modern West were just about to perform at the Big Valley Jamboree in Alberta, Canada, earlier this month when a tornado brought the stage down, killing Donna Moore, 35, and leaving 80 injured. Costner had said that he would return to Alberta to play a benefit concert.

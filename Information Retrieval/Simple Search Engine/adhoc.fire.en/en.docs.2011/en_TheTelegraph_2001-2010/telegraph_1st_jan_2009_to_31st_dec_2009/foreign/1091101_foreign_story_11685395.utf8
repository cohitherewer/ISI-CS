	Hayek horror    
	 Los Angeles, Oct. 31 (PTI): Actress Salma Hayek regrets having grown a moustache for her role in Frida as she has to keep waxing her upper lip now.       
	The Mexican actress was afraid that she would not look convincing in the role of artist Frida Kahlo with a fake hairy upper lip, so she started shaving her face in a bid to have the bristles grow back thicker and darker, reports Globe magazine.      
	Now, the 43-year-old actress is unable to keep her hair from growing and is worried that she would look like a bandit when she grows older.     
	Diaz debut    
	 London (PTI): Actress Cameron Diaz almost missed out on her big break in The Mask as she felt too bloated to wear a sexy dress for the audition. The Charlies Angels star said that she nearly missed the audition for the part of Tina alongside actor Jim Carrey in the 1994 film because she did not feel confident enough to wear a sexy dress.

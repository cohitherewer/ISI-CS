	Islamabad, March 26: Pakistan president Asif Ali Zardari has invited chief justice Iftikhar Mohammad Chaudhry to a dinner on Monday, a week after his reinstatement as the countrys top judge.         
	While Supreme Court officials did not confirm whether Chaudhry will attend the dinner, speculations was rife in Islamabad that he will accept the invitation.         
	Chaudhry had announced two years ago that he would stay away from such events and urged high court judges to follow his example.         
	Zardaris dinner invitation follows a tradition in Pakistan government circles to welcome new chief justices, armed forces chiefs and lawmakers. Chaudhry had also politely refused to attend an awards ceremony at the Presidential residence on March 23.         
	Court registrar Faqir Hussain said the chief justice was busy reading files of cases that will come up for hearing soon.         
	The top judge had decided to stop meeting the President, the Prime Minister and attending social gatherings after he was reinstated by a Supreme Court bench on July 20, 2007. The bench had declared a presidential reference for misuse of powers against him as illegal.         
	Relations between Chaudhry and the previous government had become strained after he stopped the privatisation of the multi-million dollar Pakistan Steel Mills in 2006, describing the deal as non-transparent.         
	Chaudhry was ousted by former President Pervez Musharraf just months after his judgment and a reference for misuse of powers was sent to the Supreme Judicial Council against him on March 9, 2007. The situation did not improve even after he was reinstated in July. Musharraf sacked 60 judges, including Chaudhry, and imposed emergency in November 2007 as he felt that the court might overturn his victory in the presidential election.

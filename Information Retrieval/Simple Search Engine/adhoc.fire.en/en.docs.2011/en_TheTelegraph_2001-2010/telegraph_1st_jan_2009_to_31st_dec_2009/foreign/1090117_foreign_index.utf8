                                                                                                                                          America is marvelling at a miraculous combination in which a pilot emergency-landed an apparently geese-hit Airbus A320 in the icy Hudson river and a flotilla of vessels converged fast to pluck all 155 people aboard to safety.                 New York feted its latest hero, the pilot who landed the distressed US Airways jetliner on the Hudson river, saving all 155 on board in what experts called a masterful job un                   Police divers found two women, going limp, with minutes to live in the icy waters between New York and New Jersey.                             The US Airways plane descends on its way to an emergency ditching in the Hudson river on Thursday.

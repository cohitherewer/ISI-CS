The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | US chat show host hurt during stunt

	London, Sept. 26: Conan Brien, the host of the US talk show, Tonight, was taken to hospital in Los Angeles after hitting his head in a stunt that forced producers to broadcast a repeat.        
	The comedian was hurt during recording of the NBC programme yesterday. The network said Brien, who took over from long-standing host Jay Leno in June, was being examined at a hospital and that the show was not finished, forcing them to broadcast a repeat of an older edition instead.        
	There was no comment on the 46-year-olds condition or whether he had been released. Brien issued a statement through NBC that indicated he was treating the incident lightly.        
	Last thing I remember I was enjoying the play with Mrs Lincoln, and the next thing I knew I was in bed being served cookies and juice Brien said in the statement.        
	There was no word from NBC on plans for next weeks shows.         
	NBCs decision to remove the popular Leno from Tonight and replace him with Brien, hoping to draw a younger audience, put pressure on the new hosts shoulders.

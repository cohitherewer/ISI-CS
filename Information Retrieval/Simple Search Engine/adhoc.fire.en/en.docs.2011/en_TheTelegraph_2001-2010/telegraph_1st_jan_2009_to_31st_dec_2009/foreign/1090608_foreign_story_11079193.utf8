	Botox boost    
	 Miami, June 7: Job hunting in recession-hit US is a tough assignment. It takes more than a spruced-up CV, a tidy haircut or a smart new suit to stand out from the crowd these days, reports The Sunday Telegraph.       
	But doctors in the US have found a new way to give the unemployed a leg-up with a Botox bailout, offering thousands of dollars worth of free Botox injections, liposuctions and other cosmetic procedures to ensure they look their very best  and perhaps a little more youthful  at interviews.      
	If people feel good about themselves, they look younger, they are more confident and they make a better impression to a prospective employer, said Jason Shapiro, who practices cosmetic medicine in Fort Lauderdale, Florida.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Facebook increases cancer risk
                                                                                                               Facebook increases cancer risk
                            
	London, Feb. 19 (PTI): Are you a frequent visitor to social networking sites like Facebook or MySpace? Then there is some bad news for you.        
	 A report in a science journal has claimed that logging on these sites frequently could increase the risk of cancer and other major illness such as strokes, heart disease and dementia.         
	Emailing people rather than meeting up with them may have wide-ranging biological effects, psychologist Aric Sigman says in his report published in the Biologist.        
	Increased isolation could alter the way genes work and upset immune responses, hormone levels and the function of arteries. It could also impair mental performance, which could increase the risk of problems as serious as cancer, strokes, heart disease and dementia, the doctor was quoted as saying in the Daily Mail tabloid. Even though these sites are designed to bring people together, Sigman said they are making people more isolated.

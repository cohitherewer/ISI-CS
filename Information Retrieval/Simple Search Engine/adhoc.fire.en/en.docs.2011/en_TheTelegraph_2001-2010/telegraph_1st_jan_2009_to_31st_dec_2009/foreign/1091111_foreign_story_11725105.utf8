	Envious Eva    
	 London, Nov. 10 (PTI): Actress Eva Mendes is envious of her idol Kate Winslet because The Reader star grabs all the roles that the American actress wants to do.       
	Mendes hopes her new role in Bad Lieutenant will catch the attention of directors who want to find Hollywoods new tough girl and then maybe she will be considered for films Winslet does not accept.      
	Kate Winslet gets all the gritty roles, understandably so! She is my idol and I just think shes done it the right way, Mendes said.     
	Tyler tiff    
	 Los Angeles (Reuters): The lead guitarist with one of Americas most successful rock groups, Aerosmith, said on Monday that he and his bandmates were positively looking for a new singer to work with, following a rift with frontman Steven Tyler. Joe Perry, 59, made the announcement on his Twitter page, ratcheting up an unusually public feud with his songwriting partner of 40 years.

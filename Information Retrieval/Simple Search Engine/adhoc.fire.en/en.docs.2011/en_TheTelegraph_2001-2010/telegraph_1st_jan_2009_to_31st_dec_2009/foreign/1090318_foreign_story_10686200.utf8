The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Good for Pak but pitfalls lurk
                                                                                                               Good for Pak but pitfalls lurk
          ZULFIQAR AHMAD                           Iftikhar Chaudhry. (AFP)                                  
	The comment of the young driver  Javed from Abbottabad  came unsolicited, without context and with a slight question mark at the end. I was in a taxi on my way to Karachi airport to take a flight to New Delhi.        
	That was good what happened.        
	After a pause, during which I only added a brief yes, the driver sighed and added, talking more to himself than to me: Maybe, we will get lucky this time.         
	He did not need to add anything more. From his periodic yawns, it was clear that he, like me, had stayed up through the night to witness the victorious end of a truly remarkable and historically unique five days in the history of Pakistan.        
	Just three weeks ago, when I first arrived in Karachi from the US, the talk was all about the lawyers long march and dharna to hold the Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) government to its promise of reinstating the Chief Justice Iftikhar Chaudhry and his fellow judges who were unconstitutionally dismissed by General Pervez Musharraf in 2007. Almost everyone involved in the march expected a hard road to Islamabad and a yet more painful sit-in in front of Parliament House.        
	And then, like many before him, President Asif Ali Zardari, became either scared of the lawyers march, or over-confident of his power, and decided to take some stupid actions.        
	Following a Supreme Court decision holding the chief minister of Punjab, Shabaz Sharif, incompetent to hold his office, he immediately dismissed the Punjab government of former Prime Minister Nawaz Sharifs Pakistan Muslim League (PML-N) and imposed governors rule in the province.        
	In the history of Pakistan, no elected government in Islamabad has ever dismissed the Punjab Assembly. Punjab, long used to being the most powerful province, did not take Zardaris highhandedness lightly. The PML-N has strong support in Punjab. It was able to quickly mobilise by aligning itself with the deeply popular lawyers movement.        
	It is a testimony to the resilience, courage, integrity, and immense popular appeal of the two-year-long struggle of the lawyers that it was not just the PML-N but conservative parties (like the Jamiat-e-Islam and Sunni Tehrik) that decided to join the long march on a one-point agenda of restoring an independent judiciary.        
	The struggle of democratic forces  lawyers and members of progressive civil society in particular  has given the major political parties of Pakistan another chance to develop a stable and effective government.         
	The victory, however, has its cost. President Zardaris extremely aggressive, but failed, actions to stop the long march, and his stubborn refusal to accept lawyers demands until very late in the march may have some serious consequences.        
	First, Zardaris brinkmanship forced the indirect, but very strong and visible, intervention by the army. General Ashfaq Parvez Kayanis refusal to intervene directly, and his role in getting the President to back down and avert a direct confrontation with the protesters has restored some of the image and legitimacy of the army as an institution that has the countrys best interests at heart. Many in Pakistans media were unjustifiably going so far as to even credit the army for restoring Justice Iftikhar Chaudary!         
	Second, the PML-N and PPP confrontation almost became a Sindh-versus-Punjab issue. Unless the two parties take great care not to needlessly antagonise each other, it is likely that the Sindh-Punjab rift will widen. Given that significant sections of Pakistan  in Swat, North West, and Baluchistan  have already freed themselves from Pakistan, a Sindh-Punjab rivalry could make for an unviable nation-state.        
	Finally, the absence of a stable and operative democratic government in Islamabad would mean that the Pakistani state will not be able to effectively challenge the growing power and influence of Islamist forces in increasingly large areas of Pakistan.         
	There are no quick and easy solutions to the Islamist radicalism in Pakistan; only a longer term strategy that is informed by good analysis, is sensitive to local variations, can balance military and non-military interventions, and weather periodic setbacks, will have a chance of success.         
	At the moment, Punjab and Sindh are both far from falling into Taliban hands, but one can observe the increasing presence of Islamist forces in Pakistans major cities. If the major political parties fail to use this moment of political revitalisation to work together, their tenure will be short-lived indeed and future of the country uncertain.        
	What happened on Monday in Pakistan is good indeed. But as I got out of the taxi, I become acutely aware of the question that Javed, the driver, had not said aloud: Do we dare to hope?

	New York, June 16: As the embattled government of President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad appears to be trying to limit Internet access and communications in Iran, new kinds of social media are challenging those traditional levers of state control.         
	Iranians are blogging, posting to Facebook and, most visibly, coordinating their protests on Twitter, the messaging service. Their activity has increased, not decreased, since the presidential election on Friday and ensuing attempts by the government to restrict or censor their online communications.         
	On Twitter, reports and links to photos from a peaceful mass march in Tehran yesterday, along with accounts of street fighting and casualties around the country, have become the most popular topic on the service worldwide, according to Twitters published statistics.         
	A couple of Twitter feeds have become virtual media offices for the supporters of the leading Opposition candidate, Mir Hussein Mousavi. One feed, mousavi1388 (1388 is the year in the Persian calendar), is filled with news of protests and exhortations to keep up the fight, in Persian and in English. It has more than 7,000 followers. Moussavis fan group on Facebook has swelled to over 50,000 members.         
	Acknowledging its role on the global stage, the San Francisco-based company said yesterday that it was delaying a planned shutdown for maintenance for a day, citing the role Twitter is currently playing as an important communication tool in Iran. Twitter users are posting messages with the term IranElection, which allows users to search for all tweets on the subject.

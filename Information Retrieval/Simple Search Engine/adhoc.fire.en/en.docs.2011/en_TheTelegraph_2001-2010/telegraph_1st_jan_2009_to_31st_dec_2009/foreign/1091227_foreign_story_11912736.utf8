The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Left in UK trains: cat, octopus and shotgun
                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      Left in UK trains: cat, octopus and shotgun
                          Abandoned                          
	London, Dec. 26: A dead octopus, a cat and part of a shotgun are among the items passengers have left on trains this year, according to rail companies.        
	Hundreds of items are handed into the lost property offices at stations by rail workers who find them abandoned on trains. Mobile phones and jackets are among the most commonly forgotten items.        
	But items that might seem difficult to forget included a bag containing a dead octopus handed in at Edinburgh.        
	A cat was left on a train going from Cardonald to Glasgow, and one passenger also left half of a shotgun on a London to Glasgow train during the summer.        
	Staff called police, who took it away and the guns owner was told to contact the officers when he phoned to say he had lost his gun. Other recent finds include a hockey stick and a wheelchair, while two clarinets and two violins caused confusion when they were both handed in on the same day.

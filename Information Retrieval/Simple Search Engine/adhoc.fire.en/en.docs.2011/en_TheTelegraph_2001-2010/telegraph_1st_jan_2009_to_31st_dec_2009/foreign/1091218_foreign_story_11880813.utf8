                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      Foreign trip bar on Pak minister
          NASIR JAFFRY AND AGENCIES                                     
	Islamabad, Dec. 17: Pakistans anti-corruption agency, the National Accountability Bureau (NAB), today asked the interior ministry to bar 248 people, including interior minister Rehman Malik, from travelling abroad.        
	The NAB also revived cases against 8,014 politicians and bureaucrats who were protected by the 2007 amnesty known as the National Reconciliation Ordinance (NRO). Last night, the Supreme Court rejected the ordinance that protected President Asif Ali Zardari from graft charges.        
	All the criminal and graft cases are also being re-opened in the light of the judgment announced by the Supreme Court last night, a senior government official told The Telegraph.        
	An NAB spokesman said the bureau had asked the interior ministry to place the names of all NRO beneficiaries on the Exit Control List, a move that will bar them from travelling abroad. He did not reveal the names of those who were on the list.        
	However, TV news channels reported that the ministry had included Malik, whose conviction was quashed under the NRO, in the list. The spokesman said Zardaris name was not on the list as he is still shielded by presidential immunity.         
	Other than Malik, defence minister Ahmed Mukhtar and minister for overseas Pakistanis Farooq Sattar are also on the list. Bank accounts and properties of all NRO beneficiaries had been sealed, officials said.        
	Immediately after last nights court order, Zardaris spokesmen said the Presidents ruling Pakistan Peoples Party respected the decision but there was no question of the Zardari resigning.        
	However, a senior leader of the main Opposition party said Zardari should do the right thing and step down.        
	He should quit this office in his own interest as well as in the interest of his party and the system.         
	He can get any member of his party elected to the post, said Khawaja Mohammad Asif of the Pakistan Muslim League (Nawaz) party.        
	A brief statement issued by Prime Minister Yousaf Raza Gilanis office said the government respects the judgement of the Supreme Court and is awaiting the detailed judgement. Officials said Gilani plans to replace all ministers who benefited from the NRO.

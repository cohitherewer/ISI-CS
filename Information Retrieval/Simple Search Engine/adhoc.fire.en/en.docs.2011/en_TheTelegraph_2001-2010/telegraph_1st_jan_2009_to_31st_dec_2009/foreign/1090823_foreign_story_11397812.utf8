The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | President may attend Chelsea marriage
                                                                                                               President may attend Chelsea marriage
                              Chelsea: Total secrecy                            
	Washington, Aug. 22: Chelsea Clinton and her fiance could marry at Marthas Vineyard in the next couple of days, according to reports.        
	Speculation is rife in the US that Clinton, 29, and her investment banker fiance Marc Mezvinsky, 31, are to marry at a service on the exclusive east coast island that will coincide with the arrival of President Barack Obama and his family for their summer vacation.        
	The daughter of the US secretary of state, Hillary Clinton, and the former President, Bill Clinton, is said to be planning the wedding on the estate owned by the actors Ted Danson and Mary Steenburgen near the Obama residence. Oprah Winfrey as well as other former Presidents are also rumoured to be among the wedding guests.        
	Hillary Clinton and US state department officials have denied the rumours but the Washington Post said that all involved had been ordered to keep quiet about the details of the wedding, which could be held as early as tomorrow.        
	Locals on the island have claimed that the number of Secret Service agents has increased dramatically in the last few days, but that comes as little surprise given that Obama, his wife Michelle and their daughters Sasha and Malia are due to arrive tomorrow to begin a 10-day vacation.        
	However, there are also reports that caterers and Hillary Clintons hairdresser have been engaged to visit the island.        
	The Clintons left Bermuda on Thursday, where they had begun a holiday.                    THE DAILY TELEGRAPH

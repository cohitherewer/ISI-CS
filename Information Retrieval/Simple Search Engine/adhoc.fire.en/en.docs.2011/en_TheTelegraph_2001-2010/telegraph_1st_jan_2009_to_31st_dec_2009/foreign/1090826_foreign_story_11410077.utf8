	Ageing musical    
	 London, Aug. 25 (Reuters): The Who guitarist Pete Townshend, behind rock operas Tommy and Quadrophenia, is writing a new musical Floss about getting old.      
	As a 19-year-old, with My Generation, I wrote the most explicitly ageist song in rock, Townshend wrote on his bands website (www.thewho.com). The 1965 hit song includes the line I hope I die before I get old.      
	At 64, I now want to take on ageing and mortality, using the powerfully angry context of rock roll. Townshend expects it to be ready for a concert premiere in 2011, probably in New York.

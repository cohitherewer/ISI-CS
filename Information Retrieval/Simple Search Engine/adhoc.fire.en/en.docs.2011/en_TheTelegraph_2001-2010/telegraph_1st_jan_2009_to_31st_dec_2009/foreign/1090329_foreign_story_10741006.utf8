	Haunted Jackson    
	 London, March 28 Michael Jackson will live close to haunted caves when he rents a country house for the duration of his concerts in London this summer, reports The Daily Telegraph.       
	The eccentric singer is reported to have paid 1 million to rent a large country house near the edge of an ancient 22-mile maze of haunted passageways.       
	The undisclosed home is thought to be close to the Chislehurst Caves in Bromley, in the southeast suburbs of London. Ghost sightings have been reported at the caves, which were dug in chalk by the Saxons, Druids and Romans.     
	Baby care    
	 London: A prison work crew looked after a toddler who was spotted on Friday running along the centre of a rural motorway in Maryland as trucks loaded with gravel rumbled by, police and correctional officials said. The six inmates shared their lunches with the boy, who apparently had wandered away from home, and played with him while authorities located the boys parents, said Gary Kershner, a correctional officer.

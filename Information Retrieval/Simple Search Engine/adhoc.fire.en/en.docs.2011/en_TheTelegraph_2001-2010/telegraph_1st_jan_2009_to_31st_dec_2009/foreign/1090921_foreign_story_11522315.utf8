	Islamabad, Sept. 20 (Agencies): An arrested Pakistani Taliban commander, who was accused of capturing and beheading members of security forces in the northwestern Swat valley, died in hospital today.        
	Security forces captured Sher Mohammad Qasab in a raid near Swats main town, Mingora, on Wednesday. The militant was wounded while his three sons were killed in an exchange of fire.        
	He was severely wounded. We tried to save his life, but he succumbed to his wounds early this morning, said military spokesperson Lieutenant-Colonel Akhtar Abbas.        
	A team of army doctors was treating Qasab but he could not survive, he added.        
	Qasab, who was carrying a reward of Pakistani Rs 10 million on his head offered by the NWFP government, was a close aide of Maulana Fazlullah, the chief of the Taliban in Swat.        
	Qasab was the third high-profile Taliban commander to be arrested in Swat after militant spokesperson Muslim Khan and commander Mahmood Khan. Security officials said Qasab was responsible for setting on fire girls schools in Swat. They said he also ran a slaughter centre in Charbagh, a former Taliban stronghold in Swat.

          NICK PISA                           Patrizia DAddario                                  
	Rome, July 30: An escort girl at the centre of a sex scandal involving the Italian Prime Minister is to host a themed party entitled I Love Silvio at a historic Paris nightclub.         
	Patrizia DAddario, 42, grabbed international headlines last month after claiming she and other women had been paid to attend parties at Berlusconis homes. Last week transcripts of DAddario praising Berlusconi for his sexual performance were also published in Italian newspapers.        
	Tomorrow, DAddario, who also claims that she was offered a seat as an MEP with Berlusconis Forza Italia party, will host a special Italian party at the Globo disco in the French capital.        
	A leaflet advertising the event, subtitled, In the year of the divorce, shows pictures of Berlusconi, DAddario, the Colosseum and the Leaning Tower of Pisa and includes the Premiers quote that Right-wing women are more beautiful and competent.        
	Berlusconi claims he cannot remember DAddario. He has also said he cannot understand people who pay for sex without the thrill of the conquest.                            THE DAILY TELEGRAPH

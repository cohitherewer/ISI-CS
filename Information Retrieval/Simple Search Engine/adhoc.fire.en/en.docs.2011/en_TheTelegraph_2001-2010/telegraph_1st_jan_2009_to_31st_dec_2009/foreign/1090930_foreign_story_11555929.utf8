The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | 246 killed in Filipino typhoon
                                                                                                               246 killed in Filipino typhoon
                            
	Manila, Sept. 29 (Reuters): Philippine authorities braced today for another storm as the toll from Typhoon Ketsana rose to 246 killed and the cost of the damage climbed to nearly $100 million.        
	Ketsana dumped more than a months worth of average rainfall on Manila and surrounding areas in one 24-hour period. About 80 per cent of the city of 15 million was flooded. The Philippine government has come in for scathing criticism for its response, with many calling it inadequate and delayed.        
	Authorities estimated damage from the storm so far at around 4.69 billion pesos ($98.5 million). More than 1.9 million people were affected and 375,000 had abandoned their homes and taken refuge in evacuation centres. More than 3,000 houses were either damaged or destroyed.        
	The Philippine death toll could rise further once reports come in from remote areas, disaster officials said. The storm hit metropolitan Manila and 12 provinces. Dozens remained missing and feared dead.

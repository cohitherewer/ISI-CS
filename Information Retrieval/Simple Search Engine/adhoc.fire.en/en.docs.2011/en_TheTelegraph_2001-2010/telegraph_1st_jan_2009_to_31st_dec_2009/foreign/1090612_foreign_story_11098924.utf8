	Tehran, June 11 (AP): In the final hours of Irans fierce election campaign, the top pro-reform challenger to President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad got a sharp warning that authorities would crush any attempt at a popular revolution inspired by the huge rallies and street parties calling for more freedoms.        
	The threat made yesterday by an official of the powerful Revolutionary Guard reflected the increasingly tense atmosphere surrounding tomorrows up-for-grabs election. It also marked a sharp escalation by the ruling clerics against the youth-driven campaign of Mir Hossein Mousavi and its hopes of an underdog victory.        
	The message from the Guards political chief, Yadollah Javani, appeared to carry twin purposes: to rattle Mousavis backers just before the polls and to warn that it would not tolerate the formation of a post-election political force under the banner of Mousavis green movement  the signature colour of his campaign.        
	In a statement on the Guards website, Javani drew parallels between Mousavis campaign and the velvet revolution that led to the 1989 ouster of the communist government in then-Czechoslovakia.        
	Javani vowed that any attempt for velvet revolution will be nipped in the bud. Javani also accused the reformists of planning to claim vote rigging and provoke street violence if Mousavi loses.        
	If no candidate wins at least 50 per cent plus one vote of all ballots cast, including blank ones, a run-off round between the top two candidates is held on the first Friday after the election result is declared.

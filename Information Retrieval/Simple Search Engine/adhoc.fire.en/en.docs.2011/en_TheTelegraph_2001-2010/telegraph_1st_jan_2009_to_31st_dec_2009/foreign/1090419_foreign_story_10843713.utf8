The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Iran jails US-born journalist for 8 years
                                                                                                               Iran jails US-born journalist for 8 years
                              Roxana Saberi                            
	Tehran, April 18 (Reuters): An Iranian-American journalist accused in Iran of spying for the US has been jailed for eight years, her lawyer said today, five days after she was put on trial.        
	An Iranian judiciary official, quoted by the Isna news agency, confirmed the sentencing of Roxana Saberi, a US-born freelance reporter who has worked for the BBC and National Public Radio (NPR).         
	US secretary of state Hillary Clinton said she was very disappointed by the sentencing. Saberis jailing could become a source of US-Iranian tension at a time when Washington is trying to reach out to the Islamic Republic following three decades of mutual mistrust.        
	The judiciary earlier this week said Saberi went on trial on Monday at a Revolutionary Court, which handles security cases. She has been sentenced to eight years ... I will appeal, lawyer Abdolsamad Khorramshahi said. Isna quoted the official as saying: Branch 28 of the Revolutionary Court sentenced Roxana Saberi to eight years for espionage. She can appeal the sentence.        
	Her father, Reza Saberi, told the NPR that his daughter had been coerced into statements that she later retracted. She was deceived, he said. She is quite depressed about this matter and she wants to go on a hunger strike. And if she does, she is so frail it can be very dangerous to her health.        
	Her parents visited her in Tehrans Evin jail on April 6, after arriving from the US. Evin is a jail where rights groups say political prisoners are usually taken. According to a website set up to campaign for her release, freeroxana.net, Saberi moved to Iran six years ago. She grew up in Fargo, North Dakota.

	Islamabad, May 8 (PTI): Pakistan today offered aid to Sikhs who recently escaped from violence in the North West Frontier Province to Gurdwara Panja Sahib in Hasanabdal, Punjab.        
	The aid was distributed by the NWFP information minister, Mian Iftikhar Hussain, and minorities minister Nimroz Khanin Hasanabdal. Hussain said the NWFP government is determined to help everyone, including the minorities, who had fled from the Malakand division, which includes Swat Valley and Buner. He said the Sikh were not alone and the government was well aware of its sufferings. The aid was not enough for everyone fleeing Malakand, but it had been given so that the Sikhs could realise the government is aware of their miseries, he said.

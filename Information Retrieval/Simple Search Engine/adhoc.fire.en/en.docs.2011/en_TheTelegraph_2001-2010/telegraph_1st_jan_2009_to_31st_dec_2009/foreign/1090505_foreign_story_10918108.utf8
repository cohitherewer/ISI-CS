	Mexico City, May 4: Citing an ebb in the number of swine flu cases, Mexican officials said today that they would lower the public alert against the virus and allow most of the nations businesses to reopen this week, even as the outbreak, which appears to have started in Mexico, continued its spread worldwide.         
	In Mexico City, where most of the nations 26 deaths from the virus and more than 700 infections have been recorded, restaurants and other eateries will reopen on Wednesday.         
	Churches and museums will reopen on Thursday, but bars, nightclubs, cinemas and theatres will remain closed until further notice, The Associated Press reported.        
	Across the country, most factories and offices will reopen on Wednesday, health minister Jos ngel Crdova said in a news conference. A decision has not yet been made to reopen schools, which have remained shuttered for well over a week.        
	In another sign that the disease may not be as serious as feared, Cordova said that the flu, influenza A(H1N1), appears only slightly more contagious than the seasonal flu, less than thought. Each sufferer is, on average, passing the disease along to between 1.4 and 1.8 people, a statistic known as the R factor. The number of new cases is declining in Mexico, he said, and no deaths have been reported since April 29.        
	Swine flu is now widespread in the US, health officials said, and continues to spread globally. As of this afternoon, there were 286 confirmed cases of the disease in 36 states  up from 226 in 30 states yesterday  and more than 700 additional cases considered probable in 44 states, Dr Richard Besser, acting director of the Centres for Disease Control and Prevention, said at a news conference. Dr Besser stressed that most of the cases were mild, and added that, of the 286 confirmed cases, only 35 had resulted in hospitalisation.         
	While were not out of the woods, we are seeing some encouraging signs, he said.        
	The World Health Organisation also said today that it had counted 1,025 laboratory confirmed cases in 20 countries. Yesterday, there were 898 confirmed cases in 18 countries.        
	The lack of sustained transmission outside North America has kept the WHO from declaring a full-scale pandemic, but officials have warned nations not to let down their guard.        
	Were not quite certain about how this is going to evolve. There is always uncertainty when it comes to a new disease, Dr Keiji Fukuda, the WHOs deputy director general, said in a Monday conference call. In particular, the organisation is concerned about the diseases possible spread to the southern hemisphere, which is moving into the winter, the season most conducive to the flus spread.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Pak-origin doctor accused of UK hug
                                                                                                               Pak-origin doctor accused of UK hug
                            
	London, Oct. 6: A hospital doctor, Nabeel Bin Afzal, hugged a female patient, Patricia Blackmore, after a heart scan and then turned up on her doorstep saying he would like to talk, a disciplinary hearing was told.        
	Dr Bin Afzal has denied charges of hugging Blackmore after a heart scan at Southend Hospital. He has further denied, at a hearing of the General Medical Council in London, charges of accessing the womans medical records in order to locate her address        
	Blackmore, from south Benfleet, named only as Patient A at the hearing, said the incident had left her so distressed she had not worked for five months. Giving evidence at a hearing, Blackmore said the heart scan carried out by Dr Bin Afzal on May 8 last year had left her feeling increasingly uncomfortable about his closeness.        
	She told the hearing she had first consulted the doctor at a heart and chest clinic at the hospital earlier that day after being referred for a scan following a diagnosis of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.        
	She told the hearing she had felt elated after being given the all-clear following the scan. She denied an accusation by George Thomas, defending Dr Bin Afzal, that she had given the doctor a hug following the scan. I went to shake the doctors hand and he gave me a hug, she said. Blackmore, further angrily denied a suggestion by Thomas that her claim that Dr Bin Afzal had appeared in her garden was an invention.        
	She said: Why would I take five months off work because I had just invented something? Do you think I have got nothing better in my life to do than to invent a situation where a doctor uses my information to turn up on my doorstep... would I really want that when I have got a delicious loving family and love what I do everyday, what would inspire me to invent a situation like that?        
	Dr Bin Afzal qualified in 2000 from the University of Karachi.                    THE DAILY TELEGRAPH

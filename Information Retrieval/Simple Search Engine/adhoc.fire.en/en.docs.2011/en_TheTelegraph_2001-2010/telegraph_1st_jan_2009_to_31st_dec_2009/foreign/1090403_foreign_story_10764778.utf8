                                                                                                               Hasina to Khaleda: return house
                              Hasina: Not fair                            
	Dhaka, April 2 (PTI): Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina has asked Opposition leader Khaleda Zia of the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) to return her house in the Dhaka cantonment area to the state.        
	The Prime Minister said Zia had violated rules during the allotment of the house.         
	Speaking at the parliament yesterday, Hasina said her government would take a decision on the house, which was given to Zia in 1981 after the assassination of her husband  former President Zia-ur Rahman.        
	Taking possession of a house illegally by a former Premier, who is now the leader of the Opposition, is not fair, Hasina said.        
	She (Zia) should return the house to the state. Why should she force us to take the possession of the house? she said replying to a question raised by a ruling Awami League lawmaker.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Bullock, porn star in girl row

	New York, Oct. 26: Hollywood actress Sandra Bullock is embroiled in a child custody battle with her husbands ex-wife, a pornography star and convicted fraudster.        
	The 45-year-old star of Speed and Miss Congeniality is married to Jesse James, a former motorcycle mechanic and television presenter. Since January this year, they have been bringing up Sunny, Jamess five-year-old daughter, while the girls mother, Janine Lindemulder, was serving a six-month sentence for tax evasion.        
	Lindemulder, the star of dozens of adult films including Where The Boys Arent 10 and Janines Got Male, had previously shared custody of the child with James. Supported by Bullock, he has now asked a judge in Orange county, near Los Angeles, to rule on whether Lindemulder is a fit mother. In a statement to court, James suggested Sunny may not be safe with his ex-wife, adding that she should be restrained from allowing the child around pornographers, drug addicts, guns and firearms, felons and other unsafe environments.        
	The judge has yet to rule whether either of the parents or Bullock will have to give evidence in court. Bullock has never had children of her own, citing with regret a mother who urged her to put her career first.

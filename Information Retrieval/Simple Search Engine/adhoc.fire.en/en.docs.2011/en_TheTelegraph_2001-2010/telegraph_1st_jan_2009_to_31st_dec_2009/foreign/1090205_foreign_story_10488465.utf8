The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Obama: I screwed up, absolutely
                                                                                                               Obama: I screwed up, absolutely
                              Obama at the school in Washington. (Reuters)                            
	Washington, Feb. 4: President Obama acknowledged yesterday that he screwed up in trying to exempt some candidates for positions in his administration from strict ethics standards and accepted the withdrawal of two top nominees, including former Senate majority leader Thomas A. Daschle, in the first major setback of his young presidency.        
	Obama officials had sought a seamless transition, nominating most of his cabinet at record pace and taking office ready to implement a raft of new policies. His reversal yesterday suggested that speed may have come at a cost, and that Obama, despite the overwhelming popularity he had upon taking office and the major challenges facing the nation, will not be spared from the same kind of scrutiny his predecessors have faced.        
	In jettisoning one of his closest and earliest political allies, the President appeared eager to make a course correction after days of criticism that his administration was not abiding by its own stated ethical standards and questions about his ability to bring change to the capital.        
	Did I screw up in this situation? Absolutely. Im willing to take my lumps, Obama told NBCs Brian Williams, one of five interviews he gave yesterday afternoon. Obama told the network anchors that there are not two sets of rules for people, and said that average taxpayers deserve to have public officials who pay their taxes on time.        
	Ive got to own up to my mistake, which is that ultimately its important for this administration to send a message that there arent two sets of rules, Obama said in an interview with NBC News. You know, one for prominent people and one for ordinary folks who have to pay their taxes.        
	Daschle, a closer confidant to Obama than any other cabinet nominee, had offered to step down over the weekend, but officials close to both men said Obama had urged him to fight for confirmation.         
	In evening interviews on broadcast and cable television networks, Obama said he took responsibility for the errors. And so Im frustrated with myself, with our team, he told NBC, but ultimately my job is to get this thing back on track because what we need to focus on is a deteriorating economy and getting people back to work. He added: Im here on television saying I screwed up and thats part of the era of responsibility.         
	The nominees tax problems also gave Republicans a new argument against Obama and his party as the economic debate proceeds: that Democrats are cavalier about taxing other people because they do not abide by the tax laws themselves. It was the rockiest day yet for the new White House.         
	Two hours before Daschle withdrew, Obamas nominee to be the chief White House performance officer, Nancy Killefer, pulled her name from consideration because of unpaid payroll taxes for a household employee.         
	And perhaps most significant, the move threatened Obamas plans to overhaul the health-care system, a central policy initiative and one so important that he had chosen Daschle for a perch both at the department of health and human services and in the White House itself.         
	Hours before delivering the same mea culpa to each of the five television anchors at the Oval Office, Obama and his wife Michelle made an unscheduled stop at a public school not far away.         
	We were just tired of being in the White House, Obama told second graders at the Capital city Public Charter school.

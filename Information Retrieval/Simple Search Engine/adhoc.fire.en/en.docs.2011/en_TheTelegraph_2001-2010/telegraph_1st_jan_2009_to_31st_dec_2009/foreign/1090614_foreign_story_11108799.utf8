	Faithful Kylie    
	 London, June 13 (PTI): Popstar Kylie Minogue is reportedly converting to the Roman Catholic religion so that she can marry her Spanish boyfriend Andres Valencoso in a traditional church wedding.       
	She enjoyed the sense of community Andress family share thanks to their faith. Kylie is so intent on including the traditional aspects of a Catholic mass that she is thinking of converting, a source close to the singer told Britains Grazia magazine. The 41-year-old singer has been dating Valencoso since last November.     
	Lee honour    
	 London (Reuters): Dracula actor Christopher Lee and golfer Nick Faldo will receive knighthoods in the Queens birthday honours list  and a 93-year-old station master gets a nod too. The Queens twice-yearly list recognises achievements in all walks of life, from the rich and famous to community workers. There are 984 nominations in all, more than 70 per cent of whom are local heroes.    
	Fox wife    
	 Los Angeles (PTI): Hollywood beauty Megan Fox believes that she is incapable of being a good wife which is why she broke off her engagement to actor Brian Austin Green. Brian and I are not engaged, because when youre engaged, your goal is marriage. I dont think thats a realistic goal for me right now, Fox told Entertainment Weekly magazine. The 23-year-old Transformers star, who was linked to her co-star Shia Labeouf after her annulled engagement, said that she is still dating her ex-fiance but is not ready to marry him.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Pak backlash on Taliban
                                                                                                               Pak backlash on Taliban
                            
	Islamabad, June 8 (AP): Hundreds of Pakistani tribesmen furious over a deadly suicide bombing at a mosque laid siege to several Taliban strongholds in the troubled northwestern region, killing at least 11 militants, officials said today.        
	The weekend clashes appeared to be the latest evidence of growing anti-Taliban sentiment in Pakistan, a shift that comes as suicide attacks have surged and the military wages an offensive in the nearby Swat Valley.        
	The attack on the mosque left 33 worshippers dead and wounded dozens more during Friday prayers, angering residents of the Haya Gai area of Upper Dir district.        
	Some 400 villagers banded together to attack five villages in nearby Dhok Darra that were known militant strongholds, said Atif-ur-Rehman, the district coordination officer.        
	The citizens militia has occupied three of the villages since yesterday and was trying to push the Taliban out of the other two today. Some 20 houses suspected of harbouring Taliban militants were destroyed, he said.        
	District police chief Ejaz Ahmad said 200 militants were putting up a fight but were surrounded by the villagers.        
	The government has encouraged local citizens to set up militias to oust Taliban fighters, especially in the regions that border Afghanistan where al Qaida and the Taliban have hide-outs.         
	Already, military officials say that as theyve proceeded with the operation in Swat, local residents who have remained in the region have grown increasingly cooperative, providing tips on militants hide-outs and more.        
	It is something very positive that tribesmen are standing against the militants. It will discourage the miscreants, Rehman said. Police chief Ahmad added: We will send security forces, maybe artillery too, if the villagers ask for a reinforcement.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | China disables some Google functions
                                                                                                               China disables some Google functions
          EDWARD WONG                          Criticised for erotic content                                  
	Beijing, June 20: The Chinese government disabled some search functions on the Chinese-language website of Google yesterday, saying the site was linking too often to pornographic and vulgar content.        
	Government officials met managers of the Chinese operations of Google on Thursday afternoon to warn them that the company would be punished if it did not remove the offending material from the website, according to a report yesterday by Xinhua, the state news agency.        
	Earlier Thursday, a government-supported Internet watchdog group, the China Internet Illegal Information Reporting Center, criticised the search engine for its erotic content and threatened punishment by the government. It said Google had already been warned twice, in January and April, about its content.        
	Last evening, the associative-word feature of the website appeared to have been disabled. That is the function that displays a drop-down menu of words related to a search word that is typed into the search engine. The previous evening, reporters on China Central Television, the state television network, showed how typing in the Chinese word for son, erzi, could pull up associated terms that have lewd connotations.         
	State news organisations said the ability to use Googles Chinese site to search overseas websites was supposed to have been disabled, but that feature was working last evening. Google released a statement saying it was making greater efforts to clean up its Chinese website. We have been continually working to deal with pornographic content, and material that is harmful to children, on the web in China, the statement said.        
	Recent efforts by the Chinese government to limit access to the Internet have outraged Chinese computer users. The strongest reaction has been to the governments plan to force computer makers to install Internet censorship software on all computers sold in China after July 1.         
	Critics say the software, called Green Dam-Youth Escort, could be used to censor websites with content deemed politically unacceptable, even though the government says its main use will be to block access to pornography.        
	Computer experts say the software can make a computer vulnerable to hackers. This week, developers said they had found solutions to the problems. But yesterday, J. Alex Halderman, a computer science professor at the University of Michigan, said that a patched version of Green Dam had a security problem as serious as the original one.

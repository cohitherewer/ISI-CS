The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | In drivers seat, she is a bit slow 
                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      In drivers seat, she is a bit slow 
                            
	London, Dec. 20: Women are slower and less accurate at parking than men, according to a scientific study that confirms the suspicions of many male motorists.        
	Female drivers take an average of 20 seconds longer to park their cars but are still less likely to end up in the middle of the bay, the research suggests. As part of the test 65 people were asked to park an Audi A6 family saloon in a standard-sized parking space.         
	Their manoeuvres  including head-on, reverse and parallel parking  were timed and rated for accuracy, which was judged by how far they kept the vehicle from the edges of the bay.        
	While the researchers expected the women volunteers to be slower, they were surprised to find that the cautious approach did not lead to a tidier final result.        
	Claudia Wolf from Ruhr University in Bochum, Germany, who led the study, said that the research confirmed previous findings that men have better co-ordination and spatial awareness than women, and take more risks behind the wheel.        
	These prejudices exist and as a scientist I decided to find out if they are true or based on myth, she told the Mail on Sunday.        
	I dont think that feminism or the cause of women is in any way set back by these findings. It only proves what previous studies about the spatial differences between men and women have shown.        
	Besides, it is not as if there was a massive failing by women. It is just about parking  not the triumph of men over women.

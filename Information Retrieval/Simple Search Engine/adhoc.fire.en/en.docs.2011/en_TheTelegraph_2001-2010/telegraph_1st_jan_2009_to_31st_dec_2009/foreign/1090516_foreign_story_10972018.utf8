The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Bangla arrest 
                                                                                                               Bangla arrest 
                            
	Dhaka, May 15 (Reuters): Bangladesh security forces arrested today an outlawed Islamist groups explosives expert and his wife, who set off a bomb in an effort to protect her husband during the raid on their home, a senior security official said.        
	Jahidur Rahman, alias Boma Mizan, is a senior member of Jamaat-ul-Mujahideen Bangladesh (JMB), Rezanur Rahman Khan, assistant director general of the Rapid Action Battalion elite force, told reporters. Jahidur was captured unhurt in the early morning Dhaka raid, but his wife Sharmin was injured in the blast. The RAB recovered one pistol, two bombs, two grenades, several rounds of ammunition and bomb-making materials from their house.        
	The bomb blew much of Sharmins right hand off and hurt their two children. Security forces carried out a second raid on what they said was another JMB den in the city, used to make bombs, train militants and store explosives.        
	We have found a huge quantity of bomb-making ingredients and other materials including detonator, grenade casing, fuse, plastic explosives and chemicals in the camp in the citys Mirpur residential area, RAB Chief Hassan Mahmood Khandker told reporters. Equipment and chemicals for making mines were also found. This is the first time we have found mine-making materials from a militants den, said another RAB official. JMB, one of several outlawed Islamist groups trying to turn Bangladesh into a Islamic state, was blamed for 2005 bombings.

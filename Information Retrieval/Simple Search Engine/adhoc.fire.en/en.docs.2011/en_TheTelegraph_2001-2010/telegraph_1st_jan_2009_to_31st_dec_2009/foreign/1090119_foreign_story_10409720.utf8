The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Hamas announces ceasefire 
                                                                                                               Hamas announces ceasefire 
                            
	Gaza, Jan. 18 (Reuters): Hamas today announced an immediate ceasefire along with other militant groups in the Gaza Strip and gave Israel, which has already declared a unilateral truce, a week to pull its troops out of the territory.        
	A spokesperson for Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert said in response: Well play this day by day. Well see how this goes. We want to leave Gaza. Well do so as soon as we can.        
	Ayman Taha, a Hamas official in Cairo for talks with Egypt on the conflict, said the group and other factions were announcing a Gaza ceasefire starting immediately and Israel, which launched its offensive on December 27, had a week to withdraw.        
	Hamas, he said, was demanding the opening of all Gaza border crossings for the entry of all materials, food, goods and basic needs.        
	At least three rockets struck southern Israel after Hamas said it was halting attacks, police said.        
	A statement issued by Hamas in Syria, which also announced the week-long ceasefire, said Palestinian factions were willing to respond to efforts by Egypt and others to broker an agreement for the final lifting of Israels blockade of the Gaza Strip.

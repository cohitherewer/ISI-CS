The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | AIG honchos urged to return half of bonuses
                                                                                                               AIG honchos urged to return half of bonuses
          DAVID STOUT AND LOUISE STORY                          AIG CEO Edward Liddy at Capitol Hill. (AP)                                  
	Washington, March 18: Edward M. Liddy, the embattled chief of American International Group, is expected to ask employees who received lucrative bonuses to give half the money back.        
	According to a person briefed on Liddys plans, the AIG chief will announce his plan during testimony this afternoon before a Congressional committee that is investigating the problems at company.        
	Given the public outcry over the $165 million in bonuses paid out last week, it is unclear whether Liddys compromise will appease lawmakers, who have threatened to develop new tax rules or file lawsuits to get the money back. AIG has received nearly $200 billion in federal bailout funds.        
	The bonuses were paid to 418 AIG employees last week as part of a retention plan, but 52 of those workers have already left the company, according to New Yorks attorney general, Andrew M. Cuomo.        
	Liddys plan to request half of the bonus money back was not included in his prepared testimony released to the public in advance of the hearing. Such an action would be highly unusual for a financial company.         
	A spokesman for AIG declined to comment.        
	The bonus figures were lofty. The highest one was $6.4 million, and 6 other employees received more than $4 million, according to Cuomo, the New York attorney general.        
	Fifteen other people received bonuses of more than $2 million and 51 received $1 million to $2 million.         
	The total paid out to the 52 workers who already left was $33.6 million, according to Cuomo. It is unclear if Liddys plan would apply to those 52 workers.        
	 Cuomos office is negotiating with AIG to obtain the names of the workers who received the bonuses.         
	The development came as a wave of Congressional condemnation greeted Liddy today over the bonuses paid to company executives, with some lawmakers vowing to do something to get the money back.        
	We are the effective owners of this company, said Representative Barney Frank of Massachusetts, the chairman of the House Financial Services Committee, going on to suggest a lawsuit to recover the $165 million in bonuses. I think its worth trying.        
	It was clear that lawmakers were in no mood to hear AIGs chief, say, as he did in his prepared text, that, while the bonuses were distasteful, they were the result of the companys legal obligation to honour its employment contracts.        
	By we, Frank made clear, he meant the American taxpayers, whose collective anger has been felt on Capitol Hill over the last several days.         
	The lawmakers, having heard from their furious constituents, seemed unwilling to be mollified by the pledge from Liddy, who took the helm at AIG last autumn after it had begun imploding because of reckless investments, that the companys 116,000 employees were united in wanting to work out of the morass, and work shoulder to shoulder with federal regulators.

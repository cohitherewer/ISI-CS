	Islamabad, April 27 (Reuters): Pakistans President Asif Ali Zardari today said that the whereabouts of al Qaida leader Osama bin Laden remained a mystery and there was a suspicion that he could be dead.        
	Speaking to reporters, Zardari said US officials had told him that they had no trace of the al Qaida chief. The President said Pakistans own intelligence agencies were no wiser, either. There is no news, Zardari said. They obviously feel that he does not exist anymore but thats not confirmed.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Kuwait fire kills 41
                                                                                                               Kuwait fire kills 41
                            
	Kuwait City, Aug. 16 (AP): A fire that tore through a wedding tent outside Kuwaits capital killed 41 women and children in just three minutes, leaving behind shoes melted to the ground and bodies so blackened they were unrecognisable, the fire chief said today.        
	Guests probably crushed one another in a desperate attempt to flee through the only exit, Jassem al-Mansouri said.        
	The fire, the worst in the country in four decades, was likely to result in restrictions on the tradition of holding celebrations in such tents.        
	Causes of the fire include faulty electrical wiring, a problem with the equipment used to warm the food buffet, al-Mansouri said.

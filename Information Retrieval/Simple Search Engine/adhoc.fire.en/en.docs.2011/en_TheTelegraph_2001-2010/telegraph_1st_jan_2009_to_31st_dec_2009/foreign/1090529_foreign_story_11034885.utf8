The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Peshawar hit by blasts as Taliban vow more attacks
                                                                                                               Peshawar hit by blasts as Taliban vow more attacks
                            
	Islamabad, May 28: Taliban groups claimed responsibility today for the bombing that killed at least 26 people and injured several hundred in Lahore a day earlier, and issued an extraordinary warning for people to evacuate Pakistani cities, saying they were preparing major attacks.         
	Hours after the threat, as many as three blasts, including two at crowded bazaars, rocked the northwestern city of Peshawar, killing at least five people and wounding dozens.         
	In telephone calls to Reuters, a Pakistani insurgent commander, Hakimullah Mehsud, who is known to be aligned with the Pakistani Taliban leader Baitullah Mehsud, said that the attack in Lahore and the others threatened by the Taliban were a reaction to the Pakistani Armys campaign against the Taliban in the northwestern Swat Valley.         
	We want the people of Lahore, Rawalpindi, Islamabad and Multan to leave those cities, as we plan major attacks against government facilities in coming days and weeks, he said.

	Binghamton (New York), April 4 (Agencies): The Pakistani Taliban today sought to claim responsibility for the shooting rampage in a New York state town but the FBI firmly discounted the militant claim and officials said the gunman was angry over losing his job as well about his poor English skills.        
	Pakistani Taliban militant leader Baitullah Mehsud said the Binghamton shooting in which at least 13 people were killed was revenge for US drone attacks in Pakistan.        
	I accept responsibility. They were my men. I gave them orders in reaction to US drone attacks, Mehsud told Reuters by phone.        
	Pakistani security analysts dismissed it as a publicity stunt. The FBI, too, dismissed the Taliban claim. Based on the evidence, we can firmly discount that claim, FBI spokesperson Richard Kolko said in Washington.        
	Over the past few years, Mehsud has risen from obscurity to become Pakistans most notorious militant commander, blamed for the 2007 assassination of former Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto and Mondays attack on the police academy near Lahore. Binghamton police chief Joseph Zikuski said people degraded and disrespected the gunman over his poor English.        
	Mayor Matthew Ryan said the man, believed to be 42-year-old Vietnamese immigrant Jiverly Voong, was angry about his language issues and his lack of employment. He had lost a job recently and was somewhat angry, Ryan told ABC. He had language issues, didnt speak English that well, and was really concerned about his employment situation.        
	Yesterday, he barricaded the American Civic Association community centres back door with his car, walked in the front and started shooting with two handguns. Within minutes, a receptionist, 12 immigrants taking a citizenship class and the gunman were dead.Another receptionist, who played dead after she was shot in the abdomen, called the emergency despatcher to get police to the scene within two minutes.        
	Zikuski said the injured receptionist stayed on the phone for 90 minutes, feeding us information constantly, despite a serious wound in the abdomen. Shes a hero in her own right, he said.        
	 Four people were critically wounded in the massacre, and 37 others made it out, including 26 who hid for hours in a basement boiler room while police tried to determine whether the gunman was still alive and whether he was holding any hostages, Zikuski said.

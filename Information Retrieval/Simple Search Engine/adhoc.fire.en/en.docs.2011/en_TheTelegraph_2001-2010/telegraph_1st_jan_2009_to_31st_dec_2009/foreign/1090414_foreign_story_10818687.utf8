	Islamabad, April 13 (AP): Pakistani lawmakers passed a resolution today urging the President to sign a regulation that imposes Islamic rule in a northwestern valley in exchange for peace with the Taliban.        
	Hours after a Taliban spokesman said lawmakers would be considered to have abandoned Islam if they opposed the Islamic law deal, the National Assembly unanimously approved the resolution aimed at President Asif Ali Zardari. However, one party boycotted the resolution.        
	The provincial government in northwestern Pakistan agreed in February to impose Islamic law in the Swat Valley and surrounding areas in exchange for a ceasefire with the Taliban. Western and Pakistani critics say the agreement represents a dangerous surrender to extremists behind a campaign of terrorism in the Swat Valley and more broadly across the border region with Afghanistan. Amid the criticism, Zardari has delayed signing the agreement.        
	His stance has long been that he wont sign until peace is achieved in the area  but he has not defined what that means. The delay led a hardline cleric mediating the agreement to leave Swat in anger last week while also upsetting lawmakers from the region. Over the weekend, the federal government said Zardari wanted opinions from National Assembly MPs first. The whole nation is united in its support of the Swat regulation and wants the president to approve it, Prime Minister Yousuf Raza Gilani said at the start of a floor debate on the pact today.

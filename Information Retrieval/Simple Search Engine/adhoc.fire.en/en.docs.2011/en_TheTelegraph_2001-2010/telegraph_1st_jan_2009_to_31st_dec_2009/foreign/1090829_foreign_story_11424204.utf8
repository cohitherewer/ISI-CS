The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Teetotallers suffer more anxiety than drinkers
                                                                                                               Teetotallers suffer more anxiety than drinkers
                            
	London, Aug. 28: Teetotallers suffer higher levels of depression than drinkers, claims new research.        
	 Those who abstain from alcohol are also more likely to lack social skills and have higher levels of anxiety. Non-drinkers even have more mental health issues than those considered heavy drinkers, the survey found.        
	Scientists found that the happiest people were drinkers who averaged two glasses of wine, a bottle of beer, or a shot of spirits a week.One reason why non-drinkers were more gloomy could be that they have few friends.         
	We see that this group is less socially well-adjusted than other groups, said research leader Eystein Stordal, from the Norwegian University of Science. The scientists questioned almost 40,000 Norwegians about their physical and mental health and typical alcohol consumption over a two-week period.

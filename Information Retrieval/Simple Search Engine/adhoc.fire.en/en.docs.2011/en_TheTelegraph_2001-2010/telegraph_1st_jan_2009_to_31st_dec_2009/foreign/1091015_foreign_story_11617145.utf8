	Incognito Kylie    
	 London, Oct. 14 (PTI): Pop star Kylie Minogue loves living in America because she can move freely in public without attracting attention.       
	Minogue, who wrapped up her first ever US tour yesterday, claims that she can walk around in the US incognito and not get hassled by fans, repors the Daily Express. I can keep a much lower profile, which is enjoyable. And then if someones looking at me, Im like: Why are they staring at me? Whats wrong?, Minogue said.

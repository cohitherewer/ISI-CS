The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Iran moved billions via US banks
                                                                                                               Iran moved billions via US banks
          VIKAS BAJAJ AND JOHN ELIGON                              
	London, Jan. 10: Iranian banks illegally shifted billions of dollars through American financial institutions in recent years, and authorities suspect some of the money may have been used to finance Irans nuclear and missile programmes.        
	Details of the illicit transfers came to light yesterday when New York state and federal authorities announced that a large British bank had agreed to pay $350 million to settle accusations that it had helped the Iranian banks hide the transactions.        
	The British bank, the Lloyds TSB Group, stripped information that would have identified the transfers in order to deceive American financial institutions, which are barred from doing business with Iranian banks, Robert M. Morgenthau, the Manhattan district attorney, said. Lloyds acknowledged its conduct and agreed to turn over detailed records of the transactions.         
	They went to great lengths to obliterate any identification, Morgenthau said.         
	The district attorneys office was still investigating nine major banks that might be engaging in similar conduct, but prosecutors declined to name them.         
	Morgenthau said, however, that money in one transaction was used to buy a large amount of tungsten, an ingredient for making long-range missiles.         
	In the current case, investigators were unsure what the money was used for, said Daniel J. Castleman, the chief assistant district attorney.         
	The stripping made it impossible to determine where the money was going, he said.         
	We dont know of any money that has gone to any terrorist organisations, individuals or anything like that, he said.

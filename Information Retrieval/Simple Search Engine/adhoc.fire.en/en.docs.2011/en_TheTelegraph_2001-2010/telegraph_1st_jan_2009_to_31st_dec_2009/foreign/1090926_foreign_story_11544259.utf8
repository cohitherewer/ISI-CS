The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Iran reveals second nuke plant
                                                                                                               Iran reveals second nuke plant
          MICHAEL D. SHEAR AND DEBBI WILGOREN                          Ahmedinejad at the UN. (AP)                                  
	Pittsburgh, Sept. 25: President Obama and the leaders of France and Britain blasted Irans construction of a previously unacknowledged uranium enrichment facility and demanded today that Tehran immediately fulfil its obligations under international law or risk the imposition of harsh new sanctions.        
	Iran is breaking rules that all nations must follow, Obama said, detailing how the facility near Qom had been under construction for years without being disclosed, as required, to the International Atomic Energy Agency. International law is not an empty promise.        
	The new Iranian plant, the countrys second uranium enrichment facility, is believed by US officials to be part of a broad effort by Irans leaders to pursue the ability to build nuclear weapons. Iran has repeatedly denied having any such goal, insisting that its nuclear programme is aimed at generating electricity.                   
	US officials said they believe the Qom plant is not yet operational but is intended to produce highly enriched uranium  suitable for nuclear weapons  and will be capable within months of producing enough material for at least one bomb per year. In an early indication of Irans reaction, President Mahmoud Ahmedinejad warned western officials against pressing their case about the new enrichment plan during the upcoming talks.        
	If I were [President] Obamas adviser, I would definitely advise him to refrain making this statement because it is definitely a mistake, Ahmedinejad told Time magazine today in an interview in New York that took place even as Obama was publicly revealing the plants existence. It would definitively be a mistake. Ahmadinejad dismissed the accusations from Obama and the other leaders.        
	This does not mean we must inform Obamas administration of every facility that we have, he told Time. It simply adds to the list of issues [over] which the United States owes the Iranian nation an apology.... Rest assured that this will be the case. We do everything transparently.        
	Iran acknowledged the existence of the facility for the first time on Monday, in a letter to the Vienna-based International Atomic Energy Agency. The letter said a new pilot fuel enrichment plant is under construction in the country, said Marc Vidricaire, a spokesman for the watchdog agency.         
	The letter stated that the enrichment level would be up to 5 per cent. That level is far below the enrichment level needed for nuclear weapons.

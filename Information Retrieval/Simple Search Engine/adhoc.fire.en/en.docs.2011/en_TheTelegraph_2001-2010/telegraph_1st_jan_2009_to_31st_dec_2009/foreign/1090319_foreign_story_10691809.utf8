The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Kayani shows army its future role in Pak
                                                                                                               Kayani shows army its future role in Pak
                              Kayani: In the background                            
	Islamabad, March 18 (Reuters): Pakistans army chief played a crucial role behind the scenes in resolving a political crisis this week, pointing to how a military with a record of seizing power could use its influence in future, analysts said.        
	The year-old civilian government led by President Asif Ali Zardari agreed on Monday to restore Pakistans top judge sacked in 2007, ending a confrontation between the countrys two biggest political parties that had looked set to spark street violence.        
	Army chief General Ashfaq Kayani, who has often stressed he wants to keep the military out of politics, met the President and the Prime Minister several times during intense negotiations to work out a solution.        
	The military has ruled Pakistan for more than half of its 61 years of independence and has kept a dominant role in political affairs even when not officially holding the reins of power.        
	But Pakistani media, traditionally hostile to military involvement in politics, hailed Kayanis part in defusing the crisis, which analysts said highlighted a more low-key role the military can play.        
	It has reaffirmed (the) militarys vital role in Pakistans political process and has shown it has the capacity to play a political role even from the sidelines, said political and security analyst Hasan Askari Rizvi.        
	 Security analyst Ikram Sehgal said the army was reverting to the sort of role it played through most of the 1990s, when it declined to take power but exerted its influence discreetly during periods of political turmoil.         
	The army wants desperately to keep out of the situation. They realise they do not have the capabilities to run a government, Sehgal said.         
	One will definitely see the army playing a role behind the scenes ... If they stepped back in it would probably be on a Bangladesh model: set up a technocratic government and run the people who run the government, he said.

	Beauty at 32    
	 London, Jan. 28: Women feel most beautiful aged 32, a survey has reportedly found. Almost 40 per cent women said they were at their most attractive at the age, reports The Daily Telegraph.       
	Many reportedly explained that at 32 their life had the mix of confidence gained from life experience, an active love life and the pleasure of eating and drinking sensibly.       
	Dr Sandra Wheatley, a psychologist, told the Daily Mail that the surveys findings were really encouraging and indicated that women placed value on life achievements as well as youthful looks. The survey of 1,500 women was carried out via the Internet by a mineral water company.    
	Ice fest    
	 Toronto (Reuters): A cruise ship carrying nearly 400 people has been stuck in thick ice in the St. Lawrence river in Eastern Canada for over a day, but passengers are nonetheless having a festive time, the company that owns the vessel said yesterday. The ship, CTMA-Vacancier, chartered by a group travelling from Montreal to the Gaspe Peninsula for a cross-country skiing trip, is now inching through the heavy ice. The 300 passengers, along with a crew of nearly 100, were in no danger and there was plenty of food on board.

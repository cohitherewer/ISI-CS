The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Star of Angels dies of cancer
                                                                                                               Star of Angels dies of cancer
          SUSAN STEWART                          Farrah Fawcett as Jill Munroe in the US television series Charlies Angels                                   
	New York, June 25: Farrah Fawcett, an actress and television star whose good looks and signature flowing hairstyle influenced a generation of women and, beginning with a celebrated pin-up poster, bewitched a generation of men, died this morning in Santa Monica, California. She was 62.         
	Her death, at a Santa Monica hospital, was announced by her spokesman, Paul Bloch.         
	Fawcett had been battling intestinal cancer since late 2006, and to an extraordinary degree that fight was played out in public, generating enormous interest worldwide. Her face, often showing the ravages of cancer, became a tabloid fixture, and updates on her health became staples of television entertainment news.         
	 Fawcetts career was a patchwork of positives and negatives, fine dramatic performances on television and on stage as well as missed opportunities.         
	She first became famous when a poster of her in a red bathing suit, leonine mane flying, sold more than twice as many copies as posters of Marilyn Monroe and Betty Grable combined.         
	Fawcett won praise for her serious acting later in her career, typically as a victimised woman. But she remained best known for the hit 1970s television show Charlies Angels, in which she played Jill Munroe, one of three beautiful female private detectives employed by an unseen male boss. Her pin-up fame had led the producers to cast her. Fawcett and her fellow angels, played by Jaclyn Smith and Kate Jackson, brought evildoers to justice, often while posing in decoy roles that put them in skimpy outfits or provocative situations.        
	Charlies Angels, created and produced by Aaron Spelling and Leonard Goldberg for ABC, was a phenomenon, finishing the 1976-77 season as the No. 5 network show, the highest-rated television debut in history at that time.         
	In 1978 Playboy magazine called Fawcett the first mass visual symbol of post-neurotic fresh-air sexuality. She herself put it more succinctly: When the show got to be No. 3, I figured it was our acting. When it got to be No. 1, I decided it could only be because none of us wears a bra.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Wall Street pay cycle changes

	New York, Feb. 5: To most people, a salary cap of $500,000 would be anything but punishment.         
	But in Wall Streets executive suites, it amounts to a humbling pay cut  and, just maybe, the beginning of a cultural shift. True, the rich always seem to find new ways to get richer. But in the sweep of history, high pay on Wall Street comes and goes through cycles of excess and correction. After an age of astonishing wealth, the cycle, seems to be turning once again.         
	The Obama administrations curb on executive pay, announced yesterday, is a limited step. But government actions tend to work best when they are in step with market forces and public opinion. Wall Streets wayward bonus system, analysts note, is now widely criticised, even in banking circles, for contributing to the economys woes. Understandably, pay is a touchy subject for financial executives these days, with reports last week that total bonus payments at New York financial companies last year reached $18.4 billion.        
	But with tighter regulations on risk-taking and greater public scrutiny, the pay for top bankers could fall into line with pay for other professions, like doctors and lawyers. Indeed, high pay on Wall Street is an episodic phenomenon.         
	A recent paper by two economists studied pay in finance from 1909 to 2006, comparing the industrys pay levels with the private sector as a whole, seeking to adjust for education, skills, age and gender of the workers.        
	In their National Bureau of Economic Research working paper, Thomas Philippon of New York University and Ariell Reshef of the University of Virginia found that the difference in pay between finance and the rest of industry was slight, if any, except in the late 1920s to 1930 and then again from the mid-1990s to 2006. In those boom years, compensation in finance was 30 percent to 50 percent higher than in the rest of industry.

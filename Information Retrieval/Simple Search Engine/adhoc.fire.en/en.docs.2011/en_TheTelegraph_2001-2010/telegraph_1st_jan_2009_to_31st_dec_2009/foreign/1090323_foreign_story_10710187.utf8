The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Princess from wrong side
                                                                                                               Princess from wrong side
          AMIT ROY                          Jade Goody: Life and death on reality TV                                  
	London, March 22: In the end, Shilpa Shetty, who claimed she had filming commitments,could not pay a farewell visit to Jade Goody, her former would-be nemesis on Celebrity Big Brother who died in her sleep at 3.14am today.        
	Her passing was announced by Max Clifford, the publicist who has been acting on her behalf since April last year when Jade appealed to him to help save her shattered television career.        
	She was a very, very brave girl, said Clifford.        
	Jades career went into steep decline when she led a pack of Englishwomen against Shilpa on reality television over two years ago. The British, having to confront the reality of racist abuse that many non-whites suffer in their day to day lives, made sure that Shilpa emerged victorious.        
	While an increasingly affluent Shilpa posed for pictures outside the House of Commons, received an honorary degree from Leeds Metropolitan University and an audience from the queen and went on to invest in the IPL with her boyfriend, Raj Kundra, Jade saw the perfume she had endorsed removed from supermarket shelves and her publishers decide to not issue her autobiography in paperback.        
	As her career lay in ruins, Jade went to India to offer a personal apology and made it up with Shilpa. When Jade disclosed she hadcancer, the cynical initially wondered whether this was yet another publicity stunt. But with passing months, nothing became Jade so much as the manner in which she chose to die.        
	Shilpa said today: I am deeply saddened by the news but in hindsight glad she is out of pain and passed away peacefully in her sleep. Words cannot express how I feel.        
	The emotional reaction to Jades death from cervical cancer at the age of only 27 is such that comparisons are immediately being made with the grief which gripped Britain in 1997 after Princess Dianas death.        
	The sadness at Jades passing appears to be genuine. For a start, she has left behind two young sons, Bobby, 5, and Freddie, 4  and that, too, on Mothering Sunday.        
	This morning at Jades home in Upshire, Essex, where Jade died, with her mother, Jackiey Budden, and her on-off boyfriend, Jack Tweed, who married her very recently, by her side, bunches of flowers were beingplaced in the spring sunshine.        
	The actor, Stephen Fry, who comes from the top end of society compared with Jades more than modest origins, called her a kind of Princess D from the wrong side of the tracks.        
	The national tributes were led by Gordon Brown, who said he was deeply saddened by Jades death.        
	Unlike Tony Blair, who described Diana as the peoples princess after she was killed in a car crash in a Paris tunnel, Brown could not find words to match but he recognised that Jade had drawn attention to the need for women to have early checks for cervical cancer.        
	She was a courageous woman both in life and death and the whole country has admired her determination to provide a bright future for her children, the Prime Minister said.         
	She will be remembered fondly by all who knew her and her family can be extremely proud of the work she has done to raise awareness of cervical cancer which will benefit thousands of women across the UK.        
	It was while she was appearing on Indian television on Bigg Boss, fronted by Shilpa, that Jade took the telephone call  live on camera confirming she had cancer. By late last year, doctors confirmed there was no hope of saving her.        
	Some doctors believe the stress of dealing with her shattered career and face widespread hostile reaction to her perceived racism may have hastened the spread of her cancer.        
	Harpal Kumar, Cancer Research UKs chief executive, pointed out: Jade is one of 1,000 women to die from cervical cancer each year inthe UK. Her brave battle with an aggressive form of cervical cancer has received widespread public attention and encouraged thousands of women to seek advice on how to prevent the disease. She has done a great public service by raising awareness of the importance of screening.        
	She lived out her death before the media, choosing not to wear a wig to disguise the effects of chemotherapy, and sold several final and really final interviews to newspapers and magazines as well as footage of her wedding and her sons christening. Her death may not stop her close family and friends continuing to exploit Brand Jade, as was the case with Diana.        
	My beautiful daughter is at peace, Jades mother said early today. Family and friends would like privacy at last.        
	This will not happen, of course, not least because Jade made it clear she expected a very public Diana-style funeral with the cortegewinding its way through Bermondsey in south London where she had grown up and giant screens erected outside the Essex church where the service will be conducted.        
	Jade had wanted to be remembered as a girl who lit up mundane life in Britain.        
	Perhaps the truth is that she both lived and died by reality television. She would probably have loved to have had live television cameras record the precise moment of her death  and charged a lot of money for the privilege.        
	Big Brother producer Phil Edgar-Jones summed up Jade: She both appalled and enthralled people in equal measure. You had never seen anything like Jade on a primetime TV show.

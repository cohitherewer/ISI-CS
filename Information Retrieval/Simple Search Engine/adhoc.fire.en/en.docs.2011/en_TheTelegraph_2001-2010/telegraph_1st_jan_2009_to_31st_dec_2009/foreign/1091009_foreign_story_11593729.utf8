The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | German wins literature Nobel
                                                                                                               German wins literature Nobel
                              Mueller                            
	Stockholm, Oct. 8 (Reuters): Romanian-born German writer Herta Mueller, who charted the brutality and oppressiveness of Nicolae Ceausescus dictatorship, was lost for words when she learnt she had won the 2009 Nobel literature prize.        
	The Swedish Academy paid tribute to Mueller who, with the concentration of poetry and the frankness of prose, depicts the landscape of the dispossessed, as it announced the 10 million Swedish krona ($1.4 million) award.        
	She was very, very happy. She said she lost her breath and it felt unreal and she was at a loss for words, the academys permanent secretary, Peter Englund, said.        
	Mueller is known for works such as The Land of Green Plums which she dedicated to Romanian friends killed under Ceausescus communist rule and The Appointment in which a Romanian woman sews notes saying Marry Me into suits of men bound for Italy.        
	There is a real power to the way she writes ... she has an incredible message, Englund said.Part of it is her own background as a victim of persecution in Romania.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Berlusconi denies affair with girl
                                                                                                               Berlusconi denies affair with girl
                            
	Rome, May 6 (Reuters): Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi yesterday denied he had been involved with a 17-year-old girl, in response to comments made by his wife who has asked for a divorce.        
	Its a lie, Berlusconi said in an interview on Italys main television talk show, in reference to the accusation over his relationship with Noemi Letizia, whose 18th birthday party he attended last month.         
	Berlusconis wife Veronica Lario expressed her anger at the Prime Ministers presence at the party in announcing to several newspapers on Sunday that she wanted a divorce.        
	In Italy, people under the age of 18 are known as minorenni and are not considered to be adult, though the age of sexual consent is 14.        
	Would the Prime Minister be so crazy to get into a situation like that, Berlusconi said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Karzai, rival claim victories
                                                                                                               Karzai, rival claim victories
                            
	Kabul, Aug. 21 (Reuters): President Hamid Karzais campaign and chief rival Abdullah Abdullah both said today that they had won Afghanistans election.        
	However, Washingtons chief envoy warned the candidates not to declare victory prematurely.        
	Karzais campaign manager and Abdullah both said preliminary, unofficial results showed they had won enough votes to avoid a potentially destabilising second round of voting in October.         
	Election officials said no confirmed results had been released.         
	Initial results show that the President has got a majority, Karzais campaign manager Deen Mohammad said. We will not get to a second round. We have got a majority.        
	Abdullah, Karzais former foreign minister, dismissed the Karzai camps victory claim and said he was on track to win in the first round after yesterdays vote, which went ahead despite sporadic violence after the Taliban threatened the vote.        
	Im ahead. Initial results from the provinces show that I have more than 50 per cent of the vote, Abdullah said by telephone in Kabul.

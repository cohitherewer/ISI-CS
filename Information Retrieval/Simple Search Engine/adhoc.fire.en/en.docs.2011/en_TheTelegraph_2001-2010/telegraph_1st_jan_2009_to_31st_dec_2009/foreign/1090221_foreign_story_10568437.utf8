	Washington, Feb 20 (Reuters): If this is Thursday, it must be Ottawa for President Barack Obama.        
	He travelled around the US for most of two years to win the White House. Now that he has been living there for a month, he has caught the travel bug again.        
	Last week he campaigned for the $787 billion economic stimulus bill by travelling four days in a row, going to Indiana, Florida, Virginia and Illinois.        
	Then he spent a long holiday weekend in his hometown of Chicago and this week he has visited Denver, Colorado, and Phoenix and Mesa in Arizona.        
	Yesterday he went on his first foreign trip. In the Canadian capital, he talked trade with Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper and drew laughter by thanking those Canadians who came over the border to campaign for me during the election.        
	It was much appreciated. And Im looking forward to coming back to Canada as soon as it warms up, he said.        
	Obama, whose approval rating is more than 60 per cent, is drawing big crowds and reveling in the attention, with the cheering throngs a welcome change from Washington, where the next partisan battle is never far away. It did not take long for Obama to complain about feeling constricted after he won the November 4 election, cut off from regular people by the massive security bubble that surrounds him wherever he goes.        
	He believes theres a lot of benefit to getting out of Washington at least once a week and meeting with and seeing the problems that Americans are dealing with, said White House spokesman Robert Gibbs.        
	White House veterans said travelling around the country allows the President to take his case to the people who elected him and escape Washington, which many Americans consider out of touch with their concerns. The White House can be a very confining place, said Jeff Eller, who worked for former President Bill Clinton. Its always good to get out and literally see other parts of the country, touch people and listen to them.

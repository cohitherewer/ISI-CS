The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Heathrow baggage system fails
                                                                                                               Heathrow baggage system fails

	London, June 29 (PTI): Hundreds of passengers were left stranded at Heathrow Terminal 5 after the baggage system collapsed here today, forcing many to travel with only hand luggage.         
	Airport staff said the problems were caused by the same technical difficulties that plagued the disastrous launch of the 4.3 billion terminal last March as scores of flights were cancelled and thousands of bags went missing.         
	Problems started last night when the electronic barcode system on the luggage conveyor belt could not process the large volume of luggage arriving from international passengers transferring at Heathrow.         
	As the system grounded to a halt, the British Airways had to close all check-in desks at midday. They reopened an hour later but only for fliers travelling with hand luggage.

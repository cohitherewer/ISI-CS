	New Delhi, April 22: India tonight walked the tightrope on Sri Lanka, voicing unhappiness at the killing of innocent Tamils there and asking the LTTE to stop the barbaric attempt to hold civilians hostage.        
	The call came after Prime Minister Manmohan Singh reviewed the Lankan situation with the external affairs minister, the defence minister, the national security adviser and the foreign secretary amid mounting pressure from parties in Tamil Nadu to stop the civil war in the island nation.        
	We are very unhappy at the continued killing of innocent Tamil civilians in Sri Lanka. These killings must stop, foreign minister Pranab Mukherjee told reporters after the hour-long meeting.        
	Mukherjee said the Lankan government had a responsibility to protect its own citizens. At the same time, he said, the LTTE must stop its barbaric attempt to hold civilians hostage.        
	 He stressed there was no military solution to the ongoing humanitarian crisis and all concerned should recognise this fact.        
	 India will work to achieve this goal and will do all it can to ameliorate the humanitarian crisis caused by the conflict. Mukherjee said he was speaking to many of his counterparts around the world to join us in this effort.         
	Earlier in the day, it was reported that Sri Lankan President Mahinda Rajapaksa was sending his brother Basil to India shortly as a special emissary to discuss relief and rehabilitation measures for the Tamil civilians.

	London, Oct. 4 (PTI): Actress Sophia Loren and her co-star Penelope Cruz bonded so strong while shooting their new film Nine that they were inseparable till the end.        
	When it was my last day she came to my dressing room. She was crying and I was crying. This is the first time I have left a film set crying because we got so upset about leaving each other, Cruz said.        
	The Oscar-winning-actress has earlier expressed a desire that she wants to age gracefully like the 75-year-old movie icon. Age holds absolutely no fear for me. There is so much enjoyment ahead. Sophia is 74 and amazing  every time I talk to her, shes full of wonderful stories about old actors, Penelope had said.        
	Cruz also said that she found shooting the movie an extremely rewarding and emotional experience.        
	Nine is about film director Guido Contini who struggles to find harmony in his professional and personal lives. He engages in dramatic relationships with his wife, his mistress, his muse, his agent and his mother. The cast includes Daniel Day-Lewis, Nicole Kidman, Marion Cotillard, Penlope Cruz, Judi Dench, and Sophia Loren.

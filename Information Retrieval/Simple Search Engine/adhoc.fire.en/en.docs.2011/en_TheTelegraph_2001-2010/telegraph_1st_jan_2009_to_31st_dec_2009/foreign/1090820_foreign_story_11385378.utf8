The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Afghans feel Karzai is best

	Bati Kot (Afghanistan), Aug. 19: From the gravel lot where he repairs cars, Babarak Shinwari can see the spot where the suicide bomber killed three of his cousins last year.         
	At his home nearby, where his four children live without electricity, Shinwari prays to God for a President who can bring peace and security. But tomorrow, he plans to vote the same way he did five years ago: for Hamid Karzai.        
	The fact that Karzai remains the favourite to win tomorrows election, despite his governments poor record on security and the economy over nearly eight years in power, says much about the mind-set of Afghans as they prepare to go to the polls.         
	In interviews with more than a dozen residents yesterday near the eastern city of Jalalabad, heavily populated by Karzais fellow Pashtuns, all said they planned to vote for the incumbent, even though many were critical of his performance. That paradox reflects Afghans deep suspicion of anyone promising change.         
	Many Afghans reason that although Karzais government has been disappointing, it could always be worse. We dont have any alternative to Karzai, Shinwari said.         
	Indeed, low expectations may be Karzais greatest ally.         
	During the Taliban, we had dirt roads. There were few vehicles. Women couldnt go outside. There were no televisions, no mobile phones, no hotels, and now we have all those things, said Jalil Jan, 30, who owns two petrol stations near Jalalabad.

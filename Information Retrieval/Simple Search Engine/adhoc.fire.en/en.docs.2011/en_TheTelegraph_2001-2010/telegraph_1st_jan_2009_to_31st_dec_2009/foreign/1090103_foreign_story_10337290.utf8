The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Blow to Tiger backers in Tamil Nadu
                                                                                                               Blow to Tiger backers in Tamil Nadu
          G.C. SHEKHAR                              
	Chennai, Jan. 2: Kilinochchis fall represents a major setback not only to the Tamil Tigers but also to its backers in Tamil Nadu who have been urging India to intervene in order to stop the Sri Lankan forces offensive.        
	Although their demands for ceasefire were aimed ostensibly at saving the displaced Tamil civilians, the main objective was to save the LTTE from losing the war and give them the breathing space to regroup. But Delhi, after some token gestures calibrated with Colombo, preferred to look the other way and Tamil Nadu politicians were left with little room to manoeuvre.        
	Even the ruling DMK cut a sorry figure after threatening last October to have its MPs resign if a ceasefire wasnt enforced within two weeks, only to back down sheepishly. Eventually, the party could only send a shipload of food and clothing to the Lankan Tamils.        
	Last week, chief minister M. Karunanidhi meekly repeated his plea, saying he could only write another tearful petition to Delhi to intervene and stop the suffering of Tamils there.         
	The dependence of his minority government on the Congress for survival also did not help matters.        
	MDMK leader Vaiko accused the Congress-led UPA government of not showing interest. The government has not shown the slightest interest in bringing about a ceasefire.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | 10 shot dead in Alabama killing spree
                                                                                                               10 shot dead in Alabama killing spree
                            
	Montgomery (Alabama), March 12 (Reuters): Authorities struggled yesterday to understand why an Alabama man shot dead 10 people, including his mother and four other relatives, before killing himself after a gunbattle with police.        
	Michael McLendons rampage, the worst in the southern states history, bore the signs of a planned attack but lacked a clear motive, J. Christopher Murphy, director of the Alabama Department of Public Safety, said.         
	The 28-year-old gunman, who lived with his mother, was armed with two military assault rifles, a handgun and a shotgun in the shooting spree, which started at a home in Kinston in southeastern Alabama.

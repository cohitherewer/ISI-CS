	Snoopy top dog    
	 New York, Dec. 23 (Reuters): The Peanuts comic strip character Snoopy was named the top dog in pop culture by the American Kennel Club yesterday as part of its 125th anniversary celebration, beating out a college sports mascot.      
	Nearly 76,000 online voters chose their favourites from a list of pop culture dogs drawn from television, film, literature, sports and art, the kennel club said.      
	Snoopy was the pensive dog whose best friend was a bird and who seemed to be smarter than his human master in the comic strip created by the late Charles Schulz.

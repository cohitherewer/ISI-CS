The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Cup of tea can reduce stress: Study
                                                                                                               Cup of tea can reduce stress: Study
          RICHARD ALLEYNE                          Wonder brew                                  
	London, Aug. 13: Putting the kettle on at times of crisis really can help claim scientists who found that tea-making reduces stress levels by up to a quarter.        
	The study, by psychologist Dr Malcolm Cross at City University, London, confirms what millions of tea-lovers have long believed  that if you are upset or anxious, it pays to make a brew.        
	The findings reveal that even a single cup of tea can significantly reduce anxiety levels after suffering a stressful experience  and in some cases, make people calmer than they were before.        
	The experiment at the centre of the study, which placed volunteers in a stressful scenario, showed a 25 per cent increase in anxiety for those that did not receive tea immediately after the stress-inducing test. Conversely, those who were given tea actually demonstrated a four per cent reduction in stress. The psychologist found that the act of putting the kettle on also helped by tapping into a collective conscious and symbolism.

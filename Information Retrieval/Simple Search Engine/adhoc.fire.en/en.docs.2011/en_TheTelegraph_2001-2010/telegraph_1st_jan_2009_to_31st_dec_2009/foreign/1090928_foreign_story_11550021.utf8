The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Iran test-fires missiles
                                                                                                               Iran test-fires missiles
                            
	Tehran, Sept. 27 (Reuters): Iran test-fired missiles today to show it is prepared to head off any military threat, four days before the country is due to hold rare talks with world powers worried about its nuclear ambitions.        
	Iranian media said Revolutionary Guards launched two types of short-range missiles today in central Iran and tested a multiple missile launcher.        
	State radio said the guards on Monday would test-fire the Shahab 3 missile, which has a range of 2,000km, potentially putting Israel and US bases in the Gulf within reach.

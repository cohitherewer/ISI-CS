          CLAUDINE BEAUMONT                          An Apple employee shows the new iPod Shuffle at a store in Palo Alto, California. (AP)                                  
	London, March 14: Apple is being sued after one of its iPod touch music players exploded in a childs pocket.         
	The lawsuit, which has been filed with a court in Ohio, accuses Apple of gross negligence and recklessness and of behaving maliciously and fraudulently.         
	The legal action has been bought by Lynette Antrobus from Cincinnati, who claims that her sons iPod touch music player spontaneously combusted in his trouser pocket while he was at school on December 4 last year.         
	Documents filed with Ohio southern district court state that the boy, who cannot be named for legal reasons, heard an unexpected pop from the device, which was switched off, followed by a burning sensation and the swift realisation that his pants had caught fire.         
	Plaintiff A.V immediately ran to the bathroom and took off his burning pants with the assistance of a friend, the document reads. [The iPod touch] had burned through Plaintiff A.Vs pants pocket and melted through his nylon/spandex underwear, burning his leg.         
	Antrobus is claiming $75,000 plus punitive damage from Apple on behalf of her son for the second degree burns allegedly inflicted by the iPod touch, and for the pain, mental distress, emotional distress that the victim will endure for the rest of his life.         
	The battery inside the iPod touch is believed to be the source of the alleged explosion. The plaintiffs mother said that she and her son had not been warned in advance of the potential bodily injury that could be caused by the device.         
	She said that the Apple store employees who sold her the iPod touch, and who are also being sued as part of the lawsuit, had a duty to test for this and to warn customers.         
	Apple has not commented on the case. In 2008, Apple Japan paid an undisclosed fee to a man who suffered burns when his Mac laptop battery caught fire.

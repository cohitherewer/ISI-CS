	Islamabad, July 29 (Reuters): A Pakistan Supreme Court hearing into allegations of misrule by former President Pervez Musharraf resumed today without any lawyers present to defend the ex-army chief.         
	Opening proceedings today, Chaudhry received no response when asked who was present to represent Musharraf. We havent received any notice so far and once we get it then we will decide whether to appear before the court or not, Saif Ali Khan, a member of Musharrafs legal team said.

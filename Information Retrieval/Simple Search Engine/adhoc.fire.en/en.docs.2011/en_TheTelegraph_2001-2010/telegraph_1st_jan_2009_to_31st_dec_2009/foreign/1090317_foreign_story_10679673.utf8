The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Mothers work harder
                                                                                                               Mothers work harder
                            
	London, March 16: Mothers do 40 per cent more work around the house free of charge than fathers, research claims.         
	Women spend an average of 74 hours a week on household chores and childcare, tasks that it would cost 32,812 to pay someone else to do, according to insurer Legal and General. By contrast, men spend only 53 hours a week on domestic tasks, although it would still cost 23,296 to pay someone to do everything that fathers do for free. Within these totals, women spend 33 hours a week looking after children, 50 per cent more than the 21.5 hours men spend with their offspring each week. Full-time mothers put in the most work around the house.

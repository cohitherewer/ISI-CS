The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | US woman with wrong embryo gives birth
                                                                                                               US woman with wrong embryo gives birth
                              Carolyn Savage                            
	Toledo (Ohio), Sept. 26 (AP): A woman who had the wrong embryo implanted by a fertility clinic has given birth to a boy, her family said today.        
	Sean and Carolyn Savage released a statement last night saying a healthy baby boy, whom they plan to give up to his biological parents, was delivered on Thursday at St Vincent Mercy Medical Center in Toledo. No information about the baby or the circumstances surrounding the delivery was immediately released.        
	The Savages of Sylvania, outside Toledo, say a fertility clinic outside Ohio transferred the wrong frozen embryo in February. Ten days later, they got a call from a doctor at the clinic saying she was pregnant with someone elses child. The Savages said in an interview with The Associated Press on Wednesday they never considered terminating the pregnancy or trying to fight for custody.        
	They had said earlier this week the baby was to be born in the next two weeks via cesarean section.        
	In the statement, the Savages offered congratulations to the babys biological parents, Paul and Shannon Morell, of suburban Detroit.        
	At this time, we would like to offer our heartfelt congratulations to the Morell family on the birth of their son, the Savages statement said. We wish Paul, Shannon, their twin girls and their new baby boy the best, as they move forward with their lives together.        
	The Savages asked for privacy in the days ahead, saying: Our family is going through a very difficult time.        
	The Morell family did not immediately respond yesterday to an email seeking comment. The Savages extended thanks to people around the world for their support and prayers. They thanked medical professionals for their care and treatment throughout the pregnancy.        
	They have hired attorneys who say they are working to make sure the fertility clinic accepts responsibility.        
	The Morells, who live in Troy, Michigan, found out about the fertility clinic mistake a day after the Savages.        
	The two couples knew nothing about each other. Shannon Morell feared that the pregnant woman would choose abortion, ending their chance to give their 2-year-old twin girls a sibling.        
	A few days passed before they learned that the Savages were not only willing to continue with the pregnancy but also to hand over the baby without hesitation.

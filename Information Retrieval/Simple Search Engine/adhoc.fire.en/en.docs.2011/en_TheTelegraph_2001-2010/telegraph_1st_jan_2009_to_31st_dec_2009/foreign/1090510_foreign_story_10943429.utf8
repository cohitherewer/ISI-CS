The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Obama seeks formula to restore confidence 
                                                                                                               Obama seeks formula to restore confidence

	Washington, May 9: The formula for restoring national confidence  part good policy, part good politics, part good luck  can be hard to find.         
	It eluded Herbert Hoover after the Crash of 1929, Lyndon B. Johnson after the Tet offensive, Jimmy Carter after the energy shock and George W. Bush after Iraq turned from quick victory to bloody insurgency.         
	But President Obama has to try to do just that in a time of crisis. As the government announced this week that the nations largest banks had steered away from the precipice and that job losses were beginning to slow, Obama has carefully begun trying to mine any national leaders most precious commodity in a crisis: optimism.        
	His past references to glimmers of hope were modestly upgraded at the White House yesterday, with his declaration  which he stumbled over, taking some of the assertiveness out of the line  that the gears of our economic engine do appear to be slowly turning once again.         
	His aides have been reaching tentatively for similar metaphors, then adding, as Obama quickly did, that real recovery is months, if not years, ahead.        
	Fear and aversion to risk have been part of the economys problems since the downturn began, and Obamas aides have been highly attuned to the risks of a downward spiral of pessimism. In recent weeks, his economic team has begun flagging signs that the worst could be over, even as it carefully released the results of its bank examinations in a way that suggested a desire to reassure the financial markets and consumers.         
	They got a bit of sacking this week from the Federal Reserve chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, who forecast that the economy was likely to begin growing again by the end of the year.        
	Remember this central paradox of financial crisis, Lawrence H. Summers, Obamas top economic adviser in the White House, said in mid-March, when every arrow was pointing down, that while the problem was caused by excessive complacency and excessive optimism, what we need today is more optimism and more confidence.        
	Obamas own words yesterday signalled that he was worried about the perils of getting out ahead of the numbers.         
	He spent more time talking about the letters he received from the desperate and out-of-work than he did dwelling on the decline in the pace at which Americans are losing their jobs.         
	After all, 539,000 job losses in a single month is not exactly cause for celebration, even if it represents an improvement over the previous month.        
	Theres a kind of artistry to this, isnt there? said Robert Dallek, the presidential historian best known for chronicling how Lyndon Johnson, the consummate politician, never led the public out of its view that everything was falling apart.         
	You dont want to come out and say the recession is over. You want to do a version of Churchills line about how this isnt the end, or the beginning of the end, but rather the end of the beginning.        
	In Obamas case, polls showed that a significant chunk of the public was predisposed to look for the bright side. The proportion of Americans who said the country was moving in the right direction rose to 41 per cent in a New York Times/CBS News poll last month, from 15 per cent in January just before his inauguration, even though by nearly every measure the economy was getting worse during that period.         
	But there are plenty of sceptics out there, from economic historians who know that history is littered with false recoveries, to those who argue that Obama has engineered a turnaround at the cost of phenomenal deficits and a huge new role for the government in the private sector.         
	Robert Reich, President Bill Clintons secretary of labor and one of Obamas critics on the Left, was on television yesterday arguing that to create this sense of optimism Obamas team essentially put its finger on the scale when weighing the ability of the banks to survive a deeper downturn.        
	Given the depth of the concerns about the stability of the financial system and the debates about whether Obama was being tough enough on the banks, administration officials recognised that they could not afford the kind of mistake they made in early February, when Timothy F. Geithner, new to his job as treasury secretary, provided vague assurances that the banks would be saved but said he was not prepared to give details.

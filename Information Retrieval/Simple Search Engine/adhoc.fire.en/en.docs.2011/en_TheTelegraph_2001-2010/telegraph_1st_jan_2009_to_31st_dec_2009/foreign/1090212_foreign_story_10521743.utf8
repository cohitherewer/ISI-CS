The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Obama envoy pushes Pak
                                                                                                               Obama envoy pushes Pak
  - Clear tribal areas of terror safe havens: Holbrooke                            Holbrooke in Islamabad. (Reuters)                                  
	Peshawar, Feb. 11 (Agencies): US special envoy for Afghanistan and Pakistan Richard Holbrooke today visited northwest Pakistans tribal region, where security forces face an intensifying Islamist insurgency, officials said.        
	Holbrooke arrived in Pakistan late on Monday at the beginning of his first visit since his appointment as envoy to a region moving to centre stage of US foreign policy. He met government and military leaders in Islamabad yesterday and headed towards the Afghan border today.        
	He went to the headquarters of the Mohmand Rifles and was given a briefing about military operations, said government official Syed Ahmed Jan, referring to a paramilitary force in Mohmand, one of seven ethnic Pashtun tribal regions bordering Afghanistan.        
	In a tough message to Islamabad, Holbrooke told President Asif Ali Zardari, Prime Minister Yousuf Raza Gilani, foreign minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi, interior ministry chief Rehman Malik and army chief Gen. Ashfaq Parvez Kayani to eliminate terrorist safe havens in the tribal areas, the Dawn newspaper quoted sources as saying.        
	The US envoy said they are as much a threat to Pakistan as they were to the US and Afghanistan.        
	Holbrooke said President Barack Obamas administration was ready to get the Kerry-Lugar bill passed for increasing socio-economic aid to Pakistan, implement the Reconstruction Opportunity Zones project in the tribal areas and meet military hardware needs for counter-insurgency operations.        
	In return, Holbrooke reportedly said, the US wanted to see the tribal areas cleared of safe havens.        
	Obama named Holbrooke as his special representative for Afghanistan and Pakistan last month, handing one of the most arduous US security challenges to the man who brokered the 1995 agreement that ended the Bosnian war.        
	Holbrooke faces a host of challenges in dealing with the war in Afghanistan and an intensifying insurgency in northwest Pakistan while trying to ensure renewed tension between old rivals India and Pakistan doesnt exacerbate the problems. Pakistani forces have extended an offensive into Mohmand that began in August in another tribal region to the north, Bajaur, as part of a campaign to regain control of the northwest.        
	Pakistani jets bombed militant positions in Bajaur today and four militants and a soldier were killed in a clash elsewhere in the region, a military official and residents said.        
	Despite the at times bitter fighting, doubts remain in some quarters over Pakistans commitment to tackling militancy.

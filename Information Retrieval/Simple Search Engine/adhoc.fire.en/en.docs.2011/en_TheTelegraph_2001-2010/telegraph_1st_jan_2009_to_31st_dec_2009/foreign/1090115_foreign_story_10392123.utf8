	London, Jan. 14 (PTI): President-elect Barack Obamas daughters feel lucky to have a President as their father since this gives them the chance to meet their musical heroes, the Jonas Brothers, at the First Kids Inaugural concert.         
	The brothers will perform at the We Are The Future concert on January 19 ahead of Obamas inauguration on January 20. Obama will also get the chance to hear his own musical hero, Stevie Wonder, at the Neighbourhood Ball: An Inauguration Celebration. Other stars include Beyonce and Shakira.

	Los Angeles, July 2: The investigation into Michael Jacksons death intensified today as the US Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA) was called in.         
	The federal agency was brought in by the Los Angeles Police Department to help it unravel the singers use of painkillers, sedatives and anti-depressants, and how he obtained them. Jackson is thought to have used various doctors and police want to track down where he obtained the drugs. He is also thought to have used aliases to get some of the drugs.         
	A DEA spokesman said: We routinely offer assistance to any agency regarding the Federal Controlled Substance Act. However, at this time we have nothing further to comment about the death of Michael Jackson. A powerful drug called Propofol, which is sold under the brand name Diprivan, was discovered by investigators at Jacksons rented home in Los Angeles.

	Twitter triumph    
	 London, April 17: Ashton Kutcher has beaten CNN in a race to become the first user to have more than one million followers on social networking site Twitter, reports The Daily Telegraph.       
	The Hollywood actor came from behind to claim the landmark victory on the microblogging site after challenging the news network to a popularity contest.       
	CNN conceded defeat today after a competition which Kutcher said highlighted how social networking websites were transforming the media.       
	He said it showed how individuals could potentially have an equal voice to major networks. Kutchers aplusk feed went over the million mark early this morning UK time.       
	CNNs Breaking News feed also passed the milestone about half an hour later.

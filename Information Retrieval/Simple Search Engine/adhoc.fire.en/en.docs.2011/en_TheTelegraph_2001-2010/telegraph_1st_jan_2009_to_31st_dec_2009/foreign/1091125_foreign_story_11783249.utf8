                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      5 Pak officers arrested over Headley ties
                              Headley: Web widens                            
	Islamabad, Nov. 24: Five Pakistani army officers have been detained for questioning over possible links to David Coleman Headley and Tahawwur Hussain Rana.        
	The two suspects have been accused of plotting an armed attack on a Danish newspaper, intelligence officials said today.        
	The detentions underscore long-standing allegations that elements in Pakistan support the Lashkar-e-Toiba, which is blamed for last years terror attacks in Mumbai and other strikes in India.        
	Headley and Ranas arrests in Chicago have cast a fresh spotlight on the group.        
	Two Pakistani intelligence officials, speaking anonymously because they are not allowed to release their identity, said phone records showed the five Pakistani officers had contacted Headley and Rana.        
	 They say the five include a retired brigadier general and two active lieutenant colonels, but did not provide more details.        
	Pakistani military officials could not immediately be reached for confirmation.        
	The FBI says Headley travelled to Pakistan this year and may have been headed there when he was arrested on October 3 at Chicagos Hare International Airport en route to Philadelphia.        
	Indian officials say Headley also may have been involved in planning the Mumbai terror attack, which occurred a year ago on Thursday.        
	Headley, 49, and Rana, 48, are accused of plotting to kill one of the editors and a cartoonist at Danish paper Jyllands-Posten for publishing 12 cartoons in 2005 depicting the Prophet Mohammad, which ignited outrage in much of the Muslim world.        
	The FBI has said only that it has evidence Headley and Rana were in contact with the Lashkar-e-Toiba, which the Indian government blames for the Mumbai attacks that left 166 dead and 308 wounded. US authorities say Headley was in contact with the group while he allegedly carried out reconnaissance this year near the newspaper offices in Copenhagen. They say Rana last year advised a member of the group on how to slip people into the US. Headley is a US citizen who changed his name from Daood Gilani in 2006 to get across international boundaries without too many questions at customs, according to an FBI affidavit.        
	He and Rana, a Pakistani immigrant to Canada who has lived in Chicago for a decade, are charged in criminal complaints with conspiring to provide material support to terrorism and providing material support to terrorism. They will not enter pleas until they are indicted.        
	Lashkar-e-Toiba, which means Army of the Pure, was established in the early 1990s to reclaim territories it views as Muslim land, primarily Kashmir. Analysts say it was largely a creation of Pakistani security agencies.        
	Doctors release        
	Pakistan is to lodge a plea with America for the release a female doctor charged with collusion with al Qaida after she was arrested in Afghanistan last year.        
	The neuroscientist, who was born in Pakistan and is a US trained specialist, stands accused of shooting at US officials and working with the al Qaida in the war zone.        
	Rehman Malik, Pakistans interior minister, told senators that the government would appeal directly to President Barack Obama for her release.        
	American prosecutors maintain that Dr Siddiqui returned to Pakistan in March 2003 after the FBI issued a global alert for her and an exhusband, Amjad Khan.        
	 She is now married to Ammar alBaluchi, a Guantanamo Bay inmate who will face trial in New York next year. Dr Siddiques family claim she disappeared for most of the five year interval between 2003 and 2008 and claim she was in US custody at Bagram airport in Afghanistan for most of that period.

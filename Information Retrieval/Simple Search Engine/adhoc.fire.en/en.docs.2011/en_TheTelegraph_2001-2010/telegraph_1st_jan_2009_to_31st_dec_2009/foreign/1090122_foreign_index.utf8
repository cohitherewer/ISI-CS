                                                                                                                                          For two-and-a-half months, he was PEBO to us: President-elect Barack Obama. Yesterday, he became POTUS: President of the United States. The only thing that will probably not change is his lack of drama, the complete absence of any emotion and a loathing for nervousness. Everything else has already                 President Barack Obama would order the US prison at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, to be closed within one year if he signs a draft order obtained by Reuters today.                   Just in time for move-in day, the Bush twins offered their best advice yesterday to Sasha and Malia Obama on living in a magical place called the White House.                   If ever two little girls deserved a puppy, its Malia and Sasha Obama.

  - Scientist is history: Pak                            Khan in Islamabad. (Reuters)                                  
	Islamabad, Feb. 7 (AP): Pakistan today defended the easing of restrictions on Abdul Qadeer Khan, saying the man who once confessed to passing nuclear secrets to Iran, North Korea and Libya no longer posed a risk because his smuggling network had been dismantled.        
	The foreign ministry said Pakistan had investigated Khans past proliferation, shared its findings with the UN nuclear watchdog and put in tight controls to prevent anything similar from happening again.        
	We have successfully broken the network that he had set up and today he has no say and has no access to any of the sensitive areas of Pakistan, foreign minister Shah Mehmood Qureshi said. A.Q. Khan is history.        
	Khan emerged from five years of de facto house arrest yesterday after a court declared him a free citizen subject to a secret agreement with the government.        
	The move alarmed the new US government, which has made countering the spread of nuclear weapons to countries including Iran a top foreign policy priority. The White House said President Barack Obama wants assurances from Pakistan that Khan is not involved in the activity that led to his detention.         
	State department spokesman Gordon Duguid said Khan remained a serious proliferation risk. Pakistani Prime Minister Yousuf Raza Gilani said today that international concern about Khans new freedoms would be taken care of. He didnt elaborate.         
	How much latitude has been granted to Khan, who has begun distancing himself from his confession and denying he did anything illegal, remains unclear. Khans wife told The Associated Press today that her husband, a 72-year-old who has suffered from a string of illnesses including cancer, was receiving friends at home.        
	Hostage beheaded        
	Taliban fighters beheaded a Polish hostage in Pakistan today, according to a militant spokesman who said the body wouldnt be handed over until some captured Taliban were released. Speaking in Germany, Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk said his government had received unofficial confirmation Piotr Stancza, an engineer and a father of one, had been killed.

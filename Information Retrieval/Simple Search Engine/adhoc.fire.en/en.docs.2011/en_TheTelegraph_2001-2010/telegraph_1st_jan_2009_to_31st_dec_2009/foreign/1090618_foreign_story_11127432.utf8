	Tehran, June 17 (Reuters): Tens of thousands of Iranians marched in quiet defiance today in protest against moderate Mir Hossein Mousavis election defeat, ahead of a day of mourning he has called for those killed in clashes.        
	In a fifth successive day of protests, Mousavi supporters demonstrated in central Tehran against the official victory of hardline President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad in Fridays vote, which has caused the worst unrest since the 1979 Islamic revolution.        
	At least seven people were killed in street battles in Tehran on Monday, according to state media. Other protests have flared up in cities elsewhere in Iran.        
	A number of our countrymen were wounded or martyred, Mousavi said, calling tomorrow a day of mourning.        
	I ask the people to express their solidarity with the families ... by coming together in mosques or taking part in peaceful demonstrations, Mousavi said on his website.        
	Bloodshed, mass protests, arrests and a media crackdown have focused attention on the worlds fifth-biggest oil exporter which is locked in a dispute with the West over its nuclear programme.        
	After Mousavis web message, his supporters poured into Tehrans Haft-e Tir Square, ignoring an Interior Ministry warning, witnesses said. They were mostly dressed in black with wristbands and headbands in Mousavis green campaign colours.        
	Most of the protesters, some holding pictures of Mousavi as well as green balloons, were silent and making victory signs. One young woman held a picture of one of those killed during post-election violence.        
	Asked if she was afraid of reprisals, another woman who gave her age as 25, said:Why should we be? We are many and they cannot resist our demands.        
	The mass protests are a direct challenge to the authorities who have kept a tight grip on dissent since the US-backed shah was overthrown in 1979 after months of protest.        
	The political earthquake set off by Fridays vote prompted President Barack Obama, who had urged the Iranian leadership to unclench its fist, to say the upheaval showed Iranian people are not convinced with the legitimacy of the election.        
	Discord within Irans ruling system has never been so public. The Mousavi camp is backed by traditional establishment figures, such as former Presidents Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani and Mohammad Khatami, concerned about how Ahmadinejads truculent foreign policy and populist economics are shaping Irans future.         
	State television has said the main agents behind the turmoil have been arrested along with guns and explosives.        
	Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei will lead Friday prayers and is expected to repeat his appeal for calm.        
	He has already urged people to back Ahmadinejad but, despite Khameneis calls for national unity, Mousavi supporters have continued to pour on to the streets.        
	Security forces arrested a pro-reform activist and an editor today, while a provincial prosecutor said those causing unrest faced the death penalty. An official inquiry was launched into an attack on university students.        
	After Mondays deaths, Mousavi asked followers to call off a rally yesterday but it went ahead in a different location. Yesterdays gathering was addressed by Faezeh Rafsanjani, daughter of the former President who backed Mousavi. Her public support was another sign of high-level rifts.         
	Among his supporters, Mousavi attracted many Iranians who believed Ahmadinejad had mishandled the economy, curbed social freedoms and alienated Iran from the outside world.

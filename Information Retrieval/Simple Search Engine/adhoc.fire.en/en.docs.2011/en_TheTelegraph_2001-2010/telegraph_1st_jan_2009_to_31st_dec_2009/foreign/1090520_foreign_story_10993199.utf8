The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Country free from terror, says Rajapaksa

	Colombo, May 19: President Mahinda Rajapaksa declared a final victory in the countrys 26-year war against the Tamil Tiger rebels, using a speech before parliament this morning to declare that the country had triumphed over terrorism and to call for national unity.        
	Rajapaksa addressed parliament a day after the government information service sent a text message to cellphones across the country saying that Vellupillai Prabhakaran, the elusive chief of the Tamil Tigers, had been killed. State television also broke into regular programming to announce the news.        
	A rebel spokesman today denied the governments claim, saying on a pro-rebel website that the dear leader, Prabhakaran, was alive and safe. He will continue to lead the quest for dignity and freedom for the Tamil people, said the spokesman, Selvarasa Pathmanathan. We have liberated the whole country from LTTE terrorism, the President said before parliament.        
	In his nationally televised speech, Rajapaksa emphasised the need for working towards unity. He reached out to the countrys marginalised Tamil minority by making brief remarks in the Tamil language. He said the war had not been waged against them but against the rebel group.        
	Our intention was to save the Tamil people from the cruel grip of the LTTE, he said in the language of the Sinhalese majority.         
	The governments military victory marked the end of Asias longest civil war, and of one of the worlds most enduring insurgencies. The rebels once controlled a quarter of Sri Lankas territory as they pressed their campaign for an independent homeland for the countrys Tamil minority.        
	Prabhakarans death, if confirmed, could mean the end of the rebel movement. A secretive figure whose whereabouts were rarely known, he built himself into the leader of a powerful guerrilla force that was known for its strong internal discipline and brutal tactics.

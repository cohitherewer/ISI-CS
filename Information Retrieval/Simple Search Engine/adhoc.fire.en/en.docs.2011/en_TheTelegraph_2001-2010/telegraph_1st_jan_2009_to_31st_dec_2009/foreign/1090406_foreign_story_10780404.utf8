The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Mosque attack in Pakistan kills 22
                                                                                                               Mosque attack in Pakistan kills 22
                            
	Chakwal, April 5 (Reuters): A suicide bomber blew himself up at a gathering of minority Shia Muslims in Pakistan today killing 22 people a day after a deadly suicide attack in the capital, police said.        
	The attack in the central city of Chakwal came a day after a pilotless US drone aircraft killed 13 people including militants in the northwest and a suicide bomber killed eight soldiers in Islamabad.        
	About 2,000 people had gathered at a Shia mosque in Chakwal, about 100km south of Islamabad, for a ceremony when the bomber struck.        
	There was a break in the ceremony and some people were going out and others were coming in when all of a sudden a young man tried to run into the crowd, said witness Amjad Hussain.        
	When guards tried to stop him at the gate he blew himself up.        
	Regional police chief Nasir Khan Durrani said 22 people had been killed and 35 wounded. Durrani said the death toll would have been much higher if the bomber had managed to force his way into the crowd.        
	Outside the mosque, blood was splattered over the gate and walls while shoes and other possessions were strewn on the ground. Three mangled motorcycles lay outside the gate.

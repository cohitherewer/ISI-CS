	Dhaka, March 5 (PTI): Bangladesh today sought UN help in the investigation into the BDR mutiny in which 73 army officers were killed.        
	Dhaka also said FBI and Scotland Yard teams are expected to join the probe soon.        
	We have made the request (to the UN) through our permanent mission in New York and want to know how (and) in what extent the global body (can) come up with their assistance, foreign secretary Touhid Hossain told reporters in Dhaka.        
	Earlier, Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina told the parliament that the government had sought the FBIs help and would also seek the UN and British assistance to unearth the plot behind the BDR revolt and bring the killers and their patrons to justice.

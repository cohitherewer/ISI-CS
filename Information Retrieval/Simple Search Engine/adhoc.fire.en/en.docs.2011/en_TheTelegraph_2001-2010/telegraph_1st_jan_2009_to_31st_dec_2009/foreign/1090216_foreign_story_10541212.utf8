The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Cub steps into Tiger dads shoes
                                                                                                               Cub steps into Tiger dads shoes
                              Prabhakaran                            
	Colombo, Feb. 15 (PTI): Tamil Tiger chief Velupillai Prabhakarans son Charles Anthony is commanding an LTTE contingent alongside top rebel leaders, two militants who surrendered recently have revealed.        
	Reports said the arrested Black Tiger rebels, part of the LTTE wing that masterminds suicide attacks, had revealed that Anthony heads the air and computer units of the Tamil Tigers.        
	Anthony, who returned from Ireland in 2006, has reportedly got a degree in aeronautical engineering.        
	He is believed to have played a key role in building the LTTEs air wing, which conducted a night raid on the Sri Lankan military air base inside Colombos international airport in March 2007.        
	In an interview with the state-run Sunday Observer, the two Black Tiger rebels claimed that Anthony was commanding their forces with other prominent leaders.        
	The duo had surrendered to government troops on January 28 after a failed attempt to bomb the bund of the Iranamadu Tank, the Sunday Observer said. A successful strike could have caused immense disaster.        
	Anthony and LTTE Sea Tiger chief Soosai had briefed them on the mission, for an underwater demolition on January 20. But, fed up with the behaviour of the groups leadership, they decided to surrender, the newspaper said, quoting the suicide cadres.        
	The rebels also said Prabhakaran was still in LTTE-dominated Wanni in the north.

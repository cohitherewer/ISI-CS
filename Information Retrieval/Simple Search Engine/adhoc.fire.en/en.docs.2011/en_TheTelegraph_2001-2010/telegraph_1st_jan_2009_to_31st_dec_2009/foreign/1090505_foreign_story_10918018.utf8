The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Ex-Bangla spy chief held in Ulfa arms case
                                                                                                               Ex-Bangla spy chief held in Ulfa arms case
                            
	Dhaka, May 4 (PTI): Bangladeshs former chief of National Security Intelligence (NSI) was arrested in a mid-night raid for his involvement in the Ulfa weapon smuggling case.        
	 Shahabuddin Ahmed, who was sacked as wing commander of the Bangladesh Air Force, is the second highest ranked former official to be hauled up by the Sheikh Hasina government in the case.        
	Ahmed was arrested for his involvement in transporting 10 truckloads of weapons to Ulfa militants holed up in hideouts in northeastern India.         
	The former security chief was brought to Chittagong under tight security.        
	Criminal Investigation Department (CID) officials earlier this month arrested NSI field officer Akbar Hossain Khan, who later confessed to have arranged the weapons trucks in line with Ahmeds orders.         
	According to sources, Ahmed had close links with the former BNP regime led by Khaleda Zia.         
	The weapons included over 27,000 grenades, 150 rocket launchers, over 11 lakh ammunition rounds and 1,100 submachine guns. They were unloaded at a government jetty on April 2004, but were seized by security agencies.         
	Investigations revealed the involvement of leading politicians in the case. Police have so far questioned 26 navy officials, who were serving at that time in Chittagong. Earlier, officials said the case was being probed again as there was a deliberate attempt to suppress facts in the case.

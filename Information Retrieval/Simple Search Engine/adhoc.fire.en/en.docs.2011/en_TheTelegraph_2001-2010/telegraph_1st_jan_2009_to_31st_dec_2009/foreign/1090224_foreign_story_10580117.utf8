The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Punters make crores on Slumdog
                                                                                                               Punters make crores on Slumdog
          ANANYA SENGUPTA                              
	New Delhi, Feb. 23: Punters in the country were on tenterhooks on their seats, much like young Jamal in Slumdog Millionaire, while their fates were being decided at the Oscars ceremony in faraway Los Angeles.        
	In the end, they celebrated like the fictional slum boy, many of them having become considerably richer if not millionaires. Indian punters, still new to betting on films and especially the Oscars, had placed large sums over the past few days on Slumdog. Sources said at least Rs 225 crore rode on the film in the country, where a ban on organised betting has driven the industry underground.        
	Bets were placed on A.R. Rahman, director Danny Boyle and the film itself (for Best Picture), all of them bookies favourites.        
	I bet Rs 20,000 on Rahman and earned Rs 36,000. Now I wish I had bet more, said a man who plans to start renovating his house in suburban Mumbai before the rains.        
	I didnt want to take a big chance in these times of slowdown, but Im glad I took a shot at Rahman winning. Rough estimates by insiders suggest that as much as Rs 50 crore had ridden on Rahman alone.        
	I wasnt too sure about Rahman but the film was great. I read up a lot on it before I decided to bet on it, said a Mumbai trader. I placed Rs 40,000 on the film and got back something close to Rs 1.2 lakh. The trader said the decision to bet wasnt easy.        
	Betting on the Oscars is something of a first for all of us. Our betting circles generally deal with cricket and stocks. We were very apprehensive since we didnt know where to bet and how, he said.        
	But then things were centralised in Mumbai and bets started pouring in from all parts of the country. I have heard that five to six big bookies handled the betting details, based in Mumbai.        
	Sources said punters in Ahmedabad, another bookie hub, had made Rs 50-60 crore thanks to Slumdog. Many of the punters had watched the films Hindi version; now some are planning parties for friends and family over their victory and that of the film.        
	I woke early today to watch the award function. I failed to understand most of it but I knew that Rahman had won when they announced his name. I felt so proud when he said Mere paas ma hai, a punter said. Yes, I have earned a little because of his hard work but that doesnt take me disregard the fact that he has made all of us proud.         
	He plans to watch his money-making moment again when the ceremony is replayed on TV this evening.

                                                                                                               Musharraf pact
                            
	New Delhi/Islamabad, Sept. 17: Former Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif has accused Britain and the US of negotiating secret guarantees for former President Pervez Musharraf to avoid treason charges after his resignation.        
	The claim was made after President Asif Zardari told guests at a private dinner that foreign countries had played a key role in brokering the deal which allowed Musharraf to stand down in 2008.        
	Sharif has intensified pressure for Musharrafs arrest with a legal and political campaign for him to be charged for imposing emergency rule in November 2007. The countrys Supreme Court has already declared the move unconstitutional.         
	Britain has always denied it played any role in Musharrafs resignation deal or talks to spare him from treason charges. Britain has been an interested observer, not an implementer, said one western diplomat.         
	But sources close to Musharraf have alleged that David Miliband, the foreign secretary, and Sir Mark Lyle Grant, a former High Commissioner to Pakistan, played a lead role in brokering an understanding over his resignation.         
	The source said Musharrafs decision to leave Pakistan to live in London was not part of the deal.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Obama keeps US Fed chief
                                                                                                               Obama keeps US Fed chief
          JEFF ZELENY AND EDMUND L. ANDREWS                          Federal Reserve chairman Ben Bernanke. (AP)                                  
	Oak Bluffs (Massachusetts), Aug. 25: President Obama said today that he would nominate Ben S. Bernanke to a second term as chairman of the Federal Reserve, seeking to keep an air of stability in the financial markets as the nation inches towards an economic recovery.        
	As an expert on the causes of the Great Depression, Im sure Ben never imagined that he would be part of a team responsible for preventing another, Obama said. But because of his background, his temperament, his courage, and his creativity, thats exactly what he has helped to achieve.        
	The President interrupted his week-long vacation to Marthas Vineyard to disclose his decision, which was timed to coincide with the opening of the American financial markets this morning. The announcement also came just before the White House released a new projection that the deficit would reach $9 trillion over 10 years.        
	Bernanke, a Republican who was first appointed by President Bush nearly four years ago, stood at the Presidents side as the announcement was made.        
	Ben approached a financial system on the verge of collapse with calm and wisdom; with bold action and outside-the-box thinking that has helped put the brakes on our economic freefall, Obama said. Almost none of the decisions he or any of us made have been easy.

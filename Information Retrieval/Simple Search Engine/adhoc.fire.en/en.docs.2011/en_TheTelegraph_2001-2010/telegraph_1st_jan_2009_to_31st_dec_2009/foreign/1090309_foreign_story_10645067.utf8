The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Obama open to Taliban talks
                                                                                                               Obama open to Taliban talks
          HELENE COOPER AND SHERYL GAY STOLBERG                          Obama: Reaching out                                  
	Washington, March 8: President Barack Obama declared in an interview that the US was not winning the war in Afghanistan and opened the door to a reconciliation process in which the American military would reach out to moderate elements of the Taliban, much as it did with Sunni militias in Iraq.        
	Obama pointed to the success in peeling Iraqi insurgents away from more hard-core elements of al Qaida in Mesopotamia. There may be some comparable opportunities in Afghanistan and in the Pakistani region, he said.        
	In a 35-minute conversation with The New York Times aboard Air Force One on Friday, Obama spoke at length about the struggle with terrorism in Afghanistan and elsewhere, staking out positions that at times seemed more comparable to those of his predecessor than many of Obamas more liberal supporters would like.         
	He did not rule out the option of snatching terrorism suspects out of hostile countries.        
	Asked if the US was winning in Afghanistan, a war he adopted as his own last month by ordering an additional 17,000 troops sent there, Obama replied flatly, No.        
	Obama said on the campaign trail last year that the possibility of breaking away some elements of the Taliban should be explored. But now he has started a review of policy toward Afghanistan and Pakistan intended to find a new strategy, and he signaled that reconciliation could emerge as an important initiative, mirroring the strategy used by General David H. Petraeus in Iraq.        
	If you talk to General Petraeus, I think he would argue that part of the success in Iraq involved reaching out to people that we would consider to be Islamic fundamentalists, but who were willing to work with us because they had been alienated by the tactics of al Qaida in Iraq, Obama said.         
	At the same time, he acknowledged that outreach may not yield the same success. The situation in Afghanistan is, if anything, more complex, he said. You have a less governed region, a history of fierce independence among tribes. Those tribes are multiple and sometimes operate at cross purposes, and so figuring all that out is going to be much more of a challenge.

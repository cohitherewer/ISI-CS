          ERIC SCHMITT AND DAVID E. SANGER                          Rescue workers take injured schoolboys to hospital after a suicide attack Badabher, near Peshawar. (Reuters)                                  
	Washington, Nov. 16: The Obama administration is stepping up pressure on Pakistan to expand and reorient its fight against the Taliban and al Qaida, warning that failing to do so would undercut the new strategy and troop increase for Afghanistan that President Obama is preparing to approve, American officials say.         
	While Afghanistan has dominated the public discussion of Obamas strategy, which officials say could be announced as early as this week, Pakistan is returning to centre stage in administration planning. As the President travelled to Asia, his national security adviser, General James L. Jones, was quietly sent to Islamabad.         
	His message, officials said, was that the new American strategy would work only if Pakistan broadened its fight beyond the militants attacking its cities and security forces and went after the groups that use havens in Pakistan for plotting and carrying out attacks against American troops in Afghanistan, as well as support networks for Qaida.         
	Jones praised the Pakistani operation in South Waziristan but urged Pakistani officials to combat extremists who fled to North Waziristan.         
	Jones also delivered a letter from Obama to Pakistans President, Asif Ali Zardari, in which Obama said he expected Zardari to rally the nations political and national security institutions in a united campaign against extremists threatening Pakistan and Afghanistan, said an official briefed on the conversations.         
	For their part, Pakistani officials have told the Americans that they harbour two deep fears about Obamas new strategy: that the US will add too many troops on the Afghan side of the border, and that the American effort will end too soon.         
	Their first concern, described by officials on both sides of the recent discussions, is that if Obama commits an additional 30,000 or more troops, it will inevitably push more Taliban fighters across the border into Pakistani territory and complicate the Waziristan offensive.

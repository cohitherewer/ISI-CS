The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | UK, French nuclear submarines collide
                                                                                                               UK, French nuclear submarines collide
          AISLINN SIMPSON                          HMS Vanguard: Close shave                                  
	London, Feb. 16: Two British and French nuclear submarines collided in heavy seas in the Atlantic.         
	HMS Vanguard and Le Triomphant are understood to have both been severely damaged in the underwater accident earlier this month.         
	Both are fitted with state-of-the-art technology aimed at detecting other submarines, but it apparently failed completely.         
	Although both France and Britain insist that security was not compromised during the collision and there was no danger of a nuclear incident, inquiries are now under way in both countries.         
	French navy sources confirm that Le Triomphant was returning from a 70-day tour of duty when the incident occurred.        
	It happened in heavy seas, and in the middle of the night between February 3 and 4, and left Le Triomphants sonar dome all but destroyed.        
	The sonar dome should have detected the Vanguard but Le Triomphants crew of 101 claimed to have neither saw nor heard anything.        
	The French tried to play down the collision, with a navy spokesman saying: The collision did not result in injuries among the crew.

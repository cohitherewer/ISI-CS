The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Karzai agrees to run-off vote
                                                                                                               Karzai agrees to run-off vote

	Kabul, Oct. 20 (Reuters): President Hamid Karzai agreed to face a second round of voting in Afghanistans disputed election today after a UN-led fraud inquiry tossed out enough of his votes to trigger a run-off.        
	President Obama, British Prime Minister Gordon Brown and UN secretary-general Ban Ki-moon all welcomed Karzais decision to accept the run-off. The November 7 election will pit Karzai once again against his main election rival, former foreign minister Abdullah Abdullah.         
	After hours of closed-door talks with western diplomats, Karzai appeared tense as he welcomed the ruling by the Afghan Independent Election Commission.        
	 The ruling cut his tally to 49.7 per cent from the preliminary first-round result of 54.6 per cent  below the 50 per cent needed for an outright win.         
	We believe that this decision of the IEC is legitimate, legal and constitutional and that it strengthens the path towards democracy, said Karzai, US Senator John Kerry by his side and UN Afghanistan envoy Kai Eide standing between them.        
	The IEC made its ruling after a separate UN-backed fraud panel invalidated tens of thousands of votes for Karzai this week.

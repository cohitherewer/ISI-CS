	Bruce weds model     
	 London, March 23: The film star Bruce Willis, 54, of Die Hard fame, has tied the knot with model Emma Heming, in a Caribbean island ceremony attended by his ex-wife Demi Moore and their three daughters, his spokesman said yesterday, reports The Daily Telegraph.      
	Moores husband, the Hollywood actor Ashton Kutcher was also at the event in the Turks and Caicos islands, the spokesman said. Heming, 32, is a model for the racy Victorias Secret, line of lingerie. US television said the A-list celebrity guests included pop queen Madonna.       
	Moore, 46, was married to Willis from 1987 to 2000. The couple had three daughters, Rumor, 20, Scout, 17, and Tallulah Belle, 15. The couple met through mutual friends more than a year ago. This is the first marriage for Heming. They plan a civil ceremony when they return to California.

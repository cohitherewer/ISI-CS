	Islamabad, March 14 (Agencies): The Pakistan government today said it would appeal a court ruling that barred Nawaz Sharif and his brother from elected office, in the first major concession to Opposition leaders that came amid stepped-up US efforts to end the standoff.        
	The decision to file a review petition came hours after information minister Sherry Rehman resigned over restrictions on media coverage of protests by lawyers and Opposition parties campaigning for an independent judiciary, and the army was put on standby.        
	Officials said US secretary of state Hillary Clinton telephoned President Asif Ali Zardari and Sharif and voiced concern over the turmoil the country had lurched into.        
	Clinton urged a settlement through negotiations, Sharifs spokesman Pervaiz Rasheed said.        
	Hours later the government announced it would appeal the court ruling in the coming week.        
	The federal government will file a review petition in the supreme court against the verdict of the supreme court, a spokesman for Zardari said in a statement.        
	This is part of the governments policy to resolve political issues through reconciliation and negotiation, spokesman Farhatullah Babar said. We want to bring down the political temperature.        
	Sharifs party dismissed the decision as an eyewash.        
	We will go ahead with the long march. No one can stop it. It will be a milestone in Pakistans history, Sharif, who threw his weight behind the lawyers protest after Zardari dismissed the provincial administration in Punjab led by his brother, told a rally in Lahore this evening.        
	As far as the review petition is concerned, we do not recognise these courts, the chief justice of these courts because these courts are unconstitutional, a spokesman for Sharifs PML(N) said.        
	These courts have been established by Pervez Musharraf through an emergency order. Therefore, they do not have constitutional position, Siddiq Al Farooq told a TV channel.        
	Police temporarily detained dozens of activists across the country, including five people at a gathering of hundreds of lawyers and Sharif supporters in the central city of Multan.        
	So far our attitude is soft, but we can change our strategy, Ali Ahmad Kurd, the leader of the countrys lawyers movement, said in Quetta after authorities allegedly prevented him from boarding a plane to Lahore.        
	When one path is blocked, God opens 100 others, and we will reach Lahore and then Islamabad, said Kurd, whose road convoy was turned back by police a day earlier.        
	Army spokesman Major General Athar Abbas said the government put the army on notice that troops might be needed to protect sensitive areas in Islamabad and elsewhere.        
	When the situation deteriorates, gets out of hand of police, paramilitary (troops), only then the army is deployed, Abbas said.        
	Earlier in the day, in another sign of strain on the government, information minister Rehman announced her resignation from the cabinet after the private Geo TV channel complained that cable TV companies had blocked its programming in several cities. Geo accused Zardari of ordering the restrictions  an allegation denied by his spokesman.        
	Rehman, who has often spoken in defence of media freedoms, didnt explain her decision, and the channel appeared to be available again today in major cities.        
	Zardari said Rehman was ditching the government at a time of crisis, but she replied that she saw no point in continuing in her post, a source said. Rehman also told the President that the media could not be switched on and off like a light bulb, the source added.

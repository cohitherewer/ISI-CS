The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Coming soon: Viagra in a cream

	London, Sept. 19: A rub-on cream potentially as effective as Viagra but without any side effects is being developed by scientists.        
	The development could help millions of men every year. Current erectile dysfunction drugs, called phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5) inhibitors, can cause side effects, ranging from headaches to more serious complications.        
	 Men who have suffered a heart attack or a stroke are warned to be cautious when they take the medication, while an estimated one in three men find that the drugs do not work.        
	Doctors have now developed a new way of minimising side effects by delivering drugs directly to the affected area using tiny particles, smaller than the size of pollen grains. Tests on rats have shown that the drugs are effective in nine out of 10 cases. The researchers behind the breakthrough now say that they plan to test the mediation on humans, but warn it could be another 10 years before the product is on the market.

	Rapper ruckus    
	 New York, Sept. 14: US rapper Kanye West stole the show for the wrong reasons at the MTV Video Music Awards last night when he invaded the stage and interrupted a winner to say that the award should have gone elsewhere, reports The Times, London.      
	West grabbed the microphone as Taylor Swift, a teenage country singer, was halfway through her acceptance speech for the prize  known as a Moonman  for best female video.      
	I always wondered what it would be like to maybe win one of these someday, but never actually thought it would happen, Swift had begun to say, when West snatched the microphone from her hand.      
	Taylor, Im really happy for you, and Im gonna let you finish, but Beyonce had one of the best videos of all time, said West, who had been spotted earlier swigging alcohol on the red carpet. Swift did not finish her speech, the crowd began to boo, and Beyonce looked shocked and embarrassed.     
	Kate looks

	Baghdad, July 18: The Iraqi government has moved to sharply restrict the movement and activities of US forces in a new reading of a six-month-old US-Iraqi security agreement that has startled American commanders and raised concerns about the safety of their troops.         
	In a curt missive issued by the Baghdad Operations Command on July 2  the day after Iraqis celebrated the withdrawal of US troops to bases outside city centres  Iraqs top commanders told their US counterparts to stop all joint patrols quot; in Baghdad. It said US re-supply convoys could travel only at night and ordered the Americans to notify us immediately of any violations of the agreement.        
	The strict application of the agreement coincides with what US military officials in Washington say has been an escalation of attacks against their forces by Iranian-backed Shia extremist groups, to which they have been unable to fully respond. If extremists realise some of the limitations that we have, thats a vulnerability they could use against us, a senior US military intelligence official said.

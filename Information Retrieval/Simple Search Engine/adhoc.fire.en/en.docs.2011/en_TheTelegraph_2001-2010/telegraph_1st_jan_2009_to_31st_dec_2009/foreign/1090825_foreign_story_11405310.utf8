The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Pak raids net militants, foil attacks
                                                                                                               Pak raids net militants, foil attacks

	Karachi, Aug. 24 (Reuters): Pakistani police have arrested seven men belonging to an al Qaida-linked militant group who were planning to attack high-profile targets in Karachi.        
	The militants, belonging to the Lashkar-e-Jhangvi (LeJ) group, were arrested in a raid in the upmarket defence neighbourhood where they had rented a bungalow, superintendent of police Fayyaz Khan said late yesterday.        
	All of these militants belong to the LeJ and they were planning to attack important government buildings and senior government officials, Khan said.        
	We have recovered three suicide jackets, four AK-47 rifles, four pistols and 15kg of explosives, he said.        
	Pakistan, a US ally, has seen a rise in attacks by Islamist militants over the past two years.         
	It has responded since April with army offensives against militant strongholds in the northwest.        
	Karachi is Pakistans commercial hub and home to its main stock exchange and central bank. Many foreign companies involved in Pakistan also have offices there.        
	Khan said one of the detained men, Muhammad Shahzad, had also been involved in planning an attack on former President Pervez Musharraf and another attack on former Prime Minister Shaukat Aziz.        
	The Sunni LeJ is one of Pakistans most notorious Qaida-linked groups that began by targeting minority Shias.        
	It later graduated to more audacious attacks, such as the truck bombing of Islamabads Marriott Hotel in September last year in which 55 people were killed, the government says.        
	Interior minister Rehman Malik told CNN yesterday that security forces had in the past month foiled a militant attack on parliament in Islamabad.        
	And police in the eastern province of Punjab said they had foiled a plot to launch a series of suicide attacks by Taliban militants on foreign targets and minority Shias.        
	We have arrested six would-be suicide bombers and their handler. They had links with Baitullah Mehsuds group, senior police officer Usman Anwar said referring to the Pakistani Taliban chief who is believed to have been killed in a US missile strike on August 5. The militants planned to target offices and installations of the Norwegian telecommunication company Telenor, Anwar said.        
	Gunmen shot dead an Afghan journalist known as an outspoken critic of the Taliban as he travelled by bus through Pakistans Khyber Pass today, a Pakistani government official said.        
	Janullah Hashimzada was bureau chief in Pakistan for Afghanistans Shamshad television channel and was travelling from Afghanistan when he was attacked.        
	The attackers in a Toyota Corolla car intercepted the bus and made it stop and then they went inside and shot him dead, Rehan Khattak, a government official in Jamrud, the main town in the Khyber region, said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Geeta family plea to witnesses
                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      Geeta family plea to witnesses
          AMIT ROY                              
	London, Nov. 23: Like every Indian family, Geeta Aulakh familys came to England looking for a more prosperous new life but today her devastated mother, father and younger sister held a news conference in London to speak of their nightmare and appeal for witnesses following her brutal murder on Monday last week.        
	Geeta, a 28-year-old receptionist at Sunrise Radio in Southall, was found dying in a street in nearby Greenford.        
	What is bizarre about her murder  and probably unprecedented  is that her right hand had been hacked off by a sharp weapon like a sword or a machete.        
	The familys appeal for the public to help the police came as a youth of 18, Sher Singh, 18, of Southall, was due to appear at Ealing Magistrates Court today, charged with murder. Others may be involved.        
	Eleven other men, including Geetas 31-year-old husband, Harpreet  he has denied being involved in any way  have been questioned by police and released on bail. That does not put them in the clear nor does it incriminate them.        
	What was heart rending was to witness an ordinary Indian family, who could never have imagined being in such a situation, being put up for a press conference by the police  a routine procedure when the resulting publicity often brings in valuable clues.        
	Police believe witnesses possibly saw something of what might have happened last Monday but have decided not to get involved by going to the law  especially if there might be reprisals from the killer or killers.        
	There has been informed speculation that Geeta was held down, possibly by more than one assailant, while she was subjected to a frenzied attack. She did not die on the spot but four hours later in hospital.        
	Her maiden name was Shinh and today the press conference was given by her sister, Anita Shinh. Her mother Nardesh, who arrived in hospital and called out her daughters name minutes before she died, and father, Lakhwinder Shinh, could barely cope with the bright lights of a harsh press conference.         
	Geeta was attacked as she was on her way after work to pick up her sons, Karam, 10, and Tejdeep, eight, from their childminder.        
	Her nephews could not understand why their mother was not coming home, Anita said. Listening to them ask for their mummy breaks our hearts and finding the words to tell them that their mother is no more  words cannot describe it. When one of Geetas boys asked where his mummy is, I told him she is the brightest star in the sky now.        
	Anita continued: My younger brother is still in shock. We do not know what to do with ourselves, we cant eat or sleep. It feels like we are living in a nightmare and we expect to wake up every day. We cannot believe this has happened in our community to one of our own family. Its like something you see on TV. You cant believe its happened to your family, to your mother, your sister, your brother. We just want to be strong for the children.        
	She spoke with much affection about Geeta. She was beautiful, loving and caring.         
	Shed never hurt anyone in her life. She lived for her two boys. Obviously they do not know the ins and outs of it all, but they know that mummy is not going to tuck them into bed tonight. One said, Is she going to come one final time to say goodbye? I just do not think they believe it, they expect her to come through the door. They are just too young to understand.        
	It was revealed that Geeta had been threatened in the months before her death but details were not given.        
	Anita recalled: All she used to say was, Do not worry. She used to laugh it off with a smile. She never spoke to anyone about her problem. She didnt want us to worry. We just wish she had come to us and given us a little indication.        
	Anita confirmed her sister was in an unhappy marriage and had separated a year ago from her husband of 11 years and started divorce proceedings recently. She was happy, really looking forward to getting on with her life and her two children and us. God knows where life would have taken her with her children.        
	Geetas mother commented that the family were very close and she regularly saw her daughter and grandsons at the weekend. The police have carried out numerous investigations but they need people who have seen or heard anything to come forward to help our daughter Geeta get justice. We are mourning and distraught that we have lost such a beautiful and caring person in our lives. She was cruelly taken away, leaving two gorgeous little boys who are without their mummy.        
	She said she constantly expected the phone to ring with her daughter on the line asking to be picked up. I just want her back. I expect her to call and I am still waiting for her to call.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Short people ordered to stand behind Sarko
                                                                                                               Short people ordered to stand behind Sarko

	Paris, Sept. 7: Twenty short people were ordered to stand behind Nicolas Sarkozy so as to make him look taller while delivering a keynote televised speech, it has emerged.        
	They were bused in after being vetted by aides of the French President who made sure none was taller than his own height of 5 feet 5 inches.        
	The extraordinary scenes unfolded at the Faurecia motor technology plant in Caligny, south of Caen, Normandy, last Thursday. Sarkozy looked far more statuesque than usual as he posed in front of the large group of white coated technicians on a stage.        
	In scenes being broadcast across France today, a woman researcher admits on camera that she was chosen because of her small size.        
	Asked by a TV journalist if it was necessary for her to be no taller than the Presidents 5 feet 5 inches  a height which rises to around 5 feet 7 inches thanks to his trademark stacked heels  she clearly replies: There you have it.        
	Pictures are then shown of the 20 workers on board a coach which brought them in from other parts of the three mile square Faurecia site. All admitted that they were among the smallest members of the 1400-strong Faurecia workforce, and had been selected to replace the usual workers in the unit where Sarkozy made his speech about the car industry.        
	Sarkozy, who is notoriously sensitive about his height, did not want a repeat of the fiasco in June when he was caught using a footstool when delivering a speech alongside British Premier Gordon Brown and President Barack Obama on one of Normandys nearby D-Day beaches.

	London, July 14: Daniel Radcliffe, star of the Harry Potter films, says his love life is far from magical as he cannot find a girlfriend.         
	Radcliffe, who is 20 next week, has thousands of adoring female fans around the world but is single. He told the Mirror newspaper: You know, Im not really doing the dating thing, I dont feel like Im in the world of dating. I dont feel like a young 20-something.         
	Im happy working but its not a case of I dont have time for a girlfriend. I do. Its just like everyone else whos single I suppose. In his new film, Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince, Radcliffe kisses Ginny Weasley, played by Bonnie Wright.         
	He said: I saw the film a couple of nights ago and my lips are like the lips of a horse, kind of distending away from my face, trying to encompass the lower half of hers.

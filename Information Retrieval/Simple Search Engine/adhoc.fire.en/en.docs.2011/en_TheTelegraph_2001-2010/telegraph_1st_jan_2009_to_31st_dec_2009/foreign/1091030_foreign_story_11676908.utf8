The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Failure to nab Qaida puzzles Hillary
                                                                                                               Failure to nab Qaida puzzles Hillary
                              Clinton at the Badshahi Mosque in Lahore on Thursday. (AFP)                            
	Lahore, Oct. 29 (Reuters): US secretary of state Hillary Clinton said today it was hard to believe that no one in Pakistans government knew where al Qaida leaders were hiding.        
	Clintons statement struck a new tone on a trip where Washingtons credibility has come under attack.        
	Scores of al Qaida leaders and their operatives, including Osama bin Laden, are believed to be in hiding in the rugged border territory that divides Pakistan and Afghanistan, but both countries routinely accuse the other of being the main sanctuary.        
	I find it hard to believe that nobody in your government knows where they are and couldnt get them if they really wanted to, she told a group of newspaper editors during a meeting in Lahore. Maybe they are not get-at-able. I dont know, she said.        
	Clintons pointed remark was the first public gripe on a trip aimed at turning around a US-Pakistan relationship under serious strain, but bound in the struggle against religious extremism. I am more than willing to hear every complaint about the United States, Clinton said,adding: But this is a two way street.        
	If we are going to have a mature partnership where we work together then there are issues that not just the United States but others have with your government and with your military security establishment.        
	Clinton, who has sought to use her own personal outreach to overcome rising anti-American sentiment in Pakistan, earlier repeated her conviction that the two countries common interests far outweighed their differences.        
	I am well aware that there is a trust deficit, Clinton told students at a townhall-style meeting at Government College University in Lahore.        
	My message is thats not the way it should be. We cannot let a minority of people in both countries determine our relationship.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Nepal bid to resolve army row
                                                                                                               Nepal bid to resolve army row
          J. HEMANTH                           General Rukmangat Katuwal                                  
	Kathmandu, April 28: Major Nepal parties today launched efforts to form a consensus to resolve the deadlock caused by the Maoists insistence that the Nepal Army chief be sacked.         
	Till late this evening, top Maoist and Communist Party of Nepal-Unified Marxist Leninist (CPN-UML) leaders held talks to find a way out of the crisis.         
	Among those who took part were Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal, alias Parchanda, and CPN(UML) chairman Jhalanath Khanal.         
	Earlier, Dahal met former Prime Minister and Nepali Congress president Girija Prasad Koirala at his residence.         
	The Prime Minister said he briefed Koirala about Army Chief Rukmangat Katuwals efforts to undermine the democratically elected government. Koirala agreed with my assessment of the situation and promised to look at the issue differently from now onwards, he said.         
	However, senior Nepali Congress leader Ramchandra Poudel, who was also present at the meeting, said Koirala asked Dahal not to sack Katuwal taking into account the critical situation in the country.

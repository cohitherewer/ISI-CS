The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Climate threat urgent: Obama

	New York, Sept. 22: President Obama called today for the worlds leaders to fashion a flexible and pragmatic response to the challenge of global warming by the end of 2009, saying if he and others fail to do so, we risk consigning future generations to an irreversible catastrophe.        
	Speaking at the UN climate summit in New York, Obama announced the start of a new era in the US, which had resisted mandatory curbs on greenhouse gas emissions during the Bush administration. He detailed the steps his administration has undertaken to curb Americas carbon footprint, including major investments in clean energy, new fuel economy standards for vehicles and House passage of a bill that would cap and trade global warming pollution.        
	These steps represent an historic recognition on behalf of the American people and their government, Obama said. We understand the gravity of the climate threat. We are determined to act. And we will meet our responsibility to future generations.        
	Obamas comments came as international leaders, including UN secretary-general Ban Ki-moon, declared the world has a moral and scientific obligation to reach a new global warming agreement in December, when years of climate talks will culminate at a meeting in Copenhagen.        
	Rajendra K. Pachauri, who chairs the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, took the podium just before Obama and detailed the threats human-generated greenhouse gas emissions pose to the planet: melting sea ice, severe drought and more intense tropical cyclones, to name a few. Science leaves us with no excuse for inaction now, Pachauri said.        
	As a sign of the new US approach to climate change, Obama said Washington is about to begin tracking how much greenhouse gas pollution is being emitted throughout the country. According to several sources, the Environmental Protection Agency will publish a final rule establishing a greenhouse gas registry for entities that emit the equivalent of 25,000 tons of carbon dioxide a year.        
	Daniel J. Weiss, senior fellow and director of climate strategy at the think tank Center for American Progress, said the administrations move highlights both how the US is starting to grapple with global warming and how far it has to go.        
	The greenhouse gas registry will tell us which companies are emitting how much pollution, Weiss said. The world is watching the Senate to see if it will take the next step to require pollution reductions. Todays UN session makes it clear that the registry is a necessary but by no means sufficient action to reduce global warming.

	San Francisco, June 9: Apple offered its devoted fans their periodic supply of catnip yesterday with a new version of the iPhone, called the iPhone 3G S.        
	Apple announced some things that were characteristically Apple: more, better, faster features on its smartphones and computers. It also announced something that was not: lower prices.         
	The company said the third model of its hit phone, which looks physically identical to the last version but includes internal hardware and software improvements, will go on sale on June 19. Among the changes, the iPhone 3G S will have a three-megapixel camera that also records video, an internal digital compass and voice-control features that let owners use spoken commands to make calls and play music.        
	The S stands for speed, and upgraded internal components will allow the device to run more than twice as fast as the previous model, according to Philip W. Schiller, Apples senior vice-president for worldwide product marketing. Schiller delivered much of the keynote presentation at Apples annual Worldwide Developers Conference, a meeting of Apple software makers that will last till Friday.         
	Steven P. Jobs, Apples chief executive, was not present. Jobs is on a six-month medical leave and is not expected to return until later this month.         
	The iPhone 3G S, which will be available in both black and white, is priced at $199 for the 16-GB version and $299 for the 32-GB version. A spokesman for AT amp;T, Apples exclusive iPhone partner in the US, said that for now, it would not change the monthly prices on its iPhone voice and data plans. Apple also announced it would sell the previous 8-GB iPhone 3G for a price of $99, reduced from $199, on top of data and voice plans. That could make the iPhone accessible to cost-conscious consumers.

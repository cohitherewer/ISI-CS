The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Han Chinese top riot toll
                                                                                                               Han Chinese top riot toll
                            
	Urumqi (China), July 11 (Reuters): China raised the death toll from ethnic rioting in Xinjiang, giving for the first time the ethnicity of the dead.        
	The official Xinhua news agency said 184 people had died in the July 5 riots in Urumqi, the Xinjiang regional capital, and 137 of those killed were Han Chinese, who form the majority of Chinas 1.3 billion population. The previous death toll was 156.        
	The latest figure included 46 Uighurs, the largely Muslim people of Xinjiang who share cultural bonds with Central Asian peoples. All but one were men. Uighurs, once a sizeable majority in Xinjiang, now make up 46 per cent of its 21.3 million people, according to government statistics.        
	Xinhua said the other person killed in the attacks that erupted last weekend was a member of the Hui ethnic group, which is Muslim but culturally akin to Han Chinese.         
	The reaction on Urumqi streets to the official death toll reflected the deepening ethnic divide in Xinjiang, with Uighurs expressing disbelief in the number.        
	Thats the Han peoples number. We have our own number, said Akumjia, a Uighur resident, as he eyed security forces who had cordoned off a street where there was an outburst of protest near a mosque and then arrests yesterday. Maybe many, many more Uighurs died. The police were scared and lost control.         
	Close to where he stood, what appeared to be a spray of bullet holes could be seen on the glass front of a Bank of China office.

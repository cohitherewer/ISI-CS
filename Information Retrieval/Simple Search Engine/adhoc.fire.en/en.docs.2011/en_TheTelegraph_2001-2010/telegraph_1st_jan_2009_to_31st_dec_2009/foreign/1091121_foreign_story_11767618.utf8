	Kathmandu, Nov. 20 (PTI): Nepals deposed king Gyanendra has, for the first time, got a passport at the age of 64.        
	It comes more than a year after he became a commoner, a foreign ministry official said today.         
	We issue diplomatic passports to all former heads of state and heads of government. So it was normal to issue the former king with a diplomatic passport, the official said. Sources said the ministry received a formal request from the former monarch for the document.

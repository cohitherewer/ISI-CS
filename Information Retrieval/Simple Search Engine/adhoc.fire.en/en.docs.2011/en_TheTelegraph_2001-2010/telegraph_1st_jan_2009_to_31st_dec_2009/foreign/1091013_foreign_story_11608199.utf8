	London, Oct. 12 (Reuters): Michael Jacksons new single This Is It began streaming online and playing across the radio airwaves today, nearly four months after the king of pop died of a prescription drug overdose aged 50.        
	The track, which features backing vocals by Jacksons brothers, opens with a soft, soulful introduction and the lines: This is it, here I stand/Im the light of the world, I feel grand.        
	It will be available to buy as part of the two-disc album This Is It which hits the shelves internationally on October 26 and in North America on October 27 to coincide with the global release of the Jackson movie of the same name on October 28. A short collection of clips from the film were also featured on websites showing Jackson and backing dancers rehearsing their routines for comeback shows.

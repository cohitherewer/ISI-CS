	Dera Ismail Khan (Pakistan), July 8 (AP): Suspected US drones launched two missile attacks on Taliban targets in the South Waziristan tribal region today, killing at least 45 militants in the latest in a barrage of strikes close to the Afghan border, intelligence officials said.        
	The army said the top Taliban commander in another area of the northwest, the scenic Swat Valley, was wounded in a Pakistani airstrike. It gave no more details. South Waziristan lies close to the Afghan border and is the stronghold of Pakistani Taliban leader Baitullah Mehsud. Pakistans military is also bombing and firing mortars at insurgent targets in the region.        
	The first strike took place before dawn. A suspected US drone fired six missiles at a mountain-top training camp in the Karwan Manza area of South Waziristan, killing 10 militants. The nationalities and the identities of the slain men were not immediately known. Hours later, 20km to the east, missiles believed fired from a US drone hit four vehicles carrying Taliban militants, killing at least 35, including a key Taliban commander.

                                                                                                               Potter copy slur denied
                            
	London, June 16 (Reuters): Bloomsbury Publishing Plc yesterday denied allegations that author J.K. Rowling copied substantial parts of a book by another childrens author when she wrote Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire.        
	The book, published in 2000, was the fourth instalment of the hugely successful boy wizard Harry Potter series.        
	The allegations of plagiarism made today, Monday 15 June 2009, by the Estate of Adrian Jacobs are unfounded, unsubstantiated and untrue, said a statement from Bloomsbury, which publishes Harry Potter in Britain.

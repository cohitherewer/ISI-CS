	Los Angeles, Nov. 2 (PTI): Actor and director Mel Ginson has become an Octo-Dad after his girlfriend Oksana Grigorieva gave birth to a baby girl.         
	It is the eighth child for the 53-year-old actor who already has six sons and one daughter with estranged wife Robyn.        
	Grigorieva gave birth to the baby on Friday, a few weeks early but everything went well and the mom and daughter are doing just fine, a source said.        
	Grigorieva, who is already the mother of a 12-year-old son with James Bond actor Timothy Dalton, met Gibson after signing to his record label Icon.         
	The Braveheart star announced that he was romancing the Russia-born musician earlier this year after photos of the couple holidaying in Costa Rica were leaked leading his wife Robyn to file for divorce.         
	The Apocalypto director also proposed to marry Grigorieva.

	Washington, Jan. 19: President-elect Barack Obama made a surprise appearance yesterday when the Presidential Inaugural Committee was in the midst of a conference call with major donors, sharing a moment he had spent with his girls recently.        
	First, however, Obama thanked everyone for relinquishing their cash in such hard times to help fund his historic five-day celebration. He told everyone on the call to stay focused on havin some fun, making history.        
	According to a source who asked to remain anonymous, Obama lightened the mood by telling them about taking his daughters, Malia and Sasha, to the Lincoln Memorial one night this week. They looked at the statue, read the Gettysburg address inscribed on one wall and Lincolns second inaugural address inscribed on the other. According to the source, Obama said Sasha, who is 7 years old, stared at Lincolns second inaugural address and said: Looks long. She asked if her dads speech would be that long. To which Malia, 10, replied: First African-American President, better be good.        
	Obama advised the donors to stay bundled up tomorrow.

	London, Oct. 4: British undergraduates are almost three times more likely to make errors in their English than those from overseas, new research suggests.        
	A study of written work produced by final-year students revealed that, on an average, they had 52.2 punctuation, grammatical and spelling errors per paper compared with just 18.8 from the international students. Prof. Bernard Lamb, reader in genetics at Imperial College London, and president of the Queens English Society, who conducted the research, said: There were hundreds of cases of disagreement in number between subjects and verbs (such as male sterility are useful, fertility in most breeds have low heritability).        
	Wrong plurals  such as varietys, two theorys and the two hypothesis  were common, it added. Grammatical errors included done by my partner and I and a women.        
	Spelling errors included flourescence for fluorescence, alot for a lot, seperate for separate, yeild for yield, relevent for relevant, introduications for introductions and pail vains for pale veins. The work will be published in the societys journal, Quest, next month. On punctuation, the researchers said: Semicolons were often used to introduce lists. Very few students used colons. Some never used possessive apostrophes, and there were many apostrophes used in non-possessive plurals  the cows rectum and the harems of seals.

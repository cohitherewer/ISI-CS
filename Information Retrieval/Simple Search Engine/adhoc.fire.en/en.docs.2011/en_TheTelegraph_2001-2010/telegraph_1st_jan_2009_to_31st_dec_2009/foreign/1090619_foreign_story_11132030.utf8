	Jolie jolt    
	New York, June 18 (PTI): While most people would love to boast that they received a call from actress Angelina Jolie, designer Malcolm Harris twice hung up on the superstar as he was convinced the caller was a prankster.       
	Jolie recently telephoned Harris to order three outfits from his One Dress line to wear to an array of upcoming World Refugee Day events on Saturday. However, she was left baffled when he ignored her repeated requests, reports the New York Post tabloid.      
	The Wanted actress finally managed to convince the designer that she was the real Jolie. Harris, who was embarrassed about the whole incident, managed to say that he was flattered to get a call from the actress.

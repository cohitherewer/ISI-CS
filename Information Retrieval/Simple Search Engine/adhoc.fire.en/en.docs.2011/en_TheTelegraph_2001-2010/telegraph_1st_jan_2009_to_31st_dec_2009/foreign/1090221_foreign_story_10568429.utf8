	London, Feb. 20: A grid of streets on the seabed at one of the proposed locations of the lost city of Atlantis has been spotted on Google Ocean.         
	The network of criss-cross lines is 620 miles off the coast of north west Africa near the Canary Islands on the floor of the Atlantic Ocean. The perfect rectangle was noticed on the search giants underwater exploration tool by an aeronautical engineer who claims it looks like an aerial map of a city.

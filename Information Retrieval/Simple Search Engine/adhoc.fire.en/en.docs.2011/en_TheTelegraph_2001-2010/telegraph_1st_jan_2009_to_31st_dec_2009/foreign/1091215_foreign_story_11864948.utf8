The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Obama rates himself B+
                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      Obama rates himself B+
                            
	London, Dec. 14: President Barack Obama has awarded himself a B+ for his first 11 months in office, stressing in an interview with Oprah Winfrey that there was still much to be done.        
	A good solid B+, Obama said during an hour-long, intimate soft-focus ABC network Christmas at the White House special, when Winfrey asked what grade he would give himself.        
	Explaining why he would not give himself top marks, the President said his administration had inherited the biggest set of challenges of any President since Franklin Delano Roosevelt which they were still working on.        
	He had earned good points for helping to stabilise the economy, setting a path out of Iraq and restoring Americas international image, but the job was not yet finished.        
	B+ because of the things that are undone. Health care is not yet signed. If I get health care passed, we tip into A-, Obama said, his hair visibly greyer than when he took office on January 20. Winfrey was given an inside tour of the White House by First Lady Michelle Obama, wearing a knee-skimming simple plum dress. They inspected the decorations and trees adorning every nook and cranny of the nations most exclusive address, and which have taken most of the year to plan. Pride of place went to a huge Christmas tree in the Blue Room hung with more than 650 baubles collected from around the White House closets.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | US Internet ties 
                                                                                                               US Internet ties 
                            
	New York, Sept. 30 (AP): As Internet use expands worldwide, the US said today it will give other governments and the private sector a greater oversight role in an organisation whose decisions affect how computers relay traffic such as email.        
	The move comes after European regulators and other critics have said the US government could wield too much influence over a system used by hundreds of millions of people worldwide. Those critics have complained, among other things, about the slow rollout of Internet addresses in languages other than English. However, the US government stopped short today of cutting its ties completely with the Internet organisation, the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers, or Icann. The government agreed instead to establish advisory panels made up of government and private-sector representatives around the world.        
	The panels will review how well Icann decisions are made openly, reflect the public interest, ensure stability and promote competition for domain names, which are the monikers ending in .com and other suffixes. Icann decisions could influence what domain names are available, what languages they are in and how much they cost.

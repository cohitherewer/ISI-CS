The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Love at first sight? Spare 8.2 seconds
                                                                                                               Love at first sight? Spare 8.2 seconds
                            
	London, March 25: The time needed for a man to fall in love at first sight is 8.2 seconds, scientists claim.         
	 The longer a mans gaze rests on a woman when they meet for the first time, the more interested he is. If it lasts just four seconds, he may not be all that impressed. But if it breaks the 8.2-second barrier, he could already be in love they say.         
	 However, the same is not true for women. They let their eyes linger on men for the same length of time whether they find them attractive or not. Hidden cameras were used to secretly track the eye movements of 115 students as they spoke to actors and actresses. They were then asked to rate their conversation partners attractiveness.         
	The men looked into the eyes of actresses they considered beautiful for an average of 8.2 seconds, but that dropped to 4.5 seconds when gazing at those they rated less attractive, the journal of Sexual Behaviour reported. The researchers believe that men use eye contact to seek out fit and fertile mates. But women are more wary of attracting unwanted attention because of the risks of unwanted pregnancy and single parenthood.

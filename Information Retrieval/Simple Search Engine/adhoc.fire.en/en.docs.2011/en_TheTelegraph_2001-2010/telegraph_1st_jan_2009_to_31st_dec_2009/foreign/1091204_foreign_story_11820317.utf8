The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Obama Afghan plan worries Pak

	Islamabad, Dec. 3: President Obamas new strategy for combating Islamist insurgents in Afghanistan fell on sceptical ears yesterday in next-door Pakistan, a much larger, nuclear-armed state that Obama said was at the core of the plan and had even more at stake than Afghanistan.        
	Analysts and residents on both sides of the 1,600-mile border expressed concerns about Obamas plan to send 30,000 more troops into Afghanistan in an effort to quickly train local security forces and allow US troops to begin leaving by July 2011.        
	But officials in Pakistan, which is fighting its own Taliban insurgency, expressed particular concern about their role in the strategy, which calls on this country to step up its cooperation in the fight against terrorism in exchange for a pledge of a long-term partnership after the guns fall silent.        
	In a cautious statement, Pakistans foreign ministry said the government welcomed Obamas reaffirmation of partnership. At the same time, it stressed the need for clarity in the new US policy and said it wanted to ensure that there would be no adverse fallout on Pakistan.        
	The partnership with Pakistan is key if Washington is to succeed in a region that Obama said on Tuesday night remains an enduring threat to US security. Islamist insurgents, including members of al Qaida, have for years enjoyed a sanctuary in the lawless tribal regions of Pakistan long before the September 11, 2001, attacks. The countrys officials have been accused of favouring an unofficial two-track policy in which they pursue violent extremists who oppose the Pakistani state but ignore or even assist those whose targets are across the border.        
	Washington has now issued a sharp warning that that policy must end. For the first time, Obama was very categorical about these safe havens and sanctuaries. Its now going to be much more difficult for those in Pakistan who have been in a state of denial about it, analyst Ahmed Rashid told Dawn Television.        
	Obamas strategy presents the Pakistanis with two central problems. First, they fear a troop build-up next door will send a surge of Afghan guerrilla fighters into Pakistan, further inflaming the situation in a country that has confronted a growing tide of urban bombings and terrorist attacks in the past several months.        
	The Islamabad government also has come under conflicting political pressures. While the US wants the Pakistanis to eliminate al Qaida sanctuaries on their side of the border, security officials are focused on a military campaign against the Pakistani Taliban forces that are carrying out domestic attacks.        
	Our military and civilian leaders need to speak with one voice, so the Americans can see we mean business, said Imtiaz Gul, a political analyst. But we have to keep our own long-term interests in mind, while taking on the extremist groups that are of concern to them.         
	Osama not in Pak        
	Pakistan does not believe Osama bin Laden is sheltering within its borders, Prime Minister Yousaf Raza Gilani said today, staunchly defending his governments efforts to crack down on al Qaida militants.

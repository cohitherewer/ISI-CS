The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Lal Masjid cleric breathes fire
                                                                                                               Lal Masjid cleric breathes fire
          NASIR JAFFRY                               
	Islamabad, April 17: Thousands of people greeted the hardline Pakistani cleric, Maulana Abdul Aziz as he delivered his first sermon at the Lal Masjid a day after getting released on bail and asked Muslims to wage jihad for enforcement of Islamic system.         
	 Aziz, who had been captured while trying to flee wearing burqa during the eight-day military seige of the Red Mosque in July 2007 was released on bail Thursday on Supreme Court orders against surity bonds of 200,00 rupees.         
	 More than 4,000 people gathered at the mosque to say Friday prayers amid tight security arrangements with hundreds of policemen deployed in a radius of at least 1km both in uniform and plain clothes to avoid any untoward incident.         
	The only solution to our problems is enforcement of Islamic system, Aziz said amid cheerful slogans of Allah--Akbar, Al-jehad, we salute martyres of the Lal Masjid.         
	He vowed to continue struggle for implementation of Islamic system saying that it were sacrifices rendered by hundreds ot Red Mosque students and deputy leader of the mosque Abdul Rashid Ghazi that Sharia is being enforced in Swat valley and tribal regions.         
	 President Asif Ali Zardari signed a law early this week to enforce Sharia in the former ski resort, Swat valley, which has been wracked by violence since military operation on the Lal Masjid in July 2007 which killed more than 100 people including the firebrand speaker deputy cleric of the mosquw Ghazi.         
	 People loudly expressed their support to Azizs call to render sacrifices for religion and enforcement of Islamic system. Let me tell you all one thing very clearly that all our problems will be solved if we sincerely implement Islamic system.        
	 I want to make it clear to the government that we are peace-loving people and we do not believe in taking revenge, he said and added nobody should forget fate of those, who launched operation against unharmful people of the Red Mosque. They are no more in the government and people literally hate them.        
	 Former President Musharraf himself admitted that his decision to launch the operation was wrong, the cleric said, who diluted his speech to a considerable extend avoiding to hurl out any threat for suicide attacks or armed struggle for which he was known in the past.

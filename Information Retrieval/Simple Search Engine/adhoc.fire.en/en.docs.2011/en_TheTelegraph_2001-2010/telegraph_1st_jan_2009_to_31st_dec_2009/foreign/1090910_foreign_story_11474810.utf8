	Kunduz (Afghanistan), Sept. 9 (Reuters): Nato troops freed a kidnapped British reporter for the New York Times in northern Afghanistan today, but his Afghan colleague, a British soldier and at least one civilian were killed in the rescue.        
	New York Times reporters Stephen Farrell and Mohammad Sultan Munadi were abducted while attempting to visit the scene of a Nato air strike that killed scores of Afghans in the north of the country. In an account published on the newspapers website, Farrell said he was freed by commandos during the raid, but Munadi was shot dead in front of him while they tried to run to safety.

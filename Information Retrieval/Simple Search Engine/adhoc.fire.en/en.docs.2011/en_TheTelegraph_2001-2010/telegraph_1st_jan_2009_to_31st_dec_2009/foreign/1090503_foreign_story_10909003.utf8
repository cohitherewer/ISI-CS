The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Outrage after Iran executes woman
                                                                                                               Outrage after Iran executes woman
                            
	Tehran, May 2 (Reuters): Iran has executed a woman convicted of murdering her fathers cousin when she was 17, Iranian media reported today.        
	Human rights groups criticised Irans execution yesterday of 23-year-old Delara Darabi in the northern city of Rasht. Delara Darabi, a painter charged with murder, was executed on Friday morning in Rasht prison without her lawyer and family being informed of her execution, the daily Etemad reported today.        
	The Czech presidency of the EU strongly condemned the execution of Darabi and urged Iran to avoid juvenile executions. Such human rights violations erode the ground for understanding and mutual trust between Iran and the EU, the presidency said.        
	Etemad said Darabi had been in jail for five years and had initially confessed to the murder because she believed she would be pardoned as the crime was committed when she was a minor. Amnesty International is outraged at the execution of Delara Darabi, and particularly at the news that her lawyer was not informed about the execution.

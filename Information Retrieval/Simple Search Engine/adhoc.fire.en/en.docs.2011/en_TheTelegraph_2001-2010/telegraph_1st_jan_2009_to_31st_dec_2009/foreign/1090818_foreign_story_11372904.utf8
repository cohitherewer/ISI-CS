                                                                                                               Digest goes bankrupt
                            
	New York, Aug. 17 (AP): The publisher of Readers Digest, Americas most popular general interest magazine, said today it would seek bankrupcty protection from creditors amid declining circulation, an industry-wide advertising slump and large debts.        
	Readers Digest Association Inc. said it has reached an agreement with a majority of secured lenders to restructure its debt. The monthly magazine, founded in 1922, has been searching for a niche as the Internet upends the industrys traditional business models.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Morphine boosts spread of cancer
                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      Morphine boosts spread of cancer
                            
	Washington, Nov. 23 (PTI): Morphine, routinely prescribed as a pain reliever to cancer patients, makes it easier for cancer cells to invade other tissues and spread, US scientists claimed.        
	They also claimed to have found a drug which counters this effect without interfering with the pain-relieving properties of the opiate (morphine).        
	Laboratory tests suggest that morphine not only strengthened blood vessels but also appeared to make it easier for cancers to invade other tissues and spread, lead researcher Patrick Singleton told a meeting of American Association for Cancer Research in Boston. Methylnaltrexone or MNTX could help overcome this effect by the drug, Singleton said.        
	In mice with lung cancer, MNTX inhibited the apparent tumour-promoting effects of opiates and reduced the spread of cancer by 90 per cent, BBC reported.        
	If confirmed clinically, this could change how we do surgical anaesthesia for our cancer patients, said Singleton from University of Chicago. Laura Bell of Cancer Research in UK said research in this area is in the early stages, so its too early to tell whether opiate-based painkillers have an effect on cancer growth.

	Colombo, April 11 (Reuters): The nations leading Sri Lankas peace process today urged the Tamil Tigers to free 100,000 civilians they are holding and the military to stop shelling the no-fire zone where the separatists are making their last stand.        
	The statement from the US, Britain, Japan and Norway came as Sri Lankas military said it had begun what it called the largest hostage rescue operation in the world by identifying the best routes for people to get out.        
	The four-nation group, dubbed the Tokyo Co-Chairs, discussed on a conference call how to best end the futile fighting without further bloodshed, a US state department statement said.        
	They call on the Tamil Tigers to permit freedom of movement for the civilians in the area, it said.

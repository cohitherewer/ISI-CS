The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | AIG bonus blow to Obama
                                                                                                               AIG bonus blow to Obama
  - Fury over payout threatens to singe President        MICHAEL D. SHEAR AND PAUL KANE                                    
	Washington, March 17: President Obamas apparent inability to block executive bonuses at insurance giant AIG has dealt a sharp blow to his young administration and is threatening to derail both public and congressional support for his ambitious political agenda.         
	Politicians in both parties flocked to express outrage over $165 million in bonuses paid out to executives at the company, demanding answers from the President and swamping yesterdays rollout of his efforts to spark lending to small businesses.         
	The populist anger at the executives who ran their firms into the ground is increasingly blowing back on Obama, whom aides yesterday described as having little recourse in the face of legal contracts that guaranteed those bonuses.         
	White House press secretary Robert Gibbs, peppered with questions about why the President had not done more to block the bonuses at a company that has received $170 billion in taxpayer funds, struggled for an answer yesterday afternoon. He explained that government lawyers are looking through contracts to see what can be done to wrest these bonuses from their recipients. Obama himself sought to channel the publics sense of disbelief yesterday. How do they justify this outrage to the taxpayers who are keeping the company afloat? he said, declaring the bonuses an outrage.         
	White House aides grasped for actions that could soothe sentiment on Main Street and in the halls of Congress, where the fate of the new Presidents sweeping agendas on health care, climate change and education will be decided. They suggested that the government will use its latest pledged installment of $30 billion for the ailing company to recover the millions in bonuses paid on Friday.         
	But the damage control did not seem to satisfy incredulous lawmakers in both parties, who said the image of financial executives taking huge bonuses from a taxpayer-funded rescue puts the President in a politically impossible position.         
	I warned them this would be met with an unprecedented level of outrage, Senator Christopher J. Dodd, the chairman of the banking committee and part of a group of senators who pressed treasury secretary Timothy F. Geithner to stop the bonuses, said yesterday. House Minority Leader John A. Boehner said the bonus issue added to his belief that there will be almost no Republican support for any expansion of a bank-bailout programme.

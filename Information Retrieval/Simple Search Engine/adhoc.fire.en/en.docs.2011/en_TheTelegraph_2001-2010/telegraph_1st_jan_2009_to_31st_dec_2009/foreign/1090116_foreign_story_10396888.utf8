The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Charles not racist: Sooty
                                                                                                               Charles not racist: Sooty
          ANDREW PIERCE AND CHRISTOPHER LAMB                          Charles                                  
	London, Jan. 15: A British Asian businessman at the centre of a second race row involving the Royal Family in less than a week has dismissed the idea that the Prince of Wales is a racist for calling him Sooty.         
	 Kolin Dhillon, 58, a multi-millionaire property developer in Gloucestershire, was given the nickname when he joined Cirencester Park Polo Club in 1975.         
	The Daily Telegraphs Mandrake column disclosed that both the Prince and his two sons always referred to him as Sooty whenever they meet. That led to further criticism from anti-racism groups following the disclosure at the weekend that Prince Harry had once referred to a former army colleague as a Paki.         
	However, in a statement Dhillon insisted he regarded the Sooty nickname as a term of affection.         
	I have to say, you know you have arrived when you acquire a nickname! he said. I enjoy being called Sooty by my friends who I am sure universally use the name as a term of affection with no offence meant or felt.        
	The Prince of Wales is a man of zero prejudice and both of his sons have always been most respectful.                     THE DAILY TELEGRAPH

	Cocoa ability    
	 London, April 3: Eating chocolate could improve the brains ability to do maths, a new study suggests, reports The Daily Telegraph.       
	Mental arithmetic became easier after volunteers had been given large amounts of compounds found in chocolate, called flavanols, in a hot cocoa drink. They were also less likely to feel tired or mentally drained, the findings, presented at the British Psychological Society annual conference in Brighton show.       
	David Kennedy, director of the brain, performance and nutrition research centre at Northumbria University, said that chocolate could be beneficial for mentally challenging tasks. The findings suggest students who binge on chocolate when revising for exams may gain a real benefit from doing so.      
	For the study, 30 volunteers were asked to count backwards in groups of three from a random number between 800 and 999 generated by a computer. The findings show that they could do the calculations more quickly after they had been given the drink.

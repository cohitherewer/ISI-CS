The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Twin hits on govt kill 136 in Baghdad
                                                                                                               Twin hits on govt kill 136 in Baghdad
                            
	Baghdad, Oct. 25 (AP): Two powerful suicide car bombs blew up outside the justice ministry and city government offices in downtown Baghdad today, killing at least 136 people in the worst attack in more than two years.         
	Iraqi leaders said the attacks aimed to disrupt political progress in the months leading up to Januarys crucial elections.        
	The bombings, that also injured nearly 600 people, underscored the insurgencys ability to still pull off devastating attacks in the centre of what is supposed to be one of Baghdads most secure areas.        
	The street where the blasts occurred had just been reopened to vehicular traffic a few months ago when blast walls were repositioned to allow traffic closer to the government buildings.         
	The perpetrators of these treacherous and despicable acts are no longer hiding their objective but to the contrary, they publicly declare that they are targeting the state... and aiming at blocking the political process, halting it and destroying what we have achieved in the last six years, President Jalal Talabani said.        
	There have been no claims of responsibility so far, but massive car bombs have been the hallmark of the Sunni insurgents seeking to overthrow the countrys Shia-dominated government.        
	Black smoke billowed from the frantic scene, as emergency service vehicles sped to the area. Even civilian cars were being commandeered to transport the wounded to hospitals.        
	The walls collapsed and we had to run out, said Yasmeen Afdhal, 24, an employee of the Baghdad provincial administration, which was targeted by one of the car bombs. There are many wounded. I saw them being taken away. They were pulling victims out of the rubble, and rushing them to ambulances.        
	At least 25 staff members of the Baghdad Provincial Council, which runs the city, were killed in the bombing, said council member Mohammed al-Rubaiey.        
	The area where the blasts occurred is just a few hundred yards from the Green Zone that houses the US embassy as well as Prime Minister Nouri al-Malikis offices.

	London, March 10: Music fans will no longer be able to watch their favourite videos on YouTube after Google blocked viewings during a dispute over licensing.         
	Google started to block Britishviewers from watching premium music videos from tonight but said it will take several days until all professional music videos are covered by the restriction. The internet giant described it as a painful decision which it knew would cause significant disappointment.        
	PRS for Music licenses Google to make music videos available to UK viewers on YouTube. However, the firms are currently negotiating a new licensing deal.         
	The collection society which issues licences and collects royalties on behalf of copyright holders, said Google wants to pay significantly less than at present to the writers of the music.

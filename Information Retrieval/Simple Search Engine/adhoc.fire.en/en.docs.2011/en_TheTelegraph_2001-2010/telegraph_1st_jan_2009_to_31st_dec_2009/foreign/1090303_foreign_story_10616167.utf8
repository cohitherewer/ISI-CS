The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Sharif spurns Zardari olive branch
                                                                                                               Sharif spurns Zardari olive branch
                              Sharif in Lahore. (AP)                            
	Islamabad, March 2 (PTI): Former Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif and his brother Shahbaz have ruled out any reconciliation with President Asif Ali Zardari till the Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) chief gives up his powers to dissolve parliament and reinstates judges dismissed during the 2007 emergency.        
	The brothers decision is a setback to the Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam chief Maulana Fazlur Rehman and ANP leader Asfandyar Wali Khan who were trying to mediate a patch-up between Zardari and Sharif.        
	Addressing a lawyers gathering at Bahawalpur, former Punjab chief minister Shahbaz Sharif said there could be no reconciliation with Zardari till he repealed the 17th constitutional amendment, which gives the President sweeping powers to dissolve parliament, and reinstates judges removed by former military ruler Pervez Musharraf.        
	Shahbaz made the comments after a meeting with Zardaris representative and Baluchistan chief minister Aslam Raisani.        
	Sharif accused Zardari of continuing Musharrafs policies and failing to keep his promises he made to the electorate during the last elections. Has the Constitution or any law or judge or internal and external policy been changed after Musharrafs resignation? If this is how it was to be, Musharraf could have remained too. I feel as if Musharrafs spirit has entered Zardari sahab, he said.        
	Addressing a news conference with Jamaat-e-Islami chief Qazi Hussein Ahmed in Lahore, Sharif warned that such shrewdness and deceit would backfire on the PPP and weaken the government.        
	These are defining moments and all the people will have to rise for the future of the country, said Sharif. He vowed to take the movement against the Zardari government, spearheaded by the Pakistan Muslim League (Nawaz), to its logical conclusion.        
	Sharif said the Presidents actions are aimed at protecting the National Reconciliation Ordinance, a controversial law passed by Musharraf to scrap graft cases against Zardari and other PPP leaders. This is Zardaris personal agenda. I have now reached the conclusion that because of this agenda, the national agenda could not be implemented.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Tiger boss death buzz as rebels silence guns
                                                                                                               Tiger boss death buzz as rebels silence guns

	Colombo, May 17 (Agencies): The LTTE today conceded defeat but the announcement was overshadowed by the discovery of a body that triggered speculation on the fate of Tiger chief V. Prabhakaran.        
	News agencies earlier quoted military sources as saying the body was believed to be that of Prabhakaran and the identity was being confirmed.        
	However, the government later denied reports of the LTTE leaders death. We do not have any reports of Prabhakarans death and such reports are not true, minister for mass media and information, Lakshman Yapa Abeywardena, told PTI. Prabhakaran had vowed never to be taken alive.        
	President Mahinda Rajapaksa is expected to make a televised address on Tuesday to give an update on the war.        
	A military official said the security forces were taking the body for checks to confirm if it is the real Prabhakaran. Four other military sources confirmed the recovery and said identity checks were under way.         
	Military spokesperson Brigadier Udaya Nanayakkara denied that.        
	Rumours flew yesterday that Prabhakaran had died or fled the country, but LTTE sources said he was sheltered in a reinforced bunker.        
	One theory doing the rounds in Colombo was that the 55-year-old Prabhakaran blew himself up along with his top lieutenants on Friday night in thick jungles so as to ensure his body would not be found by the Lankan army.        
	As the rumours flew, the LTTE said it had decided to silence our guns to deny the army an excuse to kill civilians.        
	A pro-rebel website, Tamilnet, released a statement from the LTTEs head of international relations saying: This battle has reached its bitter end.        
	We remain with one last choice  to remove the last weak excuse of the enemy for killing our people. We have decided to silence our guns, Selvarajah Pathmanathans statement said. Our only regrets are for the lives lost and that we could not hold out for longer, Pathmanathan added.        
	He said 3,000 people lay dead and 25,000 more were wounded.        
	In an interview to Britains Channel 4 from an undisclosed location, Pathmanathan said he had spoken to Prabhakaran for four hours. He said the LTTE boss had ordered him to tell the Sri Lankan government and the international community the Tigers were ready for a ceasefire.        
	The government rejected the ceasefire call, saying there was no longer any reason to stop the battle as the military had already freed all civilians trapped in the war zone by midday today.         
	The military said a total of 72,000 had fled since Thursday.        
	Suicide fighters blew themselves up on the frontline today morning, and more than 70 were killed trying to flee overnight, the military said. Unconfirmed reports said about 300 LTTE cadres committed mass suicide last night after troops zeroed in on them.        
	By afternoon, the military said fighting had slowed.

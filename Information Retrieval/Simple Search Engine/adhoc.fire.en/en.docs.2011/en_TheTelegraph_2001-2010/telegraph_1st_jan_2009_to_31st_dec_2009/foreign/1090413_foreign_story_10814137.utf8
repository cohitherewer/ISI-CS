                                                                                                               Two-day ceasefire   in Lanka
                                  
	Colombo, April 12 (Agencies): The Sri Lankan President today ordered the military not to attack the Tamil Tigers during a two-day holiday in order to allow thousands of civilians to escape a no-fire zone where they are being held by the separatists.        
	The state-run Sunday Observer newspaper has reported that LTTE chief Velupillai Prabhakaran has apparently agreed to a rescue mission by a western country to evacuate the civilians.         
	Prabhakaran has apparently agreed to a rescue mission by a western country. He has agreed to this offer after he lost all his top level leaders in the Puthukudiyiruppu battle as there is no point for him to operate there in the no-fire zone without the ability to give leadership to the remaining cadres, the Sunday Observer reported, citing diplomatic sources.        
	President Mahinda Rajapaksa said people should be given uninhibited freedom of movement from the no-fire zone in the Sinhala and Tamil New Year period on Monday and Tuesday.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Obama vow to rebuild on day of reckoning

	Washington, Feb. 25: President Barack Obama urged America yesterday to see the economic crisis as reason to raise its ambitions, calling for new efforts to address energy, health care and education even as he warned that government bailouts have not come to an end.        
	In his first address to a joint session of Congress, Obama mixed an acknowledgment of the depth of the economic problems with a Reaganesque exhortation to American resilience. He offered an expansive agenda followed by a pledge to begin paring an ever-climbing budget deficit.        
	While our economy may be weakened and our confidence shaken, though we are living through difficult and uncertain times, tonight I want every American to know this, Obama said. We will rebuild, we will recover, and the United States of America will emerge stronger than before.         
	After eight years under President George W. Bush, Americans tuned in yesterday night to a scene that put the new Democratic cast front and centre. Obama was preceded into the House chamber by his cabinet, including secretary of state Hillary Rodham Clinton, whom he kissed as he made his way to the speakers dais.         
	Even several Republicans leaned in close to Obama as he walked down the aisle.        
	He set up his push for a wide-ranging overhaul of domestic policy by lamenting what he said were decades of unwillingness on the part of society and government to make tough decisions or put long-term gain ahead of short-term benefit. In the process, he took a thinly veiled swipe at his predecessor for his tax cuts and philosophy of deregulation.         
	That day of reckoning has arrived, Obama said, and the time to take charge of our future is here.        
	As he spoke for nearly an hour in a prime-time address, Obama compared the moment facing America to challenges the country has weathered before. He reminded Americans that Abraham Lincoln, Franklin D. Roosevelt and other Presidents had found promise amid peril, which he said should serve as a guide for today.         
	His words were often stern, but laced with optimism and humour as he said neither political party was free of blame for the nations condition. He urged Americans to believe in his ability to steer the country through its fiscal emergency.         
	While he did not break new ground on the policies he proposed, he framed his argument with fresh urgency.        
	Pretense and pride fell by the wayside and the President reported to the nation that things have skidded wildly off course. Then Obama sought to convince an angry, anxious America that a moment of crisis is actually a time for expanding aspirations, not shrinking horizons.        
	The young new President projected a voice of generational confidence to a public that by one measure is less confident than at any other time since Obama was in school. He invested his popularity behind a plan that he said would not only restart the engine of our prosperity but also transform the country with bold action and big ideas.        
	As he tried to navigate the divide between hope and realism, the vision he articulated was in some ways anything but unifying.         
	His ideas for raising taxes on the wealthy, revamping the health care system and reversing climate change represent a philosophical agenda that strikes at the heart of the Republican Partys core beliefs. While he said he did not believe in bigger government, he proposed a more activist government than any other since Lyndon B. Johnson.

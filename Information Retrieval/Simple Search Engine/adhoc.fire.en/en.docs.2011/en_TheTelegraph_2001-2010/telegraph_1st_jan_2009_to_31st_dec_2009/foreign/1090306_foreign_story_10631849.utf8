The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Screen Che meets real Chavez
                                                                                                               Screen Che meets real Chavez
                            
	Caracas (Venezuela), March 5 (AP): Socialist President Hugo Chavez met a 21st-century incarnation of one of the worlds biggest revolutionary icons yesterday: actor Benicio del Toro, who stars in the new film chronicling the life of Ernesto Che Guevara.        
	Del Toro met Chavez during a visit in which he also was mobbed by adoring fans and attended a screening of Steven Soderberghs two-part, four-and-a-half-hour film biography Che. The Puerto Rican-born, Oscar-winning actor said he sought the lead role in Che because he wanted to be part of a totally Latin American movie.        
	Del Toro did not speak in detail about his meeting with Chavez, but said he had a good time with the President. Hes nice, the actor told journalists.

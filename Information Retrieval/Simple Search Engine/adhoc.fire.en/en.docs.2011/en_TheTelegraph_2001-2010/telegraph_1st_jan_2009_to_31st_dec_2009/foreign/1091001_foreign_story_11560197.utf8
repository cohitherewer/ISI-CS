	Baikonur (Kazakhstan), Sept. 30: A Canadian circus tycoon, an American astronaut and a Russian cosmonaut blasted off in a spacecraft from the Kazakh steppe today on a journey to the International Space Station.        
	Minutes after lifting off from the Baikonur launch facility, the Soyuz capsule shed its rocket stages and entered orbit. On board were Cirque du Soleil founder and space tourist Guy Laliberte along with crew members Jeffrey Williams and Maxim Surayev.        
	Friends and family on the ground cheered and hugged one another when an announcement that the ship was in orbit came over the loudspeaker. They chanted Guy! Guy! and broke out singing Elton Johns Rocket Man.        
	Laliberte, dubbed the first clown in space, had donned a bulbous red nose and blew kisses to supporters before the launch. He has paid $35 million for the trip he plans to use to publicise the worlds growing shortage of clean water.        
	Im very happy for him. Its amazing, said Lalibertes partner, former model Claudia Barilla, tears streaming down her face as she cradled her young son in her arms. Now we know hes up there.

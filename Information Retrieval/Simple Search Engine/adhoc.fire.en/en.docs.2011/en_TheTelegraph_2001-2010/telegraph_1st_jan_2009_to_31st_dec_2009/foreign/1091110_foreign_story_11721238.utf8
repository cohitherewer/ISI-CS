                              Rihanna: It was ugly                            
	Los Angeles, Nov. 9 (Reuters): R amp;B singer Rihanna broke her silence on Friday about the night her ex-boyfriend Chris Brown attacked her, saying he had bitten her, put her in a headlock and left her bleeding and swollen.        
	It wasnt the same person that says I love you. It was not those...eyes, Rihanna, 21, told Diane Sawyer in an interview on ABC televisions Good Morning America show.        
	He had... no soul in his eyes. Just blank... He was clearly blacked out. There was no person when I looked at him, she said.        
	Brown, 20, singer of hits like Kiss, Kiss, was sentenced to five years probation and 180 hours of community service for the assault in February on the eve of the Grammy Awards. He has apologised publicly and although the pair briefly reunited, Rihanna said she now has no desire at all to be with him.        
	Rihanna said the attacks started with an argument over a text message Brown received while they were driving home from an industry party. I couldnt take it that he kept lying to me. And he couldnt take it that I wouldnt drop it. And... it was ugly, she told Sawyer.        
	Rihanna acknowledged police reports that Brown bit her, put her in a head lock until she had trouble breathing, and punched her several times in the eye. I fended him off with my feet... but it was not like, it was not like a fight with each other. I just... I really just wanted it to stop, she said. Her screams prompted a passerby to call the police.        
	I was bleeding, I was swollen in the face, she said. So there was no way of me getting home, except for, my next option was to get out of the car and walk. Start walking in a gown, in a bloody face. So I really dont know what my plan was. Rihanna said although her wounds had long healed, she had flashbacks and scars inside.        
	The thing that men dont realise when they hit a woman, its... the face, the broken arm, the black eye, its going to heal. Thats not the problem. Its the scar inside.        
	You flashback... you... you remember all the time. It comes back to you whether you like it or not, she said.

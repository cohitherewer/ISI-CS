The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Troops face fire on new rebel turf
                                                                                                               Troops face fire on new rebel turf
                            
	Peshawar, April 23 (AP): Pakistani paramilitary forces rushing to protect government buildings and bridges in a Taliban-infiltrated district just 96km from the capital were met with gunfire today that killed one police officer, authorities said.        
	It was not immediately clear if the gunmen were Taliban militants.        
	Six Frontier Constabulary platoons arrived yesterday in Buner, a district with more than a half-million residents, said Syed Mohammed Javed, a government official who oversees the area covered by the peace deal. He would not say if the deployment was in direct response to the Taliban presence. Javed did not specify the number of troops involved, but a platoon typically has 30 to 50 members.

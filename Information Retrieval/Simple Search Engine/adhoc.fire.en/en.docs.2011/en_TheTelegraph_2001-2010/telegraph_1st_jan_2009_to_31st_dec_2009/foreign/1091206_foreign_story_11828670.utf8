The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | First Asian UK judge admits road crash killing
                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      First Asian UK judge admits road crash killing
          PAUL STOKES                              
	London, Dec. 5: Britains first Asian woman magistrate is to be removed from the bench after admitting killing another woman in a road crash.        
	 Shan Alexander, 66, wept as she pleaded guilty to causing death by careless driving when she appeared before Macclesfield magistrates.        
	She pulled out of a T-junction in her Mercedes car into the path of another vehicle, killing her rear seat passenger Mallory Perry, also 66.        
	The tragedy happened while Alexander was taking a party of blind and partially-sighted people and their carers for a Rotary Club day out to a stately home in Cheshire in May.        
	Beverley Dobson, prosecuting, said Alexanders was the third car in a convoy when she pulled out in front of a Peugeot which was unable to avoid her car. She told the court: As a result of that Mrs Perry lost her life. We say this was not a momentary lapse, but a deliberate act based on a miscalculation.        
	Perry was not wearing a seatbelt. Her husband Brian, 65, who is blind and was also a passenger, and Alexander were treated for shock.        
	Alexander, from Marple, Cheshire, told police: I looked right and there were no cars on the right side, then I saw the white car in the distance.        
	I judged that the distance was enough that I could get across to the other side. I drove steadily across to the other side and I thought I had finished the manoeuvre when I heard this bang.        
	Alexander, who was born in Sri Lanka, is chairman of Stockport magistrates bench where she has served for over 20 years. She is a former mayor of Stockport.

	Harry flunks    
	 London, Feb. 15 (PTI): Prince Harry has failed to clear his first flying test, the News of the World tabloid has reported.       
	The 24-year-old has flunked the theory-based flying test at a Royal Air Force base in Lincolnshire, only a few months into the two-year course.       
	Harry didnt reach the grade but he will have plenty of other opportunities to pass it. He will now be given extra tuition. It wasnt a case of Harry failing and being booted off the course. Its part of an ongoing assessment, a RAF source was quoted by the British tabloid as saying.       
	Harry, an army lieutenant, is currently on an attachment to the Army Air Corps for his flying training.    
	Flying thief     
	 Budapest (Reuters): A notorious 83-year-old Hungarian thief with a criminal record dating back six decades, was caught by police recently. Kosztor Sandorne, dubbed Flying Gizi by the Hungarian media, was arrested after she entered a house in Komarom, a town in the northwest. Sandorne, who earned her nickname because she liked to flee her crime scenes by taking commercial flights, said she was in the house because she wanted to find a cheaper lodging than in Budapest.

	Spelling horror    
	 London, Feb. 9: Americans are worse at spelling than Britons, with more than half unable to spell embarrassed, liaison and millennium, reports The Daily Telegraph.       
	Despite the popularity of school spelling bee competitions, adults in the US fared poorly in a survey comparing how English speakers on both sides of the Atlantic deal with commonly misspelt words.      
	Sixty-two per cent of Americans got embarrassed wrong, against 54 per cent of Britons who struggled with the word in a survey last year. Adults in the US performed less well on most of the ten words tested, including millennium (52 per cent wrong, against 43 per cent in UK), liaison (61 per cent to 54 per cent) and accommodation (42 per cent to 36 per cent).       
	Only definitely and friend were spelt correctly by more Americans.    
	Rock titans    
	 Berlin (Reuters): Metallica frontman James Hetfield is out to recreate some of the magic of the 1988 US Monsters of Rock tour in Europe this year, with a seven-date sweep of the region ending at Knebworth in England. One of the worlds most successful bands Metallica is spearheading a European version called Sonisphere.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Red Cross warns of Pak crisis

	Paris, May 7: With their possessions piled on pickup trucks or escaping on foot, thousands of people were reported to be fleeing the conflict in Pakistans Swat Valley today as the International Committee of the Red Cross said that up to half a million people may have been uprooted by the fighting.        
	In a televised address in Islamabad, Pakistan Prime Minister Yousaf Raza Gilani said the army had been called out to eliminate militants fully. He said more troops have been ordered to battle Taliban forces in Swat.        
	The international body, based in Geneva, also said the conflict between government forces and Taliban militants had severed its access to places where civilians most needed help and that a humanitarian crisis was worsening.        
	The Red Cross warning coincided with news reports from the region today saying the government had intensified strikes with helicopter gunships and warplanes. The reports could not be verified in part because reporters are barred from the area. The authorities said yesterday that at least 35 militants had been killed.        
	Under pressure from the US, Pakistan has said its forces are trying to turn back an encroachment by Taliban militants that has brought the insurgents to within 96km of Islamabad.         
	The fighting was focused on the areas of Dir, Buner and Swat, where a ceasefire between government forces and militants has apparently collapsed. The governments reports of action against the Taliban coincided with a visit to Washington by Pakistans President Asif Ali Zardari who met President Obama yesterday.        
	Reuters reported that thousands of people took advantage of a break in a curfew today to escape as government aircraft strafed Taliban positions. Last February the authorities struck a contentious truce with the Taliban, effectively handing the militants control of the region.        
	News reports today said casualties included the son of a radical cleric, Maulana Sufi Muhammad, who helped broker the truce. A spokesman for the cleric was quoted in news reports as saying his son died when artillery shells hit his house in Dir district, adjoining Swat.        
	Reuters quoted Swats administrator, Khushal Khan, as saying the authorities were helping people to flee after a curfew was eased. He also said convoys of troops were moving into the region. The Associated Press reported that Taliban militants had set up roadblocks to prevent residents from fleeing the Swat Valley, whose main settlement, Mingora, is under Taliban control.

                                                                                                               Police kill 2 Uighurs in Urumqi
                            
	Urumqi, July 13 (AP): Police shot dead two Uighur men and wounded a third today on the streets of Urumqi, where tens of thousands of troops are stationed to restore calm a week after deadly ethnic riots raged in the western Chinese city.        
	 Police said the three men attacked them when they tried to pull them off a fourth Uighur, whom they had attacked with knives and rods. A government official in Urumqi who described the attack would give only his surname, Fan.        
	Though many members of the Uighur minority have accused security forces of using heavy-handed tactics in the wake of the riots, todays shooting was the first time officials have said police opened fire.        
	The police fired into the air as a warning, but that did not stop the attack. The police then shot them according to law, Fan said. He said the wounded man was taken to a hospital.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Obamas worst habit? He wins all the time
                                                                                                               Obamas worst habit? He wins all the time

	Burbank (California), Oct. 24 (AP): What is President Barack Obamas most annoying habit?        
	Practising his speeches for hours in front of the bathroom mirror? Talking too much foreign policy at the dinner table?        
	No. First Lady Michelle Obama said yesterday its his tennis game. When they play, the President usually wins.        
	He beats me quite often, she said on NBCs The Jay Leno Show, appearing via satellite hook-up from the White House. That gets to be pretty annoying.        
	In a brief skit, Leno pushed her to talk about her husbands flaws. At first, she sarcastically said he has none. Hes perfect, she quipped.        
	Then she let it out: Its their battles on the tennis court that get her peeved.        
	It also looks like Bo  the Obamas dog  is living like a king. The First Lady said the presidential pooch celebrated his first birthday earlier this month with a Rose Garden party.        
	Bo, a Portuguese water dog, feasted on a cake shaped like a dog house that was made out of veal.        
	We had a really sweet celebration, Michelle Obama told Leno.         
	She told Leno there are White House secrets she will never reveal  she refused to divulge what daughters Malia and Sasha are wearing for Halloween. You need security clearance for that, she said.        
	Leno also wanted to know what she whispers to her husband after his speeches. I usually ask him did he take out the garbage, she said.

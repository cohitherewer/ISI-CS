	London, June 25: A crack addict who stalked wealthy women in some of Londons most affluent areas before robbing them was warned that he faced life in prison yesterday.         
	Daniel Mykoo, 28, looked for victims in areas such as Hampstead, St Johns Wood and Chelsea, sometimes using his brother, Matthew, 27, to help him as they tried to feed their 12,000-a-month drug habit. He attacked the women from behind and throttled them as his brother ripped off their earrings, necklaces and watches.         
	Nicole Farhi, the fashion designer, was one of his victims. She had a Rolex watch of sentimental value stolen when she was attacked at knifepoint on her doorstep in April last year. BBC presenter Sangeeta Mhaiskar was attacked outside her home in north London by Daniel Mykoo last March.

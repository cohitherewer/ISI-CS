	London, Aug. 12: Smiling and recalling something pleasant from the previous day help to make you happier, according to a new experiment.        
	Volunteers who were asked to recall a pleasant event from the previous day were given an immediate 15 per cent boost in happiness. Other techniques that helped to increase happiness included expressing gratitude, smiling and carrying out an act of kindness.        
	Those in another group carried out a control technique that simply involved thinking about the previous day. The research found that 65 per cent of those recalling something happy had a boost in happiness, compared to only half of those who just thought about the days events.        
	An act of kindness led to a nine per cent boost in happiness, while being grateful for an aspect of life led to an eight per cent rise and making an effort to smile and hold it made people six per cent happier.        
	Prof. Richard Wiseman, from the University of Hertfordshire, conducted a mass-participation experiment online, with more than 26,000 people joining to try recognised mood-boosting techniques. The happiness experiment was set up in an attempt to send cheerfulness across Britain. Together with a nationwide publicity campaign, it was hoped the experiment might make Britain a happier place.

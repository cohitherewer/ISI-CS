                                                                                                               Actor who played Dr No dead
                              Wiseman                            
	London, Oct. 21: Joseph Wiseman, the actor who played the sinister scientist and title character of Dr No in the first James Bond film, has died in New York aged 91.        
	His daughter, Martha Graham Wiseman, said her father had been in declining health before his death at his home in Manhattan on Monday.        
	A screen and stage actor, Wisemans film credits include Detective Story and The Unforgiven. He also had guest roles on the television shows Law amp; Order, The Streets of San Francisco, The Twilight Zone and The Untouchables.        
	 He is likely best known, however, for his villainous role in Dr. No. The 1962 film introduced Sean Connery as James Bond.

                                                                                                               Rushdie gets lady his size
                            
	London, Sept. 7 (PTI): Salman Rushdie is rarely seen out without a striking woman towering over him but the writer finally stepped out with a woman of his own stature, albeit a married one.        
	Rushdie made an appearance at the Venice Film Festival with Canadian-born former model Carolann Javicoli, reports the Daily Mail. The pair did not leave each others side during the party. But the authors spokesperson denied a romance.

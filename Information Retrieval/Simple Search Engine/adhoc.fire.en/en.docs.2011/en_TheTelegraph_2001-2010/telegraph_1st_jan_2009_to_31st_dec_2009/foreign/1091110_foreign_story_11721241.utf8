	Hot Eva stopper    
	 New York, Nov. 9 (PTI): Actress Eva Mendess new traffic-stopping billboard ad has angered some residents in New York, while others find it incredibly sexy.       
	Calvin Kleins latest underwear ad shows the Hitch star, dressed only in skimpy lingerie, sprawled on a bed with a male model, reports the New York Daily News.      
	The billboard spans an entire block in Soho and has split Manhattanites between admirers and angry residents who have dubbed it pornography. But there are others who are definitely pleased with the new ad and are looking forward to buy the product.     
	Star edge    
	 London (PTI): Pop superstar Madonna has once again fuelled rumours that she is set to marry her toyboy lover Jesus Luz as she is planning to fly to Brazil to meet his parents. Her friends said that Madonna, 51, is slightly on edge as Luzs mother Cristiane Regina da Silva is 15 years her junior. But they added that Madonnas meeting Luzs family is a sign that an engagement could be on the cards. Madonna really does love and need Jesus and she does not hold all the power in their relationship.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Obama traces Lincoln route
                                                                                                               Obama traces Lincoln route
                            
	Philadelphia, Jan. 17 (AP): President-elect Barack Obama, tracing the train route Abraham Lincoln took nearly a century and a half earlier, undertook the final leg of his inaugural journey to the US capital today, pledging to reclaim Americas spirit but also warning of steep challenges facing the country.        
	Starting now, lets take up in our own lives the work of perfecting our union, he told several hundred invited guests gathered inside a hall at Philadelphias historic 30th Street train station before his trip to Washington where he will be inaugurated on Tuesday as the first African-American US President.         
	Lets build a government that is responsible to the people and accept our own responsibilities as citizens to hold our government accountable... Lets make sure this election is not the end of what we do to change America, but the beginning and the hope for the future. During the slowmoving Amtrak railway journey towards central Washington, which will be sealed off like a fortress, Obamas carriage will pass through three states where chemical, biological and radiological sensors have been placed along the way. The sensors have even been put in the Delaware river.         
	In Washington 42,500 members of the Secret Service, police, National Guard, military personnel and other security officials will be swarming throughout the city next week, during an operation that has even taken lessons from the recent terror attacks in Mumbai. The President-elects day started in Philadelphia with a sober discussion of the countrys future with 41 people he met during his long quest for the White House. At the outset, he told a crowd gathered in a flag-draped room that the same perseverance and idealism displayed by the nations founders are needed to tackle the difficulties of today.

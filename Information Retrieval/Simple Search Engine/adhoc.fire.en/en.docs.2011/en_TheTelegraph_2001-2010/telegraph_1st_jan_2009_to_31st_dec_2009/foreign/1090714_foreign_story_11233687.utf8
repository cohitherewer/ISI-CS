The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Refugees from Swat start going back home
                                                                                                               Refugees from Swat start going back home

	Islamabad, July 13: Hundreds who fled a military offensive against the Taliban in the Swat Valley, a fraction of those displaced, began trickling back home today after the Pakistani government announced the first stage of a three-phase plan to return them.        
	Elsewhere, at least nine people, including seven children, were killed when a blast ripped through a house in a farming village in the southern part of Punjab Province, police officials said.         
	Nearly two million refugees have been displaced by the fighting in Swat, which began after a February peace deal that had handed the Taliban effective control of the district collapsed, and a military campaign to uproot the militants began. The refugees, tens of thousands of whom have spent months in government camps, are eager to return home, but many have expressed trepidation about their safety.        
	In the first phase of the return, government-provided buses and trucks began shuttling hundreds of families to Swat today from three camps in the Mardan and Charsadda districts south of Swat.        
	Mohammad Shumon Alam, the spokesman in Pakistan for the aid agency Oxfam, said many families were sending one or two members as scouts to check the area and their homes before loading all members, including children, into vehicles to go back. Many families were confused about the details of the return, such as whether they were eligible for assistance after they left, Mr. Alam said, and as a result, fewer people were returning.

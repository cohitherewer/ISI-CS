	London, Oct. 14 (AP): A historian says Benito Mussolini was well paid as a British agent during World War I.        
	The Guardian newspaper reported today that Peter Martland of Cambridge University discovered that Mussolini was paid 100 a week by Britain in 1917  equal to about 6,000 today.        
	The late Samuel Hoare, in charge of British agents in Rome at that time, revealed in his memoirs 55 years go that Mussolini was a paid agent.

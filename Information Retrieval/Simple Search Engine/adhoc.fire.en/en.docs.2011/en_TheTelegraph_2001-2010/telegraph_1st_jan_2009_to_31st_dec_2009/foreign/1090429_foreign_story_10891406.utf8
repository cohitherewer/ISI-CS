	Mayer special    
	 Los Angeles, April 28 (PTI): Singer John Mayer, the former boyfriend of actress Jennifer Aniston, has denied reports that he is dating a 24-year-old cocktail waitress.       
	The Grammy-winning singer split with Friends star Aniston earlier this month and recent media reports suggested that he was romancing actress Scheana Marie.      
	But Mayer insists that there is no special someone in his life at the moment, website www.aceshowbiz.com reported. If I had a girlfriend, she would be incredibly offended by me saying: I dont have a girlfriend.

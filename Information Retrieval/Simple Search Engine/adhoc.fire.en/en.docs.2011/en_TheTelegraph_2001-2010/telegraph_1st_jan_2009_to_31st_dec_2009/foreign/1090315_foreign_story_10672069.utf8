The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Robin Hood not so good
                                                                                                               Robin Hood not so good
                              Costner as Robin Hood in Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves                            
	London, March 14 (AP): A British academic says he has found proof that Britains legendary outlaw Robin Hood wasnt as popular with the poor as folklore suggests.        
	Julian Luxford says a newly found note in the margins of an ancient history book contains rare criticism of the supposedly benevolent bandit. According to legend, Hood roamed 13th-century Britain from a base in central Englands Sherwood Forest, plundering from the rich to give to the poor.        
	But Luxford, an art history lecturer at the University of St Andrews, in Fife, Scotland, says a 23-word inscription in a history book, written in Latin by a medieval monk around 1460, casts the outlaw as a persistent thief.        
	Around this time, according to popular opinion, a certain outlaw named Robin Hood, with his accomplices, infested Sherwood and other law-abiding areas of England with continuous robberies, the note read when translated into English, Luxford said.        
	Luxford said he found the entry while searching through the library of Englands prestigious Eton College, which was founded in 1440 by King Henry VI.        
	 The new find contains a uniquely negative assessment of the outlaw, and provides rare evidence for monastic attitudes towards him, Luxford said about his find issued yesterday. He said the note about Hood  uncovered in the margin of the Polychronicon, a history book which dates from the late 1340s  may be the earliest written reference to the outlaw.        
	First mentions of Hood, depicted in Hollywood movies by both Kevin Costner and Errol Flynn, are commonly believed to have been in late 13th-century ballads. Some academics claim the stories refer to several different medieval outlaws, while others believe the tales are pure fantasy.

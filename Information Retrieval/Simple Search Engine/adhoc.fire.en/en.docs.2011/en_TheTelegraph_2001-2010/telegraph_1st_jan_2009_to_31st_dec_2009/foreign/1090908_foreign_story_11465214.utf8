	Scarlett fright    
	 London, Sept. 7 (PTI): Actress Scarlett Johansson may have recorded two albums but she has no plans to sing before live audiences because she has a terrible stage fright.      
	The Vicky Christina Barcelona star has confessed that she has never sung before a huge crowd because she suffers from stage fright.      
	I have terrible stage fright. Ive never had to sing in front of a live audience, other than some backup vocals. It seems incredibly revealing, very different from making a red carpet appearance, where the glitz and glamour of movie stardom can mask any sort of insecurity, she said in an interview to Black Book magazine.      
	Johansson has recorded a new album with musician Pete Yorn called Break Up and fears that the success will lead to a series of live shows she would rather not think about.

	Sears balcony    
	 London, July 3: The Sears Tower in Chicago, the tallest skyscraper in the western hemisphere, is offering visitors a new way to push their fear of heights right over the edge, reports The Daily Telegraph.      
	A set of glass balconies, nicknamed The Ledge and suspended from the buildings 103rd floor Skydeck, opened yesterday.      
	The glass is three layers thick, one-and-a half inches in total, and capable of holding five tons. But it doesnt make them any less scary.      
	At first I was kind of afraid but I got used to it, said Adam Kane, 10, a visitor from Alton, Illinois, as clouds drifted past. Look at all those tiny things that are usually huge.    
	UK find     
	 London: A rare and extremely valuable copy of the United States Declaration of Independence has been discovered in Britain, reports The Daily Telegraph. The document, which is in perfect condition, is believed to be one of only 200 ever printed and was found among files at the National in Kew in Richmond, Surrey. Stumbled upon by an American antiquarian bookseller carrying out research, the Dunlap print of the declaration was printed on July 4, 1776, and brings the total of known surviving copies worldwide to 26.       
	This manuscript was hidden among correspondence from American colonists that had been intercepted by the British in the 18th century.    
	Clean feat    
	 London: A patient was so disgusted at the filthy hospital ward she was being treated in that she forced herself out of bed and cleaned it while still attached to a drip, reports The Daily Telegraph. Tereza Tosbell, 48, who works as a cleaner, became angry as she watched hygiene staff at work and claimed their brief visit left the room as dirty as they found it. So she tracked down cleaning materials and attacked the sink, radiator and curtain rail she said had not been wiped by the official cleaners in Colchester General Hospital.    
	Pet hunt    
	 London: A vet who paid for 20,000 leaflets to be printed after a customers beloved cat was lost has now brought in sniffer dogs to track down the missing animal, reports The Daily Telegraph. Jodie Dawkins took her pet Lionel to the Honeybourne Veterinary Centre in Gloucestershire, with a dislocated hip after he was hit by a car. But the cat escaped two and a half weeks ago when a duty nurse took him home and put him in her garden shed with his cage unlocked. Practice partner Paul Adkin paid for 20,000 fliers with Lionels picture on them. Now he has gone a step further and drafted sniffer dogs in to the hunt.

                                                                                                               Saeed poser from Pak
  - Interpol alert for suspects                            Hafiz Mohammed Saeed                                  
	Islamabad, Aug. 6 (Agencies): Pakistan today said the evidence provided by India was not enough to prosecute alleged 26/11 mastermind Hafiz Mohammed Saeed, but appeared to hand Manmohan Singh a concession by taking an administrative step in the hunt for some of the accused.        
	On Islamabads request, international police Interpol today issued a global alert for 13 suspects in the Mumbai attacks, including operatives of the Lashkar-e-Toiba, which Saeed founded and headed.        
	It needs to be underlined that the dossiers and information received from India (on) Saeed are not really enough... to proceed legally as is being expected, foreign office spokesperson Abdul Basit said.        
	Saeeds case has been indefinitely adjourned following the resignation of a key government counsel, appointed under provisions introduced by former President Pervez Musharraf that the Pakistani Supreme Court declared illegal last week.        
	Interpol asked its 186 member countries to help locate the 13 fugitives and notify the organisation with any investigative leads. If the fugitives are located, Pakistani authorities will formally request provisional arrest with a view towards extradition, the Interpol statement said, indicating that most of the suspects were not in Pakistan.        
	The 13 have been declared proclaimed offenders by a Pakistani anti-terror court.        
	Interpol did not name the suspects but a dossier handed over by Pakistan to India gives the names of 13 absconding suspects.         
	They are Lashkar operatives Mohammad Amjad Khan and Iftikhar Ali; Shahid Ghafoor, captain of the boats used by the attackers; and crew members Abdul Rehman, Md Usman, Ateeq-ur-Rehman, Riaz Ahmad, Md Mushtaq, Md Naeem, Abdul Shakoor, Md Sabir Salfi and Shakil Ahmad.

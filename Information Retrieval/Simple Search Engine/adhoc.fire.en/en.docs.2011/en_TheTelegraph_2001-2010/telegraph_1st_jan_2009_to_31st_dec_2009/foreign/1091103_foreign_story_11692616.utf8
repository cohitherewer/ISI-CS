          ELISABETH ROSENTHAL                                          Dangerous habit        
	Oxford, Nov. 2: Inside the imposing British Crown Court here, Phillipa Curtis, 22, and her parents cried as she was remanded for 21 months to a high-security womens prison, for killing someone much like herself.         
	The victim was Victoria McBryde, an up-and-coming university-trained fashion designer.        
	Curtis had plowed her Peugeot into the rear end of McBrydes neon yellow Fiat, which had broken down on the A40 Motorway, killing McBryde, 24, instantly.        
	The crash might once have been written off as a tragic accident. Curtiss alcohol level was zero. But her phone, which had flown onto the road and was handed to the police by a witness, told a story that under new British sentencing guidelines  would send its owner to jail.        
	In the hour before the crash, she had exchanged nearly two dozen messages with at least five friends, most concerning her encounter with a celebrity singer she had served at the restaurant where she worked.        
	They are filled with the mangled spellings and abbreviations that typify the new lingua franca of the young. LOL did you sing to her? a friend asks. Curtis replies by typing in an expletive and adding, I sang the wrong song. A last incoming message, never opened, came in seconds before the accident.        
	With that as evidence, Curtis was sentenced in February under 2008 British government directives that regard prolonged texting as a serious aggravating factor in death by dangerous driving  just like drinking  and generally recommend four to seven years in prison.        
	The case reveals the tensions that arise when law enforcement and the courts begin to crack down on a dangerous habit that has become widespread and socially acceptable. Is texting while driving bad judgment, or a heinous crime? And what is the appropriate punishment?        
	Upon hearing the sentence, prosecutors  backed by the police and McBrydes mother  quickly appealed to Britains highest court for a longer prison term, calling 21 months unduly lenient.        
	She came across as a lovely young girl, and Im sure it wasnt a nice feeling for the judge to send someone like this to prison  but someone is dead because of a text message, said Bill Sykes, the officer who responded to the crash and led the subsequent investigation.        
	But many young people, among them the dead womans own siblings and friends, disagreed, sympathising also with Phillipa Curtis. I think Phillipas sentence was long enough, as she seemed like such a normal girl, said Gemma Pancoust, the victims cousin and close friend, with whom she liked to sing karaoke to Dolly Partons 9 to 5.        
	 Until Torys death I texted while driving, as have most people. I dont think she realised the danger she was causing.        
	Indeed, the victim herself had sent a text message and talked on her mobilephone (using the speaker function) while driving before her car broke down, according to the testimony of a friend with whom she had the 20-minute phone conversation. It is illegal in Britain to use a hand-held phone while driving, and drivers using hands-free phones may be fined if they are deemed not in control of the vehicle.        
	Although most European countries and a minority of American states now ban the use of hand-held mobile phones while driving, Britain has become one of the more aggressive countries in attacking the problem, according to Ellen Townsend, policy director for the European Transit Safety Council, which advises the European Commission.        
	Britains new guidelines state that using a hand-held phone when causing a death will always make the offense more serious in terms of punishment and lead to prison time. Texting is given special treatment.

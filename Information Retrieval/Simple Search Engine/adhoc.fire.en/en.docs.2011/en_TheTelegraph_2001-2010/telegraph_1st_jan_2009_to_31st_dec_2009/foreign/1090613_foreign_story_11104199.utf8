	Lahore, June 12 (Reuters): A prominent anti-Taliban Muslim cleric who condemned suicide bombings was killed today in a suicide attack in Lahore, police said.        
	Moderate cleric Sarfraz Naeemi was attacked at his office at his mosque complex after leading Friday prayers. Three persons including Naeemi were killed and 11 wounded, top city administrator Sajjad Bhutta said.        
	The young attacker posed as a religious student and avoided police checks at the main gate of Naeemis complex. He came through a small door that opens onto a side alley and entered the office in the guise of a disciple.

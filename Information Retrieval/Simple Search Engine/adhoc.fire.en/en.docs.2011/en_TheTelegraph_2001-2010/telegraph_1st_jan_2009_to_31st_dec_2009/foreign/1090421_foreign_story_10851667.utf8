The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Thousands flee Tiger hub
                                                                                                               Thousands flee Tiger hub
  - Largest hostage rescue in history, says Rajapaksa                            Thousands flee an area controlled by the Tamil Tigers in northeastern Sri Lanka on Monday. (Reuters)                                  
	Colombo, April 20 (AP): A thick line of thousands of Sri Lankan civilians  with only a handful of belongings among them  streamed out of the last sliver of land held by the rebels today.         
	Video footage provided by the air force showed some fleeing to a nearby beach and others heading to a military-controlled area.        
	President Mahinda Rajapaksa called the exodus the largest-ever hostage rescue mission in history. In a televised speech, he said the military had made the escape possible by opening up several new routes from the Tamil Tigers last holdout.        
	But a pro-rebel website said hundreds of civilians were feared killed in the total chaos that prevailed when the soldiers entered the zone.        
	It is not possible to verify any of the claims because the war zone is restricted to journalists. Footage given to AP Television News by the air force showed an orderly exit.                  Prabhakaran: Boxed in.      
	Military spokesman Brigadier Udaya Nanayakkara said soldiers advanced into the zone and seized a fortification built by the rebels before rescuing the civilians. The move came as the government warned the rebels it would launch a final assault in 24 hours and urged the rebels to surrender before noon tomorrow. It also comes just days after the military imposed a unilateral two-day ceasefire to encourage civilians to flee.        
	Only a few hundred left at that time, prompting the government to renew accusations that the rebels are holding civilians against their will to use as human shields.        
	The charge has also been levied by aid groups, though the rebels have denied it. It was not possible to contact the rebels for comment.        
	The UN says an estimated 100,000 civilians are trapped in the a war zone measuring only 20 squarekm. The UN also estimates that some 4,500 non-combatants have been killed in the last three months amid fierce fighting.        
	Footage shot by APTN showed men, women and small children resting on a beach in Pthumathalan, on the northeastern coast, after fleeing the war zone. The vast majority of those who fled today  more than 25,000  headed instead to a military-controlled area where they were being screened.        
	The UN and others have called for a negotiated cease-fire to allow the civilians to leave. The government has rejected such calls, saying its on the verge of crushing the 25-year insurgency.        
	The government said today that rebel leader Velupillai Prabhakaran and his fighters have 24 hours to surrender before a final assault  one of many such promises that troops will soon end the conflict. Defence spokesman Keheliya Rambukwella said the governments preferred option is to catch Prabhakaran alive and said the ultimatum was a final opportunity for the leader to end the conflict.        
	The rebels have refused previous calls for their surrender. Rambukwella said the rebel leaders capture or death has now become inevitable because he will soon lose his civilian cover.        
	He (Prabhakaran) doesnt have that option now, Rambukwella

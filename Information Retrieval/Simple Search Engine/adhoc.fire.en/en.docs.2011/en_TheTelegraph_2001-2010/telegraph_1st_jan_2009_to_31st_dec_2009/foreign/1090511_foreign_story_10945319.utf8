                                                                                                               Bid to evacuate Swat
                            
	Kota, May 10 (Reuters): Pakistans military ordered people out of parts of the Swat valley today, temporarily relaxing a curfew to enable civilians to flee an intensifying offensive against Taliban militants.        
	The army said it had killed 400 to 500 militants in Swat and the neighbouring Shangla district in the past 24 hours.         
	About 200,000 people have left Swat in recent days and in all about 500,000 are expected to flee.         
	Everybody wants to get out of this hell, Zubair Khan, a resident of Mingora, the valleys main town, said.         
	Some are driving out while many are just on foot. They dont know where theyre heading but staying here just means death.        
	The army went on a full-scale offensive on Thursday after the government ordered troops to flush out militants from the Taliban stronghold.        
	The offensive was launched while President Asif Ali Zardari was in Washington assuring the US his government was committed to fighting militancy.        
	US Army general David Petraeus today said Pakistans offensive against the Taliban in the Swat valley had galvanised the countrys political leaders, people and the military to fight an existential threat.        
	Helicopters and warplanes targeted militant hideouts in Mingora and other areas in Swat and Shangla today, the military said. Two soldiers had died, it said.         
	The army ordered civilians out of four districts to clear the way for attacks on militants and lifted a curfew for nine hours from 6am local time.         
	Residents said transport was scarce because the army was not letting vehicles into the valley.

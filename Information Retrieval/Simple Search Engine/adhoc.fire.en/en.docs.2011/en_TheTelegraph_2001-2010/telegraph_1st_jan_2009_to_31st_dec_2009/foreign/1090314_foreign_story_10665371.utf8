The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Drone deaths
                                                                                                               Drone deaths
                            
	Peshawar, March 13 (Reuters): Taliban militants recovered 24 bodies and were searching for more today, hours after suspected US drones destroyed a camp in Pakistans northwestern region, militants and officials said.        
	Four missiles believed to have been fired by at least two pilotless US drone aircraft last evening hit a militant hideout and training camp in the Kurram tribal region on the Afghan border. Soon after the attack a villager in the Barjo area said 14 people had been killed but an intelligence official and a Taliban official said today the toll had gone up as militants sifted through the rubble of the seven-room training compound.        
	Weve so far found 24 bodies in the debris and were still looking, a Taliban official in the ethnic Pashtun region said by telephone. He declined to be identified.        
	Pakistani security agents and the militant official said there were no senior militants, or high value targets among the dead. The Taliban official said those killed were Pakistani and Afghan. US drones have carried out more than 30 strikes since early 2008 when the US, frustrated by an intensifying insurgency in Afghanistan getting support from the Pakistani side of the border, began attacking with greater frequency.        
	Eliminating militant support from the lawless northwestern Pakistani enclaves is seen as essential for winning the war in Afghanistan. There has been no let-up in the strikes since the administration led by President Barack Obama took over in January, with six strikes since then.

	Khartoum, Aug. 4 (AP): Sudanese police fired tear gas and beat women protesting outside a Sudanese court today during the trial of a female journalist accused of violating the Islamic dress code by wearing trousers in public.        
	After the hearing, Lubna Hussein, a former UN worker, said: I am not afraid of flogging. ... Its not about flogging. Its not about my innocence. Its about changing the law.         
	The journalist said she would take the issue all the way to Sudans constitutional court if necessary, but that if the court rules against her and orders the flogging, she was ready to receive (even) 40,000 lashes.        
	Police moved in swiftly and dispersed about 50 protesters, mostly women, who were supporting Hussein, who faces 40 lashes on the charge of indecent dressing. Some of the women demonstrators wore trousers in solidarity with Hussein while others wore more traditional dress.        
	While the police broke up the demonstration outside the court, the judge adjourned Husseins trial for a month to seek clarification from Sudans foreign ministry.        
	Trousers are considered indecent under the strict interpretation of Islamic law, adopted by Sudans Islamic regime which came to power after a coup led by President Omar al-Bashir in 1989. But activists and lawyers say the implementation of the law is arbitrary.        
	Hussein was among 13 women arrested on July 3 in a raid by the public order police on a popular cafe in Khartoum. Ten of the women were flogged at a police station two days later and fined 250 Sudanese pounds, or about $120.

	Witch on hunt    
	 Vilnius (Lithuania), Jan. 15 (AP): In these difficult times for creditors, a Lithuanian debt collector is offering an unconventional service to retrieve arrears: witchcraft.      
	The Vilnius-based firm has hired Vilija Lobaciuviene, the Baltic nations most famous self-styled witch, to hunt down companies and individuals who are failing to pay their debts amid the credit crunch.      
	Lobaciuviene, who describes herself as Lithuanias leading witch, is renowned in the former Soviet republic of 3.4 million people for providing such magical services as predicting the future and casting spells. She claims to use hypnosis, herbal medicines and the bio-energy field when helping her patients.

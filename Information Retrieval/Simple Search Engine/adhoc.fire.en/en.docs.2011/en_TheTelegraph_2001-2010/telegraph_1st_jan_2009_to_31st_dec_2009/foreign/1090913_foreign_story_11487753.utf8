                                                                                                               Wave of attacks hit Afghanistan
                            
	Kabul, Sept. 12 (Reuters): Roadside bombs, gunbattles and a suicide strike killed five Americans and dozens of Afghan civilians, troops and police, officials said today.        
	Attacks took place in all corners of the country, not only in southern and eastern areas that have long been violent but also in the north and west, which had been comparatively quiet until recent weeks.        
	In the worst incident reported today, the interior ministry said a roadside bomb in Uruzgan province in the south had struck two passenger cars, killing 14 civilians.        
	In Kunduz province in the north, fighters attacked a police post, killing seven policemen including the commander at the checkpoint in a battle that ran from the middle of the night into morning. Two other police were missing, feared captured.

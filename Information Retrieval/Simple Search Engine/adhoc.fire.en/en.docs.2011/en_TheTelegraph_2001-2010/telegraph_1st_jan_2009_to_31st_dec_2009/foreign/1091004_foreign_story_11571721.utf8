The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Worldwide Pants down, a dilemma for CBS
                                                                                                               Worldwide Pants down, a dilemma for CBS
          BILL CARTER AND BRIAN STELTER                            (From top) David Letterman and alleged blackmailer Robert Joel Halderman                                
	New York, Oct. 3: If this happened to anyone else, it would just be a punch line.         
	David Letterman, who built his career skewering philandering politicians and show business weasels and boneheads, finds himself in the middle of his own celebrity scandal, after he admitted having multiple affairs with employees of his production company, Worldwide Pants.         
	For the intensely private Letterman, the revelations, which resulted from a bizarre extortion attempt, are sure to be extremely embarrassing, especially as he tries to extend his lead in the late-night contest. I have had sex with women who work for me on this show, he told his audience on Thursday night, calling himself creepy. He added that he hoped to protect my job.         
	More seriously, they raised questions for both his company and broadcaster CBS about whether his actions constituted sexual harassment or at least abuse of a power relationship over employees.         
	A central figure in the case  one of the women who did have a sexual relationship with Letterman, according to representatives of the show  was Lettermans long-time personal assistant, Stephanie Birkitt, who also often appeared on air. The sexual relationships had ended before Letterman got married in March, a Worldwide Pants executive said.         
	For CBS, the episode is doubly embarrassing. The network has been put in a precarious position of trying to steer clear of fallout from some highly questionable activities engaged in by its biggest star, who is experiencing his biggest surge in popularity (and ratings) in years.        
	At the same time, the man accused in the case, Robert Joel Halderman, who until last month shared a residence in Connecticut with Birkitt, is a well-respected producer for a CBS News programme.        
	Halderman, 51, pleaded not guilty to one count of attempted larceny, after he reportedly threatened to expose Letterman. According to prosecutors, Halderman gave Letterman, 62, a screenplay treatment depicting the talk-show host as a great success whose world is about to collapse around him with revelations of his trysts. Halderman also handed over photographs, correspondence and a page of the personal diary of Birkitt.         
	Haldermans personal life has been plagued by problems. A bitter divorce in 2004 left him with a $6,800 monthly alimony payment.         
	In private, CBS executives have told the Worldwide Pants executives that they continue to be supportive of Letterman. But they have included a note of caution, saying that would change only if information of a more damning nature were to emerge.        
	Representatives of Lettermans company said he should have raised during his confession on Thursdays show that his affairs with his employees had all taken place before he married his long-time girlfriend, Regina Lasko.        
	A Worldwide Pants spokesperson said its policy does not prohibit relationships within the company  only that they cannot be tied to an employees performance.        
	Several associates of Letterman said he had a long history of pursuing relationships with employees, dating to his first days on television on NBC in the early 1980s. At that time he was known to frequently date interns and other young women connected to his show, one associate said.        
	His first long-time relationship was with Merrill Markoe, who was his head writer on his NBC show, Late Night With David Letterman, and before they became a couple, Letterman and Lasko worked together on his show.         
	Beyond any potential legal trouble, there is the open question about how fans will receive Letterman, who has long used his stance as a sarcastic comic commentator to ridicule the behaviour of politicians and celebrities.         
	Today, The LA Times accused Arnold Schwarzenegger of groping six women, he once said in a monologue. Im telling you, this guy is presidential material.         
	The audience seemed to respond on Thursday night: The Late Show ratings increased about 20 per cent over his average.                    NEW YORK TIMES NEWS SERVICE

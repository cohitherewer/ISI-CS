	Dhaka, Dec. 3 (PTI): The Bangladesh government has charged former Prime Minister Khaleda Zias sons over the ferry capsize last week that killed 84 people.        
	The three-decker vessel, M.V. Coco-4, capsized in a river in coastal Bhola district on Friday night with about 1,500 people on board, almost three times more than its registered capacity.        
	Zias sons, Tarique Rahman and Arafat Rahman Coco, are the managing director and director of Rahman Shippers, the company that owns M.V. Coco-4. They have been charged with their partner Giasuddin Al Mamun, who is also a director.         
	Shipping minister Shahjahan Khan said the government would also punish government officials if they were involved in the capsize.

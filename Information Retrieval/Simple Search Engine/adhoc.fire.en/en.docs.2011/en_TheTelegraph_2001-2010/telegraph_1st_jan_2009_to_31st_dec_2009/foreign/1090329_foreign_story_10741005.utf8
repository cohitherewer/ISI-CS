The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Debate led Obama to new Afghan plan
                                                                                                               Debate led Obama to new Afghan plan
          HELENE COOPER AND ERIC SCHMITT                          Obama, Biden: Key strategy                                  
	Washington, March 28: President Obamas plan to widen US involvement in Afghanistan came after an internal debate in which Vice-President Joseph R. Biden Jr. warned against getting into a political and military quagmire, while military advisers argued that the Afghanistan war effort could be imperiled without even more troops.        
	The Presidents advisers agreed that the primary goal in the region should be narrow  taking aim at al Qaida, as opposed to the vast attempt at nation-building the Bush administration had sought in Iraq. The question was how to get there.        
	The commanders in the field wanted a firmer and long-term commitment of more combat troops beyond the 17,000 that Obama had already promised to send, and a pledge that billions of dollars would be found to significantly expand the number of Afghan security forces.         
	Defence secretary Robert M. Gates and Admiral Mike Mullen, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, pressed for an additional 4,000 troops to be sent to Afghanistan  but only to serve as trainers. They tempered the commanders request and agreed to put off any decision to order more combat troops to Afghanistan until the end of this year, when the strategys progress could be assessed.         
	During these discussions, Biden was the voice of caution, reminding the group members that they would have to sell their plans to a sceptical Congress.         
	This article is based on interviews with half a dozen officials who were involved in the debate. All requested anonymity because they were discussing meetings that involved classified material and the shaping of policy.Obama left a final White House meeting in the Situation Room last Friday signalling to participants that he was close to a decision, but that he wanted to get comfortable with what he was going to do. He mulled the issue while at the Camp David retreat over the weekend. On Wednesday, he told his top aides that he had made up his mind.        
	In announcing a plan yesterday that could be his signature foreign policy effort, Obama said that he would send more troops  some 4,000  but stipulated that they would not carry out combat missions, and would instead be used to train the Afghan Army and the national police.         
	He left himself open to the possibility of sending more as the situation warrants.         
	The debate over the past few weeks offered a glimpse into how Obama makes decisions. In this case, he chose a compromise between his political and military advisers that some critics say includes some strategic holes, such as a reliance on the same sort of vague guidelines that proved difficult to carry out in Iraq.         
	It also offers insight into the role of Biden and other members of a foreign policy team that includes many powerful figures vying for Obamas attention.         
	In the end the plan is a compromise that reflected all the strains of the discussion among his advisers, one that is markedly different, though perhaps no less difficult, from the goals his predecessor set for the region.         
	In speaking of Afghanistan and Iraq, President Bush spoke of lofty goals that included building nations that could stand as models of democracy in the Muslim world.

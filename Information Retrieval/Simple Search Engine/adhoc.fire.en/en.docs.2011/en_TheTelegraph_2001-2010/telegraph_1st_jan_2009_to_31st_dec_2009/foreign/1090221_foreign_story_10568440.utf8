The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | NY Post sorry for cartoon
                                                                                                               NY Post sorry for cartoon
                            
	New York, Feb. 20 (Reuters): The New York Post apologised yesterday to those offended by an editorial cartoon that critics said was racist because it likened President Barack Obama to a chimpanzee.        
	The newspaper acknowledged that the cartoon published on Wednesday had drawn controversy because African-Americans and others saw it as a depiction of Obama.        
	This most certainly was not its intent; to those who were offended by the image, we apologise, the paper said in an editorial on its website headlined That Cartoon. It was meant to mock an ineptly written federal stimulus bill. Period, the paper said.        
	The cartoon of a policeman shooting an ape played on the real shooting of a pet chimpanzee in Connecticut this week. A police officer in the cartoon says: Theyll have to find someone else to write the next stimulus bill.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Stars line up for Obama
                                                                                                               Stars line up for Obama
                                  
	New York, Jan. 13 (AP): Judging by the line-up, Sundays inaugural celebration for Barack Obama at the Lincoln Memorial is a coveted gig for musics top names.        
	Beyonce, Bono, Bruce Springsteen, John Mellencamp, Usher, Shakira, Sheryl Crow, Josh Groban and James Taylor are among the musicians scheduled to perform on Sunday afternoon. The President-elect and his family are due to attend, with Obama expected to speak.        
	Other performers include Stevie Wonder, Renee Fleming, Garth Brooks, Mary J. Blige, Herbie Hancock, Heather Headley, John Legend and Jennifer Nettles. Historical passages will be read by Jamie Foxx, Martin Luther King III, Queen Latifah and Denzel Washington, with other celebrities expected to join them.        
	After getting the go-ahead from the Presidential Inaugural Committee two and a half weeks ago to put the show together, executive producer George Stevens Jr. said he quickly learned it would not be like any other special event he has tried to book.        
	On that first day, we asked Springsteen, Bono and Garth Brooks within a period of 45 minutes and got three yeses, Stevens said. We said: This is going to be fun. Stevens said he tried to reach out to a diversity of artists. The theme for the show, titled We Are One: The Obama Inaugural Celebration at the Lincoln Memorial, is less about celebration than national unification.        
	The list of stars is impressive, he said. But this is not a show biz, glitzy occasion. Its going to be rooted in history, remembering the great president (Lincoln) who led us through difficult times.        
	The artists wont be performing their big hits, but will be asked to perform material appropriate to the occasion. One musician will be asked to perform A Change Is Gonna Come, the song made famous by Sam Cooke.        
	Springsteen will perform The Rising, Stevens said. Stevens is a producer of The Kennedy Centre Honours.

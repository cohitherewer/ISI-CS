	Washington, July 31: They came, they met, they drank. They did not apologise.         
	The much-anticipated beer summit of President Obama, the Harvard scholar Henry Louis Gates Jr and Sergeant James Crowley of the Cambridge Police Department in Massachusetts took place last night.        
	It was accompanied by minute-by-minute reporting from the White House press corps, countdown clocks from the cable news networks and a last-minute addition by the White House in the form of Vice-President Joseph R. Biden Jr.         
	After 10 days of near nonstop news coverage of a case that prompted a thousand news stories about race, the men sat down for less than an hour at a table across from the Oval Office under a magnolia tree.        
	What you had today was two gentlemen who agreed to disagree on a particular issue, a poised and smooth Crowley said in a 15-minute news conference after the session. We didnt spend too much time dwelling on the past, and we decided to look forward. Gates said in an interview: I dont think anybody but Barack Obama would have thought about bringing us together.        
	The two men and their families first encountered each other in the White House library while each group was on individual tours of the White House yesterday afternoon. Nobody knew what to do, Gates said. So I walked over, stuck out my hand and said: Its a pleasure to meet you. That broke the awkwardness.        
	Crowley added that the families had continued the tour as a group while the beer talk commenced. He described the interaction between families as very cordial. Gates concurred, saying: We hit it off right from the beginning. When hes not arresting you, Sergeant Crowley is a really likaeble guy.        
	By the time the two men began their meeting with Obama, they could already report progress and told the President that they had made plans to lunch together soon.        
	I am thankful to Prof. Gates and Sergeant Crowley for joining me at the White House this evening for a friendly, thoughtful conversation, Obama said. Even before we sat down for the beer, I learned that the two gentlemen spent some time together listening to one another, which is a testament to them.        
	The addition of Biden was interesting, for a number of reasons. Biden was able to draw on his credibility with blue-collar, labour union America and his roots in Scranton, Pennsylvania, to add balance to the photo op that the White House presented: two black guys, two white guys, sitting around a table.

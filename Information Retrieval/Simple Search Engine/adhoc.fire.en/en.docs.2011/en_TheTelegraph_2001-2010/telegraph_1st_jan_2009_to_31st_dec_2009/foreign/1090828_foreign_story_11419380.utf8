	Jamrud (Pakistan), Aug. 27 (Reuters): A suicide bomber killed 22 Pakistani border guards today in an attack at the main crossing point into Afghanistan, officials said.        
	It was the first big attack in Pakistan since Pakistani Taliban chief Baitullah Mehsud was killed in a US missile strike on August 5.        
	The bomber struck as the guards were sitting down at sunset to break their daily fast for Ramazan. A senior official said 22 people were killed.

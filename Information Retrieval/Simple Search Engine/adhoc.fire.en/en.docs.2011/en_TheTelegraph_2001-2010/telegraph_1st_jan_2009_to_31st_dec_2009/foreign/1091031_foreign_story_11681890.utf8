	London, Oct. 30 (PTI): For once, the Queen of Pop is not getting what she wants and she is not happy about it.        
	Madonna was left fuming recently after Indian yoga guru Bikram Choudhury refused to give her private lessons.         
	According to entertainment website www.contactmusic.com, Madonna recently parted ways with her long-term fitness instructor Tracy Anderson. The Material Girl had said then that she wanted to try a new method of working out.        
	The 51-year-old singer is a big fan of Choudhurys style of yoga and wanted a one-on-one session with him. However, Choudhury turned down her request, accusing her of being too tempermental. He told the superstar that she would have to take a common class like everyone else.        
	Madonna came to me and asked for private lessons. I would have none of that. If you want to learn from me, then you have to come to my classes.         
	You have to leave your ego behind. If you disagree with her (Madonna), youre immediately blacklisted, Choudhury said.        
	He said that none of his other celebrity clients, not even George Clooney, Jessica Simpson and Jim Carrey, had objected to his methods. They do 90 minutes of yoga whenever theyre near a Bikram school, even when they are overseas, Choudhury said.

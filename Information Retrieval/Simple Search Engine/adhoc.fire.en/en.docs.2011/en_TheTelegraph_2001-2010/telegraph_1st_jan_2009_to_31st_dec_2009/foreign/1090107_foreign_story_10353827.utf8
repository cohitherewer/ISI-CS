The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Gunmen raid Lanka TV station
                                                                                                               Gunmen raid Lanka TV station
                            
	Colombo, Jan. 6 (Reuters): Masked gunmen threw grenades and destroyed the main studio of Sri Lankas largest private broadcaster today, days after state media criticised it for coverage of a Tamil Tiger suicide blast.        
	President Mahinda Rajapaksa condemned the early morning attack on MBC Networks studios and ordered an investigation.         
	The assault near the capital Colombo by about 15 attackers knocked MBC Networks three TV and four radio stations off the air for several hours after the gunmen blew up the master control room, witnesses said. MBC has clashed with the government in the past over its coverage, and again over the weekend was criticised by state-run media for giving too much coverage to a Tamil Tiger suicide blast on Friday after a major military victory.

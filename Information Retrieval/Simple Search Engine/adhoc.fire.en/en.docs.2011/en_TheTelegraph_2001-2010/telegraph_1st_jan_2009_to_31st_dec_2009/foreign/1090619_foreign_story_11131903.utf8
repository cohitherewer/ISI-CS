	Tehran, June 18 (Reuters): Tens of thousands of Iranians, wearing black and carrying candles, marched today to mourn those killed in mass protests against a presidential election they and defeated candidate Mir Hossein Mousavi say was rigged.        
	Chanting Allah-u-Akbar, they massed in downtown Imam Khomeini Square, responding to Mousavis call for people to gather in mosques or at peaceful rallies to show solidarity with the victims and their families.        
	Days of public fury over the disputed election led Irans top legislative body, the Guardian Council, to invite Mousavi and the two other candidates beaten by hardline President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad to discuss their complaints on Saturday.        
	The election has provoked Irans biggest and most violent demonstrations since the 1979 Islamic revolution, rocking the worlds fifth biggest oil exporter which is also caught up in a dispute with the West over its nuclear programme.        
	Iranian state media has reported seven or eight people killed in protests since the election results were published on June 13. Scores of reformists have been arrested across the country and authorities have cracked down on both foreign and domestic media.         
	Demonstrators held photographs of those killed, some showing bloodied faces, apparently taken after they died.        
	Our martyred brothers we will take back your votes, read one placard. Why did you kill our brothers? said another.        
	Mousavi, a moderate who advocates better ties with the West, addressed people in the crowd with a loudspeaker. He wore a black shirt and suit, witnesses said.        
	Other banners told protesters to stay at home tomorrow, when Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei is due to lead prayers in Tehran, but to gather again the next day in the capital.        
	Security agents detained Opposition politician Ebrahim Yazdi while he was in hospital, an ally said. Yazdi heads the banned Freedom Movement and was foreign minister in Irans first government after the revolution.        
	A spokesman for the Guardian Council said it had begun careful examination of 646 complaints submitted after the June 12 vote. Objections include a shortage of ballot papers, pressure on voters to support a particular candidate, and the barring of candidates representatives from polling stations.        
	Ahmadinejad was declared winner with nearly 63 per cent of the vote against 34 per cent for his closest rival, Mousavi. The reformist wants the vote annulled and held again. The council has said it is ready only to recount disputed ballot boxes.        
	Mousavi and fellow-candidates Mehdi Karoubi and Mohsen Rezaie could raise their objections at an extraordinary Guardian Council meeting on Saturday, said spokesman Abbasali Kadkhodai. Ahmadinejad defended the legitimacy of the vote, telling a cabinet meeting yesterday that it had posed a great challenge to the Wests democracy, Mehr news agency reported.        
	Foreign bomb plot        
	Irans intelligence ministry said today that it had uncovered a foreign-linked terrorist plot to plant bombs in mosques and other crowded places in Tehran during the June 12 presidential election.        
	State television aired a statement by what it said was one of those involved in the plot saying Americans in Iraq had given them the knowhow to build explosive devices.

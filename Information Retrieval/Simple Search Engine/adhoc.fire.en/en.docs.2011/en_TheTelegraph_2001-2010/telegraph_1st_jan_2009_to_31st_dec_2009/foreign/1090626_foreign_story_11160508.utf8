The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Iran to US: Dont interfere
                                                                                                               Iran to US: Dont interfere

	Tehran, June 25: As Irans embattled Opposition leader renewed a call for protests against the disputed presidential elections, President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad assailed President Obama today, telling him to stop interfering in Irans affairs and accusing him of striking the same hostile tone as his predecessor, George W. Bush.        
	The sharp words from the Iranian leader offered no prospect of eased tensions between Washington and Tehran at a time of continued confrontation over issues  apart from the elections  such as Irans nuclear programme and its support for Hezbollah in Lebanon and Hamas in Gaza which the US call terrorist organisations.        
	Ahmadinejads remarks, quoted on the semi-official Fars news agency, came as news reports suggested that more than a third of Irans 290 parliament members had snubbed a victory party for him last night. It also comes as Opposition figures said 70 academics had been arrested after meeting Opposition leader, Mir Hossein Moussavi.        
	On his website today, Moussavi said he was coming under pressure to withdraw his challenge to the election, which he says was stolen.         
	Another Opposition candidate, the third-place Mohsen Rezai, who won far fewer votes than Moussavi and was regarded as the most hardline of the Opposition candidates, withdrew complaints about electoral irregularities yesterday.        
	 Moussavi, who has not been seen in public for a week, said on his website Kalemeh that there were recent pressures on me aimed at withdrawing his challenge to the vote. He complained that his access to people is completely restricted, The Associated Press reported.        
	Reuters also quoted him as rejecting the governments crackdown. I insist on the nations constitutional right to protest against the election result and its aftermath, he said, complaining about the closure in recent days of an Opposition newspaper and the arrest of those who worked here. The illegal confrontation with the media opens the way for foreign interference, he said.        
	As the authorities have moved against Moussavis followers, there have been mounting fears among them that the Opposition leader is himself in danger of being detained  a move that could deepen the confrontation.        
	Yesterday, the official Iranian news agency reported that intelligence and security agents in Tehran concluded that a Moussavi campaign office was used for illegal gatherings, the promotion of unrest, and efforts to undermine the countrys security.         
	The news agency reported that the plotters have been arrested.        
	At the same time, though, some analysts had raised questions about Moussavis leadership of the Opposition. As a former Prime Minister who is essentially an insider thrust into the role of Opposition, it has not been clear how far he would go to defy the system. But the latest posting seemed to suggest continued resistance despite sweeping official action against his followers.        
	The reported arrests followed efforts by Iranian officials to finally crush all resistance to the presidential vote on June 12.         
	Yesterday, security forces overwhelmed a small group of protesters with brutal beatings, tear gas and gunshots in the air. Intelligence agents shut down an office of Moussavi, saying it was a headquarters for a psychological war.

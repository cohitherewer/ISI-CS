	Texting troubles    
	 Chicago, Feb. 13 (AP): So youre on a first date and you notice your potential love interest looking down and fiddling with a cellphone under the table. Or maybe he or she isnt even attempting to hide it.      
	Call it a sign of the times. Or maybe just a sign that he or she is just not that into you.       
	Oh, the fun of pretending to be interested in what someone else is typing to someone you dont know, says an exasperated Tyler Barnett, a 25-year-old businessman in Los Angeles who calls himself a textaholic but says he rarely does it on a date.      
	Not so for some of the women he has gone out with. He recalls one double date where the women he and his friend were with were both texting right at the table. Barnett suspected they were typing messages to one another, so he casually asked to see one of the womens new iPhones, and immediately checked her text message inbox. He was right.     
	Diva image    
	 New York (AP): A nude photo of a 20-year-old Madonna that appeared in Playboy has been sold at auction for $37,500. Christies believes that Lee Friedlanders full-frontal black and white image of Madonna is a record auction price for a photograph of her.

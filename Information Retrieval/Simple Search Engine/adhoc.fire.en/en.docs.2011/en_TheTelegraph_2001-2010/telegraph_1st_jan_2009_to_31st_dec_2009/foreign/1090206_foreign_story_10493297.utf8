	Jude cross    
	 London, Feb. 5: British actor Jude Law will appear as a transvestite in his new movie Rage, reports The Daily Telegraph.       
	The film, in which Law appears as a cross-dressing supermodel called Minx, is a murder mystery set in the New York fashion-house world.      
	Set to debut at the Berlin Film Festival, it examines the greed of the beauty industry. It also stars Dame Judi Dench, and Lily Cole as a starlet called Lettuce Leaf. Director Sally Potter has paid tribute to Laws courageous decision to take on the role.

	Generous Newman    
	 Los Angeles, Nov. 1 (PTI): Actor Paul Newman has been declared the most generous celebrity of 2008, leaving behind the likes of Brad Pitt, Angelina Jolie and Mel Gibson.      
	The actor, who passed away last September, donated more money to charity than any other US star, giving away $21 million to various initiatives and campaigns, according to a list compiled by Parade magazine.      
	Pitt and Jolie spent an estimated $13.4 million last year on good causes including a health clinic in Ethiopia and the redevelopment of New Orleans.    
	Pamela     
	 London (PTI): Pamela Andersons fashion designer friend Richie Rich has quashed rumours that the actress is pregnant. The 42-year-old Baywatch star was earlier spotted in London looking fuller than usual, sparking rumours that she was pregnant, Daily Express reported. Shes not pregnant... just happy. She doesnt have to say anything because they (rumours) are not true, Rich said. Anderson has two sons, Brandon and Dylan, with ex-husband Tommy Lee.    
	Posh error    
	 London (PTI): Victoria Beckham has said her decision to opt for a solo singing career, after the break-up of the Spice Girls, was a mistake. Popularly known as Posh Spice, Victoria is now a successful fashion designer but says she feels a bit lost about her singing career, the Mirror has reported online. People never believed the solo singing career, and it wasnt the real me, I was a little bit lost at the time. I dont mind making mistakes. I just cant live with anyone elses mistakes, Victoria said.    
	Ghost town    
	 London: Argleton, a phantom town in Lancashire that appears on Google Maps and online directories but doesnt actually exist, has puzzled Internet experts. The town appears on Google Maps in the middle of fields close to the M58 motorway, just south of Ormskirk, Lancashire. Its presence means online businesses that use data from the software have detected it and automatically treated it as a real town. An Internet search for the town now brings up a series of home, job and dating listings for people and places in Argleton, as well as websites which help people find its nearest chiropractor and even plan jogging or hiking routes through it. The businesses, people and services listed are real, but are actually based elsewhere in the same postcode area. Google and the company that supplies its mapping data are unable to explain the presence of the phantom town and are investigating.

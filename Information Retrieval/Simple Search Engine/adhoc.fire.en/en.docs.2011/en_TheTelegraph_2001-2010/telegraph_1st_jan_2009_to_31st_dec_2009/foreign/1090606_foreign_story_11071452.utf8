The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Desperate Brown shuffles cabinet

	London, June 5 (Reuters): British Prime Minister Gordon Brown sought to fend off a challenge to his authority today, shuffling his cabinet to secure the loyalty of several ministers and averting a government collapse.        
	In his second shuffle in eight months, Brown changed the heads of 10 ministries, but retained his finance minister, foreign minister and the head of the business ministry, shoring up his power in the teeth of widespread party dissent.        
	I will not waver, I will not walk away, I will get on with the job and I will finish the work, Brown told a news conference after giving details of the cabinet shake-up.        
	It included replacing six senior ministers who had quit their posts.        
	A day of high political drama took its toll on some markets, with the uncertainty sending sterling to a two-week low against the euro, before it recovered some ground.         
	But there was some relief for investors that finance minister Alistair Darling was to remain in his job.         
	Browns government has been under severe pressure for the past month, after a parliamentary expenses scandal exposed wrongdoing among politicians from all parties and left voters particularly angry with the incumbents.        
	In the shuffle, the Prime Minister had been expected to replace Darling, a close ally, but appeared to back away from that move after Darling made it known he did not want to go.         
	While the shake-up appeared to remove some of the doubt about the governments future, six ministers still quit their posts and Browns authority may still be called into question.        
	One of the most serious resignations was that of James Purnell, the work and pensions secretary and a rising star within the Labour Party, seen as a potential future leader.        
	Europe minister Caroline Flint accused Brown of using women as female window dressing in his government when she quit her post today.

	Scarlett routine    
	 London, Aug. 13 (PTI): Actress Scarlett Johansson has revealed that cooking helps keep her normal.       
	The stunning actress likes to unwind after a tough day by creating something in the kitchen as it gives her the routine she longs for, reports OK magazine.      
	After a long day at work, I really like to cook. I actually find cooking dinner a really nice routine, especially after working, it makes me feel normal again. There is something nice about the routine, Johansson said. Often when youre working, youre travelling around a lot and you feel kind of disconnected.

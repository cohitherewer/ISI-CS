The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Hotel is home for Obamas

	Washington, Dec. 31: Even in a town where the hotels are swamped for the inauguration, it turns out to be possible to get a room if youre the one being inaugurated.        
	President-elect Barack Obama and his family will move to the capital this weekend in time for his daughters to start school, aides said yesterday. With the White House still occupied and the official guest residence unavailable, the future first family will hole up in one of the citys most exclusive hotels.        
	The decision to come to Washington early will increase the spotlight on Obama as he tries to prepare for the presidency without yet assuming its burdens. Except for an afternoon visit with President Bush at the White House on November 10, Obama has stayed away from Washington during the transition, spending his time in Chicago and Hawaii instead.        
	The Obama team had asked about staying in Blair House, the government mansion across Lafayette Park from the White House. But the White House said it was booked for events until January 15, when it traditionally is available to a President-elect.        
	The Obama team instead found a hotel with a suite large enough for the presidential family until the Obamas can move to Blair House. Transition officials would not identify the hotel out of security concerns.

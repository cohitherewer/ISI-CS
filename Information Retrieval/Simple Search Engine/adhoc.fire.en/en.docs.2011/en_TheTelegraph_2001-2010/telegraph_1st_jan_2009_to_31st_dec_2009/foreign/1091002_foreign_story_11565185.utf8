	Shakira coin belly     
	London, Oct. 1 (PTI): It turns out you dont need to invest your life savings into dance lessons to wiggle like pop star Shakira because all you need is a coin.      
	The Colombian star says that she learned her moves from flipping a coin with her stomach muscles, reports The Sun. You just have to roll that belly... I used to practice by trying to flip a coin. But dont try that after eating, the singer said. Its one of those moves I just thought of in the studio when we were shooting the video and it felt right.

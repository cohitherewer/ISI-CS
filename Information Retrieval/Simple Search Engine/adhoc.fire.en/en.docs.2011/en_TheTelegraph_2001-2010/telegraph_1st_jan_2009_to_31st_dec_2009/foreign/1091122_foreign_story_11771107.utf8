	London, Nov. 21 (PTI): Eight hundred letters from writers in India and 31 other countries to people who will be alive in 2109 have been sealed and stored in Cambridges University Library as part of its 800th anniversary celebrations.        
	University staff and students, people from the wider Cambridge community and senior academics from around the world all took part in Letters To The Future project yesterday.        
	Their messages, which touch on subjects ranging from climate change and global recession to the progress of the current television series, X Factor, were sealed and stored in the presence of Queen Elizabeth II.        
	Each author has also been given a certificate to pass down to the future generations.         
	In 2109, anyone in possession of a certificate will be able to take it to the library and retrieve a message from their ancestor, said vice-chancellor Prof. Alison Richard.

	New York, May 30: It wasnt exactly what the British press had flown 5,632km to see: Prince Harry upstaged by a tree.         
	But there was the seething mass of news people penned behind police barricades, there was the tree  a Magnolia Elizabeth, just planted in a downtown Manhattan memorial garden  and there was His Royal Highness, Princess Dianas younger son, third in line to the throne and a veteran of the Afghanistan war, shovelling soil, half-hidden behind the leaves.        
	Harry, we cant see you! voices brayed. Come around front! The young prince obliged, happy no doubt to be making the kind of news that would not leave his family cringing.         
	Twenty years and four months after his mother enraptured New York with her own royal visit, Prince Harry, 24, arrived in a city fought over by his forebears, with a ginger toe-dipping in the waters of international relations, centering on acts of charity and a commemoration of the September 11 attacks. It was a sombre visit clearly designed to temper the princes tabloid reputation.        
	Flag-waving crowds lined up to cheer him, with adoring young women particularly plentiful. One was Roseanne Krylowski, 25, a Rutgers University student, who waited in the financial district with a sign that said NYC ? Prince Harry.         
	Within hours of arriving from London on Friday on a commercial ticket that was privately paid for by his grandmother, Queen Elizabeth, the strawberry blonde prince, in a dark blue suit, blue-and-white striped shirt and the maroon-and-blue striped regimental tie of the Household Division, laid a wreath at the site of the World Trade Center.         
	He spoke to firefighters and relatives of 9/11 victims and looked over blueprints for the sites reconstruction. Big question, he asked at one point. When is this supposed to be finished?         
	Then he dedicated the British Garden at Hanover Square, between Stone and Pearl Streets, which is a memorial to the 67 British people killed at the trade centre.

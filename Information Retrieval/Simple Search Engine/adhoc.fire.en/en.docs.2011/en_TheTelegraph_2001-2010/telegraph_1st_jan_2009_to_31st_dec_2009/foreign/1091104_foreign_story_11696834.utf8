	London, Nov. 3 (Reuters): Men have become so openly affectionate with each other using mobile technology they have taken to signing off text messages to male friends with a kiss (x), giving rise to a new generation dubbed Metrotextuals.        
	New research from mobile phone firm T-Mobile reveals nearly a quarter of men (22 per cent) regularly include a kiss on texts to their male mates, T-Mobile said in an emailed statement.        
	Metrotextuality is most widespread among 18-24 year old males with three quarters (75 per cent) regularly sealing texts with a kiss and 48 per cent admitting that the practice has become commonplace amongst their group of friends. Nearly a quarter of this age group (23 per cent) even appreciate an x in a text exchange from people that are not close friends.        
	But its not just younger men that have become Metrotextuals  one in 10 men over 55 often completes a text to another male with a kiss.

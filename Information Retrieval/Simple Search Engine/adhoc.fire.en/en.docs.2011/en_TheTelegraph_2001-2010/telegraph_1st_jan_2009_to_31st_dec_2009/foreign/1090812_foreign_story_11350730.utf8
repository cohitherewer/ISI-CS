	New York, Aug. 11: Eunice Kennedy Shriver, a member of one of the most prominent families in American politics and a trailblazer in the effort to improve the lives of people with intellectual disabilities, died early today morning at a hospital in Massachusetts. She was 88.         
	A family friend said Shriver had been in declining health for months, having suffered a series of strokes.        
	A sister of former US President John F. Kennedy and Senators Robert F. Kennedy and Edward M. Kennedy and the mother-in-law of California governor Arnold Schwarzenegger, Shriver never held elective office.         
	Some view her work on behalf of the mentally retarded, including the founding of the Special Olympics, as the most lasting of the Kennedy familys contributions.

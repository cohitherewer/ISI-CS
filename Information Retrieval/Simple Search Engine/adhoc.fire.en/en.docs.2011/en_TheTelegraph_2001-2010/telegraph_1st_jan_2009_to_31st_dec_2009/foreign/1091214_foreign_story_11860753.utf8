The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Google, the phone seller
                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      Google, the phone seller
                            
	Los Angeles, Dec. 13 (Reuters): Google Inc plans to sell its own cellphone direct to consumers as soon as next year, bypassing wireless operators in a rare strategic move, the Wall Street Journal cited sources as saying.        
	Called the Nexus One and made by smartphone maker HTC, the phone will run on the search giants Android operating system  around which Motorola and other cellphone makers have built devices  and will be sold online, the newspaper cited persons familiar with the matter as saying.        
	 Cellular service will have to be bought separately.        
	The Internet search leader may be sounding a challenge to wireless carriers such as Sprint and Verizon, as well as smartphone makers like Apple. It marks a departure for the leader in Web advertising, which has rarely sold devices directly to consumers.        
	Googles Android phones have won attention in the mobile industry lately, with Motorola and Sony Ericsson choosing to launch it with their new top models.        
	Analysts say the aim is to gain access to valuable consumer data that can be used to sell ads at premium prices, rather than to make money from direct hardware sales.

	New York, Jan. 16: Police divers found two women, going limp, with minutes to live in the icy waters between New York and New Jersey.         
	They were lethargic, said one of the divers, detective Michael Delaney. Their extremities were frozen cold.         
	He and the other diver, detective Robert Rodriguez, shoved one of the women aboard a boat. Delaney soon helped the other woman aboard as well.        
	That was the scene in the minutes after US Airways Flight 1549 slid into the Hudson river. For a moment after the water landing, it was a picture of eerie calm, the airplane floating on its belly in the centre of the river under a bright sky.         
	But very soon the water was churned by an ad hoc flotilla of boats and ferries flying the flags of almost every city, state and federal agency that works the waters around New York City. They sped toward the slowly sinking jet as its passengers climbed aboard the wings to await help.        
	The rescue began in the airplane itself, among the passengers. One passenger, Jeff Kolodjay, said he and others helped the women and children off the plane and onto ferries.         
	Vessels from the New York police and fire departments and the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey worked with New York Waterway ferries, which sent 14 boats, and the coast guard to the rescue.         
	Four New York police officers commandeered a Circle Line boat picking up tourists and commuters at 42nd Street and hurried to the jet.         
	The divers were at Floyd Bennett Field in Brooklyn when the call came over the radio of an airplane down. A pilot at the field, Michael Hendrix, 42, said he imagined it was a small airplane, a routine job.         
	Honorio Hector Rabanes, a deckhand, summed up the just-doing-our-jobs underplaying of the rescue typical of many who spoke of it. Basically, let me tell you, we were in the right place at the right time.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | From guns to unsure future

	Kathmandu, May 4 (PTI): A leader who once said that guns are the only way to change his country, Prachanda rose to become Nepals first post-monarchy Prime Minister through the ballot box.        
	However, today he faces an uncertain future after being forced out of office by his more seasoned rivals.        
	The 54-year-old former school-teacher announced his resignation today after the President blocked his move to replace the army chief with a loyalist general. Prachandas decision plunged Nepal into fresh turmoil and the spectre of renewed Maoist unrest loomed large.        
	Known as Chhabilal Dahal in his schooldays which he changed to Pushpa Kamal Dahal, Prachanda headed the countrys first Maoist-led government for eight months but with its fair share of problems, including the month-long tussle with Nepal Army chief General Rukmangad Katuwal.        
	The Maoist leader got his nom de guerre of Prachanda (the fierce one) after leading the former rebels in their decade-long armed struggle against the 240-year-old monarchy.        
	Remaining underground for 24 years, he scripted the 2006 peace process with Nepali Congress leader G.P. Koirala before the Maoists surprise victory in the April 10 Constituent Assembly polls.        
	Projecting himself first as the President, he later settled for the post of Prime Minister. However, that seemed to be in jeopardy after the defeat of the Maoist candidate in the presidential polls.        
	But last-minute manoeuvring saw the Maoists win the support of the CPN (UML) and the ethnic Madhesi Peoples Rights Forum. The Prachanda-led government was formed in August last year.        
	Known for his strident anti-India stand, Prachanda had been adamant on scrapping the Peace and Friendship Treaty of 1950 to be replaced by a new one. He also broke with tradition to visit China first after taking over as Prime Minister instead of coming to India.         
	Despite promising to maintain equal ties with both neighbours, India has been wary of his growing closeness with Beijing.

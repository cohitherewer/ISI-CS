The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Airport victim has right to sue
                                                                                                               Airport victim has right to sue
          CARRIE JOHNSON                          Ashcroft                                  
	Washington, Sept. 5: A Muslim man who was detained for weeks as a material witness in a terrorism case can sue former attorney-general John D. Ashcroft, a California court ruled yesterday as it rejected a bid for absolute legal immunity by the one-time cabinet official.         
	A three-judge panel of the federal appeals cour gave a green light to the case filed by Abdullah al-Kidd, a US citizen who was taken into custody at a ticket counter at Washington Dulles International Airport in 2003, while he was on his way to Saudi Arabia to study Islamic law and Arabic.         
	At the heart of the lawsuit is a strategy launched by the US justice department and the FBI after the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks.         
	Ashcroft, the attorney-general at the time, asserted that authorities would take suspected terrorists off the street and engage in aggressive detention of lawbreakers and material witnesses to disrupt possible al Qaida plots. FBI director Robert S. Mueller III cited al-Kidds detention in testimony to Congress about the bureaus success in protecting national security.         
	Al-Kidd and his attorneys argued that Ashcroft knew or should have known that the material witness statute was being used in a sweeping and abusive manner.         
	Ashcroft, who is being defended by the justice department, maintained that the case should be dismissed because he had no personal involvement in al-Kidds detention. He also argued that as the USs chief law enforcement officer at the time, he enjoyed broad protection from lawsuits.         
	But Judges Milan D. Smith Jr and David R. Thompson disagreed, writing that Ashcroft was not entitled to absolute legal immunity and that authorities had detained al-Kidd in part to conduct an investigation of his activities, without probable cause. Judge Carlos T. Bea wrote a partial dissent.         
	Al-Kidd, a Muslim convert who had been a standout running back on the University of Idaho football team, was confined in a high-security cell lit 24 hours a day, according to the opinion. He was strip-searched and transported, in shackles, across three states for 16 days before a court ordered his release.         
	Authorities could not offer evidence of criminal wrongdoing by al-Kidd, and he never testified in a court proceeding.         
	For more than 15 months after his release, al-Kidd was forced to live with his parents-in-law in Nevada, curtail his travel and report to a probation officer. He lost his job with a government contractor after being denied a security clearance. Since his arrest, he has separated from his wife, suffered emotional trauma and been unable to hold a steady job, the judges wrote.

	Mardan (Pakistan), May 11 (AP): Pakistani warplanes bombed suspected militant positions in a stronghold close to the capital today, pressing ahead with a fierce offensive the government claimed had killed 700 insurgents and put the Taliban on the run.        
	Interior minister Rehman Malik said 700 militants had been killed around Swat in the last four days. The operation will continue until the last Talib, Malik said in Islamabad. We havent given them a chance. They are on the run. They were not expecting such an offensive.        
	Maliks casualty number  which exceeds those given by the military yesterday by at least 200  and his claims of success could not be independently verified. The military is restricting access to the battlefields and many local journalists have also left. The government has not given figures for civilian casualties, but accounts from refugees suggest they are significant. The UN said 360,600 refugees had fled Swat and neighbouring Dir and Buner districts since operations began last week. That number is on top of some 500,000 people displaced by past offensives  a major humanitarian challenge for the weak government that could test public support for the offensive.        
	Jawad Khan, a university student who lives in the Kabal area of Swat, said jets bombed the nearby Dhada Hara village this morning. I saw smoke and dust rising from the village, Khan said, adding he didnt know about casualties because of curfew restrictions. A police official said jets bombed the Matta area of Swat today as well. The military launched the offensive after the insurgents in Swat used a peace deal to impose their reign in other neighbouring areas, including a stretch just 100km from Islamabad.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Army captures last Tiger town
                                                                                                               Army captures last Tiger town
                              Prabhakaran: Where is he?                            
	Colombo, Jan. 25 (Agencies): Sri Lankan soldiers captured the last major town held by Tamil Tiger separatists today, moving a step closer to finishing off one of Asias longest-running insurgencies, the army commander said.        
	The eastern port of Mullaittivu is one of the final targets of a military onslaught to end a 25-year war with the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) rebels. The army had not set foot inside it since the Tigers seized it in 1996.        
	After one months fight we have totally liberated Mullaittivu town, Lieutenant-General Sarath Fonseka said in an address on state television. We will be able to finish this war soon.        
	Fonseka said the LTTE-held area was down to 300sqkm, cut from 15,000sqkm when the war re-ignited in 2006.        
	The capture leaves the Tigers confined to a wedge of jungle in the north-east of the island, with its remaining defences and bases scattered in a handful of villages.        
	The 59th Division has been battling up the eastern coast towards Mullaittivu for a year and a month ago reached the edge of the fortified town, which served as a major LTTE operations base.        
	We have destroyed large-scale earthen defences and trenches. We have complete control of Mullaittivu and have destroyed the terrorists, Fonseka said.        
	Prabhakaran         
	An anti-LTTE Sri Lankan Tamil Minister today said guerrilla leader Velupillai Prabhakaran had virtually been cornered and could not escape from the island nation.        
	Prabhakaran has already tried shifting from one bunker to another or from one hiding place to the next in Wanni. But he cannot escape from the country, Douglas Devananda, the leader of the Eelam Peoples Democratic Front, said.

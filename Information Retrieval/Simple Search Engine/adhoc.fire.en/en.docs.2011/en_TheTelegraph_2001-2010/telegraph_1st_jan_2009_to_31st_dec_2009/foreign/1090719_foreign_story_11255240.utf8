The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Stars boost Broadway
                                                                                                               Stars boost Broadway
                              Craig: Not just Bond                            
	New York, July 18 (Reuters): A slew of Hollywood stars led by Hugh Jackman and Daniel Craig will open the new season of Broadway, as producers test whether star power will keep the Great White Way sparkling in tough times.        
	Jackman and Craig are teaming up for A Steady Rain, Jude Law will appear in Hamlet and Sienna Miller will make her Broadway debut in After Miss Julie, all opening in autumn.        
	Last seasons celebrities to take to the Great White Way included James Gandolfini, Susan Sarandon, Geoffrey Rush, Katie Holmes and Will Ferrell.        
	Stars boost sales, no small matter in the risky business of Broadway, said John Breglio, who is producing the musical Dreamgirls, which is set to open in November.        
	It is absolutely essential now to have a major star, a major star, to put on a play. And unless you have that, its very hard, he said. You know with stars in it you are guaranteed to at least get your money back.        
	He described as stupendous the pairing of Jackman, known for the X-Men films and winner of a Tony in 2004 for his role in the musical The Boy From Oz, and Craig, star of the latest James Bond films and a performer on the London stage.        
	Just the two of them will sell out every ticket. That is a huge coup, Breglio said.        
	But he is producing Dreamgirls with a cast of relative unknowns and said he believes musicals, more than plays, can still be financially successful without a celebrity.

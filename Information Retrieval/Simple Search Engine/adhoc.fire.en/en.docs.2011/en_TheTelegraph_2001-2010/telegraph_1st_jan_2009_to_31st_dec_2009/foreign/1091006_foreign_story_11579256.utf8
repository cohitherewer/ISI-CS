The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Pay 50 and jump queue at Heathrow
                                                                                                               Pay 50 and jump queue at Heathrow
                            
	London, Oct. 5 (PTI): A fast-track system will be introduced at Heathrow airport next year which will allow passengers paying an extra 50 to jump the immigration queue and avoid delays by using a fast gate.        
	Luton and Liverpool airports already allow passengers to jump the security queue if they pay extra when leaving the country, The Daily Telegraph reported today. British Airways announced last week that customers must pay to choose their seats more than 24 hours ahead of travel.        
	The hi-tech gates are being installed to read new biometric passports, which have chips containing details of the distances between a persons eyes, nose, mouth and ears.         
	However, at present only 19.7 million Britons have the new passports, which were introduced in March 2006. These people will be able to use the scheme free of charge, as will EU nationals with biometric travel documents.        
	The fast-track subscription programme will be offered to about 28 million people in Britain without biometric passports. The scheme will also be made available to trusted travellers from outside the EU.

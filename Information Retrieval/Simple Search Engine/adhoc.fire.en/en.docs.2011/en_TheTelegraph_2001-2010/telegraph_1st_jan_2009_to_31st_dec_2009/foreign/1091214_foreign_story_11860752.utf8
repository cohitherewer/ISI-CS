	Dec. 13: The wealth of media in modern life means the average person is bombarded with enough information every day to overload a laptop computer, a study has found.         
	Through email, the internet, television and other media, people are deluged with around 100,000 words a day  equivalent to 23 words per second, researchers claimed.         
	Scientists from the University of San Diego, California, who conducted the research, believe that the information overload may be having a detrimental effect on human brains.         
	They claimed that the strain of processing so much data meant people were becoming disconnected from one another and developing shorter attention spans.         
	Roger Bohn, co-author of the study called How Much Information, said: I think one thing is clear: our attention is being chopped into shorter intervals and that is probably not good for thinking deeper thoughts.         
	Edward Hallowell, a New York psychiatrist and author specialising in attention deficit disorder, said: Never before in human history have our brains had to process as much information as they do today.         
	We have a generation of people who I call computer suckers because they are spending so much time in front of a computer screen or on their mobile phone or BlackBerry.         
	They are so busy processing information from all directions they are losing the tendency to think and to feel.         
	Much of what they are exposed to is superficial. People are sacrificing depth and feeling and becoming cut off and disconnected from other people.         
	The study found that the daily word intake is equivalent to 34 gigabytes of information  enough to overload the typical laptop within a week.         
	Experts believe that the information overload could prompt brains to evolve in a new way.                     THE SUNDAY TELEGRAPH

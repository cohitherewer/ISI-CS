The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Lie to free bomber
                                                                                                               Lie to free bomber
          ANDREW ALDERSON                              
	London, Sept. 6: The British, Scottish and Libyan governments connived to free Abdel Basset al-Megrahi on compassionate grounds, it can be disclosed.         
	Medical evidence that helped Megrahi to be released was paid for by the Libyan government, which encouraged three doctors to say he had only three months to live.         
	The life expectancy of Megrahi, the only man convicted of the Lockerbie bombing of 1988 which killed 270 people, was crucial because, under Scottish rules, prisoners can be freed on compassionate grounds only if they are considered to have this amount of time, or less, to live.         
	Megrahi is suffering from terminal prostate cancer. Two of the three doctors commissioned by the Libyans provided the three-month estimates, while the third also indicated that the prisoner had a short time to live.         
	This contrasted with findings of doctors in June and July who had concluded that Megrahi had up to 10 months to live, which would have prevented his release.         
	Professor Karol Sikora, one of the examining doctors, told The Sunday Telegraph: The figure of three months was suggested as being helpful (by the Libyans).         
	To start with I said it was impossible to do that (give a three-month life expectancy estimate) but, when I looked at it, it looked as though it could be done  you could actually say that.         
	The prognosis from the three doctors  two from Britain  was used as part of the evidence by Scottish justice secretary Kenny MacAskill when he concluded that Megrahi should be released on compassionate grounds.         
	Mousa Kousa, a senior Libyan politician, played a key role in the talks to free Megrahi, and threatened serious consequences if the prisoner died in jail.         
	The Scottish and British governments actively assisted Megrahi to seek a release on compassionate grounds even though the thrust of talks before July had been over his release as part of a prisoner transfer agreement between Britain and Libya.                             THE SUNDAY TELEGRAPH

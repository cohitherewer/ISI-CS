	Islamabad, Dec. 27 (PTI): Two near-simultaneous terror strikes targeted Shia religious gatherings in Pakistani port city of Karachi and the capital of Pakistan-occupied Kashmir, Muzaffarabad, killing at least 10 people and injuring nearly 100.        
	A suicide bomber detonated explosives when police guards prevented him from entering the Pir Alam Shah Bukhari imambargah or Shia prayer hall in Muzaffarabad.        
	Provincial minister Ghulam Murtaza Gillani said 10 people were killed in the attack and 80, including some policemen, were injured.        
	The prayer hall is located in a high-security area near a military hospital, where the injured were taken.        
	Witnesses said they had seen the body parts of the bomber at the site. Scores of people were present in what is one of the largest Shia prayer halls in Muzaffarabad to mark the Islamic month of Muharram.        
	In Karachi, 20 people were injured when a bomb went off near a Shia procession in Qasba Colony. The police described the blast as a low-intensity explosion.        
	The explosion was followed by firing in the area, TV channels reported. It was not clear who had opened fire.         
	Both attacks occurred almost simultaneously shortly before 7 pm.         
	Karachi had been unaffected by a recent wave of bombings that has killed over 500 people across Pakistan but has witnessed sectarian attacks.

	Berlin, July 15 (Reuters): Oscar-winning director Robert Redford, at his peak considered one of the worlds sexiest men, has married his long-term German partner Sibylle Szaggars in Hamburg, a church spokeswoman said today.        
	Redford, 72, and Szaggars, a 51-year-old artist, have been together for more than a decade. The ceremony, in Szaggarss home town, took place at the five-star Louis C. Jacob Hotel in the northern port city on Saturday afternoon, Renate Massfeller of St Catherines Church said.         
	According to the Hamburger Abendblatt newspaper, the bride wore a champagne-coloured dress and Redford wore a white suit.

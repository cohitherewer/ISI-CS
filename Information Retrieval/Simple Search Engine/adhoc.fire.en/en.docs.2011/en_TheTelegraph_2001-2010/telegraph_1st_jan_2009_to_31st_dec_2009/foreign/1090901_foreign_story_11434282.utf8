	Aug. 31: A contestant on a Pakistani reality TV show drowned while performing a challenge for the programme, a spokeswoman for the shows sponsor said yesterday.        
	Saad Khan, 32, was swimming across a lake while wearing a 7kg backpack when he called out for help and then disappeared underwater, according to Fareshte Aslam, the information officer for Unilever Pakistan, the as-yet unnamed shows sponsor.        
	Horrified co-contestants and crew rushed to try to save him but could not find him in the murky waters of the lake in Bangkok, where the show was being filmed. Divers later recovered the body of Khan.        
	The death came during filming of the shows tenth episode on August 19 but it was not publicised until Khans body was returned to Karachi. Thai police were investigating to determine whether the death was an accident or caused by negligence.

          SOMINI SENGUPTA                          Lankans celebrate in Colombo. (AP)                                  
	New Delhi, May 20: The Sri Lankan President, Mahinda Rajapaksa, yesterday savoured a victory that had eluded every Sri Lankan head of state before him: he declared on television that after more than 25 years, his troops had defeated one of the worlds most enduring guerrilla armies on the battlefield.         
	Behind that victory speech was a historic and bloody family triumph, guided by two of the Presidents brothers: Gotabaya, the influential secretary of defence, and Basil, a so-called special adviser who devised the political strategy around the war effort.         
	Together, the brothers Rajapaksa defied international pressure to stanch civilian casualties, squelched dissent, blocked independent reporting of the war and achieved what many had thought all but impossible: they vanquished the Tamil Tigers, who had waged a pitiless war of terror and once ruled swathes of Sri Lankan territory as a de facto state.         
	With Gotabaya Rajapaksa in charge of the defence portfolio, the government sharply increased defence spending; bought new weapons, primarily from China and Pakistan; and nearly doubled the size of the armed forces, to roughly 160,000.         
	The political cunning of Basil and Mahinda Rajapaksa was put to use. The President asked India for weapons first. Only when it refused because of domestic sympathy for the Tamil cause did he turn to its rivals.         
	The military strategy paid off, too. Starting in 2006, the government forces staged intense air, sea and ground assaults against rebels in the east and the north, sustaining the attacks even though the two sides were still officially engaged in ceasefire negotiations.         
	The brothers, who come from upper-caste landed gentry, are not part of the English-educated elite of Colombo. Snubbing pressure from the West did not hurt them; it helped them consolidate their southern Sinhalese nationalist base.        
	There was no vacillation as there has been with previous governments, said Nilan Fernando, the country director for an American non-profit, the Asia Foundation. Previous governments were always playing for a draw. This time, they were playing for a win. They won.        
	The victory, like Russias smothering of Chechnyas separatist rebellion, comes at a high cost. The UN says 7,000 civilians have been killed since January alone, and more than 265,000 ethnic Tamils who fled the war zone are now interned in camps.         
	Some civilians are missing, including three government-employed doctors who worked in the rebel-held area and regularly spoke out about the shelling of hospitals there.         
	Now, some of Sri Lankas erstwhile allies, including those that had banned the Tamil Tigers as a terrorist organisation, are calling for an international commission of inquiry into possible war crimes. Sri Lanka desperately needs foreign aid for post-war reconstruction.        
	In prosecuting the war, President Rajapaksa, a lawyer and member of parliament who was elected, narrowly, in 2005, cultivated tacit backing from India. Though New Delhi did not supply offensive weapons, it became less active in seeking to stop the fighting.         
	In the 1980s, when anti-government ethnic Sinhalese activists were being abducted and killed, he was one of their most vocal champions, appealing to the UN for support. After his election, however, he put defeating the Tigers ahead of protecting civil liberties.         
	The Rajapaksas treated dissent as support for the enemy. Some journalists were jailed under an anti-terrorism law; some were mysteriously killed, including one newspaper editor, Lasantha Wickrematunge, who in a chilling essay, foretold his death and blamed Rajapaksa for it.         
	Gotabaya Rajapaksa, a former computer systems administrator in Los Angeles, accused international aid agencies working in Tiger-held territory of helping the insurgents. Last autumn, he ejected nearly all of them from the area.        
	Yesterday, in his speech to the nation, the President said a new political solution for minority Tamil rights could not be dictated from abroad. We do not have the time to be experimenting with the solutions suggested by other countries, he said. He spoke in generalities about forging a peace settlement, but he gave few details beyond saying it had to be acceptable to everyone in Sri Lanka.

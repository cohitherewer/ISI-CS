	Oslo, Nov. 26 (AP): Iranian authorities have confiscated Nobel Peace laureate Shirin Ebadis medal, the Norwegian government said today, accusing Iran of a shocking first in the history of the prize.        
	Norwegian authorities were told that Ebadis medal had been seized within the last week or so from a safe-deposit box in Iran along with personal effects including the diploma awarded with the medal, the foreign ministry said. Spokeswoman Ragnhild Imerslund would not name the source of the information but called the person reliable.         
	She added that Norwegian authorities have been in touch with Ebadi since the incident.

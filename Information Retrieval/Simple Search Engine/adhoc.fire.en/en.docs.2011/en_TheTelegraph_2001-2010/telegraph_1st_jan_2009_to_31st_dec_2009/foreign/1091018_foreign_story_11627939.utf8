	Dera Ismail Khan (Pakistan), Oct. 17 (Reuters): Pakistani forces launched a ground offensive against Taliban militants in South Waziristan on the Afghan border today, with soldiers advancing from three directions, officials said.        
	The assault follows a string of militant attacks that began on October 5 with the suicide bombing of a UN office in Islamabad and included assaults on the army headquarters, police and the public in which more than 150 people were killed.        
	In a show of unity before the offensive, government and party leaders gave the military full backing today, vowing to weed out militants and establish the writ of the state.        
	The operation has started, said military spokesman Major General Athar Abbas said. He declined to give details or say how long he expected the offensive would take.        
	Intelligence and government officials said troops were moving from three directions and some clashes had erupted.        
	The militants were firing rocket-propelled grenades, machine guns and anti-aircraft guns while government forces were using artillery, mortars and aircraft, intelligence officials said. Four soldiers were wounded, an official said.        
	The army says about 28,000 soldiers are taking on an estimated 10,000 hard-core Taliban, including about 1,000 tough Uzbek fighters and some Arab al Qaida members.        
	The army has for months been using aircraft and artillery to to soften up the militants defences while moving in troops to seal off the region. The army had stepped up air and artillery attacks in recent days.        
	Army chief General Ashfaq Kayani briefed government and party leaders today and they all agreed the militants posed a serious threat to the sovereignty and integrity of the state.

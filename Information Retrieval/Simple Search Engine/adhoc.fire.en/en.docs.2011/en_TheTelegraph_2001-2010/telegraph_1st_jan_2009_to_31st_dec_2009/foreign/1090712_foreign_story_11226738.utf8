	London, July 11 (AP): Britains Big Ben is marking its 150th birthday with a celebration in London today.        
	The booming bell first pealed on July 11, 1859  a few weeks after the clock in the famous tower above the houses of parliament began keeping time.        
	Mike McCann, the keeper of the Great Clock, says Big Ben stands as a magnificent example of engineering  and is much-loved. Its bongs are a cherished feature of life in London.

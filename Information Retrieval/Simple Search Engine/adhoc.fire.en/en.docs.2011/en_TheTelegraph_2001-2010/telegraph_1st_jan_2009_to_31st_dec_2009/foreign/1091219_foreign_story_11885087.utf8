	Baghdad, Dec. 18 (Reuters): A senior Iraqi official said Iranian soldiers crossed into Iraqi territory today and took up position at a southern oilfield whose ownership is disputed by Iran.        
	However, Tehran denied the report.        
	Iraqi deputy interior minister Ahmed Ali al-Khafaji said the incursion was the latest in a series this week at the Fakka oilfield, around 300km southeast of Baghdad, in Maysan province.        
	At 3:30 this afternoon, 11 Iranian (soldiers) infiltrated the Iran-Iraq border and took control of the oil well. They raised the Iranian flag, and they are still there until this moment, he said.         
	Irans semi-official Mehr news agency later quoted the National Iranian Oil Company (NIOC) as rejecting the report.        
	The company denies Iranian soldiers taking control of any oil well inside Iraqi territory, Mehr quoted the NIOC as saying.        
	Khafaji said Baghdad had taken no military action and stressed it would seek a measured, diplomatic response to the situation.We are awaiting orders from our leader.

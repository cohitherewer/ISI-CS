	Mariah pee-ved    
	 London, Sept. 11 (PTI): Pop star Mariah Careys pet dog Cha Cha left her drenched in urine after he relieved himself on her just before a live performance.       
	The 40-year-old singer was devastated when her Jack Russell terrier Cha Cha had an accident as she was getting ready to perform. OK so Cha Cha just peed on the floor in my dressing room and then decided to jump on top of me as I am doing my make-up. Real classy here, Carey wrote on her Twitter page.

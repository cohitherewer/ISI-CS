The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Chinese buy GMs Hummer
                                                                                                               Chinese buy GMs Hummer
                            
	Detroit, Oct. 10 (Reuters): General Motors Co has signed a deal to sell its iconic-but-tarnished Hummer brand to an investment partnership headed by an obscure Chinese machinery maker in an agreement that underscores the fast rise and global ambition of the Chinese auto industry.        
	The deal with Chinas Sichuan Tengzhong Heavy Industrial Machinery caps a year-long struggle by GM to shed the SUV brand that had become synonymous with gas-guzzling excess. It marks the first time that Chinese investors have stepped in as buyers into the US auto industry.        
	The sale comes at a time China has emerged as the worlds largest auto market and GM remains majority-owned by the US government after being driven into bankruptcy.        
	The long-term game plan is to ride the China wave, said Jim Taylor, the GM executive who has helped steer the sale.        
	A person familiar with the deal said on Friday that the Hummer business would be sold for about $150 million, far less than GMs early estimate that the Hummer could fetch more than $500 million.

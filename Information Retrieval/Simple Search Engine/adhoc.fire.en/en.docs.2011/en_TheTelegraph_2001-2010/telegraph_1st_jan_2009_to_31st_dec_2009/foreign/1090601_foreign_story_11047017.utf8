	New cloud    
	 London, May 31: An unusual type of storm cloud could become the first new variety of cloud to be officially identified in more than half a century, reports The Sunday Telegraph.       
	Meteorologists believe they have discovered a new classification of cloud after the unique formation has been spotted in skies around the world.       
	The cloud type, unofficially named Asperatus after the Latin word rough, forms a dark, lumpy blanket across the sky.       
	The underside of the clouds is quite rough and choppy. It looks very stormy, but some reports suggest they tend to break up without turning into a storm.    
	Beyonce    
	 London (PTI): Beyonce Knowles seems to be taking her lyrics a little too literally. The If I Were A Boy singer says she loves nothing more than jogging dressed as a guy, The Mirror online has reported. The pop star, who is known for her curvaceous figure, said: I dress up like a boy and no one knows its me.     
	Peas scare    
	 London: Staff at a Newcastle airport recently issued a security warning after a passenger tried to carry pease pudding on to a plane, reports The Sunday Telegraph.       
	The traditional snack  made from boiled split peas and ham fat  was confiscated from hand luggage at Newcastle International Airport. It was part of the 450 litres of banned liquids seized by staff each day.

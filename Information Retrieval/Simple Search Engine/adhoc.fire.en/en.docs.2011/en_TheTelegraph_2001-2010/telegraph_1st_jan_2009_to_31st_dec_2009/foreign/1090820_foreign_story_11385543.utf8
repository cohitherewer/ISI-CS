The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | US cracks open Swiss bank vault
                                                                                                               US cracks open Swiss bank vault
          DAVID S. HILZENRATH                          A UBS office in New York. (AFP)                                  
	Washington, Aug. 19: The Swiss government will turn over names of suspected tax-dodgers who have held 4,450 secret accounts at banking giant UBS.        
	The accounts, at one point, held as much as $18 billion, US officials said this morning.        
	The settlement follows a long-running effort by the US government to penetrate Swiss bank secrecy and catch tax evaders. The US had been seeking a federal court order demanding that UBS identify the American holders of 52,000 accounts. The Swiss government vowed to prevent such a disclosure, leading to weeks of negotiations and todays announcement.        
	We will be receiving an unprecedented amount of information, Internal Revenue Service (IRS) commissioner Doug Shulman said this morning. This agreement represents a major step forward with the IRSs efforts to pierce the veil of bank secrecy and combat offshore tax evasion.        
	The process could take a year.        
	Schulman said the deal sends an unmistakable message to tax dodgers: Wealthy Americans who have hidden their money offshore will find themselves in a jam, he said.        
	The Swiss government has agreed to work with the US on similar requests for disclosure involving other Swiss banks, Schulman said in a conference call with reporters. IRS officials offered no estimate of how much the agency might recoup in back taxes and penalties.        
	This agreement helps resolve one of UBSs most pressing issues, UBS chairman Kaspar Villiger said.         
	I am confident that the agreement will allow the bank to continue moving forward to rebuild its reputation through solid performance and client service. UBS welcomes the fact that the information-exchange objectives of the settlement can be achieved in a lawful manner under the existing treaty framework between Switzerland and the US.        
	UBS will pay no penalties under the deal, the bank said.        
	Switzerland was fighting to preserve the reputation for privacy that has made its banking industry a global powerhouse and a pillar of the Swiss economy.        
	The deal includes potentially face-saving concessions for Switzerland, as it attempts to argue that its tradition of secrecy survived the battle. The US agreed to narrow its request for names to those considered most likely to have engaged in tax evasion.        
	More importantly, the US agreed to drop its federal lawsuit against UBS and pursue the information through a Swiss legal channel under a tax treaty between the two countries. The US government tried to use that channel last year but got nowhere.

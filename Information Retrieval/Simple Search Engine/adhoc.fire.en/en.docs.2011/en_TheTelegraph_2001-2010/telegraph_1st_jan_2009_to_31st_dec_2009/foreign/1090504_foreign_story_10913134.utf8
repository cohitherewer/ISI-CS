The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Swine flu on the wane
                                                                                                               Swine flu on the wane

	Mexico City, May 3 (Reuters): Mexico has moved past the peak of an H1N1 flu epidemic and is in the phase of descent, the government said today, although world health officials still say the virus could become a pandemic.        
	Health minister Jose Angel Cordova said the outbreak appeared to have peaked in Mexico between April 23 and 28 and fewer people were hospitalised with serious flu symptoms in the last few days.        
	The evolution of the epidemic is now in its phase of descent, he told a news conference in Mexico City. He added, though, it was too early for Mexico to let down its guard.        
	Colombia became the latest country to report a confirmed case of the disease, which mixes swine, avian and human flu strains.        
	The US government said today it hoped to have a vaccine ready by autumn.        
	Mexico has seen a stabilisation in the last few days, with fewer people dying from the new flu. Health authorities have scaled back their estimate of how many people could have died from the flu strain to more than 100, from as many as 176.        
	Only 19 deaths in the country have been confirmed as being caused by the new virus.        
	The World Health Organization said the H1N1 influenza had not spread in a sustained way outside North America, as required before the pandemic alert is raised to its highest level. But it said that would probably happen soon.        
	In Canada, health officials said a traveller carried the virus from Mexico to Canada and infected his family and a herd of swine.        
	Action by Chinese authorities to hold Mexicans in hotels and other places, irrespective of whether they were ill or not, sparked a diplomatic dispute with Mexico.        
	In Hong Kong, police quarantined a hotel for one week after a Mexican guest was found to have the virus, and Mexicans also were being confined in Beijing and Shanghai.        
	Mexican foreign minister Patricia Espinosa criticised China, saying Mexicans who showed no signs of illness were being isolated, under unacceptable conditions.

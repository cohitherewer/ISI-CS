The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Lohan in mock dating video ad
                                                                                                               Lohan in mock dating video ad
                            
	New York, April 15 (AP): Lindsay Lohan is on the prowl again.        
	The much-gossiped-about starlet has made a mock dating service video posted on comedy website FunnyOrDie.com. Lohan, 22, recently said that she and DJ Samantha Ronson are taking a brief break.        
	The video, posted yesterday, is in the guise of an online dating ad. Lohan says shes recently single... I think. She says shes looking for someone to spend the rest of her life with, or at least the rest of my probation with.        
	Lohan pokes fun at herself, saying shes looking for the perfect mate who likes long walks on the beach, car chases on the Pacific Coast Highway, antiquing and passing out in Cadillac Escalades.        
	A spokeswoman for FunnyOrDie, co-founded by Will Ferrell, says the video was shot last weekend.

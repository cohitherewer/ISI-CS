	The historical legacy of 1989, when the Berlin Wall fell and the Cold War thawed, is as political as the upheavals of that decisive year.        
	The events of 1989 spurred a striking transformation of Europe, which is now whole and free, and a reunified Germany, milestones that are being observed with celebrations all over the continent.        
	But 1989 also created new divisions and fierce nationalisms that hobble the EU today, between East and West, France and Germany, Europe and Russia.        
	Some of the intensity of those divisions is evident in the tug of war, in both Europe and the US, over the achievements of 1989  whether they owe more to the resolute anti-communism of Ronald Reagan or its inverse, the white-glove embrace of the East by many in Western Europe.        
	While many in the West saw the wheel of history spinning inevitably, causing the rise of democracy and banishing serious rivals to American power, China forestalled its own revolution in 1989 and catapulted itself to prominence through an authoritarian capitalism that the leaders of Russia are now studying.        
	The Chinese ended up with a Leninist capitalism, which none of us imagined in 1989, and which is now the main ideological competitor to western liberal democracy, said Timothy Garton Ash, a chronicler of 1989 in his book The Magic Lantern.        
	It is a tribute to 1989, not unlike the French Revolution 200 years before it, that its meaning is hotly contested. Different groups in different countries see the anniversary differently, usually from their own ideological points of view.        
	In general, said James M. Goldgeier of George Washington University, a historian of the period: The big question out there for 20 years is who gets the credit.         
	For many in the US, he said, most of the credit now goes to President Ronald Reagan and his aggressive military spending and antagonism towards communism.        
	 That view has largely eclipsed another American perspective, which was that globalisation and democratisation were so powerful that a Mikhail Gorbachev was inevitable, and that the Cold War ended through soft power  propaganda, diplomacy and the Helsinki accords. As the partisan divide over Reagan has dissipated, I think over time most Americans, if they think back at all, say it was Reagan who said, tear down this wall, and down it came, Goldgeier said.        
	Robert Kagan, a historian with the Carnegie Endowment in Washington and an editor of The Weekly Standard, said conservatives won the debate. The standard narrative is Reagan, he said.        
	This is not the case in Europe, Kagan said. If 90 per cent of Americans say it was the US being firm, 99 per cent of Europeans think it was they being soft.        
	For many Americans, 1989 seemed a wonderful example of the embrace of universal values that happened to be theirs, and some believed it was only a matter of time before all dictatorships crumbled before the same forces of strength, openness, economic liberalism and people power.        
	Democrats argue that former President George W. Bush learned the wrong lesson from 1989, about the utility of force, and Republicans argue that former President Bill Clinton and President Barack Obama learned the wrong lesson  that engagement with totalitarian power, whether in China or Iran, will weaken or destroy it.        
	One result of 1989 was the end of a bipolar world, but after a brief 20-year reign the period of American unipolarity is also ending, many Europeans say.         
	A scramble for power and influence among several nations and blocs of nations  Europe, China, Russia, India, Brazil and the US  now seems likely. Dominique Mosi of the French Institute for International Relations said: America is in relative decline, but has not yet accepted the changes, speaking of multilateralism but not accepting the consequences.        
	 In this transitional world, he said, nothing can be done without America, but nothing can be done by America alone.        
	But Americans are not likely to agree with this interpretation. Robert D. Blackwill, a longtime diplomat, argues for the necessity of American leadership: I see no evidence that America is in decline.

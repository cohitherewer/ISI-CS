The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Iran to teach rioters a lesson
                                                                                                               Iran to teach rioters a lesson

	Tehran, June 23 (Reuters): Iranian authorities said they would teach an exemplary lesson to rioters held in the worst unrest since the birth of the Islamic Republic and accused western powers of inciting the violence.        
	The official Irna news agency quoted senior judiciary official Ebrahim Raisi as saying on state television late yesterday: Those arrested in recent events will be dealt with in a way that will teach them a lesson. He said a special court was studying the cases. The rioters should be dealt with in an exemplary way and the judiciary will do that, Raisi said.         
	Riot police and Basij militia on Tehrans main squares warded off the mass protests that have marked the week since disputed elections. Irans hardline leadership appeared to have gained the ascendancy, at least for the moment.        
	The conflict, which has yielded unprecedented signs of division in the religious leadership, began to play out on the diplomatic level with Britain the focus of anger. London said two of its diplomats had been expelled from Iran and it had ordered out two Iranians in retaliation.        
	In Washington, President Barack Obama, who condemned the Iranian governments response to public demonstrations, said today that Tehran had a path to improve ties with the international community.        
	We have provided a path whereby Iran can reach out to the international community, engage and become a part of international norms, Obama said at a news conference. It is up to them to make a decision as to whether they choose that path. He added that what has been seen recently has not been encouraging.        
	A group of about a hundred hardliners gathered in front of the British embassy in Tehran, chanting British embassy should be closed, a witness told Reuters.         
	Supporters of hardline anti-western President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad held a news conference in the building of the old US embassy that was seized by students after the Islamic Revolution in 1979 and held with 52 US hostages for 444 days.        
	We dont need to have such useless relations with Britain ... If Britain continues its interference in Iran, we will destroy their houses over their heads, said one of the student leaders.        
	Irans top legislative body, the Guardian Council, rejected demands for a re-run from former Prime Minister Mir Hossein Mousavi, who says he is the rightful victor in elections that were rigged.        
	Mousavi, himself a scion of the religious establishment, says he does not seek to undermine the Islamic Republic but to purge it of what he calls lies and deceit.        
	Iranian state television, in a broadcasts clearly intended to discredit opponents defying a ban on protests, paraded people it said had been arrested during weekend violence.        
	I think we were provoked by networks like the BBC and the VOA (Voice of America) to take such immoral actions, one young man said. His face was shown but his name not given.        
	 A woman whose face was pixellated said she had carried a war grenade in her hand-bag. I was influenced by VOA Persian and the BBC because they were saying that security forces were behind most of the clashes.

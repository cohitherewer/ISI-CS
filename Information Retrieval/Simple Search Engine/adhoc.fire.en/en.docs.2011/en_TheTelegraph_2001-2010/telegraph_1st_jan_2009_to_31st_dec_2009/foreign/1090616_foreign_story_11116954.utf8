	New York, June 15 (PTI): Three Indian Americans, including an 11-year-old boy, were killed when a small family-owned plane carrying them nosedived into the Mohawk river here during an afternoon leisure trip.        
	Albany-based hotelier George Kolath, who hails from Kerala, was entertaining his son and a doctor friend when the Piper Cherokee went down shortly after taking off from the nearby Mohawk Valley Airport yesterday, Federal Aviation Administration spokesman Jim Peters said.        
	The body of the boy, George Kolath Jr, and that of the doctor, whose name was not released by authorities, were found, Kolaths brother-in-law Anil Paulose said.        
	However, the body of 42-year-old Kolath, who owns several hotels as well as a $40-million castle in Albany, was yet to be recovered, local media reports said. The search was stopped because of darkness.        
	He stopped for lunch at a small airport and they took off and (after) their takeoff, we dont know what happened, Paulose said. It (the plane) fell into the water.

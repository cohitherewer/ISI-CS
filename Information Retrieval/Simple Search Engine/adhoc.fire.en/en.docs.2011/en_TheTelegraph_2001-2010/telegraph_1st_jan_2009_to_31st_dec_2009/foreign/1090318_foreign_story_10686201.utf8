                                                                                                               Nepal row over generals 
          J. HEMANTH                               
	Kathmandu, March 17: The Nepal defence minister today rejected the army chiefs request that the tenure of the eight brigadier-generals who retired yesterday be extended, deepening the tension between the Maoist government and the military.        
	After defence minister Ram Bahadur Thapas refusal, army chief Rukmagat Katuwal urged President Ram Baran Yadav to intevene. However, the President asked the general to seek the help of Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal, alias Prachanda.        
	Katuwal had reportedly told Yadav that the extension was sought in accordance with the Nepal Army Act.         
	Katuwal has also asked the retired brigadier-generals, Pawan Bahadur Pande, Shushil Pant, Raju Pratap KC, Kumar Budhathoki, Narendra Rawal, Shiva Poudel, Nar Bahadur Kandel and Pradeep Bikram Rana to continue in office till their extension is approved.         
	The army has been at loggerheads with Thapa, who was the commander of the Maoist Peoples Liberation Army during the insurgency.

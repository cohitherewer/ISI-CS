The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Chile says swine flu in birds
                                                                                                               Chile says swine flu in birds
                            
	Santiago, Aug. 21 (AP): Chile said today that tests show swine flu has jumped to birds, opening a new chapter in the global epidemic.        
	A top UN animal health expert said the infected turkeys have suffered only mild effects, easing concern about a potentially dangerous development. Chiles turkey meat remains safe to eat, the expert said.        
	Chiles health ministry said it ordered a quarantine today for two turkey farms outside the port city of Valparaiso after genetic tests confirmed sick birds were afflicted with the same virus that has caused a pandemic among humans.        
	So far, the virus  a mixture of human, pig and bird genes  has proven to be very contagious but no more deadly than common seasonal flu.

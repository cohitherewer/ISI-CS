	The film features footage of Zeppelin airships flying over England during World War I, and out-takes from three pictures that Chaplin shot with the film company Essanay. An animated scene shows Chaplin wishing he could leave America to join his British countrymen in the war, before being taken on a cloud and deposited on an English church spire.

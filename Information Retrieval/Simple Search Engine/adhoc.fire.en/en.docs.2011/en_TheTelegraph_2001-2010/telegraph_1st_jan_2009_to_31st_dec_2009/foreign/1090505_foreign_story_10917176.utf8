                                                                                                               Dylan on top of UK charts after 38 years
                            
	London, May 4: Bob Dylan is top of the British album charts for the first time in almost 40 years.         
	Together Through Life comes 38 years and five months after he last claimed the top spot, meaning the American singer-songwriter now holds the record for the longest gap between solo number one albums.        
	His last chart topper was New Morning which was released in October 1970, reaching number one on November 28. Together Through Life is Dylans seventh UK number one, his 33rd studio album and his 53rd album, including compilations and soundtracks. He first reached number one with The Freewheelin Bob Dylan released in 1964.        
	The previous record for the longest gap between number on albums was held by Welsh crooner Tom Jones.        
	His 1999 comeback, Reload, topped the UK charts in October of that year, more than 31 years after Delilah reached the top in August 1968.Gennaro Castaldo from HMV said: Dylan is arguably our greatest cultural icon, and his words and music remain as relevant and as powerful today as they did five decades ago.

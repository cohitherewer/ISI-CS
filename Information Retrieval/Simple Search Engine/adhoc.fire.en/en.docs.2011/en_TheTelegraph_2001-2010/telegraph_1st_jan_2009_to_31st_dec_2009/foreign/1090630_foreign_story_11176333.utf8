	London, June 29 (PTI): A British skier, who had slipped into a crevasse in the Swiss Alps, was saved from plunging nearly 700 feet to his death by his BlackBerry.         
	David Fitzherberts 3 cm- wide handset in his breast pocket caused him to get wedged in a crack of ice, stopping him from falling further. Incredibly, the device still worked after keeping him stuck for almost two hours till he was rescued.        
	The 52-year-old was skiing down a glacier in the Matterhorn and Monterosa peaks in the Swiss Alps when the snow collapsed. The snow gave way beneath me and I fell down a very deep crevasse. After 70 feet it narrowed and I became stuck like a cork in a bottle between the walls. Fortunately the extra centimeters of the Blackberry were enough to block the fall, Fitzherbert told The Sun. He broke his jaw, smashed his teeth and cracked a bone in his chest.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Intense light can detect Parkinsons
                                                                                                               Intense light can detect Parkinsons
                            
	London, Feb. 14: A light as bright as a million-watt bulb could help detect the early stages of Parkinsons disease, according to scientists.         
	A team from Keele University, in Staffordshire, are using a super-microscope to spot changes in brain cells before the disease destroys them.        
	Joanna Collingwood, told the American Association for the Advancement of Science conference in Chicago, that the technique could allow patients to receive treatment sooner.         
	The researchers have been using a synchrotron  or Diamond Light Source (DLS)  at Harwell, Oxfordshire.         
	The device is a large doughnut-shaped particle accelerator, the size of five football pitches, which fires particles at just below the speed of light, focusing them into a beam less than a single cell in diameter.        
	It allows researchers to observe iron levels in individual brain cells, which are affected by Parkinsons.

	Islamabad, April 27: A radical cleric who has been mediating peace talks between the government and Taliban militants broke off negotiations today to protest a military operation mounted by government forces in an adjoining district.        
	We are suspending talks with the government until the military operation in Dir is halted, said Amir Izzat, a spokesman for Maulana Sufi Muhammad, a cleric who is the leader of the banned movement Tehrik-e-Nafaz-e-Shariat Muhammadi.        
	However, the movement still adhered to the February peace agreement, but would only resume talks when the operation stopped, he said.         
	Yet the uneasy peace that has lasted in the Swat Valley since the February accord looked increasingly imperiled as both sides accused the other of violating the agreement.        
	The Pakistani paramilitary force, Frontier Corps, continued their operations in Dir today with helicopter gunships pounding militant hideouts. Twenty militants were killed in operations in the Maidan area of lower Dir today, a military statement said. Earlier, briefing reporters, interior ministry chief Rehman Malik said security forces had killed at least 30 militants overnight.        
	 Malik said the operations were launched in retaliation to the Taliban trying to extend their influence outside the Swat Valley. Local residents were reported to be fleeing the district. Schools and markets were closed and the area was under curfew, local television reported. Malik said the government forces moved in at the behest of local residents and the provincial government who were worried about the presence of armed militants entering mosques and peoples homes.         
	Militants in Swat, their stronghold, reacted with a warning that they would resume fighting unless the operation was stopped. Today, militants seized control of the telephone exchange in Bahrain, a town half way up the Swat Valley local officials said.         
	Lower Dir comes under the February peace agreement under which the government agreed to the imposition of Sharia courts in the Malakand Agency and both sides agreed to halt military activities.         
	Relative peace returned to the Swat Valley as Pakistani Army troops returned to their bases. However, armed militants continued to move freely around the region and have spread into adjoining districts. They have insisted they will remain armed until the Sharia courts are set up and functioning. The militants appear to be set on spreading their influence to a growing area and seizing goods, vehicles and belongings from local residents.

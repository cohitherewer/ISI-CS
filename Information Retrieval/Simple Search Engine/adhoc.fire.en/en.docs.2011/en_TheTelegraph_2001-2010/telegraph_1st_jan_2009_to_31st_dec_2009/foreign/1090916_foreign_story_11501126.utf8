	Baghdad, Sept. 15 (Reuters): The Iraqi journalist, who threw his shoes at former President George W. Bush, was released today after nine months in prison.        
	He said Iraqi security forces tortured him with beatings, whippings and electric shocks after his arrest.        
	Muntadhar al-Zaidi, whose stunning act of protest last December made him a hero around the Arab and Muslim worlds, said he now feared for his life and believed that US intelligence agents would chase after him.        
	These fearsome services, the US intelligence services and its affiliated services, will spare no efforts to track me as an insurgent revolutionary ... in a bid to kill me, he told a news conference at the TV station where he works.        
	And here I want to warn all my relatives and people close to me that these services will use all means to trap and try to kill and liquidate me either physically, socially or professionally, he said, wearing a scarf in the colours of the Iraqi flag draped around his neck.        
	The 30-year-old reporters act of protest deeply embarrassed Iraqs Prime Minister, Nouri al-Maliki, who was standing beside Bush at a December 14 news conference when al-Zaidi suddenly shot up from his chair had hurled his shoes towards the podium.         
	Bush, who was on his final visit to Iraq as American President, was unhurt but had to duck twice to avoid being hit.        
	The reporter said today that he was abused immediately after his arrest and the following day. He said he was beaten with iron bars, whipped with cords and was electrocuted in the backyard of the building in the Green Zone where the news conference was held.         
	In the morning, I was left in the cold weather after they splashed me with water, he said. He promised to reveal the names of senior government officials and army who he said were involved in mistreating him.

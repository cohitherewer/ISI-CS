                              Zardari: War of survival                            
	New York, Feb. 14 (Reuters): The Taliban have established themselves across a large part of Pakistan, forcing the country to fight a war against the hardline Islamist group that is about Pakistans own survival, President Asif Zardari has told CBS News.        
	(The Taliban) do have a presence in huge amounts of land in our side. Yes, that is the fact, Zardari told 60 Minutes in an interview to be broadcast tomorrow. Excerpts of the interview were released yesterday. President Barack Obama said this week there was no doubt terrorists were operating in safe havens in the tribal regions of Pakistan.        
	Zardari said Pakistan had been in denial about the Taliban in the past. Our forces werent increased... . We have weaknesses and they are taking advantage of that weakness, he said. Zardari has now put 120,000 soldiers into the fight against the Taliban, despite concerns among many Pakistanis that their country is fighting a proxy war for the US.

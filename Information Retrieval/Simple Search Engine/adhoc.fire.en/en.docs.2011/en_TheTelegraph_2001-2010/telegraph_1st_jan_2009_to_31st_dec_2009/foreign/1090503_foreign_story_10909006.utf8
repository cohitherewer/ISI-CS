	Mega police    
	 London, May 2: Northamptonshire police being ordered to use megaphones to shout crime prevention advice at residents who leave their doors or windows open, reports The Daily Telegraph.       
	Officers have also been instructed to go into unlocked properties and alert homeowners to the security risk  even to the point of waking them up if they are asleep.      
	It is all part of a scheme that will see them patrolling the streets with the megaphones, shouting at homeowners to ensure their properties are properly protected.      
	The move is part of an initiative to crack down on summer burglaries, but has not gone down too well with local residents, who criticised it as patronising and intrusive.       
	Shirley Partridge, 75, said: I dont want police officers coming into my house and bellowing at me with a megaphone telling me to lock my windows and doors.    
	Free play    
	 London (AP): Coldplay members say they will reward recession-weary fans by giving away a free CD at all their shows this year. The band says it will give away the disc, LeftRightLeftRightLeft, at all shows starting with the first date of Coldplays North American tour in West Palm Beach, Florida, on May 15. Tickets for that show start at about $60. The nine-track disc will also be available as a free download from the bands website starting the same day. It was recorded over the past year in various cities and includes the tracks Clocks and Viva La Vida.

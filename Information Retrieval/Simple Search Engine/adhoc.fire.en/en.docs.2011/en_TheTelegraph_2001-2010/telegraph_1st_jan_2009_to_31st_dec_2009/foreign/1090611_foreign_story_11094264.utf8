The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Chaos in London after Tube strike
                                                                                                               Chaos in London after Tube strike
          AMIT ROY                              
	London, June 10: Underground train workers in London caused misery for millions of office workers today by staging a 48-hour strike which began at 7 pm last night in an effort to improve on already generous pay and conditions.        
	People queued for hours to get on to overcrowds buses, while others tried to make it either by walking or cycling. Many motorists chose to drive in although car parks were full and traffic moved even more slowly than usual.        
	One Indian advertising executive, who is employed by an Asian weekly, said: I have parking but it took me three hours to drive in. Normally, the journey takes an hour.        
	The cost to the British economy, struggling through the worst recession in living memory, was severe since a significant proportion of workers found they just could not get in or chose to take a day off.         
	Unlike Calcutta, which still has only one underground line, London has an extensive network which stills gets seriously overcrowded during the morning and evening rush hours. But a half hour journey by Tube could easily take between two and three hours by bus or taxi.        
	Most Londoners now use Oyster cards to make their Underground travel cost effective but Indian visitors, now in London to escape the summer heat back home, can scarcely believe the minimum charge for a single ticket is Pound4.        
	This makes London probably the most expensive city in the world for public transport but the unions appear not to be concerned. The result is that people now prefer to hop on to a bus if they can avoid taking an Underground train.         
	A bus is not cheap for a single ticket costs Pound2 but a husband, wife and two children making a return trip to London to look at the galleries or museums, for example, would pay at least Pound32 in fares on the Tube, compared with half that amount on the buses.         
	Today, there was a reasonable service on the Northern Line but there were only intermittent shuttle services by bus on the District, Jubilee, Victoria, Metropolitan and Piccadilly lines. All other lines were suspended and Tube stations across the capital were closed.        
	The bandh culture, invented by Calcutta, now appears to have been bequeathed to London. Here, it is not unusual to see group of five or six workers gossiping and generally not doing anything even though there might be a long queue of passengers waiting patiently in line for tickets being sold by only one employee. This is not to say workers may not have genuine grievances but the strike has become almost the weapon of first resort.         
	Managements find it almost impossible to sack an employee for fear of risking walkouts. Social arrangements were disrupted, too, by todays dispute. The wife of an Indian peer was frustrated by her inability to travel from her South London residence across town to a luncheon appointment at a restaurant in Gloucester Road in the western part of the capital.        
	I dont know how to get there, she said.        
	Soccer fans heading to Wembley for tonights World Cup game between England and Andorra were told that overground rail services would not be stopping close to the stadium because of the strike by Tube workers. London Midland said it feared overcrowding as fans sought alternative ways of getting to North-West London for the World Cup qualifier.        
	The Mayor of London, Boris Johnson, who showed solidarity with commuters by queuing for a ferry, said the strike was unnecessary and misery-making for travellers and urged the Rail Maritime and Transport (RMT) union to return to negotiations. At 6.59 pm last night, Underground workers had walked out.        
	Banker Adam Tibbalds, 38, who took a slow ferry from Embankment to his office in Canary Wharf, summed up the mood of Londoners: All the tubes are messed up so its going to take me longer. It does come across as a bit greedy at the moment to ask for a pay rise when every body else is taking pay freezes. I think they have misjudged what the public opinion of that might be.        
	London Underground drivers are now on Pound40,000 a year, which university teaching staff often do not earn. Others who are barely literate earn almost as much.

	Nicoles man    
	 Nashville, Nov. 12: A glamorous-looking Nicole Kidmans presence at the Country Music Awards did not stop her husband Keith Urban losing out to Taylor Swift as the star of the night, reports The Daily Telegraph.      
	Kidman, in a revealing red dress, watched as Urban was pipped to three awards by the 19-year-old Swift, who beat him to the Best Album, Best Music Video and Entertainer of the Year awards.      
	Kidman consoled her husband by blowing him a kiss from the front row as he performed his hit single Til Summer Comes Around on stage.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Nepal House to elect PM on Saturday
                                                                                                               Nepal House to elect PM on Saturday
                            
	Kathmandu, May 21 (Reuters): Nepals parliament will elect a new Prime Minister at the weekend, a spokesman said today, ending weeks of political crisis sparked by the resignation of Maoist Prime Minister Prachanda.        
	The announcement came a day after the US and EU countries urged Nepals feuding parties to quickly form a new government. Prachanda quit early in May after his move to fire the army chief was vetoed by the President. He will address the House tomorrow.        
	Parliament spokesman Mukunda Sharma said an all-party committee, including the Maoists, had agreed to hold the election for the new Prime Minister at 0915 hours GMT on Saturday.

	 London, Dec. 20 (PTI): Actress Jennifer Lopez has said that motherhood has made her complacent and she is no longer a monster when it comes to exercise.

	 London (PTI): Eight per cent of women buy clothes knowing they would never wear them, a study has shown. The survey, which interviewed 1,623 women aged 18 to 30 in Britain, also found that 91 per cent of women have an item in their cupboard that still has the tags on. The survey found women also hold on to clothes they know are too small for them.

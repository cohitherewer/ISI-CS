The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | US airport bus driver held for plot   FBI silent on potential target 
                                                                                                               US airport bus driver held for plot     -  FBI silent on potential target 
          DAVID JOHNSTON AND WILLIAM K. RASHBAUM                            (Top) Mohammed Wali Zazi with FBI personnel; his son Najibullah. (AP, File picture)                                       
	Sept. 20: FBI agents arrested an airport shuttle bus driver and his father in Colorado and another man in New York City on Saturday night, charging them with lying to investigators about an alleged terrorist plot to detonate an improvised explosive against an unknown target in America.        
	Acting swiftly late Saturday after a week in which investigators worked intensely in New York and Denver to put together a case, the agents arrested Najibullah Zazi, 24, his father, Mohammed Wali Zazi, 53, who both reside in Aurora, Colorado, and Ahmad Wais Afzali, 37, who lives in Flushing, Queens.         
	The Zazis and Afzali are from Afghanistan. The elder Zazi is a naturalised citizen, while Afzalie and the younger Zazi are legal immigrants.        
	The arrests indicated the case was rapidly accelerating and provided for the first time  in a sometimes confusing week of events  an explanation of why authorities were investigating the men and provided details about the alleged plot still under investigation in the US, Pakistan and elsewhere.        
	In a statement issued on Sunday, David Kris, the chief of the Justice Departments national security division, said: The arrests carried out tonight are part of an ongoing and fast-paced investigation. It is important to note that we have no specific information regarding the timing, location or target of any planned attack.         
	Affidavits filed in the case said that during a search of the younger Zazis rental car on September 11, agents found a laptop computer that contained an image of nine pages of handwritten notes. The notes, according to affidavit, contain formulations and instructions regarding the manufacture and handling of initiating explosives, main explosives charges, explosives detonators and components of a fusing system.        
	Last Wednesday, the affidavits said, when agents interviewed Zazi in Denver, he falsely said he had never seen the handwritten notes and told the officers he had not written the notes. In two additional interviews on Thursday and Friday, Zazi told agents that during a 2008 trip to Pakistan, he attended courses and received instruction on weapons and explosives at an al Qaida training camp in a tribal area.        
	The affidavits also said that the elder Zazi and Afzali, who was said to have been a source for the New York Police Department, also lied to investigators about their conversations concerning the younger Zazi and their knowledge of his activities.         
	 Government officials said the charges, which carry a maximum penalty of eight years in prison, were preliminary and were likely to be followed by an indictment with more detailed accusations as the investigation continues.        
	Wendy S. Aiello, a spokesperson for Arthur Folsom, the lawyer representing the Zazis, said: Their attorney is with them.        
	The Denver Post reported Zazi said in a telephone interview that he had not admitted any link to al Qaida, to participation in insurgency training in Pakistan or to involvement in a terrorist plot.

	Hooked on Coke    
	 London, Feb. 21: A Croatian man claims he has drunk nothing but Coca-Cola for the past 40 years  because he promised his mother he would not touch alcohol, reports The Daily Telegraph.       
	Pero Ajtman, 71, said he promised his mother he would stop drinking alcoholic beverages four decades ago. My mum didnt like me drinking when I was a young man as she was very religious, he explained to the Croatian tabloid 24 Sata. She made me promise never to drink again and Coca-Cola was the only thing that tasted as good as wine so I started drinking that. Now I have a glass in the morning, before and after lunch, with my dinner and then before I go to bed. I never drink anything else.    
	Lobster pity    
	New York: A Japanese restaurant in New York has taken pity on a 140-year-old lobster and said that it would not end its days boiled in a pot but instead swim free in the Atlantic Ocean, reports The Daily Telegraph. On Saturday, the venerable crustacean, named Craig, will leave the acquarium at the Halu Japanese Restaurant amp; Grill in Brooklyn, where it has been on display, and head north.     
	Tank joyride    
	 Berlin (AP): Police say one joyride in a light tank wasnt enough for a drunken British soldier in Germany. Police in Celle say the 18-year-old stole a small light tank early on Friday and rumbled out of his base towards nearby Bergen - but drove off the road after 500 metres. Undaunted, he walked back to his base and commandeered a second tank.

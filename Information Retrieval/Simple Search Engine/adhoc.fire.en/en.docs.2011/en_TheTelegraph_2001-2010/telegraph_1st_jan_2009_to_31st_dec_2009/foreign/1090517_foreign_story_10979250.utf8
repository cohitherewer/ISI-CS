	Peshawar, May 16 (Reuters): A car packed with mortar bombs blew up on a busy street in Peshawar today, 11 hours after a suspected US drone aircraft fired missiles at militants in another region and killed 10.        
	The blast blew up a passing school bus and city police chief Sifwat Ghayyur said four children and two women were among the dead. It was a remote controlled bomb, Ghayyur said.        
	There was no claim of responsibility for the blast but government officials have warned of the danger of militant bomb attacks in response to the offensive against the Taliban in their Swat bastion.        
	Earlier, a suspected US drone aircraft fired missiles at militants in the North Waziristan ethnic Pashtun tribal region, on the Afghan border to the southwest of Peshawar.

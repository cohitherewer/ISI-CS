	Washington, Nov. 3 (AP): President Barack Obamas Democrats faced the possibility of symbolic setbacks as voting began today to elect governors in the states of New Jersey and Virginia.        
	Beyond the immediate outcome of the elections, results in those races and a handful of other contests nationwide will go under the microscope as the nations political class looks for clues about the future direction of the country.        
	They will examine whether there are chances that Obamas Democrats will retain power in the 2010 mid-term vote or signs of a resurgence among wobbly Republicans.        
	 Traditionally, mid-term voting works in favour of the party out of power as the President hits the midway point in his term and voters begin feeling dissatisfaction with their representation in Congress.        
	 In the few races of consequence this year, late polls in New Jersey showed incumbent Democratic Governor Jon Corzine in a too-close-to-predict race against Republican Chris Christie, a former prosecutor, despite a series of campaign appearances for Corzine by Obama.        
	Corruption in state government and highest-in-the-nation state taxes have dragged down Corzine, who also has not been helped by his past background as chairman and chief executive officer of Wall Street giant Goldman Sachs.        
	Republicans have not won statewide in New Jersey in a dozen years, and a victory would sting the President in a state he carried a year ago.        
	Democrats appear more certain to face disappointment in Virginia, where Obama won the presidential vote last year to become the first Democrat to do that since 1964. The incumbent governor, Tim Kaine, is also chairman of the Democratic National Committee, but was barred by a state term-limit law from seeking re-election.        
	Democrat Creigh Deeds trails Republican Bob McDonnell in polls by double digits. Obama also campaigned for Deeds, but as his support buckled, the White House began saying it had done all it could and pointing to polls that showed the Democrats likely loss would not reflect on the presidents popularity.        
	Voters also will decide ballot measures in a number of states. In Maine there is a referendum on gay marriage, whether to accept or reject a same-sex marriage law approved by legislators in May.        
	In Washington, voters will decide whether to keep a legislature-approved everything but marriage domestic partnerships law, which grants registered partners the same rights as married couples.

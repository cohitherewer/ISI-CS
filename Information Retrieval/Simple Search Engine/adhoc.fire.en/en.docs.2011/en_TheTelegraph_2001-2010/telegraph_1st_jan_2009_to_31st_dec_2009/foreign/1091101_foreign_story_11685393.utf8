	London, Oct. 31: The Tweance, the Twitter sance, has reported that Michael Jackson is at peace, and Kurt Cobain thinks Dave Grohl is a good drummer.        
	 The Halloween publicity stunt, carried out by psychic Jayne Wallace on behalf of a London fancy dress store, also claimed to have contacted Kurt Cobain and River Phoenix.        
	 Nonetheless, the insights were truly startling. Cobains ghost revealed to Wallace and her psychic sisters that Dave Grohl is a good drummer.        
	The big draw, of course, was Jackson. According to Wallace his spirit was singing Heal the World when contacted. His shade apologised for letting down his fans by not carrying out the This Is It tour, but stopped short of offering to reimburse anyone.

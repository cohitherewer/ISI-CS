The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Nepal hauls army chief for defying orders
                                                                                                               Nepal hauls army chief for defying orders
          J. HEMANTH                           General Katuwal                                  
	Kathmandu, April 20: The strained relations between the Nepal Army and the Maoist-led coalition worsened today after the defence ministry asked the army chief to explain why he has been defying government orders recently.        
	In a show-cause notice, the ministry said it wanted the explanation in 24 hours and warned that army chief General Rukmangat Katuwal would face the consequences if he failed to respond within the stipulated time.         
	The notice was sent to the army headquarters this morning. The ministrys ultimatum comes a day after some senior ministers agreed to the Maoists proposal to put pressure on the army and bring it under the governments full control. Among those who endorsed the move were ministers from the Communist Party of Nepal (Unified Marxist-Leninist) which is the second largest group in the ruling coalition.         
	The notice seeks a clarification from Katuwal as to why he had asked eight brigadier generals to join office while their retirement case was still pending in the Supreme Court. The ministry also wants to know why the army decided to boycott the Fifth National Games and defied governments orders to stop the recruitment process.         
	Senior Maoist leaders told The Telegraph here that the government had, in principle, decided to sack Katuwal if his response to the notice was found unsatisfactory. Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal invited General Katuwal for talks yesterday and asked him to resign and take up the job of National Security Adviser. Alternatively the Prime Minister offered him an ambassadorial posting, the leaders said.

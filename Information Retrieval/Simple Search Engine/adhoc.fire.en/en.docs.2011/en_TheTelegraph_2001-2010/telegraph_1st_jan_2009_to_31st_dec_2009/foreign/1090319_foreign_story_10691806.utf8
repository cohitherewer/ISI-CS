	Washington, March 18: President Obama and his national security advisers are considering expanding the American covert war in Pakistan far beyond the unruly tribal areas to strike at a different centre of Taliban power in Baluchistan.        
	Top Taliban leaders have been orchestrating attacks into southern Afghanistan from Baluchistan.         
	According to senior administration officials, two of the high-level reports on Pakistan and Afghanistan that have been forwarded to the White House in recent weeks have called for broadening the target area to include a major insurgent sanctuary in and around the city of Quetta.         
	Mullah Muhammad Omar, who led the Taliban government that was ousted in the American-led invasion in 2001, has operated with near impunity out of the region for years, along with many of his deputies.         
	The extensive missile strikes being carried out by the CIA-operated drones have until now been limited to the tribal areas, and have never been extended into Baluchistan, a sprawling province that is under the authority of the central government. It abuts the parts of southern Afghanistan where recent fighting has been the fiercest.         
	Fear remains within the American government that extending the raids would worsen tensions. Pakistan complains that the strikes violate its sovereignty. But some American officials say the strikes in the tribal areas have forced some leaders of the Taliban and al Qaida to flee south towards Quetta, making them more vulnerable. In separate reports, groups led by both General David H. Petraeus, commander of American forces in the region, and Lieutenant General Douglas E. Lute, a top White House official on Afghanistan, have recommended expanding American operations outside the tribal areas.        
	Many of Obamas advisers are also urging him to sustain orders issued last summer by President George W. Bush to continue Predator drone attacks against a wider range of targets in the tribal areas.        
	They also are recommending preserving the option to conduct cross-border ground actions, using CIA and Special Operations commandos, as was done in September. Bushs orders also named as targets a wide variety of insurgents seeking to topple Pakistans government. Obama has said little in public about how broadly he wants to pursue those groups.        
	A spokesman for the National Security Council, Mike Hammer, declined to provide details, saying: Were still working hard to finalise the review on Afghanistan and Pakistan that the President requested.        
	No other officials would talk on the record about the issue, citing the administrations continuing internal deliberations and the politically volatile nature of strikes into Pakistani territory.        
	It is fair to say that there is wide agreement to sustain and continue these covert programmes, said one senior administration official. One of the foundations on which the recommendations to the President will be based is that weve got to sustain the disruption of the safe havens.

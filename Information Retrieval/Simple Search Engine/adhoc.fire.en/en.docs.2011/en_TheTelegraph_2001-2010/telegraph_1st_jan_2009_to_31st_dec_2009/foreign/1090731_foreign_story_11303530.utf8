The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Pervez case turned down
                                                                                                               Pervez case turned down
                              Chaudhry: No authority                            
	Islamabad, July 30 (Reuters): Pakistans top judge turned down a request today to launch a treason case against former President Pervez Musharraf, saying the Supreme Court lacked the authority.        
	However, Chief Justice Iftikhar Chaudhry said Musharraf can be tried for treason by parliament. Chaudhrys remarks could reassure both the fragile civilian government and military establishment, as they can ill-afford any fresh crisis at a time when the country is fighting a Taliban insurgency in parts of the northwest. This is not the proper forum to initiate such case. We are not authorised to do so, Chaudhry told the court.        
	Musharraf was forced to quit as President almost a year ago to avoid impeachment and has been living in London for the past two months.         
	Hamid Khan, a lawyer who was at the forefront of a movement to oust Musharraf, asked a panel of 14 judges led by Chaudhry to begin treason proceedings on grounds that the general had seized power in a coup in 1999 and violated the Constitution to extend his rule in 2007.         
	The court last week ordered Musharraf to explain allegations that he appointed new judges under emergency rule in violation of the Constitution.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | US eases Cuba travel restrictions
                                                                                                               US eases Cuba travel restrictions
                            
	Washington, April 13 (Reuters): President Barack Obama opened a crack today in a decades-old US embargo against communist Cuba, allowing American telecommunications firms to start providing service for Cubans and lifting restrictions on family ties to the island.        
	In a major shift from the Bush administrations hard-line approach to Havana, Obama ended limits on family travel and money transfers to their homeland by Cubans in the US. The moves by the White House do not eliminate Washingtons trade embargo against Cuba, set up 47 years ago, but they do hold out the prospect for improving relations between the two foes.        
	The President has directed that a series of steps be taken to reach out to the Cuban people to support their desire to enjoy basic human rights, said White House spokesman Robert Gibbs. These are actions he has taken to open up the flow of information.

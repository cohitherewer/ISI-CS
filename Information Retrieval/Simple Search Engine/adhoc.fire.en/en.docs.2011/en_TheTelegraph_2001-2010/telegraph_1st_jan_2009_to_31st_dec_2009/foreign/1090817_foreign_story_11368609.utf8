          RACHEL L. SWARNS                          The White House                                  
	Washington, Aug. 16: In 1809, a young boy from a wealthy Virginia estate stepped into President James Madisons White House and caught the first glimpse of his new home.         
	The East Room was unfinished, he recalled years later in a memoir. Pennsylvania Avenue was unpaved and always in an awful condition from either mud or dust, he recounted. The city was a dreary place, he continued.         
	His name was Paul Jennings, and he was an unlikely chronicler of the Madison presidency. When he first walked into the Executive Mansion, he was a 10-year-old slave.         
	But over the course of his long life, Jennings witnessed, and perhaps participated in, the rescue of George Washingtons portrait from the White House during the War of 1812 and stood by the former Presidents side at his deathbed.         
	He bought his freedom, helped to organise a daring (and unsuccessful) slave escape and became the first person to put his White House recollections into a memoir.         
	Next week, Jenningss story will take centre stage when his descendants gather for a reunion in the White House. Historians say it will be a remarkable moment in the history of the mansion, which was built with slave labour and now houses President Barack Obama, the first black person to hold the office.        
	Historians say the visit will highlight the intimate, day-to-day role that enslaved men and women played in the White House, a community that is little known and whose members have long languished in obscurity.        
	White House curator William G. Allman, said few historical records existed about the black people who lived and worked in the building during its earliest years. Slaves were barred from learning to read and write, and their owners often considered their stories inconsequential.         
	So the accounting of Jenningss life is notable, particularly because he was so closely linked to Madison and to the portrait of George Washington, which is considered the White Houses most valuable historical object. New details about Jenningss life and his family have emerged through the research of Beth Taylor, a research associate at Montpelier, the Madison plantation in Virginia. Over the past two years, Taylor has poured over court records and tracked down and interviewed his descendants, discovering historical documents and the only known photograph of Jennings.        
	She also found a rare edition of Jenningss recollections, which were released in 1865 under the title A Colored Mans Reminiscences of James Madison. In the 19-page memoir, Jennings, who served as a footman and later a valet to Madison, recalled the chaotic escape from the White House hours before the British burned the building in 1814.         
	He described Madison as a frugal and temperate man who owned only one suit, socialised with Thomas Jefferson and was so careful with his liquor that he probably never drank a quart of brandy in his whole life.        
	Jennings said he often served and shaved the President and recalled that his master was kind to his slaves. He was 48 when he finally bought his freedom, years after Madisons death in 1836.        
	As a free man, Jennings worked in the governments pension office and even helped support former First Lady Dolley Madison with small sums from my own pocket when she fell on hard times.        
	Jennings, who died in 1874 at the age of 75, did not discuss his personal difficulties in his memoir, but Taylor and others said he encountered many hardships.         
	As a slave, he was forced to live apart from his wife and children. And he seemed to have chafed under Dolleys ownership after her husband died.        
	Articles in abolitionist newspapers uncovered by researchers at the University of Virginias Dolley Madison Digital Edition, an online collection of the former First Ladys correspondence, reported that she treated her slaves poorly.

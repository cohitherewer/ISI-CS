The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | US had evicted illegal Theron
                                                                                                               US had evicted illegal Theron
                              Visa woes                            
	London, Sept. 16 (PTI): Oscar-winning actress Charlize Theron has revealed that she was briefly thrown out of US because she was working illegally in Hollywood.         
	The South Africa-born actress, who became an American citizen in 2007, initially outstayed her welcome in the US while her career was taking off after her breakthrough role in Two Days In The Valley.        
	As her work visa expired, Theron landed a role opposite Al Pacino and Keanu Reeves in The Devils Advocate when immigration officials caught up with her.        
	I had to hold out for two years after playing the femme fatale in Two Days In The Valley because people wanted me to play that role. I think there was a conscious effort on my part to hold back and I didnt work for two years and I waited and really fought for roles in The Devils Advocate and The Yards, Cider House Rules, the 34-year-old actress said.         
	She was in a bad state, literally fighting for roles in Hollywood and struggled to find work when she was kicked out.         
	I went out on auditions and flew myself out (for movies) and almost went to prison and didnt wash my hair to break this idea of what people thought of me. I was deported when I was making Devils Advocate, but that will be for my book one day, Theron added.

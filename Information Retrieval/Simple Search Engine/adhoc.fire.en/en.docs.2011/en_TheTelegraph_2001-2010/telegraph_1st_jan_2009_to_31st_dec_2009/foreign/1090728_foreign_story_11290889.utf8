                              Cunningham                            
	New York, July 27 (Reuters): US choreographer and dancer Merce Cunningham, credited by many with revolutionising visual and performing arts, has died at age 90, his dance company said today.        
	Cunningham, whose long-time partner was the late composer John Cage, died peacefully at home yesterday of natural causes, the Cunningham Dance Foundation said today.        
	Born in Centralia, Washington, Cunningham trained in dance and theatre at the Cornish College of the Arts in Seattle and from 1939 to 1945 was a dancer with the Martha Graham Dance Company. He formed the Merce Cunningham Dance Company in 1953.

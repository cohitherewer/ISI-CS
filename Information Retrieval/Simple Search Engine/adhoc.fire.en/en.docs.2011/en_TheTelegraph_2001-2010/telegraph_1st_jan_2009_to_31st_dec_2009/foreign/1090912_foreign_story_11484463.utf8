The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Senior Taliban leader held: Pak
                                                                                                               Senior Taliban leader held: Pak
          JANE PERLEZ AND PIR ZUBAIR SHAH                          Muslim Khan                                  
	Mingora, Sept. 11: The Pakistani Army announced today that security forces have arrested a senior leader of the Taliban in the troubled area of Swat where the military has largely put down a militant insurgency.        
	The arrest of Muslim Khan, the spokesman of the Taliban in Swat and a skilled public advocate for the militant cause, is the first capture of a senior leader to be officially announced by the Pakistani authorities.        
	The announcement appeared to be timed for the eighth anniversary of the terrorist attacks on New York and Washington, and to impress the Obama administration with the seriousness of the military endeavour here in Swat.        
	Senior American commanders have complimented the Pakistani military in recent weeks on their operation in Swat, even as the Americans urge the Pakistani Army to extend its operations to Waziristan where Taliban militants cross into Afghanistan to fight Nato-led forces.        
	 Khan was arrested along with Mahmood Khan, a less senior commander, and three others, the statement by Interservices Public Relations, the press department of the Pakistani military said.        
	The statement did not say when Khan was arrested. There were some suggestions from officials that Khan was arrested some days ago and the announcement was delayed for the 9/11 anniversary.        
	Khan was often seen on Pakistani television sitting on the floor of his office, dressed in a shawl and salwar kameez with a long flowing grey beard. Unlike most Taliban fighters, he spoke reasonable English with an American accent, acquired during several years in the US. He was deported from America after the attacks on September 11, 2001.        
	He was the one who was very polite, not harsh, said Rashid Iqbal, a journalist in Swat, and editor of the daily newspaper Chaand. Khan was not religious or particularly interested in Islam, Iqbal said. It was only power.        
	The arrest of Khan comes after bitter complaints from the civilians in Swat that the top leaders of the Taliban remain at large. More than a million residents were ordered to leave Swat in May, and they endured more than two months of life in miserable conditions in camps for the displaced in North-West Frontier Province. They started returning in mid-July to find the Taliban gone from the main town, Mingora, but its leadership apparently still intact.        
	The whereabouts of the leader of the Swat Taliban, Maulvi Fazullah, is not known according to military officials.

	97 and jumping    
	 London, April 5: A 97-year-old daredevil has jumped from an aircraft in his first ever skydive, reports The Sunday Telegraph.      
	George Moyse jumped from a plane at 10,000ft with his instructors above an airfield in Wiltshire. The pensioner, from Dorset carried out the stunt to raise money for the Royal National Lifeboat Institution, a charity that saves lives at sea around the coasts of the British Isles.       
	After the jump Moyse said: It was lovely, I really enjoyed it, I wasnt frightened at all. It was the first time but it wont be the last.       
	He said: I do not sit around. I get about, I go for a walk every day and I do my own cooking, washing, ironing, everything. I have just been lucky to be so agile.     
	Toothpaste thief    
	 Berlin (Reuters): Police in northern Germany are searching for a man who tried to walk out of a supermarket with 68 tubes of toothpaste stuffed into his clothing. Noticing his bulging jacket, a store worker grabbed the man when he refused to stop and the tubes of toothpaste spilled all over the floor. The thief struck the woman in the face and ran out.

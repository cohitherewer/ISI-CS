The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Indonesia voters retreat from radical Islam

	Jakarta, April 25: From Pakistan to Gaza and Lebanon, militant Islamic movements have gained ground rapidly in recent years, fanning western fears of a consolidation of radical Muslim governments.         
	But here in the worlds most populous Muslim nation just the opposite is happening, with Islamic parties suffering a steep drop in popular support. In parliamentary elections this month, voters punished Islamic parties that focused narrowly on religious issues, and even the parties best efforts to appeal to the countrys mainstream failed to sway the public.         
	The largest Islamic party, the Prosperous Justice Party, ran television commercials of young women without head scarves and distributed pamphlets in the colours of the countrys major secular parties. But the party fell far short of its goal of garnering 15 per cent of the vote, squeezing out a gain of less than one percentage point over its 7.2 per cent showing in 2004.         
	That was a big letdown for a party and a movement that had grown phenomenally in recent years, even as more radical elements directed terrorist attacks against Western tourists and targets. The party had projected that it would double its share of seats in Parliament even as it stuck to its founding goal of bringing Shariah, or Islamic law, to Indonesia, the worlds fourth most populous nation, with 240 million people.        
	Altogether, the major Islamic parties suffered a drop in support from 38 per cent in 2004 to less than 26 percent this year, according to the Indonesian Survey Institute, an independent polling firm whose figures are in keeping with partial official results. Political experts and politicians attribute the decline to voters disillusionment with Islamic parties that once called for idealism, but became embroiled in the messy, often corrupt world of Indonesian politics.         
	They also say that the popular President, Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono, who is expected to be re-elected in July, appropriated the largest Islamic partys signature theme of clean government through a far-reaching anticorruption drive. On a deeper level, some of the parties fundamentalist measures seem to have alienated moderate Indonesians.         
	While Indonesia has a long tradition of moderation, it was badly destabilised with the end of military rule in 1998, which gave rise to Islamist politicians who preached righteousness and to some hard-core elements, who practiced violence.

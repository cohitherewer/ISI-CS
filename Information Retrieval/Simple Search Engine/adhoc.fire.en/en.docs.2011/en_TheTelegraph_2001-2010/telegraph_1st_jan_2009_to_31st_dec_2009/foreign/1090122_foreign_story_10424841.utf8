The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Guantanamo clock ticks
                                                                                                               Guantanamo clock ticks
                      
	Washington, Jan. 21 (Reuters): President Barack Obama would order the US prison at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, to be closed within one year if he signs a draft order obtained by Reuters today.        
	His administration would also start an immediate review on how to deal with the remaining prisoners, the order shows.        
	Obama had pledged during his election campaign to shut down the Guantanamo prison camp. The camp had been seen as a stain on the US human rights record and a symbol of detainee abuse and detention without charge under the Bush administration.        
	The unsigned draft calls for a series of reviews on the status of the prisoners at Guantanamo and the military commissions set up to try them. The review will also investigate transferring prisoners to facilities in the US.                  Detainees cling to a fence at a camp in the Guantanamo Bay Naval Base in Cuba. (AP)       
	The detention facilities at Guantanamo for individuals covered by this order shall be closed as soon as practicable, and no later than one year from the date of this order, the draft said.        
	Anyone covered by the order who is still in detention when the prison is closed shall be returned to their home country, released, transferred to a third country, or transferred to another United States detention facility, the draft said.        
	A senior US official said Obama was unlikely to sign and issue the order on his first day in office. It is expected soon, however. The draft includes January in the dateline but leaves the day of signature open.        
	The order says it is in the US foreign policy and national security interests to close the controversial prison and deal with the remaining prisoners.        
	9/11 trial halted         
	A US military judge today halted the trial of five prisoners accused of plotting the September 11 attacks, giving Obama the time he sought to decide whether to scrap the Guantanamo war crimes tribunals.        
	Hours after taking office, Obama ordered prosecutors in the Guantanamo court to ask for a 120-day halt in all pending cases. He asked for time to review the cases and decide what forum best suits any future prosecution.

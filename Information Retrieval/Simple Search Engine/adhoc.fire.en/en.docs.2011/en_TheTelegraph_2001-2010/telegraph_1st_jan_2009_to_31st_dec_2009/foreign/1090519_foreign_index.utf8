                                                                                                                                          Sri Lanka declared total victory today in one of the worlds most intractable wars, after killing the separatist Tamil Tigers leader and taking control of the entire country for the first time since 1983.                 The Sri Lankan army has claimed that Prabhakaran was killed while trying to escape but questions abound over the war without witness in the island nation.                             A picture released by the Sri Lankan army shows the body of Prabhakarans son Charles Anthony.

                              Power play                            
	Islamabad, Dec. 21 (Reuters): Pakistans main Opposition party said today it would not support any unconstitutional action against President Asif Ali Zardari or his government but warned of protests if Zardari did not give up some powers.        
	Political tension has been running high in Pakistan since last week when the Supreme Court threw out an amnesty that protected him, several government ministers and thousands of others from corruption charges.        
	Zardari has faced some calls to resign but he has rejected them. He and his ruling party issued a defiant statement on the weekend, saying no members of the government would resign and condemning what they called a witch-hunt against them.        
	Several of Zardaris aides and two of his top ministers  interior minister Rehman Malik and defence minister Chaudhry Ahmed Mukhtar  were also on a list of people protected by the amnesty, and they too are facing calls to quit.        
	While some members of the main Opposition party, led by former Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif, have called for Zardari and the two ministers to step down, the party has been circumspect.        
	A Pakistan Muslim League (Nawaz) spokesman said the party felt it was the moral duty of Zardari and the two ministers to step down, but it was up to them. If Zardari and his ministers, who were covered by the amnesty, do not resign, thats completely up to them, he said.

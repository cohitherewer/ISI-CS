	Baikonur (Kazakhstan), March 26 (Reuters): US billionaire Charles Simonyi roared into space aboard a Russian rocket today, making history as the first tourist to make the epic journey twice.        
	The Soyuz TMA-14 spacecraft blasted into the leaden skies from the Baikonur cosmodrome in Kazakhstan at 1149 GMT as planned. We are feeling well. Everything is going well, Russian cosmonaut Gennady Padalka said in a live feed after take-off.

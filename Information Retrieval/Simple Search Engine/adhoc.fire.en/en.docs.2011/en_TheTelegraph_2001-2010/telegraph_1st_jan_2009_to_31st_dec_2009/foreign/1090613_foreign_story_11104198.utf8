	Star slam    
	 London (PTI): Hollywood star Jennifer Aniston has slammed US tabloid reports that said she enjoyed a secret meeting with her ex-husband Brad Pitt. The former couple, who split in 2005, reportedly reunited recently in an intimate rendezvous at New York citys Gramercy Park Hotel according to US tabloid Star. The reports fuelled break-up rumours between Pitt and partner Angelina Jolie. Pitt has denied the rumours, and now Anistons spokesperson has stepped in to blast the allegations, calling the story a complete fabrication.

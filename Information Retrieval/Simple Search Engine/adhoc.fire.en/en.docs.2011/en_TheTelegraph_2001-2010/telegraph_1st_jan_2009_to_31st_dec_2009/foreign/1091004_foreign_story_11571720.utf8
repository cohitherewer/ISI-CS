The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Iran chiefs Jewish roots
                                                                                                               Iran chiefs Jewish roots
          DAMIEN MCELROY AND AHMAD VAHDAT                           Ahmadinejad                                  
	London, Oct. 3: Mahmoud Ahmadinejads vitriolic attacks on the Jewish world hide an astonishing secret, evidence uncovered by The Daily Telegraph shows.         
	A photograph of the Iranian President holding up his identity card during elections in March 2008 clearly shows his family has Jewish roots.         
	A close-up of the document reveals he was previously known as Sabourjian  a Jewish name meaning cloth weaver.         
	The short note scrawled on the card suggests his family changed its name to Ahmadinejad when they converted to Islam after his birth.         
	The Sabourjians traditionally hail from Aradan, Ahmadinejads birthplace, and the name derives from the Jewish for weaver of the Sabour, the name for the Jewish Tallit shawl in Persia. The name is even on the list of reserved names for Iranian Jews compiled by Irans interior ministry.         
	Experts last night suggested Ahmadinejads track record for hate-filled attacks on Jews could be an overcompensation to hide his past.         
	Ali Nourizadeh, of the Centre for Arab and Iranian Studies, said: This aspect of Mr Ahmadinejads background explains a lot about him.         
	Every family that converts into a different religion takes a new identity by condemning their old faith.         
	By making anti-Israeli statements he is trying to shed any suspicions about his Jewish connections. He feels vulnerable in a radical Shia society.         
	A London-based expert on Iranian Jewry said that jian ending to the name showed the family had been practising Jews. He has changed his name for religious reasons, or at least his parents had, he said.         
	The Iranian leader has not denied his name was changed when his family moved to Tehran in the 1950s. But he has never revealed what it was changed from or directly addressed the reason for the switch.                     THE DAILY TELEGRAPH

	Colombo, Feb. 21 (Reuters): The Tamil Tiger rebels today called a defiant air raid on the Sri Lankan capital a success, despite the planes missing their stated targets the night before.        
	The surprise attack late yesterday by two small Tiger air craft set off hails of anti-aircraft fire across Colombo. One slammed into the main government tax office in central Colombo, killing at least two people and wounding 53, the military said.        
	The other plane was shot down and crashed in a marsh outside the international airport  site of the Tiger air wings first strike in 2007. State TV showed triumphant soldiers around the bullet-riddled fuselage of the small plane and its dead pilot.        
	The attack was the latest proof of the Tigers ability to strike far from the war zone, where troops have rapidly encircled them in just 87 sqkm of jungle and are within reach of ending a separatist war that began in 1983. The LTTE in a news release said the raid targeted Sri Lankas air force headquarters in Colombo and airbase at the international airport, pro-rebel website www.TamilNet.com reported.        
	TamilNet said the mission was flown by Black Air Tigers, or suicide pilots, and said they had carried out successful air raids. The military said each plane was carrying more than 200kg of C-4 explosives. Both planes came close to their targets. The tax office is near air force headquarters, and the crash site of the other was near the boundary of the airbase.        
	TamilNet showed the men it said were the pilots smiling, with Tiger leader Vellupillai Prabhakaran standing in the middle with his arms around them. The website said the picture was taken before the mission, but did not give a specific time. Yesterdays raid also showed that Sri Lankas military could down planes from a ramshackle air squadron.

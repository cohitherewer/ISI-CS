The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Pak frees 12 Swat militants
                                                                                                               Pak frees 12 Swat militants
                            
	Mingora, March 8 (Reuters): Pakistani authorities have released 12 Taliban militants in a bid to consolidate a pact struck last month with Islamists in the troubled northwestern Swat valley, a senior government official said today.        
	Their release is likely to deepen concerns among western countries which say the policy of making pacts with Islamists is tantamount to appeasement and emboldens the militants.        
	US officials fear the deal in Swat may create another safe haven for al Qaida and the Taliban on Pakistani soil.        
	The Taliban militants were released yesterday night after talks between North West Frontier Province authorities and representatives of the Taliban and the Islamists, officials said.        
	It was one of the demands of the Taliban. It was a goodwill gesture. We have fulfilled it and we hope now they will play their part for peace, Syed Mohammad Javed, the commissioner of Swat, said.

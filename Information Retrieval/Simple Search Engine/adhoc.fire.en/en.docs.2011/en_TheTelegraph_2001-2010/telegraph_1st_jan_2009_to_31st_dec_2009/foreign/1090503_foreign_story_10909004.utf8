The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | 64 killed in hospital shelling, says doctor
                                                                                                               64 killed in hospital shelling, says doctor
                            
	Colombo, May 2 (AP): Artillery shells hit a makeshift hospital in Sri Lankas northern war zone today, killing at least 64 civilians, a government doctor and a rebel-linked website said.        
	The TamilNet website accused government forces of shelling the hospital at Mullivaaykkaal.        
	Military spokesman Brigadier Udaya Nanayakkara denied the accusation, saying soldiers were only using small arms as they pushed forward to seize the remaining territory held by separatist Tamil Tigers along a small coastal strip in the islands northeast.        
	A government health official said at least 64 patients and bystanders were killed in two artillery attacks that hit the hospital today.        
	Another 87 were wounded, said the official, who declined to be identified by name because he was not authorised to speak to the media. TamilNet said the shells struck yesterday and today.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Prayers banned at Urumqi mosques

	Urumqi (China), July 10: Chinese authorities banned prayer gatherings at mosques here today as security officials tried to prevent further ethnic violence in the Xinjiang region.         
	But local officials appeared to partly relax the ban this afternoon, allowing shortened prayer services after hundreds of Uighur worshippers gathered outside at least two of Urumqis main mosques and pressed to be allowed inside, news agencies reported.         
	The security clampdown that followed Sundays deadly riots remained tight. A small group of about 40 Uighur men and women began a protest march after prayers ended today, but they were quickly blocked by police forces, The Associated Press reported. Officials later announced a curfew would be reimposed on the city this evening. The citys main bus station was filled with people trying to flee the unrest, news services said.        
	Meanwhile, in another large Xinjiang city, the ancient Silk Road oasis town of Kashgar, foreign journalists and other visitors were instructed to leave. Strictly enforced security was clearly high on the governments agenda, and The Peoples Daily, the Communist Partys official newspaper, said in an editorial today that to maintain social stability, we need to isolate and crack down hard on a handful of people. The paper said those who masterminded, organised and committed serious violence during the riot should be targets.        
	Hike in death toll        
	Chinas state news agency today said the death toll in the rioting had risen from 156 to 184. Xinhua News Agency said the dead included 137 people  111 men and 26 women  from the dominant ethnic Han Chinese group. The other fatalities include 46 Uighurs.

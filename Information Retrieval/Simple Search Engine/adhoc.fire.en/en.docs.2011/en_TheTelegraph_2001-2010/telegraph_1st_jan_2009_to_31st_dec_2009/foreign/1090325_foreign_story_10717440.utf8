The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Chaudhry tells lawyers to root out corruption
                                                                                                               Chaudhry tells lawyers to root out corruption

	Islamabad, March 24: Supreme Court Chief Justice Iftikhar Mohammad Chaudhry today urged lawyers to root out corruption in the judiciary as he returned to work today more than a year after he was sacked by a military ruler.        
	There is rampant corruption in this institution (judiciary) and this cannot be eradicated without the help of lawyers, Chaudhry said in opening remarks in a courtroom packed with lawyers.         
	They sprinkled rose petals on the judge as he arrived at the court to assume his duties. The lawyers released colourful balloons and shouted: We are grateful to Allah the almighty for showing us this day.        
	As the lawyers in the courtroom gave him a standing ovation, Chaudhry said: It is a matter of great satisfaction and a day for thanksgiving to Allah that after a long period, the original court has been restored.         
	He said the lawyers have to continue the struggle for making the judiciary more responsible and honourable.         
	Former President and army chief General Pervez Musharraf dismissed Chaudhry in November 2007 out of fear that the judge would block his re-election as President while still army chief. The outrage many Pakistanis felt over Musharrafs treatment of the judge led to the heavy defeat of the main pro-Musharraf party in a general election in February last year.         
	Despite promises to reinstate Chaudhry and other judges Musharraf dismissed, Zardari dragged his feet. Zardari replaced Musharraf after he was forced to step down last August.        
	Analysts say Zardari, widower of assassinated former Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto, feared a reinstated Chaudhry could nullify an amnesty that Musharraf granted Bhutto and Zardari to enable them to return to Pakistan without fear of prosecution for old charges of corruption. Zardari finally relented and agreed to reinstate the judge in the face of the unrelenting protests and looming turmoil.

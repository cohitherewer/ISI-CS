The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Osamas son dead: Radio
                                                                                                               Osamas son dead: Radio
                            
	Islamabad, July 23 (Reuters): One of Osama bin Ladens sons was probably killed by a US missile strike in Pakistan earlier this year, US National Public Radio reported, citing intelligence sources.        
	An American counter-intelligence official said it was 80 to 85 per cent certain that Saad bin Laden, who was in his twenties, had been killed.        
	The official said the son of the al Qaida leader was not a major figure and would not have been important enough to target but was in the wrong place at the wrong time.        
	It was unknown whether Saad was anywhere near his father when he died, NPR said. A US intelligence official said in January that Saad had been freed from custody in Iran and had probably gone to Pakistan.        
	There have been reports (of his death), but none of them has been confirmed or verified, a senior Pakistani security official said.        
	The US believes Osama bin Laden is hiding in Pakistan. Intelligence agencies have had near misses tracking his deputy Ayman al Zawahri, but the hunt for bin Laden went cold several years ago. While al Qaida often releases audiotaped messages from bin Laden, the last videotape was released two years ago, and there is constant speculation that he might have died.

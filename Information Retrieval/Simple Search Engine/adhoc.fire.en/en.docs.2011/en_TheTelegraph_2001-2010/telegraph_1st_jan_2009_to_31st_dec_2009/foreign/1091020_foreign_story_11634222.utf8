	New York, Oct. 19 (Reuters): Companies trying to market products to mothers need to head onto the Internet with a survey showing the 21st century mother is online daily, using Facebook to connect to friends and Google to diagnose illnesses.        
	A poll by parenting website BabyCenter.com found 63 per cent of online mothers now use social media networks such as Facebook regularly, compared to only 11 per cent three years ago. It found 44 per cent use social media for recommendations on which brands and products to buy with little difference between mothers of different ages.        
	They dont watch TV as much, they are not reading magazines as much, but instead they check Facebook, Twitter ... where people are really drawn together over parenting issues, BabyCenters editor-in-chief Linda Murray said. One of the major activities is looking for recommendations on products.

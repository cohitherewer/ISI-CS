The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Browser pioneer in second war 
                                                                                                               Browser pioneer in second war 
          MIGUEL HELFT                           Marc Andreessen                                  
	San Francisco, Aug. 14: It has been 15 years since Marc Andreessen developed the Netscape browser that introduced millions of people to the Internet.         
	After its early success, Netscape was roundly defeated by Microsoft in the so-called browser wars of the 1990s that dominated the webs first chapter.         
	Andreessen appears to want a rematch. Now a prominent Silicon Valley financier, Andreessen is backing a start-up called RockMelt, staffed with some of his close associates, that is building a new Internet browser, according to people with knowledge of his investment.         
	We have backed a really good team, Andreessen said in an interview earlier this summer. A moment later, Andreessen appeared to regret his comment, saying he was not ready to talk about any aspect of the company.         
	But Andreessen suggested the new browser would be different, saying that most other browsers had not kept pace with the evolution of the web, which had grown from an array of static web pages into a network of complex websites and applications. There are all kinds of things that you would do differently if you are building a browser from scratch, Andreessen said.         
	RockMelt was co-founded by Eric Vishria and Tim Howes, both former executives at Opsware, a company that Andreessen co-founded and then sold to Hewlett-Packard in 2007 for about $1.6 billion. Howes also worked at Netscape with Andreessen.         
	Little else is known about RockMelt, and Vishria was unwilling to discuss it. We are at very early stages of development, Vishria said. Talking about it at this stage is not useful.         
	After Microsoft defeated Netscape, it controlled more than 90 per cent of the browser market. Interest in browsers among technology companies waned and innovation ground to a halt. But in the last 18 months, the Internet browser has become a battleground again with giants like Google , Apple and Microsoft fighting one another.         
	The renewed interest in browsers is partly a result of the success of Mozilla. The speedier, safer and more innovative Mozilla Firefox browser, introduced in 2004, has grabbed 23 per cent of the market. Microsofts share has dropped to 68 per cent.         
	But the latest battle was also prompted by a giant shift in computing that is increasingly making the web, not the PC, the place where people interact with complex software applications. Technology giants now see the browser as a control point to what users do online, and they want a say in shaping it.         
	In the last 18 months, Microsoft and Apple introduced greatly improved versions of their browsers, Internet Explorer and Safari. And Google entered the fray last autumn when it released its Chrome browser. Last month, Google said it would build an operating system with its principal function being to support its browser.         
	 Andreessens backing is certain to make RockMelt the focus of intense attention. For now, the company is keeping a lid on its plans.         
	On the companys website (www.rockmelt.com), the corporate name and the words coming soon are topped by a logo of the earth, with cracks exposing what seems to be molten lava from the planets core. A privacy policy on the site, which was removed after a reporter made inquiries to Vishria, indicates the browser is intended to be coupled somehow with Facebook.         
	Andreessen serves as a director of Facebook. The policy says that a person could use a Facebook ID to log into RockMelt, suggesting that the browser may be tailored to display Facebook updates and other features as users browse the web. Another browser, Flock, based on Firefox, already incorporates feeds from social networking sites.         
	But RockMelt is not currently working with Facebook. We are not aware of any details about RockMelt and its product, said Brandee Barker, a Facebook spokeswoman.         
	In the interview this summer, Andreessen credited Mozilla with coming up with an economic model to support web browsers.         
	The organisation has an agreement with Google that makes Google the standard home page when people start Firefox, and sends them to Google when they type something into the search box at the top of the browser. In 2007, Browsers today have a great business model, Andreessen said.

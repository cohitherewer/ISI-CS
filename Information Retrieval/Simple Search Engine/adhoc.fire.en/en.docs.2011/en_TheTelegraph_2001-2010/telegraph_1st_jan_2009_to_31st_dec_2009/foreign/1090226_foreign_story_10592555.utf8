	Amsterdam, Feb. 25 (Agencies): A Turkish Airlines plane with 134 people aboard slammed into a muddy field and broke into three pieces while attempting to land at Amsterdams main airport today but most passengers escaped alive.        
	Officials said nine people were killed and some 84 taken to hospital, including 25 who were severely hurt, when the flight from Istanbul crashed in light fog 3km short of a runway at Schiphol. Six passengers were said to be in critical condition.        
	The Boeing 737-800 broke into three pieces on impact. The fuselage split in two, close to the cockpit, and the tail broke off. One engine lay almost intact near the wreck in the muddy field. The other was some 180 metres from the plane and heavily damaged. There was no fire visible.        
	As far as I know there are no more passengers in the plane, Haarlemmermeer acting mayor Michel Bezuijen told reporters. We cannot say anything about the cause at the moment. The priority... is providing help and care.        
	Turkish transport minister Binali Yildirim said it was a miracle there were not more casualties.        
	The fact that the plane landed on a soft surface and that there was no fire helped keep the number of fatalities low, he said.        
	The bodies of three crew members in the cockpit were still in the planes wreckage, an investigator told reporters at Schiphol. It was not yet clear if the pilots were among them.        
	Local media said the pilot and co-pilot were among the dead.

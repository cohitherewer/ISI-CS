	Swear syllabus    
	 London, April 4: A school has been criticised after children as young as 11 were encouraged to shout obscenities during a lesson discussing swearing, reports The Daily Telegraph.      
	Swear words were written on a blackboard before their meaning was explained to 30 grade seven pupils in detail by a teacher.      
	Officials at St Laurence School in Bradford on Avon, Wiltshire, say the lesson was part of a sex and relationship education programme designed to dispel the myths of swear words. Parents, however, have said they were not informed about the content of the one-hour class and say their children were left deeply upset by the experience.    
	Nun dance    
	 Rome: An Italian lap dancer turned nun is to perform a religious dance in front of an audience of Roman Catholic cardinals and bishops, reports The Daily Telegraph. Anna Nobili, 38, spent years working as an exotic dancer and striptease artist in night clubs in Milan. But she swapped string bikinis and high heels for a nuns habit after a visit to the shrine of St Francis in Assisi in Umbria in 2002. Sister Nobili, as she became, joined an order of nuns called the Sister Workers of the Holy House of Nazareth. She claims to have been reborn by her faith in God and practises a form of mystical choreography which she calls Holy Dance. She is due to perform in front of senior Catholic clerics next week at the Holy Cross in Jerusalem Basilica, one of Romes best known churches.      
	Rush radar    
	 London: An 87-year-old woman had to be rescued by police in Cornwall after her mobility scooter sped out of control, reports The Daily Telegraph. Eileen Bishop and her husband, Anthony, from Perranporth, Cornwall, were on their way to their local church when she disappeared off the radar. Police later found her heading along the A3075 towards Newquay, five miles from the couples home. Bishop said the incident began when he and his wife set off for the nearby St Michaels church, after setting the scooter to three-quarters speed. Suddenly she passed me at full tilt, he said. I shouted after her, but she is a bit deaf. I couldnt chase her as I have had a triple heart bypass.    
	Gisele ties    
	 San Jose, Costa Rica (AP): Costa Ricas media are reporting that Gisele Bundchen and Tom Brady are in the Central American country to celebrate a second wedding. Television network Canal 7 is broadcasting footage of the Brazilian supermodel and the New England Patriots quarterback in the Pacific coast towns of Malpais and Santa Teresa on Thursday. The reports said on Friday that the couple were accompanied by relatives and friends. In recent years the area has become a popular destination for celebrities, including Mel Gibson.

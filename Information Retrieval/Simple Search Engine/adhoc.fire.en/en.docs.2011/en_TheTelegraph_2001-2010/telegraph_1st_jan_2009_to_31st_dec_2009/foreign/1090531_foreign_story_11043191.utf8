The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Rejected in love, Iraqi men plant bombs
                                                                                                               Rejected in love, Iraqi men plant bombs
          ROD NORDLAND                              
	Baghdad, May 30: This is how an Iraq courtship works: Boy meets girl. They exchange glances and text messages, the limit of respectable courting here. Then boy asks girls father for her hand. Dad turns him down. Boy goes to girls house and plants a bomb.        
	The authorities call it a love IED, or improvised explosive device.         
	Captain Nabil Abdul Hussein of the Iraqi national police said that six had exploded in the Dora neighbourhood of Baghdad alone in the past year.         
	These guys, they face any problem with their girlfriends, family, anyone, and theyre making this kind of IED, Captain Hussein said.        
	There have been no reported deaths or injuries from the devices used in this way, in Dora or elsewhere. Usually theyre putting them in front of the doors of their houses, not to kill, but to scare them, Captain Hussein said.        
	After six years of war, Iraq is a society with a serious anger management problem. That, along with a lot of men with a lot of experience fashioning bombs and setting ambushes, makes for a lethal mix.         
	The police say that many of the men are former insurgents who are no longer trying to kill foreign troops but who have an array of bomb-making skills and a stash of TNT.         
	Even without explosives, a popular type of explosive device can be made from common household items including petrol, a soda can and a plastic water bottle, with the innards of a mobile phone as a remote detonator.         
	Im a detective, and I dont even know how to make one of these, but all these kids do, the captain said.

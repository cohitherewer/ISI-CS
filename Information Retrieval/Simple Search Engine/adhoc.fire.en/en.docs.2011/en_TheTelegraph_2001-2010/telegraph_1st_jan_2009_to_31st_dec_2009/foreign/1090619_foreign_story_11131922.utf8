The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Jet lands with dead pilot
                                                                                                               Jet lands with dead pilot
                            
	Newark (New Jersey), June 18 (AP): The pilot of a Continental Airlines flight from Belgium to the US died over the Atlantic Ocean today, but the jet landed safely with two co-pilots at the controls.        
	Flight 61 touched down on-time just before noon at Newark Liberty International Airport, authorities said.         
	Passengers were not told of the pilots death in flight. During the flight, an announcement was made asking if any doctors were aboard and several passengers approached the cockpit. The 61-year-old Newark-based pilot, with more than 20 years of service to the airline, is believed to have died of natural causes.

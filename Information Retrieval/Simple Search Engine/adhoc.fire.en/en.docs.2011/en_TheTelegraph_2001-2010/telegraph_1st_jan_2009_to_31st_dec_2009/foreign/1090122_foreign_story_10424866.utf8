The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Bush twins offer advice 
                                                                                                               Bush twins offer advice 
                                Barbara and Jenna                           
	Washington, Jan. 21 (AP): Just in time for move-in day, the Bush twins offered their best advice yesterday to Sasha and Malia Obama on living in a magical place called the White House.        
	In an open letter to the Obama kids, 27-year-olds Barbara Bush and Jenna Hager advised the girls to relish it all  to go to anything and everything you possibly can.        
	Just go, they wrote in a letter published in the Wall Street Journal. Four years goes by so fast, so absorb it all, enjoy it all!        
	The twins reminisced about their favourite memories of the White House, and gave plenty of specific advice, too, to Sasha and Malia:        
	Surround yourselves with loyal friends.        
	Trick-or-treat down the plane aisle if youre travelling on Halloween.        
	Cherish your pets because sometimes youll need the quiet comfort that only animals can provide.        
	And this: Slide down the banister of the solarium, go to T-ball games, have swimming parties, and play Sardines on the White House lawn. Have fun and enjoy your childhood in such a magical place to live and play.        
	The twins turned serious at the end, recalling how the public image of their own father got distorted over the years. He is our father, not the sketch in the paper or part of a skit on TV, they wrote.

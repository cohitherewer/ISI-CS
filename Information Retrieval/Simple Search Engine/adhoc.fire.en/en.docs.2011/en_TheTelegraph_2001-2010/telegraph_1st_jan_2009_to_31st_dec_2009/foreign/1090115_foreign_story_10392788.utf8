The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Mumbai shadow on Obama big day
                                                                                                               Mumbai shadow on Obama big day
          K.P. NAYAR                                      
	Washington, Jan. 14: The November 26 terror attack on Mumbai is casting a long shadow over celebrations planned in Washington for the historic swearing-in of Americas first black president next Tuesday.        
	Yesterday, the outgoing President, George W Bush, declared a state of emergency in the national capital exactly one week before the swearing-in of the 44th President, Barack Obama.        
	The President-elect, Obama, verbalised fears of a Mumbai-style terrorist incident in the US when he said: You have to anticipate that having seen the mayhem that was created in Mumbai that there are going to be potential copycats or other terrorist organizations that think this is something they can replicate.        
	Because Obama said this on a mass viewership ABC talk show hosted by former Bill Clinton aide George Stephanopoulos, the incoming Presidents fears have become like one of the ten commandments for those in charge of Obamas swearing-in.        
	Security officials thrive in every country on doing the maximum, often bordering on the outrageous.         
	In Washington, US Secret Service and regional transportation officials have put together a plan to ban personal vehicles from all bridge crossings from Virginia into the national capital and from two arterial highways leading to the US Capitol where Obama will be sworn in.        
	The ham-handed idea will mean that the majority of one million plus people who want to see Obama on the day he is inaugurated as Americas 44th president will have no way to reach Washington from northern neighbourhoods outside the national capital.        
	Describing homeland security as his number one priority, Obama said: When you see what happened in Mumbai, that potentially points to a new strategy, not simply suicide bombings but you have (terrorist)commanders taking over their targets.        
	So we are going to have to be vigilant in terms of our intelligence, we are going to have to make sure that we are more effective in terms of anticipating some of these issues.        
	The plan to close access to Washington through several bridges and highwayson Obamas inauguration day has drawn intense criticism from people in Virginia, where a victory for Obama in the November election was a tipping point in his election as president.        
	The Secret Service, they are insane, James Moran, a member of the US House of Representatives from a part of Virginia that will be most affected by the closures told the local media.This is security on steroids. They are imposing major obstacles on people who have a right to be there for the inauguration.        
	Stung by such criticism, the White House belatedly recognised after declaring an emergency that it was probably too much for anyone to take.         
	White House spokesperson Dana Perino justified the emergency on the bizarre ground that such a declaration will make it possible for Bush to make emergency funds available to authorities in Washington for Obamas swearing-in.         
	The Presidents action makes federal funding available, she said, adding that emergency protective measures that are undertaken to save lives and protect public health and safety require federal government funding.         
	A sum of $15 million (Rs 73.7 crore) has already been set apart by the federal government for emergency planning and security, but latest calculations are that it may not be enough if there is a Mumbai-style terrorist attack.         
	Money for the swearing-in festivities are collected separately, this time in small donations from the public instead of contributions by lobbyists and big businesses at Obamas insistence.         
	Last week, at a hearing of the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee exclusively devoted to the Mumbai terrorist attacks, the FBIs chief intelligence officer, Donald Van Duyn said of the November 26 incidents: I think we can expect that groups will look to that as a model for themselves. We sometimes focus on tactics that may be exotic and esoteric... but for most terrorists, they are looking for what works.         
	During her confirmation hearing on Capitol Hill yesterday, secretary of state-designate Hillary Clinton also talked about the Mumbai incidents as representing a major challenge to US diplomacy.

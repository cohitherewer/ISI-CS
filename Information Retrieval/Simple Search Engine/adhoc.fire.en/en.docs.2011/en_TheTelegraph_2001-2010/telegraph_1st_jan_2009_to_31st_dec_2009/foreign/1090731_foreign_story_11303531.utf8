	Fatherly Law    
	 Los Angeles, July 30 (Reuters): Oscar-nominated actor Jude Law will become a father for the fourth time this autumn, his representative said yesterday. However, the mothers identity was not disclosed.      
	Jude Law can confirm that, following a relationship last year, he has been advised that he is to be the father of a child, his representative said.       
	Law is no longer in a relationship with the individual concerned, but he intends to be a fully supportive part of the childs life.

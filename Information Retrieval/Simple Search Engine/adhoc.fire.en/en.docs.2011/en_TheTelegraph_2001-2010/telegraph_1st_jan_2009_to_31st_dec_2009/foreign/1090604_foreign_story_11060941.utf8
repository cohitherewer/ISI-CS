	 London, June 3: Astronauts who have no history of bad headaches can be prone to disabling attacks while in space, neurologists say.       
	Contrary to prevailing theories, headaches in space are not caused by motion sickness, they said. Instead, the problem could lie in an increase in blood flow to the head, causing painful pressure on the brain, reports The Daily Telegraph.      
	A team led by Alla Vein at the Leiden University Medical Centre in the Netherlands asked one female and 16 male astronauts aged between 28 and 58 who had stayed aboard the International Space Station. Twelve of them reported 21 headaches.

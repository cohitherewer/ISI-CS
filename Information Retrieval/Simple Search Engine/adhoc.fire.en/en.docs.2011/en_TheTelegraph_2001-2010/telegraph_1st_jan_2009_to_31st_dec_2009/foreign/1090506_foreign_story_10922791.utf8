The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Attack alert triggers Swat exodus

	Mingora (Pakistan), May 5 (Reuters): Hundreds of people fled from the main town in Pakistans Swat Valley today after a government official urged residents in some neighbourhoods to seek safety as fresh fighting with Taliban militants could erupt.        
	A February peace pact aimed at ending Taliban violence in the Swat valley northwest of the capital has all but collapsed as the government comes under US pressure to get tough with the militants rather than appease them.        
	The top government official in Swat, Khushal Khan Khattak, said militants had infiltrated five districts of Mingora, the main town in Swat, and begun attacking security forces and government installations.        
	He said security forces could soon attack the militants and urged people to get out of harms way. But he later said the fear of fighting had passed and people could stay at home. The army said it was in control of the town.        
	That did not reassure fleeing residents as they crammed into and on top of buses to get out of Mingora, 130km from Islamabad.         
	Im taking my family to Peshawar because if theres any fighting, no one can protect us, said Mohammad Karim, as he searched for a bus heading out of the valley to Peshawar, the main city in the northwest. Some residents estimated thousands were fleeing.        
	Hundreds of thousands of people have fled from fighting in different parts of the northwest since last August, putting another burden on an economy being propped up by a $7.6 billion International Monetary Fund loan.        
	Mingora residents said earlier militants had surrounded a paramilitary force base at a power station in the town and others had taken up positions on buildings and were patrolling streets.        
	The military said in a statement security forces had beaten back an attack on the camp but a senior military official in the region said an operation might be launched to rescue 46 paramilitary soldiers besieged there.        
	Were acting with restraint because theyre using civilians as a shield but well go after them if the situation gets worse, said the military official, who declined to be identified.        
	The February peace pact, under which authorities agreed to a Taliban demand for introduction of Islamic sharia law in the former tourist valley, led to accusations from critics that the government was caving in to militancy.        
	The Taliban refused to give up their guns and pushed into Buner district, only 100km northwest of Islamabad, and another district adjacent to Swat last month.         
	US pressure        
	The US today ratcheted up pressure on Pakistan to take on Taliban militants.        
	Pakistan must demonstrate its commitment to rooting out al Qaida and the violent extremists within its borders, Richard Holbrooke, the US special representative for Afghanistan and Pakistan, said in prepared congressional testimony.        
	A Pakistani court set free today two men sentenced to death for planning the killing of 11 French navy engineers in a 2002 bomb attack in the city of Karachi, a defence lawyer said.

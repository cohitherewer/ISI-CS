The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Musharraf actions illegal, says court 
                                                                                                               Musharraf actions illegal, says court 
          NASIR JAFFRY                                             
	Islamabad, July 31: In a landmark judgement, Pakistans Supreme Court today declared the November 3,2007 actions of former military dictator Pervez Musharraf including imposition of emergency measures as quot;illegal and unconstitutional quot;.        
	A 14-judge bench headed by Chief Justice Iftikhar Muhammed Chaudhry announced the verdict after hearing for over a week petitions challenging imposition of emergency, sacking of judges, who refused to take fresh oath of allegiance to Musharraf under Provisional Constitutional order.         
	The verdict, which was announced with a delay of over five hours, said that sacking of judges was illegal and unconstitutional.         
	The court was to deliver the verdict at 3 p.m but it came well after 8 p.m. The court officials did not give any reasons as to what caused the delay.        
	The courtroom was packed with lawyers, constitutional experts and media personalities, who remained seated in the dazzling court room for five hours to hear what majority of jurists called a historic verdict, which would block the way and close the doors for any future intervention by quot;undemocratic quot; forces.         
	The court also declared all actions by former chief justice Abdul Hameed Doggar and other judges, who were appointed under PCO quot;unconstitutional and illegal. quot;         
	Analysts believe that more than a dozen judges in the higher courts, who had taken oath under PCO would have to go home under the courts verdict.         
	Musharraf, who seized power in October 1999 after ousting Prime Minister Nawaz Sharifs government, ruled the country for nine years but stepped down August last year over fears of impeachement by the then ruling coalition of Pakistan Peoples Party and Pakistan Muslim League (Nawaz), which formed their government in the centre and in the provinces after winning February 12008 elections.         
	Musharraf, who was summoned by the apex court to explain the circumstances that forces him to impose emergency rule and depose over 60 judges of the higher judiciary in 2007, ignored the notice and did not appear on Wednesday.         
	Lawyers believed that Musharraf could not be handed down any punishment even if he decided not to appear before the court but it would be a quot;moral defeat quot; for him and what his opponents call his unconstitutional rule.         
	 quot;The court, which wishes to undo wrongs of the past, just wanted him to explain his position. However, if he decides not to appear before the court, he would not be handed down any punishment, quot; Musharrafs former deputy attorney general, Raja Abdur Rehman told The Telegreaph.         
	Musharraf, who became president for the second term in October 2007 while holding office of the army chief, imposed emergency rule and deposed 60 judges including Iftikhar Mohammad Chaudhry after he realized that the Supreme Court might overturn his victory as he was not eligible to contest the election in uniform.         
	The former presidents spokesperson Saif Ali Khan told Dawn TV from London that quot;we accept this verdict, which was expected . quot;         
	 quot;He is definitely in fighting spirit as he was expecting this decision, quot; Khan said.         
	He said Musharraf would definitely return to Pakistan and face his opponents.         
	But a leading Pakistani lawyer Aitzaz Ahsan, who defended justice Chaudhry in a presidential reference that was filed against him for misuse of powers in March 2007, believe that Musharraf would not return to the country.         
	He told reporters that Musharraf should be tried for violating constitution many times, adding that the Supreme Courts verdict would block the way and close doors for any future intervention by quot;undemocratic forces quot;.

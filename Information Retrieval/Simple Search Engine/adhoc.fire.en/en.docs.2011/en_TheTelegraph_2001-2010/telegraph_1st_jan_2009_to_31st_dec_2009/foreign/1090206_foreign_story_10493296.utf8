                                                                                                               Civilians flee Lanka war zone
                            
	Colombo, Feb. 5 (Reuters): At least 800 civilians caught in fighting escaped Sri Lankas war zone today, the military said, and the government renewed a call for Tamil Tiger rebels to surrender unconditionally or face destruction.        
	Battles flared around a shrinking wedge of jungle in the Indian Ocean islands northeast, that the military now measures at about 200sqkm and in which the LTTE are trapped.        
	Tens of thousands of civilians are also being held there by the Tigers, under grave threat of harm from the fighting and a lack of food and medicines, aid agencies say.        
	At least 800 civilians have come out today, military spokesman Brigadier Udaya Nanayakkara said. Troops also seized a base on the eastern front at Vishvamadu, and the final redoubt of the separatist guerrillas naval wing at Chalai on the northeast coast, Nanayakkara said.        
	Troops killed 15 rebels including three senior guerrillas, against the loss of three soldiers in the battle, he said. The LTTE had no immediate comment. The pro-rebel website www.TamilNet.com said seven people were killed in shelling at a hospital.

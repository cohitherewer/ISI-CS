The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | China town sealed after plague kills two
                                                                                                               China town sealed after plague kills two
                            
	Beijing, Aug. 3 (AP): A second man has died of pneumonic plague in northwest China, in an outbreak that prompted authorities to lock down a town where about a dozen people were infected with the highly contagious and deadly lung disease, a state news agency said.        
	The WHO office in China said it was in close contact with Chinese health authorities and that measures taken so far to treat and quarantine sickened people were appropriate. The man who died yesterday was identified only as 37-year-old Danzin from Ziketan, the stricken town in Qinghai province, the official Xinhua News Agency said.        
	Danzin was a neighbour of the first person who died, a 32-year-old herdsman whose name was not given. Another 10 people, mostly relatives of the first deceased man, were infected and undergoing isolated treatment in hospital, Xinhua said in a report late yesterday.         
	The town of 10,000 people has been sealed off and a team of experts was sent to the area, the local health bureau said yesterday, warning that anyone with a cough or fever who visited the town since mid-July should seek treatment at a hospital.         
	A food seller surnamed Han at the Crystal Alley Market in Ziketan said authorities have said homes and shops should be disinfected and residents should wear masks when they go out. He said 80 per cent of shops in the town were closed and prices of disinfectants and some vegetables have tripled.        
	People are so scared. There are few people on the streets, Han said by telephone. There are police guarding the quarantine centre at the township hospital but not on the streets.

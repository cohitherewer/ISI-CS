The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Hillary gets warm welcome
                                                                                                               Hillary gets warm welcome
                              Clinton                            
	Washington, Jan. 22 (Reuters): Former New York Senator Hillary Clinton officially took the helm at the state department today, promising a new era in US diplomacy but tough times ahead.        
	About 1,000 employees crammed the entrance to the department and cheered robustly when Clinton arrived for her first full day as secretary of state. I will do all that I can working with you to make it abundantly clear that robust diplomacy and effective development are the best long-term tools for securing Americas future, Clinton said.        
	I believe with all my heart that this is a new era for America, she said. Waiting for Clinton in her office was a letter of welcome and advice from Condoleezza Rice, who held the job under President George W. Bush.

	Jolie vs Jen    
	 Los Angeles, Nov. 15 (PTI): Angelina Jolie had spearheaded a smear campaign against her partner Brad Pitts former wife Jennifer Aniston, a new book has revealed.      
	Brangelina, by Ian Harperlin, claims Jolie, with whom Pitt made his relation public soon after splitting with Aniston, did not want to be called a man-stealer.       
	Jolie... planted press stories in 2005 that painted Aniston in a negative light. Specifically? That Aniston firmly prioritised her career over starting a family which put her directly at odds with Pitt, who ached for kids, Harperlin writes.     
	Model line    
	 London (PTI): Supermodel Claudia Schiffer wants to create her own range of clothes. I have been approached so many times over the last 20 years but it has never been the right time. Now, I would consider it. They would need to be clothes that I would want to wear, Schiffer said.

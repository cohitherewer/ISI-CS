The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Polls flawed, admits Iran regime
                                                                                                               Polls flawed, admits Iran regime
          NAZILA FATHI AND MICHAEL SLACKMAN                              
	Tehran, June 22: Irans most senior panel of election monitors, in the most sweeping acknowledgment that the presidential election was flawed, said today that the number of votes cast in 50 cities exceeded the actual number of voters, according to a state television report.        
	The discrepancies could affect some three million ballots of what the government says was 40 million cast, giving the official victory to the incumbent President, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad.        
	But the authorities insisted that the discrepancies did not violate Iranian law and the countrys influential Guardian Council said it was not clear whether they would decisively change the election result.        
	The news emerged on the English-language Press TV website late yesterday as a bitter rift among Irans ruling clerics deepened over the disputed election.         
	The outcome of the vote, awarding a lopsided victory to President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, has convulsed Tehran in the worst violence in 30 years, with the government trying to link the defiant loser to terrorists and detaining relatives of his powerful backer, a founder of the Islamic republic.        
	Today, after a warning from the powerful Revolutionary Guard not to return to the streets, several hundred protesters defiantly gathered in central Tehran today and were quickly dispersed by an overwhelming show of police force.         
	The protesters, far fewer than the numbers who attended mass rallies last week, turned out despite the warning, on the Guards website, that they would face a revolutionary confrontation if they continued to challenge the results of the June 12 election and their countrys supreme leader, who has pronounced the ballot to be fair.         
	The loser, Mir Hussein Moussavi, the moderate reform candidate who contends that the June 12 election was stolen from him, fired back at his accusers last night in a posting on his website, calling on his own supporters to demonstrate peacefully despite stern warnings from Irans supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, that no protests of the vote would be allowed. Protesting to lies and fraud is your right, Moussavi said in a challenge to Khameneis authority.        
	The official result gave Ahmadinejad 63 per cent of the ballot  an 11-million vote advantage  to Moussavis 34 per cent.        
	At a news conference today, Hassan Qashqavi, a foreign ministry spokesman, called the turnout  officially put at 85 per cent, or 40 million voters  a brilliant gem. He accused unidentified western powers and news organisations of spreading unacceptable anarchy and vandalism.

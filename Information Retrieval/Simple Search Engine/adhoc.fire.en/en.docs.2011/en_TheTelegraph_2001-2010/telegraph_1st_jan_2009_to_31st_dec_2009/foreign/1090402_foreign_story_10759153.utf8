	Colombo, April 1 (Reuters): The son and heir apparent to Tamil Tiger leader Velupillai Prabhakaran has been wounded in a gunbattle with soldiers trying to crush the LTTE, the military said today.        
	The battle to end the quarter-century war is centred around 25sqkm of the Indian Ocean islands northeastern coast, where the army has encircled the Tigers and tens of thousands of civilians trapped there.        
	Intelligence sources confirmed that LTTE leader Prabhakarans elder son, Charles Anthony, was injured in fighting, military spokesperson Brigadier Udaya Nanayakkara said. He had no details of the extent of the injuries or his condition. There was no independent confirmation available and the Tigers could not be reached for comment.        
	Nanayakkara also said troops killed at least 19 guerrillas yesterday.

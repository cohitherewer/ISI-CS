The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Militants now target women: Pakistanis
                                                                                                               Militants now target women: Pakistanis

	Islamabad, Oct. 31: Sarah Hassan, 22, changed her Facebook status to Why is this happening to us?? hours after the massive car bombing that ripped through a crowded market frequented by female shoppers in the northwestern city of Peshawar on Wednesday.        
	Hassan is one of many Pakistanis asking that question, and the latest spasm of violence in Pakistan cities has prompted new concerns that militants have begun to specifically target women in their terror campaign.        
	Hassan, who works at an immigration consulting firm in the eastern city of Lahore, said she is hearing more and more stories of loss. A friend lost her sister and father in a terrorist attack in Peshawar on October 16, she said. I could not even call her. I could not get myself to console with her. I am depressed and think about all these innocent people who are losing their lives almost every day, she said.         
	Another girl she knew became disabled after suffering injuries in the suicide attack that targeted a university in Islamabad.        
	But Hassan did not think that the attacks of late were specifically targeting women. They are just randomly killing innocent people, she said, referring to the militants. The threat of terrorism now loomed large in the cities, having crept from the northwestern edges of the country.        
	Secretary of state Hillary Rodham Clintons visit served to feed fears in Lahore on Thursday, Hassan said. The whole day we feared hearing about a terrorist attack here. This is no life. Our lives are getting affected and why, she asked. This cannot go on. It has to stop. We want to progress. We want to have careers, but it all seems impossible now, she said referring to herself and her friends.         
	Earlier, we used to discuss boys or movies and now we cant socialise or go out. We cannot go out for shopping. Parents tell us to stay inside our homes. What if terrorists start attacking residential areas now? she wondered.

	Washington, Nov. 21: A former state department official, who traces his roots to telephone inventor Alexander Graham Bell, and his wife admitted in federal court yesterday that they spied for Cuba over the past three decades.        
	Walter K. Myers, 72, and his wife, Gwendolyn Steingraber Myers, 71, admitted they received coded instructions over a shortwave radio and passed along information to intelligence operatives in dead drops and hand-to-hand passes.        
	Myers pleaded guilty to conspiring to commit espionage and wire fraud. Gwendolyn Myers pleaded guilty to conspiring to gather and transmit national defence information.        
	Under the plea deal, Walter Myers faces a mandatory sentence of life in prison, and his wife, six to seven-and-a-half years. Both agreed to give extensive debriefings to US law enforcement officials before they are sentenced. No sentencing date was set.        
	The couples attorney, Bradford Berenson, said in a statement after the hearing that the Myerses were not motivated by greed but spied out of conscience and personal commitment. Walter Myerss mother Elsie was Bells granddaughter.

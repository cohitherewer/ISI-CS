          NASIR JAFFRY                              
	Islamabad, April 3: The Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) has offered the ruling Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) a share in the Punjab government.        
	Punjab chief minister Shahbaz Sharif, who was re-instated by the Supreme Court earlier this week after suspending a disqualification order it had issued earlier, made the offer to Prime Minister Yousuf Raza Gilani during a meeting with the hope that the two parties unite to form coalition governments at the centre and in the Punjab province.         
	However, top PML-N official,s including party secretary Siddique-ul-Farooque, said the league would not join the coalition at the centre and would remain in the Opposition in the federal legislature instead. We will not join the coalition government at the centre, Farooque told The Telegraph. He said the PML-N would try its its level best to strengthen democracy.

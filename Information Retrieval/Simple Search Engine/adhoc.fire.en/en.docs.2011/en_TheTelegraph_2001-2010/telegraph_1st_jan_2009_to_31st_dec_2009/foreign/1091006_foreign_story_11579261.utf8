The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Blast rocks Pak UN office
                                                                                                               Blast rocks Pak UN office
          NASIR JAFFRY AND AGENCIES                                    
	Islamabad, Oct. 5 (Reuters): A suicide bomber dressed as a paramilitary soldier attacked an office of the UN World Food Programme (WFP) in the Pakistani capital today, killing five staff members, government and UN officials said.        
	I went to my office on the first floor and as I sat on my chair there was a huge blast, WFP official Arshad Jadoon told Reuters outside the tightly guarded office in a residential area of Islamabad. All of a sudden, a smoke cloud enveloped the building and we came out where wounded people were lying, he said.        
	A WFP spokesman, Amjad Jamal, said five staff members had been killed, four Pakistanis and an Iraqi. At least two of the Pakistanis were women.        
	UN secretary-general Ban Ki-moon said the attack was a heinous crime. This is a terrible tragedy for the UN and for the whole humanitarian community in Pakistan, he said in a statement condemning the bombing in the strongest terms and issued in Geneva where he is on a two-day visit.        
	The UN temporarily closed its office in Pakistan after the blast for security reasons, spokesperson Susan Manuel told The Telegraph. She described the incident as reprehensible saying that terrorists targeted WFP, which is feeding up to two million people displaced by recent military operations.         
	She was also surprised how the attacker managed to entered the building, saying that the building was well protected.        
	Two foreign UN workers were killed in a suicide car bomb attack on a hotel in the northwestern city of Peshawar in June. The army has made progress against militants in the northwest and interior minister Rehman Malik says the back of the Pakistani Taliban has been broken.        
	But the militants have struck back with several bomb attacks in recent days as the army prepares to launch an offensive on the Pakistani Talibans main bastion in the South Waziristan region on the Afghan border.        
	The bomber was disguised as a paramilitary soldier and got into the WFP compound after asking a guard at the gate if he could use a toilet, Malik told reporters at the scene. They are like a wounded snake, Malik said.

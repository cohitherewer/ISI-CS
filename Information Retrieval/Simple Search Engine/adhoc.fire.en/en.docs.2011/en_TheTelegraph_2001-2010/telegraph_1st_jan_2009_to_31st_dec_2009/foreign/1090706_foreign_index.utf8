                                                                                                                                          The most important group of religious leaders in Iran called the disputed presidential election and the new government illegitimate yesterday, an act of defiance against the countrys supreme leader and the most public sign of a major split in the countrys clerical establishment.                 A Nepalese minister who chose to speak in Hindi at a programme here faced opposition from the audience.

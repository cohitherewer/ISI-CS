The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Women eat daintily near men
                                                                                                               Women eat daintily near men
                            
	Washington, Aug. 10: Young women tend to choose low-calorie meals when dining with males than when eating with other women, a new study shows.        
	Reporting online in the journal Appetite, researchers from McMaster University in Ontario, Canada, observed students in university cafeterias. When women ate with men, they skimped on their food; the more the men, the more the skimping. But when they ate with the girls, they consumed more calories.        
	The studys lead author suggested that women have been conditioned by the diet industry to perceive smaller portions of food as more feminine and that women feel that eating less will make them more attractive to men.

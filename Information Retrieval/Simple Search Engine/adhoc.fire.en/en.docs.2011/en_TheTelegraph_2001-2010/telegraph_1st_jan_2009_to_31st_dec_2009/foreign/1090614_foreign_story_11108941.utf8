The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Pakistan hikes defence spending
                                                                                                               Pakistan hikes defence spending
          NASIR JAFFRY                              
	Islamabad, June 13: Pakistans government today hiked its annual defence spending as it unveiled the 2.4 trillion rupee national budget for the year 2009-10.        
	The hefty allocation of rupees 343 billion rupees for defence as against the meager spending of 6.5 billion for health and 31.5 billion for education has been made in the budget against the backdrop of ongoing major ground and air offensive by Pakistani armed forces against Taliban in the countrys northwest.        
	Our armed forces are in the forefront of the war against terror and our western border is most volatile, facing the brunt of insurgency, state minister for finance Hina Rabbani Khar said while presenting the budget in the National Assembly.        
	The allocation for the next year, starting July 1 was up by 47 billion rupees as against the amount of 296 billion rupees earmarked under the same head for the outgoing year of 2008-09.        
	She said that efforts of the government to manage the economic and financial affairs of the country needed to be viewed in the context of the prevailing state of security in the country.        
	We are today fighting insurgency and terrorism within the country, she said, adding the war on terror has already cost Pakistan over $35 billion since 2001-02.        
	The budget came a day after President Asif Ali Zardari announced a lucrative increase in the salaries of armed forces personnel fighting militancy on western borders, from July 1. The remaining personnel would get the increase from January 1.        
	I hope this small gesture on part of the government would help build morale of our soldiers involved in the war against terror, Khar said, as all economic indicators showed a dismal picture with inflation sticking to 14 percent and overall fiscal deficit mounting to 7.6 per cent of the GDP during the out-going year.        
	She also announced allocation of rupees 50 billion for rehabilitation of more than two million people displaced by the military operation in northwestern districts of Lower Dir, Buner and Swat.

	Washington, July 12: An emergency aboard Barack Obamas campaign plane last July nearly had catastrophic effects after an evacuation slide inflated in mid flight, it has emerged.         
	Shortly after leaving Chicago, an evacuation slide mysteriously inflated in the planes tail section, preventing the flaps that controlled the aircrafts pitch from functioning properly. As he struggled with the controls, the pilot ordered an emergency landing.         
	The 27-year-old MD-80 aircraft diverted to St Louis and as it descended the pilot regained control of the flaps allowing the plane to land normally.         
	Unaware how close to disaster he had been, Obama drily remarked: Just thought wed spice things up a bit today.

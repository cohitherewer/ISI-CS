The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Israel strike hits UN building
                                                                                                               Israel strike hits UN building
                            
	Gaza, Jan. 15: Israeli forces shelled areas deep inside Gaza City, including a UN building, and edged toward the city centre today, sending thousands of panicked residents fleeing from their homes, witnesses and UN officials said.         
	Among the buildings hit in the centre of Gaza City, the witnesses said, was one housing the headquarters of the UN Relief and Works Agency that assists Palestinian refugees and another occupied by several media organisations.         
	The UN secretary general, Ban Ki-Moon, visiting Jerusalem, said he expressed strong protest and outrage to Israel. Ban said defence minister Ehud Barak had told him the shelling was a grave mistake.

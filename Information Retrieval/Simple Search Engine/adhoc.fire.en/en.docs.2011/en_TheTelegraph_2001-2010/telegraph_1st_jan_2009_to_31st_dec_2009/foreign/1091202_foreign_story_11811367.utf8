The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Obama orders fast troop surge

	Washington, Dec. 1: President Obama has decided to expedite the deployment of 30,000 additional American troops to Afghanistan over the next six months, in an effort to reverse the momentum of Taliban gains.        
	It is also meant to create an urgency for the Kabul government to match the American surge with one using its own forces, according to senior administration officials.        
	In bringing the total American force to nearly 100,000 troops by the end of May, the administration will move far faster than it had originally planned. Until recently, discussions focused on a deployment that would take a year. However, Obama concluded that the situation required more, sooner, as one official said, explaining some of the central conclusions Obama reached at the end of a nearly three-month review of American war strategy.        
	The officials insisted on anonymity to discuss the strategy for Afghanistan and Pakistan that Obama will formally announce tonight (5am IST Wednesday) in a nationally televised address from the US Military Academy at West Point.        
	The strategy aims to prevent al Qaida from returning to Afghanistan, whose territory it used to prepare the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, and to keep Taliban insurgents from toppling the government there.         
	The 30,000 new American troops will focus on securing a number of population centres in Afghanistan where the Taliban are strongest, including Kandahar in the south and Khost in the east, the officials said. The American forces, they said, will pair up with specific Afghan units in an effort to end eight years of frustrating attempts to build them into an independent fighting force.        
	Obama has concluded that the strategy for dealing with the Taliban should be to degrade its ability, in the words of one of the officials deeply involved in the discussions, so that the Afghan forces are capable of taking them on. At the same time, the Presidents strategy calls for carving away at the bottom of the Talibans force structure by reintegrating less committed members into tribes.        
	We want to knock the Taliban back, giving us time and space to build the Afghans up mainly in the security front but also in governance and development as well, said one senior administration official. By weakening the Taliban through a quick infusion of troops, the official said, the administration hopes to make it a more manageable enemy for the Afghans to take on themselves.        
	For Obama, the strategy is a gamble in a war that has already gone on for 8 years.                             NEW YORK TIMES NEWS SERVICE

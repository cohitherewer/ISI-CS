	Islamabad/Lahore, Dec. 3 (PTI): Lahore High Court today disposed of 2 petitions from Lashkar-e-Toiba operative and alleged 26/11 planner Zakiur Rehman Lakhvi.        
	The petitions challenged Lakhvis indictment for his involvement in the 26/11 attacks.        
	Lakhvis lawyer Khwaja Sultan Ahmed claimed during proceedings that the prosecution had no incriminating evidence against his client. He said the statement given to Indian authorities by Ajmal Amir Kasab was not admissible in court. However, the judges told Ahmed such issues could be addressed only when the evidence was presented during the trial in the court.

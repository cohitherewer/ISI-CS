	Paris name    
	 Los Angeles, July 24 (PTI): Socialite Paris Hilton has claimed that Michael Jackson named his daughter after her.       
	The 28-year old hotel heiress claimed that her mother Kathy and Jackson were childhood friends and the star had asked her mother if he could name his daughter Paris.       
	My mom and Michael went to high school together and they were best friends since they were 13. So I grew up knowing Michael very well and when he had his daughter, he always loved the name Paris and grew up being an uncle to me, Hilton said during a TV show.       
	Paris added that she is glad the legends daughter shares her name.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Pak raids firm tied to US

	Islamabad, Sept. 19 (AP): Pakistani police raided a local security firm that helps protect the US embassy today, seizing dozens of allegedly unlicensed weapons.        
	Two employees of the Inter-Risk company were arrested during the raids in Islamabad, police official Rana Akram told a news conference. Reporters were shown the seized weapons  61 assault rifles and nine pistols. Akram said police were seeking the firms owner.        
	US embassy spokesman Rick Snelsire said the US contract with Inter-Risk took effect at the start of 2009. It is believed to be the first pact the firm has signed with the US, said Snelsire, who did not have a figure for its amount.        
	Our understanding is they obtained licenses with whatever they brought into the country to meet the contractual needs, he said. We told the government that we had a contract with Inter-Risk, that Inter-Risk would be providing security at the embassy and our consulates.        
	Akram said he had no idea about any US links to Inter-Risk, but the company was recently mentioned in local media reports that have been trying to establish the types of private security firms American diplomats use in Pakistan.        
	In particular, Pakistani reporters, anti-US bloggers and others have suggested the US is using the American firm formerly known as Blackwater  a claim that chills many Pakistanis because of the companys alleged involvement in killings of Iraqi civilians. The US embassy denies it uses Blackwater  now known as Xe Services  in Pakistan.        
	Scandals involving US private contractors have occurred elsewhere in the region.        
	In Washington yesterday, the Commission on Wartime Contracting heard testimony about another contractor  ArmorGroup North America  involving alleged illegal and immoral conduct by its guards at the US embassy in Afghanistan.        
	The Iraqi government refused to grant Xe Services an operating license earlier this year amid continued outrage over a 2007 lethal firefight involving some of its employees in Baghdad.

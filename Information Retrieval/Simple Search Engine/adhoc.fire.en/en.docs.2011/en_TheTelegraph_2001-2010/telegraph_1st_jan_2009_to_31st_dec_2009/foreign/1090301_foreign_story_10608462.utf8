                                                                                                               Woman swaps kids for bird
                            
	Washington, Feb. 28 (AFP): Police in the southern US state of Louisiana have arrested a woman who allegedly traded two young children for an exotic bird and a bit of cash, a detective on the case said.        
	Donna Greenwell, a 51-year-old long distance trucker, has been charged with aggravated kidnapping and is jailed on a bond of $100,000 after she swapped a four- and five-year-old in her care for a cockatoo and $175, the detective said.

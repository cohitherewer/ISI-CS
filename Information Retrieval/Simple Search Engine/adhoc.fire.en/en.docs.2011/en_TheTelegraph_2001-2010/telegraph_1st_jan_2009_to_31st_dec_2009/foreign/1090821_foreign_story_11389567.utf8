	Kabul, Aug. 20: Defying Taliban warnings and a flurry of rocket attacks apparently aimed at polling stations, Afghans voted today in an election that has become a benchmark for the nations progress for both the Afghan government and the Obama administration.        
	The polls closed at 5pm in Afghanistan, and the vote-counting began immediately.         
	Initial reports from witnesses suggested that the turnout was uneven across the country, with higher participation in the relatively peaceful north than in the troubled south.         
	There, insurgents threw up makeshift roadblocks in one area to warn off voters, and in Kandahar, witnesses said, insurgents hanged two people because their fingers were marked with indelible ink used to denote that they had voted.        
	I know the Taliban threaten people not to vote, but I am coming and using my vote, said Bakht Muhammad, 24, after he voted in Kandahar. I want change. I want security. I want to live my life in our country.        
	Officials from the Obama administration, on hand to monitor the elections, expressed reserved optimism that the voting was transparent. But they fretted about whether the ballot counting would be equally so.        
	Richard C. Holbrooke, the special representative to Afghanistan and Pakistan, visited four polling stations in Kabul today, chatting with poll workers and voters. At each of the polling stations he visited  three in a school and one in a mosque  workers reported a steady stream of voters.        
	The vote is clearly transparent, Holbrooke told reporters, as a group of Afghan women flowed into the polling station behind him. But the test is going to be in the counting. If the will of the electorate is going to be thwarted, it will happen in the counting.        
	Polls opened at 7am. As early as 8am in Kabul, officials at the American Embassy were getting complaints of fraud. Ashraf Ghani, the former finance minister who is one of the presidential candidates, emailed American officials to say that he had reports that his opponents were stuffing ballot boxes. Other presidential candidates were making similar complaints to American officials.        
	As the suspicions of election fraud continued throughout the day, there were reports of sporadic violence that began in the morning as polls opened.        
	In Kabul, the Afghan police fought a gun battle today with three men who took over a house overlooking police headquarters in the Kart-e-Now district of the capital, killing two of them and capturing one, a police official said at the scene as bystanders applauded the officers who had fought the insurgents.

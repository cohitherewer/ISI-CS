	London, Sept. 14 (PTI): Actress Jennifer Connelly rarely sets a foot wrong when it comes to style, but her choice of dress left something to be desired at the premiere of her latest film at the Toronto International Film Festival.         
	The deep red figure-hugging creation by Italian label Bottega Veneta did little to accentuate the actresss slim frame, reports the Daily Mail.         
	Instead of clinging to every curve, the top half of the dress appeared to be too tight, flattening her chest rather than enhancing it. While the bottom half, in contrast, was too loose, the report said. Connelly was promoting Creation, a film based on the life of Charles Darwin, who is played by her real-life husband, Paul Bettany, at the festival.

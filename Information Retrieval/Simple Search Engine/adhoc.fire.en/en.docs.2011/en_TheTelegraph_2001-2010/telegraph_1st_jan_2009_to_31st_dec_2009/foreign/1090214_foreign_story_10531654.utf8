	New York, Feb. 13: A Continental flight from Newark to Buffalo crashed into a house about five miles from Buffalo Niagara International Airport last night, killing 50 people, officials said.        
	The plane carried 44 passengers, a crew of 4 and an off-duty crew member, according to the Federal Aviation Administration. All the people aboard the plane and one person in the house were killed in the crash, which occurred in the hamlet of Clarence Center, New York, said Chris Collins, the Erie County executive.         
	Two other persons in the house, a woman and child, suffered minor injuries and were taken to a hospital, Collins said.         
	Mike Hughes, a spokesman for Millard Fillmore Suburban Hospital, said in a telephone interview on MSNBC that the two had been treated and released. The plane, Continental Connection Flight 3407, crashed at about 10.20 (local time), five minutes before it was due to land. The plane  a Bombardier Dash 8 Q400 with 74 seats and twin turboprop engines  was on approach to land. It was operated by Colgan Airways, a feeder airline for Continental.        
	David Bissonette, the emergency coordinator for Erie County, speaking at a news conference at about 4am, said the plane made a direct hit on the house, which officials said was located at 6038 Long Street in Clarence Center. Its remarkable that it only took one house, he said. It could have easily taken the whole neighbourhood.                  
	He said the only recognisable piece of the plane was the tail. The investigation, he said, would be painstaking because of the amount of damage to the plane and the house. Collins said that about 12 houses had been evacuated after the crash and that a limited state of emergency had been declared.        
	The crash, which occurred as a light snow fell in the area, was the second major one in a month in New York state, coming weeks after the January 15 forced landing of a US Airways jet into the Hudson river in which all 155 people on board were pulled to safety        
	Sandra Baker, who lives on Railroad Street, two blocks from the site of the crash yesterday, said: It was just like a huge great big crash, a boom. Both her sons, volunteer firefighters, went to the scene.         
	There was this banging sound before the crash, she said. It was followed by a boom, then a dark cloud and flames and the smell of fuel and fire.         
	9/11 widow on jet        
	Beverly Eckert, whose husband was killed in the September 11,2001, attacks, was a passenger on the plane, her sister told a local newspaper.        
	Eckerts husband, Sean Rooney, was in one of the World Trade Center towers in New York city that were destroyed by al Qaida militants.         
	The Buffalo News quoted Eckerts sister Sue Bourque as saying she was on the commuter plane that crashed last evening.

          DANIEL DE VISE                                    
	Washington, Sept. 19: The arrival of Twitter on Capitol Hill has given ordinary citizens access to the candid, real-time thoughts of their elected representatives.        
	Like this dispatch from Representative Neil Abercrombie: just completed weightlifting workout at the Nuuanu Y. Or this, from Senator Charles E. Grassley: I will b intrvud on AgriTalk at 10amCST. Pls tune in.        
	A team of researchers from the University of Maryland plodded through more than 6,000 Twitter postings by members of Congress to study whether the social networking site promoted transparency in politics and dialogue between elected leaders and the public. They found  surprise!  that politicians spend most of their time on Twitter promoting themselves.         
	Launched in 2006, Twitter allows users to send succinct (no more than 140 characters) reports on their comings, goings and musings. Sixty-nine members of Congress had Twitter accounts by February. The number has since risen to 169.         
	Eighty per cent of the congressional Twitter postings reviewed by the researchers fell into two categories: links to news articles and press releases, mostly self-serving and readily available elsewhere; and status updates that chronicle the politicians latest trip to the sawmill or the supermarket. The researchers announced their findings this week and hope to present them at an international conference on human-computer interaction in the spring.        
	Twitter by its nature is a very self-absorbed service, said Jennifer Golbeck, lead researcher and assistant professor in the universitys College of Information Studies. Politicians are very self-important people. Many Twitter postings read like very short press releases. We learn from Representative Tom Latham, for example, that he is working to help Iowans as they contend with all the flooding throughout the state. Senator Barbara Boxer advises: On Rachel Maddow right after this commercial break. Tune in!        
	While few politicians have bared their souls on Twitter, some have nonetheless managed to tweet themselves into trouble. Representative Peter Hoekstra caught flak in February when he posted, Just landed in Baghdad, inadvertently posing a security risk for his congressional delegation. He drew criticism again in June for likening the tumult in Iran to Republican conflicts with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi.                    LOS ANGELES TIMES-WASHINGTON POST NEWS SERVICE

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Tiger boss will fight to death 
                                                                                                               Tiger boss will fight to death 
          MIAN RIDGE AND NICK MEO                          Prabhakaran: Ruthless                                  
	Colombo, April 26: Velupillai Prabhakaran will fight to the death instead of surrendering, the Tamil Tiger chiefs former right-hand man Colonel Karuna has told The Sunday Telegraph.         
	Prabhakaran, whose ruthless will has driven the Tigers for nearly three decades, was believed to be still in command of his surviving fighters last night, cornered in a shrinking patch of territory in Sri Lanka.         
	The Lankan government has urged him to surrender and end fighting in which thousands have died. But most generals and officials privately say only the death of the Tigers leader will end the islands long war.         
	Sri Lanka lost so many fighters and civilians and Prabhakaran is responsible for all this, Karuna said. I used to say to him, Why did you kill all those people? Hes a very horrible man. He has to be eliminated.         
	Karuna  whose real name is Vinayagamoorthi Muralitharan  was a child soldier who rose to become Prabhakarans number two before defecting to the government.         
	He tore the movement apart when he left, taking with him around a third of the Tigers fighters, in 2006. He also provided vital intelligence which has helped the army to bring the LTTE to its knees.         
	He gave an interview at his heavily-fortified headquarters in Colombo.         
	Karuna split from the Tigers because he feared assassination at the hands of their leader, who for years had any potential rival killed. Since he left he has been just as much of a target. I am number one on the LTTEs hit list, he said.         
	 One official in Colombo said: The Shining Path in Peru and the Khmer Rouge in Cambodia both fizzled out when their top leadership was dead or captured. It will be the same with the LTTE.         
	Prabhakaran, a dumpy 54-year-old with a moustache, has been described as lacking in charisma. Outsiders who have met him have described the experience as like meeting a Tamil small businessman.         
	Reports have said his son, Charles Anthony, has escaped by submarine and it is possible he may attempt the same.

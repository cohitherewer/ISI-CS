	Washington, Sept. 11: A US Coast Guard training exercise today that posed no public threat led to erroneous television reports that authorities had fired on a recreational vessel in the Potomac river, Washington DC police said.        
	The incident, which coincided with national commemorations of the terror attacks of September 11, 2001, prompted a short halt of departing flights at nearby Reagan National Airport.        
	Federal Aviation Administration spokeswoman Diane Spitaliere said the 22-minute pause, beginning at 10:08am, was based on reports of activity on the Potomac, as a precaution. She said she didnt know whether the decision was based on media reports or information from law enforcement authorities.        
	Live coverage of the incident on CNN, Fox and other media outlets cited police radio transmissions in which officers allegedly ordered shots fired. Television anchors and analysts speculated on-air as to whether the allegedly suspicious vessel confronted by the coast guard could be linked to the anniversary of the attacks.        
	But a coast guard spokesman said the exercise did not involve gunfire of any kind. Officials said listeners may have misinterpreted a police radio transmission in which a coast guard officer said: Bang, bang, bang.

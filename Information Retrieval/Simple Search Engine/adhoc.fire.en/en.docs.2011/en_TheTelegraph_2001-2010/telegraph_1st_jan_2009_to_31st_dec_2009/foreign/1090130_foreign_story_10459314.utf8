	Dhaka, Jan. 29 (Reuters): Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina said yesterday she planned to push to set up a south Asia task force to combat the growing menace of terrorism in the region.        
	The move comes at a time when regional countries including Bangladesh, India, Pakistan, Sri Lanka and Afghanistan have faced increased terror attacks and growing threats from various militant groups.        
	I have already instructed the authorities concerned (in Bangladesh) to take the initiative to form the South Asian Anti-terrorist Task Force which will create scope for tracing militants and put them on trial, Hasina said.

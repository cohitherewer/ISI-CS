	Mingora, Pakistan, Feb. 22 (Agencies): Taliban militants kidnapped a top government administrator and six of his guards in Pakistans northwestern Swat valley today.        
	A PTI report said Khushal Khan was released after being detained for four hours.        
	The kidnapping of Khan, the district coordination officer of Swat, set back government hopes of curbing violence in the restive valley.        
	He was travelling by car to Mingora, the main town of Swat, when he was abducted by miscreants, Syed Mohammad Jawed, the commissioner for the Malakand division which includes Swat, said.        
	Taliban spokesperson Muslim Khan, however, claimed the official was not kidnapped and had been stopped by the militants so that he could be their guest for tea.        
	Authorities in North West Frontier Province announced plans to give people weapons for self-defence after a deal with a leading cleric of Swat, Maulana Sufi Mohammad, to restore Islamic laws in the hope that he would persuade the militants to give up fighting.        
	The provinces chief minister, Amir Haider Khan Hoti, said in a statement the government would distribute 30,000 rifles in rural areas to help villagers tackle terrorism.        
	Pakistans Prime Minister Yousaf Raza Gilani instructed authorities to ensure the early and safe recovery of the administrator and his guards.        
	The Prime Minister also directed the law enforcing agencies to keep a strong vigil on the anti-state elements who wanted to impede the governments efforts for restoration of peace and tranquillity in Swat and adjoining areas, Gilanis office said in a statement.

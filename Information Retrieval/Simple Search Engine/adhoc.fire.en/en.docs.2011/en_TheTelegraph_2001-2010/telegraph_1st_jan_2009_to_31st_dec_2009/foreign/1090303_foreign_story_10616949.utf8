	Speed camera fear    
	 London, March 2: Motorist Colin Gant has been forced to seek counselling to help cure a bizarre phobia of speed cameras, reports The Daily Telegraph.       
	Despite being an advanced driver who has never had a speeding ticket, Gant is terrified of the fixed-point Gatsos  just in case they incorrectly flash him. Driving 500 miles a week, he regularly takes huge detours to avoid camera sites and said that if he sees a speed camera he suffers a panic attack and has to pull over.       
	The situation became so serious that eventually he was invited by a local camera safety partnership team for a behind the scenes look at how the cameras worked.

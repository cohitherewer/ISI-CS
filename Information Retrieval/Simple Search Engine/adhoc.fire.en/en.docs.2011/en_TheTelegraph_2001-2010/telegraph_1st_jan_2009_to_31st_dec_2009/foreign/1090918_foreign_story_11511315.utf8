                              Mary Travers                            
	Boston, Sept. 17 (AP): Mary Travers, of the folk trio Peter, Paul and Mary, that used beautiful, tranquil harmonies to convey the angst and turmoil of the Vietnam anti-war movement, racial discrimination and more, died after a battle with leukaemia. She was 72.        
	The bands publicist, Heather Lylis, said Travers died yesterday at Danbury Hospital in Connecticut. Bandmate Peter Yarrow said that in her final months, Travers handled her declining health with bravery and generosity, showing her love to friends and family with great dignity.        
	It was, as Mary always was, honest and completely authentic, he said. Thats the way she sang, too  honestly and with complete authenticity.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Asia goes on alert against flu
                                                                                                               Asia goes on alert against flu
                            
	Mexico City, April 26 (Agencies): Fears of a global flu pandemic grew as suspected cases appeared in several countries, including upto 81 people who died in Mexico, where millions hid indoors to avoid contamination.        
	While all the deaths so far have been in Mexico, the flu is spreading in the US and possible infections popped up as far afield as Europe and New Zealand.        
	Many Asian countries went on alert after the WHO declared a public health emergency of international concern. Several countries issued travel notices and tightened restrictions.        
	In New Zealand, officials said 22 students and three teachers, who returned from a three-week-long language trip to Mexico, may have been infected with the virus. Australia urged people who had recently returned from Mexico and had developed flu-like symptoms to seek medical advice.        
	In the UK, authorities stressed that a crew member who developed flu-like symptoms during a flight from Mexico City to Heathrow did not test positive for swine flu. In Israel, doctors are running tests on a man who recently returned from Mexico with light flu symptoms.        
	A pandemic will deal a big blow to a world economy already suffering its worst recession in decades, and experts say it could cost trillions of dollars.

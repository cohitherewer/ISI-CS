The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | AIG lists banks that were saved
                                                                                                               AIG lists banks that were saved
          MARY WILLIAMS WALSH                          The AIG building in New York. (AP)                                  
	New York, March 16: Amid rising pressure from Congress and taxpayers, the American International Group yesterday released the names of dozens of financial institutions that benefited from the Federal Reserves decision last autumn to save the giant insurer from collapse with a huge rescue loan.        
	Financial companies that received multibillion-dollar payments owed by AIG include Goldman Sachs ($12.9 billion), Merrill Lynch ($6.8 billion), Bank of America ($5.2 billion), Citigroup ($2.3 billion) and Wachovia ($1.5 billion).         
	Big foreign banks also received large sums from the rescue, including Socit Grale of France and Deutsche Bank of Germany, which each received nearly $12 billion; Barclays of Britain ($8.5 billion); and UBS of Switzerland ($5 billion).         
	AIG also named the 20 largest states, starting with California, that stood to lose billions last autumn because AIG was holding money they had raised with bond sales.         
	In total, AIG named nearly 80 companies and municipalities that benefited most from the Fed rescue, though many more that received smaller payments were left out.        
	The list, long sought by lawmakers, was released a day after the disclosure that AIG was paying out hundreds of millions of dollars in bonuses to executives at the AIG division where the companys crisis originated.         
	That drew anger from Democratic and Republican lawmakers alike yesterday and left the Obama administration scrambling to distance itself from AIG.        
	There are a lot of terrible things that have happened in the last 18 months, but whats happened at AIG is the most outrageous, Lawrence H. Summers, an economic adviser to President Obama who was treasury secretary in the Clinton administration, said yesterday on This Week on ABC.         
	He said the administration had determined that it could not stop the bonuses.        
	But some members of Congress expressed outrage over the bonuses. Representative Elijah E. Cummings, a Democrat of Maryland who had demanded more information about the bonuses last December, accused the companys chief executive, Edward M. Liddy, of rewarding reckless business practices.        
	AIG has been trying to play the American people for fools by giving nearly $1 billion in bonuses by the name of retention payments, Cummings said yesterday. These payments are nothing but a reward for obvious failure, and it is an egregious offence to have the American taxpayers foot the bill.         
	An AIG spokeswoman said yesterday that the company would not identify the recipients of these bonuses, citing privacy obligations.        
	Ever since the insurers rescue began, with the Feds $85 billion emergency loan last autumn, there have been demands for a full public accounting of how the money was used. The taxpayer assistance has now grown to $170 billion, and the government owns nearly 80 per cent of the company.         
	But the insurance giant has refused until now to disclose the names of its trading partners, or the amounts they received, citing business confidentiality.        
	AIG finally relented after consulting with the companies that received the government support. The companys chief executive, Edward M. Liddy, said yesterday: Our decision to disclose these transactions was made following conversations with the counterparties and the recognition of the extraordinary nature of these transactions.        
	Still, the disclosure is not likely to calm the ire aimed at the company and its trading partners. The Fed chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, appearing on 60 Minutes on CBS last night, said: Of all the events and all of the things weve done in the last 18 months, the single one that makes me the angriest, that gives me the most angst, is the intervention with AIG.

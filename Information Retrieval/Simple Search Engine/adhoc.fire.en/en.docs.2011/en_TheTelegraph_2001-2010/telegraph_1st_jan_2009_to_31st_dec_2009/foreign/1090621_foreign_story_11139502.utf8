The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Collider restart in autumn
                                                                                                               Collider restart in autumn
                            
	Geneva, June 20 (Reuters): The giant sub-atomic particle collider built to reproduce Big Bang conditions is set to restart this autumn, the European Organisation for Nuclear Research, Cern, said yesterday.        
	Scientists believe they have figured out how to prevent a repeat of the problems that caused the 10 billion $9.2 billion Large Hadron Collider to be shut down just nine days after it was switched on last September, Cern expert Steve Myers said.

	 London, Nov. 7: A soldier has become the new Miss England after the winner of the title, Rachel Christie, stepped down following her arrest over an alleged nightclub brawl, reports The Daily Telegraph.       
	Lance Corporal Katrina Hodge, the first runner-up in the 2009 national contest, was given the crown after Christie, 21, stepped down as she wanted to concentrate on clearing her name.       
	Hodge has been given leave from her duties as a soldier in the British Army and will represent England in the Miss World Final in Johannesburg in December.    
	Parker love     
	 Los Angeles (PTI): Actress Sarah Jessica Parker loves to take care of her twins so much that she even enjoys the smell of their dirty diapers. The actress is mother to twin daughters, Loretta and Tabitha. I love the smell of diapers, I even like when they are wet and you smell them all warm, Parker said.

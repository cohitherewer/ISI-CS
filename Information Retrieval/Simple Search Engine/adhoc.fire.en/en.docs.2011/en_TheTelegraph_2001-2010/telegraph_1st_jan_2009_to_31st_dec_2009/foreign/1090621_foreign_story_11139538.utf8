	London, June 20: Governor Arnold Schwarzeneggers plane was forced to make an emergency landing last evening after the pilot reported smoke in the cockpit.         
	 The jet was about 10 minutes away from landing at the Santa Monica Airport when the pilot reported smoke coming from an instrument panel, said Aaron McLear, the governors spokesman. The pilot made a quick, steep, but safe landing at 6.23 pm at Van Nuys Airport in the San Fernando Valley, McLear said.         
	Upon landing, Schwarzenegger immediately shared news of his little adventure with the world by sending a tweet to the microblogging website Twitter. The former body builder and film star also posted a link to a photo of the jet parked on the runway on his Twitter feed. Alls OK, though, he wrote.

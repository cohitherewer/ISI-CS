	Kathmandu, Nov. 11 (PTI): A Nepali woman minister slapped a senior district official five times on his face over an old car that she was supposed to use during her official tour of the southern districts.  
	Minister of state for agriculture Karima Begum admitted before reporters that she slapped the chief administrator of Parsa district, Durga Prasad Bhandari, five times after he ignored her telephone calls and failed to provide a new car for her tour. Yes, I slapped the chief district administrator as he ignored my telephone calls and failed to provide a luxury vehicle for my tour, Karima Begum told journalists.  
	Later, the minister told PTI: When I asked him about the vehicle he argued with me. I slapped him five times in order to make him aware of his duties.        
	How can officials insult ministers, she said.        
	Karima Begum, who belongs to the Madhesi Party and a constituent of the new ruling coalition, was on an official tour of southern Nepal to attend meetings when the incident occurred.        
	She was upset after Bhandari sent an old car to pick her up at the Simara airport yesterday. The home ministry issued a statement regretting the incident. However, as a result of the incident, all government offices in Bara and Parsa districts were closed yesterday.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Husband charged with wifes murder
                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      Husband charged with wifes murder
          AMIT ROY                                          Harpreet Aulakh and   his wife Geeta      
	London, Dec. 12: The Indian husband, who insisted he could not possibly be the killer of his wife because he loved her very much, was tonight charged with her murder.        
	 Harpreet Aulakh, 31, will appear before Feltham Magistrates Court next week charged with the murder of his 28-year-old wife, Geeta Aulakh, who had split from him nearly a year ago after 11 years of marriage and was seeking a divorce.        
	 There have been a number of brutal Indian murder cases in England but Geetas is bizarre.        
	 She was found by a passerby on a street pavement in Greenford, north-west London, on November 16, with severe head injuries. Her right hand had been hacked off by a sword or a machete like instrument, said police, who immediately pulled in 11 men, including her husband, for questioning.        
	 After being released, Harpreet had spoken to journalists and said he was innocent.        
	 Expressing grief and anger in equal measure, Harpreet declared: I love Geeta and I would never hurt her. Im disgusted. I had nothing to do with it. CCTV (close circuit television) proves I was in a pub at the time. I was nowhere near the crime scene. The police arrested me because I helped them with a gang-related crime years ago, a shooting in Hounslow, and they had me on file that way. Im going to find out who did this and those people will pay. I will make sure they are sorry, even if it takes the rest of my life.        
	 One of the police lines of inquiry will be whether Geeta was attacked on Harpreets behalf.        
	 A youth of 18, Sher Singh, of Southall, has already appeared in court charged with murder and was remanded in custody to appear at the Old Bailey on March 1.        
	 A second man arrested yesterday has been bailed to a west London police station on a date in mid January. This means the police would like more time to investigate him so that he can either be charged or cleared.        
	 It seems Geeta was attacked by assailants familiar with her movements. She was attacked in Braund Avenue, at its junction with Verulam Road, at about 7pm in an Indian area of London. She died in hospital four hours later.        
	 She was walking to pick up her sons, Karam, 10, and Tejdeep, eight, from their childminder after leaving work at Sunrise Radio where she was a receptionist.        
	 Investigators said she was struck repeatedly and her right hand was cut off as she tried to protect herself. Police believe her attackers may have been lying in wait for her in the suburban street.        
	 Harpreet, who was questioned shortly after Geetas death and released on bail, was again arrested last night when police obviously felt they had compelling evidence to bring a murder charge.        
	 Geetas parents, Lakhwinder and Nardesh Shinh, and her younger sister, Anita, Shinh, have given a news conference when they said they were living through a nightmare. They added that Geetas sons had not entirely understood what had happened to their mother.        
	 They revealed that Geeta had been threatened in the last few months of her life though they had not learnt the details from her.

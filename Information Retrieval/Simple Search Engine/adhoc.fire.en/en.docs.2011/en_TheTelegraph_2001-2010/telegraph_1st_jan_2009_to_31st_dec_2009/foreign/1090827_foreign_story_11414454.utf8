The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Sharon defends right to strip
                                                                                                               Sharon defends right to strip
                              Not provocative                            
	London, Aug. 26 (PTI): Actress Sharon Stone has blasted critics of her topless pictures, saying that the right to strip does not lie with young actresses only.         
	The Basic Instinct star has bared all for the cover of French fashion magazine Paris Match (www.parismatch.com) sporting nothing but bondage heels and underwear for the provocative shoot.         
	The 51-year-old actress is adamant that she has every right to show off her body without facing harsh criticism about her age.         
	Is there an age when youre supposed to refrain from doing some things like showing your body? If someone is shocked by these photos thats a reflection on his own views on age.        
	What these photos represent is nothing surprising to me, my life didnt change at 50, I didnt change. I dont see where the provocation is. If I asked myself I probably wouldnt have done these photos as I dont consider myself provocative, Stone added.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Saudi scribe flogging scrapped
                                                                                                               Saudi scribe flogging scrapped
                            
	Riyadh, Oct. 26 (AP): The Saudi king has waived a punishment of 60 lashes for a female journalist charged with involvement in a TV show in which a Saudi man publicly talked about sex, a government official said today.        
	King Abdullahs decision followed intense media attention sparked by Saturdays sentencing of journalist Rozanna al-Yami, who was ordered flogged by a judge in the western city of Jeddah.        
	 Al-Yami had been charged with involvement in the preparation of a sex talk show and advertising the segment on the Internet. Public talk about sex is taboo in this ultra-conservative country, where the sexes are segregated.        
	Al-Yami  believed to be the first Saudi woman journalist to get a flogging punishment  said Saturday that although the charges against her were dropped, the judge sentenced her as a deterrence.

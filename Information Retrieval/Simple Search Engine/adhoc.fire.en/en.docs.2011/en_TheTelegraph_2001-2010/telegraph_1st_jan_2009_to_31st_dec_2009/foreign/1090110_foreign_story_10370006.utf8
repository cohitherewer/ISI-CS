	Chicago, Jan. 9 (Reuters): The Illinois House of Representatives impeached Governor Rod Blagojevich today for abuse of power, including a charge that he tried to sell President-elect Barack Obamas former Senate seat.        
	The Democratic-controlled House voted 114 to one to impeach the two-term Democrat.

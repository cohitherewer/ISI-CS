	Dallas, July 14 (AP): Southwest Airlines inspected nearly 200 planes and put them back in the sky today after a 30-cm hole opened in the cabin of an identical jet, forcing the aircraft to make an emergency landing in West Virginia.        
	Passengers aboard a Nashville-to-Baltimore flight yesterday said they could see through the hole above them, just in front of the planes tail.         
	The cabin lost pressure, but no one was injured on the flight, which carried 126 passengers and five crew members. Passenger Michael Cunningham told NBCs Today show today that he had dozed off in his seat in mid-cabin when he was awakened by the loudest roar Id ever heard.        
	Cunningham said the hole was above his seat. People stayed calm and put on the oxygen masks that dropped from the ceiling. After we landed in Charleston, the pilot came out and looked up through the hole, and everybody applauded, shook his hand, a couple of people gave him hugs, he said.        
	 The National Transportation Safety Board sent an investigator to the scene to interview the crew and examine maintenance and inspection records.        
	, but could take months to find a cause.

	Rear-end strain    
	 Berlin, April 25 (Reuters): German finance minister Peer Steinbrueck said the hardest part of his 15-hour per day job is the long meetings  because they put a strain on a sensitive part of his anatomy.      
	There are some meetings that are so incredibly long that at some point your rear end starts to hurt, Steinbrueck told a group of young school children in an interview for the Welt am Sonntag newspaper to be published tomorrow.      
	The four Berlin students, aged 11 to 13, had asked the minister if he ever got tired of his job after he said he has to work up to 14 or 15 hours almost every day of the week. Yes, sometimes I get really shirty, he said when asked if he ever got sick and tired of his job.

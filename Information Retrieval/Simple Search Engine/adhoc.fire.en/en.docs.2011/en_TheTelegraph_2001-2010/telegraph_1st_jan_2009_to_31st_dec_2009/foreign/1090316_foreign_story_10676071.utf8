	Old age at 27    
	 London, March 15: Old age begins at 27 as mental powers start to decline, according to scientists.       
	Researchers have found that peoples mental abilities peak at 22 before beginning to deteriorate just five years later.      
	Professor Timothy Salthouse said the results suggested that therapies designed to prevent or reverse age-related conditions may need to start earlier.      
	Two thousand respondents, aged between 18-60, were asked to solve visual puzzles, recall words and story details and spot patterns in letters and symbols.       
	The research by the University of Virginia found that in nine out of 12 tests the average age at which the top performance was achieved was 22. The first age at which performance was significantly lower than the peak scores was 27. Memory was shown to decline from the average age of 37.

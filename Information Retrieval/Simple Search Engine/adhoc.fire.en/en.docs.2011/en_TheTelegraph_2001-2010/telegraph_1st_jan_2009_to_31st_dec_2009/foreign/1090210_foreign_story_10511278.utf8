	Colombo, Feb. 9 (AP): A suspected rebel suicide bomber killed 20 soldiers and eight civilians when she blew herself up today at a facility where government forces were processing Sri Lankans fleeing the northern war zone, the military said.        
	The bombing was the first major suicide attack in Sri Lanka in more than a month and led to fears the Tamil Tiger separatists  boxed in by the military and on the verge of defeat  will increasingly turn to guerrilla warfare in their battle against government forces.        
	Following a string of victories, the military backed the rebels into a small strip of land on the northeastern coast, where the Red Cross estimates 250,000 civilians are also trapped.        
	This morning, more than 800 civilians had crossed the front lines and were being searched by soldiers before being sent to camps farther south, military spokesman Brig. Udaya Nanayakkara said.        
	When the attacker was frisked, she set off the bomb she was wearing, killing 28 people, he said. The blast also wounded 24 troops and 40 civilians, the brigadier said.        
	Footage run on state television showed a child in a purple checked dress lying lifeless on the ground.         
	Other civilians lay dead nearby. Plastic chairs they were apparently sitting in as they waited to be processed were overturned, and blood stained the ground.        
	The LTTE is now desperate because they dont have any control over the civilians now, Nanayakkara said. They wanted to stop these people coming in.        
	Confirmation of the attack was not available because independent journalists were barred from the war zone.        
	The UN condemned the bombing. We deplore the loss of civilian life in this targeted killing. Its a blow for people who have suffered so much, UN resident coordinator Neil Buhne said.        
	The attack appeared aimed at one of the militarys weak points, the processing of the masses of civilians trying to flee the area.        
	It also highlighted concerns that the rebels were trying to blend in with the civilian population, so they can fight on using insurgent tactics. The military has said the flow of civilians out of the war zone has increased in recent days, with 4,700 fleeing yesterday, bringing the total number of non-combatants to escape the war zone to 20,000 this year, Nanayakkara said.        
	With most communication to the north severed, the rebels could not be reached for comment. The rebels have been accused of more than 200 suicide attacks and are listed as a terror group by the US.        
	The Tamil Tigers have been fighting since 1983 for a separate state for the nations ethnic Tamil minority after decades of marginalisation at the hands of governments controlled by the Sinhalese majority.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Tiger chief missed by whisker

	Pudukudiyirippu (Sri Lanka), April 25 (PTI): Lankan security forces missed Tamil Tiger chief Vellupilai Prabhakaran and his top aides by a whisker, a top Sri Lankan commander said.        
	The 58th Army Division commander, Brigadier Shavendra Silva, told journalists that the rebel leader had limited options  either to give up or commit suicide.        
	We got to know that Prabhakaran had moved through the Pudukudiryirippu road on a day between March 29 to 31, just about two days before the army siege in that area, Silva said. Yes I regret we missed him by a whisker or else things could have been over faster, he said, adding that Prabhakaran cannot escape by road.        
	Silva said things have worsened to such an extent that mothers were hiding their sons in a holes inside the kitchen to escape the prying eyes of Tiger militants who were on the lookout for new fighters.        
	Former LTTE media coordinator Daya Master told the army during interrogation that only Sea Tiger leader Soosai, the coordinating LTTE army head Pottu Amman and Prabhakarans son Charles Anthony are going to stay with him.         
	The rest of the senior aides will try to escape as I did, Silva quoted Daya Master as saying.        
	Yes Prabhakaran lived around here not far ago and people suffered under him, Silva told journalists who visited the war zone.        
	According to another senior military officer, Prabhakaran is facing reverses after reverses in his struggle for a separate Eelam state.         
	Many Tiger cadres have been forced to give their lives under duress since Prabhakaran introduced suicide bombers, mostly young women, and targeted major government installations, including military headquarters and international airport in Sri Colombo, Silva said.         
	The journalists were also allowed a brief chat with fleeing Tamil civilians passing through Pudukudiyirippu.        
	The LTTE do not tell us anything. We are very scared of the puligal (Tigers) who have sophisticated weapons and other materials. How can we think of escaping? a civilian, who called himself Arumugam, said.        
	A lady, who fled the no-fire zone along with her four-year-old grandson, said they had had enough of gunfire sounds. Enough is enough. We hope to live in peace at least from now on, she said.         
	The drive from Kilinochchi, the former political capital of the rebels, to Pudukudiyiruppu revealed deserted villages and scenes of total devastation. An elderly man said both sides were shelling them. We are under attack from both the sides, he said.

                                                                                                               11 killed in Lanka attack on hospital

	Colombo, Feb. 2 (AP): Artillery shells slammed into an overcrowded hospital for the second day in Sri Lankas northern war zone, bringing the death toll to at least 11 people, officials said today.        
	In a message to mark the 61st Independence Day that will be celebrated on Wednesday, President Mahinda Rajapakse said: The strongholds of terror once believed to be invincible... have fallen in rapid succession, bringing the final elimination of terror from our motherland and the dawn of true freedom to all our people well within our reach.        
	The attacks on the hospital intensified concern for the fate of some 250,000 civilians trapped in the shrinking war zone where the Tamil Tigers have been boxed in. The Sri Lankan army believes it is on the verge of destroying the rebels and ending one of the longest running civil wars in the world.        
	In the chaos of war, where claims and counterclaims have become impossible to verify independently, the Tamil Tigers said they killed 150 soldiers and injured more than 300 since yesterday. The army denied it lost any men.        
	There is no truth to that. There were small confrontations, but we didnt suffer any casualties, military spokesman Brig. Udaya Nanayakkara told The Associated Press.        
	The fighting is taking place in Puthukkudiyiruppu area, where three artillery barrages slammed into the pediatrics and womens wards of the Puthukkudiyiruppu hospital yesterday, the Red Cross said.        
	The shells, which also hit a kitchen and a chapel, killed nine patients yesterday and wounded 20, Red Cross spokeswoman Sarasi Wijeratne said today.        
	 Kandasamy Tharmakulasingham, a local health official, confirmed the attacks, and said more shells hit the hospital this morning, killing two more people and wounding six others. Sarasi and Tharmakulasingham couldnt say who fired the shells.        
	But Dr Thurairajah Varatharajah, the top government health official in the area, said two of the attacks appeared to have come from the army.        
	He said the shelling caused extensive damage to the overcrowded hospital, one of the last functioning health institutions inside rebel-held territory. The UN confirmed the hospital was struck yesterday by artillery shells throughout the day. It seems to have struck the pediatric ward, a 30-bed ward filled to overflowing, UN spokesman Gordon Weiss said. He did not cast blame on either side.        
	Nanayakkara said the army was not responsible for the attacks and accused the rebels, formally known as the LTTE, of desperately firing artillery shells at random.        
	He said troops discovered yesterday an underground three-room apartment in Vishwamadu village, fitted with a luxury bathroom, high quality furnishings, a generator and electrical appliances.        
	We believe it belongs to LTTE leader (Velupillai) Prabhakaran, he said. With the luxury items which we have come across there, it definitely has to be the leaders house.

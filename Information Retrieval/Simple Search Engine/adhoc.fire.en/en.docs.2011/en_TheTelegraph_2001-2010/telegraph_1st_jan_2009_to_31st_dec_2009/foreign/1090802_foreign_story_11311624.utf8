	Shanghai, Aug. 1 (Reuters): No scars, no history of serious illness in the last three generations of your family, and no tooth cavities.        
	These are amongst the 100 health requirements for would-be astronauts vying to be part of Chinas next space team, the Yangtse Evening Paper reported today. The selection process, which the paper said is for the second batch of Chinese astronauts, will disqualify those who have runny noses, ringworm, drug allergies or bad breath. The bad smell would affect their fellow colleagues in a narrow space, said Shi Bing Bing, an official with the 454th hospital of the Peoples Liberation Army air force based in Nanjing, one of the six astronaut health screening hospitals. Aside from the physical requirements of the job, the candidate must also possess a pleasant and adaptable disposition, the paper said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Apple juice is flowing 
                                                                                                               Apple juice is flowing 
  - Bated-breath wait for show                            Jobs                                  
	Los Angeles, Sept. 8 (AP): Once again, its time to peer into Apple CEO Steve Jobss cup and try to read the tea leaves.        
	Apple, as usual, has said almost nothing about the new products it plans to unveil at an invitation-only affair tomorrow in San Francisco. Playing their part, bloggers and Apple fans have filled the vacuum with leaks, rumours and wish-list items that, while often far-fetched, cant completely be ignored.         
	Sometimes, just sometimes, a bit of truth shines through. In recent years, the California-based company has used its September event to unveil new iPods, which have grown smaller, sleeker and more powerful with each new generation.         
	This years event is along the same lines, if Apples email to reporters is any indication.        
	The invitation looks like an iTunes gift card and features one of Apples iconic, iPod-toting silhouettes and the words: Its only rock and roll, but we like it, a reference to a 1970s Rolling Stones song.That still left room for creative speculation.        
	Detail-starved bloggers took a close look at the image and noted that the headphones jack into the large-ish iPod at the bottom  making it an iPod Touch, not an iPod classic.         
	The observation has added weight to one rumour that Apple could discontinue the classic, the only model left to use a hard drive instead of flash memory.        
	Of course, other rumours postulate an even bigger hard drive on an updated iPod classic, which already boasts a 120-GB hard drive, far beefier than any other iPod. Still more speculation, this time based on what appear to be photos of new iPod cases, call for built-in digital cameras on Touch and Nano models.        
	Apple watchers are also looking out for the ninth incarnation of iTunes, the media management software that helps people keep track of their music, videos, podcasts and data and send it to iPods and iPhones.        
	One more thing: CEO Jobs hasnt presided over one of these pep-rally-style product launches since Apple gave its laptop line a light makeover last October.         
	But now that Jobs is back from his nearly six-month medical leave, fans are still holding their breath for an appearance from the maestro.

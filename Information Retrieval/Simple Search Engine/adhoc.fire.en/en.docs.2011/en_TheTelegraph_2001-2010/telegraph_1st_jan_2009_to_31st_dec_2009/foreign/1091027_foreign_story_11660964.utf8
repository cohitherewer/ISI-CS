The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Pak detains 11 Guards on Iran border
                                                                                                               Pak detains 11 Guards on Iran border
                            
	Quetta, Oct. 26 (Reuters): Pakistani forces detained 11 Iranian Revolutionary Guards today for crossing into Pakistan.        
	The Guards were arrested in the Mashkhel area on the border with Iran eight days after a suicide bomber killed 42 people, including six Revolutionary Guard commanders, in Irans southeastern Sistan-Baluchestan province.        
	A Sunni group Jundollah (Gods soldiers), claimed responsibility for the blast. Iran says the group operates from across the border in Pakistan. On Tuesday last week, a senior Revolutionary Guards commander said his force should be given permission to confront terrorists inside Pakistan, state media reported.        
	Its a serious matter. We are investigating why they crossed into our territory, said a Pakistani border security official.

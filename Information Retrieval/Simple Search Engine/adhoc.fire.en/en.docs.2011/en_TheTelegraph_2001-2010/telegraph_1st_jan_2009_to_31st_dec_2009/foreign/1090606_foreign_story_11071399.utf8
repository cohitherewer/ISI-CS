	 Washington, June 5: The East Wing of the White House has had its first staff upheaval four months into the Barack Obama administration: First Lady Michelle Obama has replaced chief of staff Jackie Norris with White House lawyer Susan Sher.       
	The White House made the announcement yesterday in a news release and offered no explanation for the change, reports The Washington Post.       
	 a statement, Michelle described both women as her friends. But in this instance, Sher, a longtime friend from Chicago, trumped Norris, the relatively new one from Iowa.

	Tehran, Oct. 18 (Reuters): A suicide bomber killed six commanders of the Revolutionary Guards and 29 others today near the Pakistani border in one of the boldest attacks on Irans most powerful military institution.        
	The attack highlighted deepening instability in a southeastern region of mainly Shia Muslim Iran bordering Pakistan and Afghanistan. Many minority Sunnis live in the impoverished area, which has seen an upsurge in bombings and other violence.        
	President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad said those behind the attack would be seriously dealt with and called on Pakistan to help catch and hand them over.         
	Iran has in the past said members of Jundollah (Gods soldiers), a rebel Sunni group that has claimed responsibility for the attack, were operating from Pakistan.        
	We were informed that some security agents in Pakistan are co-operating with the main elements of this terrorist incident, Fars News Agency quoted the President as saying. We ask the Pakistani government not to delay any longer in the apprehension of the main elements in this terrorist attack.        
	The foreign ministry summoned a senior Pakistani diplomat in Tehran and said there was evidence the perpetrators came to Iran from Pakistan.        
	The Pakistani official assured Tehran his country would take all measures to secure its border with Iran, state television said.        
	The attack also wounded about 30 people ahead of a meeting with tribal chiefs.        
	The talks were part of efforts to foster Shia-Sunni unity and the Guards said the attack was aimed at fomenting sectarian strife in Sistan-Baluchestan province.        
	Iranian officials also accused the US and Britain of involvement, a charge rejected by Washington. Tehran says the US backs Jundollah to stir trouble in the border area and has also linked the group to Sunni Islamist al Qaida.        
	The armed forces headquarters issued a statement warning of revenge.        
	The deputy head of the Guards ground forces, General Nourali Shoushtari, and its commander in Sistan-Baluchestan province, General Rajabali Mohammadzadeh, were among the dead.

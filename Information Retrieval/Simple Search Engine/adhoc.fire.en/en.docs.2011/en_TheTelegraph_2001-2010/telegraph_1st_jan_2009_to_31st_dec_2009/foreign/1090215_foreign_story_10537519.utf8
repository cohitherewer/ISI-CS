The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Major victory
                                                                                                               Major victory
                            
	Washington, Feb. 14 (Reuters): The US Congress, handing President Barack Obama a major legislative victory, approved yesterday a $787 billion stimulus bill that aims to rush emergency government spending and tax cuts to a nation in the grip of a severe recession.        
	The Senate cast the final vote, 60-38, hours after the House of Representatives passed an identical bill, 246-183. The action capped weeks of arguing over how Congress could best stimulate an economy suffering a rising jobless rate of 7.6 per cent and a banking crisis that has nearly frozen lending.        
	It will not fix our problems overnight, Senate Appropriations Committee chairman Daniel Inouye, a Hawaii Democrat, said shortly before the final vote began on the measure, closely watched by financial markets and governments around the world. But Inouye added: It will begin the process ... it will give America confidence that we can overcome this crisis. The Senate voting was held open for several hours to await Ohio Democratic Senator Sherrod Browns arrival in Washington to cast the 60th vote needed for passage. The White House arranged for a government plane to fly him back from services for his late mother in Ohio.

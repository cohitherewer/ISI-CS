The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Bigger breasts from stem cells
                                                                                                               Bigger breasts from stem cells
                            
	London, March 29 (PTI): Forget artificial implants. You will soon be able to enlarge your breasts naturally, thanks to scientists who have developed a new stem cell therapy which can boost a womans cup while reducing her stomach fat.        
	A team at Princess Grace Hospital in Britain has come up with the treatment that involves extracting stem cells from the spare fat on belly or thighs and growing them in a womans breasts, The Sunday Times reported today.        
	During the process, cells are isolated from the excess fat on stomach or thighs and then the concentrated stem cells are mixed with another batch of fat before finally being injected into the breast. However, it could take several months for the breast to achieve the desired size and shape.         
	According to the scientists, an increase of one cup size is likely, with the potential for larger gains.         
	Kefah Mokbel, who is leading the team, said: This (new technique) is a very exciting advance in breast surgery. They (breasts treated with stem cells) feel more natural because this tissue has the same softness as the rest of the breast.         
	A trial, involving 10 breast cancer patients who had their assets removed, has already started in Britain. Another project is underway to check the technique on healthy women seeking breast enlargement.

	Rawalpindi, Nov. 2: A suspected Taliban suicide bomber killed at least 35 people in Rawalpindi today, officials said, as the government announced a reward for the capture, dead or alive, of the groups leaders.        
	Many of those killed were military personnel as the bomb was detonated outside a state-run bank near the Pakistan Army headquarters in Rawalpindi.        
	The motorcycle-borne bomber drove into elderly people, who had come to collect their pensions from the National Bank, and blew himself up. Witnesses said the explosion was so powerful that body parts was thrown all over the nearby buildings.         
	The blast came as the Pakistan government announced rewards of up to $5 million for information leading to the capture, dead or alive, of Pakistan Taliban leader Hakimullah Mehsud and more than a dozen other leaders.         
	A spokeswoman for local rescuers, Deeba Shehnaz told The Telegraph that 35 people were killed and 32 wounded in the attack.         
	We have received consolidated lists of dead people from three different hospitals including the Military Hospital and the Combined Military Hospital,she said.         
	Several military installations and hotels are located near the site of the explosion.        
	Witnesses said at least two military police personnel, five women and several private security guards and passersby were killed. A senior security official said the police found the severed head of the bomber and parts of the suicide jacket.         
	Last month militants launched a brazen attack on the Pakistani army headquarters in Rawalpindi, taking dozens of people hostage before commandos stormed the building and rescued them. Nineteen people, including nine army officials and 10 rebels, were killed.         
	TV stations showed ambulances and police vehicles racing through the streets, sirens wailing. It was a huge blast. Smoke is rising from the scene, Nasir Naqvi, who runs a travel agency near the site of the blast, said.         
	The announcement of the bounty on Hakimullahs head was made through newspaper advertisements as security forces zeroed in on his Tehrik-e-Taliban Pakistan strongholds in South Waziristan.        
	These people are definitely killers of humanity and deserve exemplary punishment, read the frontpage advertisement, with photographs of Hakimullah and seven senior lieutenants, in The News. Help the government of Pakistan so that these people meet their nemesis, it said. A reward of over $600,000 each was announced for Hakimullah and his top aide Wali ur-Rehman.

	The militant attacks forced the UN to pull out most of its expatriate staff and suspend development work in the North West Frontier Province and tribal areas bordering Afghanistan.

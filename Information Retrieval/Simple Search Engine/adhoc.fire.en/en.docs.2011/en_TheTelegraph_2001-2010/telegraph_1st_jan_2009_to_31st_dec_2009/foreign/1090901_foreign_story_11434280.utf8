The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Hollywood A-list feels pinch
                                                                                                               Hollywood A-list feels pinch
          PHILIP SHERWELL AND CAROLINE HEDLEY                                        (From top) Pitt, Johansson, Depp and Roberts                                 
	Los Angeles, Aug. 31: The curtain has come down on guaranteed $20 million pay cheques for A-List Hollywood stars as a series of films starring big name actors failed to deliver at the box office this summer.         
	Denzel Washington, Jim Carrey, Scarlett Johansson and Mickey Rourke are among the celluloid celebrities forced to take dramatic pay cuts or accept a slice of any future movie profits as studios have achieved ticket sale success without a famous name attached.         
	The three biggest US films of the summer have been the latest versions of the Transformer and Harry Potter franchises, starring newcomers Shia LaBoeuf and Daniel Radcliffe, and a computer-animated Pixar offering, Up.         
	But Duplicity (with Julia Roberts), Land of the Lost (Will Ferrell), Imagine That (Edddie Murphy), Funny People (Adam Sandler), Public Enemies (Johnny Depp), The Taking of Pelham 123 (Washington and John Travolta) and even Angels amp; Demons (Tom Hanks) brought in sales that varied from average to abysmal.         
	The one movie luminary to live up to his billing for drawing audiences has been Brad Pitt in Inglourious Basterds  the new violence-packed Quentin Tarantino number that took in $38 million last weekend.         
	In the past, studios believed that if they wanted a box office hit, they needed a big star for presence and visibility, Peter Guber, chairman of Mandalay Pictures production company and former studio chief at Sony Pictures, with films such as Midnight Express, Rain Man and Batman to his name, told The Sunday Telegraph.         
	But this year, weve had a summer filled with sequels, remakes and franchises that dont come with big names. There are still very talented stars of course but not every movie needs them for commercial success.        
	The tough economic climate started the transformation but the revolution in technology and social networking has driven home the fundamental upheavals this summer.         
	For studios reeling from the collapse in lucrative DVD sales, this box office trend has given them the chance to redress the bargaining balance with stars  known in the business as talent  and their representatives. Agents used to deliver take-it-or-leave-it financial demands, but now it is studios that set the price.         
	In Hollywood, there is usually a code of omerta among all parties when it comes to talking specific numbers. But a rare spat over salaries became public recently when Washington, an Oscar winner who only recently joined the $20 million club, reluctantly agreed to a reduced pay cheque for a 20th Century Fox project after initially threatening to walk away.         
	Disney reportedly ditched Julia Roberts for Sandra Bullock when she would not cut her salary  believed to be around the $15 million mark until recently  to star in the recent comedy hit The Proposal.        
	Scarlett Johansson and Mickey Rourke apparently accepted $400,000 each plus a take of profits to appear in Iron Man 2.

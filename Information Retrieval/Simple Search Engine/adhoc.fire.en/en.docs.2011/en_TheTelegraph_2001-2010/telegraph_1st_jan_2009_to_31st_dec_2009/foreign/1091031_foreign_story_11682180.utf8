	Rome, Oct. 30: The Vatican has condemned Halloween as anti-Christian, saying it is based on a sinister and dangerous undercurrent of occultism.        
	The Holy See has warned that parents should not allow their children to dress up as ghosts and ghouls tomorrow, calling Halloween a pagan celebration of terror and fear.        
	The Roman Catholic church has become alarmed in recent years by the spread of Halloween traditions from the US to other countries around the world. The Vatican issued the warning through its official newspaper, LOsservatore Romano, in an article headlined Halloweens Dangerous Messages.

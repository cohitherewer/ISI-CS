	Los Angeles, Aug. 5 (Agencies): Two American journalists freed by North Korea after months of detention returned home to a tearful family reunion today.        
	They were accompanied by former President Bill Clinton, who secured their release in a meeting with reclusive leader Kim Jong-il.        
	Laura Ling, 32, and Euna Lee, 36, reporters for an American cable television venture co-founded by Clintons former Vice-President, Al Gore, arrived with Clinton at Burbank airport near Los Angeles aboard a private jet from North Korea.        
	The two Current TV journalists were arrested on March 17 for illegally crossing into the north from China and had been reporting on the trafficking of women. They were both sentenced to 12 years of hard labour in June.         
	 Lee emerged from the jetliner first and was greeted by husband Michael Saldate and 4-year-old daughter Hana. She hugged the girl and picked her up before all three embraced in a crushing hug. Ling embraced her husband, Iain Clayton, as teary family members crowded around.        
	The past 140 days have been the most difficult, heart-wrenching days of our lives, Ling said, her voice cracking. Thirty hours ago, Ling said: We feared that any moment we could be sent to a hard labour camp.        
	Then, she said, they were taken to another location. When we walked through the doors, we saw standing before us President Bill Clinton, she said to applause. We were shocked but we knew instantly in our hearts that the nightmare of our lives was finally coming to an end, and now we stand here, home and free.         
	Clinton came down the stairs to applause. He hugged Gore, then chatted with family members. Gore described the families of the two women as unbelievable, passionate, involved, committed, innovative.        
	Hanas been a great girl while you were gone, he told Lee. And Laura, your moms been making your special soup for two days now. He also thanked the state department for its help in the release. It speaks well of our country that when two American citizens are in harms way, that so many people will just put things aside and just go to work to make sure that this has had a happy ending.

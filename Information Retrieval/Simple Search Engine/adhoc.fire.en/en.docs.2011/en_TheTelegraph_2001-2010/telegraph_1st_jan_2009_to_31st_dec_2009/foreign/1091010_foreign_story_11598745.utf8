The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Probes hit moon twice
                                                                                                               Probes hit moon twice
                                  
	Mountain View (California), Oct. 9 (Reuters): Searching for stocks of water on the moon, Nasa crashed two spacecraft into an eternally dark lunar crater today, hoping to splash ice into the light where instruments could assess it.        
	A two-ton empty rocket stage hit the dark Cabeus crater near the moons south pole at about 1131GMT and a second craft crashed four minutes later. A camera on the following spacecraft did not capture an image of the impact as hoped, but scientists said they were confident that the explosive hit took place as planned.        
	We didnt see a big splashy plume like we wanted to see, said Michael Bicay, director of science at Nasas Ames Research Center.         
	Bicay said an infrared camera showed changes that suggested an explosion.        
	Other instruments on the second craft, a lunar orbiter and telescopes on earth captured data that could show in days whether there was ice on the moon, and the explosion of the second craft was caught by the orbiting and earth-based observers, he said.        
	Three studies released last month found clear evidence of water on the moon, welcome and surprising news for further space exploration. But the skein of water bound with dust that was disclosed then was extremely thin.Its not enough to be of any economic importance, said Nasas Lunar Science Institute director David Morrison.

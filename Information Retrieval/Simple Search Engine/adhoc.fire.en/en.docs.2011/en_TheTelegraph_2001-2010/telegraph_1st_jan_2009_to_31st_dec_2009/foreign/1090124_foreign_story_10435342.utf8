The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Obama to lift abortion ban
                                                                                                               Obama to lift abortion ban

	Washington, Jan. 23 (Reuters): President Barack Obama today will lift restrictions on US government funding for groups that provide abortion services or counselling abroad, reversing a policy of his Republican predecessor George W. Bush, an administration official said.        
	It will be today. Hes going to make an executive order (lifting the global gag rule), the official said.        
	The Democratic Presidents decision is a victory for advocates of abortion rights on an issue that in recent years has become a tit-for-tat policy change each time the White House shifts from one party to the other.        
	When the ban was in place, no US government funding for family planning services could be given to clinics or groups that offer abortion services or counselling in other countries even if the funds for those activities come from non-US government sources.        
	It has been called the Mexico City Policy because it was unveiled at a UN conference there in 1984 and became one of the centrepiece social policies of the conservative administration of former President Ronald Reagan, a Republican.        
	Critics call it the gag rule because it also cuts funds to groups that advocate or lobby for the lifting of abortion restrictions, as they say it infringes on free speech. They also say it has reduced healthcare for some of the worlds poorest women.        
	Former President Bill Clinton, a Democrat, rescinded the rule when he took office in January 1993 and his successor, Republican George W. Bush, reinstated it in January 2001.When he reinstated it, Bush said taxpayer funds should not be used to pay for or advocate abortions.        
	Anti-abortion activists agreed with Bush and criticised the move to lift the ban on funding. When we wake up every morning to a deepening financial crisis, it is an insult to the American people to bail out the abortion industry, said Charmaine Yoest, president of Americans United for Life.        
	Planned Parenthood is a billion dollar company and they do not need additional resources to burden the American taxpayer, she added. The US spends more than $400 million on overseas family planning assistance each year.        
	Hillary calls Pranab        
	The Obama administration made its first contact with India today after secretary of state Hillary Clinton called foreign minister Pranab Mukherjee.         
	Hillary said she was keen to work with Mukherjee and take the relationship between India and the US to a new level. According to a foreign ministry press release, the two leaders agreed that they would strengthen the excellent bilateral relationship between India and the US. Mukherjee invited Hillary to visit India at a convenient date.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Tigers call for UN probe
                                                                                                               Tigers call for UN probe
                            
	Colombo, March 15 (Agencies): The Tamil Tigers today urged the UN to investigate possible war crimes by the military and said it had plenty of evidence to prove its claim.        
	The LTTE, however, made no mention of the world bodys allegations the separatists themselves might be committing the crimes.        
	The Sri Lankan government immediately rejected the call and said the LTTE themselves should be probed.

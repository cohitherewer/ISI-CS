The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Call to free Lanka war victims
                                                                                                               Call to free Lanka war victims
                            
	Colombo, Jan. 30 (Reuters): Pressure rose today for Sri Lanka and the Tamil Tigers to free thousands of people trapped in the war zone, after the President pledged safe passage and urged the rebels to let people move over the next two days.        
	Sri Lankas army has surrounded the separatist group in a 300sqkm slice of jungle in the islands northeast.        
	Aid agencies say 250,000 people are trapped inside the battle zone, and have raised grave concerns for their safety.        
	The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) has said hundreds have been killed or wounded in the fighting since last week. The government says the reported numbers are too high, but has not provided an exact figure.        
	Australias foreign minister Stephen Smith today joined a growing international chorus urging swift action.        
	Australia holds grave concerns for the large number of civilians who remain in the conflict zone. There is an urgent need to ensure their protection, Smith said in a statement, that also welcomed the governments promise of safe passage.        
	Yesterday, President Mahinda Rajapaksa in a statement promised safe passage to all civilians, and urged the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) to let them go within 48 hours.        
	The military said it would not cease combat operations or declare a ceasefire, but would stop shooting to allow civilians to get out as it did for a United Nations-ICRC convoy yesterday that carried out 226 seriously wounded people.        
	The UN said the LTTE had blocked the convoy from leaving two days before, which the Tigers denied.        
	We call upon the LTTE to allow full freedom of movement to all civilians, and to allow safe passage to those wishing to leave the conflict area, a consortium of aid agencies including the UN said in a statement released late yesterday.        
	The groups also asked the government to advise people on safe routes out with international assistance that would provide safety measures for civilians coming out of the conflict zone seeking protection.        
	The government and human rights watchdogs say the LTTE has blocked civilians from leaving, instead forcing them to stay as human shields, fighters or labourers building defences.        
	The LTTE denies that, and says people are staying of their own free will because they fear abuse by the military. The military denies abusing anyone and says more than 2,000 people have fled to safety behind army lines this month.

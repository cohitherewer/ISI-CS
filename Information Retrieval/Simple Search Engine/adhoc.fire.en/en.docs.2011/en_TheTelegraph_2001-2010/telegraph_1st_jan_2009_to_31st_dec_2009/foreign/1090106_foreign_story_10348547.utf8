	Valiant Katie    
	 London, Jan. 5: Katie Holmes has singlehandedly come to the rescue of New Yorks economy, spending 10 million in the city since she moved there six months ago, it has been claimed, reports The Daily Telegraph.      
	The actress arrived in New York in July to appear on Broadway in the Arthur Miller play, All My Sons. She is living in a Manhattan apartment owned by her husband Tom Cruise and has become a regular fixture on the citys social circuit.       
	The New York Posts Page Six magazine estimates that, mainly due to her real estate purchases, she has spent more than 9.6 million since being in the city.       
	While ordinary city dwellers are cutting back, Mrs Cruise has been valiantly doing her bit to boost our economy, the magazine said.       
	We tally up a conservative estimate of her 24-week NYC spending spree, and crown her Manhattans Most Valued Shopper. Holmes has reportedly spent a reported 9,600 on child care .    
	Tool trade    
	 London: Dolphins use tools to forage for food and can pass on the technique through generations, a study has discovered, reports The Daily Telegraph. Dolphins in Shark Bay, Western Australia, put sponges on the end of their noses to protect them from sand as they try and uncover bottom-feeding fish. The dolphins spend some time finding a sponge to fit and much longer foraging for food than other dolphins that do not use the technique. The study found the technique is used almost exclusively by female dolphins.    
	Sex size    
	 London: Size eight women have the most sex, according to a new study, reports The Daily Telegraph. Researchers found that almost 60 per cent of ladies who are a size eight have had sex in the past week, compared to 50 per cent of size 12 women. The figures emerged in a study of the bedroom habits of 3,000 Britons, which also revealed that more than one in 10 people classed as obese havent had sex for a year because they are so worried about being seen naked.     
	Death luck    
	 London: A woman in Connecticut who checked her husbands lottery tickets weeks after his death has discovered he had won a 6.9 million jackpot, reports The Daily Telegraph. Donald Peters, 79, bought two tickets hours before his death from a heart attack in the town of Danbury. But after the retired hat factory workers death his wife, Charlotte, took the slips to the shop to check. On Friday she cashed in one of the tickets.

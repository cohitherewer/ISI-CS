	Colombo, Jan. 18 (Reuters): Prabhakaran, the leader of the Tamil Tigers, may have already fled Sri Lanka with the army charging fast towards the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelams final strongholds, Lieutenant General Sarath Fonseka told reporters yesterday.        
	Fonseka, however, declined to speculate on where the LTTE leader would have fled to.

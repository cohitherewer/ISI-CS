The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Cuba hero, Castro comrade dead
                                                                                                               Cuba hero, Castro comrade dead
                              Juan Almeida                            
	Havana, Sept. 12 (Reuters): One of the original leaders of the Cuban revolution and current vice-president Juan Almeida has died of heart failure at the age of 82, state-run press reported today.        
	Almeida was at the side of Fidel and Raul Castro from the earliest days of the revolution and was the only black commander in the leadership. Fidel Castro took power after the rebels toppled dictator Fulgencio Batista on January 1, 1959, and ruled until Raul Castro succeeded him as President last year.        
	Almeida, who had been in ill health in recent years, died late yesterday, Communist Party newspaper Granma said. Many of Cubas top leaders are about the same age as Almeida, which has raised questions about who will succeed the Castros. Raul Castro is 78, while Fidel Castro is 83.        
	Almeida served in top positions from the beginning of the revolutionary government and at his death was one of several vice-presidents in the Council of State under Raul Castro and a member of the powerful political bureau of the ruling Communist Party.

                                Clooney and Bhutto                           
	Islamabad, Feb. 11 (PTI):Former Prime Minister Benazir Bhuttos niece Fatima Bhutto may be dating Hollywood heartthrob George Clooney, American tabloid National Enquirer reported in its latest issue.        
	Tricky long distance, Pakistan-to-US dating logistics aside, we think the two would make a nice couple. I mean, just look at her CV.         
	Shes a far cry from Clooneys last girlfriend... cocktail waitress and Fear Factor contestant, Sara Larson, the tabloid says.

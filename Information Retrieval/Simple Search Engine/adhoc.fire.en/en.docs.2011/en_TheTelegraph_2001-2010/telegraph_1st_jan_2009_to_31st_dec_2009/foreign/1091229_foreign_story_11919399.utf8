	Dec. 28 (Reuters): The US government has stepped up security measures in the wake of a failed bomb attempt onboard an aircraft on Christmas Day.        
	Following are a list of new measures as reported by some airlines and passengers who have travelled in recent days. The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) gave only limited details of new measures on its website:        
	 On many international flights destined for the US, passengers are being limited to one personal carry-on bag and are asked to check other bags and packages.        
	 Security and screening has been increased across the board. On US-bound international flights, passengers had to go through a second round of security checks at the gate.        
	 On some flights, the screen displaying the map showing the progress and location of the aircraft while in flight was disabled.        
	 In the last hour of flight passengers are being ordered to stow all personal items in the overhead bins and told to remain seated until the airplane lands.        
	 Passengers on some flights were prohibited from having pillows or blankets in their laps during the last hour of flight. They were also told they could not have anything in their laps, including books or magazines, or at their feet for the last hour.        
	 The TSA said on its website that passengers departing from the US would see the same requirements at security checkpoints, but additional airport security measures could be in place.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Storm parallel in Bengal too
                                                                                                               Storm parallel in Bengal too

	New Delhi, June 2: Towering thunderstorms of the kind that Air France officials suspect downed their Flight 447 over the Atlantic yesterday are common in India, particularly Bengal where they are called norwesters, weather scientists and aviators said today.        
	Air France officials have suggested that the Airbus 330-200, flying from Rio de Janeiro to Paris, encountered a severe thunder- storm at an altitude of about 10km.        
	Thunderstorms last only about 30 minutes and stretch horizontally just 15-30km. Their signatures are tall and dense cumulonimbus clouds that can stretch upwards to 20km or higher.        
	Similar thunders- torms are common over the Arabian Sea, Bay of Bengal, and Gangetic West Bengal, said Madhavan Rajeevan, director of an atmospheric radar facility at Gadanki, Andhra Pradesh.        
	The norwesters in gangetic Bengal, however, tend to be more severe than thunderstorms over oceans, thanks to the distinctive topography of the Chhotanagpur region where they are formed.        
	Jamshed Menon, vice-president of the Indian Pilots Guild, said pilots are trained world-wide to avoid or negotiate thunderstorms: When we cant fly above a thunderstorm, we go around it, using gaps to stay out.        
	Strong updrafts and downdrafts, whose speeds can touch up to 30kmph, between the layers of the cumulonimbus clouds and baseball-sized hailstones can make flying into severe thunderstorms dangerous, meteorologists said.        
	The windshield of an Indian Airlines plane suffered a crack after it was hit by hailstones in a severe thunderstorm soon after take-off from Calcutta on May 5, 2005, said D. Pradhan, director of the Doppler weather radar centre in Calcutta.

	Rio de Janeiro, Dec. 24 (Reuters): The 9-year-old boy at the centre of an international custody battle was reunited in Brazil with his American father today and boarded a plane to the US, ending a five-year dispute that tested bilateral ties.        
	David Goldman, the boys father, had fought since 2004 to bring his son home to New Jersey after Bruna Bianchi, his then-wife and Seans mother, brought the boy to her native Brazil and then divorced Goldman. Bianchi died last year, but her second husband and her family sought to keep custody of Sean.        
	A startled-looking Sean Goldman, wearing a T-shirt with Brazils signature green and yellow colours, clutched his stepfather as the two pushed their way through a chaotic mass of reporters to enter the US consulate in downtown Rio de Janeiro where his father was waiting.        
	David Goldman has seen Sean only in brief visits to Brazil since 2004. At times, Sean covered his face from cameras. His teary-eyed Brazilian grandmother, who has campaigned publicly for the right to raise the boy herself and appealed to Brazi- lian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva to intervene, entered separately without commenting.        
	Television images showed a plane taking off from Rios international airport with father and son aboard.

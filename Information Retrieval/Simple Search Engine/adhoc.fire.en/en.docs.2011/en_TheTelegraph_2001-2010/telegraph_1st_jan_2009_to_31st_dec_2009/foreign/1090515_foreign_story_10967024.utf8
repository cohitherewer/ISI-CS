	Sinatra film    
	 Los Angeles, May 14 (Reuters): Oscar-winning director Martin Scorsese will direct the big screen movie about the colourful life of entertainment legend Frank Sinatra, who legions of fans called Ol Blue Eyes, Universal Pictures said yesterday.  
	Casting has yet to be announced for the role of Sinatra, arguably the most popular singer of his era and who also struck box office gold with roles such as his Oscar-winning turn in From Here to Eternity in 1953. The Scorsese movie, Sinatra, is thought to be the first to depict the life of the star in a feature film.

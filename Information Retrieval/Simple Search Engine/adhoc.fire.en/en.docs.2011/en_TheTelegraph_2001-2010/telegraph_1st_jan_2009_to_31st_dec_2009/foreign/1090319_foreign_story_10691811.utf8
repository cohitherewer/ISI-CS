	St Poelten (Austria), March 18 (Reuters): Austrian Josef Fritzl reversed his plea and admitted guilt on all charges today after watching the daughter he locked up and raped for 24 years describe her ordeal in 11 hours of video testimony.        
	Fritzl, 73, who fathered seven children with daughter Elisabeth, admitted enslaving her and murdering one of their babies by neglecting to seek medical treatment.         
	I plead guilty to (all) the charges in the indictment, he told the judge clearly and carefully. This included murder of the infant in the cellar under his small-town home.         
	His turnabout also altered his plea from partial to full guilt on the charge of rape. Fritzl had earlier admitted incest but denied murder and enslavement, the two gravest charges, at the beginning of the trial. Defence lawyer Rudolf Mayer said he was completely surprised by Fritzls plea change.

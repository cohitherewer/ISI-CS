  - Bing is new search engine        MIGUEL HELFT                          A screen shot of the main page of Microsofts new search engine Bing                                        
	New York, May 29: Why dont you Bing it?         
	A year from now, if you hear someone say that  and actually understand what it means  Bill Gates will be a happy billionaire. That is because it will be a sign that Microsoft is finally making progress in its quest to challenge Google in the Internet search business.        
	Bing, the name Microsoft gave to the new search service it unveiled yesterday, is its answer to Google  a noun that once meant little but has become part of the language as a verb that is a synonym for executing a Web search. After months of, uh, searching, Microsoft settled on Bing to replace the all-too-forgettable Live Search, which itself replaced MSN Search.         
	Microsoft invested billions of dollars in those services and failed to slow Googles rise, so a new name certainly cant hurt.        
	Microsofts marketing gurus hope that Bing will evoke neither a type of cherry nor a strip club on The Sopranos TV series but rather a sound  the ringing of a bell that signals the aha moment when a search leads to an answer.        
	The name is meant to conjure the sound of found as Bing helps people with complex tasks like shopping for a camera, said Yusuf Mehdi, senior vice-president of Microsofts online audience business group. And if Bing turns into a verb like, say, Xerox, TiVo or, well, Google, that would be nice too.

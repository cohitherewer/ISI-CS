                                Pierce and Uma: Nick of time                          
	London, May 25 (PTI): Former James Bond star Pierce Brosnan became a life-saver when he rescued co-star Uma Thurman from a speeding mini van during the shooting of their upcoming film, Percy Jackson.         
	The Irish actor, who was on location for the film, spotted the out-of-control vehicle racing down a hill straight towards Thurman, website www.femalefirst.com reported.         
	No one was aboard the runaway as the van barrelled towards a grassy area where Uma was relaxing with cast and crew. Pierce yelled: Get out of the way!, a source said.         
	 He raced after the van, wrenched open the drivers side door, jumped in and slammed on the brakes, the source added. The van hit the pavement and crashed into rubbish bins, sending cast and crew running in all directions to avoid the collision.         
	Everyone scattered out of harms way. Pierce got kudos and hero 007 jokes from Uma. The transportation crew were in trouble for not setting the vans emergency brake, the source said.

	Baghdad, Sept. 12 (AFP): Muntazer al-Zaidi, the Iraqi reporter who shot to fame when he threw his shoes at then US President George W. Bush, is set to be released from jail on Monday, his lawyer said today.        
	I do not think there are any obstacles to his being freed, and I have great hope that he will be released on Monday, Dia al-Saadi said.        
	The defence team has presented a petition for (Zaidis) release to the Iraqi central criminal court, which has handed an order for his release to the prison administration.A little-known reporter for a small, privately owned television channel, Zaidi stunned the world on December 14 when he hurled his shoes at Bush.

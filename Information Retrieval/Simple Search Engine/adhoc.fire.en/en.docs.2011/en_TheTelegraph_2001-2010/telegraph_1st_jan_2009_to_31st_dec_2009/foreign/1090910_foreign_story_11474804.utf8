                              Hasina                            
	Dhaka, Sept. 9 (PTI): The Bangladesh cabinet today approved a draft law to return land confiscated from Hindu families by the former Pakistan regime during the 1965 Indo-Pakistan war.        
	The cabinet approved the Vested Property Return (Amendment) Act 2009 which will be tabled in parliament soon, Prime Minister Sheikh Hasinas press secretary Abul Kalam Azad said.         
	He added that the act restored an identical law enacted during the 1996-2001 tenure of Hasinas Awami League government.        
	The law is meant to replace the legislation that the former Pakistan government had imposed on minorities.         
	Called the Enemy Property Act, it was widely criticised and considered a major violation of minority rights.        
	The Awami League had passed a law to return properties and land back to the minorities during the last leg of its previous government, settinga two-year implementation deadline.         
	However, the subsequent Bangladesh Nationalist Party government ignored the act and eventually it died a natural death.

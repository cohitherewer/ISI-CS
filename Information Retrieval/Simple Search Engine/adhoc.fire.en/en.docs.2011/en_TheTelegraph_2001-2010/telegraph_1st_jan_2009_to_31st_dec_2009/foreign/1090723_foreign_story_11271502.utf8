The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Suicide after secret iPhone loss
                                                                                                               Suicide after secret iPhone loss
                            
	Guangzhou (China), July 22 (AP): An employee at a factory that makes iPhones in China killed himself after a prototype went missing.        
	Apple Inc. responded today by saying its suppliers are required to treat workers with dignity and respect.        
	The dead worker, Sun Danyong, 25, worked in product communications at Foxconn Technology Group, a Taiwanese firm that makes many Apple products at a massive factory in the southern city of Shenzhen, near Hong Kong.        
	Although Apple and Foxconn have confirmed Suns suicide, they have not provided details about the circumstances, which have been reported by the state-run Southern Metropolis Daily.        
	Theres tremendous pressure on employees dealing with Apples new products to maintain a high-level of secrecy over the gadgets, traditionally launched amid great suspense and a big marketing buzz. Apple is also a constant target of prying journalists, and faithful customers.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Obama boosts Afghan forces
                                                                                                               Obama boosts Afghan forces

	Washington, Feb. 18: President Obama has ordered the first combat deployments of his presidency, saying yesterday that he had authorised an additional 17,000 US troops to stabilise a deteriorating situation in Afghanistan.        
	The new deployments, to begin in May, will increase the US force in Afghanistan by nearly 50 per cent, bringing it to 55,000 by mid-summer, along with 32,000 non-US Nato troops. In a statement issued by the White House, Obama said that urgent attention and swift action were required because the Taliban is resurgent in Afghanistan, and al Qaida... threatens America from its safe-haven along the Pakistani border.        
	Taliban attacks and US and Nato casualties last year, including 155 US deaths, reached the highest levels of the seven-year war. War-related civilian Afghan deaths  most blamed on Taliban insurgents but many on US airstrikes  increased nearly 40 per cent to 2,118 in 2008.         
	Extremist groups have expanded their hold on western Pakistan and launched attacks in Pakistani cities.        
	Months ago, the commander of US and Nato forces in Afghanistan, General David D. McKiernan, requested more than 30,000 additional troops this year, and an initial 6,000 arrived last month under orders signed by the Bush administration. But a senior White House official said that no other deployment decisions will be made until the Obama administration completes a strategic review of the Afghan war in late March.        
	Obama has said he wants to limit US objectives in Afghanistan, and administration officials have spoken of a more regional counterinsurgency strategy.

	Dancing dog    
	 London, May 3: A disco-dancing border collie was crowned Britains Most Talented Pet at a pet show in Birmingham after seeing off competition from a showjumping rabbit and a terrier that plays hockey, reports The Sunday Telegraph.       
	The one-year-old dog named Samson proved immune to the stage-fright which affected many of the performers as he danced to Who Let the Dogs Out with his owner, Sarah Brady, 17.      
	The collie weaved in and out Bradys legs and performed twirls, spins and jumps. He drew applause when he stood on his hind legs in a manoeuvre which the judges ruled was a Michael Jackson-style moonwalk.     
	Net loss     
	 London: More than five million days a year are lost to business as a result of workers injuring themselves through surfing the Internet. Repetitive Surf Injury, which is thought to affect more than half a million workers in the UK, is being blamed for a surge in the number of people suffering painful muscle damage as they spend hours hunched over keyboards, balancing laptops on their knees or continually texting on mobile phones and Blackberrys.

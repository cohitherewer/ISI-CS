	Cruz voice    
	Los Angeles, Nov. 8 (PTI): Actress Penelope Cruz locked herself up in a hotel room as she prepared for her role in Rob Marshalls highly anticipated musical Nine.      
	Cruz said she was paranoid about protecting her voice before recording at Londons Abbey Road Studios and decided to speak to no one, reports Entertainment Weekly. I thought it would be more responsible and professional if I didnt talk to anybody before I had to record. So I was laying on my bed like Dracula, looking at the ceiling and waiting to go to the studio.      
	I got so tense from trying to protect myself too much... The second day I was much more relaxed, said Cruz who won the best supporting Oscar for her role in Vicky Christina Barcelona. Directed by Rob Marshall, the film is loosely based on Federico Fellinis autobiographical 1963 film 81/2.     
	Nude Eva    
	London (PTI): Bond girl Eva Green, who had earlier confessed being insecure about her body, has finally overcome her shyness to pose for her first naked photoshoot. The 29-year-old French actress has shed her inhibitions as well as her clothes for the latest edition of Tatler. She recreats a classic Seventies portrait of British actress Charlotte Rampling, reports the Daily Mail.     
	Moss home    
	London (PTI): Former Spice girl Victoria Beckham has been house hunting for Kate Moss in Beverly Hills as the supermodel wants a permanent base in Los Angeles. Moss has asked her new friend Victoria, who lives in Los Angeles with husband David Beckham and their sons Brooklyn, 10, Romeo, seven, and Cruz, four, to help look for a new property, reports the Daily Star.     
	Fox temper    
	London (PTI): Actress Megan Fox, who plays a demonic cheerleader in Jennifers Body, found it easy to get into the character because of her angry nature. I think everybody is angry about something and I just happen to be really angry and go for it, Fox said.

	Mariah disguise    
	 London, Oct. 8 (PTI): Pop diva Mariah Carey has revealed that she goes out dressed in her husband Nick Cannons clothes so that she is not recognised in public.      
	Carey, 40, who is married to 28-year-old rapper-and-actor Cannon, likes to see if she can trick people by wearing his clothes.      
	I go for walks in a semi-disguise. Thats fun to me. I like to go to public places and do things that I would never get a chance to do. The other night, I went out wearing Nicks clothes, Carey said.      
	The problem is, if they recognise him, theyre going to recognise me., she added.

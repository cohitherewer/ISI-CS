The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Michelle, Queen break down Buckingham barriers
                                                                                                               Michelle, Queen break down Buckingham barriers
          AMIT ROY                              
	London, April 2: Manmohan Singh and his wife, Gursharan, were among G20 guests at last nights Buckingham Palace reception who were taken aback by the liberties taken by Americas First Lady with Her Majestys person.        
	 Towering over the British monarch, Michelle Obama was so carried away by the occasion that she slipped an arm around Queen in total breach of accepted protocol.        
	 What was astonishing was that the Queen did not appear to object and reacted, not with a brush off as she once did with an over-friendly Aussie politician who tried to pat her bottom, but by putting an arm around Michelles generous waist.        
	 One of the cardinal rules of meeting the Queen is that any kind of physical familiarity is totally taboo. Those near the couple felt it was possibly the Queen who initiated the gesture of intimacy whereupon Michelle, being warm and American, responded by returning the gesture.        
	It was all the more surprising because when the Obamas first walked into the Royal presence, she first curtsied  just as Shilpa Shetty had done when the Bollywood actress was granted an audience by the Queen two years ago.        
	 Last nights incident at Buckingham Palace became the major talking point of the day, virtually overshadowing almost everything  even the pitched battles between police and some rioters during which one man died  that happened yesterday on the eve of todays summit.        
	 It was just as well that the Indian Prime Minister took it easy in the early part of the day for, after talks lasting over an hour with Gordon Brown, he and his wife, Gursharan, were swept by limousine and police escort to the Queens party in the picture gallery at Buckingham Palace.        
	 The Queen, who was in a jolly mood, sat for a group photograph in the palaces ornate Throne Room with the G20 leaders and made everyone laugh with her little quip: It has to be a happy photo.        
	 There Singh met Obama with whom he will have whats called a bilateral today. Then it was to 10, Downing Street, for Browns dinner where the Indian Prime Minister was wedged between Silvio Berlusconi, the Prime Minister of Italy, and President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner of Argentina.        
	 Singh was seen fiddling with a piece of paper which turned out to be a thank you speech. The leaders each went home with a goodie bag of specially-selected treats from around the UK. Its contents reinforced how the recession has bitten deeply into even the UK governments gift department.        
	 The mini-hampers contained a tie by one of three British designers  Timothy Everest, Ozwald Boateng or Richard James; a pewter bowl and candle designed by Kelly Hoppen; some Rococo chocolates; some Thomas Ferguson Irish linen; Welsh heather honey biscuits from Fortnum amp; Mason; and wraps made by Harris Tweed Hebrides.         
	 While the men had a stilted working dinner, the spouses had the same food cooked by Jamie Oliver, a young English celebrity chef, next door at number 11, Downing Street, hosted by Sarah Brown, the British Prime Ministers wife.        
	 Oliver did not stand on ceremony but fetched and carried his own food. Guests included Harry Potter author J K Rowling, who sat next to Michelle and probably offered the First Lady signed copies of her novels to take back to the White House for the children.        
	 Gursharan was given a seat at a table with another guest, film Bend It Like Beckham director Gurinder Chadha, possibly because whoever did the seating plan felt the Indian Prime Ministers wife might feel more comfortable seated next to a fellow Sikh who spoke her native tongue.        
	 The third Indian woman present was also a Sikh. She was Jasvinder Sanghera, who would have briefed all and sundry on the shortcomings of Indian men  she runs an organisation, Karma Nirvana, that tries to help women who have tried to escape forced marriages.

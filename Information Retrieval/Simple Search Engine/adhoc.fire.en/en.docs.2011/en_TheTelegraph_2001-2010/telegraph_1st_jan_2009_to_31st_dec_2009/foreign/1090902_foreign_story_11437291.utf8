	New York, Sept. 1: A wire-haired dachshund that held the record as the worlds oldest dog and celebrated its last birthday with a party at a dog hotel and spa has died at age 21  or 147 in dog years.        
	The dog, named Chanel, died on Friday of natural causes at her owners home in suburban Port Jefferson Station, on Long Island.        
	Chanel, as stylish as her legendary namesake, wore tinted goggles for her cataracts in her later years and favoured sweaters because she was sensitive to the cold, owners Denice and Karl Shaughnessy said yesterday.        
	The playful dachshund was only 6 weeks old when Denice Shaughnessy, adopted her from a shelter in Newport News, Virginia. Along with her owner, Chanel spent nine years on assignment in Germany.

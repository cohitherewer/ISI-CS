	Padang (Indonesia), Oct. 1 (Reuters): Rescue teams struggled today to reach scores of people trapped under debris and survivors pleaded for aid after a powerful quake hit the Indonesian city of Padang, possibly killing thousands.        
	The 7.6 magnitude quake struck the bustling port city of 900,000 people yesterday, toppling hundreds of buildings. Telephone connections were patchy, making it hard for officials to work out the extent of destruction and loss of life.        
	I have been through quakes here before and this was the worst. There is blood everywhere, people with their limbs cut off. We saw buildings collapsed, people dying, said American Greg Hunt, 38, who was at Padang airport.        
	A Reuters reporter in the city said rescuers were pulling people from buildings, but there was little sign of much aid being distributed yet. Fuel was also in short supply and there was a report of looting.        
	Health minister Siti Fadillah Supari told reporters at an airport in Jakarta before leaving for Padang that the number of dead could be numbered in the thousands, given the widespread damage. A worker compiling disaster data at the social ministry put the number killed of confirmed deaths at 531.         
	An Indonesian government official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, told the Associated Press that the death toll had risen to 777. He said most of the dead were from Padang.         
	President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono, who arrived back from the G20 meeting today, told reporters the country could coordinate the relief efforts but welcomed help from abroad.        
	Australia, South Korea and Japan were among nations offering aid or help. Two Indonesian Hercules transport planes carrying medical aid, as well as 20,000 tents and 10,000 blankets, also flew to Padang today. A 6.6 magnitude quake hit another part of Sumatra island today, causing fresh panic.

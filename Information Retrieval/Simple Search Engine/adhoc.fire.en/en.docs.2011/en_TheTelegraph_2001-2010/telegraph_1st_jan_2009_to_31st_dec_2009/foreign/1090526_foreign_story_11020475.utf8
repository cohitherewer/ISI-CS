	Mardan (Pakistan), May 25: Bacha Zab, a 32-year-old fruit salesman, dodged army shelling and Taliban sniper fire to escape Swat Valley.         
	But when he reached the safety of a government-run refugee camp in this northwestern Pakistani city, he was told there was no more room.         
	Instead, for the past 16 days, Zab, his wife and their four children have been in the care of a private Islamic charity with close ties to a banned militant organisation. We are asking for help from the government, but they wont give it, Zab said. In the government camps, there are only problems.         
	The government has been overwhelmed by the human tide that has washed over the northwest as about 2 million people have fled fierce clashes in Swat. With Pakistan experiencing its largest exodus since the nations partition from India in 1947, only a fraction of the displaced civilians are receiving assistance in government-run camps.         
	The rest are fending for themselves or getting help from private charities, including some that are allied with the very forces the Pakistani army is fighting in Swat.         
	Refugee camps in Pakistan have been prime recruiting grounds for militant groups ever since the Soviet invasion forced millions of Afghans to cross into Pakistan in the 1980s. Now, concern is growing that this latest wave of displacement will create a fresh crop of Pakistanis with grievances against the government and loyalty to groups that seek to undermine the state through violent insurgency.         
	The government says it is aware of the peril, but it appears incapable of mustering the resources it needs to provide shelter, food, water and medicine to so many people.         
	If people are not looked after well, they tend to become extremists. It hasnt happened yet, but were very conscious of it, said Farhatullah Babar, a spokesman for President Asif Ali Zardari.

          WILLIAM GRIMES                          Frank McCourt                                  
	New York, July 20: Frank McCourt, a former New York city schoolteacher who turned his miserable childhood in Limerick, Ireland, into a phenomenally popular, Pulitzer Prize-winning memoir, Angelas Ashes, died in Manhattan yesterday. He was 78 and lived in Manhattan and Roxbury, Connecticut.        
	The cause was metastatic melanoma, said McCourts brother, the writer Malachy.         
	McCourt, who taught in the citys school system for nearly 30 years, had always told his writing students that they were their own best material. In his mid-60s, he decided to take his own advice, sitting down to commit his childhood memories to paper and producing what he described as a modest book, modestly written.         
	In it McCourt described a childhood of terrible deprivation. After his alcoholic father abandoned the family, his mother  the Angela of the title  begged on the streets of Limerick to keep him and his three brothers meagerly fed, poorly clothed and housed in a basement flat with no bathroom and a thriving population of vermin. The books clear-eyed look at childhood misery, its incongruously lilting, buoyant prose and its heart-felt urgency struck a remarkable chord with readers and critics.         
	Angelas Ashes, published by Scribner in 1996, rose to the top of the bestseller lists and stayed there for more than two years, selling four million copies in hardback. The next year, it won the Pulitzer Prize for biography and the National Book Critics Circle Award.         
	Two more installments of his life story followed: Tis (1999), which described his struggle to gain a foothold in New York, and Teacher Man (2005), an account of his misadventures and small victories as a public-school teacher.

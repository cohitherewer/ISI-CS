	Los Angeles, April 19 (PTI): Madonna has suffered injuries and bruises after being thrown off a horse while riding, People magazine reported.         
	The accident took place yesterday at New Yorks posh suburb of Southampton when a paparazzo hiding in the bushes, jumped out to click a picture of the pop star but startled the horse, which threw her down and ran off.        
	The 50-year-old was taken to hospital, where she was treated for minor injuries and released, Madonnas publicist Liz Rosenbergs said.        
	Rosenberg added that further medical tests were to be conducted and doctors would continue to observe Madonna.

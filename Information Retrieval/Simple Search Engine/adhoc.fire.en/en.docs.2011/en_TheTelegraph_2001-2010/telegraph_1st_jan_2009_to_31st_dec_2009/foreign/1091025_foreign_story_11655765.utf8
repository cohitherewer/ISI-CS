The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Balloon mum admits hoax
                                                                                                   Balloon mum admits hoax
										                        Mayumi Heene				                           
	Denver, Oct. 24 (AP): The mother of the 6-year-old boy once feared missing inside a runaway helium balloon admitted the whole saga was a hoax, according to court documents.        
	 Mayumi Heene told sheriffs deputies that she and her husband Richard knew all along that Falcon was hiding in the residence in Fort Collins, according to an affidavit, released yesterday, that was used to get a search warrant for the home.        
	She allegedly told investigators the incident was a hoax meant to make the family more marketable to the media. Mayumi described that she and Richard Heene devised this hoax approximately two weeks earlier. ... She and Richard had instructed their three children to lie to authorities as well as the media regarding this hoax, the affidavit said.        
	Richard Heene has denied a hoax. His lawyer, David Lane, said yesterday he is waiting to see the evidence in the case.        
	Allegations are cheap, Lane said. Mayumi Heenes lawyer, Lee Christian, was travelling and didnt immediately respond to messages left with his office.        
	Larimer County Sheriff Jim Alderden has said he will recommend charges against the Heenes including conspiracy, contributing to the delinquency of a minor, making a false report to authorities, and attempting to influence a public servant. The most serious charges are felonies and carry a maximum sentence of six years in prison.        
	Alderden said authorities also would be seeking restitution for the costs of the balloon chase.

                                                                                                               Carreras to retire from opera
                              Carreras                            
	London, May 8: Jos Carreras, who became a household name as one of the Three Tenors with Luciano Pavarotti and Plcido Domingo, announced his retirement from opera in an interview with The Times today.         
	The Spanish singer, 62, a survivor of leukaemia, declared that he can no longer withstand the rigours of performing principal roles, unamplified, to opera houses. If I can do concert recitals, adapting the repertoire to my needs, then no problem, thats good enough, he said.         
	Carrerass exit from the opera scene leaves only Domingo, performing operatic roles. Pavarotti died in 2007, at 71, after a long struggle with pancreatic cancer.                     THE TIMES, LONDON

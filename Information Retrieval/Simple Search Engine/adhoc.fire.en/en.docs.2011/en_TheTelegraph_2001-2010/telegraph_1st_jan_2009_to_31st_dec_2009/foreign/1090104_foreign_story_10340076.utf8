The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | TN parties blame Centre for Lanka inaction
                                                                                                               TN parties blame Centre for Lanka inaction

	Chennai, Jan. 3: Pro-Tiger parties in Tamil Nadu today took out their anger on the Centre for the fall of Kilinochchi, even though India could not have intervened at a time it is waging its own war on terrorism.        
	Most regional parties, barring Jayalalithaas ADMK, which is not known to be sympathetic to the LTTE, slammed the Centre for failing to send foreign minister Pranab Mukherjee to Colombo to help broker a ceasefire.        
	This only shows New Delhis mindless and callous attitude just because at the receiving end of this genocidal frenzy are the hapless and voiceless Tamils. I would like to remind you that those who are being killed are not only our Tamil brethren but also Indians living in an alien soil, PMK founder S. Ramadoss said in a letter to Prime Minister Manmohan Singh.         
	However, none fielded questions on how India could justify a ceasefire, which would have helped the Tigers regroup, when it is targeting Pakistans inaction on tackling terror.        
	The parties seemed to be attacking the Centre to deflect criticism from their local constituencies, some of which consider the LTTEs campaign a freedom struggle and V. Prabhakaran a cult figure.         
	Ramadoss urged Delhi to step in at least at this stage and put an end to the military solution being pursued by the Lankan government and instead push for a negotiated political resolution.        
	 Although the ruling DMK has not reacted officially, its Rajya Sabha MP Kanimozhi, who is Tamil Nadu chief minister M. Karunanidhis daughter, said she shed tears after learning about the fall of Kilinochchi.         
	Cong demand        
	The Congress today asked Sri Lanka to hand over LTTE chief Prabhakaran if he is caught so that he faces trial for the assassination of former Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi.         
	We will be happy if Prabhakaran is caught and handed over to India for the heinous crime he has committed. He should be brought to book for the assassination of our beloved leader Rajiv Gandhi, Congress chief spokesperson M. Veerappa Moily said.

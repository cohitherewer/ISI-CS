The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Even in slump, Europe Socialists suffer
                                                                                                               Even in slump, Europe Socialists suffer
          STEVEN ERLANGER                          Chancellor Merkel, whose party the Christian Democrats defeated the Social Democrats in the German elections, at a news conference in Berlin. (AP)                                  
	Paris, Sept. 29: A spectre is haunting Europe  the spectre of Socialisms slow collapse.        
	Even in the midst of one of the greatest challenges to capitalism in 75 years, involving a breakdown of the financial system due to irrational exuberance, greed and the weakness of regulatory systems, European Socialist parties and their Left-wing cousins have not taken advantage of the Rights failures.        
	German voters clobbered the Social Democratic Party on Sunday, giving it only 23 per cent of the vote, its worst performance since World War II.        
	Voters also punished Left-leaning candidates in the summers European Parliament elections and trounced French Socialists in 2007. Where the Left holds power, as in Spain and Britain, it is under attack. Where it is out, as in France, Italy and now Germany, it is divided and listless.        
	Some American conservatives demonise President Obamas fiscal stimulus and health care overhaul as a dangerous turn towards European-style Socialism  but it is Europes Right, not Left, that is setting its political agenda.        
	Europes Centre-Right parties have embraced many ideas of the Left: generous welfare benefits, nationalised health care, sharp restrictions on carbon emissions, the ceding of some sovereignty to the EU.         
	But they have won votes by promising to deliver more efficiently than the Left, while working to lower taxes, improve financial regulation, and grapple with ageing populations. Europes conservatives, says Michel Winock, a historian at the Paris Institut dtudes Politiques, have adapted themselves to modernity.         
	When Nicolas Sarkozy of France and Germanys Angela Merkel condemn the excesses of the Anglo-Saxon model of capitalism while praising the protective power of the state, they are using Socialist ideas that have become mainstream, he said.        
	It is not that the Left is irrelevant  it often represents the only viable opposition to established governments, and so benefits, as in the US, from the normal cycle of electoral politics.        
	In Portugal, the governing Socialists won re-election on Sunday, but lost an absolute parliamentary majority. In Spain, the Socialists still get credit for opposing both Franco and the Iraq war. In Germany, the broad Left, including the Greens, has a structural majority in parliament.         
	However, the Social Democrats, in post-election crisis, must contemplate allying with the hard Left, Die Linke, which has roots in the old East German Communist Party.        
	Part of the problem is the wall in the head between East and West Germans. While the Christian Democrats moved smoothly eastwards, the Social Democrats of the West never joined with the Communists. The two Germanys, one Socialist, one Communist  two souls  never really merged, said Giovanni Sartori, a professor emeritus at Columbia University.

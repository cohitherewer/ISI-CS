The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Prabhakaran certificate
                                                                                                               Prabhakaran certificate
                            
	Colombo, May 21 (PTI): Sri Lanka has promised to give India Tiger chief Velupillai Prabhakarans death certificate to close the Rajiv Gandhi assassination case, national security adviser M.K. Narayanan said today.        
	He added that India was going by public statements from the Sri Lankan government that Prabhakaran, 54, had been killed in combat in the islands northeast earlier in the week and had no reason to doubt Colombos announcement. Narayanan told reporters here after talks with President Mahinda Rajapaksa that the Lankan government has made a public announcement on Prabhakarans death.        
	We will go by that. We will of course wait for a death certificate from the government so that the Rajiv assassination case can be sort of closed, said Narayanan. Beyond that, it is not possible for us to do anything.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Kalpana had seconds to respond before crash
                                                                                                               Kalpana had seconds to respond before crash
                              Chawla: Tragic end                            
	Dec. 31: India-born Kalpana Chawla and six other astronauts slipped into unconsciousness within seconds and their bodies were whipped around in seats whose restraints failed as the space shuttle Columbia spun out of control and disintegrated in 2003, according to a new report from Nasa.         
	The 400-page report said the Columbia crews first warning of trouble was a cabin alarm that signalled a problem with the shuttles control jets. The astronauts had just 41 seconds of consciousness to respond. Analysis of the wreckage indicated the crew had flipped cockpit switches in response to alarms that were sounding. The astronauts had also reset the shuttles autopilot system, the report said.        
	We have evidence from some of the switch positions that the crew was trying very hard to regain control. Were talking about a very brief time in a crisis situation, said Nasas deputy associate administrator, Wayne Hale.        
	From the crews perspective, the shift from what appeared to be a normal descent on February 1, 2003, into disaster happened so fast that they didnt even have time to close the visors on their helmets.         
	Columbia broke apart about 20km over Texas as it headed for landing at the Kennedy Space Centre.        
	Although the shuttle broke up during re-entry, its fate had been all but sealed during ascent, when a 1.67-pound piece of insulating foam broke away from an external fuel tank and struck the left wing, punching a hole. The impact of the foam was obvious in videos taken at launching, and during the 16-day mission, Nasa engineers pleaded with mission managers to examine the wing for serious damage.         
	As the shuttle made a landing approach, the hole allowed superheated gases to cut through the wings interior like a blowtorch, melting the ships structure. The spacecraft was just west of California.         
	A few seconds later, Columbias course wavered, and the astronauts lost communication with Mission Control.        
	 Analysis shows the astronauts shoulder harnesses failed. The violence inside the fractured ship tore the crew from their seat belts and slammed their heads around in their helmets. Lethal trauma occurred to the unconscious or deceased crew due to the lack of upper-body support and restraint, the report said.                    WRITTEN WITH AGENCY REPORTS

	Baden Baden (Germany), April 3 (Reuters): President Barack Obama said today he did not expect Nato troops to have to enter Pakistan, but said allies should do more to help Islamabad root out safe havens for Islamist militants.        
	Obama last month unveiled a new strategy for the conflict in Afghanistan, with a new emphasis on neighbouring Pakistan which has been targeted by militants.        
	But Obama told a news conference following talks with German Chancellor Angela Merkel before a Nato summit: My focus on Pakistan does not envision Nato troop activities in Pakistan.        
	It does mean that the US and Nato partners have to work more effectively with Pakistan to enable them to root out the safe havens for extremists that pose not just a danger to us but now pose an extraordinary danger to Pakistan. A patchwork of militant factions is based in northwest Pakistans ethnic Pashtun border lands.        
	Obama said more international efforts should be made to help Pakistan with training for a different type of conflict to the kind it has traditionally faced.        
	Those are all areas where I think Nato can work together very effectively and we cant ultimately, I believe, be effective in Afghanistan if we have not addressed the problems across the border, Obama said.         
	The US has 38,000 troops in Afghanistan, more than all the other national contingents put together. Obama has said he will add an extra 17,000 combat troops as well as 4,000 others to help train Afghan officials. European leaders are reluctant to send more of their own soldiers to a war that is unpopular with voters, preferring to focus their energies on reconstruction and development.        
	Unlike his predecessor George W. Bush, who was deeply unpopular in Europe and whose administration sometimes bullied allies publicly to bolster their contributions in Afghanistan, Obama struck a more conciliatory tone.        
	I understand that after a long campaign in Afghanistan people can feel weary of war, even a war that is just, he told reporters at a joint news conference with Merkel. But he also delivered a clear message, saying he expected Germany would be stepping up to the plate and warning of the al Qaida threat to Europe.        
	Obamas Afghan plan aims to get a grip on rising violence by Taliban militants driven from power in 2001 but never completely defeated, broadening the focus to Pakistan and putting the highest priority on the defeat of al Qaida militants.        
	Sarkozy endorsed the strategy after talks with Obama, but made clear France would not increase its 2,780 troop contingent. Instead, it would help with policing and training, he said.        
	Obama was greeted by cheering crowds when he arrived in the Strasbourg in eastern France, fresh from his economic diplomacy at the G20 summit in Britain, and was also feted later when he travelled the short distance across the border to Germany.

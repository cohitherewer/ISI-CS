The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Obamas Afghan benchmark   Pak told: Goal to defeat Qaida
                                                                                                               Obamas Afghan benchmark     Pak told: Goal to defeat Qaida
          PETER BAKER AND THOM SHANKER                        Obama in Washington. (AFP)                                        
	Washington, March 27: President Obama said today that he plans to further bolster American forces in Afghanistan and for the first time set benchmarks for progress in fighting al Qaida and the Taliban there and in Pakistan.        
	In imposing conditions on the Afghans and Pakistanis, Obama is replicating a strategy used in Iraq two years ago both to justify a deeper American commitment and prod governments in the region to take more responsibility for quelling the insurgency and building lasting political institutions.         
	The situation is increasingly perilous, Obama told government officials, top military officers and diplomats in remarks at the White House, warning that al Qaida and its allies are entrenched in Afghanistan and Pakistan, that they control parts of both countries, and that they are actively planning further attacks on the US and its interests and allies.        
	His goal, he said, is to disrupt, dismantle and defeat them in both countries. That requires a strategy that is both stronger and smarter, he said, and a commitment to Afghanistan that is not hobbled by the continuing costs of the war in Iraq.        
	The new strategy, officials said, will send 4,000 more troops to train Afghan security forces on top of the 17,000 extra combat troops that he already ordered to Afghanistan shortly after taking office.         
	Although the administration is still developing the specific benchmarks for Afghanistan and Pakistan, officials said they would be the most explicit demands ever presented to the governments in Kabul and Islamabad. In effect, Obama would be insisting that two fractured countries plagued by ancient tribal rivalries and modern geopolitical hostility find ways to work together and transform their societies.        
	American officials have repeatedly said that Afghanistan has to make more progress in fighting corruption, curbing the drug trade and sharing power with the regions, while they have insisted that Pakistan do more to cut ties between parts of its government and the Taliban.         
	Obama telephoned President Hamid Karzai of Afghanistan and President Asif Ali Zardari of Pakistan yesterday to share the main elements of the strategic review.        
	Setting benchmarks for Pakistan could be particularly difficult. For years, the US has simply paid bills submitted by the Pakistani government for counterterrorism operations, even during truces when its military was not involved in counterterrorism. Pakistan has resisted linking its aid to specific performance criteria and officials acknowledged that developing those criteria could be problematic.        
	The key elements of Obamas plan, with its more robust combat force, its emphasis on training, and its far-reaching goals, foreshadow an ambitious but risky and costly attempt to unify and stabilise Afghanistan and Pakistan.         
	Obama is unveiling his approach at a time when the conflict is worsening, the lives of the people are not visibly improving, and the intervention by American-led foreign powers is increasingly resented.

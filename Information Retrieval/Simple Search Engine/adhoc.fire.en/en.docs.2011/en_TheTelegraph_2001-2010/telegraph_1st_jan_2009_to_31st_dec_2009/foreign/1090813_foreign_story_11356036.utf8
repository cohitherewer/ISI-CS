The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | China arrests 4 from Rio Tinto
                                                                                                               China arrests 4 from Rio Tinto
  - Mining giant accused of bribery, Beijing tones down charges        DAVID BARBOZA                          The Rio Tinto office in Shanghai. (AP)                                        
	Shanghai, Aug. 12: China formally arrested an Australian citizen and three other Chinese employees of the British-Australian mining giant Rio Tinto early today on suspicion of commercial bribery and trade secrets infringement, ending a diplomatic standoff over whether employees of a foreign company had spied on China.        
	Prosecutors announced the decision six weeks after the four employees had been detained in Shanghai on allegations that they had violated Chinas state secrets law by getting access to confidential documents that gave them an advantage in negotiating iron ore prices with Chinese steel mills. In deciding not to pursue state secret charges, Beijing appeared to bow to international pressure after Australian officials complained about a lack of transparency in the case and global investors worried that there could be new risks in doing business in China.        
	But analysts say the announcement does little to resolve broader questions about how the case unfolded, who is involved or whether politics was a factor in a case that emerged shortly after China and Rio Tinto broke off iron ore negotiations over a price dispute.        
	Theres still a lot we dont know, said Jack Huang, a lawyer at Jones Day, the international law firm.        
	What prosecutors said was that the four Rio Tinto employees used improper means to gain access to information about Chinas state-controlled steel industry and that they engaged in commercial bribery.        
	Very few other details, such as how much bribery was alleged to be involved, how it was said to work or whether Rio Tinto would face sanctions, were disclosed.        
	A spokesman for the Shanghai bureau of the prosecutors office said today that the investigation was continuing and that the four employees had not yet been indicted.        
	Australian officials added more detail today, saying Chinese officials had informed them that the Rio employees had given bribes but also taken bribes from individuals not employed by state organisations. Rio Tinto, one of the worlds biggest mining companies and one of Chinas biggest iron ore suppliers, has strongly denied any wrongdoing in the case.         
	In a statement released today, the companys chief executive, Sam Walsh, said: Rio Tinto will strongly support its employees in defending these allegations. From all the information available to us, we continue to believe that our employees have acted properly and ethically in their business dealings in China.        
	But legal experts say bribery is widespread in China. In the first half of this year alone, Beijing says 9,000 officials were found guilty of graft, and about 24,000 officials were investigated.

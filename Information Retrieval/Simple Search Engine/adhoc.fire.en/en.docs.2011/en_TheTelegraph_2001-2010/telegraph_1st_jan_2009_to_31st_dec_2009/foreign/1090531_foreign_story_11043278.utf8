	Islamabad, May 30: Pakistans army today said that it had taken full control of Mingora, the most populous city in the Swat Valley, scoring a significant victory against Taliban forces three weeks after the start of an offensive in the area.         
	Major General Athar Abbas, a military spokesman, said at a news conference that the army was able to flush out militants, in part with the help of locals who showed soldiers Taliban hiding places in hotels and other buildings. The military estimates it has killed more than 1,000 militants since the campaign began on May 8.         
	Mingora, 161km northwest of Islamabad is the most important city in Swat, a resort area that was overrun by the Taliban. The campaign is seen as a test of Pakistans resolve to fight its growing insurgency, which has spread substantially in the past two years, and which the US says is compromising efforts to quell a similar insurgency in Afghanistan.         
	General Abbas announced the killing of two militant commanders, Abu Syed and Misbahuddin, but said it was unclear whether any more senior leaders had been killed or captured. We are refraining from announcing or declaring until we have something in hand  some proof, some smoking gun, General Abbas said.         
	Pakistans military has conducted two previous operations in Swat, but each involved fewer ground troops than this offensive, and they were criticized as causing too much harm to civilians without discernible gains against the Taliban.        
	Now, General Abbas said, the Pakistani public seems to be firmly behind the expanded offensive. The military feels its in a much better position to finish the job because it has public support, he said.        
	Soldiers deaths have been commemorated in emotional public ceremonies, and news channels have been praising troops with segments with headlines like All the Right Moves.

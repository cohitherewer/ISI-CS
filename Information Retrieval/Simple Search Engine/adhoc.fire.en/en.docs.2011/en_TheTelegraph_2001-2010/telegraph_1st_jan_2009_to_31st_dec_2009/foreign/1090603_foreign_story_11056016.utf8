	Brasilia, Brazil, June 2 (Agencies): Brazilian military pilots spotted an airplane seat, a life jacket, metallic debris and signs of fuel in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean today as they hunted for a missing Air France passenger jet that carried 228 people.        
	Brazils navy said three commercial ships in the area were joining the search.        
	The pilots spotted two areas of floating debris  but no signs of life  about 60km apart, about 650km beyond the Brazilian island of Fernando de Noronha, roughly along Flight 447s path from Rio de Janeiro to Paris, said air force spokesperson Jorge Amaral.        
	The locations where the objects were found are towards the right of the point where the last signal of the plane was emitted, Amaral said. That suggests that it might have tried to make a turn, maybe to return to Fernando de Noronha, but that is just a hypothesis.        
	Amaral said authorities would not be able to confirm that the debris is from the plane until they can retrieve some of it from the ocean for identification.        
	 The discovery came more than 24 hours after the jet went missing, with all feared dead.        
	Rescuers were still scanning a vast sweep of ocean extending from far off northeastern Brazil to waters off West Africa.        
	Investigators on both sides of the ocean are trying to determine what brought the Airbus A330 down, with few clues to go on so far.        
	Potential causes could include violently shifting winds and hail from towering thunderheads, lightning or some combination of other factors.        
	 The crew gave no verbal messages of distress before the crash, but the planes system sent an automatic message just before it disappeared, reporting lost pressure and electrical failure. The planes cockpit and black box recorders could be thousands of feet below the surface.        
	The chance of finding survivors now is very very small, even non-existent, said the French minister overseeing transportation, Jean-Louis Borloo. The race against the clock has begun to find the planes two black boxes, which emit signals up to 30 days.        
	Borloo called the A330 one of the most reliable planes in the world and said lightning alone, even from a fierce tropical storm, probably couldnt have brought down the plane. There really had to be a succession of extraordinary events to be able to explain this situation, Borloo said.        
	On board the flight were 61 French citizens, 58 Brazilians, 26 Germans and nine Chinese.         
	Among them were three Irish doctors, returning from vacation in Brazil. Aisling Butlers father John paid tribute to his 26-year-old daughter, from Roscrea, County Tipperary. She was a truly wonderful, exciting girl. She never flunked an exam in her life... and took it all in her stride, he said.

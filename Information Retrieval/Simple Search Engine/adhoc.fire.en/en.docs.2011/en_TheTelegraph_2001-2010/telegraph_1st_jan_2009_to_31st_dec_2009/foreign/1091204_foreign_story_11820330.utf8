	London, Dec. 3 (PTI): Actress Jessica Alba, often voted as one of the sexiest women in the world, is so wary of her daughter Honors figure that she has refused to give the toddler any sugary drinks.        
	The 28-year-old actress, who gave birth to Honor in June last year, has banned sodas and juices insisting that she wants to make sure her daughter has a healthy outlook in life, reports www.Contactmusic.com.        
	She doesnt have sugar at all; she doesnt even have fruit juice. She has, like, three-quarters celery or cucumber juice with a little bit of apple juice  thats the most sugar shes ever had.         
	I know its crazy but... she doesnt know. Shes like, Cucumber juice  awesome!, Alba said.

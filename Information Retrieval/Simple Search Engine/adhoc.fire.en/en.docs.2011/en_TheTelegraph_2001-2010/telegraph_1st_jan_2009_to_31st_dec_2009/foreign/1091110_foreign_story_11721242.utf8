	London, Nov. 9: Cambridge University has become embroiled in a row after proposing to sell the right to rename its library to the highest bidder.         
	University dons said they were concerned that a commercial tie-up would demean the prominence and reputation of the library.         
	Prof. Gill Evans, a member of the universitys Regent House governing body, said: At this rate, one might set off for the University Library one morning to find it turned into a branch of Tesco with an Internet caf.        
	University bosses have decided on the move to boost fundraising and said it was a completely ordinary measure to investigate all funding streams.        
	But Prof. Evans, emeritus professor of medieval theology and intellectual history, said she was angry that staff had not been consulted. She said: What is there to stop someone literally buying the library? The problem is that there could be a trade-off between the scale of the benefaction and restrictions on use for members of the university.         
	People get very angry about name changes  its the kind of thing that really gets peoples goat. What if the library was to be sponsored by Bill Gates, or a firm of the calibre of Enron, or indeed Tesco? It could happen.         
	What sort of message would be sent out if it was called Cambridge Tesco University Library? I understand there has been no consultation with library staff on any level. They could see their wages paid for by the benefaction, rather than through the universitys pay structure. The university said the move was the ultimate commemorative naming opportunity and said the benefaction would mark the 800th anniversary of its founding.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Nepal oath row puts focus on minorities
                                                                                                               Nepal oath row puts focus on minorities
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                           Vice-President Parmanand Jha in Kathmandu. (AFP)                                  
	New Delhi, Aug. 31: Culture more than politics is at the centre of the extraordinary constitutional impasse created by the Nepali Vice-President Parmanand Jha.         
	In refusing to take oath of office in Nepali, the official language, he is drawing attention to the long-standing and long-ignored demand of the countrys linguistic minorities to be taken on board.         
	Jha dared the Supreme Court yesterday, indignantly rebuffing a directive that he take an oath in Nepali.         
	Jhas intransigence has created an unprecedented deadlock at the top of the ruling hierarchy: constitutional experts in Nepal believe that following the lapse of the Supreme Court deadline, Jhas appointment as the countrys first Vice-President stands nullified.        
	Jhas lawyers have resorted to charming legalese  their client, they contend, is an elected Vice-President who is yet to be sworn in.         
	Prime Minister Madhav Kumar Nepal, already mired in a series of domestic crises, didnt need Jha, a nominee of the terai-based Madhesi Janadhikar Forum, to add to his troubled plate. However, this crisis is about much more than Jhas future as Vice-President of Nepal.        
	 It is about the cultural rights of terai-based groups that have struggled in vain for nearly half a century for greater inclusion in the hill-dominated Nepali establishment, for greater functional autonomy, even secession.         
	Just for the record, there are more than a hundred Madhesi rights groups  some of them armed and underground  that have sought to either neutralise or break away from what they call pahadi dominance.         
	A key part of that struggle has been to get their many languages  Bhojpuri, Magahi, Maithili and Hindi, which functions as a link  formal recognition.         
	Madhesis constitute nearly half of Nepals population, yet none of their languages is even a medium of instruction in schools or colleges in the Madhes region.

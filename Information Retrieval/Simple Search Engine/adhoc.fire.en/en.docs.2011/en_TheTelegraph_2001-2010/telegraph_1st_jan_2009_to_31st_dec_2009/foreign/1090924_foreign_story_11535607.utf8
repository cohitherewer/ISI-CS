          HELENE COOPER                          Obama speaking in the General Assembly at the UN on Wednesday. (AFP)                                  
	United Nations, Sept. 23: The US is ready to begin a new era of engagement with the world, President Obama said today in a sweeping address to the UN General Assembly in which he sought to clearly delineate differences between his administration and that of former President George W. Bush.        
	We have re-engaged the United Nations, Obama said, to cheers from world leaders and delegates in the cavernous hall of the General Assembly. We have paid our bills  a direct reference to the former administration, which often tied paying its UN dues to demands for reforms of the institution.        
	An array of world leaders sat in the hall for Obamas speech, which was often interrupted by applause and the flashbulbs of cameras going off, including some from delegates in the room.        
	But even as Obama sought to signal a changed tone in Americas dealings with the world, much of his speech centered on old and intractable issues, including Irans nuclear ambitions and a West Asia peace process. And while his choice of words was different and more conciliatory, the backbone of American policy he expressed remained similar to the Bush administrations in many areas.        
	Just as Bush once did, Obama singled out Iran and North Korea for their pursuit of nuclear weapons. In their actions to date, the governments of North Korea and Iran threaten to take us down this dangerous slope, Obama said.        
	Promising to move forward with ratifying the Test Ban Treaty, Obama reminded other countries of their responsibility to secure atomic material on their territory.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Stem cell ban
                                                                                                               Stem cell ban
                            
	Washington, March 9 (Reuters): President Barack Obama lifted restrictions on federal funding of human embryonic stem cell research today, angering abortion opponents but cheering those who believe the study could produce treatments for many diseases.        
	We will lift the ban on federal funding for promising embryonic stem cell research, Obama said to vigorous applause at a White House gathering. We will also vigorously support scientists who pursue this research. And we will aim for America to lead the world in the discoveries it one day may yield.        
	The decision was a clear repudiation of the approach taken by Obamas predecessor, George W. Bush. US law limits the use of federal money to make human stem cells, but Bush tightened the restrictions even further to include work using such cells.        
	Bushs decision prompted charges that he was basing his policy on politics and religion rather than science. Religious conservatives who supported Bush opposed embryonic stem cell research because it involves destruction of embryos, which they view as human life. Obama rejected that view.        
	When it comes to stem cell research, rather than furthering discovery, our government has forced what I believe is a false choice between sound science and moral values, he said. As a person of faith, I believe we are called to care for each other and work to ease human suffering. I believe we have been given the capacity and will to pursue this research.

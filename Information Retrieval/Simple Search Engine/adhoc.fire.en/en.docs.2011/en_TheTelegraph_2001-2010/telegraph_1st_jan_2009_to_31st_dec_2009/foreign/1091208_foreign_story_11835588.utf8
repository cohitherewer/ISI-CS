                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      16 killed in Lahore blasts
                                  
	Lahore, Dec. 7 (Agencies): A pair of remote-controlled bombs ripped through a market popular with women in Lahore today, killing 16 people and wounding 100, authorities said.        
	The blasts came hours after a suicide bomber killed 10 outside a courthouse in the Peshawar.        
	The Lahore attacks, timed to take place when the Moon Market in the Allama Iqbal Town area was as its busiest, left cars and shops on fire. A two-year-old was among the dead, a police officer said. One bomb exploded inside the market while the other was in the outer perimeter. The blasts went off within a minute of each other, witnesses said.        
	Officials at Sheikh Zayed Hospital said they had received three bodies, including that of a woman, and over 40 injured people. Six women were among the wounded and two of them were in a serious condition. Three bodies and 28 injured people were taken to Jinnah Hospital. Six children and 12 women were among the injured, officials said. Moon Market sells clothes and shoes and is especially popular with women and their children. Lahore police officer Chaudry Shafiq said 16 people were killed.         
	Punjab Law Minister Rana Sanaullah said the bombs were apparently remote-controlled devices. There was a blast. Then there was another, said Mohammad Nauman, who was bleeding from his nostrils. Nobody knew what was happening. Everybody was running. There was fire everywhere.        
	Lahore has been hit several times by militants over the past year, including an attack on the visiting Sri Lankan cricket team and several strikes against security installations.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Steel chairman among missing passengers
                                                                                                               Steel chairman among missing passengers

	June 1 (Agencies): The chairman of German steelmaker ThyssenKrupps Brazilian unit CSA was on board the Air France flight that disappeared over the Atlantic ocean, a company source said today.        
	Erich Heine, chairman of Companhia Siderurgica do Atlantico and a member of ThyssenKrupp Steels executive board, was among the 228 people on board, the source said on condition of anonymity.        
	CSA, a 4.5 billion-euro joint venture between ThyssenKrupp and Brazilian mining company Vale , is set to start production in December. ThyssenKrupp controls 90 per cent of the venture, while Vale owns the remaining 10 per cent.        
	French President Nicolas Sarkozy told families of those aboard the missing Air France plane that prospects of finding survivors were very small.        
	If all 228 were killed, it would be the deadliest commercial airline disaster since 2001. On November 12, 2001, an American Airlines jetliner crashed in the New York City borough of Queens during a flight to the Dominican Republic, killing 265 people. On February 19, 2003, 275 people were killed in the crash of an Iranian military plane carrying members of the Revolutionary Guards as it prepared to land at Kerman airport in Iran.        
	The worst single-plane disaster was in 1985 when a Japan Air Lines Boeing 747 crashed into a mountainside after losing part of its tail fin, killing 520 people.        
	Sarkozy, speaking at Paris Charles de Gaulle airport, said the reason for the disappearance remained unclear and that no hypothesis was excluded.        
	(I met) a mother who lost her son, a fiancee who lost her future husband. I told them the truth, he said. Sarkozy said it will be very difficult to find the plane because the zone where it is believed to have disappeared is immense.        
	He said France has asked for help from US satellites to locate the plane.        
	The area where the plane could have gone down was vast, in the middle of very deep Atlantic Ocean waters between Brazil and the coast of Africa. Brazils military searched for it off its northeast coast, while the French military scoured the ocean near the Cape Verde Islands off the West African coast.        
	Brazils navy said it was sending three ships to search waters about 1,100km from Natal.        
	Air Frances manager in Rio de Janeiro, Jorge Assuncao, said the two biggest groups of nationalities aboard were Brazilian and French. Other passengers were American, Angolan, Argentine, Belgian, British, Chinese, Filipino, German, Irish, Italian, Moroccan, Norwegian, Spanish and Slovakian.        
	Air France said the aircraft entered service in 2005 and last had maintenance on April 16. Air France-KLM CEO Pierre-Henri Gourgeon said the planes pilot had 11,000 hours of flying experience, including 1,700 hours flying this aircraft.        
	Sobbing relatives of people aboard the plane arrived at an airport in Sao Paulo to fly on to Rio de Janeiro, where Air France was assisting relatives.        
	Andres Fernandes, his eyes tearing up, said a relative was supposed to be on the flight, but we need to confirm it.        
	At the Charles de Gaulle airport north of Paris, family members refused to speak to reporters and were brought to a cordoned-off crisis centre.

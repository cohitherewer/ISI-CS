The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | AIDS vaccine breakthrough
                                                                                                               AIDS vaccine breakthrough
                            
	Washington, Sept. 24 (Reuters): An experimental AIDS vaccine made from two older versions has made major progress in finding an effective way to combat the illness, researchers said today.        
	But its application may be limited and a commercial vaccine may require more time.        
	The health minister of Thailand, where the trials were conducted, called the outcome a very important step for developing an AIDS vaccine. Two UN agencies said they gave new hope in battling the disease but more work was needed.        
	The vaccine is a combination of Sanofi-Pasteurs ALVAC canary pox vaccine and the failed HIV vaccine AIDSVAX, made by a San Francisco company.

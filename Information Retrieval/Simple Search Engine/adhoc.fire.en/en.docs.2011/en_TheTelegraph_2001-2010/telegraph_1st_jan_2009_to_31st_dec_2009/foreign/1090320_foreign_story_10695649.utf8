	William dream    
	 London, March 19 (Reuters): Prince William said his boyhood dream had been to be a policeman and that he has a Harry Potter scar as a result of a golf accident when he was a child.      
	The 26-year-old prince, second-in-line to the British throne, also bragged in an interview broadcast on Wednesday that he would beat his younger brother Harry in an arm wrestling match.      
	A long time ago I wanted to be a policeman, when I was younger, the prince told Alice, a 10-year-old cancer patient at Londons Royal Marsden Hospital where he is a patron, in the interview for the BBC childrens programme Newsround. William is currently training to be a pilot with the Royal Air Force.

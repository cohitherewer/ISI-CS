	Tegucigalpa (Honduras), June 28 (Reuters): The Honduran army ousted Leftist President Manuel Zelaya and exiled him today in Central Americas first military coup since the Cold War, after he upset the army by trying to seek another term in office.        
	Troops came for Zelaya around dawn and took him away from his residence. A military plane flew Zelaya to Costa Rica and CNNs Spanish-language channel said he had asked for asylum there.        
	Pro-government protesters burned tires in front of the presidential palace in the Honduran capital, Tegucigalpa.

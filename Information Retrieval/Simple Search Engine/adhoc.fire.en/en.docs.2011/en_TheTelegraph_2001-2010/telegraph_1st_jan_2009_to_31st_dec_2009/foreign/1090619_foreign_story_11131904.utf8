The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Zardari to skip NAM
                                                                                                               Zardari to skip NAM
                            
	Islamabad, June 18 (PTI): President Asif Ali Zardari has decided not to attend the NAM summit in Egypt next month, apparently to avoid another meeting with Prime Minister Manmohan Singh whose blunt comments annoyed Pakistan.        
	Prime Minister Yousaf Raza Gilani will lead the Pakistan delegation to the summit at Sharm-el Shaikh on July 15, the Pakistan Foreign Office announced. It comes a day after Singh said he and Zardari would meet on the sidelines of the summit.        
	At the start of their meeting at Yekaterinburg, Russia, Singh had told Zardari in full glare of the international media that Pakistan should not allow its soil to be used for terrorism against India.

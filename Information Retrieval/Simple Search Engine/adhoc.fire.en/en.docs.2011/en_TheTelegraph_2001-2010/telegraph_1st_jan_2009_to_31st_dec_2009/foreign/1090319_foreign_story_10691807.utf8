	Johannesburg, March 18: What might have happened in Pakistan this week or in Bangladesh a few weeks ago has unfolded in Madagascar but with an unexpected twist in the tale.        
	President Marc Ravalomanana of Madagascar resigned yesterday and handed control to the military, which then passed the power to rule the poor island off Africas southeast coast to his arch rival and former disc jockey, Andry Rajoelina.        
	This odd turn of events comes after two months of political turmoil during which Rajoelina, the former mayor of the capital, Antananarivo, repeatedly declared a parallel government with himself in charge, essentially announcing a coup in a democratic country. Rajoelina celebrated and consolidated power today, the 34-year-old now the youngest and newest President in Africa.        
	The dramatic events came close on the heels of the now-defused crisis in Pakistan during which some feared that the army was preparing for a takeover. Some parallels can also be drawn with the situation that prevailed in Bangladesh after the massacre of army officers by border guards.        
	In Madagascar, the ousted President wanted a handful of senior officers to succeed him. But in a ceremony broadcast from a military camp in the capital, Vice-Admiral Hippolyte Rarison Ramaroson said that he and two generals had decided to install Rajoelina as the head of a transitional government. We have categorically rejected the authority that Ravalomanana asked us to set up after his resignation, the admiral said.

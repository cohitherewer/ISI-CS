	Los Angeles, Dec. 28: The actor Charlie Sheen is reported to have threatened his wife with a knife in an incident on Christmas Day which led to his arrest in Colorado.        
	Sheen, 44, who starred in films including Platoon and Wall Street, was arrested in the ski resort of Aspen following an argument with his wife of 19 months, Brooke Mueller, 32. The TMZ website reported that he had threatened her with a knife. Police said a weapon was used in the disturbance.        
	 Earlier yesterday it was reported that Sheen is to undergo anger management classes. Sheen was released from jail late on Christmas Day on $8,500 bail and flew back to Los Angeles while his wife stayed in Aspen. He will have to return to court on February 8.        
	He faces potential charges of second-degree assault, menacing and criminal mischief, all of which were coupled with a domestic violence component, the Aspen police department said.        
	The actor, who is the son of actor Martin Sheen and brother of actor Emilio Estevez, is said to be determined to save his marriage to his third wife and will undergo anger management and marriage counselling, a source told People magazine.        
	According to celebrity websites in the US, the actors wife had been drinking when she called the emergency services and later recanted her allegations.        
	Sheens spokesman, Stan Rosenfield, said: Dont be misled by appearances.         
	Appearances and reality can be as different as night and day. It would benefit everyone not to jump to any conclusion. His manager Mark Burg said: There are no plans for divorce. They are both deeply upset about what happened and are trying to work things out amicably.

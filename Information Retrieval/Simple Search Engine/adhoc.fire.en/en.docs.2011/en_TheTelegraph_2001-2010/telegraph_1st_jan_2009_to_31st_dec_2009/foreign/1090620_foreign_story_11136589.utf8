                                                                                                               Iran cleric to protesters: stay off streets
          NAZILA FATHI AND ALAN COWELL                          Ayatollah Ali Khamenei during Friday prayers in Tehran. (Reuters)                                  
	Tehran, June 19: In his first public response to days of protests, Irans supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, sternly warned opponents today to stay off the streets and denied Opposition claims that last weeks disputed election was rigged.        
	He praising the ballot as an epic moment that became a historic moment.        
	In a sombre and lengthy sermon at Friday prayers in Tehran, he called directly for an end to the protests by hundreds of thousands of Iranians demanding for a new election. Street challenge is not acceptable, Ayatollah Khamenei said.         
	This is challenging democracy after the elections. He said Opposition leaders would be held responsible for chaos if they did not end the protests.        
	His remarks seemed to deepen the confrontation between Irans rulers and supporters of the main Opposition candidate, Mir Hussein Moussavi, who have accused the authorities of rigging the vote.        
	Ayatollah Khamenei urged dissenters to pursue their complaints about the June 12 only through legal channels, insisting that the turnout  officially put at 85 per cent  showed the ballot to be a reflection of the national will.         
	Speaking in front of an audience of thousands that included President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, he endorsed the Presidents policies and insisted that the margin of victory  11 million votes  accorded to Ahmadinejad in the official tally was so big that it could not have been falsified. How can 11 million votes be replaced or changed? he said. He went on: The Islamic republic state would not cheat and would not betray the vote of the people.         
	There was no immediate response to his 100-minute long sermon from Opposition leaders. Iranians had been looking to his appearance the national prayer service from Tehran University today for clues as to whether the authorities were prepared to bend to Opposition demands. But Ayatollah Khamenei showed no readiness to countenance their demands for the election to be annulled.        
	He blamed media belonging to Zionists, evil media for seeking to show divisions between those who supported the Iranian state and those who did not, while, in fact, the election had shown Iranians to be united in their commitment to the Islamic revolutionary state.        
	There are 40 million votes for the revolution, not just 24 million for the chosen President, he said, referring to the official tally that gave Ahmadinejad more than 60 per cent of the vote.        
	Ayatollah Khamenei said the election was a competition among people who believe in the state. He also spoke of the religious roots of our revolutionary society.         
	Despite all the diversions, our people are faithful, he said, but urged young Iranians to lead more spiritual lives. The youth are confused. Being away from spirituality has caused confusion. They dont know what to do, he said.        
	Google in Farsi        
	Google has unveiled a Farsi translation service to help Iranians communicate directly to the world, while Facebook has launched a version of its site in Persian.        
	We feel that launching Persian is particularly important now, given ongoing events in Iran, Googles principal scientist Franz Och said, announcing the addition of Farsi to Google Translate.

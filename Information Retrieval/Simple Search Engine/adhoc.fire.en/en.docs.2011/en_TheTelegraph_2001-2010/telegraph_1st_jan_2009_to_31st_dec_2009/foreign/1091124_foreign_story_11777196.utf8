	Tom bull break    
	 Madrid, Nov. 23: Seven bulls being used on the set of a film in Spain starring Tom Cruise and Cameron Diaz broke free and slightly injured two people.      
	Cruise and Diaz were not at yesterdays rehearsal. The actors are scheduled to arrive in the city of Cadiz, southwest Spain, for the filming of Knight amp; Day next weekend.      
	Two unidentified women were slightly injured by the bulls as they broke free from the downtown location and ran through streets to a nearby beach. It was not immediately clear if the women had anything to do with the film.      
	Director Jose Luis Escolar told reporters he does not know how the bulls escaped.    
	Becks zoo    
	 London (PTI): The Beckham household is turning into a zoo with Victoria and David rewarding their sons with animals when they get good grades in school. Beckham was so proud of his eldest son Brooklyns top marks in his homework, that he purchased a reptile for the 10-year-old. We promised him (Brooklyn) recently that if he got three As wed buy him a bearded dragon lizard, which is my worst nightmare. He came home from school the other day and handed me three sheets of paper with three As on it, so we had to go to (pet shop) Petco, said Beckham. Our house is full of wildlife at the moment, crickets, lizards and all sorts, but they deserve it, he added.     
	Laws story    
	 London (PTI): Actor Jude Law is facing fresh trouble with his formerwife Sadie Frost planning to write a tell-all story about their six-year-old marriage. The actress, who divorced Law acrimoniously in 2003, has signed a lucrative contract to write her memoirs. You couldnt wish for more in an autobiography. We havent discussed the finer detail, but we would expect it to contain pretty much everything.      
	 Sadie has a very good sense of humour and is very self-deprecating, said John Blake, the publisher.      
	 Frost was married to the Alfie star for six years since 1997 and has three children, two sons and a daughter, with him.      
	 She recently pledged her support to the British actor while he was torn between his children with Frost and his lovechild with aspiring actress Samantha Burke.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | A lean Cruise? You can make out why
                                                                                                               A lean Cruise? You can make out why
                              Tom Cruise                          
	Los Angeles, Oct. 10 (PTI): Katie Holmes has suggested a pleasure diet to husband Tom Cruise to keep the actor in shape.         
	Cruise is paranoid about gaining weight, OK magazine has reported. Tom had been complaining about how hard it is to keep off the pounds, so Katie vowed to help him out. Katie read somewhere that you burn up 600 calories just by having sex three to four times a week. So shes told Tom to think about how much theyd burn up if they put daily sex sessions on their schedule, a source said.         
	Tom thinks the sex order is the best part of Katies diet plan, and hes promised to up the bedroom romps whenever they are in the same town, just for the sake of his diet! the source added.         
	When it comes to advice, Holmes also falls back upon her husband. Elle magazine has reported that the 30-year-old actress blindly trusts Cruises taste when it comes to fashion.        
	Holmes, who is known for her elegant sartorial sense, said Cruise had great taste and offered her criticism on her fashion choices.        
	He usually likes everything, but sometimes Ill walk out and hell say, I think that dress might be wearing you. You dont need that, Holmes said.        
	The Batman Begins actress said her family was most important for her.        
	By whole world really revolves around my family. I do what I need to do, but its like, How is everybody else doing? And its wonderful for me as an actress to put some of that into a character, Holmes said.

	Los Angeles, Oct. 7 (Reuters): Actress Elizabeth Taylor said yesterday she was going into a hospital for heart surgery and asked for prayers.        
	Taylor, 77, was diagnosed with congestive heart failure five years ago and also has endured severe back problems and a benign brain tumour operation.         
	She made the announcement on her Twitter page, saying she wanted to break the news herself before the media found out.        
	Dear Friends, I would like to let you know before it gets in the papers that I am going into the hospital to have a procedure on my heart, Taylor wrote.

          SCOTT SHANE                          Cheney                                  
	New York, July 12: The Central Intelligence Agency withheld information about a secret counter-terrorism programme from Congress for eight years on direct orders from former Vice-President Dick Cheney, the agencys director, Leon E. Panetta, has told the Senate and House intelligence committees.        
	The report that Cheney was behind the decision to conceal the still-unidentified programme from Congress deepened the mystery surrounding it, suggesting that the George W. Bush administration had put a high priority on the programme and its secrecy.         
	Panetta, who ended the programme when he first learned of its existence from subordinates on June 23, briefed the two intelligence committees about it in separate closed sessions the next day.         
	Efforts to reach Cheney through relatives and associates were unsuccessful.         
	The question of how completely the CIA informed Congress about sensitive programmes has been hotly disputed by Democrats and Republicans since May, when Speaker Nancy Pelosi accused the agency of failing to reveal in 2002 that it was waterboarding a terrorism suspect, a claim Panetta rejected.        
	The law requires the President to make sure the intelligence committees are kept fully and currently informed of the intelligence activities of the US.         
	The disclosure about Cheneys role in the unidentified CIA programme came a day after an inspector-generals report underscored the central role of the former Vice-Presidents office in restricting to a small circle of officials knowledge of the agencys programme of eavesdropping without warrants, a degree of secrecy that the report concluded had hurt the effectiveness of the counterterrorism surveillance effort.

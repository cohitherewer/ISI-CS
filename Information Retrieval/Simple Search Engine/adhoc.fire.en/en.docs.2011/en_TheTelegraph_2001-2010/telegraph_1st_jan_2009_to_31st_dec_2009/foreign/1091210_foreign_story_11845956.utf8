	Baghdad, Dec. 9 (AP): The owner of a dog that miraculously survived a massive bombing returned to his collapsed home today to be reunited with his pet.        
	The ginger-coloured dog, called Liza, was spotted chained to a roof railing and standing on a wall ledge over the collapsed home after yesterdays huge blast near Iraqs finance ministry. Lizas water bucket was empty when Muheis brother, Fuad, climbed over the rubble to unchain it and carry her down. The dog was waiting calmly and even yawned as he approached.

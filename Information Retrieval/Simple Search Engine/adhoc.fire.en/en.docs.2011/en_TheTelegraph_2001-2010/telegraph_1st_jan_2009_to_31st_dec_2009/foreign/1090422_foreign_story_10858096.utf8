The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Troops battle into last rebel hub
                                                                                                               Troops battle into last rebel hub
                            
	Colombo, April 21 (Reuters): Sri Lankan soldiers battled into the last redoubt of the Tamil Tigers today, and an exodus of people trapped by the rebels in the coastal strip hit more than 62,000, the military said.        
	The International Committee of the Red Cross warned the situation was nothing short of catastrophic and urged both sides to prevent further mass casualties among civilians, saying hundreds had been killed in the past 48 hours. The neutral agency did not assign blame to either side.        
	The operation gathered speed after the militarys 0630GMT deadline for the LTTE to surrender passed without any word from the separatists, in what appears to be the final act in Asias longest-running war.        
	Sri Lankas military, in what it dubbed the worlds largest hostage rescue operation, moved in to keep the stream of people moving and give troops a clear shot at the LTTE and its elusive leader Vellupillai Prabhakaran.        
	So far 62,600 people have come out and still they are coming, military spokesman Udaya Nanayakkara said. Earlier, he said soldiers had reached the beach, which meant they had divided the Tigers last remaining area into two. He denied civilians were being harmed.        
	After the conventional end of the war, Sri Lanka will face the challenges of healing divisions between the Tamil minority and Sinhalese majority, and boosting a $40 billion economy suffering on many fronts including a weakening rupee.        
	But today for the second day running, the Colombo Stock Exchange gained on positive investor sentiment over the war effort and was at a more than two-month high. Sri Lanka is seeking a $1.9 billion IMF loan to ease a balance of payments crisis and boost flagging foreign exchange reserves.

	Syrupy Klum    
	 London, Oct. 2 (PTI): Supermodel Heidi Klum, who is expecting her fourth child, turned her pregnancy fetish for chocolate into a sexy photo shoot when she asked photographer John Rankin to click her in the nude and covered in chocolate syrup.       
	We were doing our normal shoot and afterwards Rankin said: Lets do some pictures... for the book. I said: I would love to be covered in chocolate. So someone ran out to the drugstore and got, like, seven or eight of those squirty chocolate things and they just squirted it all over me and he took the photo, the Klum, 36, said.       
	The pregnant model, who is expecting a baby girl, insists she had no problems washing the syrup off her body. It was yummy... especially when youre pregnant.I licked half of it up, she added.

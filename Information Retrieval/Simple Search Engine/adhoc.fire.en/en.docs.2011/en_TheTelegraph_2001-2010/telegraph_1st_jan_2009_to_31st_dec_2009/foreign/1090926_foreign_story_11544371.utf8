The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Picking a seat on BA to become costly
                                                                                                               Picking a seat on BA to become costly
          DAVID MILLWARD                              
	London, Sept. 25: British Airways is to introduce new charges for passengers wanting to choose their seats ahead of travel in a move which will add 160 to the cost of a long-haul holiday.        
	It would affect people who wish to guarantee they can sit together as well as those with a preference for aisle or window seats. BA, which lost 401 million in the last financial year, is imposing the levy as it tries to balance its books.        
	The fees, which also apply to those who book online, come into force on October 7 and follows BAs decision to reduce luggage allowances and to remove free meals offered to economy class passengers on short flights.Although some carriers allow passengers to choose their seats when they make their booking, BA only allows them to do so in the 24 hours before departure.        
	Those willing to pay will be allowed to pick a seat as soon as they book their flight. At the height of the holiday season, this will mean families having to find considerable amounts of money to ensure they can sit together.

	Kathmandu, Feb. 26: Nepal Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal, alias Prachanda, today said that his government would launch a fresh probe into the June 1, 2001, Narayanhitti Palace massacre in which 10 members of the royal family, including King Birendra, were killed.         
	While inaugurating the Narayanhitti Palace National Museum, Prachanda said his government was committed to unearthing the true facts behind the massacre. The official probe ordered by the royal regime blamed Prince Dipendra for the massacre and said that he had committed suicide after gunning down his family.

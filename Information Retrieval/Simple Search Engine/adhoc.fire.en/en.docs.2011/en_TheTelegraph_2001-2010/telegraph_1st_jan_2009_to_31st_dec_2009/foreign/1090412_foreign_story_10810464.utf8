The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | 12p in Obama ancestor will
                                                                                                               12p in Obama ancestor will
                            
	London, April 11: A British ancestor of President Barack Obama left 12 pence to his son in a will, it has been revealed.         
	Peter Blossom, who genealogists claim is a forefather of the US President, was a farm labourer in Stapleford, near Cambridge. Experts believe his son, Thomas, born in nearby Great Shelford in around 1580, sailed to America in about 1620 and the current President of the US is a direct descendant of Thomas.         
	Now details of Peters will have emerged  and revealed the contrasting fortunes of Obama and his ancestors.         
	In dividing his possessions, Peter wrote: First, to my son, I do give 12 pence to be paid unto him forthwith after my departure. He added: I can give unto him no more. Everything else went to his wife, Anable  who he described in the document as a good wench.         
	I give unto Anable my wife all the rest of my goods  these reasons and considerations moving me thereto because she has been a good wench as any could be, the document said. Historian Alan Bullwinkle, 88, of Stapleford, collected the will from his local record office after hearing about the 44th president of the US links to Peter Blossom.         
	Peter says that he regrets he couldnt give his son any more, said Bullwinkle. I dont think leaving him 12 pence  which is about 7.66 in present day value  was a snub. He gave what he could. Details have emerged of Obamas Cambridgeshire links over recent months. It has led organisers of the Shelford Feast to invite the President to open their showpiece event, held on July 12. They say it is likely Thomas Blossom attended the feast, which dates from medieval times.         
	Bullwinkle said he hoped to find records of Thomas baptism to build a clearer picture of his roots in the area.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Biden wife silenced for secretary of state slip
                                                                                                               Biden wife silenced for secretary of state slip
                                  (From top) Biden and Clinton				                           
	Washington, Jan. 20 (AP): Vice-President Joe Bidens wife said today he had his pick of being Barack Obamas running mate or the secretary of state nomination that eventually went to Hillary Rodham Clinton, a slip that Biden immediately tried to shush.        
	Jills comment came during an appearance with her husband on The Oprah Winfrey Show, taped at Washingtons Kennedy Centre on the eve of the inauguration.        
	Joe had the choice to be secretary of state or Vice-President, she said. Her husband turned to his wife with his finger to his lips and a Shhhh! that sent the audience into laughter. OK, he did, Jill said in her defence.        
	The Vice-President blushed, grimaced and gave his wife a hug while the audience continued to erupt in laughter. Thats right, he finally said to his wife. Go ahead. Jill said she told him Vice-President would be better for the family.        
	If youre secretary of state, youll be away, well never see you, you know, she said. Ill see you at a state dinner once in a while.        
	After the exchange aired on television three hours later, Bidens spokesperson Elizabeth Alexander denied Jills account in a statement emailed to reporters.        
	To be clear, President-elect Obama offered Vice-President-elect Biden one job only  to be his running mate, the statement said. And the Vice-President-elect was thrilled to accept the offer.        
	While the statement denies that Obama ever offered Biden the secretary of state job, it doesnt rule out that the two discussed the possibility. Obamas transition office did not respond to questions about their private discussions.         
	Obama made no reference to the comments last night, when he praised the Bidens at a dinner honouring his running mate at Washingtons Union Station. Obama invited the two on stage, where he kissed Jills cheek and hugged her husband.        
	On Winfreys programme, Biden said he didnt immediately take the vice-presidential offer since he wasnt sure it was the best place for him to serve. But Biden, who ran against Obama in the Democratic primary race, said he agreed after getting some assurances from Obama about his role.        
	This is a partnership, Biden said. Hes President of the United States, but as I said to him when he asked me, I said, Barack, dont ask me unless the reason youre asking me is youre asking me for my judgment. I get to be the last guy in the room when you make every important decision.        
	Youre President. Any decision you make, I will back.        
	Hillary delay        
	The confirmation of Hillary Rodham Clinton to be secretary of state will be held up for at least a day due to the objection of Republican Senator John Cornyn. The senator said he wanted a full and open debate and an up-or-down vote on Senator Clintons nomination.

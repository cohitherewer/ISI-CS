The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Obama ratings slide
                                                                                                               Obama ratings slide
                            
	Washington, July 20 (PTI): President Barack Obamas job approval rating has dipped below the 60 per cent mark for the first time as worried Americans doubted his handling of the recession-hit economy, the deficit and health care issues, a new opinion poll showed today.        
	The ABC News/Washington Post survey showed Obamas job approval rating fall to 59 per cent, down 10 points from its peak.        
	While 56 per cent of Americans still think Obamas approach will improve the economy, the percentage was down sharply from a peak of 72 per cent when he took office on January 20.

	Washington, Jan. 6 (AP): The first family leaving the White House this month will be without one of its longtime members: the Bush familys 18-year-old cat has died.        
	The First Ladys office said today that India, a black American shorthair cat, died yesterday at the White House. Bushs daughter Barbara, then 9, had named the cat India after baseball player Ruben Sierra, whose nickname was El Indio. The family affectionately called the cat Kitty.

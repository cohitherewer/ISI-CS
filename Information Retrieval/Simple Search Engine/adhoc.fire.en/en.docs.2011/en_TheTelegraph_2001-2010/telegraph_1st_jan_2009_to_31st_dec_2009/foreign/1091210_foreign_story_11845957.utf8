The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | US dual path to cutting greenhouse gases
                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      US dual path to cutting greenhouse gases
                              Environmental Protection Agency administrator Lisa Jackson in Copenhagen. (AP)                             
	Copenhagen, Dec. 9 (AP): The US for the first time outlined a dual path towards cutting greenhouse gases that would involve both President Barack Obamas administration and the US Congress to reduce emissions.        
	In Washington today, top Republican lawmakers asked Obama to refrain from engaging in any treaty negotiations at the UN climate conference in Copenhagen, arguing that there is no national consensus on it.        
	In the worst recession in 26 years, in the midst of an academic scandal and questionable science revealed in climategate and in absence of a national consensus about policies that would bear upon the category known as climate change, we gather here to say, Mr President, dont make promises in Copenhagen that we cant keep, Republican Congressman Mike Pence told a news conference along with six of his colleagues.        
	Speaking in Copenhagen today, Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) administrator Lisa Jackson described her agencys decision that greenhouse gases should be regulated as complementary to US legislation  not an effort to supplant the work of Congress.        
	This is not an either/or moment. This is a both/and moment, she told more than 100 people who packed a US meeting room within the conference centre.        
	 The EPA on Monday gave the President a new way to cut back on greenhouse gas emissions when the agency determined that scientific evidence clearly shows they are endangering Americans health. That means the EPA could regulate those gases without the approval of the US Congress.        
	The EPA decision was welcomed by other nations in Copenhagen that have called on the US to boost its efforts to cut greenhouse gas emissions.        
	The full US Senate has yet to take up legislation that cleared the Senate environment committee and calls for greenhouse gases to be cut by 20 per cent by 2020, a target that was scaled back to 17 per cent in the House after opposition from coal-state Democrats.         
	We need legislation to remove any uncertainty that businesses might have, Jackson added. The reason for legislation is to take that question out of their minds... We will work closely with our Congress to pass legislation to lower our greenhouse gases more than 80 per cent by 2050.        
	Jackson said the US would take reasonable efforts and also meaningful, common sense steps to cut emissions, but didnt provide specifics.        
	Negotiators today, meanwhile, worked to bridge the chasm between rich and poor countries over how to share the burden of fighting climate change, and the top US climate envoy, Todd Stern, highlighted the Obama administrations efforts to curb greenhouse emissions.        
	We are under no illusion this is going to be easy Stern said. But I think an agreement is there to be had if we do this right.        
	Lumumba Di-Aping of Sudan, the head of the 135-nation bloc of developing countries, said the $10 billion a year that has been proposed to help poor nations fight climate change paled in comparison to the more than $1 trillion already spent to rescue financial institutions.        
	China, which has recently overtaken the US as the worlds top greenhouse gas emitter, strongly protested a blunder that prevented a top diplomat from entering the vast Bella Centre where the conference is being held.        
	Congressman Pence said the President should refrain from engaging in treaty negotiations at the Copenhagen climate change meet in the interests of the American people.        
	America lost a lot of credibility when then Vice-President Al Gore promised the international community in Kyoto something that he knew that could never be passed by Congress.        
	I would hope that President Obama will not repeat Al Gores mistake when he goes to Copenhagen, Congressman Jim Sensenbrenner said.

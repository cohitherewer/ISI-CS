The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | US shares drone data
                                                                                                               US shares drone data

	Washington, May 14: The US military for the first time has provided Pakistan with a broad array of surveillance information collected by American drones flying along the border of Pakistan and Afghanistan, American military officials said yesterday.         
	But it is not clear whether the cooperation will continue. While American military drones flew a handful of noncombat surveillance missions along the border earlier this spring at the request of the Pakistani government, requests for additional flights abruptly stopped without explanation, the officials said.        
	The offer to give Pakistan a much larger amount of imagery, including real-time video feeds and communications intercepts gleaned by remotely piloted aircraft, was intended to help defuse a growing dispute over how to use the drones and which country should control the secret missions flown in Pakistani airspace, American officials said.         
	In meetings last week with President Obama in Washington, Asif Ali Zardari, Pakistans President, repeated his insistence that Pakistan be given its own armed Predator drones to attack operatives of al Qaida and the Taliban in the countrys tribal areas along the border with Afghanistan.         
	But the American intelligence operatives who fly the armed drones inside Pakistan remain opposed to joint operations with Pakistani intelligence services, pointing out that past attempts were a failure. Several years ago, American officials gave Pakistan advance word of planned Predator attacks, but stopped the practice after the information leaked to militants.         
	Were going after terrorists plotting directly against the US and its interests, said one American counterterrorism official. Nobody wants to gamble with those kinds of targets.

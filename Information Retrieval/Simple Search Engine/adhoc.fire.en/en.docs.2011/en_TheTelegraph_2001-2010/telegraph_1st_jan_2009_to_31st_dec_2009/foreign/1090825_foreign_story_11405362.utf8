	Hopkinscurry    
	 London, Aug. 24 (PTI): Hannibal actor Anthony Hopkins may have no taste for human entrails in real life but the British actor is a fan of spicy Indian food.      
	The actor stunned diners at an Indian restaurant by ordering a red-hot curry without any rice or bread.       
	Hopkins, 71, wolfed down the chicken vindaloo at the Spice Merchant in Cardiff Bay.      
	Owner Mike Ahmed, who runs the restaurant, said: We offered him rice and naan to help calm down the dish, but surprisingly he declined and polished off his meal.     
	Huge home    
	 London (PTI): They might just be a family of four, but this supercouple, Coldplay frontman Chris Martin and actress Gwyneth Paltrow, have decided to expand their London home into a 33-room mansion. The star got the idea from best friend Madonna and has brought the two properties adjoining their London home to create a mansion worth 7 million, reports the Daily Mail.

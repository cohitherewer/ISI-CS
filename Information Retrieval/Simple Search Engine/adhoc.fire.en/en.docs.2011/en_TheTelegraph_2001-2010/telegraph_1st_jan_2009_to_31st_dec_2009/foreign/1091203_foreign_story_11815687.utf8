	Islamabad, Dec. 2 (Reuters): A suicide bomber blew himself up outside Pakistans naval headquarters in Islamabad today, killing a guard and critically wounding two navy soldiers.        
	The violence comes a day after President Barack Obama announced a dramatic escalation of the war in Afghanistan.        
	The guard was killed as he tried to keep the bomber from entering the naval headquarters, according to Fazeel Asghar, chief commissioner of Islamabad. A 6-year-old child was also wounded.        
	The attacker was wearing a coat. He was asked to take it off and show identification. When he opened the coat, he was wearing a suicide vest which exploded, Asghar told reporters.

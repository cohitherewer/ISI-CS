	Jannat Abad (Iran), July 15 (Reuters): A Tupolev aircraft crashed in Iran today on its way to Armenia, after catching fire mid-air and ploughing into farmland killing all 168 people on board just 16 minutes after take-off.        
	In the worst crash in Iran for six years, the Russian-built Caspian Airlines plane, left only scattered bits of incinerated metal and fragments of the bodies of 153 passengers and 15 crew across a wide area around a deep smoking crater in the ground.        
	The aircraft, travelling to Armenias capital Yerevan from Tehran, crashed near the northwestern city of Qazvin shortly before 0730GMT.        
	Eight members of Irans national junior judo team and two coaches were among the dead as well as a former Iranian MP representing Irans Armenian minority and, reportedly, the wife of the head of Georgias diplomatic mission in Iran.        
	I saw a finger of a passenger on the ground. There is no sign of the airplane, just small pieces of metal, said a Reuters witness. I do not see even a complete leg or arm.        
	Weeping relatives and friends gathered at Yerevan airport where a notice on a wall listed people who were on board. Iran is home to thousands of ethnic Armenians. Doctors treated relatives for shock and heart problems.                  
	Six Armenian and two Georgian citizens were on board, the deputy head of the Armenian civilian aviation authority Arsen Poghosyan told a media briefing at Yerevan Airport. Two crew and 29 passengers were Iranian citizens with ethnic Armenian backgrounds, he said.        
	Fina Karapetian, an Armenian in her 30s, said her sister and two nephews, 11 and 6, were on board the crashed plane. I heard everyone in the aircraft has died. What will I do without Armen and Vahe? she said, before fainting.        
	The Tupolev plane has been totally destroyed and the corpses, unfortunately, have been totally burnt and destroyed, Qazvin police commander Massoud Jafarinasab told semi-official Fars News Agency.        
	A local official said the aircraft had technical problems and tried to make an emergency landing. Unfortunately the plane caught fire in the air and it crashed, he told Fars.         
	A witness said he had seen the planes left engine on fire in the air, state broadcaster IRIB said.

	London, Oct. 23 (PTI): Soccer star David Beckham was caught texting on his mobile phone as he drove home from a training session in Los Angeles.        
	He was photographed holding the phone in his right hand as he headed towards the freeway in his custom-designed Cadillac Escalade, reports the Daily Mail. It is illegal in California to use hand-held mobile phones while driving.        
	 The sports star has already been fined by police after he was caught making an illegal manoeuvre while driving in Los Angeles last year.        
	Beckham was also convicted of speeding in his Ferrari in 1999 but he successfully appealed the eight-month ban by saying he was speeding to avoid the paparazzi.

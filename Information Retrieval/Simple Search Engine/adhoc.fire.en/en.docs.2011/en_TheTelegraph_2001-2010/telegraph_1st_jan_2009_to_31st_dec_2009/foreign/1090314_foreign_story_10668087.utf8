The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Obama aide on leave over probe
                                                                                                               Obama aide on leave over probe
                            
	Washington, March 13 (Reuters): President Barack Obamas chief information officer has taken a leave of absence until officials learn more about an FBI raid on the office where he previously worked, a White House official said today.        
	Vivek Kundra, 34, who was named by Obama last week as the federal governments chief information officer, is on leave until further details of the investigation become known, the official said, speaking on condition of anonymity.        
	The FBI raided the office of the district of Columbias chief technical officer yesterday and arrested two persons as part of an investigation into employee corruption there, a spokeswoman for Washingtons mayor said. Kundra, who formerly held the post of DC chief technology officer, was not a target of the probe.

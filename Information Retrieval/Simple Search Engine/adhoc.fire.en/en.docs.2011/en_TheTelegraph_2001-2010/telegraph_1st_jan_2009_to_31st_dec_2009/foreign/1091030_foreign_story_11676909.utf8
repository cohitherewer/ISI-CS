The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | US economy grows, stirs fragile hope
                                                                                                               US economy grows, stirs fragile hope
                              President Obamas chief economist Christina Romer in Washington DC. (AFP)                            
	Washington, Oct. 29 (AP): The US economy grew at a 3.5 per cent pace in the third quarter, the best showing in two years, fuelled by government-supported spending on cars and homes.         
	Its the strongest signal yet that the economy has entered a new, though fragile, phase of recovery and that the worst recession since the 1930s has ended. Many analysts expect the pace of the budding recovery to be plodding because of rising unemployment and continuing difficulties by both consumers and businesses to secure loans.        
	This welcome milestone is just another step, and we still have a long road to travel until the economy is fully recovered, said Christina Romer, President Barack Obamas chief economist. It will take sustained, robust ... growth to bring the unemployment rate down substantially. Such a decline in unemployment is, of course, what we are all working to achieve. quot;        
	The much-awaited turnaround reported today by the commerce department ended the streak of four straight quarters of contracting economic activity, the first time that has happened on records dating to 1947.        
	It also marked the first increase since the spring of 2008, when the economy experienced a short-lived increase in growth.        
	Even if the economy climbs back into positive territory in the third quarter, it will be up to another group to declare the recession over. The National Bureau of Economic Research, a panel of academics, is in charge of dating the beginning and ends of recessions. It usually makes it determinations well after the fact.        
	The third-quarters performance  the strongest since right before the country fell into recession in December 2007  was slightly better than the 3.3 per cent growth rate economists expected.        
	Armed with cash from government support programmes, consumers led the rebound in the third quarter, snapping up cars and homes.        
	Consumer spending on big-ticket manufactured goods soared at an annual rate of 22.3 per cent in the third quarter, the most since the end of 2001. The jump largely reflected car purchases spurred by the governments Cash for Clunkers programme that offered a rebate of up to $4,500 to buy new cars and trade in old petrol guzzlers.        
	Spending on housing projects jumped at an annual pace of 23.4 per cent, the largest jump since 1986. It was the first time since the end of 2005 that spending on housing was positive.

                                                                                                               Claudia vows never to step on ramp again
                              new viewpoint                            
	London, Oct. 6 (PTI): German supermodel Claudia Schiffer has no plans to follow in the footsteps of contemporary Naomi Campbell and has vowed never to step on to the ramp again.        
	Schiffer has been modelling for almost 20 years, but insists that she had enough of strutting her stuff down the catwalk and now prefers to watch the shows instead of being involved in them.        
	Im finished with the runway. I wont miss it. I am still modelling and I enjoy that a lot but no more runways, Schiffer said.         
	Having appeared on over 500 magazine covers, the model and actress now enjoys to be on the other side of the fence. I can sit on the side and view the outfits and see all the detail and that suits me fine.        
	Its very enjoyable. I like my new viewpoint, she added.         
	Supermodel Naomi Campbell made a successful return to the runway during the London and Paris Fashion Weeks.

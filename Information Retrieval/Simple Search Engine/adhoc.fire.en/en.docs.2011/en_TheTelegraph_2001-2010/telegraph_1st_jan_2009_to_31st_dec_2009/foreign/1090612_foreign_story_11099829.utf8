	Leo loss    
	 Los Angeles, June 11 (PTI): Actor Leonardo DiCaprio has reportedly split with his supermodel girlfriend Bar Refaeli because she wanted to move in with him.      
	The relationship fizzled out because Rafaeli, 24, was keen to settle down and set up home with the actor, while DiCaprio was not ready to commit fully to her, reported People magazine online.      
	Theyre taking time off. For the time being theyve split. It could just end up as a break, but for now theyre doing their own thing, a source said. She wanted to move faster than he did, she wanted to move in together, so he broke it off.

	Paris, July 26 (Reuters): French President Nicolas Sarkozy was rushed to hospital today after falling ill while jogging and would stay there overnight to undergo cardiological tests, officials said.        
	The 54-year-old did not lose consciousness but had to lie down before being helicoptered to the Val-de-Grace military hospital in Paris.        
	Neurological tests after the episode were normal, his office said, and routine cardiological examinations would be carried out.        
	When he was jogging in the park of the Chateau of Versailles, the President was taken ill, his office said in a statement. This episode, which happened after 45 minutes of intensive physical exercise, was not accompanied by a loss of consciousness.        
	His doctor was nearby and attended to him immediately.        
	Sarkozy has cancelled an event tomorrow and a decision will be taken on his Tuesday schedule.         
	Television and radio quoted a source close to Sarkozy as saying he had suffered from a vagal problem, which can be linked to a fall in blood pressure, a lower heart rate and fainting.        
	This was not mentioned in the statement.        
	His wife, Carla Bruni, was at his side in the hospital.         
	Prime Minister Francois Fillon returned to Paris from his constituency to the west of the French capital.        
	The pavement outside the hospital had a heavy police presence and was closed to traffic.        
	French presidential health problems have traditionally been kept almost secret from the French public but Sarkozy promised to provide regular health updates when he took office.        
	The results of a health check were released on July 3 which said he had undergone blood and cardiovascular tests and the results were normal.         
	Sarkozy is a keen jogger and cyclist.

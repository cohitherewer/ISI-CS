	Washington, Nov. 19: The arrests last month of two Chicago men accused of planning an attack on a Danish newspaper have widened into a global terrorism inquiry that has led to arrests in Pakistan and implicated a former Pakistani military officer as a co-conspirator, government officials said today.        
	In India, where the pair from Chicago, David Coleman Headley, 49, and Tahawwur Hussain Rana, 48, are said to have wanted to attack New Delhis National Defence College, investigators are trying to determine whether the two men played a role in attacks a year ago in Mumbai in which more than 160 people were killed. Officials said they had not clearly established a connection.        
	The case is one of the first criminal cases in which the federal authorities seem to have directly linked terrorism suspects in the US to a former Pakistani military officer.         
	Headley and Rana were accused in complaints unsealed on October 27 of plotting against the employees of a newspaper in Copenhagen that published cartoons of the Prophet Muhammad in 2005.        
	Both of them are graduates of a military academy in the town of Hasan Abdal in Pakistan. They maintained email contact with other former students, including officers in Pakistans military. They belonged to a group of the schools graduates who referred to themselves as the abdalians in Internet postings, according to government affidavits.        
	Headley and Rana were accused in the complaints of reporting to Ilyas Kashmiri, a former Pakistani military officer who has become an Islamic militant commander associated with both al Qaida and Lashkar-e-Toiba.         
	The officials declined to name the other former military officer in the case, who is suspected as a co-conspirator. He is said to have recently left the Pakistani Army and held the rank of colonel or brigadier general, higher ranks than Kashmiri held.        
	One official who has been briefed on the investigation said that Pakistani authorities had arrested as many as five other people in connection with the plot in recent weeks.

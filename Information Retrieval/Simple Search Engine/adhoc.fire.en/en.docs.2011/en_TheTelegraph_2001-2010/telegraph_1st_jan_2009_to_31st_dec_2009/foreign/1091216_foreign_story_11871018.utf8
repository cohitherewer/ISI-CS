	Dera Ghazi Khan (Pakistan), Dec. 15 (AP): A suicide attacker detonated a car bomb in a market close to a politicians home in central Pakistan today, killing 33 peopl.        
	The attack in the Punjabi town of Dera Ghazi Khan badly damaged the politicians house and nearby shops and buildings, including a mosque and bank. It was unclear whether the bomber was targeting the home of the politician, Zulfiqar Khosa, who was not there at the time, or the market. The dead and most of the injured were people shopping or working at the market. As night fell, people searched through the debris for survivors trapped under the rubble. The whole market has collapsed, said Raza Khan, a local resident. There is smoke and people running here and there.        
	Rescue official Natiq Hayat said 33 people were killed and 60 wounded. Government official Hasan Iqbal said the attack was carried out by a suicide bomber. The attacker had packed the car with about 400kg of explosives, senior police officer Mohammad Rizwansaid. Khosa is a senior member of the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz party.

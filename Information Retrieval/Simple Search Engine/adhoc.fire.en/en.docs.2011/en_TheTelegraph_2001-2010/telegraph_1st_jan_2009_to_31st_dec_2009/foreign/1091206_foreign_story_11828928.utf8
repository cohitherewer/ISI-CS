The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | 109 die as fire sweeps through Russia club
                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      109 die as fire sweeps through Russia club

	Perm (Russia), Dec. 5 (Reuters): At least 109 people were killed and 134 injured when a blaze sparked by a firework show ripped through a packed Russian nightclub, triggering a stampede as revellers rushed to escape clouds of toxic black smoke.        
	The pyrotechnics show went disastrously wrong at the Lame Horse nightclub in the Russian city of Perm late yesterday when stray sparks ignited wicker coverings on the walls and ceiling during a party celebrating the clubs eighth anniversary.        
	As partygoers rushed for the clubs one and only door, scores were choked or crushed to death. Medics said many of those hospitalised were being kept alive with artificial respirators and that some had burns of more than 60 per cent. Some of the severely injured have been sent to Moscow.        
	A clubber who survived uninjured, identifying herself as Svetlana, told Reuters: Everything was catching fire so quickly as if it was made of hay, it happened in seconds... We could not all get through, everyone was pushing, from all sides.        
	President Dmitry Medvedev ordered a national day of mourning on Monday December 7 and demanded tough punishment for the owners of the nightclub who he said had repeatedly ignored warnings from fire inspectors that the premises were unsafe.        
	They have neither brains nor conscience, Medvedev told ministers in a televised meeting, scolding the clubs owners for failing to come forward immediately after the disaster. A Reuters photographer in Perm saw groups of distraught relatives of those feared dead as they trickled into a local morgue for identification. Others  some weeping or smoking nervously  stared blankly at the lists of the dead.        
	The fire follows a bombing yesterday which killed 26 and injured more than 100 on a train travelling between Moscow and St Petersburg, but Russian officials repeatedly maintained the nightclub fire was not another attack.        
	This is not a premeditated murder, but this does not lessen the gravity of the crime, Medvedev said on a video-conference with ministers who were sent to deal with the disaster in Perm, 1,150 km northeast of Moscow.        
	Interior minister Rashid Nurgaliyev told Medvedev there was no evidence of a bomb. Russian prosecutors said five employees, including the clubs owner and founders, had been detained in a criminal case on suspicion of breaching fire regulations and manslaughter.        
	Video footage obtained by Reuters of the disaster showed a merry crowd celebrating with a joyous show presenter suddenly announcing: Ladies and gentlemen, we are on fire. Leave the hall. Line up in a queue (to exit).        
	Then the camera jerkily moved to show fire roaring along the wicker-covered ceiling of the 500 square metre club. Many revellers slowly moved to a narrow exit  some still sipping cocktails. A few moments later, a stampede broke out as heavy black smoke quickly filled the hall and the crowd of more than 200 guests rushed trying to escape through tiny doors.

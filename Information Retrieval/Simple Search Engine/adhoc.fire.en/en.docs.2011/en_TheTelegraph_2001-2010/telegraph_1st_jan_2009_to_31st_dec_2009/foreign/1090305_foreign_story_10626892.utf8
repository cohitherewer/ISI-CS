	A street called U2    
	 New York, March 4: The Irish rock band U2 had a 1987 hit with their song Where the streets have no name, but today, Michael Bloomberg, the mayor of New York city, temporarily renamed a Manhattan street in their honour, The Daily Telegraph says.      
	To celebrate the release of the bands twelfth studio album and their appearance every night this week on CBSs The Late Show with David Letterman, part of 53rd street in Midtown Manhattan  where Letterman films  was renamed U2 Way.       
	Bono, The Edge, Adam Clayton and Larry Mullen were presented with signs reading with U2 Way  the name that West 53rd Street will carry for a week in homage to the band.      
	The Beatles had Penny Lane, Elvis lived on the end of Lonely Street, U2 singer Bono told reporters and fans on the corner of Broadway and 53rd Street.       
	Were here somewhere between 10th Avenue and funky, funky Broadway, somewhere south of Duke Ellington Way and north of Joey Ramone Place we find ourselves ... where the streets have no name, he said. Its a beautiful day, to quote a famous Irish rock band, Bloomberg said. Everyone in this city, including me, considers these four Dubliners honorary New Yorkers.    
	Hairy bill    
	London: Jennifer Anistons natural-look hairstyle, seen during her appearance on a red carpet in London, cost the actress almost 40,000, The Daily Telegraph reports. The straight style was chosen by the former Friends star for the British premiere of new film Marley amp; Me. The expensive bill for the cut came because Aniston, 40, flew her hairdresser Chris McMillan from Los Angeles to accompany her on a week-long trip to Europe. It is unclear whether the bill for his services was met by the actress or by the films production company.

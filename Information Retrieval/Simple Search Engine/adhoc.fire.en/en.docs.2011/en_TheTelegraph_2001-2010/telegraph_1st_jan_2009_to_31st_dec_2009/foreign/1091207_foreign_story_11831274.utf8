The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | US hand in securing Pak nukes
                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      US hand in securing Pak nukes
                                          
	Washington, Dec. 6 (Reuters): The US has helped Pakistan improve security arrangements for its nuclear arms and is comfortable the weapons are secure, defence secretary Robert Gates said in an interview aired today.        
	The Pakistani government has come under repeated attack from Taliban extremists, most recently on Friday when two suicide bombers eluded security and blew themselves up in a mosque in Rawalpindi, home to the countrys military establishment, killing some 40 people.        
	The attack raised concerns about how the bombers penetrated what should have been one of the countrys most secure areas. In the light of the blasts, Gates faced questions about the security of Pakistans nuclear arms.        
	We are comfortable with the security of their weapons, he told CBSs Face the Nation programme.        
	Asked how he could be sure, given reports the US does not know where all the arms are located, Gates would only say that based on the information available, US officials were comfortable with their safety.        
	We have a good relationship with them. Weve actually given them assistance in improving some of their security arrangements over the past number of years. This is not a new relationship. And I think just based on the information available to us that gives us the comfort, he said.        
	Pakistan, which has not signed the nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, conducted several nuclear tests in 1998. The country is estimated to have at least 60 nuclear warheads, possibly stored in component form, according to a US congressional research service report in October.        
	Concern about nuclear safety in the wake of the September 11, 2001, attacks on New York and Washington prompted former Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf to have the countrys nuclear arsenal moved to six secret locations, the report said, citing media reports.

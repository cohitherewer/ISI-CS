The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Khan: Pak helped Irans nuke plans
                                                                                                               Khan: Pak helped Irans nuke plans
          R. JEFFREY SMITH                          Khan in Islamabad. (AP)                                  
	Sept. 9: The creator of Pakistans nuclear weapons programme boasted in a recent television interview that he and other senior Pakistani officials, eager to see Iran develop nuclear weapons, years ago guided that country to a proven network of suppliers and helped advance its covert efforts.        
	A.Q. Khan, whom Washington considers the worlds most ambitious proliferator of nuclear weapons technology, told a television interviewer in Karachi that if Iran succeeds in acquiring nuclear technology, we will be a strong bloc in the region to counter international pressure. Irans nuclear capability will neutralise Israels power.        
	Although Khan has previously claimed nationalist and religious justifications for helping to spread sensitive technology, several experts said his latest statement was an unusually direct claim of broad, official Pakistani support for an Iranian nuclear weapon.        
	The interview with Khan was broadcast on August 31 by Aaj News Television. A translation of his remarks  describing covert purchases by Iran of equipment through Pakistans reliable suppliers in Dubai  was prepared by the director of National Intelligences Open Source Centre and posted yesterday on Secrecy News, a blog of the Federation of American Scientists.        
	The Pakistani government has repeatedly asserted that Khan acted alone in illicitly spreading nuclear weapons technology, and it has denied that there was official support for helping either Irans nuclear programme or North Koreas. But Khan, who has spent the past several years under a form of house arrest, has long insisted privately that his contacts with both countries were approved by top military officials.        
	In the interview, Khan was less direct about his contacts with North Korea. He confirmed that Pakistan obtained critical missile technology from the country, but he refused to comment at the moment on aiding its nuclear programme. US and allied proliferation experts, and some former senior Pakistani officials, have said that Khan assisted North Korea in developing a capability to enrich uranium for a bomb.        
	Several years ago, North Korea said it was pursuing uranium enrichment, then denied it. Last week, it said it was in the final stage of enriching uranium. Khan, in the interview, said North Korean engineers have visited our director generals in their departments to observe different operations. But he added that nuclear technology cannot be learned by visiting a nuclear site.        
	Stephen P. Cohen, a proliferation expert at the Brookings Institution, said Khan has always threatened to tell more  perhaps who authorised the transfer of designs and samples of technology, if not more, to several states. But, he said, Khan appeared to hold back a lot in the interview.        
	A spokesman at the Pakistani embassy in Washington, Nadeem Kiani, emphasised that Khan has no official status and that Pakistan does not want proliferation of nuclear weapons in the region These are the views of a person who has been rendered ineffective.

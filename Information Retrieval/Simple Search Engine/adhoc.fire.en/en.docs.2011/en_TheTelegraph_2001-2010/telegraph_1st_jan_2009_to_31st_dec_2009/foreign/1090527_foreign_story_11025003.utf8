The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Obama picks hispanic judge
                                                                                                               Obama picks hispanic judge
                            
	Washington, May 26 (Reuters): President Barack Obama nominated appeals judge Sonia Sotomayor to the US Supreme Court today, selecting a woman who would be the courts first hispanic to replace retiring Justice David Souter.        
	Obamas choice of the liberal Sotomayor, a 54-year-old judge from New York, was unlikely to change the ideological balance of the high court because Souter, 69, was part of the panels liberal wing.        
	Sotomayor, a child of Puerto Rican parents, is most widely known for her decision as a trial judge in 1995 to bar Major League Baseball from using replacement players, ending a nearly year-long strike. Some say that Judge Sotomayor saved baseball, Obama said.

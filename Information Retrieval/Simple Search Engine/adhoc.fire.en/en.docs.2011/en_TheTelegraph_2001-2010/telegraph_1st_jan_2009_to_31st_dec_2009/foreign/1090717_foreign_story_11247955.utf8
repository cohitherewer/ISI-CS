	London, July 16: Singer Amy Winehouse and her estranged husband Blake Fielder-Civil were divorced today after she admitted adultery in court papers.         
	Fielder-Civil, 27, was granted a quickie divorce from the 25-year-old star at a hearing in central London. Neither party was present for the proceedings  lasting a matter of seconds  before District Judge Michael Segal at the High Courts family division. The couple were married in May 2007 in Miami.         
	Fielder-Civil was granted the decree nisi from the singer on the grounds of her adultery. In divorce papers before the court it was stated that Fielder-Civil finds it intolerable to live with the respondent. In a question-and-answer style document Fielder- Civil is asked: State briefly your reasons for saying that the respondent has committed the adultery alleged.         
	He answered: The respondent confessed the adultery to me in April 2008.                     THE DAILY TELEGRAPH

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Pirates seize UK couple
                                                                                                               Pirates seize UK couple
                            
	Mogadishu, Oct. 27 (Reuters): Somali pirates said today they had seized a yacht in the Indian Ocean with a British couple aboard and were taking the vessel to the Horn of Africa nation.        
	The British couple are in our hands now. We captured them as they were touring in the Indian Ocean, a pirate called Hassan told Reuters. He said the two captives were healthy and ransom demands would follow.        
	A Seychelles government source said an emergency distress signal was picked up by the British coastguard after Paul and Rachel Chandler headed out into waters where pirate attacks are known to have taken place.        
	We are currently in touch with the family in the UK and the Seychelles coastguard who continues to monitor the situation and has conducted a search of the area, Matthew Forbes, British High Commissioner to the Seychelles, said.        
	Pirates have plagued busy shipping lanes off the coast of Somalia for several years. Foreign navies have warships in the area to try and prevent hijacks, but the sea gangs have started to hunt for ships far into the Indian Ocean.        
	The pirates typically use mother ships to sail hundreds of miles to sea and then launch attacks in small skiffs, armed with assault rifles and rocket-propelled grenade launchers.        
	The gangs  some made up of former fisherman angered by the presence of foreign fishing vessels in their waters  have made tens of millions of dollars in ransoms.        
	In their most audacious attack, pirates hijacked a supertanker with $100 million worth of oil on board in November last year. It was released after a $3 million ransom was paid.

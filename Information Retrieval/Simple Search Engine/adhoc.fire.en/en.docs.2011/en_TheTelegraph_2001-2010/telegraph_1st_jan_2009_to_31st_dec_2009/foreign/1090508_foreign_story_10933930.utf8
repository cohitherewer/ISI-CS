	Kathmandu, May 7: The possibility of a new government taking over before Saturdays deadline appeared remote today after non-Maoist parties failed to arrive at a consensus.         
	The CPN (UML), which is keen on leading the next government, held talks to finalise its strategy for the negotiation stage. The party is expected to formally announce the name of its leader who will head the government as and when it is formed.         
	Former home minister and Nepali Congress leader Krishna Prasad Sitaula said all parties had already agreed that the UML should leade the unity government. He said efforts would be made to bring the Maoists into the new coalition.         
	When asked about former Prime Minister Prachandas claim that his party would lead the government, Sitaula said there was no such possibility. None of us will accept the Maoists. leadership, he contended.         
	The Maoists on their part launched a major exercise to mend fences with the opposition parties. Prachanda who held discussion with UML chairman Jhalanath Khanal yesterday, called on former Prime Minister Nepali Congress supremo Girija Prasad Koirala this morning and sought to allay his fears about the Maoist game plan.         
	Nepali Congress leader Ramchandra Poudel told The Telegraph that Prachanda assured Koirala that he and his party would take all possible steps to build an atmosphere of trust among the parties especially in the aftermath of the Prachandagate Video scandal.         
	Poudel said that Koirala questioned the Maoists sincerity and commitment towards the peace process which came under doubt especially after television channels aired the videos in which Prachanda outlines his partys gameplan for a single party rule in Nepal Our party president told Prachanda that all the political parties had trusted the Maoists promise to embrace multi-party politics and democratic norms.         
	However the video betrayed the trust, he said adding that Koirala also told Dahal that his party had already promised to back UMLs bid to lead the next government.

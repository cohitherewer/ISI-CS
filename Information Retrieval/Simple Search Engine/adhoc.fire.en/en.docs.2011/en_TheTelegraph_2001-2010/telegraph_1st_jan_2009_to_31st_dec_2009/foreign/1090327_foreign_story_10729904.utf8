                                                                                                               Blast targets pro-Pakistan fighters
                            
	Dera Ismail Khan (Pakistan), March 26 (AP): A suicide bomber struck a restaurant in volatile northwest Pakistan today, killing at least 11 people, including pro-government fighters opposed to the countrys top Taliban commander, intelligence officials said.        
	The Taliban claimed responsibility for the attack, which also wounded several people.         
	The attack this morning, just outside the South Waziristan tribal region near the town of Tank, hit a roadside restaurant where some two dozen fighters loyal to pro-government leader Turkistan Bitani were eating, two intelligence officials said.         
	Local resident Ibrahim Khan said that he saw armed men trying to catch a young man in the vicinity of the restaurant. As the armed men grabbed that young man, he exploded a bomb, said Khan, who added that he saw 11 bodies.

	Tehran, Aug. 1 (Reuters): The trials began today of 100 prominent moderates arrested shortly after Irans disputed June presidential election and charged with trying to overthrow the clerical establishment, Iranian media reported.        
	This is the first time since Irans 1979 Islamic revolution that dozens of senior officials, including former ministers, vice-presidents and lawmakers, have been put on trial.        
	The official Irna news agency quoted the indictment as saying the charges against the defendants also included acting against national security by planning unrest, participating in the Velvet Revolution, attacking military and state buildings and conspiring against the ruling system.        
	The trial of some of those accused of being involved in post-election unrest started this morning, Irna said. Some 100 people were put on trial in a Tehran Revolutionary court. Velvet Revolution was used to describe the non-violent 1989 revolution in Czechoslovakia which overturned communist rule.        
	Under Irans Islamic law, acting against national security, a common charge against dissenting voices in Iran, could be punishable by the death penalty. The June 12 vote plunged Iran into its biggest internal crisis since the 1979 Islamic revolution.         
	Rights groups say hundreds of people, including senior pro-reform politicians, journalists and lawyers, have been detained since the poll.        
	US tourists arrested        
	Iran arrested three American tourists after what one Kurdish official said was an unwitting crossing into Iran from Iraq while hiking in mountains. They were arrested after entering Iran from Iraq, a source said.

                                                                              Tuesday , November 3 , 2009                                                                                                                                                                                            Iran capital to be moved from Tehran
                            
	London, Nov. 2: Tehrans days as the Iranian capital may be numbered after a powerful government body approved a plan for a new principal city in an attempt to protect residents from a dangerous earthquake.        
	Seismologists have warned that Tehran is liable to be struck by a catastrophic earthquake in the foreseeable future.        
	In a move aimed at avoiding mass casualties from the natural disaster, the idea of relocating the capital was proposed by the countrys supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, and rubber-stamped by the expediency council.        
	It is not clear whether a new capital will be built from scratch or sited in an existing city, the Guardian newspaperreports.        
	Iran has had numerous capitals during its history, including Isfahan, Qazvin, Shiraz, Mashhad and Hamedan. Since the Qajar king Agha Mohammad Khan declared it capital in 1795, Tehran has become the countrys political, social, economic and cultural centre.        
	The city is home to 12 million people, up from 250,000 at the start of the 20th century. Most recently, Tehran was the centre of mass street protests triggered by the disputed re-election of the President, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad.        
	Plans for a new capital were first drawn up 20 years ago, but officials only gave them serious consideration after the 2003 earthquake that devastated the southeastern city of Bam and killed an estimated 40,000 people. Experts warn that Tehran sits on at least 100 faultlines and that many of its buildings would not survive a major quake.

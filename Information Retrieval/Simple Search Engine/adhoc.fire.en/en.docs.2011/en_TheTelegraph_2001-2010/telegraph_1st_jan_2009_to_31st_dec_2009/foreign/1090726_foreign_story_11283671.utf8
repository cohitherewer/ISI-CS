	Calais (France), July 25 (AP): A French pilot today recreated the first-ever flight across the English Channel in a monoplane like the one that Louis Bleriot flew in 1909, complete with a wooden propeller, bicycle wheels and an engine about as powerful as a lawnmower.        
	Edmond Salis took off from Bleriot Beach, near Calais on Frances northern coast, at 0713GMT, arriving 40 minutes later in Dover. Thats just slightly longer than it took Bleriot, who made his historic crossing on July 25, 1909, in 38 minutes.        
	Before the flight, Salis dismissed any fears about flying the wooden and canvas craft, which dates from 1934. Its still an adventure. It is an old engine, it is an old motor, but it is well maintained, it works well, so there is no reason that any problem would happen, the 39-year-old pilot said.        
	Today, about 500 people were on hand in Calais to see Salis off, and five journalist-filled helicopters tracked his progress.        
	Saliss flight was one of several events, including daredevil stunts, a gala dinner and fireworks, marking todays 100th anniversary of the Calais-Dover flight, which helped usher in commercial aviation. Bleriot made his flight six years after the Wright brothers flew overland over Kitty Hawk.

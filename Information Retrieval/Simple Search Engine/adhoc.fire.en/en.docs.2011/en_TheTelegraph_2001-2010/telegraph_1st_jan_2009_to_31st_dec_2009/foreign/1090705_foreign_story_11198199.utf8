The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Playing by her rules again
                                                                                                               Playing by her rules again
          DAN BALZ                          A file picture of Palin with her son Trig in St Paul. (AFP)                                  
	Washington, July 4: Sarah Palin demonstrated once again yesterday that she is one of Americas most unconventional politicians, following an unpredictable path to an uncertain future.         
	That Alaskas Republican governor has a flair for the theatrical  and plays by her own rules  was underscored anew by her stunning announcement that not only will she not seek re-election in 2010, she will resign her office this month.         
	But are Palins rules those of someone with the capacity to seek and win her partys presidential nomination in 2012, as many believe is her ultimate goal, or of someone who has flashed like a meteor across the political skies but with limited impact? That question was at the centre of the discussion yesterday among Republican strategists who were baffled by what they had just heard from Alaska.         
	Palins decision to exit the governorship was as sudden and unexpected as her arrival on the national stage when Senator John McCain defied all predictions and selected her to be his 2008 running mate.         
	From that day in August to yesterdays announcement, she has been one of the countrys most compelling and controversial politicians  and almost always one of the most enigmatic.         
	Palins statement was ambiguous with regard to her future. We know we can effect positive change outside government at this point in time on another scale and actually make a difference for our priorities, she said, hinting at larger ambitions. But she also expressed weariness over what she called superficial, wasteful, political blood sport.         
	Was that a hint that she intends to turn away from elective politics? Certainly, after a week when she was the target of new attacks over her performance in the 2008 campaign  attacks that sparked a war of words between prominent Republican strategists  slipping into the background might be a welcome tonic for Palin and her family.         
	But even if that were her first instinct, she will feel the tug of her passionate supporters to remain in the forefront of the debate over the partys future, and many of them will push her to run for President.         
	One strategist who assumes she has presidential aspirations called the decision to resign her office quot;puzzling, and another described it as nutty.

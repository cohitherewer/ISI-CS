The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Bailed-out AIG in bonus storm
                                                                                                               Bailed-out AIG in bonus storm
          EDMUND L. ANDREWS AND PETER BAKER                          The AIG headquarters in New York                                  
	Washington, March 15: The American International Group, which has received more than $170 billion in taxpayer bailout money from the US treasury and federal reserve, plans to pay about $165 million in bonuses by today to executives in the same business unit that brought the company to the brink of collapse last year.        
	Word of the bonuses last week stirred such deep consternation inside the Barack Obama administration that treasury secretary Timothy F. Geithner told the firm they were unacceptable and demanded they be renegotiated, a senior administration official said. But the bonuses will go forward because lawyers said the firm was contractually obligated to pay them.        
	The payments to AIGs financial products unit are in addition to $121 million in previously scheduled bonuses for the companys senior executives and 6,400 employees.         
	Geithner last week pressured AIG to cut the $9.6 million going to the top 50 executives in half and tie the rest to performance.        
	The payment of so much money at a company at the heart of the financial collapse that sent the broader economy into a tailspin almost certainly will fuel a popular backlash against the governments efforts to prop up Wall Street.         
	AIG, nearly 80 per cent of which is now owned by the government, defended its bonuses, arguing that they were promised last year before the crisis and could not be legally cancelled. In a letter to Geithner, Edward M. Liddy, the government-appointed chairman of AIG, said at least some bonuses were needed to keep the most skilled executives.        
	We cannot attract and retain the best and the brightest talent to lead and staff the AIG businesses  which are now being operated principally on behalf of American taxpayers  if employees believe their compensation is subject to continued and arbitrary adjustment by the US Treasury, he wrote Geithner yesterday.        
	The senior government official said the administration was outraged. It is unacceptable for Wall Street firms receiving government assistance to hand out million-dollar bonuses, while hard-working Americans bear the burden of this economic crisis, the official said.        
	The bonuses will be paid to executives at AIGs financial products division, the unit that wrote trillions of dollars worth of credit-default swaps that protected investors from defaults on bonds backed in many cases by subprime mortgages. The bonus plan covers 400 employees, and the bonuses range from as little as $1,000 to as much as $6.5 million.

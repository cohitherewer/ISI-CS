          ANANYA SENGUPTA                          Bush at the Oval Office on Monday. (Reuters)                                  
	New Delhi, Jan. 20: Bye-bye Bush, the end of an error.        
	As viewers across the globe joined the countdown to Barack Obamas acceptance speech, barbs zipped across the virtual world at the outgoing American President who had done an awful job in office.        
	Bush is gone gone gone, wrote one blogger on a social networking site.        
	this is one tweet that everyone is talking about, said a message Indian teenagers were sending to friends online and as text messages, referring to George W. Bushs imminent exit after eight controversial years at Americas helm.        
	One page, the most popular so far on social networking site Facebook, summed up the anti-Bush mood.        
	January 20th is George W. Bushs last day in office. Hes screwed up our country for 8 years now, and finally America will be able to get back on its feet. Whether you are a Democrat or a Republican, we can all agree that Bush has done an awful job in office, and that January 20, 2009 is officially the end of an error, said the message on the page.        
	Not all messages, however, packed a pun or a gibe.         
	At least one was downright abusive. This is a farewell kiss, you dog, wrote a group on Facebook. Called One Million Shoes for George W. Bush, the group planned to reach its goal by January 20 before Obamas swearing-in.        
	It was the groups tribute to Muntadhar al-Zeidi, the Iraqi journalist who hurled the first and only real shoe at the President during a news conference in Baghdad last month.        
	While the shoe count was mounting for Bush, the Obama fan club was growing. Last viewed, the Obama Inauguration on CNN.com Live with Facebook group counted 1,077,700 attending members and 152,120 maybes.        
	As for Bush, blogging site Twitter was twittering with excitement. Many were planning grand outings or parties to celebrate the change of guard.         
	One more day and the Bush Nightmare is over! wrote one blogger.        
	Getting mani (manicure)/ pedi (pedicure). Mah friend getting waxed.in honour of the country getting rid of bush, said the online message that wrote about the tweet everyone was talking about.        
	On Bushs last day, viewers were also making a beeline to watch YouTube one of the videos that chronicles the Republican leaders most embarrassing moments in office. At last count, there were as many as nine million hits.        
	In the past one month, over 5,000 videos of Bush faux pas have been uploaded.        
	Hopefully, his advisers made sure Bush didnt log in during his last day in office.        
	Wouldnt have been a nice way to end an era, er, error...

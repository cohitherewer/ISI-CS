The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Sleep link to Alzheimers
                                                                                                               Sleep link to Alzheimers
                            
	Chicago, Sept. 25 (Reuters): A study in mice suggests lack of sleep may play a role in the development of Alzheimers disease, U.S. researchers said on Thursday.        
	The findings, reported in the journal Science, are some of the first to link sleep with the development of Alzheimers, the most common form of dementia.        
	Researchers at Barnes-Jewish Hospital in St. Louis studied levels of amyloid beta  a protein that accumulates in the brain of people with Alzheimers  in mice genetically engineered to have a version of Alzheimers disease.        
	Amyloid levels rose in the brain when the mice were awake, and fell when they slept. When the researchers prevented the mice from sleeping, it made matters worse, said David Holtzman of Barnes-Jewish Hospital, who worked on the study.        
	Sleep deprivation markedly accelerated amyloid-beta plaque formation, he said in an email.        
	When the team injected orexin  a compound that regulates sleep  into the brains of the mice, the mice stayed awake longer, and amyloid beta levels rose. And when they blocked orexin, these levels decreased. In people, orexin plays a role in the sleep disorder narcolepsy, which causes excessive sleepiness.        
	Holtzman said the findings suggest drugs that target orexin may be useful to try as Alzheimers treatments.

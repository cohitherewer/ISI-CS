                                                                                                               Romance as Liberty reopens
                            
	New York, July 4 (AP): The first visitors allowed into the Statue of Libertys crown in nearly eight years made the arduous climb today on an Independence Day journey laden with symbolism of freedom, national pride  and for one couple, romance.        
	Aaron Weisinger, 26, got down on one knee on the crowns small floor, pulled out a diamond ring and proposed to his girlfriend, Erica Breder.         
	Stunned, she whispered an immediate yes. To propose in the crown was perfect, the 25-year-old Breder said later.        
	Cheering the Walnut Creek, California, couple, fellow visitors also felt the gravity of the occasion.        
	I feel the Statue of Liberty represents global unity, a sign that our world must unify, said Barbara McLean, 57, of Atlanta.         
	After ascending the total of 354 steps to the statues crown, she sang America the Beautiful to applause from her fellow visitors.        
	I think it represents a beacon of hope that, even in difficult times, that dreams can be made, she said.

	Bullock bully    
	 London, July 16 (PTI): Actress Sandra Bullock says that she loved her character in the film The Proposal because it allowed her to be a bully.      
	She said that the role of Margret Tate allowed her to be in a bad mood for three months. The Speed actress played a hard-bitten publishing boss who forces her assistant to marry her so she can get a permanent US visa.       
	She stayed in character for months during shooting and admits she enjoyed every second of it, because she had an excuse to order family and friends around. I think you probably see the real me in this film! On set, at home, in the bedroom on weekends, you know what Im saying? But its liberating to just be like that for three months and say, Its OK, its my job, Im an actor.

The actor was hardly recognisable on Monday when he was photographed walking in a street in Los Angeles, where he is shooting for The Fighter which sees him play boxer Dickie Eklund.

                                                                                                               50 million jobs in global peril

	Paris, Feb. 15: From lawyers in Paris to factory workers in China and bodyguards in Colombia, the ranks of the jobless are swelling rapidly across the globe.        
	Worldwide job losses from recession could hit a staggering 50 million by the end of 2009, according to the International Labour Organization, a UN agency. The slowdown has already claimed 3.6 million American jobs.        
	High unemployment rates, especially among young workers, have led to protests in countries as varied as Latvia, Chile, Greece, Bulgaria and Iceland and contributed to strikes in Britain and France.         
	Last month, the government of Iceland collapsed after weeks of protests by Icelanders angered by soaring unemployment and rising prices.        
	Just last week, the new US director of national intelligence, Dennis C. Blair, told Congress that instability caused by the global economic crisis had become the biggest security threat facing the US, outpacing terrorism.        
	In emerging economies like those in Eastern Europe, there are fears that growing joblessness might encourage a move away from free-market, pro-western policies, while in developed countries unemployment could bolster efforts to protect local industries at the expense of global trade.        
	Recently, Pioneer of Japan said it would abandon the flat-screen television business and cut 10,000 jobs worldwide in response to sagging demand for consumer electronics.        
	Millions of migrant workers in China are searching for jobs but finding that factories are shutting down.         
	Even India has hit a wall. About 500,000 people lost jobs between October and December 2008, according to one recent analysis.

	Aniston, 40, will star in a romantic comedy, Pumas about two 30-something women who regularly chase youthful beaus.

	 London (PTI): Brazilian supermodel Gisele Bundchens photographs in the advertisements for London Frog have been airbrushed to remove any signs of her burgeoning baby bump. The 27-year-old catwalk beauty was recently snapped with a bulging belly, but the promotional shoots which show her wearing nothing but a trench coat, have been airbrushed to remove any signs of her pregnancy.

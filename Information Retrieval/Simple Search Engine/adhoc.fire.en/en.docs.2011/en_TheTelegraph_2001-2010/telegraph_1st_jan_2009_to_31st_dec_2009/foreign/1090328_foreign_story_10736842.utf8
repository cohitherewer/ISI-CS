The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Dam bursts near Jakarta

	Cirendeu (Indonesia), March 27 (AP): Torrential rain caused a colonial-era dam to burst its banks early today, sending a wall of muddy water crashing into a suburb of the Indonesian capital.         
	The flood killed at least 58 people, left scores missing and submerged hundreds of homes. Rescuers used rubber rafts to pluck bodies from streets that were transformed into muddy rivers littered with motorcycles, chairs and other debris. They predicted the death toll would rise.        
	Im devastated, said Cholik, 21, crying as he sat next to the body of his 54-year-old mother. His brother-in-law also was killed and his 1-year-old niece was missing. I wasnt home last night ... I should have been there to save them.        
	The earthen dam, built in the early 1900s when Indonesia was still under Dutch rule, surrounded a man-made lake in Cirendeu on the southwestern edge of Jakarta. It collapsed just after 2am when most people were sleeping, sending 2 million cubic meters of water cascading into homes.        
	Several survivors said it felt like theyd been hit by a mini-tsunami.        
	Water levels were so high in some places that people waited on rooftops for rescuers. Telephone lines were toppled and cars swept away, some ending up hundreds of meters from where theyd been parked. By mid-afternoon, hundreds of victims gathered at nearby Muhammadiyah University, which was transformed into a makeshift morgue. Many were wailing as soldiers and police brought in bodies, covering them in white sheets of plastic.        
	Cecep Rahman, 63, lost his wife, son, daughter-in-law and granddaughter in the disaster. I heard a crashing sound and looked out my window, he choked. The tide was so strong, like a tsunami. They were swept away. ... There was nothing I could do.        
	Health Ministry Crisis Centre chief Rustam Pakaya and rescue teams at the scene said at least 58 people were killed and more than 400 houses submerged, some in water nearly three meters deep.        
	A 9-year-old girl was found unconscious on one rooftop after the water receded, but she died on the way to the hospital, said a rescuer.

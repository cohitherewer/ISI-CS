          CHRIS IRVINE                          Live updates                                  
	London, Dec. 8: Google has announced that real-time news from Twitter and other information from the Internet will start appearing in its search results.        
	Under the new Google system, real-time information will feature directly in its regular search results pages. The freshest tweets on any online search topic will scroll past in real-time.        
	The announcement follows Microsofts own deal with Twitter and Facebook two months ago after they became the first to reach a deal to receive real-time updates.        
	 Now, immediately after conducting a search, youll be able to see live updates from people on popular sites like Twitter and Friendfeed, as well as headlines from news and blog posts that have been published seconds ago, said Google in a statement.         
	All these updates are ranked to show the freshest, most relevant results related to what youre looking for.              
	The tweaks to Googles search results follow the announcement last week that the         
	service was extending its personalised search to all users.        
	Google stores searchers users have done before for up to 180 days. In theory         
	therefore if somebody prefers a certain news website, it will feature higher in         
	search results. Users who are concerned about a breach of privacy however will be         
	able to opt out of the service. Previously personalised search was only applied to         
	search results of those signed in to their Google account.              THE DAILY TELEGRAPH

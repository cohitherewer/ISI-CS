	Beatles wave    
	 London, Sept. 9 (Reuters): A wave of Beatlemania struck Britains streets as a specially remastered edition of the Fab Fours albums was released today, complete with an interactive video game.      
	The Beatles collection, launched worldwide on 09/09/09 and priced at 180, is expected to dominate the charts in the US and Britain.      
	While queues formed at major music stores in London, there was also Beatles nostalgia across Europe and parts of Asia.      
	Ahead of the launch, Beatles singer and songwriter Paul McCartney wrote a letter to The Sun saying how he once imagined the band, which changed the face of popular music in the 1960s, would only last a couple of years.

	Tehran, June 24: Hundreds of protesters clashed with waves of riot police and paramilitary militia in Tehran today, witnesses said, as Irans supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, insisted that the authorities would not yield to pressure from opponents demanding a new election following allegations of electoral fraud.         
	It was impossible to confirm the extent of the new violence in the capital because of draconian new press restrictions on coverage of the post-election mayhem. But the witnesses reached by telephone said the confrontation, in the streets near the national parliament building, was bloody, with police using live ammunition.        
	Defying government warnings, hundreds, if not thousands of protesters, had attempted to gather in front of the parliament on Baharestan Square, witnesses said. They were met with riot police and paramilitary militia, who struck at them with truncheons, tear gas and guns. One witness said he saw a 19-year-old woman shot in the neck. Others said the police had shot in the air, not directly at demonstrators.        
	Some Opposition supporters said that presidential candidate and Opposition leader Mir Hussein Moussavi had been scheduled to address the crowd, but initial reports indicated that he had not appeared.         
	Earlier today, Ayatollah Khamenei told legislators that he insisted and will insist on implementing the law on the election issue, according to accounts in the state-run media. Neither the establishment nor the nation will yield to pressure at any cost.        
	Coupled with the clampdown on the new demonstration, arrests and other developments, the Ayatollahs comments reinforced the impression that the authorities have resolved to use all levers of power to choke off protest.        
	The coalition opposed to the election results suffered a setback today when one candidate, Mohsen Rezai, formally withdrew his complaints of vote-rigging, opening a rift among those who had challenged the outcome of the June 12 election.         
	Some opponents maintained their defiance, calling for continued protests and the release of detainees. Despite efforts to silence dissent and despite an appearance of disarray in Opposition ranks, Zahra Rahnavard, Moussavis wife who has played an influential role in the Opposition, issued a call today for the immediate release of Iranians detained in election protests, his website reported.         
	I regret the arrest of many politicians and people and want their immediate release, Rahnavard declared.

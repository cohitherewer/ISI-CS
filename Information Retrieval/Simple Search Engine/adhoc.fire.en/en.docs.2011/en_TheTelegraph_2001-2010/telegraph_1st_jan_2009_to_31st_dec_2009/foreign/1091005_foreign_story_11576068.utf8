	Washington, Oct. 4: International anti-terrorist officials are alarmed that the al Qaida is trying new body bomb devices that would enable suicide bombers to breach airline security measures.        
	Anti-terrorism experts held an emergency meeting last month after an al Qaida militant passed through several airline security checks with a bomb hidden in his intestine. He later detonated the bomb with a mobile phone signal, but failed in his attempt to assassinate a prominent Saudi prince.        
	While not wanting to be alarmist, I admit this is alarming, said Richard Barrett, head of the UNs al Qaida and Taliban monitoring group.        
	Even though its capability is reduced, it is clear that the al Qaida remains determined enough and inventive enough to cause another terrorist spectacular.        
	Last month US authorities foiled an alleged al Qaida terrorist plot in New York and also arrested two potential suicide bombers after they repeatedly tried to detonate large bombs using mobile phones.        
	Barrett was addressing the Washington Institute for Near East Policy, where he described how the terrorist organisations effectiveness had been much reduced across the world. The use of spies, targeted assassinations and the cooperation of governments had greatly reduced al Qaidas effectiveness, he said.        
	The organisation is losing credibility among its potential supporters and its recent efforts have not awed people he concluded.        
	Barrett also noted that al Qaida hasnt really made a connection to a new generation of young Muslims who have little recollection of the events and are less interested in religion.        
	The frightening episode occurred on August 28 last when, Abdullah al-Asiri, one of Saudi Arabias most wanted men, offered to give himself up to Prince Mohammed Bin Nayef, the head of Saudi Arabias counter terrorism operations.        
	Prince Nayef is responsible for overseeing Saudi Arabias much trumpeted terrorist rehabilitation programme, and some two dozen senior al Qaida terrorists have already surrendered to him in person. This time the would-be assassin, the ostensibly repentant Asiri, gave himself up and took two flights, one aboard the princes private jet, and spent 30 hours closely guarded by the princes personal security detail.         
	Aseiri was granted an audience with the prince at his private palace in Jeddah, by declaring that he would persuade other militants to surrender.        
	During the conversation a bleep was heard between two identical phrases repeated by the bomber and the man he is speaking to.         
	This keypad sound or text message may have activated a short fuse on the bomb, according to security experts. Asiri then declared that more al Qaida figures wanted to surrender and asks the prince to take the mobile phone.         
	Some 14 seconds later the bomb went off. The explosion blew Asiri to pieces and left his left arm embedded in the ceiling.

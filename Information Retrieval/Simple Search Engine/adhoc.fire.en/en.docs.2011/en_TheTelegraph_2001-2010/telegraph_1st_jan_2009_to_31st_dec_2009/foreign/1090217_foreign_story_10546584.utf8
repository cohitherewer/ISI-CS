The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Pak agrees to Islamic law in Swat
                                                                                                               Pak agrees to Islamic law in Swat
          NASIR JAFFRY                                             
	Islamabad, Jan. 16: The Pakistan government today agreed to impose Islamic law across the Swat Valley, North West Frontier Province, in an attempt to pacify a rising Taliban insurgency.        
	The agreement contradicted American demands for the Pakistan authorities to fight harder against militants, and seemed certain to raise fears in Washington that a perilous precedent had been set across a volatile region where US forces are fighting Taliban militants operating in Afghanistan and Pakistan.        
	The latest sign of the battle came early today when a suspected US drone fired four missiles into another area of northwestern Pakistan, close to the Afghan border, killing 31 people, according to a government official and a resident.        
	The agreement was signed after talks between Soofi Mohammad, a local Islamic hardliner and chief of the Tehrik-e-Nifaz-e-Shariat-e-Mohammadi (TNSM) and the NWFP government.        
	Swat is a favourite tourist destination and is often called the Switzerland of Pakistan. With its green meadows, high mountains and clear lakes, Swat has historically been a conservative region.        
	The agreement will be implemented in NWFPs Malakand division, which has seven districts including Swat, with a population of more than three million people. All laws repugnant to Sharia will be abrogated to enforce the new system of Adl or justice under the accord signed between the two parties, NWFP chief minister Ameer Haider Hoti said . He denied that the new system is similar to the system of governance that the Taliban had introduced in Afghanistan before their ouster in 2001.         
	Senior TNSM leader Mohammad Iqbal said that the militants would lay down arms with the implementation of Sharia. We will soon convene a meeting of our shura (consultative council) after which Soofi Mohammed will visit Swat and convince the Taliban there to disarm, Khan added.         
	Previous attempts at truces in the region have fallen apart, most notably last May. The US has strongly opposed making political concessions to the Taliban, urging Zardaris government to fight more vigorously.        
	That appeared to happen last summer, when the army began an offensive in Swat. But the move quickly stalled, with the militants effectively imposing their authority throughout the region.        
	Since then, Taliban leaders have proscribed what they call un-Islamic activities by residents, including watching television, dancing and shaving beards, and they have sometimes beheaded offenders. The penalties are regularly, and terrifyingly, announced over radio stations under the militants control. Thousands of residents of the area have fled the intimidation and violence.        
	Musharraf denial        
	Former Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf denied today playing a double game of supporting the Taliban while receiving US funding to fight them when he was in power.

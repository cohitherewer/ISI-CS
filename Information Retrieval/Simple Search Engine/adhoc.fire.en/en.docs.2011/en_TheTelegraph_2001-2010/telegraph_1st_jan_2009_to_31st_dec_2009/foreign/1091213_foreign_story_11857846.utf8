	Islamabad, Dec. 12 (AP): Five young American men under investigation in Pakistan for alleged terror links had established contact with a Taliban recruiter and have told FBI officials they were on a mission to be martyred, a Pakistani police official said.        
	The five Muslim students were being questioned today by local law enforcement and intelligence agencies in Lahore, Sargodha town police chief Usman Anwar said.        
	The main contact of the five men in Pakistan was a Taliban recruiter who went by the name Saifullah, Anwar said. He would not give any more details about the recruiter, but said Saifullah may have planned to take the men to Mianwali.

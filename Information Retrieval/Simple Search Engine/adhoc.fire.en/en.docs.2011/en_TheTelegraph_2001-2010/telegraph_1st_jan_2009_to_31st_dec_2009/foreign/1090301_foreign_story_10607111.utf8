	Parrot power    
	 London, Feb. 28: A US fireman who lost his power of speech in a traffic accident has been taught to speak again by parrots, reports The Daily Telegraph.       
	 Wilson, from Damascus, Maryland, suffered life-threatening injuries in the accident 14 years ago. He also lost his ability to speak.       
	But he now claims that the chatter of pet parrots confounded the bleak outlook of doctors, who were convinced that he would spend the rest of his life in bed at a nursing home. Two birds taught me to talk again, he said. I had such a bad head injury I was never supposed to talk any more than a two-year-old. To show his gratitude to the birds who helped him on the path to rehabilitation, Wilson has devoted his life to feathered pets whose owners are no longer able or want to keep them.     
	Hollow raid    
	 London: Police raided a property after heat-seeking cameras identified a suspected cannabis factory  only to discover nothing more sinister than a wood-burning stove. Officers obtained a search warrant and broke through a door at Colin Rowes workshop in Huddersfield, Yorkshire, after an infra-red police helicopter camera picked up unusual heat patterns.

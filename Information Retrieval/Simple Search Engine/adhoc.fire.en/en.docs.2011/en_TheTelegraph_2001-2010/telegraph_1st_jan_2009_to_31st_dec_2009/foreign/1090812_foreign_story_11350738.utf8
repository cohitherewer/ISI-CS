The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Sentence to keep Suu Kyi out of polls
                                                                                                               Sentence to keep Suu Kyi out of polls
          SETH MYDANS                          Suu Kyi: Convicted                                  
	Bangkok, Aug. 11: Burmese pro-democracy leader Aung San Suu Kyi was today sentenced to three years of hard labour for violating the terms of her house arrest, but her sentence was quickly commuted to a term of house arrest of up to 18 months.        
	She presumably will be allowed to leave the prison guest house where she has been held since the trial began on May 18 and return to the villa where Myanmars ruling junta has kept her confined for 14 of the past 20 years. Suu Kyi, 64, had faced a possible jail term of five years.        
	The 18-month term will ensure that Suu Kyi will be confined during a parliamentary election due next year.         
	Many analysts have said they believe the case against her is intended to keep her from participating in the polls.        
	The outcome of this trial has never been in doubt, Jared Genser, her international counsel in Washington, said today after the verdict was announced. The real question is how the international community will react  will it do more than simply condemn this latest injustice?        
	The charge against Suu Kyi was prompted by a strange incident in early May when an American intruder swam across a lake in central Yangon and spent two nights in her villa saying he wanted to save her from assassins.        
	John Yettaw, 53, of Missouri, was given a seven-year sentence today for abetting Suu Kyis actions and for violating immigration law, diplomats in Yangon said.        
	According to news agency reporters allowed inside the courtroom to hear the reading of the three-year sentence, a five-minute recess was called after the verdict was given, and Myanmars home minister, Maung Oo, entered the court and read aloud an order of commutation issued by Senior General Than Shwe, the leader of the junta.         
	The junta has come under severe international pressure since Suu Kyis arrest, and analysts said the regime might seek to appear lenient by commuting a conviction to house arrest.        
	Her lawyer, U Nyan Win, said Suu Kyi had been prepared for the worst and had collected a supply of reading matter and medications to sustain her.

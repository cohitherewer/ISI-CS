The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Keira beats Scarlett to My Fair Lady role
                                                                                                               Keira beats Scarlett to My Fair Lady role
          TIM WALKER                            Knightley (top) and Johansson                                
	London, Oct. 24: Keira Knightley may not yet have won any awards for her acting, but she has become the victor in a battle close to her heart.        
	The 24-year-old actress has beaten Scarlett Johansson to the part of Eliza Doolittle in a new film adaptation of My Fair Lady.        
	Her victory comes as Joe Wright, who inspired Knightley to her best performance in Pride and Prejudice, has been chosen to direct the film.        
	Joe and Keira are looking forward to working together again immensely, said a friend of the 37-year-old director.        
	In August, it was reported that Knightley had been forced to compete with Johansson, 24, for the role of the Cockney flower seller played by Audrey Hepburn in the 1964 film.        
	I have two actresses as potential Elizas, one British, the other American, said Sir Cameron Mackintosh, who is producing the film with Duncan Kenworthy, at the time. Youd know their names, but Im not letting on.        
	Last week, Kenworthy said: I think Keira would be absolutely fabulous in it. Emma Thompson is writing the script for the film, for which Daniel Craig has been mooted as a possible Prof. Henry Higgins.        
	After it was disclosed in 2006 that Knightley was being lined up for the part by Sir Cameron, she confirmed last year that she had auditioned and begun singing lessons.        
	Wright had been due to direct Indian Summer, a film about the relationship between Countess Mountbatten and Jawaharlal Nehru but he has been forced to abandon it after nine months work. The Indian government had expressed concern about its portrayal of the alleged love affair.

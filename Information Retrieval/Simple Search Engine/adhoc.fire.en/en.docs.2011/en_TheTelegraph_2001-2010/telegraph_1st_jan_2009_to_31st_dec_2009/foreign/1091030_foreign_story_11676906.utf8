	Minogue bares all    
	 London, Oct. 29: Dannii Minogue stripped naked for adult magazine Playboy to clear 150,000 debts, the X Factor judge has disclosed, reports The Daily Telegraph.      
	Minogue admitted that she decided to bare all for the magazine in 1995 when she found herself in the midst of a financial crisis after her split with husband, actor Julian McMahon.      
	The 38-year-old X Factor judge admitted her parents did not want her to pose in the magazine but said she did not want to ask sister Kylie for money.    
	Bruni home    
	 New York (Reuters): If you have always wanted to live like an Italian heiress, supermodel, pop star and wife of a European head of state, there is a castle on the market in Turin that might be worth a look. The historic home in the Italian hills where French First Lady Carla Bruni-Sarkozy spent her early childhood is staking a for sale sign once again, just months after a Saudi billionaire bought the palatial property for $25 million.    
	Pitt fears    
	 Los Angeles (PTI): Actor Brad Pitts worst fear came alive as he panicked over how his partner Angelina Jolie would react to the news of his motorcycle accident. The 45-year-old actor met with an accident while trying to weave between cars at a red light in Los Angeles. He asked for help from a friend and told her that he was more concerned about Jolies reaction than the damage to his beloved bike.

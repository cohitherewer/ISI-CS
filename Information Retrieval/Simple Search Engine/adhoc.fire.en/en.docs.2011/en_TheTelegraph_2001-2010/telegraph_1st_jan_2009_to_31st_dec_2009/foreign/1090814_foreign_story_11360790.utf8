          HENRY SAMUEL                          Strong rumours                                  
	Paris, Aug. 13: Nicolas Sarkozy and Carla Bruni-Sarkozy are planning to have their first child together in 2011 to aid the French Presidents chances of clinching a second term the following year, a French magazine is speculating.        
	Rumours that Frances first couple had set a precise date for starting a family were revealed by the popular weekly magazine Voici (www.voici.fr).        
	Sarkozy, 54, has three children from two previous marriages, while his Italian-born former supermodel wife, 41, has one son from a previous relationship.        
	Quoting sources in the National Assembly, the lower house of parliament, Voici wrote: The presidential couple are thought to have chosen to keep the pregnancy card up their sleeve to ensure public sympathy ahead of the next presidential campaign in 2012. The rumour has been circulating for several weeks.        
	Bruni-Sarkozy has made no secret of the fact that the couple hope to have a child together. Im not pregnant and I regret it because I love it when I am. Will it happen? Its difficult for me to say. Its much more difficult at 40 than it is at 25, she said in an interview last year. But neither she nor her husband has ever set a birth date.

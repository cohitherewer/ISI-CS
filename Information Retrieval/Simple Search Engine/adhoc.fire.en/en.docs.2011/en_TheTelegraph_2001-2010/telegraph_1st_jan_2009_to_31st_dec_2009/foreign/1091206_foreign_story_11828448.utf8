                              Trip planned                            
	London, Dec. 5 (PTI): Christmas has come early for actor Morgan Freeman who has treated himself with a private plane.        
	The veteran star joins a select group of Hollywood A-listers like Harrison Ford, Tom Cruise, John Travolta, Angelina Jolie, Hilary Swank and supermodel Gisele Bundchen who are all keen pilots.         
	The 72-year-old actor, who had joined the US Air Force when he was young, started taking flying lessons in 2002 and quickly went on to earn his pilots licence.         
	Freeman is planning to take the aircraft on a journey around the world, reports www.Contactmusic.com.        
	Im flying from here (US) to South Africa. Then, since weve got some business down there, were going to Botswana... then were going to go to Kenya, northern Kenya, because weve been invited to visit a local tribe.         
	The reason were doing all this is because Ive got my own plane. Brand new. Me and my co-pilot (will be flying it), Freeman said. The Driving Miss Daisy star has bragged that his jet would put other celebrity pilots and their planes to shame.

                                                                                                               Jackson doctor clinic searched
                            
	Houston, July 22 (AP): Los Angeles police and federal drug agents searched the Houston clinic of Michael Jacksons doctor today, even as investigators in California sought more information from him.        
	The police and agents from the US Drug Enforcement Administration were searching Dr Conrad Murrays clinic in north Houston, Los Angeles police detective Dan Myers said.        
	 Houston police surrounded the building as the investigators went inside. DEA spokeswoman Violet Szeleczky said about 20 people were in the Armstrong Medical Clinic, including employees.        
	Murray has emerged as a central figure in the investigation into Jacksons death. The doctor, who had been recently hired by Jackson, was with him in his mansion and tried to revive him.         
	He has been interviewed by police but he has not been considered a suspect in the singers death.

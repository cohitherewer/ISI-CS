	Costly spill    
	 London, March 16: A hapless Buckingham Palace footman caused 60,000 worth of damage to a new carpet when he spilled a trolley of drinks, reports The Daily Telegraph.       
	The accident happened in the Picture Gallery which had just been recarpeted at great expense two days before. The 156ft-long room is the size of two tennis courts. The footman was wheeling the trolley of hot drinks across it when one of the wheels fell off and the drinks scattered.     
	Bill shock    
	 London: A man has received a phone bill for almost 22,000 after downloading television programmes during a skiing holiday, reports The Daily Telegraph. Will Pierce, 42, said that he and his son Louis, eight, had downloaded episodes of Top Gear and Kavanagh QC because their hotel had no English television channels. He had assumed that the cost of the downloads would be covered by his 25 Vodafone data card, which gave him access to mobile broadband while abroad. However, when he returned home from the five-day trip to Meribel, he was shocked to be given a phone bill for 21,716. He had been charged per megabyte of data he received, meaning one television programme cost about 5,000.    
	Food police    
	 London: A primary school was accused of running a mealtime Gestapo after inspecting childrens lunchboxes for unhealthy food, reports The Daily Telegraph. Pupils with sweets, chocolate, fizzy drinks or full-fat crisps, had them confiscated and put in the staffroom. They are returned at the end of the day. One parent, Magdi Cullen, 34, told the Daily Mail: When I found out about what they were doing, I thought : This is a primary school, not Guantanamo Bay.

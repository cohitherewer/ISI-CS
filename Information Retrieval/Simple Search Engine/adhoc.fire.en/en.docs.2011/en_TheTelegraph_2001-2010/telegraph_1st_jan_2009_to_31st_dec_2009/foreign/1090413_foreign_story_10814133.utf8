	Bangkok, April 12 (Reuters): Thailand Prime Minister Abhisit Vejjajiva declared a state of Emergency today to quell political unrest and threatened to take tough action against protesters who were gathering in greater numbers in Bangkok.        
	Troops fired into the air when anti-government protesters stormed the interior ministry later today. The crowds mobbed the Prime Ministers car and beat it with clubs as he drove away from the ministry.        
	Supporters of former Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra triggered the Emergency when they stormed the venue of an Asian summit in the southern resort of Pattaya yesterday, forcing the government to cancel the meetings.        
	After declaring victory there, the Thaksin supporters have been gathering all day at Government House in central Bangkok. By noon, they numbered around 40,000.        
	In his nightly phone-in to the demonstration, Thaksin said now was the golden time for the protesters to rise up against the government after soldiers were deployed on Bangkok streets. Thaksin is in exile somewhere abroad.        
	He repeated his call for a peoples revolution and said he was ready to move back to Thailand to lead a peoples uprising if there was a coup.        
	Abhisit appeared on television to warn Thaksins supporters they face tough measures under the state of Emergency.        
	We want to ask you to stop such action. It is necessary for the government to adopt the measures allowed in the Emergency decree, in order to get the nation back to peace, he said in a statement, hours after his car was attacked.        
	Some armoured vehicles have appeared on the streets but no action has been reported.

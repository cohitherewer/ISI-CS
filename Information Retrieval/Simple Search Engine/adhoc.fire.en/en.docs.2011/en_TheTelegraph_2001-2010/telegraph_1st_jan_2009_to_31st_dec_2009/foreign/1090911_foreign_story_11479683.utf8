The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Gilani no to sweet dishes
                                                                                                               Gilani no to sweet dishes
                            
	Islamabad, Sept. 10 (Reuters): Pakistani Prime Minister Yousaf Raza Gilani has ordered his cook to stop making sweet dishes as part of a drive to bring down the price of sugar.        
	With public pressure mounting during Ramazan, Gilani has sought to set a personal example. The orders are being implemented from today, an official at the Prime Ministers House said. He wants to tell the people that they can live healthier by taking less sugar. Sugar prices surged in Pakistan ahead of Ramazan, which began last month.

	Cellulite Cindy  
	 London, Aug. 26 (PTI): Supermodel Cindy Crawford may be famous for her ageless beauty but even she suffers from cellulite and is not ashamed to admit it.      
	The 43-year-old model and actress says that she loves to flaunt her body in a bikini while on the beach even though she knows her lumpy thighs will be criticised.      
	I have cellulite. I admit it. But sometimes I just say: Screw it, I am going to wear a bikini and I am not putting on a cover-up, Crawford told Redbook magazine.      
	I think I look good for my age. I am not 25, I am 43. That feels like a big pressure, especially when a magazine is dying to get a picture. I am so aware that I dont want to change the way I live because of that kind of attention. You just brace yourself for a bad picture.     
	Pinto pair    
	London (PTI): Slumdog Millionaire beauty Freida Pinto may be romancing a younger man, Dev Patel, in real life, but she has been paired opposite actor Josh Broilin, who is a good two decades older than her, in Woody Allens latest film. The unlikely pair were seen shooting together in London, with Woody Allen having to order artificial rain for a romantic sequence in the yet to be named film.    
	Flab fight

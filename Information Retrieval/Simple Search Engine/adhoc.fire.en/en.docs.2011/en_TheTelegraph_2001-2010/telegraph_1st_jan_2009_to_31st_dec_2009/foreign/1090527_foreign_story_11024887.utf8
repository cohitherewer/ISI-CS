	Pinto advice    
	 London, May 26 (PTI) : Wrestler star Mickey Rourke had advised Indian actress Freida Pinto to go home on Oscars night as the actor thought she was too young to be at the party.      
	The Golden Globe winning actor approached Pinto at the Academy Award ceremony last February and told her to go home and sleep, reports www.femalefirst.com.      
	Mickey Rourke gave me a telling off at the Oscars. He said to me: Its way past your bedtime  go home, which was funny!, Pinto said. She is currently in Tel Aviv shooting for an Israeli film called Miral.

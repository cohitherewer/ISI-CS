	Polanski bail blow    
	 Zurich, Oct. 6: Director Roman Polanski has lost his bid to be bailed from prison in Switzerland ahead of his possible extradition to the US over his 1977 conviction for unlawful sex with a 13-year-old-girl, Samantha Geimer, reports The Daily Telegraph.      
	We continue to be of the opinion that there is a high risk of flight, said Folco Galli, a Swiss justice ministry spokesman. He said the risk was too great for the government to accept bail or other security measures in exchange for the filmmakers release.      
	Polanski, 76, was arrested on September 26 as he arrived in Zurich to receive an award from a film festival.       
	His legal representatives are also asking Switzerlands highest criminal court to free Polanski.       
	Galli said the justice ministry has submitted a letter to the tribunal explaining why it opposes release even on bail.

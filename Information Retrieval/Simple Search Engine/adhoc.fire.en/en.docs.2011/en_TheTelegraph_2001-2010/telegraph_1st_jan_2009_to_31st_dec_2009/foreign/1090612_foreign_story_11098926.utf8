	London, June 11: Facebooks 200-plus million members will be able to register their own user names to create personalised web addresses on the social networking site.         
	There is expected to be a mad scramble for user names, but only existing Facebook members who had signed up before the announcement will be eligible on Saturday, June 13, to register.         
	Until now, the only part of Facebook which did not reflect users identities was the web address bar. From Saturday June 13, this will all change as Facebook allows its members to register their own user names, making it easier for others to find their profile pages.         
	The new format, already available on Twitter, will allow users the chance to have a personal web address, otherwise known as vanity URLs, such as www.facebook.com/joebloggs. At the moment, addresses typically contain a sequence of numbers. The aim, Facebook says, is to make it easier to find profiles using search engines such as Google.

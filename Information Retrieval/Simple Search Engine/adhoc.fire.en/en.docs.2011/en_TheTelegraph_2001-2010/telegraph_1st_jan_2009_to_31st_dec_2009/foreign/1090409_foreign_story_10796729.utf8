	LAquila (Italy), April 8: Silvio Berlusconi, the Italian Prime Minister, has advised traumatised earthquake survivors to view living in emergency tent accommodation as like being on a camping weekend.         
	An estimated 17,000 people have been made homeless by the powerful earthquake which struck the Abruzzo region of central Italy on Monday, with many of them enduring freezing temperatures in tent cities put up by the army.        
	There are still not enough tents to accommodate all the homeless and some people have spent the last two nights sleeping in their cars, struggling to stay warm in an upland area. Gaffe-prone Berlusconi appeared to dismiss the discomfort, telling German television station N-TV: They have everything they need, they have medical care, hot food. Of course, their current lodgings are a bit temporary. But they should see it like a weekend of camping.

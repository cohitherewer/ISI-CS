	Kabul, Dec. 15 (Reuters): Eight Afghans were killed and dozens wounded by a suicide car bomb today outside a hotel used by foreigners in Kabuls main diplomatic area and across the street from a former vice-presidents home, a security official said.        
	Among the injured were two Indians working for I.. Global that provides Internet services in Kabul. They were identified only as Ajay and Mandal. The Indians, who suffered minor injuries, work as cooks in Globals guest house that was damaged in the blast, external affairs ministry spokesman Vishnu Prakash said in New Delhi.        
	Many Indians stay in the guest house.        
	The blast took place shortly before President Hamid Karzai began speaking at an anti-corruption conference elsewhere in Kabul.        
	The wreckage of the bombers car was in flames outside the gate to the Heetal Hotel in the Wazir Akbar Khan district, sending thick black smoke into the sky.        
	The home of former vice-president, Ahmad Zia Massoud, brother of late anti-Soviet guerrilla leader, Ahmad Shah Massoud, was heavily damaged. A police source said the former vice-president may have been the intended target.        
	A Reuters photographer at the scene saw Massoud being escorted away from his house unharmed, surrounded by the flaming wreckage of the car.         
	Attacks in Kabul have increased over the past year, with militants hitting high-profile targets such as government buildings and guest houses catering for the influx of foreigners working for contractors and aid groups.        
	Last month, Taliban suicide bombers stormed a guest house in a district adjacent to where todays attack took place, killing six UN staff  the militants most audacious attack on foreign civilians since the war started in 2001. The UN responded by withdrawing hundreds of foreigners from Kabul.        
	The fortified Heetal was damaged in todays blast, though not as heavily as nearby houses in the district, home to officials, aid organisations and diplomatic residences.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Tiger chief limousine recovered by army
                                                                                                               Tiger chief limousine recovered by army
                            
	Colombo, April 4 (PTI): Sri Lankan security forces have recovered a damaged, bullet-proof limousine belonging to Tiger supremo Velupillai Prabhakaran in the islands north, as they pushed deeper into the region to capture the remaining rebel pockets.        
	The 58 Division troops, who are engaged in search and clear operations in Puthukudiyiruppu, recovered a damaged bullet-proof limousine confirmed to have been used by Tiger leader Prabhakaran close to a luxury, air-conditioned bungalow inside the 1sqkm terrain surrounded by the security forces on Wednesday, the army said.        
	Earlier this year, the security forces stumbled upon a bullet-proof vehicle in Mullaittivu.        
	The vehicle was recovered along with four more burnt cars close to the luxury house. Security forces recovered the vehicles last evening during the operations conducted in Pudukuduyiruppu.         
	Losing Tiger cadres, having lost all hopes for a last-minute salvation, have vandalised and set ablaze all the five cars, including the chauffeur-driven limousine, believed to have been used by top-rung Tiger leaders, the army said.         
	 The rugged-looking covered pick up wagon, fitted with double steel sheets to escape bullet hits, was found in thick jungles near here as Lankan forces scour the area for the LTTE topmen, a senior defence official told here.        
	It was a crude improvised version of a bullet-proof vehicle, unlike the new technologically advanced bullet-proof cars. It was possibly used by senior LTTE leaders, the official said.         
	The Sri Lankan military feels that as the battle intensified, some of the Tiger leaders including Prabhakaran were believed to have been using such vehicles to coordinate operations and to escape injuries during attack.

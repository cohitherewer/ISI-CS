The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | France probes 10 cases of exploding iPhones
                                                                                                               France probes 10 cases of exploding iPhones
                              Cracking up                            
	Paris, Aug. 27: French authorities have launched an official inquiry into reports of exploding iPhones as at least ten French consumers claiming to have fallen victim to the phenomenon.        
	An 80-year-old pensioner from the Paris suburbs was among the latest group to complain after his iPhone screen cracked up in his hands. A day after a supermarket watchman claimed he was hurt in the eye when his screen suddenly shattered.        
	Other cases involving Apples best-selling device have been reported in the US and Britain, all apparently due to overheated lithium ion batteries.        
	None of the incidents has caused a serious injury but the European Commission has said it is looking into the claims. For its part, Apple insists the exploding screen cases were isolated incidents. The US technology giant, which has sold 26 million iPhones and 200 million iPods to date, said it been informed of the French cases, but would not comment until it had examined the phones.        
	We are aware of these reports and we are waiting to receive the iPhones from the customers. Until we have the full details, we dont have anything further to add, Alan Hely, head of communications at Apple Europe, told the AFP news agency.        
	Frances official consumer affairs watchdog, the DGCCRF, has launched an investigation to find out whether the Apple smartphone could pose a threat to consumers.        
	An investigation is under way. We have been alerted to the problem and we are looking into it closely, a spokesman said on Tuesday.        
	In the latest French incident, Rolland Caufman, a pensioner from the Paris suburb of Noisy-le-Sec, says his iPhone screen broke up on July 21, the week after he bought it.        
	I went out shopping, with my iPhone in my left pocket, when I suddenly felt it heat up and start vibrating  even though I never use the vibrate setting. I took it out of my pocket and held it to my ear  and saw the screen crack up like a car windscreen, he told AFP. Caufman says Apple initially refused to believe him, before finally sending him a free replacement. On Tuesday, 26-year-old security guard Yassine Bouhadi, claimed he was hit in the eye with a glass shard when the screen of his iPhone cracked up. He said he would seek a full refund and file suit for damages. French mobile phone operator Orange said it had been contacted by two customers with shattered iPhone screens, out of 1.2 million iPhones sold.        
	The European Commission has asked all 27 EU nations to keep it informed of any problems, under the communitys rapid alert system for dangerous consumer products, known as RAPEX.

	London, Feb. 18: A temple has been built by monks in northeast Thailand who used over a million recycled beer bottles to make the walls and roof.        
	Wat Pa Maha Chedi Kaew, also known as Wat Lan Kuad or the Temple of a Million Bottles, is in Sisaket province near the Cambodian border, 643km from the capital Bangkok. The Buddhist monks began collecting bottles in 1984 and they collected so many that they decided to use them as a building material.

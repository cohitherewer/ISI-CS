	Tehran, June 26 (Reuters): A hardline Iranian cleric today called for the execution of rioters, in a sign of the authorities determination to stamp out opposition to the June 12 presidential election result.        
	Irans top legislative body, the Guardian Council, said it had found no major violations in the election, which it called the healthiest vote since the 1979 Islamic Revolution.        
	The council had already rejected a call for the annulment of the vote by moderate former Prime Minister Mir Hossein Mousavi, who has led mass protests since he was declared a distant second in the election behind incumbent President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad.        
	I want the judiciary to ... punish leading rioters firmly and without showing any mercy to teach everyone a lesson, Ahmad Khatami told worshippers at Tehran University.        
	Iranian state television said last night eight Basij militiamen were killed by rioters during the protests. State media previously said 20 people were killed in the marches.        
	The Group of Eight foreign ministers, meeting in Italy, said they deplored the post-election violence and called on Iran to settle the crisis soon through democratic dialogue and peaceful means.        
	The crisis should be settled soon through democratic dialogue and peaceful means on the basis of the rule of law, said a final draft statement by the G8 ministers.We call on the Iranian government to guarantee that the will of the Iranian people is reflected in the electoral process.        
	Iranian authorities have accused Mousavi of being responsible for the bloodshed, while the moderate former prime minister says the government is to blame.        
	Khatami, a member of the Assembly of Experts, said the judiciary should charge the leading rioters as beingmohareb or one who wages war against God.        
	They should be punished ruthlessly and savagely, he said. Under Irans Islamic law, punishment for people convicted as mohareb is execution. Mousavis supporters plan to release thousands of balloons with the message: Neda you will always remain in our hearts, in memory of Neda Agha Soltani, the young woman killed last week who has become an icon of the demonstrations.        
	Khatami said Neda was killed by the rioters themselves for propaganda purposes. By watching the film, any wise person can understand that rioters killed her, he said.        
	The Times newspaper quoted Dr Arash Hejazi, an Iranian who appeared on Internet videos helping Neda, as echoing Opposition charges the 26-year-old music student was killed by a government militiaman.        
	She was just a person in the street who was against the injustice going on in her country, and for that she was murdered, he said. Hejazi said that after the protest he left Iran for Britain, where he is a resident, fearing arrest.         
	The authorities have used a combination of warnings, arrests and the threat of police action to drive large demonstrations off Tehrans streets since Saturday with small gatherings dispersed with tear gas.

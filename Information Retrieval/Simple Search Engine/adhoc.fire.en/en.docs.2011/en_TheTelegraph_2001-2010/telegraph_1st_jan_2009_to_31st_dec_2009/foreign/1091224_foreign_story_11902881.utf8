The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Obama to get sports stuff for Christmas
                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      Obama to get sports stuff for Christmas

	Washington, Dec. 23 (AP): President Barack Obama is getting sports stuff for Christmas.        
	But the President, an avid golfer and basketball player, will have to wait until December 25 to find out exactly what it is. First Lady Michelle Obama gave away that hint yesterday during a trip to the Childrens National Medical Center. She visited privately with young patients in the heart and kidney unit, then came downstairs to the atrium to read Twas the Night Before Christmas to dozens more.        
	Daughters Malia, 11, and Sasha, 8, helped their mother deliver that dose of holiday cheer, along with family dog Bo, who sported a red-and-white collar with sleigh bells. They walked him around to meet many of the sick children. A hospital worker followed closely behind offering squirts of anti-bacterial lotion to anyone who had petted Bo.        
	Then came questions from the audience, which included numerous apron-clad hospital volunteers and staffers, and relatives of the children. Dozens of other workers peered down on the scene through windows on the floors above.         
	One child wanted to know what the President would be getting for Christmas.        
	Michelle Obama at first joked that she could not talk about her husbands present because reporters would tell. But she relented and said: Its good. I got him sports stuff.        
	Sasha started to say what she and her sister got him, but the First Lady interrupted. Its something he likes, Sasha said.        
	Earlier yesterday, however, the President said in a radio interview that he and the First Lady decided several years ago not to buy each other presents. He said the only Christmas presents he needs from his daughters are hugs. Another child asked how the holiday will be different for the Obamas.        
	It will be easier to get on the plane, said Sasha, drawing laughs from grown-ups in the audience familiar with the difficulties of commercial air travel. Sasha now travels on Air Force One.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Berlusconi in Bruni gaffe

          NICK SQUIRES                          Berlusconi                                  
	Rome, Feb. 28: Italys gaffe-prone Premier has been caught out joking to French President Nicolas Sarkozy that he gave him his Italian-born wife, Carla Bruni.         
	Silvio Berlusconi, who has a reputation for making off-colour remarks, whispered to Sarkozy in a mixture of French and Italian during a television news conference: Moi, je tai donne la tua donna.        
	The joke was an allusion to the fact that Frances First Lady was born in Italy and her family lived in Turin before moving to Paris in the 1970s because of fears of kidnap by Left-wing terrorists. The former model married Sarkozy a year ago after a whirlwind romance.        
	The remark was delivered as a whisper as the two leaders faced the cameras this week in Rome to discuss the outcome of a summit. Sarkozy was discussing the prospect of greater co-operation between French and Italian diplomats when Berlusconi leant towards him and whispered the remark.        
	It went unnoticed until a French television station, Canal+, employed a lip reader to determine exactly what the Italian media mogul had said.         
	French media crowned Berlusconi the Oscar-winner of vulgarity for the remark, which appeared to make Sarkozy wince.        
	Bruni said last year that she was glad she had become a French citizen, after Berlusconi embarrassed many Italians by twice referring to President-Elect Barack Obama as sun-tanned.

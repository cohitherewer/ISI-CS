The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Netanyahu to be PM again
                                                                                                               Netanyahu to be PM again

	Jerusalem, Feb. 20 (Reuters): Right-wing leader Benjamin Netanyahu today accepted a mandate to form Israels next government and immediately called for a broad, national unity coalition with centrist and Left-wing partners.        
	Netanyahu, 59, who leads the hawkish Likud party, was Prime Minister before in the late 1990s and now has six weeks to put together a coalition for a second turn at the helm. Such a union might create a stable, middle-of-the-road government immune to the sort of pressure from fringe parties that has hamstrung previous administrations.        
	But there was no sign that his rivals would accept, and Netanyahu may have no alternative but an alliance with far-Right and ultra-religious parties, which could tie his hands on making peace with the Palestinians and tightening fiscal discipline.        
	Palestinians and Arab neighbours were likely to see his nomination as confirmation that most Israelis are in no hurry to pursue peace deals with them.        
	Likud more than doubled its seats in the election 10 days ago in which the security of the Jewish state was the paramount issue, after a 2006 conflict with Hezbollah Islamists in Lebanon and a war with Hamas in Gaza last month. But there was no clear winner.        
	With 27 seats in the 120-seat Knesset, Netanyahu ended up one seat behind the centrist Kadima party of Tzipi Livni, the dominant partner in the outgoing coalition.

	Benitos babes    
	 London, Nov. 22 (PTI): Italys fascist dictator Benito Mussolini had 14 lovers at a time, diaries of his mistress have revealed.       
	Claretta Petacci met Mussolini in 1932 at the age of 20, and became his lover four years later. Her diaries cover the period from 1932 to 1938.       
	According to the entries, Petacci was so jealous of the other women in Mussolinis life that she made him call her at least a dozen times a day because she  correctly  suspected him of betraying her.      
	 April 1938, Petacci described their exchange after she caught him having sex with his former girlfriend Alice De Fonseca Pallottelli. All right, I did it. I hadnt seen her since before Christmas. I felt like seeing her; I dont think I committed a crime. I spent 12 minutes with her, he admitted.

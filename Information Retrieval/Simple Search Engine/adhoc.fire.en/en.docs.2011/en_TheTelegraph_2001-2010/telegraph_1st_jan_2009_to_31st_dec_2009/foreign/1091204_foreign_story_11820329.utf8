The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Salahis not to testify at hearing
                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      Salahis not to testify at hearing
          WIL HAYGOOD, JASON HOROWITZ AND MICHAEL D. SHEAR                          Michaele and Tareq Salahi in Washington DC. (AFP)				                                 
	Washington, Dec. 3: The White House tried to put the whole Salahi incident to rest last night.        
	This morning, Bennie Thompson will stir it all up again.        
	Thompson, chairman of the House Committee on Homeland Security, will hold a hearing to get, he says, at the truth of what happened. He hopes to help settle the nerves of a nation rattled by the ease with which an apparently uninvited couple breached layers of security, breezed into the White House and shook President Obamas hand at a state dinner last week.        
	But Thompsons hearing is also making White House officials nervous.        
	They have refused to make social secretary Desire Rogers available for the inquiry and, with a memo acknowledging that administration staff had contributed to the security breach, they have sought to put an end to the matter and make the hearings old news by the time they start.        
	Now it is up to Thompson to decide how important his inquiry is.        
	After Tareq and Michaele Salahi declined an invitation to testify before the committee about their unexpected appearance at the White House, the Mississippi Democrat warned in a statement last night that he would subpoena them to compel their appearance if necessary.        
	I mean, they walked in right off the street! Thompson said in an earlier interview in his spacious Capitol Hill office. Thompson was quick to point out that he has heard concern from as many whites as blacks about the Presidents safety. But as the first African-American to chair the committee, he said he has sensed heightened concern among blacks who already feared for the Presidents safety given the historic nature of his position and the countrys racially charged past.        
	Joe Madisons been all over the story, Thompson said of the popular radio host.        
	Ive personally heard this worry, said Thompson, whose committee was created in the aftermath of the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks upon the US.        
	Agents suspended        
	The Secret Service agents who admitted the Salahis through a White House checkpoint at last weeks dinner have been placed on administrative leave and could lose their jobs, the director of the agency told a Congressional committee today.        
	At a hearing of the House Homeland Security Committee, Secret Service chief Mark Sullivan took full responsibility for the November 24 security failure, saying this is our fault and our fault alone.

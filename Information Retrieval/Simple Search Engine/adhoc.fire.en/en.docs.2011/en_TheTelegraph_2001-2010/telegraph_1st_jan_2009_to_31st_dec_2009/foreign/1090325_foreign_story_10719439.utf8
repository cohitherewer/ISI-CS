	Memory man    
	 London, March 24: Bob Petrella, a television producer, can recall almost everything hes ever done since the age of five, reports The Daily Telegraph.       
	The 58-year-old from Los Angeles remembers up to half the days of his own life in shockingly vivid detail. It was only when he put himself forward for a study about memory taking place at the University of California last year, that Bobs remarkable abilities became known to scientists.      
	He was diagnosed with a condition called hyperthymestia, meaning overdeveloped memory, sometimes dubbed as Super Autobiographical Memory, which has been discovered in just four people around the globe.      
	Petrella recalls the day and date he first met a good friend, and all the conversations hes had on most days throughout the last 53 years. He first discovered his amazing talent at primary school, when he could pass every test easily without even revising.     
	UFO claim    
	 London: A group of UFOs spotted hovering over London may have been a laser light show, locals claim, reports The Daily Telegraph. Derek Burdon was left stunned when he took a scenic picture of London then noticed four flying saucers on the far right of the picture. Burdon took the photographs 16 floors up on the roof top of Orion House in Covent Garden. The 40-year-old said: I have not tampered with it. It was taken on my mobile and I guess I am just lucky to have it.

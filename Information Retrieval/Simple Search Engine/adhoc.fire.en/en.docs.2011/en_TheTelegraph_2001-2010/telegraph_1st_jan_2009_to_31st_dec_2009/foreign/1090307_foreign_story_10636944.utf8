The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | US Iran test
                                                                                                               US Iran test
                            
	Washington, March 6 (Reuters): US secretary of state Hillary Clinton said today that the Obama administration was testing the waters in its diplomatic overtures to Iran and Syria this week.        
	Yesterday, Clinton said she planned to invite Iran to an international conference on Afghanistan, likely to happen later this month, and two senior US officials will be in Syria this weekend as part of the new American strategy to speak to its enemies, a shift from the Bush administration.        
	We have a sense of urgency in the Obama administration. We believe that there are a lot of challenges and threats that we have inherited that we have to address but there are lots of opportunities, Clinton told National Public Radio.        
	We are being extremely vigorous in our outreach because we are testing the waters. We are determining what is possible. We are turning new pages and resetting buttons and doing all kinds of efforts to create more partners and fewer adversaries, she added in the interview.        
	Clinton said final details of the venue and timing of the Afghanistan conference had not been set yet but countries with an interest in stabilising Afghanistan would be invited, including Iran.

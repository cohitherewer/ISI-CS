Taliban militants attacked Pakistani forces and recaptured a strategic town today, officials said.                   A senior Iranian Revolutionary Guards commander today said his force should be given permission to hunt down terrorists inside Pakistan, state television reported                             US Senator Kerry with President Karzai in Kabul on Tuesday.

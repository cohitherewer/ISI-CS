	Long Beach (California), Feb. 6 (AP): Bill Gates released a jar of mosquitoes onstage at a technology conference to make a point about malaria prevention.        
	Theres no reason only poor people should have the experience, the billionaire co-founder of Microsoft said at a technology conference in Long Beach. Audience members laughed nervously as the insects swarmed across the auditorium. Gates assured them that the bugs were not carrying malaria.

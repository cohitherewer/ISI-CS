	Peshawar, Nov. 4: It has been a week since the bomb exploded at the womens market here, but people still talk about the images of its aftermath: womens bodies, naked and broken. A hand with hennaed nails. An arm still wearing bracelets.        
	Even for Peshawar, a city that has long been pummelled by violent attacks, the bombing in the Meena market last week felt different. The violence was aimed not at soldiers or the police, but at societys most vulnerable members  poor women and children, who made up about half of the bombings 114 victims.        
	In two days of interviews, Pakistanis here said they believed the war had taken a dark new turn, with civilians now bearing the brunt of insurgents fury. But that does not mean greater public anger at the Taliban. The attack was so disturbing that people refused to believe that their countrymen were the culprits. If anything, it was met with disbelief or anger at the government for failing to protect civilians.        
	The Taliban talk about morality and womens dress, but they wouldnt do such a thing to us, said Muhamed Orenzeib Khan, a petrol station attendant who lost nine members of his family in the blast. Their target was never the common people. The brutality of the bombing and peoples reaction show just how complicated Pakistans militancy problem has become. The military is now in the third week of a campaign against the Taliban, and though it has widespread public support, there is still a great reluctance to accept that Pakistanis or fellow Muslims are the ones doing the killing.

	London, Oct. 8: Whatever has been voted the most annoying word in American English.        
	The comment, popularised by sullen teens, was judged more grating than anyway and less tolerable than phrases including it is what it is and you know. Nearly 50 per cent of people questioned said whatever was the word that bothered them the most.                     THE DAILY TELEGRAPH

	Trousers trouble    
	 London, April 12: It was less a case of the wrong trousers and more a case of none at all for Bryn Terfel, the world-renowned opera singer, at a recent concert.       
	Before leaving his hotel to perform on a warm day in Seoul, the capital of South Korea, the Welsh bass-baritone opted to wear a pair of shorts. But, his mind no doubt on the performance ahead, he unfortunately forgot to pack his trousers, reports The Sunday Telegraph.       
	Arriving at the venue with only minutes before he was due on stage there was no time to return to the hotel, and Terfel was left with the prospect of singing in his shorts.       
	However, fortune smiled on the singer. When he appealed for help one good-natured Korean opera lover agreed to the odd request of equipping 6ft 4 ins Terfel with an alternative pair.

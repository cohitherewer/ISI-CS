	Islamabad, June 10 (PTI): Footage captured by close circuit cameras minutes before the suicide attack on a luxury hotel in Peshawar shows terrorists storming the buildings compound after firing at the guards.        
	The attackers, who drove up to the Pearl Continentals gates in a white car and a small truck shortly before 10.30pm last night, opened fire after the guards opened the gate and lowered a concrete barrier.         
	The car and the truck then raced towards the parking lot of the hotel. The footage, aired by Geo News channel, showed a flash followed by a massive explosion minutes later and plumes of smoke rising into the air.         
	Police officials said at least five terrorists were involved in the attack. About 500kg of explosives in the truck was detonated by a suicide bomber, they added. A section of the hotel collapsed after the blast.         
	Seventeen people were killed and over 50 injured in the bombing. It is the latest in a series of attacks carried out by militants in retaliation for military operations against the Taliban in the Swat Valley.         
	Bashir Ahmed Bilour, a senior minister in the North West Frontier Province government, did not rule out the possibility of an employee of the Pearl Continental being involved in the attack.         
	Unless a person from the hotel was involved, it would not be possible for a vehicle (with explosives) to enter the compound. Despite security arrangements, a vehicle with 500kg of explosives entered the area, Bilour said in Peshawar.         
	He said such attacks cannot be prevented at a time when the NWFP was in a state of war. Bilour said the provincial government will not be cowed down.        
	We will fight to the last breath and we are confident that we will rid the country of terrorists, the minister said.

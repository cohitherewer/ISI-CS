	Washington, Dec. 28: Backtracking from a widely criticised assertion over the weekend, homeland security secretary Janet Napolitano said in a televised interview today that the thwarted bombing of a Detroit-bound airliner on Christmas Day represented a failure of the nations aviation security system, not a success.        
	Napolitano said on the Today programme on NBC that her remark yesterday that the system worked had been taken out of context. Our system did not work in this instance, she said. No one is happy or satisfied with that. An extensive review is under way.        
	Obama administration officials scrambled over the weekend to portray the episode, in which passengers and flight attendants subdued Abdulmutallab and doused the fire he had started, as a test that the air safety system passed.        
	The system has worked really very, very smoothly over the course of the past several days, Napolitano said in an interview on This Week on ABC. Robert Gibbs, the White House spokesman, used nearly the same language on Face the Nation on CBS.        
	But counterterrorism experts and members of Congress were hardly willing to praise what they said was a security system that had proved to be not nimble enough to respond to the ever-creative techniques devised by would-be terrorists.        
	The fact that Abdulmutallab had been banned from entering Britain appeared to raise fresh questions about one of the most pressing issues raised by the attempted attack  the efficacy of systems in place on both sides of the Atlantic for guarding against terrorists planning attacks on airliners.

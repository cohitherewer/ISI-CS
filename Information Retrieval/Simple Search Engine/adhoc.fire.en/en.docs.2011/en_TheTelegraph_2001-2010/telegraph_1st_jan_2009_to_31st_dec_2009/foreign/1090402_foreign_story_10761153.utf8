	Laugh to bed    
	 London, April 1: A new study shows that women think funny men are smarter and more likely to be honest than more dour counterparts.       
	Although studies have shown that humour is not linked to intelligence, researchers believe that the findings can be the reason why so many lonely heart ads placed by women list GSOH (good sense of humour) as a prerequisite for a partner.       
	The findings provide evidence that women use humour as an indication of a guys intelligence.       
	Kristofor McCarty, from Northumbria University, who led the study, said: Intelligence is a very attractive quality as a clever man should be more able to provide resources for his offspring.    
	Putin dog    
	 Novo-Ogaryovo, Russia (Reuters): Prime Minister Vladimir Putins pet dog gobbled up a special tea prepared for Russias ruling party bosses on Wednesday.      
	While Putin discussed ways to help the local food industry, his favourite black Labrador Koni slinked into a room at his residence and tucked into delicacies prepared for leaders of his United Russia party.      
	Koni ate everything, said one of Putins astounded bodyguards.      
	Putins spokesperson said Koni, who has the run of Putins Novo-Ogaryovo residence outside Moscow, had eaten some pastries, biscuits and jellied desserts.

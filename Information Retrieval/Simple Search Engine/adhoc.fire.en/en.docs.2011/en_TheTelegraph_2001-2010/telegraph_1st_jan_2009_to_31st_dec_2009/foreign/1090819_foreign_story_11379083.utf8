	Britney dumped    
	 Los Angeles, Aug. 18 (PTI): Popstar Britney Spears has been reportedly dumped by her boyfriend, agent Jason Trawick because of her constant appeals for marriage.       
	Spears, who has two unsuccessful marriages behind her, had been pestering Trawick to marry her, saying that she wanted more children. This resulted in Trawick breaking off relations with the singer.      
	It was just too fast, too soon for Jason. He didnt like the pressure Britney and her family were putting on him to put a ring on her finger.

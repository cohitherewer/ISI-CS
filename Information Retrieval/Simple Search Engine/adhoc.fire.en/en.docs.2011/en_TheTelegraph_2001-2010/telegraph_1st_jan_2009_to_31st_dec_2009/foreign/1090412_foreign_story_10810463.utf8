The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Woman lived 12 years with bullet in face
                                                                                                               Woman lived 12 years with bullet in face
                            
	Tirana, April 11 (Reuters): An Albanian woman went around for 12 years with a bullet lodged below her cheekbone without her noticing it, the woman said yesterday.        
	Mrike Rrucaj told Reuters she was shot in her sleep in 1997 at a time when the Balkan country was plagued by anarchy and chaos amid protests against fraudulent pyramid schemes, but a doctor said the bullet had passed through her.         
	I was covered in blood and I thought I had been killed, Rrucaj said of the incident in 1997.         
	The doctor at the hospital said the bullet had gone in and come out. I was 28, and did not feel a thing for 12 years.

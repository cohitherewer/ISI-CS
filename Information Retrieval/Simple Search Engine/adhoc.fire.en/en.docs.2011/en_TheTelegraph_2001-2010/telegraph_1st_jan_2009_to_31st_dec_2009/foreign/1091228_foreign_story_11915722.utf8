	Brangelina     
	 London (PTI): Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt were in a giving mood at Christmas, handing over $100,000 to the SOS Childrens Villages charity in the US. The organisation is a foster care facility, which enables siblings to stay together during adoption, Contactmusic reported. In this holiday season, many of us take for granted that we are surrounded by loving family. The poor outcomes for foster children indicate that we must do a much better job of supporting them, Pitt said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Harvard race row hits Obama nerve
                                                                                                               Harvard race row hits Obama nerve
          KATHARINE Q. SEELYE                            Obama, Gates                                 
	Washington, July 23: Americans got a rare glimpse last night of what it means to have a black President in the Oval Office.        
	In response to a question at his prime-time news conference about the arrest of Henry Louis Gates Jr, the black Harvard professor, in his own home over the weekend, Obama declared that the Cambridge, Massachusetts, police had acted stupidly.        
	Obamas response was his most animated performance of the hour-long news conference, and represented an extraordinary plunge by a President into a local law-enforcement dispute.         
	It opened a window into a world from which Obama is now largely shielded, suggesting the incident had struck a raw nerve with the President.        
	In the public spotlight, Obama has sought to transcend, if not avoid, the issue of race.         
	Last nights news conference seemed to be a different deal as the President leaped into a highly charged controversy. Obama, asked yesterday what the incident said about race relations in America, noted up front that Gates is a friend and that his comments might be biased.         
	He said words had been exchanged and added: Now, I dont know, not having been there and not seeing all the facts, what role race played in that, but I think its fair to say, number one, any of us would be pretty angry; number two, that the Cambridge police acted stupidly in arresting somebody when there was already proof that they were in their own home; and, number three, what I think we know, separate and apart from this incident, is that there is a long history in this country of African-Americans and Latinos being stopped by law enforcement disproportionately.        
	He also used biting humour, grinning broadly as he imagined being in Gatess seemingly preposterous circumstance of being arrested after trying to get into his own home. Here, Id get shot, Obama said, referring to his new address of 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue.

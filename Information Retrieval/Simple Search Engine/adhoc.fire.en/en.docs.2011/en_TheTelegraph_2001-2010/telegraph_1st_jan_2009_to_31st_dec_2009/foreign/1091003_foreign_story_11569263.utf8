                                                                                                               Passengers asked to pee before boarding

	London, Oct. 2: A Japanese airline, All Nippon Airways, has started asking its passengers to visit the lavatory before boarding in an attempt to reduce carbon emissions.        
	The airline will position staff near the boarding gates in terminals to ask passengers waiting for their flight to relieve themselves before boarding the aircraft.        
	It hopes that the weight saved will lead to a five-tonne reduction in carbon emissions over the course of a month.        
	According to Japans NHK television, the airline started the unusual policy on Wednesday.         
	Initially intended as an experiment lasting one month and 42 flights, ANA says that it may expand the trial if results are positive and it is well received by passengers.        
	Flying is the fastest-growing source of carbon dioxide emissions, accounting for more than 600 million tons of the greenhouse gas per year.        
	A return flight between Heathrow and New Yorks John F Kennedy airport creates around 1.35 tons of CO2 per passenger  more than one-third the yearly emissions of an average person worldwide.

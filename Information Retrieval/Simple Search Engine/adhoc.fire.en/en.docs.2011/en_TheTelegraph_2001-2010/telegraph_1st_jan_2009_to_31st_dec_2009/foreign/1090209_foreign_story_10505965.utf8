          BEN LEACH                              (Top) A Staffordshire bull terrier; (above) a Jack Russel (the breeds that killed the baby)				                                 
	London, Feb. 8: A three- month-old boy has died after being viciously attacked by two family dogs  one of them named Tyson  while in the care of his grandmother.         
	Police said the exact cause of death had yet to be confirmed but it is suspected that Jaden Mack was killed during an attack by the grandmothers Staffordshire bull terrier and Jack Russell.         
	It is understood that the baby was asleep in a basket on the ground floor of the house when the dogs attacked.         
	Neighbours reported hearing screams of panic as Denise Wilson, the babys grandmother ran into the street crying for help. Friends rushed into the house to help and were forced to drag the dogs off the child who was bleeding severely from the attack.         
	The tragedy occurred in the early hours of Saturday in the town of Ystrad Mynach.         
	The child was taken to hospital where he was later pronounced dead. The grandmother was also taken to hospital where she was treated for shock but was later released.         
	The police confirmed that they intend to question the grandmother.         
	Alexandra and Christopher Mack, the boys parents, went out on Friday night and took the child to stay with his grandmother, who is the owner of the two dogs. Neighbours confirmed that it was a regular arrangement and that the baby had stayed at the house several times before.         
	Heather Organ, 47, said she was watching television when she heard screaming. It seemed as if somebody was very distressed or being attacked, she said. I came out and saw my neighbour and he knocked on the door and asked her to open the door.         
	When the door opened, two dogs ran out. At the time I didnt realise what had happened so, rather than let the dogs get hurt, I picked up the Jack Russell and ushered the other one (Staffordshire bull terrier) off the road.         
	The grandmother came out and she was screaming The baby is dead. He is dead. There was no blood on the Jack Russell but with the black one (Staffordshire bull terrier) I couldnt tell.         
	When I entered the room the baby was obviously dead. The baby had a severe injury to his neck and with that the police arrived.         
	She added: It was dreadful. There was blood on the floor. I know people cant prove anything but at this point in time it does suggest that it was the dog.         
	Another neighbour, Gail Jones, 45, said she was walking back from a night out when she heard a distressed woman. It was just after 12am and I heard the grandmother. She was absolutely hysterical.         
	I know one neighbour tried to give the baby the kiss of life so you can imagine what state he is in now. Your heart goes out to the family.         
	Marion Harding, who lives two doors away, said: It was just gone midnight when I heard hysterical screams in the street. Other neighbours went to find out what was happening and found the baby was being attacked by two dogs.         
	Other neighbours said the Staffordshire bull terrier called Tyson  after World Heavyweight boxing champion Mike Tyson  was normally docile and there had been no previous trouble with it. The Jack Russell involved in the attack was a brown and white terrier called Lucy.         
	One neighbour said: Dogs can get jealous  it may be something to do with the grandmother making a fuss of the baby.         
	A police spokesperson said: Although the exact cause of death has yet to be established, and a post-mortem is taking place this afternoon, it is believed the fatal injuries were caused by the family dogs.         
	The dogs have been removed from the property and are currently being held at a local vets.                    THE SUNDAY TELEGRAPH

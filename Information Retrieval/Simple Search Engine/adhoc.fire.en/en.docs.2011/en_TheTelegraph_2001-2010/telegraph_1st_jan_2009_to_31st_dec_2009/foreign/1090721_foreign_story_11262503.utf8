The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | One step was plenty, says Armstrong
                                                                                                               One step was plenty, says Armstrong
          PAUL FARHI                          Armstrong: His own man                                      
	Washington, July 20: Forty years ago today, Neil Armstrong became the most famous man on the planet by taking a short walk off of it. Since then he has tried to live with that fact, and also live it down.         
	Only rarely  on major anniversary dates, like today  does he show up on television, and then only fleetingly. He has not leveraged his fame for higher office or some grand cause, nor has he sold it willy-nilly.         
	If the subject is Neil Armstrong, the first man to set foot on the moon tends to turn churlish. He will defer, deflect or refuse to answer. When his little home town of Wapakoneta, Ohio, sought to honour him with a parade on the 25th anniversary of his moonwalk, Armstrong sent his regrets. He once pleaded to a newspaper reporter, 10 years after his feat: How long must it take before I can cease to be known as a spaceman?         
	As if such a thing were possible. Or even desirable.         
	Its not fair to call Armstrong a recluse, as many accounts of his life after Apollo 11 invariably have. He is no cosmic J.D. Salinger or Howard Hughes, shunning the world out of spite or madness. Armstrong makes the occasional public appearance and speech, as he did yesterday at the Smithsonian Air and Space Museum in Washington DC, and as he will do again at Nasas official commemoration of the moon landing. He has also appeared in two Nasa video productions over the past five years.

	Whats more, after resisting would-be biographers for years, he finally caved in to his familys prodding and sat for more than 50 hours of interviews with Auburn University historian James R. Hansen for a 2005 biography, First Man: The Life of Neil A. Armstrong.        
	Yet for the 40th anniversary, Armstrong has once again carefully rationed himself. He told planners at the Smithsonian and Nasa that he would speak at their events, but not as the keynoter, not at length and only in conjunction with other Apollo alumni. A book-signing at the Air and Space Museum featuring his Apollo 11 crew mates, Buzz Aldrin and Michael Collins, was out of the question (Armstrong stopped signing anything some years ago when brokers began peddling bogus signatures on the Internet). Media interviews? Not a chance. Hes always been this way, says one person involved in planning the events.         
	Carol Armstrong says her husband averages about 10 interview requests per month. He turns them all down, usually without reply (he did not respond to a request for this article).         
	I think he thinks its all been said before, Carol says from their home near Cincinnati. A decade ago, when The Post sought an interview, Armstrong emailed his regrets, adding with Garbo-like brevity: I am comfortable with my level of public discourse.        
	Those who know Armstrong say his behaviour has been consistent over the arc of his 78 years. Even before the world insisted on lionising him, he was his own man, faithful to his standards: reject personal glory. Avoid focusing on the self. Keep whats private private.         
	Until Hansen revealed it, some of Armstrongs closest working associates never knew that Armstrong and his first wife, Janet, had a two-year-old daughter who died of a brain tumour a few years before Armstrong went into space.         
	Neil has a very strict sense of whats appropriate to be involved in, and has since he was a boy, says Hansen, a former Nasa historian who spent nearly three years corresponding with Armstrong before winning his cooperation on the book. Armstrong has such a hard time speaking about himself in the first person, Hansen says, that he felt he couldnt write an autobiography or a memoir.              
	Adds Hansen: quot;Neil was very much the same person after Apollo 11 as he was before it. The         
	pragmatism, the modesty, the shyness were there from an early age. I dont see any radical         
	changes in (him) throughout his life. quot;               
	In his limited public utterances, Armstrong has always turned the subject away from         
	himself. He usually deflects credit to the 400,000 people who built and maintained the         
	vehicles and managed the bureaucracy that enabled him and Aldrin to reach the moon.               
	* * *               
	In his own book, quot;Men From Earth, quot; Aldrin wrote that he thought the man who preceded him         
	onto the lunar surface had worked his way through his career quot;carefully watching         
	everything he did and said.               
	Talkative and opinionated, Aldrin may be the anti-Armstrong. In his post-Apollo career,         
	Aldrin has done what Armstrong would find inconceivable. He once did a guest voice on quot;The         
	Simpsons, quot; sat for a hilarious interview on quot;Da Ali G Show, quot; made a rap video with Snoop         
	Dogg and Quincy Jones, and loaned his name to a computer game, Buzz Aldrins Race Into         
	Space. Just in time for the 40th anniversary of the moon landing, theres Aldrin in an ad         
	for -- what?! -- Louis Vuitton luggage. Aldrin once punched a guy who accused him of         
	 quot;lying quot; about the moon landing.               
	Someone once described Aldrin and Armstrong as quot;amiable strangers, quot; but Hansen says thats         
	inaccurate. quot;Im not even sure amiable is the right word. Neil did not appreciate how         
	(Aldrin) went off in such strong, aggressive ways with his ideas. They worked well         
	together, but Im not sure there was much personal rapport. Buzz never figured Neil out. quot;         
	From time to time, Hansen says, Aldrin would contact him and ask for help to persuade         
	Armstrong to attend some event -- a reflection, Hansen says, of the astronauts uneasy         
	relationship.               
	Hansen says Armstrongs reticence may have been reinforced by the example of Charles         
	Lindbergh, another 20th-century pioneer who knew much about the soul-twisting powers of         
	fame. The two men met in 1968, and Lindbergh and his wife, Anne Morrow Lindbergh, were         
	Armstrongs guests for the Apollo 11 launch. They corresponded until Charles Lindberghs         
	death in 1974.               
	A solitary country boy who dreamed of flying, Armstrong grew into a skilled Navy combat         
	pilot (he flew 78 missions in the Korean War), an engineer and a test pilot who flew the         
	experimental X-15 rocket plane to the edge of outer space. As a pilot and astronaut, his         
	unflappable calm was more than a personality trait; it was a survival skill. On his first         
	space mission, in 1966, Armstrong docked Gemini 8 with a second vehicle, but the craft         
	immediately fell into a continuous, stomach-churning roll. Armstrong fired the vehicles         
	reentry controls, aborting the mission but saving the spacecraft, himself and pilot David         
	Scott.               
	As Tom Wolfe described him in quot;The Right Stuff, quot; Armstrongs facial expression quot;hardly         
	ever changed. Youd ask him a question, and he would just stare at you with those         
	pale-blue eyes of his, and youd start to ask the question again, figuring he hadnt         
	understood, and -- click -- out of his mouth would come forth a sequence of long, quiet,         
	perfectly formed, precisely thought-out sentences, full of anisotropic functions and         
	multiple-encounter trajectories. . . . It was as if his hesitations were just data         
	punch-in intervals for his computer.               
	It may have been Armstrongs wary, cautious personality that prompted NASAs brass to         
	choose him instead of Aldrin as the first man to step out of the lunar landing vehicle.               
	NASAs official explanation was that Armstrong, the missions commander, would be seated         
	closest to the hatch in the cramped landing vehicle and would have to emerge first. But         
	that was largely a smoke screen designed to mollify Aldrin, who had campaigned for the         
	honor. According to Hansens research, the order was actually determined at a secret         
	meeting, in March 1969, of the Apollo programs four senior administrators -- flight-crew         
	director Deke Slayton, Apollo program manager George Low, director of flight operations         
	Chris Kraft and Manned Spacecraft Center director Robert Gilruth.               
	The four men concluded that Armstrong, not Aldrin, had the temperament best suited to be,         
	as Kraft later put it, quot;a legend, an American hero beyond Lucky Lindbergh, beyond any         
	soldier or politician or inventor. quot;               
	 quot;Neil was Neil, quot; Kraft told Hansen. quot;Calm, quiet and absolute confidence. We all knew that         
	he was the Lindbergh type. He had no ego. . . . If you would have said to him, You are         
	going to be the most famous human being on Earth for the rest of your life, he would have         
	answered, Then I dont want to be the first man on the Moon. quot;               
	The decision was crushing for Aldrin, who for a time in the 1970s suffered from depression         
	and fought to overcome alcoholism.               
	Armstrong, meanwhile, battled his enormous celebrity with characteristic stoicism in         
	public, but with deep private misgivings. Upon returning to Earth, he was feted for months         
	around the world, then settled into a desk job at NASA. Within two years he was gone,         
	annoyed by the constant demands for photo ops and meet-and-greets.               
	 quot;Its not that I feel uncomfortable, quot; he said shortly after leaving NASA. quot;Its just that         
	I find theres inadequate time to do all the things Id like to be doing. He paused,         
	noting with gross understatement, quot;There has been a drastic change to my life.                     
	He retreated to Ohio and became an aerospace engineering professor at the University of         
	Cincinnati, where he taught throughout the 1970s. This period was quieter, but not without         
	its pressures, too. Campus security had to keep a close eye on outsiders who came to the         
	school hoping to catch a glimpse of him. He had a hard time simply eating in public; one         
	colleague recalled in 1999 that Armstrong would interrupt his meals and retreat to his car         
	if he spotted autograph-seekers.               
	Perhaps Armstrongs most uncharacteristic act came in 1979. As his university career wound         
	down, he decided to appear in a series of ads for Chrysler, a company that was then, as         
	now, struggling for its survival. The ads are dimly remembered today, but for Armstrong         
	they marked the beginning of his most financially rewarding period.               
	He eventually did endorsements for General Time and the Bankers Association of America,         
	and slowly prospered by accepting appointments to the boards of corporations that, Hansen         
	says, Armstrong could justify on the basis of offering engineering advice. The list         
	included companies such as Learjet, Taft Broadcasting, United Airlines, Marathon Oil and         
	Morton-Thiokol. The latter company manufactured the rocket boosters that exploded in the         
	1986 Challenger space shuttle accident. (Armstrong joined Thiokol two years after serving         
	on the federal commission that investigated the disaster.)               
	Armstrong is retired now, and he and his wife -- he divorced and remarried in 1994 --         
	spend most of their time at leisure, playing golf, traveling, skiing in Colorado during         
	the winter.               
	In reflection, Armstrong has confided in colleagues that he never wanted to be defined by         
	Apollo 11, and by the few hours he spent walking in moondust. Though he is wary of         
	offending NASA, he said as much publicly, in a rare TV appearance in 2005, to promote         
	Hansens book on quot;60 Minutes quot;: quot;Wed all like to be recognized not for one piece of         
	fireworks, but for the ledger of our daily work. quot;               
	This seems understandable as a personal matter, but odd -- and impossible -- as a matter         
	of history. The first man on the moon doesnt feel his life is defined by being the first         
	man on the moon? As if the world would remember much more than Armstrongs quot;one piece of         
	fireworks quot;? Would his name belong beside Magellans or Marco Polos if not for Armstrongs         
	singular achievement?               
	Hansen cant help agreeing with those who believe Armstrong could have been a more         
	forceful advocate for space exploration, that his reserve was damning. By being reticent         
	he created mystery, and hence a vacuum that was filled with quot;craziness quot; -- such as a         
	long-standing rumor in the Muslim world that Armstrong converted to Islam after hearing         
	the call to prayer on the moon. Not true. But quot;because of Neils personality, hes his own         
	worst enemy, quot; Hansen says. quot;People want to project all kinds of things on him. quot;               
	Enigmas can be like that.               
	The other view is that Armstrong was as heroic after his return to Earth as he was on his         
	journey beyond it. In a culture that crushes and disfigures the famous, Armstrong was         
	Olympian in his discipline and humility, never tarnishing the grand moment that fate         
	handed him. The ultimate professional, he did what was asked of him, and then went home,         
	spurning the laurels.               
	Indeed, maybe Armstrong knows more than anyone alive about fame and its limitations, that         
	it is cheap, wearying and filled with constant, jangling pressures. What kind of ego         
	requires that?               
	And who needs it -- especially if, like Neil Armstrong, your legacy will never be         
	challenged and your name will live on long after you have departed this Earth?

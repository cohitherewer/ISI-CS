	Barnstable (Massachusetts), Aug. 8: Eunice Kennedy Shriver, a sister of President John F. Kennedy and a longtime champion for the disabled, was in a Massachusetts hospital with family at her side.        
	The 88-year-old Shriver, who has been weakened in recent years by a series of strokes, was in critical condition yesterday.        
	Her husband, 1972 vice-presidential candidate and former Peace Corps director R. Sargent Shriver, was at her side along with their children and grandchildren at Cape Cod Hospital in Barnstable, said family spokesman Stephen Rivers. California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger, the husband of Shrivers daughter, Maria, was also there.

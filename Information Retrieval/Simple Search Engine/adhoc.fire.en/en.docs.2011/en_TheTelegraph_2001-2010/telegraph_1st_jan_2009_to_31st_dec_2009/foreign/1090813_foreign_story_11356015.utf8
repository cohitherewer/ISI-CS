                                                                                                               Militant clashes kill 70: Pak
                            
	Dera Ismail Khan (Pakistan), Aug. 12 (AP): Fierce clashes between Taliban fighters and those loyal to a pro-government warlord killed at least 70 people today, intelligence officials said.        
	The violence comes a week after a CIA drone reportedly killed the top Taliban leader in Pakistan, Baitullah Mehsud.        
	The clashes pitched Taliban militants against followers of tribal warlord Turkistan Bitani on the fringes of the South Waziristan border region, where US and Pakistani officials believe Mehsud died in a missile strike last Wednesday.        
	Pakistans army sent helicopter gunships as reinforcements to pound about 300 Taliban fighters attacking Bitanis mountain stronghold, two intelligence officials said. The fighting raged for five hours.

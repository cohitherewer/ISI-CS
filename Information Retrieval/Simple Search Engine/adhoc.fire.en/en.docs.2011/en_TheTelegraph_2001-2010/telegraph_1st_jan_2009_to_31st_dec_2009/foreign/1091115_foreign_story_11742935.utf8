	Peshawar, Nov. 14 (Reuters): A suicide attacker set off a car bomb at a police checkpoint in Peshawar today, killing 10 people, officials said.        
	The city, near the Afghan border, has been bombed several times since the army began an offensive against the Taliban in South Waziristan last month. Militants have hit back by stepping up attacks on towns and cities, killing several hundred people.        
	The car bomber approached a barrier near the police check post and then it exploded, city official Sahibzada Anis said. Ten people were killed and more than 20 wounded, he said. Police said two of their men were among the dead.        
	Pieces of the bombers car littered the road. Several other vehicles were badly damaged, with one flipped onto its roof. There was no immediate claim of responsibility for the blast.         
	Yesterday, a suicide car bomb exploded at an office of Pakistans main intelligence agency in Peshawar, killing 17 people. The Taliban said it carried out that attack, as well as a suicide bombing at a police station in the northwestern town of Bannu yesterday, in which seven people were killed.        
	We will carry out similar attacks in other parts of the country, Qari Hussain Mehsud, a senior Pakistani Taliban member and a cousin of Taliban chief Hakimullah Mehsud, said by telephone.

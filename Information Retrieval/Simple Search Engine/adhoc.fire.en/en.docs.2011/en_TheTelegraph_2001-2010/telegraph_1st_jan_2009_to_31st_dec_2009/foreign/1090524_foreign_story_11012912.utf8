The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Ban tours Lanka war camp
                                                                                                               Ban tours Lanka war camp
                            
	Manik Farm (Sri Lanka), May 23 (Reuters): UN secretary-general Ban Ki-moon toured Sri Lankas largest war refugee camp today during a trip to press for wider humanitarian access and political reconciliation.        
	In the highest-level international visit to Sri Lanka since the government declared victory on Monday over the Tamil Tiger rebels in a 25-year war, Ban later flew over the final battleground.        
	Ban said he would encourage open political discussions between the majority Sinhalese and minorities including Tamils when he meets Rajapaksa later in Kandy.        
	I hope that President Rajapaksa and government leaders will reach out with inclusive dialogue with the minority groups, Ban said.

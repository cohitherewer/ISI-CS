The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Border alert to depleted force
                                                                                                               Border alert to depleted force
          NISHIT DHOLABHAI                              
	New Delhi, May 4: The Nepal crisis has led the Indian government to put the Sashastra Seema Bal on high alert, but the border force is a depleted one because of deployment in elections.        
	Out of the SSBs 41 battalions, some half a dozen are on poll duty.         
	Even as these personnel move from Chhattisgarh to Uttar Pradesh and onwards to Haryana, the churning in Nepal has increased the importance of tighter vigil on the sensitive Nepal border.        
	We are expected to be extra watchful along the border in Uttar Pradesh and Bihar for possible infiltration, an SSB officer said.        
	The 1751km border with Nepal can well be termed a virtual border. There is no fencing and, especially in areas contiguous with the Madhes plains of Nepal, people cross over at will.        
	Home ministry sources said the 33 SSB companies on poll duty would not be recalled, but some personnel from the Bhutan border could be shifted to the Nepal border.         
	The SSB guards the Nepal and Bhutan borders.        
	Home secretary Madhukar Gupta, who has been in touch with SSB director-general Gopal Sharma since yesterday, met senior border management officials today.         
	Over the past few weeks, the security forces have had suspicions about infiltration by Nepalese Maoists. Some in the security establishment are also prepared to link the Nepal Maoists with the Naxalites of India who are keeping several state governments sleepless.

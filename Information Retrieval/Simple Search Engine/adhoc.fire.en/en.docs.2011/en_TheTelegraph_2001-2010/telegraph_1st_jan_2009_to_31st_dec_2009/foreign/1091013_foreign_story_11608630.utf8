The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Koirala kin elevated to deputy PM
                                                                                                               Koirala kin elevated to deputy PM

	Kathmandu, Oct. 12: In an obvious bid to save his chair Prime Minister Madhav Kumar Nepal today grudgingly elevated his controversial foreign minister and Nepali Congress leader Sujatha Koirala as the deputy Prime Minister.         
	Sujatha was sworn in as the deputy Prime Minister amidst reports of her father Girija Prasad Koirala getting closer to the Maoists. Rumours have been rife in Kathmandu that the senior Koirala, who continues to wield considerable influence in Nepals politics, was plotting the fall of the coalition government with the Maoists.         
	The Maoists on their part have been issuing statements on the impending fall of the coalition government. Yesterday Maoist number two Baburam Bhattarai announced publicly that the government will fall after Tihar festival later this month paving the way for a national government led by the Maoists.         
	The reports also said that the octogenarian leader had fallen out with Prime Minister Nepal after his only daughter was denied the post of the deputy Prime Minister. In fact things had come to such a pass that Sujatha pulled out of the Prime Ministerial entourage to India in August at the last minute citing health reasons.         
	Despite her promotion Sujatha will hold the number three position in the Cabinet after Terai leader and senior Deputy Prime Minister Bijay Kumar Gachhadhar. Significantly Sujatha is the second senior member of the cabinet after Prime Minister Nepal, who had lost in the Constituent Assembly elections last year.

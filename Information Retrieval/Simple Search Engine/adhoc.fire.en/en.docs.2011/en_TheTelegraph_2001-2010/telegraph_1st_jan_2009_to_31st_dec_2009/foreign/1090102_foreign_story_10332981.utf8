	Shopping saviour    
	 London, Jan. 1: Some celebrities donate to charity, others become goodwill ambassadors for the UN. But Paris Hilton is doing her bit for the world by shopping.       
	The US socialite has declared herself a saviour who shops for the greater good in difficult economic times.      
	 Sydney to host a New Years dance party, Hilton drew criticism for spending 2,675 in a 40-minute shopping spree. Local charities accused her of callous excess, but Hilton defended the splurge.      
	Im in Australia, I think its important to help out, you know, the economy out here, everywhere in the world, she told reporters. And whats wrong with doing a little shopping? Its New Years, I need a New Years dress.

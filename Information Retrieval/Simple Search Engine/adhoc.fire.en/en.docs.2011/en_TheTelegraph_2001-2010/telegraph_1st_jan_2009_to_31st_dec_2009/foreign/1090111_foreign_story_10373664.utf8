	Sauce from hell    
	 New York, Jan. 10 (AP): Careful with this hot sauce: It will definitely burn.      
	New York City artist Alex Gardega is selling $10 bottles of habanero hot sauce dedicated to disgraced Wall Street financier Bernard Madoff. He calls it, Bernie in hell. But Gardega says he doesnt really want people to put the condiment on food. He warns on his website that its hellishly hot.       
	Instead, Gardega says he is making a statement about Madoff, who has been accused of bilking investors out of $50 billion.      
	The Manhattan painter designed the label which featuers Madoff with satanic horns. flames, dollar signs in his eyes and a devilish grin. A chef created the fiery condiment. The text on the bottle reads: You can take the money but can you take... the heat?!!!

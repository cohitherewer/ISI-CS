	Hurley buzz     
	 London, March 8: Elizabeth Hurleys busy schedule after her marriage may have affected her relationship with husband Arun Nayar, the actresss friends fear.       
	With a swimwear and gift company, an organic farm and her various television and modelling commitments, she has sometimes been unable to spend as much time with Nayar as she may have liked.       
	Yesterday, there was even speculation the couple might be about to announce their separation. When Hurleys spokesperson was contacted, she made no effort to deny the claims. After a long pause, she said there would be no comment.

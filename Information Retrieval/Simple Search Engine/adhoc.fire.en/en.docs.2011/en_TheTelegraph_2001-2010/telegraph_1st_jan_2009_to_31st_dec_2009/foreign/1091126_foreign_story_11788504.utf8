	Polanski bail    
	 Zurich, Nov. 25 (Reuters): A Swiss court has granted the release of director Roman Polanski on bail of $4.49 million.      
	A Swiss justice ministry spokesperson said Polanskis release would not happen immediately. Swiss television quoted the justice minister as saying she saw no reason to appeal against the courts decision.      
	Polanski, 76, pleaded guilty to having sex with a 13-year-old girl in 1977 but fled the US on the eve of his 1978 sentencing, before being arrested this year in Switzerland.    
	Haj     
	 Jeddah (Reuters): Heavy rain and floods killed at least 13 people and stranded thousands of pilgrims in the Saudi Arabian port city of Jeddah on Wednesday on the first day of Haj. The floods shut a motorway to Mecca, leaving pilgrims unable to complete their journey. At least 13 people were killed in accidents or drowned, officials said, but none were thought to be pilgrims.    
	Obama     
	 Washington (Reuters): President Barack Obama will go to Copenhagen for a UN climate change meeting on December 9.

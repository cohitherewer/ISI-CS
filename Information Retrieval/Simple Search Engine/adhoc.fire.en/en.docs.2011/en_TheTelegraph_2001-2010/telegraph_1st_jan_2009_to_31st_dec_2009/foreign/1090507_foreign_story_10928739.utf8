          K.P. NAYAR                          Zardari arrives at the White House to meet Obama on Wednesday. (AP)                                  
	Washington, May 6: The first day of a two-day trilateral summit of the presidents of Pakistan, Afghanistan and the US was vitiated by Islamabads familiar obsession with India and a seemingly errant American bombing raid in Afghanistan which, according to the Red Cross, killed dozens of people who may have been innocent civilians.        
	Pakistani lobbyists burned midnight oil on the eve of the summit in an effort to remove conditions in a bill before the US House of Representatives for massive aid to Islamabad that would require it to cease support, including by any elements within the Pakistan military or its intelligence agency, to extremist and terrorist groups, particularly to any group that has conducted attacks... against the territory of India or the people of India.        
	Another provision in the bill, sponsored by Howard Berman, chairman of the House of Representatives Foreign Affairs Committee, calls upon Pakistan to improve relations with India, insisting that long-term security in Pakistan depends on strengthening regional relationships among India, Pakistan, and Afghanistan.        
	Other conditions for aid to Islamabad requires the US president to certify every year that Pakistan has closed terrorist camps, including those of Jamaat-ud-Dawa and Lashkar-e-Toiba, two groups that bleed India, taken steps to prevent cross-border attacks meaning attacks like the one on Mumbai in November last year  and cease(d) all support for extremist and terrorist groups.        
	The requirement of an annual presidential certification is akin to the Presseler Amemndment, which became a diplomatic football in the 1990s in Pakistan-US relations, resulting in the suspension of Washingtons military assistance to Islamabad at one point.        
	At the time of going to press the lobbyists do not appear to have made much headway, but their efforts are continuing.        
	Although a Senate version of the bill has fewer conditionalities and does not name India, it was still making Pakistanis apoplectic as president Asif Ali Zardaris high level delegation trooped into the White House for the summit.        
	The Senate bill, whose movers are John Kerry, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and Dick Lugar, the committees top Republican, also requires annual presidential certifications that Pakistan is doing enough to fight al Qaida and the Taliban.        
	The legislation has lit the fuse under the Pakistan military by demanding certification by the White House that the Army General Headquarters in Rawalpindi is not interfering in the normal work of political and judicial institutions of Pakistan.        
	This is heresy to the men in uniform in Pakistan, who have always considered it their divine right to interfere with democratic institutions and keep them on a leash.        
	The bombings in Farah province, in which there are estimates of upto 120 Afghan deaths, was a bad augury for the two-day summit. But secretary of state Hillary Clinton attempted to put the best face on it with a suo motu remark at the start of her meetings with Karzai that Washington deeply, deeply regretted the loss of innocent life.        
	To pre-empt criticism that the trilateral summit to remove misuderstandings between Islamabad and Kabul has been a failure, an agreement for trade and transit between them was signed at the state department here.        
	The agreement has been stalled for 43 years. Living up to his usual hyperbole, Zardari called the Afghan president my dear brother President Karzai when they appeared at the state department.

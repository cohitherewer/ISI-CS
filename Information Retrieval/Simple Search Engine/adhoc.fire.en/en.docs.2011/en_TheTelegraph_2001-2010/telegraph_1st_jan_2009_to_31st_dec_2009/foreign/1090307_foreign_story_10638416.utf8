	Jackson return    
	 London, March 6: Michael Jackson declared his return to the world stage with a typically eccentric performance as he announced a series of ten shows at the O2 Arena in East London that could net him 50million, reports The Times, London.      
	 thousand fans were kept waiting for 90 minutes before Jackson appeared for a brief statement that consisted mainly of him repeating the phrase this is it and punching the air.      
	The first of his concerts, which AEG Live, the promoter, promised would be two-hour all-singing and all-dancing spectaculars, will be held on July 8, with tickets on sale for between 50 and 75.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Clooney Up in Air over layoffs
                                                                                                               Clooney Up in Air over layoffs

	Rome, Oct. 17 (AP): George Clooney says there is a lot he can relate to in his new film Up in the Air, a comic drama about a man who travels across the US to lay off people amid the financial crisis.        
	Like his character, Clooney says he has worked around the clock, at times to the detriment of his friendships and family relations. And while he doesnt fire people for a living, Clooney says he had his fair share of layoffs before becoming a Hollywood star. There are a lot of things about this guy I understand, Clooney said of his character, speaking at the Rome Film Festival where the Jason Reitman movie was presented today.         
	Part of it is  and a good portion of it is  that you can spend a large part of your time literally up in the air, you can spend it working and missing part of your life. I spent a long time unemployed and when you are broke and unemployed, when you finally start working you dont wanna stop, Clooney said. Sometimes when you do that youll end up missing your family, your friends, people that you care about.        
	Clooneys character, corporate downsizing expert Ryan Bingham, is busier than ever as companies struggle in the financial crisis. As he travels across America, he tries to rack up a million frequent-flyer miles. To know me is to fly with me. This is where I live, Bingham says at one point in the movie, as he expertly navigates check-ins and security controls in one of the US airports he calls home. But his desire to live an isolated life on the road, with no strings attached, is put to test when he meets fellow frequent-flyer Alex, played by Vera Farmiga.         
	The movie received warm applause at a press screening at the festival, where it is running for best-picture award. It is director Reitmans follow-up to Juno, which won in Rome in 2007 and was a best-picure nominee at the Oscars.

	Fort Collins (Colorado), Oct. 16: For hours yesterday, people all over the US were gripped by television images of a homemade silver balloon careening through the skies near here, whooshing over fields and trees and yards with a six-year-old boy believed inside.         
	A search party was readied  on foot, on horseback, in helicopters loaded with infrared sensors  to scour the aircrafts path of more than 96km, some terrified that the boy might have fallen from his accidental perch.         
	In the early afternoon, the balloon landed near Denver International Airport, but the boy was not in it. At last, near dusk, he was found, hiding in a box in his familys garage attic, fearful his father would be angry at him for touching the flying machine his parent had built in their backyard.        
	The boys journey, it turned out, had never begun.         
	Quite frankly, I couldnt stand, the boys father, Richard Heene, said of the moment his youngest son, Falcon, suddenly reappeared inside the familys home in Fort Collins. He scared the heck out of us.         
	By nightfall, questions were emerging about the public costs of the episode, which interrupted departures from the Denver airport, and about how Falcon had managed to stay hidden in the attic as the authorities searched the family home.        
	But, Heene  whose family (including three young boys) had received national attention  said that all was exactly as it appeared. One of his older sons had seen Falcon near the helium-filled aircraft, moments before its tether came loose, and it flew off. And, so, he said, all day, the family believed that the boy was in it.        
	The contraption, something neighbours said they had seen Heene, who describes himself as a scientist, working on for ages, took to the skies around 11am over this mostly rural region of northern Colorado. Within about 30 minutes, family members, hearing the insistent story of Falcons brother Bradford, 10, summoned the authorities.         
	Soon, they were racing in helicopters and fire engines after the craft  topped with a balloon about 6 metres wide and 2 metres long  as cameras in news helicopters followed. It whipped along on the gusty day, with winds reaching 32km per hour at times.         
	After nearly three hours, with cameras still rolling, the craft floated gently to a rest in a dirt field not far from the airport. As emergency vehicles surrounded the craft, the authorities nervously opened it. They found no one inside.        
	The authorities weighed all the possibilities, including the chance that Falcon might simply have never been inside the craft at all. Finally, as Sheriff Jim Alderden of Larimer county was speaking to reporters near the Heene family home about the search that was under way, the news filtered in. He flashed a thumbs up sign and simply said: Hes alive. Hes in the house.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Tehran axe on two ministers
                                                                                                               Tehran axe on two ministers
                            
	Tehran, July 26 (Reuters): Iran President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad today dismissed the intelligence and culture ministers, a news agency reported.        
	The semi-official Mehr news agency quoted an unnamed source as saying the two ministers had a dispute with the hard-line President over the appointment of Esfandiar Rahim Mashaie as first Vice-President for Ahmadinejads second four-year term.        
	Culture and Islamic guidance minister Mohammad Hossein Saffar-Harandi and intelligence minister Gholam Hossein Mohseni-Ejei were sacked on Sunday, the news agency said.         
	Unconfirmed reports say the health and labour ministers were also sacked by the President, Mehr reported.        
	An official at the presidential office said he could confirm only the intelligence ministers dismissal.        
	Irans supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei ordered Ahmadinejad last week to dismiss Mashaie who had said Iran was friends with everyone, even the people of arch-foe Israel.        
	The President remained defiant until yesterday when he dismissed Mashaie, to whom he is related by marriage. But Mashaie was appointed Ahmadinejads chief of staff.

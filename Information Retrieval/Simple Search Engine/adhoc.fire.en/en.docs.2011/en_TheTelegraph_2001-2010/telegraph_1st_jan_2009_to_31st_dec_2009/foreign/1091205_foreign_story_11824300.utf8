	Turin (Italy), Dec. 4 (Reuters): A jailed mafia hitman linked Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi to the Cosa Nostra today, telling a court that a godfather convicted of a 1993 bombing campaign had boasted of his links to the media mogul.        
	Berlusconi says biased courts are making false charges to bring down the 19-month-old government  his third since 1994.        
	Mafia pentito, or mobster-turned-witness, Gaspare Spatuzza told a court in Turin that a Mafia clan leader later jailed for the attacks had named Berlusconi in connection with the bombings.        
	He recounted a meeting with clan boss Giuseppe Graviano  later given multiple life sentences  in a cafe on Romes Via Veneto early 1994, after the deadly bombing campaign. Graviano told me we had obtained everything, thanks to the seriousness of the people who had helped with our affair ... he mentioned two names, he called Berlusconi the man from Channel 5, said Spatuzza.

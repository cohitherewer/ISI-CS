	Nicole secrets    
	 London, Nov. 17 (PTI): Actor Tom Cruise has nothing to fear from his former wife Nicole Kidman as the actress has no plans to reveal their marriage secrets and write a memoir.       
	Kidman, who won the best actress Oscar for her role in The Hours, said she will never tell all in an expose and will always stay tight-lipped about her almost 10-year marriage to Cruise, their adopted children and his Scientology beliefs.      
	I would never write a memoir. There are things that happen behind closed doors, and thats where they belong. Im not secretive. Im protective, she said.

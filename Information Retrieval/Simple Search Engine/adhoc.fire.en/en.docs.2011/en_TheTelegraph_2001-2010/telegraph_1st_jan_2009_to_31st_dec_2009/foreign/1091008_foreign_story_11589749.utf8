	London, Oct. 7 (Reuters): Nursery rhymes are losing ground in Britains affections, according to a survey today, with many parents finding them too old fashioned and of no educational value.        
	But for those who still believe, the favourite has proved to be Twinkle Twinkle Little Star ahead of Incey Wincey Spider .        
	Only a third of more than 2,500 parents surveyed use nursery rhymes regularly with their children, while almost a quarter admit they have never sung a rhyme with their child.The poll, for National Bookstart Day on Friday, also found more than a fifth of young parents did not use nursery rhymes because they were not considered educational.         
	The survey also revealed that:         
	 The younger generation no longer knows all the words to traditional rhymes: over 74 per cent of 55-plus year-olds knew all the words to Little Miss Muffet, compared to only 58 per cent of 16-24 year olds.        
	 Men are far less confident about singing nursery rhymes. Only 52 per cent of men surveyed knew all the words to Twinkle Twinkle Little Star compared to 83 per cent of women        
	 Most parents said they used nursery rhymes because they make children laugh, while 18 per cent use them instead of reading a bedtime story.

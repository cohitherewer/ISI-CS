	London, Feb. 2: The worst snowfall for nearly 20 years has paralysed Britain, closing schools, airports, motorways and railways and forcing millions to stay at home.         
	Up to 1 feet of snow fell in parts of the southeast and the Pennines while most of the country was blanketed in at least four inches of it. Forecasters are warning of worse to come and the Arctic blizzards are being treated as an extreme weather event. The Met Office said that it was the most widespread snowfall in Britain for 18 years.         
	With bus and train services out of action and drivers urged to stay off the roads, a handful of commuters took to skiing through the streets of London. Emergency services were stretched dealing with accidents across the country. In Wales, mountain rescue teams and an RAF helicopter mounted an urgent search for two brothers feared missing in Snowdonia.         
	Thousands of passengers were stranded at airports, including Heathrow, Gatwick, Stansted, Southampton and Luton, as snow forced the closure of runways and the cancellation of hundreds of flights.         
	Hundreds of schools were also closed across Essex, Kent, London, Birmingham, the West Midlands and East Anglia. Major motorways were in gridlock as the morning rush got under way and transport links used by millions of commuters in and around the capital were crippled.         
	As many as 20,000 people planning to travel to and from the continent suffered disruption as Eurostar staff struggled to get to work. A Eurostar spokesman said earlier trains had run normally but staff were now unable to get to work, so trains were subject to delay and cancellation. We would advise passengers to stay at home and check the website, she said.         
	The North Downs and Pennines bore the brunt of the overnight blizzards with at least 10 inches in many places. But the snow extended across much of the country with four inches of snow common and forecasters are warning of more to come.

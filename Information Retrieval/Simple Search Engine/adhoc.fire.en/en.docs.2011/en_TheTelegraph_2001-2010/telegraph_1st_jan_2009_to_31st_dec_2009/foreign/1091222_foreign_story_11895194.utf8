                              Rajapaksa: Letter study                            
	Colombo, Dec. 21 (Reuters): The UN wants the Sri Lankan government to explain allegations about the deaths of senior Tamil Tiger rebels in the closing stages of the countrys civil war, the Presidents office said today.        
	Earlier this month, a newspaper reported that retired General Sarath Fonseka, who is challenging President Mahinda Rajapaksa in a January election, had said government soldiers were ordered to shoot surrendering Tamil Tiger rebels. Fonseka subsequently said the paper had misquoted him and he denied any such shootings took place.        
	The statement from Rajapaksas office said the UN Special Rapporteur on Extra-judicial, Summary or Arbitrary Executions has asked the government to provide explanations with regard to the circumstances of the death of three senior LTTE cadres and their families at the last stages of military operations to defeat the LTTE in May this year. The statement said the government was making a careful study of the UN Rapporteurs letter, prior to a formal response.        
	The Sri Lankan government had earlier denounced the reported comments.        
	In May, Sri Lanka crushed the LTTE and ended their quarter-century war to create a separate nation for the Tamil ethnic minority on the Indian Ocean island nation.         
	Fonseka and defence secretary Gotabaya Rajapaksa, the Presidents brother, led the government campaign that brought an end to the insurgency,.

	London, Nov. 13 (PTI): Jasmine Dotiwala is neither rich nor famous. However, the Indian-origin TV producer is Mariah Careys best friend.        
	Jasmine, who was born and brought up in the London suburb of Southall, has known Carey for the past 12 years and has spent all her Christmas holidays with Carey in her luxurious holiday home in Aspen, Colorado.        
	They had first met when Jasmine, then an MTV anchor, was asked to interview Carey at a villa in Capri, reports the Daily Mail.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | UK teen free after hoax bomb call to White House
                                                                                                               UK teen free after hoax bomb call to White House
                            
	London, July 27 (Reuters): A British teenager who phoned the White House and claimed as part of a drunken prank that there was a bomb in the centre of New York, escaped jail today.        
	Thomas Hutchinson, 19, from Sheffield, northern England, made a giggling call to the White House switchboard after drinking with friends at a barbecue last May, and claimed there was a bomb in Madison Square Garden.        
	The operator pressed a malicious call trace button and it was found to have been made in Britain. Prosecutor Stephen Acaster said there was great concern when the call was first received but it was soon realised it was a hoax and Madison Square Garden was not evacuated.        
	Hutchinson was tracked down following an investigation involving the American secret service, the FBI, the New York city police department and British counter-terrorism police. He initially denied the charge when he was interviewed by police but later pleaded guilty, the Press Association reported.

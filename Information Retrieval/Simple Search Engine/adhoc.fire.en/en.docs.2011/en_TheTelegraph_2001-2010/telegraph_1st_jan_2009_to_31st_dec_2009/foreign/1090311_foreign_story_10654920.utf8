The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Scarf bar on US woman

	Washington, March 10: A Muslim woman was asked to leave her place in line at a credit union in Southern Maryland and be served in a back room because the head scarf she wore for religious reasons violated the institutions no hats, hoods or sunglasses policy, the woman said yesterday.         
	The incident at the Navy Federal Credit Union on Saturday was the second in a month for Kenza Shelley, and Muslim advocates fear it could become a problem nationwide as many financial institutions, intent on curbing robberies and identity theft, ban hats and similar items without appropriate accommodations for religious attire.         
	Shelley, 54, who runs a day care out of her home in Lexington Park, said she has used the credit union in the St Marys County community of California for more than 10 years. Until February, no employees had complained about her head scarf, which covers her hair but not her face. But a few weeks ago, she said, she was standing in line to deposit a check when an employee asked her to come to the back room, referring to a new policy that prohibited hats, hoods and sunglasses. She complied but asked whether she would have to go through the same process each time she made a transaction.         
	On Saturday, Shelley said, employees again asked her to come to the back room if she would not remove her head scarf. No, she recalled telling them, I want to be served like everybody else. She left the credit union and called the council on American-Islamic Relations, which lobbies and advocates for the Muslim community. There was so many people there, and I was embarrassed, she said.

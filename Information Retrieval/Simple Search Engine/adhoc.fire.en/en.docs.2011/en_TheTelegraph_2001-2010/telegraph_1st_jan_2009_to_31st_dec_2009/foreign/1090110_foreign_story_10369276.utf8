The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Obama in Berry pitch
                                                                                                               Obama in Berry pitch
          STEPHANIE CLIFFORD                          Obama with his BlackBerry. (AP)                                  
	Washington, Jan. 9: This week, Olympic swimming star Michael Phelps signed a deal worth more than $1 million to advertise Mazda in China. TV actor Jerry Seinfeld earned a reported $10 million to appear in Microsofts recent television campaign.         
	But the person who may be the biggest celebrity pitchman in the world is not earning a penny for his work. President-elect Barack Obama has repeatedly said how much his BlackBerry means to him and how he is dreading the prospect of being forced to give it up, because of legal and security concerns, once he takes office.         
	Im still clinging to my BlackBerry, Obama said on Wednesday in an interview with CNBC and The New York Times. Theyre going to pry it out of my hands.        
	What could the BlackBerry President charge for his plugs of the device if he were not a public servant? More than $25 million, marketing experts say, and maybe as much as $50 million.        
	This would be almost the biggest endorsement deal in the history of endorsements, said Doug Shabelman, the president of Burns Entertainment, which arranges deals between celebrities and companies. Hes consistently seen using it and consistently in the news arguing  and arguing with issues of national security and global welfare  how he absolutely needs this to function on a daily basis.        
	Obama is an ideal marketing representative, other agents say  popular, constantly in the news and explicit about his attachment to the product.        
	You always want the celebrity to be a good fit with your brand, and is anybody considered a better communicator right now than Barack Obama, or a better networker? said Fran Kelly, the chief executive of the advertising agency Arnold Worldwide, who estimated that an endorsement by Obama would be worth $25 million. Shabelman put the value even higher, at $50 million or more.

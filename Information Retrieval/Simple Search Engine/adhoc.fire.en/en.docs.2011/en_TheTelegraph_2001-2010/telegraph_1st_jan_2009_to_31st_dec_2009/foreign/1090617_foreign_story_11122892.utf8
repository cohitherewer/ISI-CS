	Jolie video    
	 London, June 16 (PTI): Actress Angelina Jolie, who is a UN goodwill ambassador, has shot a video urging people to recognise the plight of refugees around the world.       
	Jolie visited a refugee centre in Northern Thailand in February this year and her experiences led her to make an appeal urging Thai officials to free thousands of displaced Myanmarese citizens being held in camps.       
	Reports said that her comments drew the wrath of the Thai government who slammed UN authorities for allowing the star to visit the camps. But Jolie has refused to slow her campaign and has gone ahead to shoot a video for the occasion of World Refugee Day, on June 20.    
	Lottery luck     
	 London (Reuters): A 74-year-old amateur gardener who scooped a 25 million lottery prize said on Tuesday he would spend part of his winnings hiring an expert to learn how to grow better carrots. Brian Caswell said he had always struggled with the vegetable on the prize-winning allotment he maintains.

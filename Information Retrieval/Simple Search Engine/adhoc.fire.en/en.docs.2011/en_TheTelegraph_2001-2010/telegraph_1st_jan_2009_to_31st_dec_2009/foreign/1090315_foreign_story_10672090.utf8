The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Court issues warrant for Lohans arrest
                                                                                                               Court issues warrant for Lohans arrest
                            
	Beverly Hills, March 14 (AP): Beverly Hills police say an arrest warrant has been issued for actress Lindsay Lohan and they believe it involves her 2007 drunken driving conviction.        
	Police Sergeant Mike Foxen said today that a court issued the warrant yesterday but he said he did not have any details. He says police had not yet contacted the actress.        
	It is our hope that Ms Lohan will surrender herself so that this matter can be resolved in a timely manner, Beverly Hills police Lieutenant Mark Rosen said in a statement.         
	Lohans publicist and lawyer did not immediately return calls seeking comment today.         
	Lohan pleaded guilty or no contest to driving under the influence and cocaine charges after she crashed her Mercedes into a tree in Beverly Hills in 2007 and later chased the mother of an acquaintance into Santa Monica in a sports utility vehicle.        
	She could go to jail if she violates any terms of her three-year probation.

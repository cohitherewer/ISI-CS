                                                                                                               Bangla envoy to face trial
                            
	Dhaka, Jan. 12 (PTI): Prime Minister Sheikh Hasinas new government is recalling Bangladeshs envoy to Malaysia so that he can face trial for his suspected role in the 1975 military coup.        
	The decision has been taken to recall him (former army major Khairuzzaman) but it is yet to be communicated to him, a senior foreign ministry official said, preferring to remain anonymous.        
	Khairuzzaman was sent to Malaysia while he was facing trial for the November 3, 1975, jail massacre of Syed Nazrul Islam, Tajuddin Ahmed, M. Monsur Ali and A.H.M. Qamaruzzaman who led the 1971 Liberation War as leaders of the government-in-exile.

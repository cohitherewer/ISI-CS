	Washington, Jan. 4 (Reuters) Former President George H.W. Bush said today hed like to see his second son, Jeb, become President of the US some day.        
	Interviewed on Fox News today, Bush said his second son, a former governor of Florida, had all the qualifications to serve in the White House.        
	Jeb Bush, 55, has said he was considering running for a US Senate seat representing Florida in 2010. The current incumbent, Republican Mel Martinez, has announced he is stepping down.        
	Id like to see him run. Id like to see him be President one day, or senator, whatever, yes I would, said Bush, who served as President from 1989-1993. Right now is probably a bad time. Weve had enough Bushes in there, he added.

	Winslet woes    
	 London, April 29: She is an Oscar-winner, national treasure and role model for real women everywhere, but Kate Winslet wonders why she is not known by another epithet: working class hero, reports The Daily Telegraph.       
	The British actress has complained that she is wrongly perceived as middle class on account of her perfect diction. The reality, she insisted, was a loving but impoverished background as the daughter of out-of-work actors who struggled to pay the bills.       
	Winslet, 33, expressed her annoyance at those who doubted her working class credentials. People dont believe that. People literally think Im lying, she said. Asked why the British did not regard her as a working class hero, she replied: Because I speak nice.      
	She recalled an audition as a teenager in which a director, upon hearing her accent, refused to believe she was from Reading.       
	He went: I hope youre not as dishonest in your work as you are about your own life. I was shocked. My dad was very much a struggling actor and spent more of his life as a postman, as a member of a tarmac firm, as a van driver. Hed sell Christmas trees. Anything.       
	The star of Titanic and Revolutionary Road was raised with her three siblings in a terraced house in East Reading. Her parents still live in the town.

	Jolie threat    
	 London, June 24 (PTI): Angelina Jolie has reportedly told Jennifer Aniston to back off from partner Brad Pitt in a text message from Pitts mobile phone.      
	The Hollywood superstars are considered arch enemies and reports claim that the Tomb Raider actress is not happy with Pitts growing closeness to his ex-wife.       
	Look magazine has quoted insider sources as saying that Jolie, who is upset over split rumours with Pitt, sent the warnings via Pitts mobile and signed them off with her initials, AJ, reports the Daily Mail.    
	Depp tip    
	London (PTI): Actor Johnny Depps generosity seems unaffected by the economic recession as the star left a tip of $4,000 at a Chicago restaurant. The Pirates of the Caribbean star had dinner with director Michael Mann and his co-stars from the movie Public Enemies, including Oscar-winning actress Marrion Cottilard, at the Gibsons Bar and Steakhouse. He left a $4,000 tip for waiter Mohammed A. Sekhani. Depp hosted a party of 15 people, including Mann and Cotillard, and the tip was split 12 ways. Depp is the finest of all the stars I have ever waited on. And he is a true icon.

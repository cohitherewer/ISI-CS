	Jolie set collapse    
	 Los Angeles, April 6 (PTI): Angelina Jolie was forced to seek medical attention when she collapsed on the sets of Salt while shooting for the film in New York.      
	The 33-year-old actress collapsed in the middle of the shoot due to physical and emotional exhaustion amidst rumours of rift between her and partner Brad Pitt, reported Now magazine online.      
	She collapsed between takes, complaining of shortness of breath and dizzy spells. She never eats properly when shes upset. Food is the last thing on her mind. Shell ignore breakfast, pick at lunch and skip dinner, a source inside the studio told the magazine.      
	The news comes close on the heels of reports that Jolies relationship with her partner of three years, Brad Pitt, has hit a rocky patch with the actress secluding herself from Pitt and their six children. The actress is also rumoured to be on a liquid diet in a bid to lose 21 pounds in 21 days so she can give a convincing performance as a man, one of her character CIA agent Evelyn Salts many disguises.     
	Post bands    
	London, April 6 (Reuters): Postmen should face on-the-spot fines for throwing away the red rubber bands they use to bundle letters, a litter watchdog said today.      
	Keep Britain Tidy said Royal Mail staff are not above the law and should be subject to the same 80 spot fine for littering as other members of the public. Elastic bands may not be as visually offensive as dog dirt or half-eaten pizza, but they are most definitely litter, said the charitys Dickie Felton. Is it really too much to ask them to put the rubber bands in their pocket as they do their daily rounds?       
	Postal workers met the calls for spot fines with disbelief. Its a silly idea really.

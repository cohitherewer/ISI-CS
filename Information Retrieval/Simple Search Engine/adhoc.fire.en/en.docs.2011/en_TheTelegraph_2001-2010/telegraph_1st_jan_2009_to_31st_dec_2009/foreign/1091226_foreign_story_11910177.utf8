The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Osama kin in Saudi mission: Iran
                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      Osama kin in Saudi mission: Iran
                              Manouchehr Mottaki                            
	Tehran, Dec. 25 (AP): Iran confirmed yesterday that a daughter of al Qaida leader Osama bin Laden had turned up at the Saudi embassy in Tehran.        
	However, Tehran said it did not know how she entered the country.        
	A Saudi newspaper reported on Wednesday that Bin Ladens 17-year-old daughter, Eman, went to the embassy after eluding guards in Iran who have held her, her sister and four brothers under house arrest for eight years.        
	It has long been believed that Iran has held in custody a number of bin Ladens children since they fled Afghanistan after the US-led invasion of that country in 2001  most notably Saad and Hamza bin Laden, who have held positions in al Qaida.        
	Foreign minister Manouchehr Mottaki said on a TV talk show yesterday that Iran had no idea Eman was in the country until it heard from the embassy that she was there.        
	Mottaki said if Iranian authorities are able to confirm her identity she would be free to leave Iran.        
	 Some time ago, the embassy of Saudi Arabia informed us that one of the daughters of Bin Laden is in the embassy, Mottaki said.        
	We dont know how this person went to the embassy or how she entered the country.        
	Mottaki made no mention of the other Bin Laden children and he was not asked on the TV programme whether Iran was holding them.        
	Osama bin Laden reportedly has 19 children by several wives. He took at least one of his wives and their children with him to Afghanistan in the late 1990s after he was thrown out of his previous refuge, Sudan. They fled when the US-led war erupted, including the group that tried to escape through Iran.        
	This year, US officials said Saad bin Laden, the al Qaida leaders eldest son, may have been killed by a US airstrike in Pakistan, where they said he may have fled after being freed from Iran, but they could not confirm the information.        
	In an email to The Associated Press yesterday, Omar bin Laden, another son who lives abroad, appealed to the Iranian government to let his family there be reunited with their relatives in Saudi Arabia, Syria or Qatar. He said the Iranian government took good care of his family, providing them with all their needs and keeping them in a walled compound for protection.        
	 He said the bin Laden children known to remain in the compound were sons Mohammed, Hamza, Othman and Bakr and daughter Fatima. Also there are 25 other relatives, including their spouses and their children.        
	Omar bin Laden said in his email that 29-year-old Saad left the compound less than a year ago and his whereabouts is unknown. Most of the al Qaida leaders children, like Omar, live as legitimate businessmen. The extended bin Laden family, one of the wealthiest in Saudi Arabia, disowned Osama in 1994 when Saudi Arabia stripped him of his citizenship because of his militant activities.        
	Osama bin Ladens billionaire father, Mohammed, who died in 1967, had more than 50 children.

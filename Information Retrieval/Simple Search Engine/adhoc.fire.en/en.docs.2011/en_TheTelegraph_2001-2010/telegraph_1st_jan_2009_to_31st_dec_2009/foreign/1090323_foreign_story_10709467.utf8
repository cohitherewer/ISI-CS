The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | PM-Sharif in peace bid as top judge returns 
                                                                                                               PM-Sharif in peace bid as top judge returns 
                              Chaudhry: Back in office                            
	Lahore, March 22 (Agencies): Nawaz Sharif today demanded that the ruling Pakistan Peoples Party should scrap the Presidents sweeping powers and restore the constitution to resolve differences as Pakistan Prime Minister Yousaf Raza Gilani offered an olive branch to the Opposition leader.        
	Gilani visited the Pakistan Muslim League (Nawaz) chiefs residence in Lahore today for a fence-mending meeting.        
	The two leaders called for reconciliation but refrained from announcing any concrete agreement.        
	Emerging from the meeting, Sharif said a key demand of the PML-N was fulfilled with the governments decision to reinstate Chief Justice Iftikhar Mohammed Chaudhry and other judges sacked by former President Pervez Musharraf during the emergency rule in 2007.         
	Chaudhry returned to work today. Hundreds of lawyers and activists who have agitated for the top judges return gathered outside his home for a ceremonial flag-raising. They carried balloons and threw rose petals, calling the judges reinstatement a milestone for democracy.        
	Sharif said at a joint news conference with Gilani the PPP-led government should now implement the Charter of Democracy, which was signed by the two parties in 2006.         
	Under the charter, the 17th amendment that gives the President sweeping powers should be scrapped and the constitution restored to its position before the 1999 military takeover which led to Sharifs removal as Prime Minister.        
	Gilani sahab is our Prime Minister and (PPP chief Asif Ali) Zardari sahab is our President. If the Charter of Democracy is implemented, there is no question of us going towards any destabilisation, Sharif said.

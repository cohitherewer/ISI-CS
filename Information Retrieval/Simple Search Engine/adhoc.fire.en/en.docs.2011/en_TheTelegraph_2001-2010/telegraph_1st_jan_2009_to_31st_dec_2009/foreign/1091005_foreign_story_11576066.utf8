	Directed by Peter Kosminsky, The Spare will show Harrys life after losing his mother Princess Diana and his posting in Afghanistan. Kosminsky is considering British actors Grint and Pattinson for the lead as well as Pride and Prejudice star Rupert Friend, reports the Daily Star.    
	Garner lies    
	 London (PTI): Actress Jennifer Garner, who will next be seen in Invention of Lying, says that even in real life she doesnt like to tell the truth if it is going to hurt someone close to her. I would not even attempt to go one day without lying. What if someone asks you how you are and you have to stop and tell them how you are really feeling? You would never get through the day. No, I have to lie. I think we all do, Garner said.     
	Ford ego    
	 London (PTI): Actor Harrison Ford insists that all Hollywood stars are consumed by their egos and are really bothered about what is written about them. The Indiana Jones star reveals that he himself is not an exception and nurtures a huge ego. If any actor says he doesnt care whats written about him, hes a liar. Actors are completely devoured by our own egos. I have a huge ego, too, but I invest it in my work based on the principle that you can always improve, said Ford.    
	Berry less    
	 London (PTI): Oscar-winning actress Halle Berry has admitted that too much of make-up on her face makes her feel like a man in drag. The Monsters Ball star prefers to show off her natural good looks rather than apply beauty products. Less is more. When I wear too much make-up, I feel like a man in drag.

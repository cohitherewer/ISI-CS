The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | US jet overshoots runway in Jamaica
                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      US jet overshoots runway in Jamaica

	Kingston, Dec. 23 (AP): An American Airlines flight carrying 154 people skidded across a Jamaican runway in heavy rain, bouncing across the tarmac and injuring more than 90 people before it stopped just short of the Caribbean Sea, officials and witnesses said.        
	Panicked passengers screamed and baggage burst from overhead bins as Flight 331 from Miami careened down the runway in the capital, Kingston, last night, one passenger said.        
	The impact cracked open the fuselage, crushed the left landing gear and separated both engines from the Boeing 737-800, airline spokesman Tim Smith said.        
	Crews evacuated dazed and bloodied passengers onto a beach from a cabin that smelled of smoke and jet fuel, passengers said. Rain poured through the planes broken roof, one said.        
	Some 90 people were taken to hospitals with broken bones and back pains and four were seriously hurt, airport and Jamaican government officials said. American Airlines said two people were admitted to the hospital and nobody suffered life-threatening injuries.        
	The plane skidded across a causeway road before coming to a halt on a grassy embankment. Two gaping cracks marked the fuselage, and the jets mangled nose section tilted downward just short of the ocean.        
	Heavy turbulence on the way to Jamaica had forced the crew to halt the beverage service three times before giving up, Pilar Abaurrea of Keene, New Hampshire, told The Associated Press by phone. The pilot warned of more turbulence just before landing but said it would not be much worse, she said.        
	All of a sudden, when it hit the ground, the plane was kind of bouncing. Someone said the plane was skidding and there was panic, she said.        
	US investigators will analyse whether the plane should have been landing in such bad weather, Smith said, adding that other planes had landed safely in the heavy rain.        
	Passenger Natalie Morales Hendricks told NBCs Today programme that the plane began to skid upon landing and before I knew it, everything was black and we were crashing. Everybodys overhead baggage started to fall. Literally, it was like being in a car accident. People were screaming, I was screaming, she added.

                                                                                                               Flu pandemic fear
                            
	Mexico City/Geneva, April 25 (Reuters): A new flu strain that has killed up to 68 people in Mexico could become a pandemic, the World Health Organisation warned today, as health experts tried to track the diseases spread.        
	Hospitals tested patients with flu symptoms for the never-before-seen virus, which has also infected eight people in the US. No further deaths had come to light since Friday afternoon, but officials warned the person-to-person infections meant there was a risk of a major outbreak. It has pandemic potential because it is infecting people, WHO director-general Margaret Chan said in Geneva.        
	However, we cannot say on the basis of currently available laboratory, epidemiological and clinical evidence whether or not it will indeed cause a pandemic. The new flu strain  a mixture of swine, human and avian flu viruses  is still poorly understood and the situation is evolving quickly, Chan said.        
	Mexico Citys health secretary, Armando Ahued, said no new flu deaths had been reported since yesterday, when Mexico gave the death toll as 20 confirmed and 48 other possible deaths. In all, 1,004 suspected cases have been reported nationwide.        
	Mexico has shut schools, cinemas and museums and cancelled public events in its sprawling, overcrowded capital of 20 million people to try to prevent further infections. Weekend soccer matches were played in empty stadiums and people on the street wore face masks. The strain of flu has spread fast between people and infected some individuals who had no contact with one another.        
	The WHO says the virus from 12 of the Mexican patients is genetically the same as a new strain of swine flu, designated H1N1, seen in eight people in California and Texas. All of the eight later recovered. An emergency committee of WHO experts will advise Chan on issues including possibly changing the WHOs pandemic alert level, currently 3 on a scale of 1 to 6.        
	We do not yet have a complete picture of the epidemiology or the risk, including possible spread beyond the currently affected areas, Chan said.

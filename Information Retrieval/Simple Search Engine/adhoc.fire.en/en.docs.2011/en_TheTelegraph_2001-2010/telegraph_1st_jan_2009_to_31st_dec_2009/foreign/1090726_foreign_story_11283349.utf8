                                                                                                               Korea fast food
                            
	Seoul, July 25 (AP): You still cant get a hamburger in Pyongyang, but the suspiciously similar minced beef and bread is for sale at the North Korean capitals first fast food restaurant, a news report said today.        
	 The Samtaeseong restaurant opened in the isolated communist country last month in cooperation with a Singaporean company, according to the Tokyo-based Choson Sinbo. The Singaporean company, which the newspaper did not name, provided training to restaurant staff and supplied equipment.        
	The restaurants interior appears to be styled after fast food joints the world over, but the menu is careful not to call its signature fare a hamburger  lest it give the impression North Koreans had embraced the American icon. The minced beef and bread at the new fast food restaurant costs only $1.70, the newspaper said, but that would eat up nearly half of the average North Koreans daily income. In 2007, South Koreas central bank put the average per capita income at $1,150.

                                                                                                                                          Civilians cowered in hospital beds today and refugees looted UN supplies  all of them desperate for relief from the fighting that has engulfed a northwestern valley as troops and warplanes try to drive out Taliban militants.                 The formula for restoring national confidence  part good policy, part good politics, part good luck  can be hard to find.                   A White House military aide who authorised an Air Force flyover of New York that caused panic among some people in the city resigned yesterday.                   The nuclear physicist husband of Bangladeshi Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina died today at a Dhaka hospital.

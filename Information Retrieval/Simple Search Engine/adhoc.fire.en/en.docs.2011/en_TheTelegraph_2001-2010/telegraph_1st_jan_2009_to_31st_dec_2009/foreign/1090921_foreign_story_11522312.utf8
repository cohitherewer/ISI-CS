                              Kevin Rudd: Talk trouble                            
	Melbourne, Sept. 20 (PTI): Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd has defended the use of expletive-laden tirade at Labour Party colleagues during a private meeting over MPs perks as robust conversation and said it was consistent with the traditions of countrys politics.         
	The Prime Minister had used f..k several times in one sentence to illustrate a point during a meeting with Australian Labour Party factional leaders who wanted him to change his mind about cutting back on MPs printing allowances which were running into millions of dollars a year.         
	When asked about the conversation, Rudd, who is in New York to attend the G20 summit, said: I think its fair to say that consistent with the traditions of the Australian Labour Party, were given to robust conversations. I made my point of view absolutely clear, that is that these entitlements needed to be cut back.

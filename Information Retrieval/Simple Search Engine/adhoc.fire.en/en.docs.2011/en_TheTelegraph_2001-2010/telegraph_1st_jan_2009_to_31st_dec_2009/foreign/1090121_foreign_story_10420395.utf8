The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | One day, if she has a family, shell describe history
                                                                                                               One day, if she has a family, shell describe history
                      
	They came by car, by train, by plane, by subway, by foot. Barack Obama rsquo;s inauguration brought together Americans of all ages and backgrounds, from all 
  corners of the country. All converged on Washington DC for an event that meant so much collectively, yet was different for each individual.

	JAMES JONES  
	Jones, a retired Pennsylvania schoolteacher and police officer who took a bus to Martin Luther King Jrs I Have a Dream speech 46 years ago, returned to Washington on Tuesday to see his own dream come true.        
	Last May, when Barack Obama was still battling Hillary Clinton for the Democratic nomination, Jones wrote to the local Senator: I am a 73-year-old Black Man who participated in the civil rights movement. History will be made when Barack Obama will be the Democratic presidential candidate. History will be made again for he will win in November. Will you PLEASE see that I get two tickets to attend this history-making event.        
	It took a while, but Jones got the call about two weeks ago: the tickets were his.         
	Tuesdays trip had a resonance for Jones that few can claim. One day in August 1963 he left his wife and kids at home and boarded a bus in Philadelphia for the March on Washington. There, he recalled: I heard a gentleman say, I have a dream.        
	We were way, way back, he said. We could see the Washington Monument, but not Martin Luther King.

	CLASSY HALL        
	Classy, a 13-year-old girl, wore a long, blue gown with silvery sparkles for the inauguration. A bridal shop donated the dress and her California school raised her airfare.        
	She flew to Washington on Saturday to meet hundreds of other students chosen by the People to People Ambassadors Program, an organisation that offers educational travel opportunities to school students, to attend the inauguration. I want to become a part of history and witness things others cant, said Classy.        
	And yes, she has a ball, a special one set up by the program, to attend. To complete the look of her new dress, Classy got her hair done in a doughnut bun before leaving California.        
	To help her with the airfare, the school held a fundraiser in the cafe: her mom made ribs and there was spaghetti from a local restaurant. One day, if she has a family of her own, shell be able to describe history to them, said her mother Nakia.

	A Massachusetts social worker, Wingards volunteer work for Obama turned into a passion.        
	With roads closed and public transportation stretched to the limit, the only option the 66-year-old had on Tuesday was good old shoe leather. Wingard walked the 13km from the rented apartment she and a friend found on the Internet.        
	The 66-year-old didnt complain. A social worker in Connecticut public schools until she retired three years ago, Wingard had also campaigned for Massachusetts governor Deval Patrick, who became only the second African-American to be elected governor in the US in 2005.        
	Hearing Barack Obama early in his campaign, Wingard was transfixed. It wasnt just what he said, she recalled. It was the character, intelligence and integrity of the man.        
	On election night, she gathered with other volunteers in a small storefront campaign office in Springfield, Massachusetts, with pizzas and chicken, beer and wine. When you really win, its like, WOW, she said.

	LYNDA JOHNSON ROBB        
	Shes the daughter of a man who was President, Vice-President, Senator and Congressman, and the wife of a man who was governor and Senator. That adds up to a whole lot of inaugurations that Lynda Johnson Robb, 64, has attended in her lifetime.         
	But somehow that hadnt dulled the excitement for Robb, the daughter of Lyndon B. Johnson. So she packed up some handwarmers and footwarmers and a trusty old muff, and made her way to the Capitol.         
	After that? Ill get on the Metro and go home, said Robb, who lives in nearby Virginia.        
	Inaugurations still hold a sense of magic for Robb, whos been on the podium four times. The most memorable: the swearing-in of her father as President in 1965. I was 20 going on 21. I was seated next to mom, in the front row.         
	What a great seat.

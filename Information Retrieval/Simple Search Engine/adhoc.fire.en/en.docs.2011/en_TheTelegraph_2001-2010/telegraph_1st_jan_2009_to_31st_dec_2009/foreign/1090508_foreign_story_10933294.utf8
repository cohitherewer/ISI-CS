The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Troops close in on Tigers
                                                                                                               Troops close in on Tigers
                            
	Colombo, May 7 (PTI): Sri Lankan forces today fought their way to just 800 meters from an area where 10,000-15,000 Tamil civilians are trapped with top LTTE leaders.        
	They also breached a Tiger fortification and killed a number of rebels.        
	In Colombo, President Mahinda Rajapaksa said the war was nearing the end. He promised Colombo-based foreign diplomats that once Tamil Tigers were dismantled, his government proposed to bring democracy to the northern part of the island.        
	Troops pushed into the rebel-held village of Karayamulliavaikkal, advancing over areas heavily mined by the Tigers and fighting off attacks from their suicide bombers.        
	A military spokesman said the troops broke through the last earthen defences, bringing them within 800 meters of an area in Mullaitivu where top LTTE leaders are holed up with Tamil civilians.        
	The spokesman said the Tigers are deploying suicide bombers in large numbers to slow down the advancing troops.         
	Military sources said between 500 to 1,000 hardcore Black Tiger commandos have formed a last wall of defence around Tiger chief Velupillai Prabhakaran.        
	After the fighting, bodies of three LTTE rebels were found. Troops also uncovered a huge cache of assault rifles and radio communication sets.         
	LTTE rebels are desperately attempting to hold the security forces advance by launching indiscriminate firing and using their heavy weapons mounted in the No Fire Zone, the defence ministry said quoting military officials. Foreign minister Rohitha Bogollagama said more pressure must be brought on the LTTE by the international community.

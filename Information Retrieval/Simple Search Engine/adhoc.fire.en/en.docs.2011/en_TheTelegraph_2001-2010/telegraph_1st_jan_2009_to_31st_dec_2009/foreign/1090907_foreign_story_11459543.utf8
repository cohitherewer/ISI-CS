The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | 9/11 fells Obama adviser
                                                                                                               9/11 fells Obama adviser
                              Van Jones                            
	Washington, Sept. 6 (Reuters): A White House environmental policy adviser who specialised in green jobs resigned today after an uproar over his previous affiliation with a 9/11 conspiracy group.        
	Van Jones, special adviser on green jobs at the White House Council on Environmental Quality, apologised on Thursday after videotape surfaced of him using a crude epithet to describe Republicans and amid revelations he had signed a petition suggesting US government involvement in the 2001 attacks.        
	The apology did little to quell Republican criticism. President Barack Obamas chief spokesperson gave only tepid support to the adviser.        
	Jones said he was resigning to avoid being a distraction in the administrations effort to pass healthcare reform and climate change legislation.

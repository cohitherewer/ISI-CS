The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | US pilots heroism years in the making
                                                                                                               US pilots heroism years in the making
          RAY RIVERA                          Sullenberger: Selfless                                  
	New York, Jan. 17: Captain Chesley B. Sullenberger III had just performed a flying miracle. But there he stood, calmly, inside the glass waiting room at the New York Waterway terminal on Pier 79, speaking to police. His fine grey hair was unruffled, and his navy blue pilots uniform had barely a wrinkle.        
	His tie wasnt even loosened, said deputy mayor Edward Skyler.        
	Michael Balboni, state deputy secretary for public safety, shook the pilots hand and thanked him for a job done brilliantly: the precise, soft, life-saving landing of a 50-tonne jetliner in the Hudson river.        
	He said to me in the most unaffected, humble way, Thats what were trained to do, Balboni said. No boasting, no emotion, no nothing.        
	Heroes are often born in an instant, the split second it takes to recognise a pending disaster and react, the blink of an eye it takes one to throw himself under a subway train to save a man fallen on the tracks.        
	In the case of Sullenberger, the 57-year-old pilot of US Airways Flight 1549, it was years in the making.        
	He had been with the airline for nearly 30 years and was steeped in the safety side of the industry. He had worked with officials investigating crashes and improving training and methods for evacuating aircraft in emergencies.        
	He got his pilots licence as a teenager, flew F-4 Phantoms for the air force and was a 1973 graduate of the Air Force Academy, where he received the Outstanding Cadet in Airmanship Award, given to the top flier in each graduating class. He even flew gliders, which is sort of what he was left with Thursday when something, perhaps birds, knocked out both engines in his Airbus A320 that had 155 people on board.        
	Sullenbergers efforts, such as twice checking the soaked cabin for stragglers before fleeing the sinking plane himself, emerged as singularly selfless leadership of a sort that seemed so removed from things like subprime mortgages, corporate bailouts and deflected blame.        
	Passenger Nick Gamache, a software salesman, said the pilot had been the picture of calm.        
	I mean, he was directing people to get on the raft, Gamache said. Then I saw him in the terminal. Thats where I was like, Thank you, you just saved all our lives.        
	Sullenberger has been a boon for an airline that has filed for bankruptcy twice in recent years and been plagued by publicity nightmares. Two Christmases ago, US Airways lost 75,000 bags, some not found for months. Last year it became the first carrier to charge for coffee, tea and bottled water.        
	Sullenberger fielded congratulatory phone calls from President George Bush and President-elect Barack Obama, but mostly stayed secluded somewhere in the city. He did not attend a ceremony at City Hall, where Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg said his actions inspired people around the city, and millions more around the world.

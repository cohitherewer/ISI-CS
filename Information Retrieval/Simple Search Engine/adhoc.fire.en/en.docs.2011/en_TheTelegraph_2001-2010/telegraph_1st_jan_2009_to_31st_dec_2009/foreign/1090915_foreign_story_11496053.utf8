The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Hear my words, warns Obama
                                                                                                               Hear my words, warns Obama
                              Obama in New York. (Reuters)                            
	New York, Sept. 14 (AP): President Barack Obama sternly warned Wall Street today against returning to the sort of reckless and unchecked behaviour that threatened the US with a second Great Depression like the one in the 1930s.        
	Even as he noted that the US economy and financial system were pulling out of a downward spiral, Obama warned financial titans today  the first anniversary of the Lehman Brothers collapse  that they could not count on any more bailouts.        
	He credited his administration and the $787 billion stimulus package rammed through Congress in the first days of his taking office for pulling the country back from the brink. We can be confident that the storms of the past two years are beginning to break, he said.        
	And even as the economy begins a return to normalcy, Obama said: Normalcy cannot lead to complacency.        
	Nevertheless, Obama said: Instead of learning the lessons of Lehman and the crisis from which we are still recovering, they are choosing to ignore them.        
	His tough message warned the financial community to hear my words: We will not go back to the days of reckless behaviour and unchecked excess at the heart of this crisis, where too many were motivated only by the appetite for quick kills and bloated bonuses.        
	Obama spoke at the Federal Hall in the heart of Wall Street before an audience that included members of the financial community, lawmakers and top administration officials.         
	He planned to have lunch with former President Bill Clinton after the speech, before returning to Washington. Administration officials would not disclose any details of the luncheon discussion.        
	In marking his determination to prevent a repeat of the crisis that nearly brought down the global financial system last autumn, Obama said he was attacking the problem on several broad fronts.        
	This included new rules to protect consumers and a new Consumer Financial Protection Agency to enforce those rules and closure of regulator loopholes and overlap that were at the heart of the crisis because it left key officials without the authority to take action.        
	At the Pittsburgh G-20 economic meeting later this month, the US will focus on ways to spur global demand but also to address the underlying problems that caused such a deep and lasting global recession, Obama said.        
	The President and others seeking ways to better monitor the financial system and to police the products banks sell to consumers have been opposed by lobbyists, lawmakers and turf-protecting regulators.        
	Mergers and sales of banks have consolidated lending power in even fewer hands. And those large firms still bet far more than the capital they have on hand. Yet regulations have not moved. Much of the legislative motivation in Washington has been consumed by the contentious debate over changes to the health care system.         
	Government intervention into private automakers such as General Motors have left lawmakers skittish to move further into corporate board rooms. And its not as if another collapse is obviously imminent.

	Depp mirror    
	 London, July 1: Despite his millions of admiring fans, actor Johnny Depp has claimed he hates looking in the mirror, reports The Daily Telegraph.       
	Depp, 46, who is promoting his latest movie Public Enemies, said in London that he has not seen himself in the film.      
	The actor stars as John Dillinger, the charismatic bank robber whose raids made him the number one target of J. Edgar Hoovers fledgling FBI.      
	Speaking after the films European premiere in London, Depp said: If I could avoid a mirror when I brush my teeth in the morning, I would. I find security and safety in the most profound degree of ignorance.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Obama signals Tehran 
                                                                                                               Obama signals Tehran 
  - Iran told to unclench fist message over Arab TV                             Footage of Obamas interview with Al Arabiya in Washington on Monday. (AP)                                  
	Dubai, Jan. 27 (Reuters): President Barack Obama said the time was ripe for Israel and Palestine to resume peace talks and that America was prepared to extend a hand of peace to Iran if it unclenched its fist.        
	Choosing an Arab television station to broadcast his first formal TV interview as President, Obama also sought to heal US ties with the Arab and Muslim world, telling them Americans are not your enemy.        
	It is impossible for us to think only in terms of the Palestinian-Israeli conflict and not think in terms of whats happening with Syria or Iran or Lebanon or Afghanistan and Pakistan, Obama told the Al Arabiya channel.        
	On Iran, Obama said he believed it was important to use all the tools of US power with Tehran, including diplomacy.        
	It is important for us to be willing to talk to Iran, to express very clearly where our differences are, but (also) where there are potential avenues for progress, he said. If countries like Iran are willing to unclench their fist, they will find an extended hand from us.        
	Obama said he had begun to meet his campaign vows by naming former Senator George Mitchell as West Asia envoy. Sending George Mitchell to the Middle East is fulfilling my campaign promise that were not going to wait until the end of my administration to deal with Palestinian and Israeli peace. Were going to start now, Obama said.        
	Obama said his administration wanted to begin by listening and talking to those involved without prejudging their concerns.        
	We cannot tell either the Israelis or the Palestinians what is best for them... They are going to have to make some decisions, Obama said.        
	But I do believe that the moment is ripe for both sides to realise that the path that they are on is one that is not going to result in prosperity and security for their people. And that instead, its time to return to the negotiating table.        
	Obama praised Saudi King Abdullah for the Saudi-sponsored peace initiative, which offers Arab peace to Israel in exchange for its withdrawal from Arab land occupied since 1967 and a just solution for Palestinian refugees.        
	I might not agree with every aspect of the proposal, but it took great courage to put forward something that is as significant as that, Obama said. I think that there are ideas across the region of how we might pursue peace.        
	Noting that he has lived in Muslim countries and has Muslim family members, Obama said: My job to the Muslim world is to communicate that the Americans are not your enemy.

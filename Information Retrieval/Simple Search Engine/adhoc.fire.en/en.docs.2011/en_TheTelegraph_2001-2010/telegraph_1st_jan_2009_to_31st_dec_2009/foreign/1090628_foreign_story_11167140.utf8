	Los Angeles, June 27: As Hollywood reacted with sadness and shock to the death of Michael Jackson, Sony executives in New York were on the phone all night on Thursday with Jacksons advisers trying to understand the financial morass the pop star is leaving behind.        
	Its all a mess, said one executive involved in Jacksons financial affairs who spoke on the condition of anonymity out of respect for the entertainers family. No one really knows what is going on, but these are early days.        
	Jacksons business life, like his public life, was a perplexing mass of contradictions. Unlike many performers, he was a keen negotiator and shrewd investor  in 1985 he pulled off one of the great deals in music business history when he bought the publishing rights to the Beatles catalogue for $47.5 million.         
	Today it is part of a larger collection of songs worth more than $1 billion, and owned in partnership with Sony.         
	But his personal finances, at least in recent years, were perpetually in tatters, as he burned through millions of dollars to maintain his Neverland ranch, go on art-buying sprees and indulge in whimsies like travelling with a pet chimpanzee named Bubbles.         
	And he burned through financial advisers almost as swiftly, with a revolving door of characters coming in and out of his life.        
	Michael never thought his personal finances were out of control, said Alvin Malnik, a former adviser to Jackson who is the godfather of Prince Michael II, the youngest of his three children. He never kept track of what he was spending. He would indiscriminately charter jets. He would buy paintings for $1.5 million. You couldnt do that every other week and expect your books to balance.        
	The big question now is what happens to his assets. So far, that is unclear even to Jacksons closest representatives, several of whom were hired only weeks ago, in Jacksons latest round of managerial housecleaning.        
	They say it could take years to sort through the financial and legal mess left after the singers death, not to mention millions of dollars worth of tickets sold for a series of 50 concerts Jackson had planned in London.         
	Malnik, for example, said that in 2004 he agreed to be the executor of Jacksons estate. I said yes, but I never inquired further, and I dont know whats happened since then, he said. Malnik said there was still a chance that he was an executor, but had not heard anything since the death. Other advisers said that Jackson left behind at least two wills.        
	It is also unclear how much would be left for any heirs. It has been estimated that Jackson earned about $700 million as a performer and songwriter from the 1980s on, much of it spent. And his debts have been estimated at $400 million to $500 million.         
	His single biggest asset is a 50 per cent share in Sony/ATV Music Publishing  which owns the rights to more than 200 Beatles songs, along with thousands of others  valued at more than $500 million, but he has about $300 million of debt against it held by Barclays, Jacksons biggest creditor.         
	He also owns his own publishing catalogue, called Mijac, which is estimated to be worth $50 million to $100 million, and has an unknown amount of debt attached.        
	In late 2005, while Jackson was living in West Asia after being acquitted of child molestation, his finances were particularly precarious. Sony then negotiated a deal with the singer that resulted in Jackson paying a lower interest rate on his debt in return for Sony gaining more authority to operate Sony/ATV and the option to buy half of Jacksons share.         
	One question Sony executives have now is with whom they will negotiate. Jacksons share is owned by a trust that he set up around the time of his molestation trial in 2005; people close to the situation say that his mother, Katherine, now controls it.         
	Jacksons investment in song catalogues was no accident. Contrary to his popular image as a naf, he took an active interest in the wider music business, associates say, with a shrewdness he inherited from his father, who shaped the careers of Michael and his brothers. Martin Bandier, chairman and chief executive of Sony/ATV, said that Michael Jackson had a keen sense of the value of music copyrights.

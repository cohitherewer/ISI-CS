                              Silent on father                            
	Los Angeles, Oct. 2 (PTI): Actress, author and model Padma Lakshmi has confirmed her pregnancy calling it a miracle, but denied reports that lawyer Manu Nathan is the father of the child.        
	The 39-year-old Top Chef hosts representative refused to reveal the identity of the father, adding that Lakshmi was overjoyed with the news as she had been struggling with a disease called endometriosis which causes infertility, reports Us magazine .        
	Lakshmi had sparked pregnancy rumours when she appeared on the Emmy red carpet last month in a clinging purple dress which revealed a baby bump. Reports had suggested that Nathan was the father.         
	However, Lakshmis representative said that he was her cousin, not boyfriend.

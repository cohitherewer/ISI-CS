	150yrs of Big Ben    
	London, May 29 (AP): Defiantly low-tech yet accurate to the second, Big Ben is having its 150th birthday on Sunday, its Victorian chimes carrying the sound of Britain into the 21st Century.      
	Its a birthday the world can share in. The peals of Londons favourite clock are carried globally by BBC radio, and its 314-foot-high tower, roughly 16 stories, is the citys most famous landmark.       
	Catherine Moss, who took journalists on a pre-anniversary tour, said that in one year as a Big Ben guide, she had climbed the height of Everest three times over.

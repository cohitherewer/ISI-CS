The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Cancer link in heavy phone use, says study
                                                                                                               Cancer link in heavy phone use, says study

	London, Oct. 24: Long-term use of mobile phones may be linked to some cancers, a landmark international study will conclude later this year.        
	 A 20 million, decade-long investigation overseen by the World Health Organisation will publish evidence that heavy users face a higher risk of developing brain tumours later in life, The Daily Telegraph can disclose.        
	The conclusion, while not definitive, will undermine assurances from the government that the devices are safe and is expected to put ministers under pressure to issue stronger guidance. A breakdown of the results found a significantly increased risk of some brain tumours related to use of mobile phones for a period of 10 years or more in some studies.        
	The head of the Interphone investigation said that the report would include a public health message. Britains department of health has not updated its guidance for more than four years. It says that the current balance of evidence does not show health problems caused by using mobile phones, and suggests only that children be discouraged from making non-essential calls while adults should keep calls short.        
	In contrast, several other countries, notably France, have begun strengthening warnings and American politicians are urgently investigating the risks. The Interphone inquiry has been investigating whether exposure to mobile phones is linked to three types of brain tumour.        
	Its head, Dr Elisabeth Cardis, backed new warnings. In the absence of definitive results and in the light of a number of studies which, though limited, suggest a possible effect of radiofrequency radiation, precautions are important, she said.        
	I am, therefore, globally in agreement with the idea of restricting the use by children, though I would not go as far as banning mobile phones as they can be a very important tool, not only in emergencies, but also maintaining contact between children and their parents.

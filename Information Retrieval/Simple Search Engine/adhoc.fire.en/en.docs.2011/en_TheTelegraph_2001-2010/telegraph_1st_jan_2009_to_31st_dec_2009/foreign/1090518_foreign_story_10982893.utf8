	Pretty good    
	 London, May 17: Pretty women and handsome men are paid more than their less good-looking counterparts because they are worth it, claim scientists.       
	Researchers discovered attractive people get paid better and rise higher up the corporate ladder than less good-looking colleagues of equal ability, reports The Sunday Telegraph.       
	But they believe it may not be simply down to bosses lusting after beautiful members of staff, it may actually be because they are easier to work with and better educated.       
	Psychologists think good-looking employees are often more confident as a result of their attractiveness and therefore shine and stand out in the office. It also leads to them being better qualified.

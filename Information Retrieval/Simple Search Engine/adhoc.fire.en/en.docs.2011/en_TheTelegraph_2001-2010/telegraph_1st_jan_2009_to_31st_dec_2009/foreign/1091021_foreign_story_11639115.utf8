                                                                                                               Iran seeks hunt nod 
                            
	Tehran, Oct. 20 (Reuters): A senior Iranian Revolutionary Guards commander today said his force should be given permission to hunt down terrorists inside Pakistan, state television reported.        
	The report, which did not give any direct quotes, said the commander of the Guards ground forces, Mohammad Pakpour, called for the issuing of necessary permissions allowing the Guards to confront terrorists on Pakistani soil. It did not give details or specify whether he was referring to authorisation for such an operation from the Pakistani government, or from Iranian authorities.        
	Iran says the Sunni rebel group Jundollah (Gods soldiers), which has claimed a suicide bombing in southeastern Iran that killed 42 people on Sunday, operates from across the border in Pakistan. The attack killed several senior Guards commanders.        
	Guards commander-in-chief Mohammad Ali Jafari said yesterday Jundollah had ties with US, British and Pakistani intelligence organisations. Yesterday, an Iranian MP also raised the prospect of a possible cross-border military operation into Pakistan against the militants. There is unanimity about the Revolutionary Guards and the security forces engaging in operations in any place they would deem necessary, Isna news agency said.

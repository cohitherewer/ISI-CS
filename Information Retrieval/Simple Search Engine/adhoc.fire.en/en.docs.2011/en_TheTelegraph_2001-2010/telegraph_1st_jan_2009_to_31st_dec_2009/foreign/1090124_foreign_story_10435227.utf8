	Dendermonde (Belgium), Jan. 23 (Reuters): A man with a white painted face and blackened eyes fatally stabbed two infants and a woman at a child care centre in western Belgium today before cycling away.        
	Eleven other children and two other women workers were wounded and being treated at local hospitals, authorities said. Three of the children were in a critical condition.        
	The assailant arrived at the creche at around 0900GMT saying he wanted to ask a question, but then leapt into one of the rooms to launch his attack before stabbing more victims in another room. The man cycled away before being arrested at around 11.30am.        
	The creche, in the town of Dendermonde, 30km west of Brussels, held 18 children aged up to 3 years and 6 adults at the time.        
	Belgian media said that the man in his 30s was a psychiatric patient, but authorities did not confirm this, saying only that he would appear before a magistrate later today. Many parents are in shock, interior minister Guido De Padt told a news conference.        
	Hospitals had made photos of the wounded available to concerned parents to help them find their children.         
	Christian Du Four, a local prosecutor, said in the mayhem that ensued the attacker simply walked out and got on his bicycle before being arrested in a nearby supermarket shortly after the attack.        
	We have three people dead and 10 in various hospitals, Du Four said. People are totally in shock, said Leene Du Bois, a spokeswoman for the regional government of Flanders.

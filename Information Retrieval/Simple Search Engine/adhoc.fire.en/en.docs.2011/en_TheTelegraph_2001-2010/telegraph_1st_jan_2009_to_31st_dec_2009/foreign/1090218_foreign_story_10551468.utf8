	 London, Feb. 17 (PTI): Actor-turned-rapper Joaquin Phoenix said his movie career will become insignificant when he becomes a famous rapper like Eminem.      
	The Walk The Line star announced his plans to quit acting and concentrate on a career in music, despite criticism and claims this news is just a hoax. The 34-year-old actor told in an interview to Wenn that his rap career has been brewing for a long time and he has flirted with the idea of quitting acting. But, learning to play the guitar for his film Walk The Line was the catalyst for Phoenix to give up his movie career.       
	Ive always loved music and never really played anything, after Walk The Line, I kind of learned to play guitar that certainly opened the door for me for music.

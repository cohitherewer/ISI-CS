  - US said to have set deadline, Pak President silent on key demand                            Protesting lawyers in Rawalpindi. (AFP)                                  
	Islamabad, March 13 (Agencies): Pakistans embattled government considered cutting a deal with the Opposition after being served a 24-hour ultimatum by the US, media reports said.        
	President Asif Ali Zardari is said to have decided to lift governors rule in Punjab and allow Nawaz Sharifs party to form the government in the province, under pressure from the US, the UK and the Pakistan Army.        
	The News daily reported that the US had put Zardari on notice and given him a 24-hour ultimatum to ease the political crisis in Pakistan. The report came amid speculation that the deal brokered by Washington and the UK in consultation with the Army had been conveyed to the government.        
	Gilani was given 24 hours to convince Zardari into agreeing to the new political and constitutional arrangement, The News said.         
	The deal was aimed at resolving the standoff between the ruling Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) and Sharifs Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz.         
	After holding back-to-back meetings with Prime Minister Yousaf Raza Gilani and army chief General Ashfaq Parvez Kayani, Zardari was ready in principle to end governors rule in Punjab, the reports said.        
	The governors rule was imposed on February 25 after the supreme court barred Nawaz and Shahbaz Sharif from holding elected office.        
	 Zardari also decided to let Punjab governor Salman Taseer convene the provincial Assembly so that it could elect a new leader of the House from the single largest party, the PML-N, Dawn News channel quoted sources as saying. But there has been no official word.         
	It was unclear how much impact the deal would have on resolving the dispute because it does not address the movements main concern  the restoration of independent-minded judges that many believe could be hostile to Zardari.        
	Government sources said some relief could be provided to the Sharif brothers with regard to the court order barring them from contesting polls or holding elected office.         
	Zardari had been accused of influencing the court verdict.        
	Early today, police stopped about 200 lawyers in a convoy of cars and buses from entering Sindh province en route to Islamabad as part of what is being called the long march. No arrests were made.        
	Turnout at many of the gatherings has been relatively small  a few hundred people at most. Activists said the arrests have forced many people underground and expect far larger crowds when people gather in Punjab on Sunday.        
	The government has hauled in shipping containers to barricade roads leading to the capital and all routes to the parliament building.        
	Geo TV blocked        
	Pakistan private news channel Geo TV said on its website that its telecast was blocked in some parts of the country.

          RACHEL L. SWARNS                                                  
	Washington, Jan. 10: Over the years, several Presidents have been forced to ponder the delicate (and sometimes unpleasant) question of whether to move the in-laws into the White House.         
	Ulysses S. Grant shared space with his father-in-law, who grumbled and squabbled with other relatives, historians say. Harry S. Truman lived with his mother-in-law, who declared that she knew dozens of men better qualified to preside over the Oval Office.         
	Yesterday, the transition team of President-elect Barack Obama confirmed that his 71-year-old mother-in-law would be moving, at least temporarily, into the grand residence at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue. While Grant and Truman might have been forgiven for gritting their teeth at such a prospect, Obama has said he will be delighted to have his wifes mother, Marian Robinson, join the first family in Washington.        
	After all, Robinson, known as a loving, tough-minded matriarch who rarely shies from speaking her mind, has been the bedrock of the Obama family. During the presidential campaign, she retired from her job as a bank secretary to care for the Obama girls, Malia, 10, and Sasha, 7, while their parents were on the road.         
	She accompanied them to school and piano and dance lessons, cooked their meals, ran their baths and put them to bed. And she is expected to continue to play a critical role in the familys effort to keep the girls lives as normal as possible.        
	But while Robinson has been the family mainstay, she has also prized her independence. She chose to work as a secretary, though her parents had preferred that she become a teacher. She ran the 50- and 100-yard dashes in the Illinois senior games when she was well into her 60s.                         Robinson: Matriarch      
	And she has often teased her daughter, Michelle Obama, and the President-elect about their household rules for her granddaughters.        
	Bedtime at 8:30pm? Thats ridiculous, Robinson told The Boston Globe last year, suggesting that was too early.        
	Television for only an hour? Thats just not enough time, she said.        
	As for the healthy, organic foods the Obamas favour? Thats not my thing, said Robinson, who said she enjoyed salty fried foods and dismissed efforts to make such dishes healthier. If youre going to have fried chicken, she said, have fried chicken.         
	 Robinson even initially opposed Obamas plan to run for President, though she soon became one of his biggest supporters. She was very afraid for his safety, said Craig Robinson, the older brother of Michelle Obama.         
	And Robinson is so deeply rooted in Chicago and in the brick bungalow where she has lived for decades that Obama seemed uncertain until recently that she would make the move.        
	Shes just been an unbelievable support for all of us during this process, Obama said on 60 Minutes after he was elected President. She likes her own space, you know, he continued. She doesnt like a lot of fuss around her. And, like it or not, theres some fuss in the White House. But we hope that she comes.        
	The White House is a world away from the working-class black neighbourhood on the South Side of Chicago where Robinson and her late husband, Fraser Robinson, raised their two children to succeed.

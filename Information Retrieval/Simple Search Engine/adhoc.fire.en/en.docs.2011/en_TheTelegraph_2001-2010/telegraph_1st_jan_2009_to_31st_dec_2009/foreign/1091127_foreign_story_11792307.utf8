The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | At 3, worry about weight
                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      At 3, worry about weight
                            
	London, Nov. 26: Girls begin worrying about their appearance and weight from the age of three, a study has found.        
	 Research among pre-school girls found that up to 50 per cent were already anxious about how they look while a third wanted to lose weight or change their hair colour.        
	But exposure to images of idealised beauty, such as princesses in films, does not appear to make their anxiety worse. Researchers based at the University of Central Florida asked a group of girls aged between three and six a series of questions about their body image before showing them extracts of cartoons featuring female characters.        
	The idea was to assess whether stereotypically thin princess characters, even in cartoons, were making girls worry about their body even before they start school. Almost a third (31 per cent) said that they almost always worried about their appearance while another 18 per cent disclosed that they sometimes did so. We do need to help our children challenge the images of beauty that they see and idolise and encourage them to question how much appearance should be part of their self-worth, said Prof. Stacey Tantleff-Dunn, who led the study.

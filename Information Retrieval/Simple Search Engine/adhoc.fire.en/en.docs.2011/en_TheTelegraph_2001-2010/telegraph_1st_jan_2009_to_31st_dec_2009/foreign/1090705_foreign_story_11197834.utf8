The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Iran: Reformers confess to plot
                                                                                                               Iran: Reformers confess to plot

	Cairo, July 4: Iranian leaders say they have obtained confessions from top reformist officials that they plotted to bring down the government with a velvet revolution.         
	Such confessions, almost always extracted under duress, are part of an effort to recast the civil unrest set off by Irans disputed presidential election as a conspiracy orchestrated by foreign nations, human rights groups say.        
	Reports on Iranian websites associated with prominent conservatives said that leading reformers have confessed to taking velvet revolution training courses outside the country. Alef, a website of a conservative MP, referred to a video of Mohammad Ali Abtahi, who served as vice-president in the reform government of former President Mohammed Khatami, as showing that he tearfully welcomed being defrocked and has confessed to provoking people, causing tension and creating media chaos.         
	Ayatollah Ali Khameneis representative to the Revolutionary Guards, Mojtaba Zolnour, said in a speech on Thursday that almost everyone now detained had confessed  raising the prospect that more confessions will be made public. Ayatollah Khamenei is the supreme religious leader.         
	The government has made it a practice to publicise confessions from political prisoners held without charge or legal representation, often subjected to pressure tactics like sleep deprivation, solitary confinement and torture, according to human rights groups and former political prisoners.

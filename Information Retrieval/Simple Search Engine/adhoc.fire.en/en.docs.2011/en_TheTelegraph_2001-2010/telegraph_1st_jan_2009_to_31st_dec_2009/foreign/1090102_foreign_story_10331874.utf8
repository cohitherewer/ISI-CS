The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Israel kills Hamas leader
                                                                                                               Israel kills Hamas leader
                            
	Gaza, Jan. 1 (Reuters): Israel killed a senior Hamas leader in an air attack on his home today, striking its first deadly blow against the top ranks of the Islamist group in a Gaza offensive that has claimed more than 400 Palestinian lives.        
	Nizar Rayyan, a cleric widely regarded as one of Hamass most hardline political leaders, had called for renewed suicide bombings inside Israel. Medical officials, confirming his death, said another nine people, including members of Rayyans family, were killed in the bombing in Jabalya refugee camp.        
	Many Hamas leaders are in hiding, anticipating assassination attempts by Israel, whose military confirmed the air strike. Hamas Radio said Rayyan rejected Hamass advice to leave his house.        
	Rayyan, 49, an influential preacher at what is known in Jabalya as the mosque of martyrs mentored suicide bombers and with an ammunition belt strapped to his stocky frame, would patrol with Hamas fighters.        
	The blood of Sheikh Nizar Rayyan and the blood of other martyrs will never be wasted and the enemy will pay a heavy price for the crimes it committed, said Hamas official Ayman Taha.        
	Hours before the killing, Israel Prime Minister Ehud Olmert said his country was fighting Hamas with an iron fist.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Texting at wheel biggest crash risk
                                                                                                               Texting at wheel biggest crash risk
          MATT RICHTEL                          Dangerous distraction                                  
	New York, July 28: The first study of drivers texting inside their vehicles shows that the risk sharply exceeds previous estimates based on laboratory research  and far surpasses the dangers of other driving distractions.        
	The new study, which entailed outfitting the cabs of long-haul trucks with video cameras over 18 months, found that when the drivers texted, their collision risk was 23 times greater than when not texting.        
	The Virginia Tech Transportation Institute, which compiled the research and plans to release its findings on Tuesday, also measured the time drivers took their eyes from the road to send or receive texts.         
	In the moments before a crash or near crash, drivers typically spent nearly five seconds looking at their devices  enough time at typical highway speeds to cover more than the length of a football field.        
	Even though trucks take longer to stop and are less manoeuvrable than cars, the findings generally applied to all drivers, who tend to exhibit the same behaviours as the more than 100 truckers studied, the researchers said.         
	Truckers, they said, do not appear to text more or less than typical car drivers, but they said the study did not compare use patterns that way. Compared with other sources of driver distraction, texting is in its own universe of risk, said Rich Hanowski, who oversaw the study at the institute.        
	Hanowski said the texting analysis was financed by $300,000 from the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration, which has the mission of improving safety in trucks and buses. More broadly, the research yielding the results represent a significant logistical undertaking.         
	The overall cost was $6 million to equip the trucks with video cameras and track them for three million miles as they hauled furniture, frozen foods and other goods across the country. The final analysis of the data is undergoing peer review before formal publication.        
	Tom Dingus, director of the Virginia Tech institute, one of the worlds largest vehicle safety research organisations, said the studys message was clear. You should never do this, he said of texting while driving. It should be illegal.        
	Thirty-six states do not ban texting while driving; 14 do, including Alaska, California, Louisiana and New Jersey. New York legislators have sent a bill to Governor David A. Paterson. But legislators in some states have rejected such rules, and elected officials say they need more data to determine whether to ban the activity.        
	One difficulty in measuring crashes caused by texting drivers  and by drivers talking on phones  is that many police agencies do not collect this data or have not compiled long-term studies. Texting also is a relatively new phenomenon.

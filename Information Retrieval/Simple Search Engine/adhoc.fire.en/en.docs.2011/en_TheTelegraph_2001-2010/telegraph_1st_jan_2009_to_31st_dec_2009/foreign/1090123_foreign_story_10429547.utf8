	Shijiazhuang (China), Jan. 22 (Reuters): A Chinese court today sentenced two men to death for their role in a tainted milk scandal that killed at least six children, while the woman most widely blamed for the tragedy got life in jail.        
	Nearly 300,000 children fell ill last year after drinking milk intentionally laced with melamine, a toxic industrial compound that can give a fake positive on protein tests.        
	The latest in a string of food safety failures that have blighted the made in China brand, the Sanlu milk scandal was also one of the worst and prompted an outpouring of public anger. Sanlu officials were aware of the melamine problem by early August but the public was not warned until mid-September as China strove to put on a perfect face for the Beijing Olympics.        
	Authorities may have timed the sentencing today to try and tame outrage ahead of Chinas most important holiday.         
	The closely watched trial of middlemen and executives from the Sanlu Group, a now bankrupt firm that had failed to report cases of infants getting sick from drinking its products, wrapped up just before the Lunar New Year.        
	A handful of parents travelled to the gritty industrial town of Shijiazhuang and waited for hours in the freezing cold  at a time when most of the country is planning family reunions  to hear what justice their children would get.        
	Spring Festival is coming up, but what happiness is there for us? said Hou Rongbo, whose son died in early January just a week before his first birthday. Hou believes his death from a leukaemia was caused or worsened by melamine that also gave him kidney stones.        
	Many families have focused their anger on Sanlus former general manager, Tian Wenhua, and felt betrayed that she would not face execution. Tian pleaded guilty late last year to charges that do not carry the death sentence. She should have been shot, said Zheng Shuzhen, a 48-year-old who said her granddaughter died in June of kidney failure after drinking Sanlu milk formula.

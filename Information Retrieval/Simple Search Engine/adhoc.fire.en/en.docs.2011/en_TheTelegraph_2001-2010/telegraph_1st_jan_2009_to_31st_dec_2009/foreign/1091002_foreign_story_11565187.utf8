	Beijing, Oct. 1 (Reuters): China celebrated its wealth and rising might with a show of goose-stepping troops, gaudy floats and nuclear-capable missiles in Beijing today, 60 years after Mao Zedong proclaimed its embrace of communism.        
	Tiananmen Square in central Beijing became a high-tech stage to celebrate the birth of the Peoples Republic of China on October 1, 1949, with the Communist Party leadership and guests watching a meticulously disciplined show of national confidence.        
	Celebrations began in the morning with troops firing cannons and raising the red national flag while President Hu Jintao, wearing a slate grey Mao suit, looked on from the Gate of Heavenly Peace over the Square.        
	Hu descended to Beijings main thoroughfare and inspected rows of troops, riding past them in a black limousine and bellowing repeatedly,Hello comrades, hard-working comrades!        
	From here it was that Chairman Mao solemnly announced the founding of the Peoples Republic of China, and from then the Chinese people stood up, Hu told the guests and troops. Today a socialist China embracing modernisation, embracing the world and embracing the future stands lofty and firm.        
	The two-hour parade of 8,000 soldiers, tanks and missiles, 60 elaborate floats and 100,000 well-drilled civilians was a proud moment for many Chinese citizens, watching the spectacle across the country on television. I am very proud of the military today. You can see we are getting stronger and stronger as a nation, said Qiu Chengjie.

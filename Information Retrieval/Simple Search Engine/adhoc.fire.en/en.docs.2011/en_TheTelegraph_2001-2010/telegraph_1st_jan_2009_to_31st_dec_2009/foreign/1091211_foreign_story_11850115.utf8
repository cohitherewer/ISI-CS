	Chicago, Dec. 10 (Reuters): US researchers have found a drug-free way to block fearful memories, opening up the possibility of new treatment approaches for problems such as post-traumatic stress disorder, they reported yesterday.        
	The findings in people build on studies in rats that showed that reactivating a memory opens up a specific time window in which the memory can be edited before it is stored again.

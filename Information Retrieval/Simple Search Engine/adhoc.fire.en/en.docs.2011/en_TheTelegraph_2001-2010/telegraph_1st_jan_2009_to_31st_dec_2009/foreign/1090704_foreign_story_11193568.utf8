	London, July 3: David Beckhams schoolgirl niece Georgina Every has been diagnosed with swine flu.         
	The England and AC Milan footballer has sent the 11-year-old his love and wished her a speedy recovery. The youngster was infected after going on a school trip to an adventure park last week. Georgina, who attends St Edwards Church of England Primary School in Romford, Essex, was attending a five-day camp.         
	Beckhams sister, Lynne Every, 36, said Georgina was suffering severe coughing fits and aching legs and was now taking the drug tamiflu as she fights the virus.         
	Beckham, 33, has always been close to his older sister Lynne.                     THE DAILY TELEGRAPH

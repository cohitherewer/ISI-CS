                                                                                                               UK airline plotters get life in jail
                            
	London, Sept. 14 (Reuters): Three Britons were jailed for life today for plotting a terrorist outrage on the scale of the September 11 attacks by blowing up transatlantic airliners bound for North America using bombs made from liquid explosives.        
	The suspected al Qaida plot, which British detectives said was just days from being put into operation, had huge worldwide ramifications leading to tight restrictions on the amount of liquids passengers could take on board aircraft.        
	The bombers intended to destroy at least seven planes, carrying over 200 passengers each, in mid-flight between Heathrow airport and the US and Canada in August 2006 using explosives hidden in soft drink bottles. They were arrested that month.        
	The guilty trio were jailed for life. Ringleader Abdulla Ahmed Ali, 28, was told he would serve a minimum of 40 years behind bars; Assad Sarwar, 29, was jailed for at least 36 years; and Tanvir Hussain, 28, received a minimum term of 32 years, the Press Association reported. The judge said the plan, had reached an advanced stage in its development and that the men had chemicals to make 20 bombs.

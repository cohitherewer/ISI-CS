                              Padma: No stigma                            
	London, April 15 (PTI): Almost a year-and-a-half after Sir Salman Rushdie and Padma Lakshmi divorced, the India-born British novelists former wife has revealed The Naked Truth.        
	The 38-year-old Indian model is staging a comeback to modelling by stripping off in a photoshoot for Allure magazines The Naked Truth feature along with four other top models, British newspaper the Daily Mail reported.         
	But, she has refused to follow a strict diet.         
	I think I look better when I have a little bit of weight  my breasts are fuller, and Im curvier than when Im at my thinnest, Lakshmi was quoted as telling Allure in this months edition. She said she didnt feel worried about stripping off, and just exercised an extra bit in preparation.         
	I tend to sleep in the nude. When Im in my own personal space, I do spend time with very little on. I didnt feel any more naked without my robe. I dont have any stigma attached to my body, she said.         
	Lakshmis shoot has also revealed a seven-inch scar on her right arm  the vestige of a car accident when she was only 14 years old.         
	This is my favourite part of my body. I love it because it makes me a person who has an interesting past, and it reminds me that I can survive any pain.        
	While Lakshmi is stripping for her art, her ex-husband 61-year-old Sir Salman went public with his new love, American actress Pia Glenn. The couple split 18 months back.

	Jakarta, Sept. 2 (Reuters): A powerful earthquake killed at least 32 people and forced thousands to evacuate on Indonesias main island, the countrys disaster management agency said, adding that the toll could climb much higher.        
	The 7.0 magnitude quake, as recorded by the US Geological Survey, shook buildings in Jakarta and flattened homes in villages closer to the epicentre in West Java.        
	Priyadi Kardono, an official at the National Disaster Mitigation Agency, warned the death toll could be much higher, as scores of houses and office buildings had collapsed or suffered severe damage.        
	Communications with the coastal areas were completely cut, so we dont know the conditions there. No reports have come from those areas, although we assume those were the most affected ones. Its possible the death toll could grow higher, he said.        
	The health ministry said it was sending medical teams to the affected areas in West Java. State news agency Antara reported that villagers were clearing away the rubble from collapsed buildings to try to find survivors and bodies.

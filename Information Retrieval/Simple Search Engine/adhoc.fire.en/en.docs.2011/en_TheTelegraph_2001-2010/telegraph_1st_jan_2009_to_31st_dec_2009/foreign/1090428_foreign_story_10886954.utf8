	Beyonce catfight    
	 Los Angeles, April 27 (Reuters): Did someone say catfight?      
	The prospect of a saucy smackdown between R amp;B singer Beyonce Knowles and teen-movie siren Ali Larter propelled the new Fatal Attraction-style thriller Obsessed to the top of the weekend box office in North America.      
	According to studio estimates issued yesterday, Obsessed sold $28.5 million worth of tickets, earning about twice what industry pundits had forecast.      
	Knowles, the former Destinys Child frontwoman who recently played blues icon Etta James in Cadillac Records, stars as a woman who engages in a no-holds-barred fight to save her marriage when a pretty office worker (Larter) falls hard for her husband (Idris Elba). This is one of those movies where you want to watch Beyonce kick butt, said Rory Bruer, Columbias president of worldwide distribution.

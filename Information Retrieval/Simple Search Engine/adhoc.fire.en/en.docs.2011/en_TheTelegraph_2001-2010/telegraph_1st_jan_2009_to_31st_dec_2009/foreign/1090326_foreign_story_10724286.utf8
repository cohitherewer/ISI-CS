                                                                                                               Charged for in-flight birth
                            
	Wellington, March 25 (AP): A woman who gave birth aboard an international flight without anyone noticing was charged by New Zealand police today with abandoning her daughter after the newborn was found in a toilet garbage bin.        
	 The unnamed 29-year-old Samoan mother walked off a Pacific Blue flight from Samoa to Auckland last Thursday after apparently giving birth during the flight.         
	Soon afterward, cleaners found the newborn child lying amid bloodied paper towels in a toilet bin.

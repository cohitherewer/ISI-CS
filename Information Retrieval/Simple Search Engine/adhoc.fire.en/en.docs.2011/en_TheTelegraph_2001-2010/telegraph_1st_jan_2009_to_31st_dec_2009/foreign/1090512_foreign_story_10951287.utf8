	Kathmandu, May 11: Madhesi parties, who are poised to play a critical role in the formation of the next Nepal government, today announced that they would support any party which promised to implement their eight-point charter of demands.         
	Leaders of the United Madhesi Democratic Front (UMDF), which includes the Madhesi Janadhikar Forum, Terai Madhes Democratic Party and Nepal Sadbhavana Party, have decided to ask the CPN-UML for an assurance on their demands. The UMDF will support any party which pledges to implement our eight-point agreement signed with the government on February 28, 2008, Jitendra Dev, a leader of the front, said here.         
	Dev added that the front will start talks with the parties that are planning to lead the new government. We want the Maoists, Nepali Congress and CPN-UML to take immediate initiatives to end the current political impasse.

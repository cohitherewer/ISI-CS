	London, Dec. 3: Scientists at the University of Montreal launched a search for men who had never looked at pornography  but couldnt find any.        
	Researchers were conducting a study comparing the views of men in their 20s who had never been exposed to pornography with regular users.        
	But their project stumbled at the first hurdle when they failed to find a single man who had not been seen it. We started our research seeking men in their 20s who had never consumed pornography, said Prof. Simon Louis Lajeunesse. We couldnt find any.        
	The study examined the habits of those young men who used pornography  which was all of them.                    THE DAILY TELEGRAPH

	New bold Katie  
	London, Oct. 21 (PTI): Actor Tom Cruise rsquo;s wife Katie Holmes, who is known for her sober sartorial sense, went for a shocking bold look with a see-through dress.   
	The 30-year-old actress shed her motherly image with the not-so-demure transparent dress, reports the Daily Mail.  
	She wore the outfit, designed by Tunisian Azzedine Alaia, with plain court shoes and a black bag, the Mail said. The Batman Begins actress was attending the 16th annual Elle Women in Hollywood Tribute in Los Angeles.   
	No Bridget    
	 Los Angeles (PTI): Hollywood actress Renee Zellweger has shrugged off any plans of reprising her Bridget Jones character and insists that she knows nothing about the plans for another sequel. However, Zellweger, who is dating Hangover star Bradley Cooper, says that she has not been approached about the role.

	London, May 2: Art student Sara Watson has found the ultimate way of avoiding traffic wardens  by making her car invisible.         
	The 22-year-old student at the University of Central Lancashire spray painted a battered Skoda Fabia to match the car park and entrance to her art studio. Her work, created as part of her drawing and image making course at the university, creates the illusion that the car is see through.         
	She was given the car from a breakers yard and worked for three weeks to ensure that it blended perfectly with its surroundings. I was experimenting with the whole concept of illusion but needed something a bit more physical to make a real impact. said Watson, who is from Ashton under Lyne.

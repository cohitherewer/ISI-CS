The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | 8 US soldiers killed in Kandahar bombings
                                                                                                               8 US soldiers killed in Kandahar bombings

	Kabul, Oct. 27 (AP): Eight American troops were killed in two separate insurgent attacks today in southern Afghanistan, making October the deadliest month of the war for US forces since the 2001 invasion to oust the Taliban.        
	In one of the assaults, seven Americans were killed while patrolling in armoured vehicles, US forces spokesman Lt. Col. Todd Vician said. He added that an Afghan civilian died in the same attack. The eighth American was killed in a separate attack elsewhere in the south, also while patrolling in a military vehicle, he said.        
	The military issued a statement saying the deaths occurred during multiple, complex bomb strikes. It said several troops were wounded and evacuated to a nearby medical facility, but gave no other details.        
	Capt. Adam Weece, a spokesman for American forces in the south, said both attacks occurred in Kandahar province. In Washington, a US defence official said at least one was followed by an intense firefight with militants who attacked after an initial bomb went off.         
	The official spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorised to release the information.        
	The deaths bring to 55 the total number of American troops killed in October in Afghanistan. The previous high occurred in August, when 51 US soldiers died and the troubled nation held the first round of its presidential elections amid a wave of Taliban insurgent attacks.        
	The deadliest month of the Iraq conflict for US forces was November 2004, when 137 Americans were killed during the assault to clear militants from the city of Fallujah.        
	A loss like this is extremely difficult for the families as well as for those who served alongside these brave service members, said navy Capt. Jane Campbell, a military spokeswoman. Our thoughts and prayers are with the families and friends who mourn their loss.        
	The loss of life followed one of the worst days of the war for US forces in Afghanistan since they launched air strikes in 2001 to oust the Taliban from power.        
	Yesterday, a US military helicopter crashed returning from the scene of a firefight with suspected Taliban drug traffickers in western Afghanistan, killing 10 Americans including three drug enforcement agency officials. In a separate crash the same day, four more US troops were killed when two helicopters collided over southern Afghanistan.        
	US military officials insisted neither crash was the result of hostile fire.

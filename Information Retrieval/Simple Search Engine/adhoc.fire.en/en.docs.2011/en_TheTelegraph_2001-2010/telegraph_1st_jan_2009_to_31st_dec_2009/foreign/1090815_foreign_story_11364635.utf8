	Mayor Pitt? No!    
	 Los Angeles, Aug. 14 (PTI): Actor Brad Pitt has laughed off a campaign urging him to run for mayor in his adopted home of New Orleans, Louisiana, saying that politics is not what I do best.      
	The Babel star has reportedly been asked by city residents to run for public office after helping rebuild the Lower Ninth Ward area through his Make It Right Foundation. Pitt helped provide affordable housing for families displaced by Hurricane Katrina, reports People magazine.      
	However, the actor said that he would not make a good candidate. Yeah, Im running (for the office of mayor) on the gay marriage, no religion, legalisation and taxation of marijuana platform! No, I dont have a chance! Its not what I do best, Pitt said.

	Islamabad, Sept. 10 (PTI): Pakistan Taliban commander in the northwestern Swat Valley, Maulana Fazlullah, has been badly injured in operations by the army and will soon meet the fate of Baitullah Mehsud who was killed in a drone attack, interior minister Rehman Malik said.        
	 In an interview to The News daily, Malik said Fazlullah, known in Swat as Radio Mullah for his fiery sermons on FM radio, had been badly injured and he had lost one of his legs during bombing by Pakistan forces. He added that Fazlullah will meet the same fate as that of Mehsud.

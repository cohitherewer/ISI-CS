The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Female students a perk, says UK teacher
                                                                                                               Female students a perk, says UK teacher
          GRAEME PATON                          Kealey: Look but not touch                                  
	London, Sept. 23: A university vice-chancellor has apparently suggested that female students are a perk to be enjoyed by male academics.        
	Terence Kealey from Buckingham University said many lecturers knew girls who flaunted their curves in the classroom. He compared the experience to Stringfellows, the infamous London lap-dancing club, and warned academics to look but not touch.        
	The comments were made in a light-hearted article in the Times Higher Education magazine focusing on the seven deadly sins of university life. Kealeys piece  on lust  said: Most male lecturers know that, most years, there will be a girl in class who flashes her admiration and who asks for advice on her essays. What to do? Enjoy her! Shes a perk.        
	The comments were condemned last night by the National Union of Students who said they displayed an astounding lack of respect for women. But supporters of Kealey  a clinical biochemist who has led Buckingham, Britains only independent university, since 2001  insisted the remarks were intended as a joke.                            THE DAILY TELEGRAPH

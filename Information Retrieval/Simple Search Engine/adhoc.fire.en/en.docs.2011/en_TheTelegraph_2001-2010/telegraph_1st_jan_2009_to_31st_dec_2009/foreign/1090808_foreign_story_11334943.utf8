  - Former airport boss was accused of graft, bribery        MICHAEL WINES AND MARK MCDONALD                          Li Peiying                                        
	Beijing, Aug. 7: China executed the former head of a huge state-owned airport holding company today, six months after he was convicted on bribery and embezzlement charges involving more than $14.6 million.        
	The executive, Li Peiying, had been the chairman and general manager of Capital Airports Holding Company, a $14.6 billion conglomerate that runs 30 airports in nine Chinese provinces, including Beijings much-acclaimed new international airport.        
	Chinas state-run news agency, Xinhua, said that Li was executed in Jinan, a Yellow river city in eastern Chinas Shandong province. The provinces Higher Peoples Court rejected an appeal in July.        
	At his peak, Li, 60, supervised a 38,000-employee behemoth that not only served 30 per cent of the nations air passenger traffic, but had also launched forays into insurance, hotels, real estate and tourism.        
	Last February a court in Jinan ruled that he had embezzled $12.1 million from the company over a three-year period ending in 2000, and had accepted an additional $3.9 million in bribes during an eight-year period starting in 1995.        
	Most of the bribes received by Li  reportedly for loans or loan guarantees  came from Qin Hui, owner of the popular Paradise nightclub located in the luxury Great Wall Sheraton Hotel in Beijing, according to the Shanghai Daily. The court said that Lis actions had caused the nation severe financial losses.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Japan vows $1bn Pak aid, says stability important
                                                                                                               Japan vows $1bn Pak aid, says stability important
                            
	Tokyo, April 16 (AP): Japans Prime Minister announced today that Tokyo will provide up to $1 billion in aid to Pakistan to support the countrys economic reforms and fight against terrorism.        
	Prime Minister Taro Aso said the pledge will be made tomorrow, when Japan hosts a one-day international donors conference. Aso made the announcement after a meeting with Pakistan President Asif Ali Zardari.        
	Pakistans economic reform and counterterrorism measures are important for Pakistans development and Japan plans to actively provide assistance to that end, Aso said at a joint news conference. He said stability in Pakistan was also critically important for the stability of Afghanistan.        
	Pakistan is hoping to get as much as $6 billion in pledges during the conference, but Japanese officials have said they expect the figure to be closer to $4 billion and have warned against inflated expectations.        
	Japan has stressed the conference will try to steer away from getting too involved in issues that are more closely associated with Afghanistan, but acknowledged there is a growing awareness the two often overlap and can be hard to deal with separately.        
	The conference is scheduled to be divided into two main sessions, one focusing on coordinating political support for Pakistans economic reforms and the second to delve more deeply into specific pledges.        
	Japan, which is hoping its role as host will bolster its international clout, says the conference, supported by the World Bank, will be attended by about 25 backers, including the US, China and Saudi Arabia. A tally of pledges is expected to be announced at the end of the meeting.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Banks tennis splurge
                                                                                                               Banks tennis splurge
										      IAN JOHNSTON                              
	London, June 21: The Royal Bank of Scotland is to spend up to 300,000 (Rs 2.4 crore) on corporate entertaining at Wimbledon despite its bail-out by taxpayers.         
	Customers of RBS, which is now more than 70 per cent owned by the government, will enjoy fine dining and champagne courtesy of the bank as they watch the tennis championships at the All England Club, which start tomorrow.         
	It reported record UK losses in 2008 and tens of thousands of staff have lost their jobs. According to the Mail on Sunday, the RBS corporate hospitality package is costing up to 300,000.         
	An email leaked to the paper describes the banks booking of an entertainment suite for more than 42 guests for each of the tournaments 13 days, at a cost of at least 19,500 (Rs 15 lakh) a day.         
	In addition, the bank will pay up to 100 for each Centre Court seat and 75 a head for lunch.         
	Vince Cable, the Liberal Democrat Treasury spokesperson, said the spending was totally insensitive.         
	He added: The public mood will not tolerate this kind of self-serving extravagance. Its not acceptable for corporate fat cats to have a good time at the public expense.         
	John Mann, a Labour MP, said: There is no place whatsoever for this kind of largesse at the current time. These people are quaffing champagne while making their employees redundant. This is greed feeding greed.         
	A spokesperson for RBS could not confirm the costs but said the hospitality was for customers, not staff, and was a contractual obligation.         
	We fully recognise that as we get our house in order we need to be seen to change the way we operate, the spokesperson said.         
	We have cut our hospitality by 90 per cent this year to recognise the reality of our situation. The cost of the Wimbledon event is already sunk in and contracted.         
	We are using it to support our charity partners and customer relationships which are vital to our success.         
	Earlier this week, Fred Goodwin, the banks former chief executive, bowed to public pressure and offered to hand back more than 210,000 a year of his controversial pension payout.

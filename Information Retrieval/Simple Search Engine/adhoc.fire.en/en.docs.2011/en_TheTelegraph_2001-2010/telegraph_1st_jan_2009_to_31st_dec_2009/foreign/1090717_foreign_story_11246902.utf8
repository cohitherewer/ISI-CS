	New York, July 16: A toddler who drove his battery-powered toy truck into a river survived by clinging to it as he was swept almost eight miles downstream.        
	Demetrius Jones, who turned 3 yesterday, was rescued from swirling 10 feet deep water, insisting that he wanted to get back on his boat. He had told his parents that he had made his truck into a boat and rode down the river, Anita Neudorf, his grandmother, said.        
	The baby driver had been camping with his family at Peace Island Park near his home in Fort St John, British Columbia. He was staying in Neudorfs caravan while his parents slept in a tent. He slipped out early in the morning to go for a ride on his red miniature Chevrolet Silverado.         
	When the rest of the family awoke, they found no sign of him and sounded the alarm. Other campers said they had heard the boy driving his toy. He was wearing just a nappy and a T-shirt.        
	Campers and friends started a search, everyone expecting the worst. We wouldnt go near the river because I said to my son: If hes in the river, hes gone and all I could think of was: Im going to be burying my grandson, Neudorf said.        
	The Royal Canadian Mounted Police joined the hunt. But it was five men in a boat who found Demetrius, nearly three hours after he had disappeared.         
	We just kept going down the river watching all the log jams and keeping our eyes out for any sign of the car or the boy, Don Loewen, one of the rescuers, said.         
	We spotted something that looked like some rocks or an eagle.        
	 The rocks were the black tyres of the overturned toy truck sticking up out of the water. And what we thought was an eagle or something was the little boys blond head.        
	The men manoeuvred their boat towards where Demetrius was kneeling in the upside-down truck. It was half-submerged and Demetriuss legs and hands were underwater. I shut off the boat and I jumped into the water and swam over to him and the boys idled up to him with the boat and we pulled him in, Loewen said.        
	We started wrapping him in our floating coats and started rubbing him and rubbing him until he got warm.

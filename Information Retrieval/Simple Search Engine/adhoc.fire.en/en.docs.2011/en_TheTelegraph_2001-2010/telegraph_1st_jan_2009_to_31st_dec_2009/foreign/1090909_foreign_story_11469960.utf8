	Damon binge    
	 Los Angeles, Sept. 8 (PTI): Actor Matt Damon had the funnest time ever working on his coming film The Informant because he could binge on fatty foods and skip sessions at the gym.       
	The star packed on some 14kg to portray the character of bipolar whistleblower Mark Whitacre in the dark comedy, reports People magazine. He ploughed his way through hamburgers at McDonalds to prepare for the role and added to his unflattering look with a handlebar moustache, a wig and thick glasses.     
	Demi age    
	London (PTI): Actress Demi Moores recent admission that she has never went under the knife seems unbelievable as the 46-year-old actress looks half her age in advertisments for her new perfume Wanted. Moore, who is married to Ashton Kutcher, 31, and has three grown-up daughters with former husband Bruce Willis, is seen frolicking with the model wearing a black negligee. She had earlier said that she hopes to have a fourth child with Kutcher.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | BlackBerry network fails
                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      BlackBerry network fails
          CLAUDINE BEAUMONT                          Unhappy delay                                  
	Dec. 23: BlackBerry users in the US have been left unable to send and receive emails after the second network outage in a week        
	The failure is also affecting BlackBerry users in South America. Research in Motion, the Canadian company that makes the BlackBerry range of mobile email devices, said that some customers were experiencing delays in message delivery.        
	Technical teams are actively working to resolve the issue for those impacted. We apologise for any inconvenience, said the company in a statement.        
	 The email problems appear to be affecting BlackBerry users on a number of networks, including AT amp;T, Verizon, Sprint and T-Mobile in the US. Its the second outage to hit BlackBerry devices in a week  scores of users reported problems sending and receiving mail on December 17.        
	However, it seemed to affect individual and small business users, rather than large corporations.        
	Network outages are becoming an increasingly common problem for mobile phone operators as they struggle to cope with the growing volume of data traffic across their networks.         
	Earlier this week, the O2 network crashed in the UK, with some people unable to make calls, browse the Internet, or send and receive email for up to 36 hours. Vodafone has also suffered network glitches in recent months.        
	Problems with the BlackBerry networks are particularly keenly felt, because millions of people around the world rely on the devices for mobile operations and workflow management. Research in Motion suffered outages in April 2007 and again in February 2008, when a software update bought the service to its knees.

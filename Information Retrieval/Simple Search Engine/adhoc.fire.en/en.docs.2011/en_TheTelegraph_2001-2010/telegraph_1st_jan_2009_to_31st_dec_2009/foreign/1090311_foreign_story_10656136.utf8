The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Effort on to avert Pak showdown
                                                                                                               Effort on to avert Pak showdown
          NASIR JAFFRY                               
	Islamabad, March 10: Pakistan once again stands at a dangerous flashpoint of its nascent parliamentary democratic history with chances of an imminent showdown between ruling Pakistan Peoples Party and oppositions Pakistan Muslim League (N) over the issue of deposed judges.         
	The two parties, which had struggled together to oust military ruler Pervez Musharraf from presidency are now heading towards what many call a deadly collision days ahead of the scheduled long march of lawyers fraternity aimed to press for restoration of judges deposed by Musharraf.         
	Former prime minister Nawaz Sharif, who heads the PML(N) had last month announced to join the long march which is to start from Karachi on March 12 and culminate into a sit-in by thousands of lawyers in front of the parliament house on March 16.         
	We will stage the sit-in until all the judges including chief justice Iftikhar Mohammad Chaudhry, who were sacked by Musharraf after declaring illegal and unconstitutional emergency rule in November 2007, are restored, leader of the lawyers movement Ali Ahmad Kurd told The Telegraph .         
	But Sharifs decision to join the march along with other religious and political parties including Jamat-e-Islami irked the government, which vowed not to allow the marchers to enter into capital and disrupt the public order.         
	I raise the flag of rebellion  the decisions will now be taken on the roads and we will bring a revolution in the country, said Sharif in an unusually hard hitting address in Lahore, sending shockwaves through the government, which is already under intense international pressure to expose culprits of the Mumbai attacks and to curb growing militancy and terrorism.         
	Interior ministry chief Rehman Malik was quick enough to warn Sharif of consequences of a rebellion, saying the statement fall in the category of sedition and if any death occurred or public property is damaged during the long march, the government would invoke sedition law against him.         
	But analysts believe Maliks statement was nothing but a mere intimidation at this stage.         
	It is an intimidation out of frustration in the wake of insistence by Sharif brothers for removal of governors rule in Punjab and their resolve to participate in the long march, leading political analyst Imtiaz Gul told this scribe.         
	Gul, who also heads his independent think tank, Centre for Research and Security studies, said both the government and the PML(N)-led opposition are heading for a show down.         
	They have embarked on a confrontationist path which is especially alarming for the might military establishment, which used such occasions in the past to intervene, he said in reference to Nawaz and Shahbaz, who were disqualified last month by the Supreme Court from contesting parliamentary elections and holding any public office.         
	This might turn out to be a clash of titans, he remarked.         
	Guls remarks came amid reports in the Indian media that army chief Ashfaq Kayani sent a message to president Zardari after his recent visit to the US, asking him to set the things right before March 16.         
	But military officials described the reports as rubbish saying that the army remains apolitical and it is job of the political leadership to straighten the affairs.         
	Whatever may be the feeling among the top military echelon, the government seems determined not to allow the lawyers to enter Islamabad.         
	The protestors are most welcome if they stay in a designated area on the outskirts of Islamabad because the government does not want normal life to suffer, a senior government official said against the backdrop of ongoing efforts by coalition partners of the PPP for a patch-up between Zardari and Sharifs.         
	We have held several rounds of talks with Nawaz Sharif and Asif Zardari in an effort to resolve differences between them, chief of pro-Taliban Jamiatul Ulema-e-Islam (JUI) Maulana Fazlur Rehman said while talking to reporters on Tuesday.         
	Rehman and chief of the pashtun nationalist Awami National Party (ANP) Asfandyar Wali, have been mediating between Sharif and Zardari.         
	Sources privy to these meetings said that Sharif wants restoration of judges and the deposed government of his younger brother Shahbaz in Punjab.         
	President Zardari is ready to sort out these issues but want an assurance that Sharif will play a role in calling off the long march, Rehman said, adding that Sharif was hesitant to give an assurance.         
	Sharif, who had joined the coalition government after trouncing Musharrafs Pakistan Muslim League(Q) in February 2008 parliament election, parted ways with PPP after it refused to restored deposed judges and nominated Zardari for office of the president without consulting the PML(N)

	Tehran, June 28 (Agencies): Iran has detained several local British embassy staff, sparking a new row with Britain today that underscored the hard-line leaderships effort to blame post-election unrest on foreign powers, not popular anger.        
	British foreign secretary David Miliband demanded the release of all the staff still held and said his European Union colleagues had agreed to a strong, collective response to any such harassment and intimidation against EU missions.        
	Supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei denounced what he called interfering statements by western officials following the disputed presidential election.        
	If the (Iranian) nation and officials are unanimous and united, then the temptations of international ill-wishers and interfering and cruel politicians will no longer have an impact, state radio quoted him as saying.        
	Witnesses in Iran said police clashed with up to 3,000 protesters near a mosque in north Tehran today.        
	They said security forces fired tear gas to disperse the crowd, and some demonstrators fought back, chanting: Where is my vote?        
	Witnesses at the scene said some protesters claimed they suffered broken arms or legs in todays clashes around the Ghoba Mosque.        
	They said some young demonstrators screamed at the police and then attacked them after the officers allegedly beat an elderly woman.        
	The authorities have repeatedly accused Britain and the US of inciting the turmoil Iran has experienced since the June 12 election, the most striking display of internal dissent since the Islamic Revolution in 1979. Both countries deny it.        
	Eight local employees at the British embassy who had a considerable role in the recent unrest were taken into custody, the semi-official Fars news agency said, without saying when.        
	Irans intelligence minister Gholamhossein Mohseni-Ejei confirmed several British embassy staff had been detained and some had been released, state radio reported, giving no details. He said the embassy had played a role in the unrest.        
	Miliband said about nine employees had been detained, but some had been freed. The idea that the British embassy is somehow behind the demonstrations and protests that have been taking place in Tehran in recent weeks is wholly without foundation, he told reporters at a conference in Corfu, an island northwest of Athens.        
	Britain and Iran have already expelled two of each others diplomats since the election.

                                                                                                               Sixty Taliban killed in raid
                            
	Peshawar, Oct. 18 (Reuters): Pakistani forces exchanged heavy fire today with the Taliban defending their heartland, a day after launching an offensive aimed at bringing the writ of the state to lawless lands on the Afghan border.        
	The army said 60 militants and five soldiers had been killed in the first 24 hours of the offensive in South Waziristan. Soldiers were securing territory while some militants were fleeing, it said.        
	About 28,000 soldiers are battling an estimated 10,000 Taliban militants, including about 1,000 Uzbek fighters and some Arab al Qaida members.        
	The army said it had surrounded the militants in their main zone, a wedge of territory in the north of South Waziristan, and soldiers backed by aircraft and artillery were attacking from the north, southwest and southeast.        
	Government forces pushing down from the north were clashing with militants in Nawaz Kot town, intelligence officials and residents said.        
	There was heavy firing until midnight and in the morning I saw tanks moving in and the Taliban were firing rocket-propelled grenades, said villager Gul Nawaz, who lives near Nawaz Kot.        
	Security officials said soldiers advancing from the southwest met dogged resistance as they tried to push into the Taliban-held town of Khaisora early today.        
	Soldiers moving from the southeast captured a Taliban stronghold at Spinkai Raghzai yesterday after the militants took refuge in nearby mountains, officials said. But Taliban spokesman said the army was being repulsed. He vowed attacks on President Barack Obamas supporters.

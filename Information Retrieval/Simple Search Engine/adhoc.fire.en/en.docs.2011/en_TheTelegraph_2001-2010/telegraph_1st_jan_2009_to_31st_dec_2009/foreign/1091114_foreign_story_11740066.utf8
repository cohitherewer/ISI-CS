	Horrific Halle    
	 London, Nov. 13 (PTI): Actress Halle Berry has said that she was once attracted to abusive men because of her horrific past.       
	The 42-year-old regularly witnessed her father attack her mother when she was growing up and said it affected her choice in partners.      
	My mother was a battered woman and that was my childhood for a good chunk of it. Early on in my life, I made choices, and I chose men that were abusive because that was what I knew growing up, Berry said.     
	Potter pot    
	London (PTI): Harry Potter star Daniel Radcliffe has been caught on camera smoking cannabis at a private party. The actor was so high on the weed that he let a girl scrawl all over his face with a pen. He was laughing and shouting after smoking the joint.

	London, Jan. 21: If ever two little girls deserved a puppy, its Malia and Sasha Obama.         
	In fact, Id say that sitting in the freezing cold while some crazy preacher hams up the Lords Prayer and an old lady in a sparkly hat sings a deranged version of the national anthem is not just worth a puppy  its worth at the very least a pony. Who knows, if Obama turns out to be the magician everyone is hoping for, he may even be able to conjure up a unicorn.         
	It would seem logical to assume that for Malia and Sasha all this  the fanfare, the tributes, the millions of wellwishers chanting their fathers name in unison  might be a bit too much.         
	In reality, however, it probably isnt. For now, this is all they know. It may seem weird to us; but to them it is simply reality. Children have a wonderful knack of living purely in the moment. They dont worry about the past, or reflect on the future.         
	Malia and Sasha, like all young children of people in the public eye, just see things from the perspective of their own universe. To them, the White House is not a great symbol of the glory of the office of the President of the United States of America; its just their new home. A bodyguard is not a constant reminder of the threat that their father now faces daily; hes just a big guy in a suit who hangs out with dad.         
	This is why they are able to walk down the steps to their fathers inauguration with such extraordinary composure  far more composure, in fact, than the man himself, who more than once looked like he was on the verge of tears.         
	Sure, they have to be on their best behaviour; sure, they have to be kissed by lots of stern ladies with very stiff hair (oh, my, didnt Hillary look furious), but essentially its a family day out. Even granny was there.                     
	That the Obamas managed to pull this one off with such lan is also, of course, thanks in large part to Michelle.         
	How her heart must have jumped when he fluffed his lines. Did her brain spring immediately into overdrive, rehearsing the tactics for later when, alone at last, he will say: How do you think it went? and, for the first time that day, expect an honest answer? Or did I detect a slight curl in the lip, a slight twitch that said: I am so going to tease you for the rest of your life about this one, even if you are the first African-American man to have Hail to the Chief played in his honour?         
	In the end, it was both a triumph and a relief. Obama took the oath to thunderous applause, and secured that all-important thumbs-up  from his youngest daughter. That line from I Corinthians in his speech  the one about putting away childish things? Very elegant, very clever. I just hope it doesnt apply too soon to Malia and Sasha.                    THE TIMES, LONDON

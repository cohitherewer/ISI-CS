The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Court asked to review Sharif ruling
                                                                                                               Court asked to review Sharif ruling
          NASIR JAFFRY                               
	Islamabad, March 19: The Pakistan government asked the Supreme Court today to review a ruling last month that banned Opposition leaders from elected office and sparked a crisis.        
	We have filed four petitions asking the Supreme Court to review its earlier decision to disqualify Nawaz Sharif and Shahbaz Sharif, attorney general Latif Khosa said in Islamabad. He added that petitions have been filed on Prime Minister Yousaf Raza Gilanis directions.         
	The government has asked the court to take up the petitions at the earliest possible date. However, it is the prerogative of the chief justice to schedule a hearing, he said.        
	Last month, the court disqualified the Sharifs from elected office over convictions dating back to the rule of former President Musharraf.

                              Lawyers and riot policemen celebrate the restoration of Iftikhar Chaudhry in Lahore on Monday. Many law-enforcement officials had pulled back from the streets of Lahore as protesters led by Nawaz Sharif marched towards Islamabad on Sunday. (AFP)                            
	Islamabad, March 16 (Reuters): Iftikhar Chaudhry, the symbol of resistance in Pakistan, is the son of a policeman and was appointed the youngest-ever chief justice in June 2005.        
	The 60-year-old judge captured the imagination of the country used to years of dictatorship after he refused to quit in the face of pressure from the then President Pervez Musharraf and his intelligence chiefs.        
	Musharraf suspended Chaudhry on March 9, 2007, after the judge refused to go quietly when accused of abusing his position and various other misdemeanours.        
	A panel of judges was established to look into the accusations against Chaudhry, who appointed Aitzaz Ahsan, a parliamentarian and former minister from Benazir Bhuttos Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP), to lead his defence team.        
	Several reasons have been attributed to Musharrafs decision to remove Chaudhry.        
	At the time Chaudhry was suspended, he was hearing a case he had taken up on his own volition into the disappearance of people picked up by security agencies on suspicion of being involved in terrorism.         
	The agencies were nonplussed when Chaudhry told them to produce missing people in court.        
	Chaudhry had also irked Prime Minister Shaukat Aziz by taking up a case looking into the privatisation of a steel firm and cancelling the sale. He also reportedly upset influential people by taking up a case involving a land development scheme. But the reason most people thought Musharraf moved against the judge was that the general anticipated Chaudhry would try to make him stand by a constitutional requirement to give up his role as army chief if he was to seek another term as President.        
	In July 2007, supreme court judges delivered the first ever finding against a military ruler by lifting Musharrafs suspension of Chaudhry.        
	When Musharraf engineered his re-election by a subservient parliament in October without first stepping down as army chief, the supreme court allowed the vote to go ahead while it deliberated whether the Constitution had been violated and the result should stand.        
	Musharrafs patience snapped a month later when he declared emergency rule and dismissed judges who refused to take fresh oath of office. Chaudhry refused, saying Musharrafs acts were unconstitutional. Having secured the presidency, Musharraf then stepped down as army chief.        
	In a general election in February last year, the PPP swept to power riding a sympathy wave after Benazir Bhuttos assassination a few weeks earlier. Zardari took over the leadership of the PPP and enticed Sharifs PML-N to join a coalition by promising to restore Chaudhry and the other judges sacked by Musharraf, who was still the President.         
	It soon became apparent to Sharif that Zardari would go back on his word and he pulled out of the coalition.        
	Zardari reinstated most of the judges Musharraf had dismissed but he feared that if Chaudhry was restored he would rule Musharraf an illegal President and overturn an amnesty he had given Zardari and Benazir Bhutto in late 2007 to allow them to return to Pakistan without fear of prosecution in old corruption cases.        
	In August, Zardari forced Musharraf to quit gracefully rather than face impeachment.         
	Musharraf still needs some form of indemnity from parliament to be sure he isnt tried for violating the constitution. But Sharif, overthrown as Prime Minister by Musharraf in 1999, wanted Musharraf to stand trial.        
	Last month, Sharif put his weight behind plans by lawyers for a long march across the country to press for Chaudhrys reinstatement.        
	Zardari responded by ejecting Sharifs party from power in the Punjab province after the Supreme Court barred Sharif and his brother Shahbaz from holding elected office.        
	That action incited the Sharifs to go with a full force behind the lawyers march, raising fears that a violent confrontation would occur and the army would be forced to intervene just a year after a civilian government was formed.        
	Confronted with the dangers, with Sharif bearing down on Islamabad at the head of the march, Zardari decided to relent and give Chaudhry back his job.

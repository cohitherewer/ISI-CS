	Kathmandu, May 17: Hopes of an end to Nepals political uncertainty rose today with 22 parties backing Communist Party of Nepal (UML) veteran Madhav Kumar Nepal to form a government.        
	Letters of support were handed over to Nepal by 350 lawmakers from these parties, clearing the decks for a UML-led coalition after a fortnight-long stalemate. The majority mark is 301.        
	The crisis was triggered by the resignation of Maoist Prime Minister Prachanda after his move to sack the army chief was spiked by President Ram Baran Yadav.        
	The letters of support were sent to Constituent Assembly Speaker Subhash Nemwang, who began verifying them this afternoon before the process of forming the government was initiated.        
	President Yadav had directed Nemwang to explore the possibility of forming a government after all parties failed to cobble up enough support in the 601-member House. Only two of 24 parties in Parliament  the Maoists and the Nepal Workers and Peasants Party  havent supported the UML.        
	The breakthrough in the efforts to form a government came when the fourth largest party, Madhesi Peoples Rights Forum, agreed to support the UML after blocking attempts at government formation for several days.        
	Forum chief Upendra Yadav, a known Maoist supporter and foreign minister in the Prachanda government, relented only when party colleague Bijay Gachchadar threatened to walk out with 35 lawmakers.

                                                                                                               Lovers killed 
                            
	Kabul, April 14 (AP): Taliban gunmen executed a young couple in southern Afghanistan for trying to elope, shooting them with rifles in front of a crowd in a lawless, militant-controlled region, officials said today.        
	The woman, 19, and the man, 21, were accused by the militants of immoral acts, and a council of conservative clerics decided that the two should be killed, said Ghulam Dastagir Azad, the governor of the southwestern province of Nimroz.        
	Riflemen in the remote district of Khash Rod shot the man and woman with AK-47s yesterday during a public execution, said Sadiq Chakhansori, the chief of Nimrozs provincial council. In remote and dangerous regions of Afghanistan, Taliban fighters operate what are sometimes referred to as shadow governments, where militant leaders serve as government officials and run their own police units and pseudo court systems.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Singh-Obama meeting points
                                                                                                               Singh-Obama meeting points
          AMIT ROY                              
	London, April 1: Manmohan Singh and President Barack Obama, both in London for the G20 summit, have expressed many common views, especially in the need to inject a fiscal stimulus into their respective economies, in interviews the two leaders have given to the Financial Times.        
	The Indian Prime Ministers interview, in which he compares Indias achievement favourably with that of China and also expresses impatience with the Pakistan governments inability or refusal to control its home-grown terrorists, appears a day after Obama spoke to the paper.        
	While the former was interviewed in Delhi just before leaving for London, Obama spoke to the paper at the White House in Washington before setting out for the summit.        
	The fact that out of all the G20 leaders only Obama and Singh have been interviewed so far by the premier financial newspaper in the UK could be used by Congress supporters back in India to bolster the Indian Prime Ministers personal standing in the run up to the general election.        
	That might well have been a calculation on both sides but certainly Indian officials in London are pleased that on the eve of the summit, the interview has given Singh a higher profile and increased stature.        
	He rejected the notion that he was somehow emasculated by Sonia Gandhi.         
	I am not constrained by the fact that the Congress partys management is looked after by Mrs Gandhi and I can concentrate on managing the world of the government, he replied. It is a distinct advantage the fact that the Congress president has carried this heavy burden of managing the party and bringing various political parties together in the United Progressive Alliance is a positive element. Its not a constraint on me.        
	He also pointed out that India was not doing so badly when compared to China, considered the biggest player at the G20 after the US.        
	The Chinese have certain advantages, he acknowledged. The fact that its a single party government. But I do believe in the long run the fact that India is a functioning democracy committed to the rule of law. Our system is slow to move but Im confident that once decisions are taken, they are going to be far more durable.        
	He went on: You take the case of economic reform. When we launched the reform in 1991, the Financial Times and all other friends used to tell me, How will you be sure that these reforms will be carried forward by all successive governments? I used to say, Dont judge politicians by what they say but what they do in power.         
	Weve seen since 1991 there have been four or five governments in our country and none have dared to reverse the path of reform that we started. Im confident. Democracy has its problems, its slow moving, the decision-making process is slow. But once decisions are taken they are far more durable.         
	I have every reason to believe that what is happening in India to move towards an inclusive growth path, in the framework of a democratic polity, committed to the rule of law, respect for fundamental human rights. If we do succeed we have lessons for a large number of countries in the so-called Third World.        
	Asked why he thought the Lashkar- e-Toiba had been able to bounce back so quickly after the Mumbai outrage, his view was that the government and the authorities in Pakistan were either not able to control them or they are not willing to control them.        
	That the attacks on Mumbai were planned and acted upon in Pakistani territory is now admitted by everybody, including the intelligence agencies of developed countries, he said. That is living proof that despite many promises made by Pakistan since 2004 to my predecessor and to me that Pakistan will not be allowed to be used to undertake acts of terror against India, in practice no effective action has been taken to control terror.        
	Singh implicated the ISI: In the past, it has been our experience that there are elements in the armed forces of Pakistan, some segments of the ISI involved in perpetrating acts of terror, particularly the attack on the Indian embassy in Kabul. We have been told that the ISI in Pakistan has a different mindset. I hope that is right.         
	The world has a responsibility that Pakistan lives up to the promise that it will not allow its territory to be used to promote acts of terror directed against India.        
	He was cautious when invited to endorse the new Obama plan on Afghanistan which will involve putting even more money into Pakistan: I have not studied the Obama plan. We are victims of terrorism and we hope that whatever the world community plans to do they will pay adequate attention that terrorism ceases to be a problem in Afghanistan as well as Pakistan. We all know the epicentre of terrorism in the world today is Pakistan. The world community has to come to grips with this harsh reality.        
	On economic matters, there does appear to be similarities in the interviews given by the two leaders.        
	The academic, with degrees from Cambridge and Oxford, relished answering the question, What is the future of capitalism, especially in India?        
	The reply was: Capitalism with a human face. We are a mixed economy. We will remain a mixed economy. The public and private sector will continue to play a very important role. The private sector in our country has very ample scope and I am confident that Indias entrepreneurs have the capacity, and the will to rise to the occasion.         
	Obamas interview highlighted his priorities as a robust approach to stimulus, (and) fighting off protectionism.        
	Next, we have to make sure that we are all taking serious steps to deal with the problems in the banking sector and the financial markets and that means having a series of steps to deal with toxic assets and to ensure adequate capital in the banking sector, the President said.        
	Obama admitted: There are some G20 participants that are arguing fiercely for stimulus, others for regulation. We need stimulus and we need regulation.        
	Obama has tried to reassure the world that he wont be protectionist.         
	The Buy American provision that was in the (US) stimulus package was specifically written (so) that (it) had to be consistent with WTO. I have sent a very clear signal that now is not that time to offer hints of protectionism and I will continue to discourage efforts to close off the US market.        
	The Indian Prime Minister, asked about Indias policy on fiscal stimulus, responded: Ive seen a letter from the managing director of the IMF saying that the stimulus that has been planned in the year 2009 by major economies amounts to 2 per cent of GDP. This is probably adequate but its necessary to ensure that stimulus is sustained and maintained in the year 2010.        
	What Singh had to say about protectionism was not all that different from the (post-US election) stand taken by the American President. The former said: Protectionism has to be avoided. Protectionism is not only on goods but also in the area of services. Financial protectionism is also bad and should be avoided. Some action by the developed countries particularly the withdrawal of capital resources from the developing countries by the banks of the developed countries is equally worrisome. We have entirely agreed that protectionism of all sorts, including financial protectionism, has to be avoided. Although some countries have taken action, in practice the impact of what has been done has not been reversed.        
	This was Singhs wish for the summit: An agreement for effective, credible fiscal stimulus is the responsibility of all major economies to do their bit. The second is that credit flows must be resumed. For that matter, the cleaning up of the balance sheet of the financial institutions  whatever it involved. These are very unpleasant decisions.        
	He emphasised: We in the developing countries see the effect of the stoppage of credit flows much more. Capital flows have sharply declined. Trade credit has sharply declined. And there is a fall of export demand.         
	The problems of emerging economies should also be taken on board. The decline in capital flows that has taken place should be made good by providing adequate resources to the international financial institutions to come to the rescue of the emerging countries and low-income countries.        
	And this was Obama on a similar theme: A final area of concerted action involves international financial institutions and their capacity to assist emerging markets in developing countries at a time when those markets could be under even more severe strain than some of the more wealthy nations and I think making sure that institutions like the IMF have the resources to provide such assistance that world food supplies are not imperilled as a consequence of the breakdown in global trade, those are all issues that I think have to be addressed.        
	The two ought to strike a rapport when they meet tomorrow.

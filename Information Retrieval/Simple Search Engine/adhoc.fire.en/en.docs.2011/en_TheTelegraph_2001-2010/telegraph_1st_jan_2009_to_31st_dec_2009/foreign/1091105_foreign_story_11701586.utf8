	London, Nov. 4: Boris Johnson, the mayor of London, has chased off a group of girls attacking a woman, shouting at them that they were oiks.        
	Franny Armstrong, a film-maker and climate activist, was surrounded by the girls while walking home in north London. It was very frightening, she said.        
	The girls, one armed with an iron bar, pushed her against a car. At that moment a man cycled past and I called for help, Armstrong said. The cyclist, who turned out to be the mayor, stopped. He said to the girls: What do you think you are doing?, Armstrong said. She added that he chased them down the street.        
	He returned and insisted on walking her home. He was my knight on a shining bicycle, she said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Brother of Osama dead
                                                                                                               Brother of Osama dead
                            
	Riyadh, Sept. 13 (AP): The family of Osama bin Laden has announced the death of one of the terrorists brothers.        
	In a notice today in Al-Riyadh daily, the family said Thabet bin Laden had passed away. The notice said he died yesterday but did not give the cause of death or his age.        
	Thabet was one of 54 children born to Mohammed bin Laden, a poor Yemeni immigrant who started the family contracting business in the 1930s that grew into a multimillion dollar construction empire.        
	The bin Laden family disavowed any links with Osama bin Laden in 1994, when Saudi Arabia stripped him of his citizenship after he called for the overthrow of the royal family.

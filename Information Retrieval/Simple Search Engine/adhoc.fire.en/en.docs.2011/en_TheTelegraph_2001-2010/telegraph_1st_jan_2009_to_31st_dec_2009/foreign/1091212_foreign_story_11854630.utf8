The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Top Qaida leader killed in Pak

	Dec. 11: A senior al Qaida leader has been killed in a Predator drone missile strike in northwest Pakistan, US officials said.        
	They told NBC News that the attack using Hellfire missiles had taken place in the last few days. The officials said the target was not the networks Saudi leader Osama bin Laden or his Egyptian deputy Ayman al-Zawahiri.        
	CBS news quoting an official today said it was a major hit whose name will be recognisable to many when it becomes public. The report also said that the commanders unnamed deputy was also killed in the strike. Normally we wait for the National Security Agency (NSA) to study the area for 24 to 36 hours after a strike like this, the CBS quoted the official as saying.        
	The officials said they have to study the strike zone, and the behaviour of the al Qaida operatives left behind to see either if they hold a funeral for the suspected target or somehow move to replace him to be able to confirm the identity.         
	The officials told the US network that the killing followed an acceleration of operations targeting al Qaida leaders over the past weeks.        
	Northwest Pakistan has seen a surge in US strikes, which fan anti-Americanism in the nuclear-armed Muslim country, since President Barack Obama took office. They have contributed to putting the country on the front line of the war on al Qaida.        
	The government in Islamabad is under increasing western pressure to not only target Taliban groups attacking Pakistan, but also al Qaida-linked fighters and the militants who cross over the border and target foreign troops in Afghanistan. Since August 2008, at least 65 such strikes has killed around 625 people.

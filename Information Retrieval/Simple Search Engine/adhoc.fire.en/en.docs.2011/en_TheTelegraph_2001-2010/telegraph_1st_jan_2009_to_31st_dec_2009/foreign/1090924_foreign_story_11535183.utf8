	Cruz date    
	 London, Sept. 23 (PTI): Actress Penelope Cruz has revealed that shooting a movie for her is similar to going out on a date.       
	The Broken Embraces actress gets very nervous before starting a new film and gets the same feelings she has when a man takes her out.       
	In terms of the work, it always seems like its a first date. I mean, every time I go to the movie set and start a project, I feel the same feeling, the butterflies in the stomach, not having control over it, because acting is like that. Thats the beauty of it.

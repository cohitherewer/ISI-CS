The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | The spring of civilisation is drying up
                                                                                                               The spring of civilisation is drying up

	Jubaish (Iraq), July 14: Throughout the marshes, the reed gatherers, standing on land they once floated over, cry out to visitors in a passing boat.        
	Maaku mai! they shout, holding up their rusty sickles. There is no water!         
	The Euphrates is drying up. Strangled by the water policies of Iraqs neighbours, Turkey and Syria; a two-year drought; and years of misuse by Iraq and its farmers, the river is significantly smaller than it was just a few years ago. Some officials worry that it could soon be half of what it is now.         
	The shrinking of the Euphrates, a river so crucial to the birth of civilisation that the Book of Revelation prophesied its drying up as a sign of the end times, has decimated farms along its banks, has left fishermen impoverished and has depleted riverside towns as farmers flee to the cities looking for work.        
	The poor suffer more acutely, but all strata of society are feeling the effects: sheiks, diplomats and even MPs who retreat to their farms after weeks in Baghdad.        
	Along the river, rice and wheat fields have turned to baked dirt. Canals have dwindled to shallow streams, and fishing boats sit on dry land. Pumps meant to feed water treatment plants dangle pointlessly over brown puddles.         
	The old men say its the worst they remember, said Sayid Diyia, 34, a fisherman in Hindiya, sitting in a riverside cafe full of his idle colleagues. Im depending on Gods blessings.                  
	The drought is widespread in Iraq. The area sown with wheat and barley in the rain-fed north is down roughly 95 per cent from the usual, and the date palm and citrus orchards of the east are parched. For two years rainfall has been far below normal, leaving the reservoirs dry, and American officials predict that wheat and barley output will be a little over half of what it was two years ago.        
	It is a crisis that threatens the roots of Iraqs identity, not only as the land between two rivers but as a nation that was once the largest exporter of dates in the world.         
	Now Iraq is importing more and more grain. Farmers along the Euphrates say, with anger and despair, that they may have to abandon Anbar rice for cheaper varieties. Droughts are not rare in Iraq, though officials say they have been more frequent in recent years. But drought is only part of what is choking the Euphrates and its larger, healthier twin, the Tigris.        
	The most frequently cited culprits are the Turkish and Syrian governments. Iraq has plenty of water, but it is a downstream country. There are at least seven dams on the Euphrates in Turkey and Syria, according to Iraqi water officials, and with no treaties or agreements, the Iraqi government is reduced to begging its neighbours for water.        
	With the Euphrates showing few signs of increasing health, bitterness over Iraqs water threatens to be a source of tension for months or even years to come between Iraq and its neighbours.

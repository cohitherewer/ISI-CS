	London, Nov. 27: A Scottish brewery with a history of controversy claims to have made the worlds strongest beer.        
	The drink, named Tactical Nuclear Penguin is so strong that it should be served in small measures usually reserved for spirits.        
	Its maker, BrewDog brewers of Fraserburgh described the 32 per cent proof tipple as its most audacious and ambitious project to date. But its launch comes amid a high profile debate in Scotland about an epidemic of alcoholism in the country. The devolved SNP administration is considering introducing minimum pricing in an attempt to curb problem drinking.         
	BrewDog, which describes itself as making progressive, craft beers was previously responsible for an 18.2 per cent drink called Tokyo which it claimed had been banned by the Portman Group, the industry body which runs a voluntary code of conduct. It also made a low alcohol brew which it mockingly name Nanny State.

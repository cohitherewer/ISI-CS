	New York, Dec. 16: White House officials have had to explain how a second couple managed to get inside President Barack Obamas residence for an official event without an invitation.        
	Harvey and Paul Darden, Democrat supporters from Georgia, were ushered into an invitation-only veterans breakfast with Barack and Michelle Obama  and even had their photograph taken with him  after mistakenly turning up a day early for a tour of the building.        
	Unlike Tareq and Michaele Salahi, a Virginia couple who gatecrashed a White House dinner, the Dardens breach of protocol on Veterans Day was not intentional on their part. The pair said they grew increasingly mystified as they were ushered into the building.        
	The White House claimed that the Dardens had been allowed into the breakfast after going through security screening as a nice gesture after they arrived on the wrong day for their tour. However, the couple said there was no evidence that the Secret Service had realised they were not on the guest list. Darden, 67, a retired pharmacist, said he and his wife were never told about the breakfast.        
	They believed they were simply starting their tour until they were ushered into the East Room and told they would be meeting the President. The further we got into the White House, the more surprised we were, he said. My wife looked at me, and I said: You know, I dont know if were in the right place. When they approached a White House aide to suggest they had veered off course they were told to just go with the flow.

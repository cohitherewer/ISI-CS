The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Rafsanjani: Iran is in crisis

	Tehran, July 17 (Reuters): In apparent defiance of Irans supreme leader, a powerful cleric declared his country in crisis after a disputed poll, and tens of thousands of protesters used Friday prayers to stage the biggest show of dissent for weeks.        
	Clashes erupted later in central Tehran between police and followers of Opposition leader Mir Hossein Mousavi, who still contests the election result that showed hardline President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad had been re-elected by a wide margin.        
	Police fired tear gas and beat supporters of Mousavi in Keshavarz Boulevard, a witness said, adding that protesters were carrying hundreds of green banners  Mousavis campaign colour  and chanted Ahmadinejad, resign, resign.        
	Former President Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani, a moderate who backed Mousavis election campaign, said many Iranians had doubts about the official result of the June 12 vote.        
	I hope with this sermon we can pass through this period of hardships that can be called a crisis, said the influential cleric, leading prayers for the first time since the poll.        
	Live state radio broadcasts of Friday prayers at Tehran University, with a dual religious and political sermon delivered by a top cleric, have been a staple of revolutionary Iran. No senior establishment figure has previously described the post-election turmoil as a crisis for the Islamic Republic.         
	Rafsanjanis remarks posed a clear challenge to Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, who has upheld the election result and accused foreign powers of fomenting the unrest.        
	In the streets outside Tehran University, police used tear gas and batons to disperse Mousavi supporters who had flocked to the prayers. At least 15 people were arrested, a witness said. Mousavi, Prime Minister in the 1980s, attended the ceremony in his first official public appearance since the presidential vote, which he says was rigged. The authorities deny any fraud.        
	Rafsanjani, who heads the Council of Experts  a powerful body that can in theory dismiss the supreme leader  attacked the way authorities had handled the poll and its aftermath. When people are not in the scene and their votes are not there, that government is not Islamic, he said, referring to Opposition charges of vote-rigging. Today is a bitter day.        
	Rafsanjani criticised the Guardian Council, a clerical body which vets candidates and considers election complaints, for failing to do its job even though it was given five extra days to make its assessment.

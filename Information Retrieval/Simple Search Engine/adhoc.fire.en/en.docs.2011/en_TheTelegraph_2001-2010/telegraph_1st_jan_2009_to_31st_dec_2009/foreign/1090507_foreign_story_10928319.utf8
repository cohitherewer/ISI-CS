	Colombo, May 6: At least four people have died inside the internment camps where the Sri Lankan government is holding and screening almost 190,000 ethnic Tamil civilians who have fled the fighting with the Tamil Tigers, The Times has learnt.         
	Three women were found dead at a bathing area in one camp on Monday, and a child was crushed to death in a stampede for food in another last week, according to UN officials and documents. They were the first reported deaths inside the controversial camps, which the government says are necessary to root out the rebels, but some Tamil activists and MPs have likened to concentration camps.         
	The UN officials said that the three dead women were found in a camp called Manik Farms Zone 2, where Des Browne, the former defence secretary and four other British MPs were taken yesterday to view the humanitarian relief effort. A spokesman for the British High Commission said that the MPs were not informed about the deaths and did not raise them in meetings with President Rajapaksa and other senior officials. Gordon Weiss, the UN spokesman in Colombo, said that the UN refugee agency had raised the womens deaths with the Sri Lankan government and asked for female security officers to guard the womens bathing areas in the camps.         
	Theyve indicated that theyre going to do this, he told The Times. Sri Lankan officials were not immediately available for comment.

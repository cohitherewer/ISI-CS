	Strange titles    
	 London, Feb. 22: No one could argue they suffer from overly slick marketing.       
	 In fact with names such as Curbside Consultation of the Colon and Techniques for Corrosion Monitoring, it is a wonder they will sell at all. But they have been picked by The Bookseller Magazine for a shortlist of the strangest book titles published this year.      
	Diagram Prize for Oddest Book Title of the Year was devised in 1978 by Bruce Robertson from The Diagram Group, the illustrators, when he was bored at the Frankfurt Book Fair.      
	The titles also include Baboon Metaphysics, The Large Sieve and its Applications, Strip and Knit with Style.    
	Toilet loss    
	 Berlin (Reuters): A German businessman lost more than $13,000 in a plastic bag after forgetting the cash in a public toilet. The man took the money with him as he stopped to relieve himself in a motorway service station near Haiger. He then drove off. The police said it was not clear why the man took half an hour to notice his loss  by which time the money had gone.

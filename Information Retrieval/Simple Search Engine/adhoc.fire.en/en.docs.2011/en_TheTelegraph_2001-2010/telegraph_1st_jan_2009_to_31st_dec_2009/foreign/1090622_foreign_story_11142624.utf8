The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Bush or Obama? Maybe something else is at play
                                                                                                               Bush or Obama? Maybe something else is at play
          HELENE COOPER                          Obama                                  
	Washington, June 21: Could there be something to all the talk of an Obama effect, after all? A stealth effect, perhaps?        
	As the silent protests in Tehran dominated television screens, a peculiar debate in Washington erupted.         
	On one side, a handful of supporters of George W. Bush said Iranian protesters had taken to the streets because they were emboldened by the former US Presidents pro-democracy stance.         
	Some of Barack Obamas backers countered that the mere election of him in the US had galvanised reformers in Iran to demand change.        
	Both of those arguments gave the US an outsize role at the epicentre of an unfolding story that most experts, and many Iranians, said was actually not about America at all; it was about Iran and its own problems, notably a highly disputable vote count and the performance of its President, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad.        
	We have to be a little humble about our understanding about whats going on in Iran, said R. Nicholas Burns, a state department undersecretary for Bush. Theres been massive disappointment in Ahmadinejads stewardship over the years.        
	Even so, something else was also at play: the wistful comments of many Iranian protesters who dreamed of better relations with the world. That strand of thought was evident at the protest demonstrations on behalf of Ahmadinejads principal challenger, Mir Hussein Moussavi. Sign after sign at his rallies was emblazoned: A new greeting to the world.         
	Behind closed doors, most Iranian officials have long recognised that the death to America culture of 1979 is bankrupt, and that Iran will never achieve its enormous potential as long as relations with the US remain adversarial, said Karim Sadjadpour, an Iran expert at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. He and others argue that many Iranian pragmatists and moderates believe that their country in 2009 is facing a now-or-never moment.         
	If Tehrans hardliners are incapable of making nice with an American President named Barack Hussein Obama who preaches mutual respect and wishes them a happy Nowruz, its pretty obvious the problem is in Tehran, not Washington, Sadjadpour said.         
	During the Bush years, Irans regime was able to coalesce support by uniting the country against a common enemy: Bush, who called Iran a pillar of the axis of evil in a speech that alienated many of the very reformers whom the US was trying to woo.        
	The result, according to many experts in the US and Iran, was that Iranians, including reformers, united against the common enemy. Iranians with reformist sympathies even began advising Americans to stop openly supporting them, lest that open them to attack as pawns of America.         
	Obama seemed to be taking that kind of advice to heart last week. He kept his remarks about the Iranian election cool and detached.        
	On the other hand, he had already put in play the notion that this could be the best time in many years in which to seek better relations with America.

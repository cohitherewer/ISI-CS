The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | For older believers, Santa is ageless

	Washington, Dec. 24: Galen Henderson is 11 years old, and she believes in Santa Claus.        
	She is steadfast in this belief, despite taunts from other kids on the bus and in the cafeteria, who tell her: He cant possibly be real. Santa is a big fat fraud in a red suit. How could he get all those presents out to every child in the world in one night?        
	I hear it at school, mostly. I just say: Sure, if you think that, then you can think that, Galen said with an airy shrug.        
	She is certain they are wrong because she has met the real Santa at, of all places, a garden centre in Fairfax County, northern Virginia. She has been going to see him every Christmas since she was little. Last year, he remembered that her dogs name is Eli, and he brought her a Nintendo Wii game console her family could not afford.        
	Her conviction is shared by other late believers, a small but stubborn band of fourth-, fifth- and even sixth-graders who refuse to bow to conventional wisdom on the question of Santas existence. Like Galen, many eagerly wait in line for hours to see Santa at the Merrifield Garden Center in Falls Church, Virginia, each year.        
	Santa has been appearing there for more than 30 years and has a slavishly devoted cult following, with many families returning every holiday. He is a wonder to kids and parents alike, with a mysterious knack for intuiting a childs deepest desires and recalling details about their lives.        
	His ability to instantly summon the names of visitors he has not seen in a year or more attracts late believers in droves. Their legs droop nearly to the ground when they sit on his lap. Their scribbled wish lists go far beyond dolls and firetrucks to iPods and digital cameras.        
	Even the doubters find him difficult to explain. Or to resist.        
	Before Kate Nette, a 10-year-old from South Riding, Virginia, sat on Santas lap, she was full of scepticism. She had dismissed him as a guy in a suit who gets paid to be there. Then he asked how her field trip had been that day. As it happened, she had been on a field trip that day. Totally random, she told her cousin Daniel Nette, 12, afterward. Her doubt was wavering.

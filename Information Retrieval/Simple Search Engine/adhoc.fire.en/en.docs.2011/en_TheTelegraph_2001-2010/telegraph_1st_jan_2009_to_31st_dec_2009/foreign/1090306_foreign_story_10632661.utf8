	Orwell on fib list    
	 London, March 5 (Reuters): Two out of three Britons have lied about reading books they have not, and George Orwells 1984 tops the literary fib list, according to a survey published today.      
	Commissioned by organisers of World Book Day, an annual celebration of reading in Britain, the study also shows that the author people really enjoy reading is J.K. Rowling. According to the survey, 65 per cent of people have pretended to have read books, and of those, 42 per cent singled out 1984. Next on the list came War and Peace by Leo Tolstoy and in third place was James Joyces Ulysses.      
	The Bible was in fourth position, and President Obamas autobiography Dreams from My Father came ninth.      
	Aside from a list of 10 titles which respondents were asked to tick or leave blank, many admitted wrongly claiming they had read other classics including Jane Austen, the Bronte sisters, Charles Dickens, Fyodor Dostoyevsky and Herman Melville.    
	Dead wrong    
	 Des Moines, Iowa (Reuters): Lawmakers in Iowa on Wednesday raised some eyebrows when they voted to rename a department that deals with seniors, allowing it to carry the acronym DOA, which means dead-on-arrival. You cant have an acronym like this when youre referring to elderly people, Representative Dave Heaton, 68, said.

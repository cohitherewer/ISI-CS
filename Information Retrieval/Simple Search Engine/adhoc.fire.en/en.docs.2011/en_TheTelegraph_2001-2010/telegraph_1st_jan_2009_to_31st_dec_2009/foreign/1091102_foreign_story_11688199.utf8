The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Deal whiff in muted pullout by Abdullah
                                                                                                               Deal whiff in muted pullout by Abdullah
          K.P.NAYAR                            Abdullah; (top) Karzai                                 
	Washington, Nov.1: A day before Abdullah Abdullah, the runner-up in the first round of Afghanistans presidential election, announced his resolve on Sunday to pull out of the November 7 run-off vote, the impact of his drift towards such a decision was being felt in New Delhi.         
	Abdullah was to have been the star concluding speaker on the future of democracy in South Asia yesterday at a leadership summit organised by a New Delhi newspaper, but he abruptly dropped out of the conclave and cancelled his travel to India.         
	Whatever the eventual outcome Abdullahs decision to make the run-off a one-horse race with President Hamid Karzai as the sole candidate, it will dearly cost the Indian taxpayer who has a $1.2 billion stake in what happens in Afghanistan.         
	That is the amount India spends on aid to Afghanistan, modest from the standpoint of Afghan needs... large for a non-traditional donor like India, concedes foreign secretary Nirupama Rao.         
	Because public interest in last weeks trilateral meeting of foreign ministers of India, Russia and China held in Bangalore was excessively focussed on the troubled Sino-Indian relations, it did not register with most Indians that the three foreign ministers spent considerable time discussing events in Afghanistan, which are critical to all three countries.         
	The ministers emphasised the necessity of the international community maintaining its commitment to render assistance to the government and people of Afghanistan in ensuring security and development, and restoring peace and stability and building a democratic, pluralistic and prosperous Afghanistan, a joint communiqu at the end of the Bangalore meeting said.         
	They called for close cooperation between the International Security Assistance Force and the coalition forces and the government of Afghanistan in fighting this threat to regional stability and security.        
	India, Russia and China recognise that the threat to regional stability and security from what happens in the Afghan elections is very real.         
	The question of who was in power in Kabul was what led to the events surrounding the 1999 hijacking of an Indian Airlines plane, infiltration by Pakistan-Afghanistan-trained Uighur terrorists which is posing a serious problem for China and the attempt to destabilise Russia through Chechnya.         
	Signals from the Barack Obama administration at the time of writing are that Washingtons primary concerns too are on the lines of what was said in the Bangalore communiqu.         
	US Secretary of state Hillary Clinton said in Jerusalem that when President Karzai accepted a run-off without knowing what the outcome would be, that bestowed legitimacy (on the electoral process) from that moment.         
	About Abdullahs decision to withdraw, she said: I do not think it affects the legitimacy. I think it is his decision to make.        
	Given the numerous wheels within wheels around which Afghanistans complex political alliances are made and unmade, there was speculation that Abdullah was eventually seeking a power-sharing deal with Karzai by withdrawing from next weekends run-off.         
	At his news conference in Kabul to announce his withdrawal, Abdullah, significantly, asked his supporters not to take to the streets, not to feel aggrieved.         
	Abdullah stressed that he was not calling for a boycott of the second round of voting, did not criticise Karzai and said he would leave the door open for future discussions with the President, offering to remain at the service of the country.         
	Equally significantly, a statement by Karzais campaign refrained from criticising Abdullah, only saying they hoped to complete the election process with national unity and constitutional rule.

	Arnie to act again    
	 Los Angeles, Feb. 26: When Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger hears the word Cut! these days, it is generally coming from his own mouth, in reference to state expenditures, reports the New York Times News Service.      
	 Soon he could also hear it uttered by Sylvester Stallone, who is luring the governor back to the big screen in an action picture, The Expendables, in which the governor is expected to play himself.       
	Schwarzeneggers spokesman would not comment on whether he would be paid, but the state of California will not benefit much. The governors scene will be shot in Los Angeles, but the rest of the film will be made in Brazil and Louisiana, according to Stallones spokeswoman, Michelle Bega.      
	As part of Californias new budget, lawmakers passed a tax incentive for filmmakers to keep productions in the state. Schwarzenegger was an enthusiastic backer, insisting the problem of runaway production had too long been ignored by Hollywood. His spokesman, Aaron McLear, said, This governor has always pushed for films to be shot in this state.

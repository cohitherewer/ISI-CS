	Luzing out    
	 London, July 12 (PTI): Madonnas boyfriend Jesus Luz is upset with the fact that the singer has reforged her relationship with former husband Guy Ritchie.       
	The divorced couple are back on talking terms and spend a lot of time together. Many reports suggest that the thaw may be the beginning of a re-union. Although Madonna, 50, has banned Luz from speaking to his ex-girlfriends, the 22-year-old has made his displeasure over the fact that Ritchie is back in the family fold known to his friends, the Daily Mail has reported.      
	Guy is with Madonna a lot these days and was invited to a party at her house with some of their mutual friends last weekend. He goes to kabbalah meetings with Madonna and the kids, a source close to Luz told the daily.    
	Sex leaflets    
	 London: The National Health Service is advising British school pupils they have a right to an enjoyable sex life and that regular sex can be good for their cardiovascular health, reports The Sunday Telegraph. The advice appears in leaflets circulated to parents and teachers and is meant to update sex education by telling students about the benefits of enjoyable sex. The leaflet carries the slogan an orgasm a day keeps the doctor away. Steve Slack, one of the leaflets authors, said that instead of promoting teenage sex, it could encourage young people to delay losing their virginity until they were certain they would enjoy the experience.

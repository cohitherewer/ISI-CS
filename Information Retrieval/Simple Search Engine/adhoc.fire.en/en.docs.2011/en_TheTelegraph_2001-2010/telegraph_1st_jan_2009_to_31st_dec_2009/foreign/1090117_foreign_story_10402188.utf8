	New York, Jan. 16: America is marvelling at a miraculous combination in which a pilot emergency-landed an apparently geese-hit Airbus A320 in the icy Hudson river and a flotilla of vessels converged fast to pluck all 155 people aboard to safety.         
	The US Airways jetliner lost power in both engines after the bird-hit, within minutes of take-off from La Guardia Airport.         
	What might have been a catastrophe in New York  one that evoked the feel if not the scale of the September 11 attack  was averted by the pilots quick thinking and deft manoeuvres, and by the nearness of rescue boats, a combination that witnesses and officials called miraculous.         
	Passengers huddled on the wings in freezing air while those in the icy water went limp from the cold and would not have survived more than a few minutes, rescuers said.        
	As stunned witnesses watched from high-rise buildings on both banks, the Airbus A320, which had risen to 3,200ft over the Bronx and banked left, came downriver, its fuselage lower than many apartment terraces and windows, in a carefully executed touchdown shortly after 3.30pm on Thursday in the US.        
	On board, pilot Chesley B. Sullenberger III, 57, had made a command decision to avoid densely populated areas and try for the Hudson, and had warned the passengers to brace for a hard landing.         
	Most had their heads down as the jetliner slammed into the water, nose slightly up, three minutes after take-off on what was to be a flight to Charlotte, North Carolina.         
	The aircraft did not sink immediately. Instead, it floated, twisting and drifting south in strong currents as three commuter ferries moved in.         
	Moments later, terrified passengers began swarming out of the emergency exits into brutally cold air and onto the submerged wings of the bobbing jetliner, which began taking in water.        
	As the first ferry nudged up alongside, some passengers were able to leap onto the decks. Others were helped aboard by ferry crews.         
	Soon, a small armada of police boats, fireboats, tugboats and coast guard craft converged on the scene, and some of them snubbed up to keep the jetliner afloat. Helicopters brought wet-suited police divers.        
	Over the next hour, as a captivated city watched continuous television reports and the Hudson turned from gold to silver in the gathering winter twilight, all passengers, including at least one baby, and both pilots and all three flight attendants, were transferred to the rescue boats  a feat that unfolded as the white-and-blue jetliner continued to drift south.        
	Brought ashore on both sides of the river, the survivors were taken to hospitals in Manhattan and New Jersey, mostly for treatment of exposure to the cold water that many had stood in on the wings up to their waists.         
	Still, most of them walked ashore, some grim with fright and shivering with cold, wrapped in borrowed coats. But others were smiling, and a few were ready to give interviews to mobs of reporters.        
	Some described their survival as a miracle, a sentiment repeated later by city and state officials; others gave harrowing accounts of an ordeal whose outcome few might have imagined in such a crisis.        
	Even the aircraft was saved for examination  towed down the Hudson and tied up at Battery Park City.

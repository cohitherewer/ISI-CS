The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Senate panel backs Hillary
                                                                                                               Senate panel backs Hillary
                                      
	Washington, Jan. 15 (Reuters): Senator Hillary Clinton was approved by a Senate panel today to become the next US secretary of state, despite misgivings about the charitable fundraising of her husband, former President Bill Clinton.        
	The Senate Foreign Relations Committee voted 16-1 in favour of the appointment, clearing a key hurdle to her appointment as the top US diplomat. Clinton still has to be officially nominated and then confirmed by the full Senate but this is expected to be a formality. According to congressional staff this will take place Barack Obamas inauguration as president on Tuesday.        
	Senator David Vitter, who this week questioned Clinton about her husbands raising of foreign funds for his charity, was the sole negative vote.        
	Committee chairman Senator John Kerry said Clinton did an outstanding job in her testimony before the committee this week but noted some senators had expressed concerns about her husbands charitable foundation.

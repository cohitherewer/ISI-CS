	Rome, Dec. 26 (Reuters): An Italian toy store opened at 4am on a Christmas morning to help a frantic mother whose gifts for her children had been stolen from a basement.        
	After putting her two toddlers to bed on Christmas Eve, the mother went down to the basement storage room of the apartment block in northern Italy where she had hidden them, only to find that they had been stolen, according to Italian media reports.        
	Police found out about the theft while the mother was frantically making the rounds of all-night petrol stations looking for substitute gifts so her two daughters would have something under the tree when they woke up on Christmas morning.        
	The police contacted the owner of a toy store in a small town near Turin, who opened his store at 4am.

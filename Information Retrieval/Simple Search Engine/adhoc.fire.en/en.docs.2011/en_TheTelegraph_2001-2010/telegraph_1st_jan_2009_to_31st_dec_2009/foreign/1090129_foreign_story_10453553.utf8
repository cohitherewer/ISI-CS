The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Kidney donors not at risk, says study
                                                                                                               Kidney donors not at risk, says study
                            
	Boston, Jan. 28 (Reuters): Donating a kidney does not damage donors health or reduce their lifespan, and they are less likely to develop kidney failure than the general population, researchers reported today.        
	The study, the first large-scale examination of lifespan among donors, may encourage more kidney donations.        
	About 8,000 living donations are done in the US each year, according to the National Kidney Foundation.        
	Using data from 3,698 people who donated at the University of Minnesota from 1963 to 2007, Dr Hassan Ibrahim and colleagues found similar survival rates between donors and non-donors, while the risk of eventually developing kidney failure was one-third lower among the donors.        
	Donors have an excellent quality of life, the researchers reported in the New England Journal of Medicine.        
	The reason, Ibrahim said in a telephone interview, is probably because of the screening process. Kidney donors tend to be extremely healthy. Thats why they become donors. So we expected them to do well, he said.        
	The team also looked at other long-term measures of kidney health, such as the ability to filter out waste. We found that 85 per cent of kidney donors have excellent kidney function, he said. The rest had reasonable function.        
	Only 10 per cent had protein in the urine, indicating some underlying kidney damage.        
	Our message is that kidney donation is very safe provided that people who have high blood pressure, diabetes or who are overweight are not allowed to donate, Ibrahim said.        
	He cautioned against loosening the rules. If we start liberalising our criteria, we may not see the same results. Our commitment should be to the donor, to make sure theyre healthy and live a long life.

	Mingora (Pakistan), Feb. 17 (AP): Battle-weary residents welcomed a pro-Taliban cleric dispatched by the government today to convince militants in the former tourist haven of Swat to stop fighting.        
	In exchange, the government will impose Islamic law and suspend military offensives.        
	Sufi Muhammad arrived in a caravan of 300 vehicles in Swat Valleys main city of Mingora a day after he struck the truce, which a US defence official called negative and critics said represented a surrender to extremists fanning out from nearby strongholds.        
	We will soon open dialogue with Taliban. We will ask them to lay down their weapons. We are hopeful that they will not let us down, Muhammad told reporters. We will stay here in the valley until peace is restored.        
	Residents lined the route, waving and shouting: Long live peace! Long live Islam!        
	Extremists in Swat have beheaded opponents and torched scores of girls schools in recent months, while gunbattles between security forces and militants have killed hundreds.         
	Up to a third of the valleys 1.5 million people have fled and the scenic area is now believed to be mostly under militant control. The provincial government in northwest Pakistan announced the deal yesterday after it met Islamists led by Muhammad, who has long demanded that Islamic, or Shariah, law be followed in this conservative corner of Pakistan.         
	As part of the deal Muhammad agreed to travel to Swat and discuss peace with Maulana Fazlullah, the leader of the Swat Taliban and Muhammads son-in-law.        
	Muhammad was detained in 2002 after he sent thousands to fight US troops in Afghanistan, but Pakistan freed him last year after he agreed to renounce violence. It is unclear how much influence he has over Fazlullah or exactly where they would meet.        
	However, a spokesman for the Swat Taliban leader welcomed Muhammad and has spoken positively of the truce. The Swat Taliban said Sunday that they would observe an initial 10-day ceasefire in a show of good faith.  
	Nato warning        
	Nato warned today that Pakistan risked creating a safe haven for Islamist extremists after it struck a deal to impose Islamic law and suspend a military offensive in the Swat Valley.              
	Pakistans inability to re-establish its authority in Swat has embarrassed the shaky civilian government and the military. However, Pakistani leaders insisted the deal was not a concession, but an attempt to fulfill demands by locals for a more efficient justice system and forge peace.

                                                                                                               Mousavi defies top cleric
                            
	Tehran, July 1 (Reuters): Two losing contenders in Irans presidential election denounced the result today in clear defiance of Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, saying Mahmoud Ahmadinejads next cabinet would be illegitimate.        
	 Both men issued statements on their websites describing Ahmadinejads future government as illegitimate  even though Khamenei, the Islamic Republics ultimate arbiter, has upheld the result.

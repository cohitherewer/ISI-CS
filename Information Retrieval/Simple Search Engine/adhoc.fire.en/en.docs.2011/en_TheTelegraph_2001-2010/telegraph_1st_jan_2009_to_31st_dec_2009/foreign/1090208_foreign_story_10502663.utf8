	Daring dog    
	 Helena, Montana (AP) : A golden retriever named Buck that darted from his owners last summer after being spooked by a train whistle and went missing for six months is back home in Washington state, thanks to several residents of rural northcentral Montana. The 7-year-old dog survived despite apparently spending most of the winter exposed to heavy snow before he was found taking refuge under a collapsed building.

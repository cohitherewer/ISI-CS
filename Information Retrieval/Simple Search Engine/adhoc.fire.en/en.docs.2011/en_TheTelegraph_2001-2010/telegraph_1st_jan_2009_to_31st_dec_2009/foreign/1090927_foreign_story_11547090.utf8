	Peshawar, Sept. 26: At least 16 people were killed and 90 were injured in two suicide bombings in troubled areas of western Pakistan today.        
	Out of the 16, 10 were killed in Peshawar, the capital of the North Western Frontier Province (NWFP) and the first major city to be attacked in months.        
	The Peshawar attack targeted a commercial area less than a mile from the US consulate and near a private bank owned by the Pakistani military that had been hit before, said Liaqat Khan, the city police chief.        
	It came just hours after another bomber hit a police station in Bannu, a remote tribal area in northwestern Pakistan, killing five police officers and one prisoner, according to Malik Naveed, the NWFP inspector general.        
	The bombings appeared to be a calculated attempt by militants to strike back at the Pakistani military, which has been conducting a campaign against them since spring this year in northern and western Pakistan.        
	Naveed said the attacks appeared to be the work of the Taliban, but Khan warned that authorities had not yet determined the perpetrators. Police detained three suspects taking video at the scene in Peshawar.        
	It is premature to blame any group, Khan said. We want to keep our minds open.        
	Pakistan moved thousands of troops away from its eastern border with India to launch offensives against Taliban militants in the west of the country this spring, something the US had long pressured Pakistan to do.        
	The operations had achieved some success: civilian casualties in August reached their lowest level in more than a year, according to the Pakistan Institute for Peace Studies. Pakistans major cities, Lahore and Islamabad, which used to suffer near-weekly bombings, had been quiet for months.        
	The military was also helped by an American airstrike in August that killed Baitullah Mehsud, the leader of the Pakistani Taliban and the main perpetrator of attacks inside Pakistan.

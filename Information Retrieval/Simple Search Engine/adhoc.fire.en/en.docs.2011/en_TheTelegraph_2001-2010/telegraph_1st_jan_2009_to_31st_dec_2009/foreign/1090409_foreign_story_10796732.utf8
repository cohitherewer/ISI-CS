	Potter drugs    
	 London, April 8: Harry Potter actor Jamie Waylett, who played bullying Hogwarts pupil Vincent Crabbe, has been arrested after police allegedly found cannabis worth 2,000 in his bedroom, reports The Daily Telegraph.      
	Waylett was pulled over last week while driving in an Audi car in Westminster, central London, by police who believed he was behaving suspiciously.       
	A search of the car allegedly revealed eight bags of suspected cannabis, and Waylett and a friend, both 19, were arrested on suspicion of drug possession and taken to a nearby police station.       
	The actors home in Camden, north London, which he shares with his mother, Theresa, two brothers and a sister, was then raided and police allegedly seized ten mature cannabis plants.

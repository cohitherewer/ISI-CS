The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Gupta pulls out of race for US post
                                                                                                               Gupta pulls out of race for US post
          GARDINER HARRIS                          Dr Gupta: Family first                                  
	Washington, March 6: Dr Sanjay Gupta, CNNs chief medical correspondent and a practicing neurosurgeon, has withdrawn from being considered for surgeon general, CNN reported yesterday.        
	Several other candidates are now under serious consideration, including Dr Irwin Redlener, the director of the National Centre for Disaster Preparedness at Columbia University, according to people who have been briefed on the situation.        
	Dr Gupta had been approached by the Obama transition team and discussed the job with President-elect Barack Obama late last year in Chicago. An administration official said in an email message to reporters that Dr Gupta had been under serious consideration and added: We know he will continue to serve and educate the public..        
	Dr Guptas wife, Rebecca Olson Gupta, is expecting a child, and he wants to spend more time with his family and continue practicing medicine and serving as a CNN correspondent, the CNN anchor Wolf Blitzer said yesterday.         
	Dr Gupta presides over a small media empire that includes appearances on the CBS Evening News and columns in Time magazine. He published a book about the search for immortality in 2007. Dr Gupta is paid for speaking engagements, a controversial practice for a journalist.        
	The status and authority of the surgeon general, the titular chief of the US Public Health Service Commissioned Corps, has been waning for decades. The posts standing rose briefly under Dr. C. Everett Koop, whose fight against cigarette smoking gave the surgeon generals office national credibility and new life as a public health adviser.         
	Successive surgeons general, with small staffs and low profiles, have had mixed results in trying to capitalise on Dr Koops success.         
	Dr Richard Carmona, who was surgeon general from 2002 to 2006, testified before Congress in 2007 that the Bush administration had forced him to trumpet administration priorities.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Fire for UPA, no tears for Prachanda
                                                                                                               Fire for UPA, no tears for Prachanda
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, May 4: The BJP today welcomed the exit of Nepals Maoist Prime Minister and blamed the crisis partly on the UPA governments allegedly weak and flawed neighbourhood policies.        
	We will not drop tears for him (Prachanda), former foreign minister Yashwant Sinha said, arguing the Maoist leader had pushed Nepal into a corner where neither democracy nor development was possible.        
	Sinha, however, said India should be worried about the situation in Nepal. We have serious doubts about the continuance of the democratic process in Nepal. India needs to be worried about which direction Nepal would move now. New Delhi cannot remain a mute spectator.        
	Sinha, however, added that the BJP did not expect any positive intervention from this UPA government, which had outsourced its Nepal policy to the CPMs Sitaram Yechury.        
	The BJP has often expressed reservations about Maoist rule in Nepal and opposed the abolition of the monarchy. Even today, Sinha cited how a hoarding outside Kathmandu airport declared Nepal as the gateway to China.        
	Sinha alleged that the UPA governments ineptitude was to blame for Indias steady loss of influence among neighbours such as Nepal and Sri Lanka. The BJP, which had supported Nepals constitutional monarchy, appeared to take a somewhat different line today. Sinha said: We want democracy to be firm enough in Nepal so that it is not tampered with either by the Maoists or the monarchy.

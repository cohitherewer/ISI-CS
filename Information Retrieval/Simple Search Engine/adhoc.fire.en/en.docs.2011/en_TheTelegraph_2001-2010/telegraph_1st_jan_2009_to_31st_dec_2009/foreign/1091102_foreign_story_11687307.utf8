          NICK SQUIRES                          Silvio Berlusconi                                  
	Rome, Nov. 1: It is a tangled tale of sex, greed, ambition and blackmail in Silvio Berlusconis celebrity-obsessed Italy.         
	Fabrizio Corona, the strutting, self-styled king of the countrys paparazzi, faces more than seven years in prison after being charged with blackmailing a string of famous faces who came under his lens.         
	His lust for fame and fortune  and eventual downfall  is a telling fable of a country whose fascination with il mondo dello spettacolo, or showbusiness, makes Britains obsession with celebrity look modest by comparision.         
	Corona, 35, made a fortune by setting up a paparazzo photo agency with a small army of photographers who snapped Italian actors, actresses and football players in places, or with people, that they shouldnt have been.         
	Among the tens of thousands of pictures they took were some of the Italian Prime Ministers daughter, Barbara Berlusconi, 25, who reportedly paid Coronas agency 20,000 Euros for a series of grainy, long-range shots which showed her outside a Milan nightclub with a man who was not her then boyfriend.         
	Bizarrely, the pictures were later published in a glossy weekly magazine owned by her father, with Barbara insisting that they showed nothing compromising  begging the question of why she felt compelled to buy them in the first place.         
	The success of Coronas agency brought him a substantial fortune, smart cars, and a string of beautiful girlfriends  the latest of whom, Argentinian model Belen Rodriguez, 25, is one of the best known of Italys ubiquitous showgirls        
	There was, however, a devious twist to Coronas modus operandi. Instead of offering the pictures to tabloid newspapers and gossip magazines, he went straight to his targets, demanding money in return for the images not being sold for publication.         
	For a while, it was a devastatingly successful formula. I am like Robin Hood, Corona boasted in an interview before his arrest two years ago. I steal from the rich and I give to myself.         
	But last Wednesday, a prosecutor asked for him to be found guilty and sentenced to seven years and two months in prison, at the climax of a trial which threatens to bring his lucrative empire crashing down.                             THE SUNDAY TELEGRAPH

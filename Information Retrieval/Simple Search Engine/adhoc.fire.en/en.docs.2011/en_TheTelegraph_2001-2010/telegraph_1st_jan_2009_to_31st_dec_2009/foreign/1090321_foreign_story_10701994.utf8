The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | 90% tax on US bonuses
                                                                                                               90% tax on US bonuses
          SHAILAGH MURRAY, PAUL KANE AND DAVID CHO                              
	Washington, March 20: Congress moved yesterday to levy punitive taxes on bonuses paid by financial firms receiving government aid, threatening to undermine federal efforts to rescue the financial system by driving away participants in the programmes.         
	A quickly assembled House bill was approved 328 to 93. It struck hard at Wall Streets compensation system, which has come under fire because of the $165 million in bonuses distributed last week by American International Group to executives of the troubled unit that helped lead the insurance giant to the brink of collapse.         
	Under the legislation, those who received bonuses of more than $125,000 would surrender 90 per cent of their payments to a special income tax.         
	But the bills reach would extend to bonuses paid to tens of thousands of employees at the nations nine largest institutions that have received at least $5 billion in assistance under the $700 billion financial rescue package Congress approved last year.         
	Because virtually all Wall Street employees receive bonuses  in many cases making up the majority of their compensation  firms would rather back out of the governments rescue programmes than be subject to such harsh tax measures, industry officials said. The banks could still survive, but without federal assistance they would not have enough capital to restart lending.         
	Senate leaders aim to act next week on an even tougher bill that would affect all large banks that have received more than $100 million in asset relief payments.         
	Collecting the tax is not necessarily the intent of the measure, lawmakers and aides said yesterday. Some AIG employees have returned their bonuses, and some Democratic leaders said they may forgo the tax effort and turn to other measures already in the works to limit executive compensation at recipient firms.

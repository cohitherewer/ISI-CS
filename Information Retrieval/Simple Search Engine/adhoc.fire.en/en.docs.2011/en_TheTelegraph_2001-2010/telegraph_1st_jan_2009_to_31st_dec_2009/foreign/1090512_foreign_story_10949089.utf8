The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Star Trek beams to top of box office
                                                                                                               Star Trek beams to top of box office

	Los Angeles, May 11: Resistance proved futile: Star Trek, the Paramount Pictures prequel, sold an estimated $76.5 million in tickets at North American theatres in its first three and a half days of release, the top draw of the weekend.        
	The opening was propelled by a megawatt marketing campaign and unexpectedly strong critical notices. Going into the weekend, though, Paramount was a bit nervous about how the film, which cost $140 million, would perform.        
	Would the average moviegoer dismiss it as a geek flick? What about older women, an audience that has been tough for science fiction films to crack but is needed for a movie to reach blockbuster status? Historically Star Trek movies have performed poorly overseas. Would Paramounts harder-than-usual sell in Europe pay off?        
	Rob Moore, Paramounts vice-chairman, sounded giddy in an interview yesterday morning. A giant new audience came along for this ride, he said.        
	The studio, Moore said, thinks Star Trek, directed by J. J. Abrams and starring the newcomer Chris Pine as a young James T. Kirk, has a real shot to make more than $200 million domestically, a big number for a film with this size of opening weekend. Overseas, where sales information is slower to trickle in, Moore said Star Trek could sell more than $100 million in tickets, more than double the previous showing for the franchise.        
	Paramount executives said they had hoped the movie would perform like Batman Begins, the 2005 series reboot that opened to about $49 million in ticket sales. Helping Star Trek was the decision to start showing the movie in limited release on Thursday evening, a move meant to spur water-cooler talk in the office on Friday and give some padding to the weekend total.        
	Imax also helped boost results, selling an estimated $8.2 million of Star Trek tickets over the weekend, an Imax record. Weve never even been close to this kind of turnout before, said Greg Foster, chairman and president of Imax Filmed Entertainment.        
	In general the box office continues to sizzle. So far this year North American moviegoers have bought $3.44 billion in tickets, a 16 per cent increase over the same period in 2008, according to Hollywood.com. Attendance is up 13 per cent. X-Men Origins: Wolverine, had the years biggest opening last weekend.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | India, Pak nuke plans worry US
                                                                                                               India, Pak nuke plans worry US
          R. JEFFREY SMITH AND JOBY WARRICK                                    
	Washington, May 28: Sometime next year, at a tightly guarded site south of its capital, Pakistan will be ready to start churning out a new stream of plutonium for its nuclear arsenal.        
	It will eventually include warheads for ballistic missiles and cruise missiles capable of being launched from ships, submarines or aircraft.         
	About 1,609km to the southwest, engineers in India are designing cruise missiles to carry nuclear warheads, relying partly on Russian missile-design assistance. India is also trying to equip its Agni ballistic missiles with such warheads and to deploy them on submarines. Its rudimentary missile-defence capability is slated for a major upgrade next year.         
	The apparent detonation of a North Korean nuclear device on Monday has renewed concerns over that countrys efforts to build up its atomic arsenal. At the same time, US and allied officials and experts who have tracked developments in South Asia have grown increasingly worried over the rapid growth of the regions more mature nuclear programes, in part because of the risk that weapons could fall into the hands of terrorists.         
	India and Pakistan see their nuclear programmes as vital points of leverage in an arms race that has begun to take on the pace and diversity, although not the size, of US-Soviet nuclear competition during the Cold War, according to US intelligence and proliferation experts. Pakistani authorities said they are modernising their facilities, not expanding their programme; Indian officials in New Delhi and Washington declined to comment.         
	They are both going great guns [on] new systems, new materials; they are doing everything you would imagine, said a former intelligence official who has long studied the region.        
	While both India and Pakistan say their actions are defensive, the consequence of their efforts has been to boost the quantity of materials being produced and the number of times they must be moved around, as well as the training of experts in highly sensitive skills.         
	More vulnerabilities. More stuff in production. More stuff in transit, when it is more vulnerable to theft, said Rolf Mowatt-Larssen, formerly the CIAs top official on weapons of mass destruction.         
	Former Indian government officials say efforts are underway to improve and test a powerful thermonuclear warhead, even as the country adds to a growing array of aircraft, missiles and submarines that launch them. Delivery system-wise, India is doing fine, said Bharat Karnad, a former member of Indias National Security Advisory Board and a professor of national security studies at the Centre for Policy Research.

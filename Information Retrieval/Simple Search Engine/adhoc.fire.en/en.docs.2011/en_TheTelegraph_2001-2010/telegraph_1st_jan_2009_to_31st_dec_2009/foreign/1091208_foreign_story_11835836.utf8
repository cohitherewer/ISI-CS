	Police suspect the thieves tunnelled into the firms building in Sao Paulo and waited until yesterday afternoon, when the final games of the national championships were played, to break in and steal more than $5.7 million. A security guard working at the firm yesterday reported hearing loud noises but thought they were from fireworks lit by excited soccer fans.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Veil off Karzai crisis

  - Cabinet brawl echoes Wests growing misgivings        BEN FARMER AND DEAN NELSON                            Karzai (top) , Massoud: Infighting                                       
	Kabul, Feb. 22: Afghanistans President and Vice-President accused each other of being US stooges during a recent cabinet meeting which degenerated into a furious row, The Sunday Telegraph has learnt.         
	In a clash which showed how fragile the western-backed government has become, President Hamid Karzai was labelled a corrupt incompetent by his own understudy, Ahmad Zia Massoud. He responded in kind, saying Massoud was part of an American conspiracy to oust him.        
	The ferocity of the infighting reflects a collapse in support for the Afghan President  both within the Afghan coalitions who have supported him since his election in 2004, and among his backers in Britain, the US, the European Union and Nato.         
	Tensions erupted after Massoud made a speech blaming greed and corruption in the Karzai administration for the hunger and poverty in the country. He also said that Karzais plan to delay the May election until August 20 and extend his term until then was unconstitutional.        
	The row lasted for 10 minutes and had to be broken up by cabinet colleagues, who eventually moved the men onto the meetings business agenda.        
	In launching such a public attack, Massoud has joined a growing chorus of senior Afghan politicians questioning the legitimacy of President Karzais intention to remain in power after his term formally ends in May.         
	As the leader of the most powerful family in northern Afghanistan, and the brother of Ahmed Shah Massoud, a legendary Mujahideen general, Massouds comments are not to be lightly dismissed.        
	The Afghan constitution states elections should be held by late April, with the Presidents term finishing on May 21.         
	However, the Karzai-appointed independent election commission has said preparations cannot be finalised in time for April and the poll must wait three months for US troop reinforcements to bring security.        
	Opposition MPs fear that if Karzai remains in power during the three-month delay, he will use the state apparatus to bolster his campaign. Instead they are calling for a caretaker government led by someone not running for President.        
	Karzai has said he does not know whether his duty ends on May 21, or in December, five years after he was sworn in.        
	This week Massoud also criticised the President for keeping a stranglehold on decision making and said the Vice-Presidents were largely symbolic.        
	Only the decisions and recommendations which are according to the Presidents desire are put into practice, otherwise, they are kept on hold, he said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Obama orders Guantanamo end   Halt to harsh interrogations
                                                                                                               Obama orders Guantanamo end     Halt to harsh interrogations
                              Obama                                  
	Washington, Jan. 22 (Reuters): President Barack Obama today ordered the closure of the Guantanamo military prison within a year and a halt to harsh interrogation of terrorism suspects, moving quickly to restore the US image abroad.        
	The executive order to close the prison, a symbol of detainee abuse and detention without charge under the Republican administration of George W. Bush, fulfils a promise Obama made during his campaign.        
	The message that we are sending around the world is that the United States intends to prosecute the ongoing struggle against violence and terrorism and we are going to do so vigilantly, the new Democratic president said at a signing ceremony in the Oval office.        
	We are going to do so effectively and we are going to do so in a manner that is consistent with our values and our ideals, Obama said.        
	The President signed three executive orders. The first sets a deadline for closing the prison and kicks off a review process to deal with relocating, releasing or prosecuting the remaining detainees. It halts the military commissions set up to try prisoners and requires that conditions at the facility until its closure be humane.        
	Deciding to close the prison is simply the first step in a long, complicated process to determine the fate of its 250 inmates, many of whom have been held for years without trial. The US wants to try about 80 of the prisoners on terrorism charges.         
	A second order requires the CIA to close secret detention centres overseas that generated controversy in Europe, and prohibits creation of such sites in the future. It also mandates that interrogations of prisoners follow the US army field manual guidelines, which ensures that detainees get humane treatment under the Geneva Convention.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Buy American battle brews 
                                                                                                               Buy American battle brews 
          K.P. NAYAR                               
	Washington, Feb. 1: First there was a cry to restrict the entry of Indian and other H-1B foreign guest workers into America to lower the impact of the growing economic crisis on American labour. Now a pseudo-patriotic buy American zeal is sweeping Washington and threatening to restrict Indias rising exports to the US.        
	Close on the heels of the US labour-secretary designates declaration to limit H-1B visas to protect jobs for Americans, New Delhi is preparing to battle a clause in President Barack Obamas $900 billion economic recovery package that requires American steel and textiles to be used for government-funded projects.        
	The package passed by the US House of Representatives last week prohibits the use of iron and steel made abroad from being used in infrastructure projects that are to be launched as economic stimulus.        
	It also requires US-made uniforms to be used by Transportation Security Administration employees who manage security at all American airports. There are fears that such populist buy American demands may be extended as the $819 billion economic package passed by the House is expanded in the Senate version to $900 billion.        
	Trade has been one of the success stories in Indo-US friendship. From just $5.6 billion in 1990, bilateral trade in merchandise goods rose to $41.62 billion last year, a whopping increase of 743 per cent.        
	The US and China are now Indias top trading partners.        
	Textiles, the use of foreign-made ones to be restricted in Obamas stimulus package, rank second in Indias exports to America, accounting for 21.2 per cent, according to statistics for last year.        
	Steel exports from India have long been an irritant in Indo-US economic relations. Even during the preparations for Bill Clintons presidential visit to India nine years ago, when there were efforts to damp down differences, the US did not hesitate to penalise cut-to-length steel plates from India calculating dumping margins at 72.49 per cent, the highest that year for steel brought into America.        
	Industry lobbyists are furiously at work on Capitol Hill, cajoling Senators to include more protectionist clauses in that chambers version of the stimulus bill on behalf of sectors that account for jobs in their respective states.        
	Obama may be forced to give in, not only to garner enough votes in an increasingly sceptical Senate to pass the bill, but also as a populist and pseudo-patriotic slogan to retain his high approval ratings during a honeymoon phase for the new administration.        
	So far, only neighbouring Canada appears to have won a reprieve from the buy American provision in the US bill.        
	Canadas international trade minister Stockwell Day spoke to the acting US trade representative, Peter Allgeier, at the World Economic Forum in Davos and is said to have been promised that an exemption for Canadian iron and steel is being considered by the White House.        
	But in the case of Canada, Obama has the authority to waive the buy American provision on the ground that it violates pre-existing US trade obligations to Ottawa under the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA).        
	But India has no such shelter against US protectionism in the growing economic crisis here because although the two countries have created a big institutional framework for their economic engagement in recent years, it lacks the force of NAFTA-type legal guarantees.        
	Obama can, of course, waive provisions for other countries too if the protectionist clauses run counter to US commitments to the World Trade Organisation, but that will depend on the lobbying and pressure brought to bear on Capitol Hill and the White House by India and other countries.        
	The president of the US Chamber of Commerce, Thomas Donohue, warned in a statement that in 1930, when Congress approved the Smoot-Hawley tariffs, which raised duties on 20,000 imported goods to record levels, other countries responded by closing their markets to American products.        
	Those who dont know history are doomed to repeat it. Let us not make the same mistakes again, especially now, Donohue said in his statement opposing the buy American requirements.

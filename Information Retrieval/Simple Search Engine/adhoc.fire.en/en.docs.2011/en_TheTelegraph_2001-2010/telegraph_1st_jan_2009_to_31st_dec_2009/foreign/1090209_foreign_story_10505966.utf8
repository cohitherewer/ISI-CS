	Healesville, Australia, Feb. 8 (AP): Towering flames razed entire towns in south-eastern Australia and burned fleeing residents in their cars as the death toll rose to 84 today, making it the countrys deadliest fire disaster.        
	At least 700 homes were destroyed in yesterdays inferno when searing temperatures and wind blasts produced a firestorm that swept across a swath of the countrys Victoria state, where all the deaths occurred.        
	Hell in all its fury has visited the good people of Victoria, Prime Minister Kevin Rudd told reporters as he toured the fire zone today. Its an appalling tragedy for the nation.        
	Thousands of exhausted volunteer firefighters were still battling about 30 uncontrolled fires today in Victoria, officials said, though conditions had eased considerably.         
	It would be days before they were brought under control, even if temperatures stayed down, they said.        
	Government officials said the army would be deployed to help out. Rudd announced immediate emergency aid of $7 million.        
	The tragedy echoed across Australia. Leaders in other states  most of which have been struck by their own fire disasters in the past  pledged to send money and volunteer firefighters. Funds for public donations opened today quickly started swelling.        
	Witnesses described seeing trees exploding and skies raining ash yesterday as temperatures of over 47 degrees Celsius combined with blasting winds to create furnace-like conditions.        
	The scene was utter devastation today in at least two regions  the town of Marysville and several hamlets in the Kinglake district.        
	Streets were lined by smouldering wrecks of homes; roofs collapsed inward, iron roof sheets twisted from the heat. The burned-out hulks of cars dotted roads. Here and there, fire crews filled their trucks from ponds and sprayed down spot fires. There were no other signs of life.        
	Even from the air, the landscape was blackened as far as the eye could see. Entire forests were reduced to leafless, charred trunks, farmland to ashes.         
	Dozens of fires were also burning in New South Wales state, where temperatures remained high for the third consecutive day. Properties were not under immediate threat.

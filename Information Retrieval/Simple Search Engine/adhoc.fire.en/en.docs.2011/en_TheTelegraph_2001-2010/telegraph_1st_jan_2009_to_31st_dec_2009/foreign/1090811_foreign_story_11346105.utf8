The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Court tells police to file FIR against Pervez
                                                                                                               Court tells police to file FIR against Pervez
          
	Islamabad, Aug. 10 (PTI): A Pakistani court today asked the police to register an FIR against former President Pervez Musharraf for illegally detaining 60 judges after imposing emergency in 2007.        
	District and sessions judge Akmal Raza issued the order here after lawyer Aslam Ghuman filed an application asking for a case to be registered against Musharraf, who is currently in Europe.         
	This is the first time that a court has asked police to register a case against Musharraf.         
	Several persons, including relatives of people detained by intelligence agencies, have urged the police to register cases against Musharraf. However, the officials have been reluctant to act against the former army chief.         
	In his application, Ghuman accused Musharraf of illegally detaining over 60 judges, including Supreme Court Chief Justice Iftikhar Chaudhry, after imposing the emergency. Ghuman said he had filed a complaint with a local police officer but no action was taken.        
	The judge ordered that the case should be registered by the Secretariat police station in the heart of Islamabad. Ghuman later visited the station, where an officer accepted his application and recorded his statement. The officer said the FIR would be registered once the police station received the courts order.

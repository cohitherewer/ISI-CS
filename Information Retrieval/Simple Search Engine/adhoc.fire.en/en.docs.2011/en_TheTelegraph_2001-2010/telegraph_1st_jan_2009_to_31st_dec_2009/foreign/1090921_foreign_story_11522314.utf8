The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Delicate shove to NY governor
                                                                                                               Delicate shove to NY governor
                            
	Washington, Sept. 20: President Barack Obama has sent a request to governor David A. Paterson that he withdraw from the New York governors race, fearing that Paterson cannot recover from his dismal political standing.        
	The move against a sitting Democratic governor represents an extraordinary intervention into a state political race by the President, and is a delicate one, given that Paterson is one of only two African-American governors in the country.        
	But Obamas political team and other party leaders have grown increasingly worried that the governors unpopularity could drag down Democratic members of Congress in New York.        
	The general election is more than a year away, but Obama is moving now in part because of signals from Rudolph W. Giuliani, the former New York City mayor, that the Republican may run for governor.        
	The relationship between Obama and Paterson has been shaky, dating to the governors selection of a replacement for Hillary Rodham Clinton, who resigned from the Senate to become secretary of state.        
	The governor had publicly snubbed Caroline Kennedy, Obamas close personal friend, who announced her wish to be chosen as Clintons replacement, but withdrew her name from consideration in January, citing personal reasons.

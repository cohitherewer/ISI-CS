The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Rival gives Hasina a chance
                                                                                                               Rival gives Hasina a chance
                            
	Dhaka, Jan. 1 (Reuters): Sheikh Hasina consulted party leaders today over her cabinet and officials said the outgoing interim government would likely transfer power next week.        
	Hasina, a former Prime Minister, looks set for another chance at leading the country after her Awami League and its allies won an overwhelming victory in the parliamentary election on Monday.        
	Her rival Begum Khaleda Zia, another ex-Prime Minister, has rejected the result saying the vote was widely rigged, raising fears of violent protests.        
	By today, however, Khaledas camp said they wanted to give Hasina a chance to govern.        
	We know beyond any doubt the election was rigged and results were tailored, BNP secretary-general Khandaker Delwar Hossain said today. Yet we would like to give the Awami League a chance to rule and prove its efficiency.        
	International monitors say the vote was fair and credible.        
	One of Hasinas party leaders, who declined to be identified, said she would likely avoid picking old faces for the cabinet and select some new and younger ministers.        
	This will reflect her desire for change, the source said.        
	Another official said the army-backed interim government aimed to transfer power late next week. Hasinas Awami League said it wanted the transition to be completed before January 10.        
	The Awami League and its allies won more than two-thirds of the parliaments 300 seats in Bangladeshs first election in seven years.         
	Hasina has said there are many challenges ahead, such as curbing poverty, fighting militancy and boosting the economy. Some 45 per cent of the population live below the poverty line.        
	Hasina said she was ready to offer senior parliamentary posts to Khaleda and her party, and even a few ministerial positions as well, if they cooperated with her new government.        
	Analysts said cooperation would be a plus for the business climate and ease fears the military might take over again.        
	Hasina will also have to address the issue of war crimes.        
	Hasina discussed war crimes with Ian Martin, special representative of the UN secretary-general to Nepal, in Dhaka today.        
	Martin, on a private visit, assured Hasina of UN cooperation in arranging trial of war criminals if the Bangladesh government would request so, Mohammad Zamir, Hasinas foreign affairs adviser, said.

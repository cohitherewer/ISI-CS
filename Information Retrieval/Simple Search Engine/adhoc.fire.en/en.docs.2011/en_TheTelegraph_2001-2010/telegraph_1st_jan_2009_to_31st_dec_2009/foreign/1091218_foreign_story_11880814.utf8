	Theron close call    
	Los Angeles, Dec. 17 (PTI): Actress Charlize Theron is convinced that the casting couch culture is rampant in Hollywood after she nearly fell victim to it when she was a struggling actress.      
	The South African star moved to California at the age of 19 to fulfil her dream of becoming an actress. However, Theron, who won the best actress Oscar for her role in Monster, admits that she saw the darker side of Hollywood first hand, reports OK! magazine.      
	I thought it was a little odd that the audition was on a Saturday night at his house in Los Angeles, but I thought maybe that was normal. He was in his Hugh Hefner pyjamas, I go inside and hes offering me a drink, and Im thinking, my God this acting stuff is very relaxed, Theron said.       
	But it soon becomes very clear what the situation was. I was like: Not going to happen! Got the wrong girl, buddy!, she added.     
	Keira stage    
	London (PTI): Actress Keira Knightley almost backed out of acting on the West End stage in London as she was scared of being burned alive by her critics.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Pay caps for executives

	Washington, Feb. 4 (AP): President Barack Obama today announced $500,000 pay caps for financial executives whose firms take federal bailout money, responding to public outrage over fat paychecks for the leaders of companies on the government dole.        
	The President was reacting in part to reports last week that Wall Street firms shovelled out more than $18 billion in 2008 year-end bonuses even as the industry took billions in government rescue money to prevent a feared collapse of the US financial system.        
	We all need to take responsibility. And this includes executives at major financial firms who turned to the American people, hat in hand, when they were in trouble, even as they paid themselves their customary lavish bonuses, a stern Obama said in the White House foyer.        
	A White House statement issued in conjunction with the announcement said the new regulations would ensure that executive pay in the financial community is closely aligned not only with the interests of shareholders and financial institutions, but with the taxpayers providing assistance to those companies.         
	Obama used the ceremony announcing the new pay regulations to push back against Republicans in Congress who have fought his $800-plus billion spending plan, saying it should focus more heavily on tax cuts.        
	I reject that theory, and so did the American people when they went to the polls in November and voted resoundingly for change. So I urge members of Congress to act without delay, Obama said.        
	The pay cap would lay the ground for next weeks unveiling of a new framework for spending the money that remains in the $700 billion financial rescue fund, established late last year by the former Bush administration.        
	Spending of the first half of the measure has come under heavy criticism for focusing too heavily on bank and financial institution bailouts and too little on helping millions of homeowners facing foreclosure of home mortgages.

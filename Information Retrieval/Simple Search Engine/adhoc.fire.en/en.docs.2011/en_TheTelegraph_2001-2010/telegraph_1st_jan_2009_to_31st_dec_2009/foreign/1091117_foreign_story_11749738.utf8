	London, Nov. 16 (Reuters): Counter-terrorism detectives said they had arrested five men today in early morning raids in northwest England.        
	They were being held on suspicion of committing terrorism offences including inciting an act of terrorism overseas. Police said the suspects, aged 21, 26, 27, 52 and 62, were detained after swoops at homes in Manchester and Bolton, and at a hotel near Londons Heathrow Airport.         
	There was no direct threat against Greater Manchester and the arrests are the latest stage of a thorough investigation, said Assistant Chief Constable Dave Thompson.        
	This is a complex and ongoing investigation which has now reached the point where it was necessary to make arrests and speak to a number of people. In April, police carried out raids across northwest England in an operation Prime Minister Gordon Brown described at the time as avery big terrorist plot.

	Islamabad, April 23: The fall of Buner to Taliban does not mean the militant group can immediately threaten Islamabad, 100km away, but it is another indication of the gathering strength of the insurgency.        
	It also raises new alarm about the ability of the Asif Ali Zardari government to fend off an unrelenting Taliban advance towards the heart of Pakistan.         
	Buner, home to about one million people, is a gateway to a major Pakistani city, Mardan, the second largest in the North West Frontier Province, after Peshawar. They take over Buner, then they roll into Mardan and thats the end of the game, a senior official in North West Frontier Province said.        
	The Taliban had pushed into the district from the neighbouring Swat Valley, where the Pakistani army agreed to a truce in mid-February and remains in its barracks.         
	Heavily armed Taliban militants were patrolling villages in Buner yesterday, and police had retreated to their station houses. The staff members of non-governmental organisations have been ordered to leave, and their offices have been looted.        
	The Taliban advance has been building for weeks, with the assistance of sympathisers and even a local government official who was appointed on the recommendation of the Taliban. It also comes 10 days after the government agreed to the imposition of Islamic law in Swat.        
	The takeover of Buner (pronounced boo-NAIR) is particularly significant because the people there have tried in the past year to stand up to the Taliban by establishing small private armies to fight the militants. Last year, when the militants encroached into Buner, the people fought back and forced the militants out.        
	But with a beachhead in neighbouring Swat, and a number of training camps for fresh recruits, the Taliban were able to carry out what amounted to an invasion of Buner.        
	Yesterday, Jamsher Khan, a local politician, said people were initially determined to resist the Taliban in Buner, but they were discouraged by the deal the government struck with the Taliban in Swat.        
	One of the major concerns is that from the hills of Buner the Taliban have access to the flatlands of the district of Swabi, which lead directly to the four-lane motorway that runs from Islamabad to Peshawar, the capital of North West Frontier Province.         
	The Pakistani military does not have a presence in Buner, officials said. The main government authority in Buner is the police force, which have become demoralised by low pay and lack of equipment. One of the big attractions of Buner for people from all over Pakistan, the shrine of the Sufi saint Pir Baba, was now in the control of the militants.

                              Tomaz Humar                            
	Ljubljana (Slovenia), Nov. 14 (AP): A veteran Slovenian climber was found dead in the Himalayas today days after he was injured and stranded on a 7,227-metre mountain, a rescue company and a close friend said.        
	Gerold Biner, flight operations manager for the respected Swiss Air Zermatt company, said that Tomaz Humars body was recovered early today by a three-man rescue team. They called me ... to tell me the rescue mission was over, Biner said.        
	Humar, 40, last contacted his base on Monday to say that he was injured while climbing Langtang Lirung.        
	Viki Groselj, a fellow Slovenian mountaineer and a good friend of Humar, said Humar had broken his leg and become stranded.

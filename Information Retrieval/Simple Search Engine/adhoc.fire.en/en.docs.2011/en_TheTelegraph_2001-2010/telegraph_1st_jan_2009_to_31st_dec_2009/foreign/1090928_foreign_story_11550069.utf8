The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | NY goes nuts over coconut
                                                                                                               NY goes nuts over coconut
          SARAH MASLIN NIR                              
	New York, Sept. 27: The odd whitish spheres resting in a tray of ice on Bedford Avenue in Brooklyn were strange enough to make passers-by do a double take.        
	Strolling down the street, Martin Mancusi, 30, a tourist from Barcelona, and his friend Alejandro Kaed, 33, stopped to examine the items: young peeled coconuts, waiting to be pierced by a straw and sipped by someone young and fashionable, as they have been all summer.        
	The young coconut and its juice is the latest formerly humble food to be discovered by New York Citys style set, and elevated  if not quite to the level of a status symbol  at least to that of a prized accessory.        
	In the last few months, retailers in hipster hot spots say they have sold unprecedented amounts of the fruit for streetside consumption.        
	I think its stylish, its pretty, said Zarifeh Saleh, who owns Bedford Avenue Fruits and Vegetables with her husband, Ayman Ismail. You feel like youre on the beach, but youre not on the beach.         
	Across the street at Bedford Avenue Health Food, owner Mahdi Matany said that since he began carrying them in April, he sells six cases of nine coconuts each every warm weekend. Ismail and Saleh say they sell up to 10 cases.        
	Some say the public ritual is part of the drinks allure. I dont ever go and buy a bunch of coconuts and stock them and drink them at home, said Jennifer Verdon, 30, a band manager who lives on the Lower East Side.        
	Others, like Fiona Byrne, 32, a music journalist who said she averages two coconuts a week, insist they drink the juice  which is prized for its nutrients  purely for health reasons.        
	Its not a statement, Byrne said. Walking around New York, it doesnt feel really tropical, it just feels like a necessity. The coconuts usually cost $2 to $4 each.        
	Cracking a coconut and drinking its contents has long been a practice in the citys South Asian and Hispanic communities. And coconut water marketed as a natural sports drink has been in stores for the last several years.         
	But young people walking around the city toting a three-pound coconut that is usually relegated to the beaches of Phuket seems to be a new phenomenon.        
	David Perez, general manager of Best Oriental Produce, a main supplier of Bedford Avenues coconuts, said that for the last two years the company had imported double the number of drinking coconuts than it used to  up to a half-million cases of fruit annually. Originally, he said, the company catered towards the Asian market.        
	So its nothing new, he said of coconuts in the city. What is new, he said, is crossing it over.        
	Women make up the majority of coconut buyers, Matany said, and the incongruence of a tropical drink on an urban street often gets strangers chatting.        
	People always ask you what youre drinking, said Verdon, the band manager. It starts conversation.

	Washington, April 30: A member of the security advance team for President Obamas recent trip to Mexico is suspected of having contracted the swine flu and transmitted it to his family in Anne Arundel County, the White House said today.         
	The man is on the staff of energy secretary Steven Chu, who travelled with Obama to Mexico on April 16. He appears to have transmitted the virus to his wife, son and nephew, press secretary Robert Gibbs said.         
	He added that the President has not been affected by the virus and said White House doctors say he does not need to be tested.         
	Maryland health officials announced test results yesterday showing that an Anne Arundel County woman and two children were among six probable victims of the flu whose preliminary test results have been sent to the federal Centres for Disease Control and Prevention to be confirmed.         
	Gibbs said the administration employee himself did not test positive for the virus, likely because he had already recovered completely by the time he underwent the tests. He has returned to work, Gibbs said.         
	Last night, the World Health Organisation raised the global flu alert level to 5, the second highest phase that indicates a pandemic is imminent. I have decided to raise the level of influenza pandemic alert from phase 4 to phase 5, WHO director-general Margaret Chan told a news briefing about the swine flu outbreak. The world is better prepared for an influenza pandemic than at any time in history, Chan said. For the first time in history we can track the pandemic in real time.        
	A World Bank employee who lives in Maryland but also was recently in Mexico  where the disease is believed to have originated  also has tested positive in a preliminary screening, bank officials said today. So have three people in Baltimore County.         
	Delaware health officials say they have confirmed four cases of the virus at the University of Delaware, and have sent probably positive results for 12 other individuals to the CDC.         
	None of the local cases are believed to be life-threatening, and some victims, such as the World Bank employee, have already made a full recovery.         
	The World Bank said its employee came to work in downtown Washington on April 20, after being exposed to the virus on a business trip to Mexico but before the epidemic was publicly known. To limit the spread of the disease, the World Bank said, about 80 bank employees who may have come into contact with the infected man have been told to work from home until officials determine who should be tested.         
	The President was in Mexico for less than 24 hours en route to the three-day Summit of the Americas in Trinidad and Tobago. A museum official who escorted Obama through an anthropological exhibit died of health problems unrelated to the flu a week later, and White House officials earlier this week went to great lengths to explain that the Presidents health was never in any danger.        
	He has not exhibited any symptoms; neither has anybody travelling with him, White House press secretary Robert Gibbs said on Monday.         
	Mexico shutdown        
	Mexicans braced for a national shutdown of offices, restaurants and schools in an attempt to slow the spread of the disease.         
	In nationally televised speech last night, the Mexican President, Felipe Calder, said many public services would be closed from Friday to Tuesday. Most government offices and many private businesses will be ordered closed, restaurants, schools and museums will remain shut.

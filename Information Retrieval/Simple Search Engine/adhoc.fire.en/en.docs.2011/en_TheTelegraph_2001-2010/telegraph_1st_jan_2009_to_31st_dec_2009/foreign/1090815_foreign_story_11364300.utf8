	London, Aug. 14: A woman has apparently been sacked after abusing her boss on Facebook  forgetting that he could read her comments because they were friends on the networking website.        
	The worker, known only as Lindsay, updated her Facebook status with OMG [oh my God] I HATE MY JOB!! She went on to accuse her boss of being pervvy (sic) and complained that she was forced to do **** stuff.        
	Four hours later, her boss Brian posted a reply under her remarks reminding her that he could read her comments and that he would put her P45 in the post. He mocked her for forgetting that she had added him as a friend on the website  meaning that he could access everything that she wrote  and said that she was unable to carry out the simplest of tasks.

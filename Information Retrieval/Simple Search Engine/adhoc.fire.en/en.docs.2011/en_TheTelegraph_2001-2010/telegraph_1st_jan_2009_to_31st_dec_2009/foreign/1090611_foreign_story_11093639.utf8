                                                                                                               NRI patient dies after banned doctor error
                            
	London, June 10: An NRI woman bled to death after a surgeon, who had previously been banned from carrying out spinal surgery, damaged an artery attached to her heart during a routine operation an inquest heard.         
	Satwant Vohra, 55, died after the operation at a private hospital on a damaged disc in her back. Surgeon Chinh Nguyen, 43, who worked privately with football star Thierry Henry, was jailed for five years for laundering millions in profits from a network of cannabis farms last month.        
	Before the operation Nguyen had been temporarily suspended from performing open spinal surgery after concerns were raised about his ability.        
	Nguyen, acknowledged that he may have injured Vohras aorta at the Garden Hospital in Hendon, north London, in December last year. An inquest in Hornsey, north London, heard that Vohra, a sub-post mistress from Welwyn, Hertfordshire, started to deteriorate in the hours after the operation.        
	She was taken to the NHS-run Whittington Hospital for emergency surgery but doctors were unable to stem the bleeding. Nguyen had been stopped from performing open spinal surgery from May 2007 until May 2008 after concerns were raised over five cases.

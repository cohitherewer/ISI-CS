The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | 10 killed in Rawalpindi suicide bombing
                                                                                                               10 killed in Rawalpindi suicide bombing
                            
	Islamabad, March 16 (AP): A suicide bomber blew up at a busy bus terminal near the Pakistani capital today, killing at least ten people and wounding 20 more, officials said.        
	The blast came as Pakistans leaders sought to end a political crisis that has raised doubts about their focus on fighting Islamist militants blamed for a string of similar bombings in Pakistan and Afghanistan.        
	Television images from the Rawalpindi showed rescue workers helping the wounded to ambulances while gloved investigators picked debris from a darkened street among several badly damaged cars and minibuses.        
	Police official Nasir Durrani said rescue workers recovered 10 corpses from the scene, including remains believed to be those of the bomber.         
	Officials had warned of possible suicide attacks in Pakistani cities in the run-up to recent anti-government protests.        
	A final mass rally planned for Islamabad today was called off after the government agreed to demands to restore senior judges ousted from the supreme court.        
	Rehman Malik, the head of Pakistans interior ministry, said it was unclear if the bomber deliberately targeted the teeming bus terminal that was hit late today or if the explosives went off prematurely.        
	No group claimed responsibility and there was no indication of what other target the bomber may have been heading for.

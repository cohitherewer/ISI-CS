The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | President for quick jolt to economy
                                                                                                               President for quick jolt to economy
                            
	Washington, Jan. 24: President Barack Obama yesterday stepped squarely into the fractious effort in Congress to assemble an $825-billion economic recovery package, seeking to quell criticism from both parties and to retain leadership on an initiative that could define his term.        
	For the first time as President, Obama also met the leaders of both parties in Congress, in keeping with his campaign promise of bipartisanship. Yet in a polite but pointed exchange with the number two House Republican, Eric Cantor of Virginia, Obama took note of the parties fundamental differences on tax policy towards low-wage workers, and insisted that his view would prevail.        
	At issue is Obamas proposal that his tax breaks for low- and middle-income workers, including his centerpiece Making Work Pay tax credit, be refundable  which means that the benefits also go to workers who earn too little to pay income taxes. Republicans generally oppose giving such refunds to people who pay no income taxes. We just have a difference here, and Im President, Obama said to Cantor.

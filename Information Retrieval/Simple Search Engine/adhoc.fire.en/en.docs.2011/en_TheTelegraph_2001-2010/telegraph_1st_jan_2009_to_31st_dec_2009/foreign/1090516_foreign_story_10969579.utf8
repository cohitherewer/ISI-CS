The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Hackers target Facebook
                                                                                                               Hackers target Facebook
                            
	Boston, May 15 (Reuters): Hackers launched an attack on Facebooks 200 million users yesterday, successfully gathering passwords from some of them in the latest campaign to prey on members of the popular social networking site.        
	Facebook spokesman Barry Schnitt said yesterday that the site was in the process of cleaning up damage from the attack. He said that Facebook was blocking compromised accounts. He declined to say how many accounts had been compromised.        
	The hackers got passwords through what is known as a phishing attack, breaking into accounts of some Facebook members, then sending emails to friends and urging them to click on links.

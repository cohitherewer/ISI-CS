                              Back to the future                            
	London, Dec. 26 (PTI): She is one of the most glamorous women in Hollywood, but actress Eva Longoria has decided to pile on the pounds and add some wrinkles to her smooth face all for her role in the hit TV drama Desperate Housewives.        
	New pictures from a coming episode show Longorias character Gaby Solis 30 years into the future as a poverty-striken, grey-haired grandmother.        
	With long grey hair, wrinkles and dowdy clothes, the beautiful actress is barely recognisable, reports the Daily Mail.        
	 The flash forward also has not been kind to Longorias co-star Teri Hatcher. Stick-thin Hatchers character Susan Meyer has eaten herself into obesity.         
	Longorias character has already undergone a transformation. First she was ordered to put on weight when she was transformed into a mother.        
	The actress recently announced that she plans to launch her signature perfume called Eva by Eva Longoria.        
	The 34-year-old actress, who is also the LOreal brand ambassador has delved deeper into the beauty segment with the help of the perfume which was developed by Falic Fashion Group and will be launched in the US in spring next year.

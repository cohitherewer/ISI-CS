	London, Sept. 8: To gossip is to be human, a scientist claims.        
	Nicholas Emler, a social psychologist, said it was fundamental to being human and was the reason we developed our unique ability to talk. He believes it is what separates us from the rest of the animal kingdom. Speaking at the British Science Festival, he claimed that language was developed to allow us to share social information, effectively to gossip. But despite its dismal reputation this was not a bad thing as it allowed us to build far bigger, richer and complex societies than other creatures.        
	Emler, of the University of Surrey, said: The one thing that sets us apart is that we can talk to each other.

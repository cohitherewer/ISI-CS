	Washington, Jan. 20: Barack Obama took office today with a realistic prospect of joining the ranks of historys most powerful Presidents.         
	The more familiar observation, that he confronts daunting trials, enhances that prospect. Emergencies have always brought commensurate new authority for the Presidents who faced them, not only because the public demanded action but also because rival branches of government went along.         
	Obama arrives with a rare convergence of additional strengths, some of them inherited and some of his own making. Predicting a presidency, to be sure, is hazardous business, and much will depend on Obamas choices and fortune. But historians, recent White House officials and senior members of the incoming team expressed broad agreement that Obama began his term in command of an office that is at or near its historic zenith.        
	The opportunity is there for Obama to recast the very nature of the presidency, said Sean Wilentz, a presidential historian at Princeton. Not since Reagan have we had as capable a persuader as Obama, and not since FDR has a President come in with quite the configuration of foreign and domestic crises that open up such a possibility for the reconstruction of the executive.         
	No President has begun his term with so broad a wave of public confidence  78 per cent approval in the most recent Gallup poll.        
	 If Obama keeps the loyalty of the online social networks he used to win election, with unprecedented success in fundraising and recruiting, his White House could be the first to harness a meaningful grass-roots movement as an ongoing tool of governance.         
	The federal government itself is a far more potent instrument, in its breadth and depth of command over national life, than it has ever been before.         
	Largely in response to the threat of terrorism, the Bush years and President Bill Clintons two terms saw an incredible period of state-building thats unrivalled in American history except by the creation of the national security state in the 1940s and 50s, said Jack Balkin, a professor of constitutional law at Yale whose blog, Balkinization, is often cited by the Obama team.        
	By necessity or design, and most often by passive acquiescence, Congress and the courts have let Presidents do most of the steering of the new and expanded institutions that govern finance, commerce, communications, travel, energy production and especially intelligence gathering. When there were struggles for dominance among the three branches, most of them ended with lopsided victories for the executive.         
	The legislative power to declare war and ratify treaties, for example, has been deeply eroded by the practice of Presidents to launch military operations on their own and to make major international commitments by executive agreement rather than by treaty requiring a two-thirds Senate vote.         
	Really, in the last 80 years weve seen a gradual, and at times not gradual, concentration of power in the executive office, said William P. Marshall, who served as deputy White House counsel under Clinton.         
	Obamas style of governance will not be President George W. Bushs, but it may not differ quite as much as some supporters expect.        
	Bush defined his power as supremacy over Congress and courts. Obama has pledged to take greater heed of Congress, but he has not disowned the broader assertion that a President may disregard a statute or judges ruling.         
	John D. Podesta, a former White House chief of staff who led the new administrations transition team, was careful to distinguish between Obamas promise to keep the dialogue with Congress and his willingness to compromise on core objectives.        
	Political power gives him the capacity, I suppose, to kind of roll over his opposition, but what hes shown is a keen understanding that lots of change comes when you have dialogue, reach out to Congress and take account of it. Thats not to say hell adjust the goals that he laid before the public in the election.         
	The very ambition of Obamas programme, which has grown in proportion to the scale of the global economic collapse, augurs a potentially transformative term in office. Bushs agenda was aggressively expansionist when it came to national security and to his own autonomy as President, but in many spheres he aimed to diminish governments role.         
	There were exceptions, but the central plank of Bushs domestic programme called for reducing the governments share of national income and its role as regulator of the environment, free markets and civil rights.         
	Now there is broad acceptance of a rescue package that comes close to nationalising large swaths of the private economy.         
	Even in its first iteration, the governments $700 billion expenditure to shore up US financial systems will rival the roughly $1 trillion a year in discretionary federal spending. Obama has spoken elliptically of the prospect that the cost could double.         
	Congress has made little pretence of managing these vast expenditures. It will fall to Obama to decide winners and losers in the banking, financial services, automobile and other major industries, a span of control that dwarfs President Harry S. Trumans attempt to seize control of steel production.         
	Obama advisers are aware of the risks of taking on too many tasks at once or of provoking a backlash with too muscular a claim of authority.        
	Obviously you want to avoid squandering power, and you want to avoid any sense that youre abusing power, said a top-ranking member of the new White House staff.         
	But the greatest risk, as the new team sees it, is not in tackling too much. Said Podesta: The danger is in undershooting rather than overreaching, given the problems the country is facing.

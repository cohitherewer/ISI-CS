The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Pak political rift poses test for Obama

	Islamabad, Feb. 28: The intensifying political battle between the pro-American President and the main Opposition leader is shaping up as a potential crisis for the Obama administration as it tries to focus the government on fighting the al Qaida and Taliban insurgency here.        
	The domestic struggle will almost certainly deflect attention from that fight as President Asif Ali Zardari and his archrival, former Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif, fight it out and as street protests persist, politicians and analysts said.         
	It could also result in shifting political alliances, including new opportunities for the religious right that would be inimical to Washingtons interests, and even serve to make the Pakistani military restive for power again if the situation continued to worsen, they said.        
	The crisis was set off by a supreme court ruling on Wednesday that bars Sharif, and his brother, Shahbaz, from elected office. The decision was widely interpreted in Pakistan as a raw political manoeuvre engineered by Zardari to diminish the power of the two popular Opposition figures.         
	Prime Minister Yousuf Raza Gilani described the ruling as damaging to democracy. A daily newspaper published by a major Zardari supporter said the resulting political battle could be so debilitating that nuclear-armed Pakistan could end up in the ranks of failed nations alongside Somalia and Zimbabwe.        
	The two parties are going for the kill, said The Daily Times. As in the past they might both come a cropper, it added, suggesting that each would lose out if the military stepped in again.         
	Spokesmen for Zardari denied the ruling had been politically driven, and said that Zardari deplored the Sharifs disqualification from public office. But they said Sharifs intemperate statements after the ruling and the street protests made it imperative for the President to impose executive rule in Punjab, Pakistans most populous and most important province, where Shahbaz Sharif served as chief minister.        
	After the demonstrations it became obvious the province could not be run in accordance with the Constitution, said Farhatullah Babar, the presidential spokesman.         
	For Pakistan, where the military has ruled for more than half of the 61 years since independence and civilian governments have rarely completed a full term, combat between senior politicians is quite familiar.         
	In the 1990s, Sharif and Benazir Bhutto, the wife of Zardari who was assassinated in December 2007, dislodged each other as Prime Minister.        
	But in the 1990s, Pakistan was under a broad swath of American sanctions. This time, American interests are more intensely intertwined with the outcome of domestic politics.        
	The Obama administration, which this week hosted the Pakistani foreign minister, Shah Mehmood Qureshi, and the military chief, Gen. Ashfaq Parvez Kayani, in Washington, has had little to say about the unfolding political drama.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Senate turns away Illinois nominee 
                                                                                                               Senate turns away Illinois nominee 
                            
	Washington, Jan. 6 (AP): The man appointed by Illinois embattled governor to take over Barack Obamas vacant Senate seat was turned away when he appeared at the US Capitol to take his seat today.        
	Roland Burris announced the decision to deny him the seat as he stood before a large throng of reporters and cameras in the rain outside the Capitol building.        
	Burris, 71, declared that he had been informed that my credentials are not in order and will not be accepted. He said he was not seeking to have any type of confrontation over taking the seat that he was appointed to by Governor Rod Blagojevich.        
	 Speaking just an hour before the convening of the 111th Congress today, Burris said he was looking at a host of options for getting the seat. Senate Democrats had said they would block Burris.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | In silt, Bangladesh sees a sea shield

	Beel Bhaina (Bangladesh), March 21: The rivers that course down from the Himalayas and into this crowded delta bring an annual tide of gift and curse.         
	They flood low-lying paddies for several months, sometimes years, at a time. And they ferry mountains of silt and sand from far away upstream.         
	Most of that sediment washes out into the roiling Bay of Bengal. But an accidental discovery by desperate delta folk here may hold clues to how Bangladesh, one of the worlds most vulnerable countries to climate change, could harness some of that dark, rich Himalayan muck to protect itself against sea level rise.        
	Instead of allowing the silt to settle where it wants, Bangladesh has begun to channel it to where it is needed  to fill in shallow soup bowls of land prone to flooding, or to create new land off its long, exposed coast.         
	The efforts have been limited to small experimental patches, not uniformly promising, and there is still ample concern that a swelling sea could one day soon swallow parts of Bangladesh. But the emerging evidence suggests that a nation that many see as indefensible to the ravages of human-induced climate change could literally raise itself up and save its people  and do so cheaply and simply, using what the mountains and tides bring.        
	You can do a lot with the silt that these rivers bring, said Bea M. ten Tusscher, the Dutch ambassador to Bangladesh. The Netherlands, itself accustomed to engineering its vulnerable low-lands, helps Bangladesh with water management projects. Those are like little diamonds, ten Tusscher said.         
	Sceptics say it is folly to expect silt accretion to save the country. Accretion happens slowly, over centuries, they argue, while human-induced climate change is hurtling fast towards Bangladesh. The new land is too muddy and slushy for people to safely live on, and the force of the Himalayan rivers is so powerful that it can wash away newly gained land in one fluke season. If you have time to wait, it will happen, said Atiq Rahman of the Bangladesh Centre for Advanced Studies. His country, he added, does not have time to wait.         
	The silt-trapping experiment has yielded tentative but visible gains here in Beel Bhaina, a low-lying 600-acre soup bowl of land on the banks of the Hari river, a tributary of the Ganges, about 55 miles upstream from the Bay of Bengal. Even at this distance from the coast, it is among the countrys most susceptible to sea rise. The river swells each day with the tides. Creeping salinity in the water table is a harbinger of future danger.        
	Here, misery made way for a discovery. A devastating flood 10 years ago left this soup bowl  a beel in Bengali  inundated with water that reached above Abdul Lateefs head. No paddy could grow, recalled Lateef, now 56. Houses went under. The river was so heavily silted it hardly moved. Many families were reduced to penury.        
	One night, desperate to drain the water, Lateef and his neighbours punched a hole through the mud embankment that encircled the soup bowl. They watched as the water rushed out. Then the high tide began to haul in sediment, and the soup bowl swiftly filled with silt.        
	When the chief engineer of the local water board, Sheikh Nurul Ala, came to measure it, he saw that in four years, Beel Bhaina had risen by as much as three feet or more near the river bank, and almost as much farther inland. Today, it is a quilt of green and grey square patches of paddy, cut by square ponds to cultivate fish and shrimp.

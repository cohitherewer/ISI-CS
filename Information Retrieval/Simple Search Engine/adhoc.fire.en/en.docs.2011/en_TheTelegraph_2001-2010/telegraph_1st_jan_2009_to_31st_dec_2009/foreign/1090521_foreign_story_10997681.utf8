	Hong Kong, May 20: An Indonesian military cargo plane crashed into a village in East Java today, killing at least 99 people, according to military officials.         
	Television images from the scene showed the aircraft consumed in smoke and flames even as rescue workers tried to reach others still inside. Military spokesman Sagom Tamboen said the passengers included children.        
	Bambang Soelistyo, an air force spokesman, told news agencies that 11 crew members and 99 passengers had been on board, including air force personnel and civilian family members.         
	At a news conference, Tamboen said that the plane, a Hercules C-130, had been in good condition  despite being nearly 30 years old  and that the weather was clear before the crash, around dawn. It was not clear what caused the crash.        
	Images from Metro TV showed a gruesome scene, with soldiers using stretchers to carry bodies away from the burning wreckage. At least three people on the ground were reported killed.        
	An air force official told news agencies that the plane had crashed while on a training mission from Jakarta to the eastern province of Papua. He said the plane plowed into a neighbourhood in the village of Geplak, near the Iswahyudi air base in Madiun, about 523km east of Jakarta. Several witnesses said the plane split apart in the air following a loud explosion.        
	One of the wings fell off, Agus Yulianto, a villager, was quoted as saying on the website of the newspaper Kompas. Then the plane nose-dived into the houses. Two weeks ago, an ageing turbo-prop military plane slammed into a hangar in the city of Bandung, killing 24 people, including 17 special forces soldiers.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Pitt ties Jolie marriage to gay rights
                                                                                                               Pitt ties Jolie marriage to gay rights
                              Soulmate found                            
	Los Angeles, Aug. 6 (PTI): Hollywood superstar Brad Pitt has said that he has found his soulmate in partner Angelina Jolie but will not marry her until gay marriages are legalised.         
	I have love in my life, a soul mate  absolutely. When someone asked me why Angie and I dont get married, I replied: Maybe well get married when its legal for everyone else. I stand by that, although I took a lot of flak for saying it hate mail from religious groups, he said.         
	I believe everyone should have the same rights. They say gay marriage ruins families and hurts kids. Well, Ive had the privilege of seeing my gay friends being parents and watching their kids grow up in a loving environment, Pitt said in an interview to Parade magazine (www.parade.com).         
	Pitt also expressed his resentment over people, especially in the media, telling them how to lead their lives.

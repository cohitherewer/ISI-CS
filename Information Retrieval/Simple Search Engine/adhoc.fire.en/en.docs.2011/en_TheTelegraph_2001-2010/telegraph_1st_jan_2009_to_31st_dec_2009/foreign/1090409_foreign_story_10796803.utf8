The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Pak managed ISI envoy snub
                                                                                                               Pak managed ISI envoy snub
                            
	Washington, April 8 (Agencies): An American think tank has claimed that the ISI had stagemanaged an unprecedented snub to a delegation from the Obama administration by refusing to grant an exclusive meeting.        
	ISI chief Lt Gen Ahmed Shuja Pasha refused to meet the US special envoy, Richard Holbrooke, and the chairman of joint chiefs of staff, Admiral Mike Mullen, yesterday, according to the US-based Stratfor.        
	 An ISI spokesperson in Islamabad denied the report, saying Pasha was present at a meeting in which other Pakistani officials also took part. Stratfor, however, said it had learnt that the top US military commander and Washingtons pointman on Afghanistan and Pakistan had requested a separate meeting with the ISI chief, which was not granted.        
	The rebuff was a means of telegraphing its resentment over a number of issues brewing between Washington and Islamabad, Stratfor said.        
	The attitude will complicate the Obama administrations strategy on the Taliban, the think tank added.        
	Among the issues of resentment by ISI include criticism from Mullen and the US Central Command chief, Gen David Petraeus, who said the intelligence agency was still dealing with the Taliban and al Qaida. The ISI also resents the Obama administrations efforts to involve India in Afghanistan, the agency said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Meltdown dissolves Iceland coalition
                                                                                                               Meltdown dissolves Iceland coalition
                              Haarde: Hard hit                            
	London, Jan. 27: Icelands coalition government collapsed yesterday, the first government to fall as a direct result of the global economic turmoil        
	Prime Minister Geir Haarde resigned yesterday after his Independence Partys coalition with the Social Democratic Alliance (SDA) collapsed under pressure from mounting public anger.        
	As personal savings have been wiped out and joblessness has soared, Icelanders  once among the worlds wealthiest people  have taken to the streets in protest, banging pots and pans and throwing eggs and toilet paper at Haarde and other parliamentary leaders.        
	Perhaps nowhere has the economic crash been more spectacular than Iceland.         
	Last year, its largest banks went bust and the value of its currency plummeted. In recent days, protests intensified as no leader took responsibility for the crash, prompting police to use tear gas for the first time in half a century.        
	People felt that the government was playing the violin while the Titanic was sinking, best-selling Icelandic author Andri Snr Magnason said in a telephone interview from Reykjavik, the capital.         
	President Olafur Ragnar Grimsson has called on the social democrats, junior partner in the outgoing coalition, to form a new government with Opposition parties.        
	Grimsson told reporters he had asked Ingibjorg Gisladottir, foreign minister under Haarde and head of the SDA, to take the lead on forming a government.

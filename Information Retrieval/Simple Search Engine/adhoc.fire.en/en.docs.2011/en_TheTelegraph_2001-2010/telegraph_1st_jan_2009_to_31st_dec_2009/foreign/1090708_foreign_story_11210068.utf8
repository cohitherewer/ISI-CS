	Los Angeles, July 7 (AP): Michael Jacksons public memorial started out more spiritual than spectacular today.        
	It opened with a church choir singing as his golden casket was laid in front of the stage and a shaft of light evoking a cross as Lionel Richie gave a gospel-infused performance.        
	 Pastor Lucious W. Smith of the Friendship Baptist Church in Pasadena gave the invocation, followed by Mariah Carey singing the opening performance with a rendition of the Jackson 5 ballad Ill Be There, a duet with Trey Lorenz. We come together and we remember the time, said Smith, riffing off one of Jacksons lyrics. As long as we remember him, he will always be there to comfort us.

	The service began with Smokey Robinson reading comments from Nelson Mandela, Diana Ross and other friends of the King of Pop. Following a long silent period inside the venue, piano music and a gospel choir kicked things off with a stained-glass motif in the background.        
	An estimated 20,000 people were in the Staples Center as Jacksons golden, flower-draped casket was brought to the venue in a motorcade under law enforcement escort.        
	Fans with a ticket wore gold wristbands and picked up a metallic gold programme guide on their way in. The pallbearers who placed Jacksons casket into the hearse each wore a gold necktie, a single spangly white glove and sunglasses.        
	Jacksons hearse had been part of a motorcade that smoothly whisked his body 10 miles across closed freeways from a private service at a Hollywood Hills cemetery to his public memorial and awaiting fans.        
	 Some arriving celebrities strolled down a black carpet on their way in. Spike Lee, Wesley Snipes and Barbara Walters were among the celebrities seen at the entrance. The traffic snarls and logistical nightmares that had been feared by police and city officials had not materialised.         
	Earlier in the morning, Jacksons family members and dozens of friends, led by his parents, Joe and Katherine, were seen entering a building at the cemetery. News reports estimated as many as 20 helicopters circled overhead.        
	The public memorial was televised live around the world and streamed over the Internet. Among the celebrities who spoke or performed at the memorial were were Stevie Wonder, Usher, Kobe Bryant, Jennifer Hudson, John Mayer and Martin Luther King III, son of the slain civil rights leader.        
	Outside the Staples Center, Claudia Hernandez, 29, said she loved Jacksons music as a girl growing up in Mexico. Now a day-care teaching assistant in Los Angeles, Hernandez said she cried watching TV coverage of his death. Im trying to hold in my emotions, said Hernandez. I know right now hes teaching the angels to dance.

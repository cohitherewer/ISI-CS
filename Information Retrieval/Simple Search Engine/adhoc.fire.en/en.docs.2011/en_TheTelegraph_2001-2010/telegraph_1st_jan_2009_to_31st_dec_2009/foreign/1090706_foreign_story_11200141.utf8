                                                                                                               Hindi flak for Nepal minister
                            
	Kathmandu, July 5 PTI): A Nepalese minister who chose to speak in Hindi at a programme here faced opposition from the audience.        
	Education minister Ramchandra Prasad Kushwaha, also a leader of the Terai Madhes Democratic Party, spoke in Hindi at a programme to mark the signing of an agreement between a Nepalese college and CG Manipal, an Indo-Nepalese educational joint venture.        
	The audience objected as soon as Kushwaha, who hails from the Terai region, started speaking, prompting the minister to defend himself. Kushwaha said he had every right to speak Hindi, which is widely spoken in the Terai.        
	You people didnt object when the previous speakers spoke in English, but why do you bother when I speak in Hindi? the minister shot back. Indian ambassador to Nepal Rakesh Sood was present at the programme.        
	Last year, Vice-President Paramananda Jha had taken the oath of office in Hindi, sparking widespread protests for several days.

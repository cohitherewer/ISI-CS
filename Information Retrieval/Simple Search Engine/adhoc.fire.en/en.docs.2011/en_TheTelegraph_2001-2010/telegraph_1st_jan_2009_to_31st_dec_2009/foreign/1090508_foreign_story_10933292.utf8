	Washington, May 7: Confronting a deteriorating situation in Afghanistan and Pakistan, President Obama said yesterday that the US was deeply committed to helping the two countries defeat al Qaida and its extremist partners, and in helping democracy endure and flourish.        
	No matter what happens, we will not be deterred, Obama said during an appearance in the White House grand foyer after meeting with President Asif Ali Zardari of Pakistan and President Hamid Karzai of Afghanistan. Every day we see evidence of the future that al Qaida and its allies offer. Its a future filled with violence and despair.        
	The tripartite meeting with Zardari and Karzai was intended by the White House, in part, to press both men to do more to crack down on the rising threat from the Taliban and al Qaida in both countries. We meet today as three sovereign nations joined by a common goal: to disrupt, dismantle and defeat al Qaida, Obama said.

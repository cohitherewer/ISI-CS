The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Qaida wing says it gave Nigerian bomb
                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      Qaida wing says it gave Nigerian bomb

	Kailua (Hawaii), Dec. 29 (Reuters): A wing of al Qaida claimed responsibility today for a failed Christmas Day attack on a US-bound passenger plane, and President Barack Obama vowed to bring every element of US power against those who threaten Americans safety.        
	In a statement posted on Islamist websites, the group al Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula said the attempt was to avenge US attacks on its members in Yemen.        
	The group said it had provided the Nigerian suspect in the failed airliner bombing with a technically advanced device but that it did not detonate because of a technical fault.        
	Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab, 23, is charged with smuggling explosives on board and attempting to blow up a Northwest Airlines flight as it approached Detroit from Amsterdam on December 25 with almost 300 people on board.        
	Speaking during a vacation in Hawaii, Obama said: We will not rest until we find all who were involved and hold them accountable. We will continue to use every element of our national power to disrupt, to dismantle and defeat the violent extremists who threaten us, whether they are from Afghanistan or Pakistan, Yemen or Somalia, or anywhere where they are plotting attacks against the US homeland, Obama added.        
	Abdulmutallab, who had a valid US visa issued before he was placed on a broad US list of possible security threats, has told investigators that al Qaida operatives in Yemen gave him an explosive device and taught him how to detonate it, officials said over the weekend.        
	ABC News broadcast what it described as US government photos of the bomb Abdulmutallab is accused of smuggling aboard the flight in his underwear.         
	The images showed the slightly burned underwear with a packet of the high-explosive chemical PETN sewn into the crotch and a plastic syringe detonator, ABC said.        
	The incident has put a spotlight on the growing prominence of al Qaida in Yemen, which the US and Saudi Arabia fear will exploit instability in Yemen to stage attacks in the Saudi kingdom.        
	In a worrying development for US security, officials have discovered that Abdulmutallabs father warned them of his sons growing radicalism, but the information failed to prevent his travelling to the US on a two-year visa issued June 16, 2008.        
	Obama said that as a result of this oversight, he had ordered a thorough review of the screening process.        
	We need to determine just how the suspect was able to bring dangerous explosives aboard an aircraft and what additional steps we can take to thwart future attacks, Obama said.        
	Obama is under pressure from Opposition Republicans who have been critical of his response to the Christmas Day scare and have questioned whether his administration is doing enough to contain security threats. His administration admitted yesterday that the incident represented a failure of air security.

	London, June 14: Owners who think that their dog has a guilty look are fooling themselves, according to a new study.         
	The penitent expressions some believe that they can spot on their pets faces after they banish them to the doghouse is also a figment of their imagination, researchers have found.         
	In one experiment, they told pet owners their dogs were guilty of misbehaving by stealing treats they had been specifically told they could not have.         
	Even though the animals were innocent owners still felt they could see a look of guilt.         
	The researchers insist there is no basis in owners belief that they can read their pets body language.         
	They are merely projecting human values onto their animals, they said.        
	Some dogs looked guilty after they had been told off by their owners, the findings, published in the journal Behavioural Processes, also show.         
	Alexandra Horowitz, an assistant professor at Barnard College in New York, who carried out the research, said: Given that discovery of, say, a stolen roast or garbage on the floor is often followed instantly by cries of alarm and scolding, it is not surprising that, in retrospect, owners would conflate the sources of dogs resulting guilty looks.         
	Merely uttering a dogs name with a rising, accusatory tone is often enough to elicit pre-emptive submissive behaviour.        
	The results indicate that the so-called guilty look is a response to owner scolding; it is not expressed more often when actually guilty.

	Berlin, Aug. 24: Nokia, the worlds largest maker of mobile phones, said today that it would make and sell its own netbook computers, expanding into the fastest-growing segment of the PC market.        
	The company, which is struggling to keep up with the iPhone from Apple and the BlackBerry from Research In Motion in the smartphone market, has not made a computer since the 1980s.        
	Like smartphones, netbooks are increasingly being used to access the Internet from outside the home. In the only details it has revealed, the company said that the Nokia Booklet 3G would run Microsoft Windows software and use an Intel Atom processor.

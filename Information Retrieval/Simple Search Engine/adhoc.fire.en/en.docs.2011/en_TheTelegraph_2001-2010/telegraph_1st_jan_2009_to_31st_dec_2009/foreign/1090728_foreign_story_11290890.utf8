The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Terror ties run deep in Pak after 26/11
                                                                                                               Terror ties run deep in Pak after 26/11
          JANE PERLEZ AND SALMAN MASOOD                        Kasab: Serious challenge				                                 
	Rawalpindi, July 27: In a high-security jail here, five men  all members of the Lashkar-e-Toiba, described by the US and India as the organiser of the terrorist rampage in Mumbai last year  were brought before a makeshift court in Pakistans first steps to bring them to justice.        
	The brief appearances, described by a defence lawyer, were held in secret for security reasons on Saturday in a case that Pakistan says shows its willingness to prosecute the militant group.         
	Pakistan also says the case will demonstrate that its military, which once backed the group as a surrogate force against India, has severed all ties. But behind the first glimmerings of the case, sympathies for the Lashkar and its jihadists run deep in this country, raising a serious challenge to any long-lasting moves to dismantle the network.        
	The membership of the Lashkar extends to about 150,000 people, according to a mid-level officer in the Inter-Services Intelligence. Together with another jihadi group, Jaish-e-Mohammed, the Lashkar loyalists could put Pakistan up in flames, the officer admitted.         
	Despite that risk, the jihadis were good people and could be controlled, the officer said, speaking on the condition of anonymity in keeping with the agencys custom.         
	Barack Obama administration officials say they continue to press the Pakistanis to guarantee prevention of a sequel to the 26/11 attacks.         
	A surprise confession last week of the sole surviving attacker made clear that the Lashkar has the capacity to quickly and inexpensively train young men from villages into intensely driven, proficient killers, a senior Obama administration official said.         
	The attacker, Ajmal Kasab, 21, has described receiving training in camps in Muzaffarabad and in Manshera, a northwest town. His account has been largely discounted in Pakistan as being forced by Indian investigators, but many details conform to descriptions of Lashkar operations offered by 2 former members.         
	The members, who said they had friendly relations with the outfit, said that at least one Lashkar training camp was still operating in the hills around Muzaffarabad.         
	Pakistan said it had severed ties with the Lashkar in the wake of the September 11 attacks, under pressure from the George Bush administration to join its campaign against terrorism. The interior minister, Rehman Malik, said the groups infrastructure was no more intact.         
	But Obama administration officials say they are still trying to understand the state of relations between Pakistan and the group. Among the most likely versions, they say, none would tamp down hostilities between Pakistan and India.

	Kathmandu, Nov. 2 (Reuters): Nepals cabinet plans to meet at the base camp of Mount Everest this month to highlight the impact of global warming on the Himalayas ahead of next months UN negotiations on climate change, a minister said today.        
	The base camp is located at about 5,300 metres and is the point from where climbers to the Everest summit begin their ascent.         
	The cabinet meeting is meant to draw the attention to the adverse impact of climate change to the Himalayas including Sagarmatha, forest minister Deepak Bohara said, using the Nepali name of the mountain.        
	The Maldives held the worlds first underwater cabinet meeting last month, in a symbolic cry for help over rising sea levels that threaten the Indian Ocean archipelagos existence.        
	Bohara said Nepal would also send some of its renowned Everest climbers to Copenhagen next month to highlight the problems of glacier melting, erratic rains and unprecedented forest fires.        
	Negotiations for a new global accord to fight global warming are scheduled to conclude at the UN Climate Change Conference in the Danish capital in December.        
	Bohara also appealed to Everest climbers from around the world to gather in their climbing gear in Copenhagen.

	Colombo, March 10 (Reuters): A suspected Tamil Tiger suicide bomber killed 15 people and wounded 35, including Sri Lankas telecommunications minister, during a Muslim festival in the islands south today, officials said.        
	It took place in front of a mosque in Godapitiya in Matara district, about 160km south of the capital, Colombo, during the Id-e-Milad-un-Nabi festival. Six ministers were there and terrorists used this opportunity to target us. Only one minister, Mahinda Wijesekara, got injured, oil resources minister A.H.M. Fowzie said from the scene.        
	Wijesekara is minister for post and telecommunications.        
	Around 35 injured had been admitted to hospital and among them four are seriously wounded, Matara hospitals director, Aruna Jayasekara, said. Wijesekara was in the intensive care unit and later was flown to Colombo.        
	The government called the attack another desperate act by the LTTE. The attack reaffirms the fact that the LTTE is not only a ruthless terrorist outfit but also one which has no regard or respect for religion. This is an attack that deliberately targeted the Muslim community, it said. The LTTE has attacked Muslims in the past, and in 1990 slaughtered more than 140 at mosques in eastern Sri Lanka during Friday prayers. The LTTE could not be reached for comment today.         
	There were pieces of legs and hands inside the mosques grounds. Around 15 bodies were there at the spot. There was blood all over the place, said M.A.M. Mashahir, a school principal chaperoning 30 students to the celebration. The Sri Lankan military has cornered the LTTE in about 45sqkm of the northeastern coast and is confident of defeating them as a conventional force soon.         
	But the Tigers have always had the capacity to strike far from the war zone using unconventional tactics, and analysts say they expect that to continue in the near future. The Tigers are on US, EU, Canadian and Indian terrorist lists for their widespread use of suicide bombs during a separatist conflict that has raged off and on since 1983. The only thing slowing the current military offensive against the Tigers is the presence of civilians trapped by the rebels in a coastal zone.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Court blocks BA strike
                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      Court blocks BA strike
                            
	London, Dec. 17 (Reuters): British Airways Plc won a court ruling today to prevent a 12-day cabin crew strike that threatened to leave hundreds of thousands of passengers stranded over Christmas.        
	BA cabin crew had said they would walk out from December 22, escalating a dispute over job losses and changes to working practices. About 13,000 BA staff were balloted by the Unite union, 92.5 per cent of whom backed the strike.        
	However, the High Court in London upheld BAs complaint that Unite had breached industrial relations law by balloting around 1,000 staff who had left the company or were in the process of leaving.

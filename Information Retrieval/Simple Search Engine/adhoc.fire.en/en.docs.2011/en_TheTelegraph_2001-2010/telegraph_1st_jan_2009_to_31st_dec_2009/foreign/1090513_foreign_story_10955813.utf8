The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | General ouster tied to shift in Afghan war
                                                                                                               General ouster tied to shift in Afghan war
          ELISABETH BUMILLER AND THOM SHANKER                              (Top) General McKiernan, General McChrystal				                                 
	Washington, May 12: The top American commander in Afghanistan, General David D. McKiernan, was forced out yesterday in an abrupt shake-up intended to bring a more aggressive and innovative approach to a worsening seven-year war.         
	Defence secretary Robert M. Gates announced the decision in terse comments at the Pentagon, saying that fresh eyes were needed and that a new approach was probably in our best interest. When asked if the dismissal ended the generals military career, Gates replied: Probably.         
	The move reflects a belief that the war in Afghanistan, waged against an increasingly strong Taliban and its supporters across a rugged, sprawling country, is growing ever more complex. Defence department officials said General McKiernan, a respected career armour officer, had been removed primarily because he had brought too conventional an approach to the challenge.        
	He is to be replaced by Lieutenant General Stanley A. McChrystal, a former commander of the Joint Special Operations Command. He served in Afghanistan as chief of staff of military operations in 2001 and 2002 and ran all commando operations in Iraq.         
	Forces under General McChrystals command were credited with finding and capturing Saddam Hussein and with tracking and killing Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, the leader of the al Qaida in Mesopotamia. His success in using intelligence and firepower to track and kill insurgents, and his training in unconventional warfare that emphasises the need to protect the population, made him the best choice for the command in Afghanistan, defence department officials said.         
	At the same time, he will be confronted with deep tensions over the conduct of Special Operations forces in Afghanistan, whose aggressive tactics are seen by Afghan officials as responsible for many of the American mistakes that have resulted in the deaths of civilians.        
	Pentagon officials have begun to describe Afghanistan as the militarys top priority, even more important than the war in Iraq. President Obama announced a major overhaul of American strategy in Afghanistan in March. Planned troop levels are expected to reach more than 60,000 Americans.        
	Pentagon officials said it appeared that General McKiernan was the first general to be dismissed from command of a theatre of combat since Douglas MacArthur during the Korean War.        
	At a Pentagon news conference yesterday, Gates praised General McKiernan for what he called his long and distinguished service, but said of Afghanistan: Our mission there requires new thinking and new approaches by our military leaders. General McKiernan served in his current command for only 11 months.         
	Admiral Mike Mullen, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, joined Gates in making the announcement. The change also reflects the influence of General Petraeus, who took over last autumn as the top American commander for Iraq and Afghanistan.

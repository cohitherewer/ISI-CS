	Phoenix to rap    
	 Los Angeles, Feb. 4 (AP): Actor Joaquin Phoenix says there is no hoax about it: He really has given up acting to become a hip-hop musician.      
	Phoenix has been spending his time laying down tracks for a rap album in the recording studio he built at his home, the two-time Academy Award nominee said yesterday in an interview to promote what he claims is his final movie, Two Lovers.      
	After video hit the Internet last month capturing part of Phoenixs debut rap performance at a Las Vegas club, speculation swirled that he was perpetrating an elaborate practical joke.      
	I dont know where that comes from, Phoenix said.

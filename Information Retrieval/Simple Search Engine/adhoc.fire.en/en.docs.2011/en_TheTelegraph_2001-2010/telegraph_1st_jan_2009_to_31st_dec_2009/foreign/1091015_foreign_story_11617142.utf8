	Hong Kong, Oct. 14: One of Hong Kongs largest developers announced today that it had sold an apartment for 439 million Hong Kong dollars.         
	Just hours later, the citys chief executive warned that the city might be facing a real estate bubble.        
	The deal, valued at the equivalent of $56.6 million (Rs 260.63 crore), set a record price per square foot for Hong Kong. The developer, Henderson Land, said it was not aware of a higher figure been paid anywhere else.         
	Henderson Land declined to disclose the buyers name but said it was a company registered in Hong Kong. The buyers representative spoke the local dialect with a mainland Chinese accent and appeared to be spending money earned on the mainland.        
	As Chinas economic recovery has gathered force this autumn, wealthy Chinese are pouring fortunes into Hong Kong real estate, producing a powerful surge in prices for luxury real estate. Hong Kong pegs its currency to the US dollar and links its interest rates to American rates; with a flood of money pouring into local banks. Adjustable-rate mortgages are available in Hong Kong for an initial rate as low as 2.05 per cent.        
	Donald Tsang, the citys chief executive, cautioned in his annual policy address today that the boom might not last. The relatively small number of residential units completed and the record prices attained in certain transactions this year have caused concern about the supply of flats, difficulty in purchasing a home and the possibility of a property bubble, Tsang said.        
	Henderson Land said that the apartment on the island, near the top of a skyscraper overlooking Victoria Harbour, was a two-storey unit with five bedroom suites. It measures 572 square metres and has a garden of 340 square feet. The price per square foot was 71,289 Hong Kong dollars.

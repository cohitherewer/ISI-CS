                                                                                                               Rajapaksa visits seized Tiger hub
                            
	Colombo, April 16 (PTI): Sri Lankan President Mahinda Rajapaksa today paid a surprise visit to the LTTEs captured political headquarters of Kilinochchi, the first trip by a head of the state to the embattled north of the island nation in nearly three decades.        
	During his visit, Rajapaksa, also the Commander-in-Chief of the Sri Lankan armed forces, attended a ceremony organised by the army, which handed over a report to the President on the war situation.        
	The President made this goodwill visit during the traditional Sinhala and Hindu New Year period to meet with the troops stationed there as well as IDPs (Internally Displaced Persons) and other civilians, an official statement said.        
	Kilinochchi, 350 km north of Colombo, was brought under the control of the Sri Lankan army on January 2 after fierce clashes with the Tamil Tigers, ending the LTTEs domination of the region.

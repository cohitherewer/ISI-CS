                                                                                                               Pakistan army Swats Taliban
                            
	Islamabad, May 24 (AP): Pakistani troops battling the Taliban have captured several points in the Swat Valleys main town, the army said today, including a spot nicknamed bloody intersection because militants routinely dumped the mutilated bodies of their victims there.        
	Elsewhere in the northwest, helicopter gunships pounded alleged militant hide-outs in a tribal region, killing at least 18 people, while police said they had captured an important militant commander and six other Taliban fighters.        
	A military statement today said forces moving from street to street secured eight crossings while encountering at least 12 roadside bombs. One secured spot was Green Chowk, which earned the bloody intersection tag because of the terrifying spectacle of the Taliban victims.        
	Five suspected militants were killed in various parts of Mingora while 14 others were arrested, the army said. Overall in the valley, 10 militants were killed in the past 24 hours, it said.        
	The army has said 10,000 to 20,000 residents are still stranded in the town, which normally has a population of at least 375,000.        
	One trapped civilian told The Associated Press via phone yesterday night gunshots were ringing through the air, first continuously then at intervals. He said he had tried to flee the city twice but failed due to the fighting and lack of transportation.        
	I will try to leave again whenever I get another chance, said Fazal Wadood, a local leader of the Opposition Pakistan Muslim League (Nawaz) party. It is like inviting death to stay here anymore.        
	The army also said its forces had entered Piochar village, a hub in a remote part of Swat that is considered the rear base for Swat Taliban leader Maulana Fazlullah. A large cache of arms was recovered from suspected militant hide-outs and a bomb-making factory was unearthed, the military statement said.        
	Today morning in Orakzai, a tribal region bordering Afghanistan, helicopter gunships pounded suspected militant targets in multiple locations, including a madarsa, local government official Mohammad Yasin said.        
	At least six civilians were among the 18 dead, he said, adding that the targeted spots were strongholds of Hakeemullah Mehsud, a deputy to Pakistani Taliban chief Baitullah Mehsud. Hundreds fled the area amid the fighting, he said.        
	The police in nearby Charsadda district said they caught seven Taliban militants during a raid on a madarsa today. They included Qari Ihsanullah, a Taliban commander suspected in attacks in Pakistan and Afghanistan, Charsadda police chief Riaz Khan said.

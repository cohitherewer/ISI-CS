	Libido drink    
	 London, July 26: A glass or two of red wine may increase a womans libido, a scientific study has found.       
	Researchers concluded that levels of sexual desire were higher in women who were moderate drinkers of red wine than in their counterparts who preferred other alcoholic drinks, or were teetotal, reports The Sunday Telegraph.       
	One theory put forward by the team of Italian doctors at the University of Florence, who carried out the study, is that chemical compounds found in red wine may improve sexual functioning by increasing blood flow to key areas of the body.    
	Janitor Pitt     
	 London (PTI): Brad Pitt has compared fatherhood to being a janitor. The actor, who has six children with partner Angelina Jolie, said taking care of the unruly, untidy group had taught him a lot, reported the Daily Mail. Theres a lot of janitorial work involved in being a father, and I must say Im pretty good at it. If I leave something out in the open, then sooner or later theres going to be some sort of stain on it. Its not the kids fault, its mine for leaving it there, Pitt said. The actor, who claims to be good at changing nappies, said: The secret to changing a nappy is youve got to do it quick. Im pretty quick, if I do say so myself.

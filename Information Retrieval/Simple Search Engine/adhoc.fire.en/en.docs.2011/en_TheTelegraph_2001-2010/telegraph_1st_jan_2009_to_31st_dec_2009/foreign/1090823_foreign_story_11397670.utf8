The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Tory leader in trouble over attractive MP slur
                                                                                                               Tory leader in trouble over attractive MP slur

The Italian leader had stirred a controversy by proposing that a string of attractive female candidates contest the polls. (AFP)                                  
	London, Aug. 22: A Conservative constituency party chairman has said that he would only select a woman as an MP if they were attractive.        
	Alan Scard, the chairman of Gosport Conservative Association in Hampshire, is selecting a candidate to replace Sir Peter Viggers as the local MP at the next election. Sir Peter announced that he would quit parliament after The Daily Telegraph disclosed he had attempted to claim 1,645 in parliamentary expenses for a floating duck house.         
	Asked whether he was happy to support efforts by David Cameron, the Conservative leader, to put more women in parliament, Scard said: If they are attractive, yeah I would go for it.        
	I know its a sexist thing to say, Scard told Channel 4 News, but you could get the blokes saying: Oh you know, I would vote for her because shes really attractive.        
	However, on reflection, he added: But then the other women say: Oh I dont like her, shes too attractive.        
	The comments are likely to cause embarrassment for Cameron. They led to further claims that large sections of his party continue to have outdated, politically incorrect views and do not share his liberal Conservativism.        
	They came days after Daniel Hannan and Roger Helmer, both Conservative MEPs, attracted controversy by respectively attacking the NHS and denying that homophobia existed.        
	Tessa Jowell, the cabinet office minister, said: These comments, which are deeply offensive and hugely patronising to women, are exactly the type of Tory attitude David Cameron claims to have got rid of. In the last two weeks we have seen Tories denying homophobia exists, condemning the NHS and now this blatant sexism.

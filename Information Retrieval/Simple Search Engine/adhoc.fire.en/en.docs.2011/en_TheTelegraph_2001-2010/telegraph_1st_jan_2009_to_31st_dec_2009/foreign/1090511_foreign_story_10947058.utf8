	Prison hotel    
	 London, May 10: A prison in Surrey will launch a restaurant today where inmates will prepare and serve the food, reports The Sunday Telegraph.       
	The Clink, at High Down prison, will have a pan-European menu and contemporary design. But this is a restaurant where there is razor wire on the roof and the cutlery is made of plastic. Inmates are trained to prepare and serve dishes as part of an innovative new project to rehabilitate offenders and help them get a job on release from jail.       
	Due to security concerns, members of the public will not be able to book a table in the usual manner but may eat there if they are invited as corporate guests or charity volunteers.     
	Sun suicide     
	 London (Reuters): Too much sunlight in places like Greenland where long summer days often cause insomnia appears more likely to drive a person to suicide, Swedish researchers said this week. Despite a belief that suicides tend to rise in late autumn and early winter months because of darkness, the new findings suggest that places where constant sunlight in summer seasons is a fact of life may be just as dangerous.

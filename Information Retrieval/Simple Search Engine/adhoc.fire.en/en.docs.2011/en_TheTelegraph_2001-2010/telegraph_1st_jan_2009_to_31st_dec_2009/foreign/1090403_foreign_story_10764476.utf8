	London, April 2: Using Twitter or Facebook at work can make you a better employee, according to a study which claims that surfing the Internet for fun during office hours increases productivity.         
	The study by the University of Melbourne showed that people who use the Internet for personal reasons at work are about 9 per cent more productive that those who do not. Study author Brent Coker, from the department of management and marketing, said workplace Internet leisure browsing or WILB, helped to sharpen workers concentration.         
	Short and unobtrusive breaks, such as a quick surf of the Internet, enables the mind to rest itself, leading to a higher total net concentration for a days work, and as a result, increased productivity, he said. According to the study of 300 workers, 70 per cent of people who use the Internet at work engage in WILB.         
	Among the most popular WILB activities are searching for information about products, reading online news sites, playing online games and watching videos on YouTube.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | US governor admits affair
                                                                                                               US governor admits affair
          ROBBIE BROWN AND SHAILA DEWAN                          Sanford in Columbia, South Carolina. (Reuters)                                   
	Columbia (South Carolina), June 25: Governor Mark Sanford of South Carolina said yesterday that he had been having an extramarital affair with a woman in Argentina for the last year, ending the mystery surrounding his disappearance over Fathers Day weekend.        
	But his confession and apology, in a rambling, nationally televised news conference, left other mysteries unsolved, like whether he had lied to his staff members as late as Monday about his whereabouts, whether the affair had definitively ended, whether he would resign from the governorship and whether he would even have acknowledged the affair had he not been met at the airport in Atlanta by a reporter upon his return.        
	Sanford, 49, admitted that he had been in Buenos Aires since Thursday, not hiking on the Appalachian Trail, as his staff members had said.        
	Standing in the rotunda of the South Carolina statehouse, the governor, a Republican who had been considered a possible presidential candidate in 2012, cried as he spoke, taking more than seven minutes to apologise before getting to the crux of the matter.        
	The bottom line is this, he said. I have been unfaithful to my wife. The governors wife, Jenny, 46, issued a statement later in the day saying that while she loves her husband, she asked him to leave the family two weeks ago in a trial separation.

          OUR BUREAU                          A soldier watches Obama at a US base in Kabul. (AP)                                  
	Dec. 2: Two Barack Obamas went before America on Tuesday night, the commander-in-chief assuming full ownership of the Afghanistan war he did not start and the chief executive, acknowledging domestic compulsions by mapping an exit plan.        
	A third but less forthcoming Obama referred to a threat his security team focuses on daily but speaks about rarely: the vulnerability of nuclear weapons in Pakistan.        
	If the contrasting messages seemed jarring at first, they reflected the obstacles Obama faces in rallying an increasingly polarised America.        
	Not to mention a more daunting challenge called Pakistan. The stakes are even higher within a nuclear-armed Pakistan, because we know that al Qaida and other extremists seek nuclear weapons, and we have every reason to believe that they would use them, Obama said.        
	Obamas decision to raise the nuclear spectre was notable because several American officials stated recently that the Pakistani arsenal is secure. In private, however, they commissioned new intelligence studies on how vulnerable Pakistani warheads and laboratories would be if insurgents made greater inroads.        
	This is the epicentre of the violent extremism practised by al Qaida, Obama said, speaking of both Afghanistan and Pakistan and their murky border.         
	The region was the birthplace of the September 11, 2001, attacks, he said, and it is from here that new attacks are being plotted as I speak.        
	But the President left much unsaid about Pakistan. Obama could not be specific about his Pakistan strategy, his advisers conceded. American operations there are classified, most run by the CIA.         
	Yet quietly, they said, Obama has authorised an expansion of the war in Pakistan  if only he can get a weak, divided, suspicious Pakistani government to agree to the terms.        
	In recent months, in addition to providing White House officials with classified assessments about Afghanistan, the CIA has delivered a plan for widening the campaign of strikes against militants by drone aircraft in Pakistan, sending additional spies there and securing a White House commitment to bulk up the CIAs budget for operations inside the country. The expanded operations could include drone strikes in the southern province of Baluchistan, where senior Afghan Taliban leaders are believed to be hiding, officials said.        
	But the Pakistanis have not yet agreed  a point cited today by sceptical Indian officials. How far can the US expand its operation in Pakistan? an Indian official asked.        
	Obama did not mention India. But hours after the speech, US ambassador Timothy J. Roemer said that India is a key global partner of Washington and underscored that the two countries share the core goal of disrupting terrorist networks in the region.

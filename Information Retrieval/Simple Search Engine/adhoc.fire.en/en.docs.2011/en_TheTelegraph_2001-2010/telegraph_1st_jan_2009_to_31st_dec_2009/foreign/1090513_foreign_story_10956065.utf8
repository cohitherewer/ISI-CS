	Los Angeles, May 12 (Reuters): Titanic stars Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet and the films director James Cameron have responded to a challenge and donated $30,000 to support the last survivor of the Titanic in her last years, a representative for DiCaprio said yesterday.        
	The survivor, 97-year-old Millvina Dean, has reportedly resorted to selling her autograph to pay her nursing home bills in Southampton, the English city from which Titanic began its fateful maiden voyage in 1912.        
	Dean was only 9 weeks old when her family travelled on Titanic in hopes of beginning a new life in the US. Her father was one of the 1,517 casualties after the supposedly unsinkable ship hit an iceberg in the Atlantic.        
	DiCaprio, Winslet and Cameron made their combined $30,000 donation after Irish author and photographer Don Mullan publicly challenged them to match his donation, said Ken Sunshine, a spokesman for DiCaprio. Mullan, who photographed Dean for an exhibition, made his appeal last month in the Irish Independent newspaper.        
	The 1997 drama Titanic made more than $1.8 billion at the worldwide box office, making it the highest-grossing film of all time in figures not adjusted for inflation. It went on to win 11 Oscars, including best picture.

	Islamabad, Nov. 8 (PTI): Police tonight shot dead a suspected suicide bomber when he tried to attack a security checkpost in Islamabad.        
	The bomber emerged from a pick-up truck and tried to blow up the post in Sector F-11 in the heart of the capital. However, alert policemen guarding the post shot him down, deputy inspector-general of police (operations) Bin Yamin said.         
	He came out of the pick-up truck, which had darkened windows, and shouted: Allah- u-Akbar and tried to attack the post. Our personnel opened fire and one of the bullets hit the bomber in the head. He was killed before he could detonate his explosives, Yamin told the Geo News channel. A bomb disposal squad defused the explosives inside the bombers suicide jacket, he added.         
	Yamin said it was not clear how many persons were in the truck which sped away after the firing. A high alert has been sounded in the city and we are searching for the truck, he said.        
	In Adazai, 16km south of Peshawar, a suicide bomber blew himself up in a crowded market, killing 12. A mayor, who once supported but had turned against the Taliban, was also killed.

	Worst day     
	 London, Aug. 23: Wednesday  not Monday  is the worst day of the week, according to research by two American applied mathematicians, reports The Sunday Telegraph.       
	Professors Christopher Danforth and Peter Dodds, of Vermont University, analysed words used in 2.4 million Internet blogs such as Twitter, giving a score out of nine depending on how positive they were.       
	Words like free, fun, rainbow and sex all scored eight and above, while words such as betray, cruel, hatred and suffocate all scored less than two.       
	Saturday and Sunday rated predictably well but, perhaps surprisingly, Monday came out as the second happiest day of the week, partly because people were still reminiscing about the weekend. However, by Wednesday, these feelings had subsided.     
	Prince date    
	 London: Quietly and without fanfare, Prince William has taken a summer holiday in Cornwall. While his girlfriend Kate Middleton wasnt in his party, Natasha Rufus Isaacs  an old chum of the second-in-line to the British throne  was often to be seen by his side. I dont want to talk about the holiday, Natasha, the 26-year-old daughter of the Marquess of Reading, said last week. It was a private occasion. Kate Middleton was, meanwhile, working at her parentss mail order business in Berkshire, reports The Sunday Telegraph.

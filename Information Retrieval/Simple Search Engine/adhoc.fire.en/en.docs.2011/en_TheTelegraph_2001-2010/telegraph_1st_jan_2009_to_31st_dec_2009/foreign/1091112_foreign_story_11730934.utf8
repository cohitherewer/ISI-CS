          KATE DEVLIN                          A patients blood is collected for a cholesterol test                                  
	London, Nov. 11: Fasting for hours before a cholesterol test is a waste of time, a new study suggests.        
	Researchers found that the tests were as accurate if patients had eaten beforehand as if they had followed recommendations to fast for up to 14 hours.        
	They believe that the tests, millions of which are performed in hospitals across the country every year, could be made easier for patients to undergo without putting them at risk of a misdiagnosis.        
	 The tests measure the amount of cholesterol, a fatty substance which can clog arteries and trigger a heart attack, in the blood.        
	The National Health Service advises patients to fast before a cholesterol test because of fears that fat from food could affect the measurement.        
	Patients who forget to fast can find themselves turned away by the diagnostic centre or given another appointment.        
	More than 2.5 million people across the country who are on medication for high cholesterol have their levels tested regularly.        
	Millions more will have their cholesterol checked up to once a year, either because their doctor fears that they could be at risk of developing heart problems or as part of a general health check-up.        
	The study looked at data on tests on more than 300,000 people who took part in 68 studies in 21 countries across the world. The researchers found that while eating did affect the results of the test, a failure to fast did not change the score enough to have an impact on the test as a predictor of heart disease risk.        
	Prof. John Danish who led the research, published in the Journal of the American Medical Association (Jama), said: For decades, people have been asked to fast overnight before their cholesterol tests. These findings indicate that cholesterol measurements are at least as good  and probably somewhat better  when made without fasting.

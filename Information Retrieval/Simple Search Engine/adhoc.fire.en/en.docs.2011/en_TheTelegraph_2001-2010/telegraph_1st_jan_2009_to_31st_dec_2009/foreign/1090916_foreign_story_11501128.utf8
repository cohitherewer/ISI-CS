	Mingora (Swat), Sept. 15: Two months after the Pakistani Army wrested control of the Swat Valley from Taliban militants, a new campaign of fear has taken hold, with scores, perhaps hundreds, of bodies dumped on the streets.         
	Human rights advocates and local residents say this is the work of the military. In some cases, people may simply have been seeking revenge against the ruthless Taliban in a society that tends to accept tit-for-tat reprisals, local politicians said.        
	But the scale of the retaliation, the similarities in the way that many of the victims have been tortured and the systematic nature of the deaths and disappearances in areas that the military firmly controls have led local residents, human rights workers and some Pakistani officials to conclude that the military has had a role in the campaign.        
	The Pakistani Army, which is supported by the US and in the absence of effective political leadership is running much of Swat with an iron hand, has strenuously denied any involvement in the killings. It has acknowledged that bodies have turned up, but its spokesmen assert that the killings are the result of civilians settling scores.        
	There are no extrajudicial killings in our system, said Colonel Akhtar Abbas, the army spokesman in Swat. If something happens, we have a foolproof accountability system.         
	But neighbours of the victims and Swat residents say there is something more going on than revenge killings by civilians.        
	A senior politician from the region and a former interior minister, Aftab Ahmed Sherpao, said he was worried about the armys involvement in the killings. There have been reports of extrajudicial killings by the military that are of concern, he said. This will not help bring peace.        
	Pakistans military operations against the Taliban in Swat, begun in May under public pressure from the US, has been hailed by Washington as a showcase effort of the armys newfound resolve to defeat the militants.         
	The American ambassador, Anne W. Patterson, visited Mingora, the biggest town in Swat, last week, becoming the first senior American official to go to Swat since the army took over.        
	Now, concerns over the armys methods in the area threaten to further taint Washingtons association with the military, cooperation that has been questioned in Congress.

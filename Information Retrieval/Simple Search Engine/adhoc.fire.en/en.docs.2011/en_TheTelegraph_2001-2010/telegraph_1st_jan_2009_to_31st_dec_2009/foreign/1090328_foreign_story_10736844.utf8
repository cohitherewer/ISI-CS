	Oddest book    
	 London, March 27 (Reuters): The prize for oddest book title of 2008 was awarded to The 2009-2014 World Outlook for 60-milligram Containers of Fromage Frais, thanks to a late surge in popularity, The Bookseller magazine said today.      
	Philip M. Parkers Fromage Frais, which literally means fresh cheese in French, beat out titles such as Baboon Metaphysics, Curbside Consultation of the Colon, and Strip and Knit with Style in the annual competition run by the British magazine.      
	According to online bookstore www.Amazon.com, Parkers book costs a stunning $795. The website gives no indication as to what it is about, but it takes up to two months to deliver.      
	Parkers book claimed first place with 32 per cent of the 5,034 votes cast on the Bookseller.com, beating out early favourite Techniques for Corrosion Monitoring. Baboon Metaphysics placed second with 22 per cent of the vote, while Colon trailed close behind with 18 per cent.    
	Love birds    
	 London: Love-sick birds have been plaguing a village by pecking and cracking car wing mirrors in the mistaken belief that their reflection is a potential mate, reports The Daily Telegraph. The situation has become so bad that motorists in Withycombes main street have taken to making special mittens to protect their mirrors from the onslaughts. The culprits have been identified as a flock of grey wagtails that live beside the local stream in the West Somerset village. The birds become obsessed by mirrors at this time of year as they carve out their territories in readiness for mating, not only pecking the mirrors but soiling the paintwork as they do so.     
	Spy home    
	 London: A farmhouse once owned by an Enigma code intelligence chief and rumoured to be a former training base for spies is for sale for 5.1 million, reports The Daily Telegraph. The Cotswolds farmhouse was owned by Frederick Winterbotham, the RAF officer responsible for distributing the intelligence gleaned from the cracking of German enigma codes at Bletchley Park.

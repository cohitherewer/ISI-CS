The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Obama girls try to fit in
                                                                                                               Obama girls try to fit in

	Washington, Jan. 6: Hard enough to be the new kid transferring mid-year into any school in a new town, but consider some of the special scrutiny visited upon young Malia and Sasha Obama yesterday as they started classes at Sidwell Friends.        
	First, make sure you look super-cute for the morning photos with Mom and Dad  cause theyre going on the Internet. (Youre living in a hotel, but must try to look normal.) When you get to class, just fit in  even though everybody knows who you are, and will be staring, even if theyre trying not to stare, because your father is going to be the President.        
	Usually the recommencement of classes at a private school do not warrant breaking updates: The girls motorcade left the Hay-Adams Hotel for Sidwell Friends School. They arrived early! Several hours went by. Then they left!        
	Meanwhile the Sidwell administration, which is accustomed to hosting the progeny of executive office-holders, did its best to make yesterday seem mundane. Its been a very normal day, the first day after winter break, said Ellis Turner, associate headmaster at Sidwell. Nothing special was prepared for any of our students.        
	Utterly normal. Except, of course, for the comings-and-goings of the soon-to-be first daughters: Malia, 10, now a fifth-grader at the schools Northwest Washington campus on Wisconsin Avenue, and Sasha, 7, a second-grader at the Bethesda campus not far up the road.        
	The media did their usual stakeout thing to record the historic occasion. We can reliably report some details, such as: Sasha carried a JanSport Trans backpack with a camouflage pattern of pink, magenta, gray and white camouflage. Attached to the backpack was a turquoise, three-eyed Uglydoll keychain.        
	What precisely happened in the girls classrooms was not publicly announced  the school, parents and students are trying to maintain a news blackout  but we assume that some sort of teaching took place. Also, discreet gawking. We were told to act normally, said one student, who declined to be identified for fear of violating school omerta. But people were looking out the windows anyway.        
	After the lunch bell rang, he saw Malia in the cafeteria. She seemed to fit in like any other student. It looked like she made friends on her first day. She seemed very happy, she was skipping and smiling, she already had a lot of friends around her.        
	 The schools custom is to make newcomers feel comfortable. They really do make a big deal of welcoming new kids in, said one elementary-school parent, citing the experience of his own first-grader.

                              Kristol                            
	Washington, Sept. 19 (AP): Irving Kristol, the political writer and publisher known as the godfather of American neoconservatism whose youthful radicalism evolved into an emphatic rejection of communism and the counterculture, died yesterday. He was 89.        
	Kristol was the husband of critic-historian Gertrude Himmelfarb and father of neo-conservative editor and commentator William Kristol, an editor of The Weekly Standard. A Trotskyist in the 1930s, Kristol would soon sour on socialism, break from liberalism after the rise of the New Left in the 1960s and in the 1970s commit the unthinkable for him: support the Republican Party.

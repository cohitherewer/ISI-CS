	Kathmandu, Nov. 12 (AP): Tens of thousands of Maoist demonstrators blocked the streets leading to the government headquarters in Nepals capital and scuffled with police today in one of the biggest protests against the President and administration in months.        
	Demonstrators prevented officials from entering the area, shutting down many government functions. Hundreds of riot police armed with batons guarded the complex. Irrigation minister Bal Krishna Khad said only four cabinet ministers managed to reach their offices before the protest began. Most government employees were unable to get to work.        
	Protests by Maoist supporters have grown in size throughout the country in recent weeks. Maoist leader Pushpa Kamal Dahal, who quit as Prime Minister in May, said the protests would continue until the government resigns.

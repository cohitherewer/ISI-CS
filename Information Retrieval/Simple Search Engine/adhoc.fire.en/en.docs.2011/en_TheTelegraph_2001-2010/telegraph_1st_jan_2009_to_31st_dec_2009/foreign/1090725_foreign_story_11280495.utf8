          KRISSAH THOMPSON AND CHERYL W. THOMPSON                          Sergeant James Crowley                                  
	Cambridge (Massachusetts), July 24: What began as a prominent African-American professors dispute with a white police sergeant grew more complex yesterday as the officer spoke publicly for the first time and a fuller portrait of his life emerged.         
	Sergeant James Crowley said Harvard scholar Henry Louis Gates Jr. was combative from the moment the officer arrived at his house last week to respond to a call about a possible burglary. As the confrontation escalated, Crowley said he warned Gates that he risked arrest. The second warning was with me holding a set of handcuffs in my hands  something I really didnt want to do, Crowley said.         
	The professor at any time could have resolved the issue by quieting down and/or going back inside his house.        
	Crowleys account came on a day of dizzying debate over his actions, a furore that was touched off by President Obamas remarks at a news conference on Wednesday night, when he said the police had acted stupidly.        
	 Yesterday, the Cambridge police commissioner, Robert C. Haas, described the department as deeply pained by Obamas criticism and said Crowley had followed proper protocol in making the arrest. I do not believe his actions were in any way racially motivated, Haas said. Sergeant Crowley is a stellar member of this department and I rely on his judgment every day.

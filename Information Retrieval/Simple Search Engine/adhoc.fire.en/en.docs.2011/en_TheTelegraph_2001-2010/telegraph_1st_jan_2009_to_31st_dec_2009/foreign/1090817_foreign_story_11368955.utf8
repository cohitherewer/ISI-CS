	Dylan who?     
	 Los Angeles (PTI): A policewoman in New Jersey recently failed to recognise Bob Dylan and asked the singer to produce his identity card. The young cop picked up the legendary singer after locals reported about a scruffy man acting suspiciously. The singer tried to explain who he was but could not convince the cop. She insisted on escorting him to his hotel and later phoned her colleagues to ask if they had heard of Bob Dylan. He was let off only after the hotel staff vouched for him.

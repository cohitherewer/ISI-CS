The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | 9 killed in Taliban bombings
                                                                                                               9 killed in Taliban bombings
                            
	Kabul, July 21 (Reuters): At least nine people were killed when Taliban guerrillas, including waves of suicide bombers, launched a series of daring attacks in east Afghanistan today, officials said.        
	Suicide bombers attacked, or attempted to attack, government and security offices and a military post in two key eastern towns, Gardez and Jalalabad. Gunbattles raged in Gardez amid confused reports of the fighting.        
	In Gardez, capital of Paktia province, the US military said at least three suicide attacks were reported. The Taliban said 15 suicide bombers launched attacks against government buildings.        
	Separately, two would-be suicide bombers attempted to attack a military outpost near the airport in Jalalabad, a former Taliban stronghold and capital of Nangarhar province, bordering Pakistan.        
	The Taliban, leading a growing insurgency against the western-backed government and seeking to drive foreign forces out of Afghanistan, claimed responsibility for both attacks. Violence has surged across Afghanistan since thousands of US Marines and British troops launched major new offensives in Helmand province.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Kim dying of cancer, says report
                                                                                                               Kim dying of cancer, says report

	Seoul, July 13: North Korean leader Kim Jong-il, who suffered a stroke last August, was also found to have life-threatening pancreatic cancer around the same time, a South Korean cable television network reported today.        
	The network, YTN, a cable news channel, quoted unidentified Chinese and South Korean intelligence sources for the report, which was made by YTNs Beijing-based correspondent.        
	YTN did not explain how the sources obtained such medical information about Kim from North Korea, an isolated, nuclear-armed state that historically has kept details of its leaders health a closely guarded secret.         
	But if the diagnosis of pancreatic cancer is true, Kim may not have much longer to live. Pancreatic cancer is one of the most difficult diseases to detect early, it spreads rapidly and the fatality rate is high. The World Health Organisation says fewer than 5 per cent of patients with pancreatic cancer live longer than five years.        
	Although Kim began making occasional public appearances a few months after he mysteriously disappeared last August, photographs of him and television images recently carried by the North Korean media showed him limping and frail. Kims loss of weight, in particular, has elevated speculation about the severity and nature of what is wrong with him.        
	His health and who is going to succeed him at the top of one of the worlds most secretive states are most intensely monitored issues. Kim looked gaunt during a public appearance last Wednesday at a memorial for his father, the founder of North Korea, Kim Il-sung. Kim inherited power after his father died in 1994 at the age of 82.         
	American intelligence officials said last autumn that Kim was seriously ill, although the exact nature of his illnesses has been a matter of speculation.        
	A French neurosurgeon who has treated Kim said the North Korean leader did have a stroke last August. In December, the doctor, Franois-Xavier Roux, told Le Figaro, the French daily newspaper: Kim Jong-il suffered a stroke but did not undergo an operation. He is now better.        
	North Korea is one of the worlds most unpredictable nations, and any transfer of power will focus new attention on its nuclear arsenal. In May, North Korea tested its second nuclear device in a move that shocked and angered the international community.

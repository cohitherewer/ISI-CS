The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Uighur mother looms large 
                                                                                                               Uighur mother looms large 
          DAVID MONTGOMERY                          Rebiya Kadeer in Washington. (AFP)                                  
	Washington, July 9: The translators kept bursting into tears.         
	That was a problem for Rebiya Kadeer, the tiny and fiery matriarch of the Uighur diaspora, who lives in Fairfax county and who was leading a protest march on the Chinese embassy in Washington on Tuesday.         
	She was speaking Uighur, the Turkic language of her people. Unlike her younger translators who spelled one another at the bullhorn, Kadeer, 63, scarcely betrayed weakness in the fierce planes and furrows of her face. Although the Chinese embassy said she instigated the bloody rioting in her homeland in far western China, she looked almost serene.         
	Her problem: How do you get the message to the wider world, via the assembled television cameras, if the message comes out soused and doused in sobs and wailing? Or maybe that is the message.         
	The violence this week leaves many Uighurs in a state of pure, helpless emotion. Some say loved ones have been killed. Others cant reach friends and fear the worst.         
	The riots and the crackdown in Urumqi, the capital of the Xinjiang region, are proving to be a perverse opportunity. For much of their history, the Uighurs have been a relatively obscure, Muslim ethnic minority. This week they have been elevated closer to the Tibetans in terms of publicity for civil rights struggles in China.         
	This is the Uighurs moment. And Kadeer, they say, is their mother. Every day Uighurs are dying! Kadeer said through a now-composed translator. I consider myself the voice of millions of Uighur people. I consider myself as their tears.         
	Chinese officials say Kadeers role in the recent bloodshed is more than symbolic. The Associated Press cites officials saying they have a recording of Kadeer speaking by phone to a relative in Urumqi, discussing in advance demonstrations that occurred last weekend.         
	Kadeer rejects the charge. She says she indeed called her brother to alert him to announcements being circulated by others on the Internet. I urged my brother to stay at home that day, and to ask my other family members to stay at home as well, fearing that they may be subject to violence at the hands of the authorities if they ventured outside, she said. In no way did I call on anyone, at any time, to demonstrate.        
	Kadeer said she condemned any violence committed by Uighurs, but blamed the authorities: The Chinese police provoked the violence.        
	The metaphorical mother of millions has 11 children of her own. Two of her sons are in prison in China. A former laundress, she built a successful business empire in trade, retail and restaurants and was hailed by the government as proof that opportunity exists in China. She joined the national government consultative body.         
	But she used her prominence to support Uighur causes and spoke against what she considered assaults on Uighur rights and culture. She was jailed in 1999 for allegedly passing intelligence  in the form of publicly available news articles  to foreigners. Freed in 2005, she was exiled to the US.

	Islamabad, April 11 (PTI) The Pakistani Taliban have begun to enforce Islamic law in the Bajaur tribal region, which borders Afghanistans Kunar province, as militants consolidated their hold on Buner district, 100km from the capital.         
	Maulvi Faqir Mohammad, the militant commander in Bajaur and a deputy of Tehrik-e-Taliban Pakistan chief Baitullah Mehsud, announced the decision to enforce Sharia during a broadcast on his illegal FM radio station yesterday.         
	The Taliban have already enforced Sharia in the Swat Valley after a signing a peace deal with the Pakistan government.         
	Mohammad barred women from stepping out of their homes without male relatives, banned shaving of beards and warned people not to seek assistance from the Benazir Income Support Programme, a government project that provides financial aid to women.        
	During a 40-minute speech on the radio, Mohammad said he and his fighters would spare no effort to strictly implement Islamic laws in the region. The Taliban have formed an action group to ensure that Shariah is enforced and to punish those who violate their edicts.         
	He said that shaving of beards and men not wearing skull caps are practices of Jews and their followers which the Taliban would not allow in Bajaur. People who listened to his radio broadcast described Mohammads tone as aggressive.         
	Scores of Taliban fighters from Swat who entered Buner district have started to take control of more areas, including the shrine of Sufi saint Pir Baba. Earlier, after peace talks with a tribal jirga, the militants had announced that they would pull out of Buner.         
	The security forces offered no resistance as the militants took over more areas, the Dawn newspaper reported.         
	They have taken control of vast areas in Buner. They are freely moving around while police and other law enforcement personnel remain confined to their posts, said a man who lives near the Pir Baba shrine.        
	Local residents said the militants had occupied the homes of influential people organising an anti-Taliban lashkar or militia and were patrolling the road leading to Daggar, the headquarters of Buner district.         
	 Militants set on fire TV sets, pictures and paintings and audio and video cassettes before Friday prayers. They locked the shrine and stopped followers of the saint from visiting the site.        
	They also delivered sermons in village mosques. We have been asked by our seniors not to interfere with the Taliban, an officer of the Pir Baba police station told Dawn.        
	He said the Taliban had better weapons, some of which he had never seen before.         
	The officer said the militants had not harmed anyone so far. Their prime targets have already fled, he added.         
	 A militant spokesman announced that people who had fled the area should return to their homes. He warned that those who had taken up arms against the Tailban would not be spared.         
	Residents said the militants met hundreds of local people. The Taliban were also seen patrolling several parts of Buner in seized vehicles.

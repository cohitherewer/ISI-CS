	Monday, March 9: The world is falling into the first global recession since World War II as the crisis that started in the US engulfs once-booming developing nations, confronting them with massive financial shortfalls that could turn back the clock on poverty reduction by years, the World Bank has warned.        
	It also cautioned that the cost of helping poorer nations in crisis would exceed the current financial resources of multilateral lenders. Such aid could prove critical to political stability as concerns mount over unrest in poorer nations generated by their sharp reversal of fortunes as private investment evaporates and global trade collapses.         
	In its report, the World Bank called on developed nations struggling with their own economic routs to dedicate 0.7 per cent of the money they spend on stimulus programmes towards a new Vulnerability Fund to help developing countries.         
	The report predicted that the global economy would shrink this year for the first time since the 1940s, reducing earlier estimates that emerging markets would propel the world to positive growth even as the US, Europe and Japan tanked.        
	 The dire prediction underscored what many are calling a mounting crisis within a crisis, as the downturn that started in the wealthy nations of the West washes over developing countries through a pullback in investment, trade and credit. Despite Americas position as the epicentre of the crisis, investors are flocking to US treasury bills and the dollar, squeezing developing nations out of global credit markets.        
	The report said that 94 out of 116 developing countries have been hit by economic slowdowns. The World Bank projected that the economic crisis will push around 46 million people into poverty in 2009 through job and wage cuts, as well as declining flows of remittances, the money that foreign workers send to their families.        
	Net private capital flows to emerging markets are plunging, set to fall to $165 billion this year  or 17 per cent of their 2007 levels. Falling demand in the West is sparking the sharpest drop in world trade in 80 years, sending sales of the products and commodities of poorer nations spiralling down, the report said.        
	That decline is touching off a wave of job losses. In India, more than half a million jobs vanished in the last three months of 2008, including cuts in the gem, jewellery, auto and textile industries.

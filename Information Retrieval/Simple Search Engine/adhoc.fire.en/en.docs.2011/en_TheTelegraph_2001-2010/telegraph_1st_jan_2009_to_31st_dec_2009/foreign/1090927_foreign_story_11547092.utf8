	Seoul, Sept. 26 (Reuters): Ninety-seven South Koreans crossed a heavily armed border today to meet family members in the communist North in fleeting reunions arranged by the rivals.        
	The reunion at the North Korean resort of Mount Kumgang was an outpouring of sorrow, joy and relief as family members lost for more than half a century were reunited.

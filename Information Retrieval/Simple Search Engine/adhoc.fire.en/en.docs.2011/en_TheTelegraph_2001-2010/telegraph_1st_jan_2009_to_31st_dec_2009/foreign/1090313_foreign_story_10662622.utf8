	Islamabad, March 12 (Agencies): Opposition activists and lawyers today set off on a cross-country protest march in Pakistan amid a crackdown that stirred memories of the confrontation that eventually led to the ouster of former President Pervez Musharraf.        
	The latest showdown is threatening to destabilise the one-year-old Asif Ali Zardari government at a time of rising militant violence. If the crisis gets out of hand, the army could feel compelled to intervene, though analysts have little expectation that Pakistan would revert to military rule so soon.        
	Several layers of back-channel efforts, including one by the US ambassador, to break the deadlock have been reported and some hints of compromise have been dropped over the past two days. However, till late this evening, there has been little sign of a solution.        
	US ambassador Anne Patterson met Opposition leader and former Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif in a bid to resolve the crisis. President Barack Obamas special envoy Richard Holbrooke is also learnt to have spoken to Zardari.        
	The Pakistan government offered talks on Sharifs key demands  restoration of independent judges and his brothers government in Punjab  but the Opposition refused to relent till this evening.        
	The government fears that the protests are aimed at toppling Zardari because the march has brought together many of the same groups that helped push Musharraf from the presidency last September. The then protests built steadily after Musharraf, then both the President and the army chief, dismissed the chief justice.        
	The Opposition feels that Zardari has refused to reinstate former Chief Justice Iftikhar Chaudhry as the judge could nullify an amnesty Musharraf granted the President and his late wife Benazir Bhutto.        
	The civilian government has banned public rallies, arrested hundreds of political workers and police clashed with some protesters.        
	But the government said it was not against the so-called long march that seeks to converge on Islamabad on Monday.        
	Interior ministry chief Rehman Malik said the long march that set out from the cities of Karachi and Quetta would be allowed to go ahead.         
	Sharifs spokesperson Sadiqul Farooq said ambassador Patterson was trying to get things resolved between the Opposition and the government. It is not only the American ambassador, other friendly countries are in contact.        
	As the march got under way, a coalition partner said Zardari had agreed to two Opposition demands, without giving details. In another sign of possible compromise, Prime Minister Yousaf Raza Gilani said late yesterday, after meeting the army chief, the government wanted central rule in Punjab to end.        
	The protests are expected to gather strength as people in Punjab  Sharifs political power base  setoff for the capital over the weekend.        
	A spokesperson for Sharif said the government had hatched a plot to kill him. Zardaris spokesperson dismissed that as political gimmickry and said the Sharif bothers had been promised full security.

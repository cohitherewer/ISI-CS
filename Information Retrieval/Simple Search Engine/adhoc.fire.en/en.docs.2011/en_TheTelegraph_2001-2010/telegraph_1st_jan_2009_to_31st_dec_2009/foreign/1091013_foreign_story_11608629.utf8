The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Woman held for virtual poke
                                                                                                               Woman held for virtual poke
          MATTHEW MOORE                              
	London, Oct. 12: A woman has been arrested for poking someone on Facebook, the social networking website.        
	Police deemed that 36-year-old Shannon Jackson violated a protection order  similar to a restraining order  by using the sites feature to attract the attention of another user. The order previously obtained by the woman who received the poke banned Jackson from telephoning, contacting or otherwise communicating with the petitioner.        
	 While police interventions to halt online harassment are not uncommon, this is believed to be one of the first cases of someone being detained for a poke  one of the most rudimentary forms of virtual communication.        
	The feature, which allows Facebook users to make themselves known to other users of the site without sending a message, is commonly used by members to say hello to their friends, or to flirt with people they do not know.        
	Police in Hendersonville, Tennessee, have obtained screen grabs of the victims Facebook page showing evidence of the poke, according to the local newspaper The Tennessean.        
	Jackson, who lives in Hendersonville, faces up to a year in prison and fine of $2,500 if she is found guilty of breaching the protection order. She is due to appear in court later this month.         
	Although Jackson declined to comment, her lawyer, Lawren Lassiter, told ABCNews.com that his client was extremely shocked when the police arrested her.        
	Although the poking angle may be unique, this is not the first time that Facebook communication has led to an arrest. Earlier this month a burglar in Italy was held after logging on to Facebook while carrying out a break-in.

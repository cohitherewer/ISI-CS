	New York, Nov. 30 (AP): Chelsea Clinton, the 29-year old daughter of former President Bill Clinton and secretary of state Hillary Rodham Clinton, has become engaged to her longtime boyfriend, investment banker Marc Mezvinsky.        
	The couple sent an email to friends yesterday announcing the news. The former President and the current secretary of state said they were looking at a possible wedding next summer. Matt McKenna, a spokesman for Bill Clinton, confirmed the engagement today.        
	Mezvinsky is a son of former Pennsylvania Representative Marjorie Margolies-Mezvinsky and former Iowa Representative Ed Mezvinsky, longtime friends of the Clintons.         
	Last summer, Hillary Clinton was forced to tamp down speculation that her daughter and Mezvinsky were already engaged and would marry in August. Those rumours proved to be false.         
	The couple became friends as teenagers in Washington and both attended Stanford University. They now live in New York, where Mezvinsky works at Goldman Sachs and Clinton is attending graduate school at Columbia Universitys School of Public Health.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Obama to Pak: stop supporting militants
                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      Obama to Pak: stop supporting militants
          KAREN DEYOUNG                          President Obama at a basketball game in Washington. (Reuters)                                  
	Washington, Nov. 30: President Obama has offered Pakistan an expanded strategic partnership, including additional military and economic cooperation, while warning with unusual bluntness that its use of insurgent groups to pursue policy goals cannot continue.        
	Obama called for closer collaboration against all extremist groups. His two-page letter delivered to President Asif Ali Zardari named five: al Qaida, the Afghan Taliban, the Haqqani network, Lashkar-e-Toiba and the Pakistani Taliban organisation known as Tehrik-e-Taliban. Using vague diplomatic language, he said that ambiguity in Pakistans relationship with any of them could no longer be ignored.        
	The offer, including an effort to help reduce tensions between Pakistan and India, was contained in the letter delivered this month by Obamas national security adviser James L. Jones. It was accompanied by assurances from Jones that the US will increase its military and civilian efforts in Afghanistan and that it plans no early withdrawal.        
	Obamas speech at the US Military Academy at West Point, New York, later will address primarily the Afghanistan aspects of the strategy. But despite the public and political attention focused on the number of new troops, Pakistan has been the hot core of the months-long strategy review. The long-term consequences of failure there, the review concluded, far outweigh those in Afghanistan.        
	We cant succeed without Pakistan, a senior administration official involved in the White House review said. You have to differentiate between public statements and reality. There is nobody who is under any illusions about this.        
	This official and others, all of whom spoke about the closely held details of the new strategy on the condition of anonymity, emphasised that without changing the nature of US-Pakistan relations in a new direction, youre not going to win in Afghanistan, as one put it.         
	Jones, a retired Marine Corps general, was more precise in conversations with top Pakistani government and military leaders, US and foreign officials said, stating that certain things have to happen in Pakistan to ensure Afghanistans security.         
	If Pakistan cannot deliver, he warned, the US may be impelled to use any means at its disposal to rout insurgents based along Pakistans western and southern borders with Afghanistan.        
	Current US policy includes the use of missiles fired from unmanned drones on insurgent locations limited to roughly 50 miles inside the western border; training in two military camps for the Pakistani Frontier Corps; and intelligence exchanges. It prohibits kinetic, or active, operations by US ground forces inside Pakistan.        
	While praising Pakistani military offensives against groups that pose a domestic threat  primarily the Tehrik-e-Taliban in the Swat Valley and South Waziristan  Jones made it clear that the administration expects more.        
	The rollout of the new strategy is being coordinated with principal US allies, including Britain, whose Prime Minister, Gordon Brown, said yesterday: People are going to ask why, eight years after 2001, Osama bin Laden has never been near to being caught.

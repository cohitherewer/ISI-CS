                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      Children, generals killed in Pak attack
          NASIR JAFFRY AND AGENCIES                          Pakistan troops rush to the mosque in Rawalpindi which was attacked by terrorists on Friday. (AP)                                  
	Islamabad, Dec. 4: Attackers lobbed grenades and opened fire on worshippers, mostly active and retired military officials, at a mosque in Rawalpindi during Friday prayers.        
	At least 40 people, including some children, were killed and more than 83 wounded, the military said.         
	An army statement issued tonight confirmed that those killed in the attack included one major general, one brigadier, two lieutenant colonels and one major.        
	 The attack stunned Pakistan for its brazenness and the apparent ease with which the attackers breached what should have been a secure area. Chief military spokesman Major General Athar Abbas said four militants hurled grenades, then opened fire as they rushed towards the mosque.         
	Two terrorists then blew themselves up inside the mosque while the other two militants were killed in an exchange of gunfire, he said. The mosque was located on Parade Lane close to several military buildings and residences of senior army officials. The site of the attack was just a few kilometres from the armys General Headquarters, which was stormed by militants on October 10.         
	I was offering prayers in a nearby mosque when I heard a huge blast followed by intense firing, Iqbal Javed, a computer engineers, told The Telegraph. He said it was just as if hell had broken loose in Rawalpindi. I rushed to the site, which was cordoned off by the army and police personnel and saw several ambulances , said Javed.         
	Interior minister Rehman Malik told reporters that the militants entered the mosque disguised as worshippers. He confirmed that the number of suicide bombers was four. A senior police official, who took part in the operation, told The Telegraph on condition of anonymity that all the terrorists had been killed.         
	He said two militants were killed while two others blew themselves up when surrounded by security personnel. They had hand grenades. They threw these grenades on the worshippers and then opened fire, the official said.        
	A witness, Nasir Ali, said the attackers also threw grenades into the womens section of the mosque.         
	I could only hear the shouting of the people. We couldnt help each other at all, Ali told Dawn television, describing how he hid from the attackers. It was a hopeless situation. About 30 or 35 people were lying dead in front of me.        
	As the latest army campaign unfolded in South Waziristan, militants have increasingly struck at the military. Witnesses said the attackers managed to circumvent strict security measures in the area to launch the assault.        
	Ali said that he saw two assailants clad in long white tunics girded with ammunition belts entering the mosque from either side and opening fire on worshippers.        
	The mosque can accommodate at least 200 people, but it was not clear how many were present when the attack took place.         
	Pakistani news reports suggested that the attackers clambered over a rear wall to gain access. The attack left the walls and floor of the mosque spattered with blood.        
	Rawalpindi, the headquarters of the Pakistani Army, has been a frequent target of militants in recent months as a government offensive against Taliban rebels continues in South Waziristan.

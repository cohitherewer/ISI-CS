The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Mousavi to attend prayers
                                                                                                               Mousavi to attend prayers
          NAZILA FATHI AND SHARON OTTERMAN                          Mousavi: Defiant                                  
	New York, July 16: The Iranian Opposition leader, Mir Hossein Mousavi, will attend Friday prayers at Tehran University, making his first appearance at an official event since unrest began over the nations disputed presidential election, a statement on his website said.        
	The prayers, which are normally broadcast throughout the country, will be led by the influential former President Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani, state news agencies said. Rafsanjani is a rival of President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad but has not commented publicly on the post-election turmoil.         
	The Opposition insists the election was rigged in favour of the declared victor, Ahmadinejad.         
	Opposition supporters vowed on websites and social networking sites to show up at the prayers in force. There were reports that green prayer mats  the colour symbolising both Islam and the Opposition  were sold out across the city.        
	The Opposition has not held a street protest since last Thursday, when thousands poured into central Tehran before being dispersed by security forces firing tear gas and wielding wooden truncheons. In the days after the June 12 vote, thousands of protesters took to the streets, but their numbers have dwindled in the face of a heavy government crackdown.        
	The vast hall at Tehran University where prayers are held was expected to be stacked tomorrow with government supporters, and the intelligence minister, Gholamhossein Mohseni-Ejei, was quoted by the Fars News Agency as warning Iranians to not turn the sermon into an arena for undesirable scenes.        
	Ahmadinejad, who embarked today on a provincial trip to the northeastern city of Mashhad under heavy security, is not expected to attend the prayers. Today, he addressed a large crowd of supporters and blamed Irans external enemies for the turmoil over the elections.         
	In this recent election the enemy tried to bring the battlefront to the interior of this country, Ahmadinejad was quoted by the official Irna news agency as saying.         
	Nuclear chief quits        
	In another development that appeared to show strains within the highest ranks of Iranian government after the election, the head of the Iranian Atomic Energy Organisation, Gholamreza Aghazadeh, said that he had resigned from his post three weeks ago, the semi-official Isna news agency reported today.        
	The announcement of his resignation from a highly sensitive position came as a surprise.         
	Irans nuclear programme is under heavy pressure from the US and other nations who accuse Iran of secretly building a nuclear weapons capability.         
	There is seldom turnover at the head of the agency; Aghazadeh held the post for 12 years. The report gave no reason for his resignation, but he has long been an ally of both Mousavi and Rafsanjani.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Healthcare measure clears Senate
                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      Healthcare measure clears Senate
                            
	Washington, Dec. 24 (Reuters): The US Senate approved President Barack Obamas healthcare overhaul today, backing sweeping changes in the medical insurance market and new coverage for tens of millions of uninsured Americans.        
	On a party-line 60-39 vote, Senate Democrats supported the most dramatic shifts in health policy in four decades. The early-morning Christmas Eve vote followed months of political wrangling that consumed the US Congress and put a dent in Obamas ratings.        
	This is a victory for the American people, Senate Democratic leader Harry Reid said.

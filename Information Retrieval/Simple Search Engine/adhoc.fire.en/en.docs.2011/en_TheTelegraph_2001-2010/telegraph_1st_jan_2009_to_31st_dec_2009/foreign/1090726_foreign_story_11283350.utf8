The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Ahmadinejad deputy quits
                                                                                                               Ahmadinejad deputy quits
          ROBERT F. WORTH AND NAZILA FATHI                          Esfandiar Rahim Mashaei                                  
	Dubai, July 25: In the latest sign of dissension within Irans conservative ranks, President Mahmoud Ahmadinejads new deputy withdrew yesterday in response to a letter demanding his removal written by the supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, state television and news agencies reported.         
	Today, Irans Opposition urged senior clerics to help secure the release of people arrested following Junes disputed presidential election after a protester died in prison.        
	A reformist website said the son of an adviser to defeated conservative candidate Mohsen Rezaie had been killed in a Tehran prison after being detained in post-election unrest.        
	The resignation resolved a week of acrimony over the deputy, Esfandiar Rahim Mashaei, who had drawn fierce criticism from hardliners over comments he made last year that were friendly to Israel. It also underscored the authority within Irans Islamic political system of Ayatollah Khamenei, whose handwritten letter  made public by state television yesterday  appeared to have overridden Ahmadinejads persistent refusal to dismiss his trusted deputy. The dispute may also be a sign that Ahmadinejad is more vulnerable to conservative rivals in the wake of last months election.         
	The existence of Ayatollah Khameneis letter was made public several days ago, but Ahmadinejad refused to back down, despite a withering campaign by conservatives. The criticism peaked yesterday, when hundreds of hard-line students rallied in Tehran to demand Mashaeis ouster and a prominent ayatollah chastised Ahmadinejad for flouting the supreme leaders wishes.         
	Finally, Ayatollah Khameneis letter was cited in full on state television late yesterday, in a gesture apparently meant to force the issue.         
	The promotion of Mashaei was contrary to your interests and the interests of the government, and will be a cause of division and distress among your supporters, the letter stated.         
	Even then, Ahmadinejad appears not to have fired Mashaei. Instead, a top presidential aide, Mojtaba Samara Hashemi, told the official Irna news agency that Mashaei doesnt consider himself first vice-president in the wake of Ayatollah Khameneis letter.

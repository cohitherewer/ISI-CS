The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Green gum that does not stick goes on sale
                                                                                                               Green gum that does not stick goes on sale

	London, March 30: An eco-friendly chewing gum that does not stick to pavements has gone on sale in Britain for the first time.         
	Chicza Rainforest Gum  the worlds only biodegradable gum  turns to dust within six weeks of being discarded.         
	The new product promises to bring an end to the costly task of removing used gum from streets and other public surfaces.         
	It costs councils 150 million a year to clear away discarded gum, a notoriously difficult process that can involve chemical sprays, long-handed scrapers, freezing treatments and high pressure hot water machines.         
	Unlike rival products which contain petrochemicals, Chicza Rainforest Gum is made from the sap of the chicle tree grown in Mexico. It is produced by Consorcio Chiclero, a consortium of 56 co-operatives employing 2,000 farmers, according to The Guardian.         
	Its non-stick qualities also apply to clothes, which will come as a relief to anyone who has accidentally sat on a blob of chewed gum.         
	Consorcio Chiclero is not the first company to work on an easy-to-remove gum. In 2007 The Irish ministry of the environment offered a one million euro prize, through an open competition, to any Irish university or college to develop a non-stick chewing gum.         
	That year a team from the University of Bristol released details of a less sticky gum that it claimed was as flavourful as leading brands.

	Comic actor Tim Allen is a father for the second time.        
	Publicist Marleah Leslie says Allens wife, Jane, gave birth to a 2.6-kg girl, Elizabeth, on Saturday in Los Angeles.         
	Leslie says the couple is thrilled with the new arrival, and both mother and child are healthy.

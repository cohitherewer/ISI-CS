	Dera Ismail Khan (Pakistan), Oct. 19 (Reuters): Pakistani forces backed by heavy artillery attacked Taliban insurgents today as the army moved to wrest control of militant strongholds in a lawless region on the Afghan border.        
	The fighting is a new test of the governments determination to tackle an increasingly brazen insurgency that has seen a string of attacks in different parts of the country, including an assault on army headquarters, in which more than 150 people were killed.        
	The conflict in what is considered a global hub for Islamic militants is being closely followed by the US and other powers already embroiled in Afghanistan. Today, General David Petraeus, commander of US forces in the region, was in Pakistan for talks.        
	With the Pakistani army claiming progress in fighting the Taliban in South Waziristan, analysts expect resistence to weaken as the militants are squeezed out of their strongholds.        
	When forces take over Waziristan than you will definitely see the resistance waning, said retired Brigadier Asad Munir, a former ISI officer, who said he expected operations to take at least six weeks.        
	Today, residents of Wana, the main urban centre in South Waziristan, said there had been heavy fighting overnight. There has been artillery fire throughout the night. It was very heavy firing, Noor Wali said.        
	The army said yesterday that 60 militants and five soldiers had been killed in the first 24 hours of the long-awaited offensive.

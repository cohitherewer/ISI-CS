The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Tiger raids fail to stop army advance
                                                                                                               Tiger raids fail to stop army advance
                            
	Colombo, May 13 (PTI): Tamil Tigers launched a wave of suicide attacks on land and on sea, using boats packed with explosives.        
	However, it failed to stall the advance of Sri Lankan forces who broke through their defences. The fighting killed 44 rebels and many soldiers were wounded.         
	The Lankan Army beat back a ferocious sea-borne suicide attack by the Sea Tigers in which three boats tried to hit troop positions on the shore to cause maximum casualties.         
	Several soldiers were wounded in the attack carried out late last night. Our naval boats and shore-based guns foiled the attack forcing the Sea Tigers into their own area, a military spokesman said.        
	The army later recovered a 55-feet long Sea Tiger boat carrying 1500kg of high explosives in Karayamullivaikkal. If the boat had been detonated, it would have caused large-scale casualties among the troops.         
	The army yesterday foiled three suicide attacks by Black Tigers which wounded some soldiers. Ten bombers were killed. Renewed heavy fighting raged as both sides ignored new international calls for ceasefire.

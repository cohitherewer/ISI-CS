The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Iran arrests 4 over US plot
                                                                                                               Iran arrests 4 over US plot
                            
	Tehran, Jan. 13 (Reuters): Four Iranians have been arrested for their alleged involvement in a US-financed plot aimed at toppling Irans system of government, the judiciary said today.        
	The announcement came a week before the inauguration of Barack Obama as President. In a shift from President Bushs approach, he has pledged to increase diplomatic efforts to engage Iran and talk directly to its leaders.        
	The US, which cut ties with Iran shortly after its 1979 Islamic revolution, accuses Tehran of seeking to build nuclear bombs. Iranian officials deny the charge, saying the nuclear programme is for electricity production.        
	The New York Times on Saturday said Bush had deflected an Israeli request last year for bunker-busting bombs it wanted for an attack on Irans nuclear complex, saying he had authorised covert action to sabotage its suspected atomic arms development.        
	Judiciary spokesman Alireza Jamshidi said the accused, who he said were financed by the US government and Congress, were arrested in Tehran and their verdicts would be announced soon.        
	The news whose details which will be announced either tomorrow or the day after is in connection to a soft network whose intent was to topple (the Islamic system), with US government funding, Jamshidi told a news conference.        
	One of the goals these individuals were pursuing in Iran was to set up a network to topple the Islamic establishment, all of whose operators have been arrested, he said.        
	Jamshidi said the group, whom he did not identify, had tried to recruit other people in Iran and train them both in and outside the country in techniques for undermining the system. He did not provide details.        
	The official Irna news agency also quoted him as saying that the CIA had been involved in establishing and guiding the network. Unfortunately we have witnessed in the past years crimes guided or led by this (US) government, Jamshidi said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Apple races to stay ahead of rivals
                                                                                                               Apple races to stay ahead of rivals
          BRAD STONE                           hit device                                  
	San Francisco, June 6: With its coveted gadgets and resurgent stock price, Apple has cast something of a spell on both consumers and investors.         
	At its annual Worldwide Developers Conference, which begins here on Monday, Apple executives will try to sustain that magic, using what has become one of their highest-profile events of the year.         
	It will not be easy. While he is fond of surprises, Steven P. Jobs , Apples chief executive, whose personal star power has been known to amplify the companys message, is not likely to be there. The company says it continues to expect his return from medical leave at the end of the month.         
	Apple must also meet sky-high and perhaps unrealistic expectations from enthusiasts and analysts, and it is just as likely to draw attention for what it does not unveil as for what it does. That challenge is partly one of its own making. Apples strategy  particularly with the iPhone  has come to depend on a steady stream of hit devices that are viewed by consumers as being so far ahead of the competition that they are worth paying extra money.         
	But the competition is now catching up. Palm , Google , Microsoft, Nokia and Research in Motion, maker of the BlackBerry, are all at varying stages of developing and introducing their own iPhone-like devices and software, along with easily accessible stores for the small programmes known as applications, or apps, that run on those devices.         
	In some cases, those companies are releasing a greater variety of phones, on more wireless carriers around the world, than Apple.         
	To maintain its advantage, Apple must preserve the impression that it is far ahead of rivals when it comes to the capabilities and the cool factor of its devices.         
	If they start making products people dont want, and start losing users, then Apples strategy will run into problems, said Benjamin Reitzes, an analyst at Barclays Capital. If they continue to have an aura where their products are seen as defining the marketplace, they are going to be fine. But thats going to be the challenge and the opportunity for Apple.         
	For now at least, Apple appears to have a comfortable lead in the simmering smartphone battle. In the last two years, it has sold more than 37 million iPhones and the similar-looking iPod Touches, and the devices have become its most profitable product category. Apples stock has nearly doubled in the last six months, largely on the iPhones inexorable momentum, although it is still down 28 per cent from its high in December 2007.         
	The iPhone has also attracted an enthusiastic community of independent software makers that have created about 40,000 free or low-cost applications for the devices. Apple now celebrates that wide range of programmes, from flight simulators to spreadsheets, as one of the major differences between the iPhone and competing systems.         
	Apples goal for next week: to keep the energy, momentum and spotlight focused on the iPhone and away from its rivals, like the new Pre from Palm, a well-reviewed new phone.         
	Apple is expected to use its keynote presentation on Monday to demonstrate the new types of programmes that can be created on the latest version of the iPhones operating system.         
	Developers will be able to charge for certain features within their programmes (perhaps a new level within a game), and applications will be able to send alerts to users even whey they are not actively running. Apple has also said it will show an early version of its latest operating system for the Macintosh, dubbed Snow Leopard.         
	But talking about new software can be dull. So analysts point to Apples need to surprise its fans, and to its dwindling inventory of iPhones in stores, and predict that Apple will introduce a new iPhone model next week as well.         
	Its new tricks could include the ability to record video and an internal compass that will add extra intelligence to the devices awareness of its location.         
	Apples objective will be to clearly and strongly show why the iPhone platform is the best for developers, and that means theres a high probability Apple will announce one or more phones at the conference, said Michael Abramsky, an analyst at RBC Capital Markets.

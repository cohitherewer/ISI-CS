The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | China loses film amp; book case
                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      China loses film amp; book case
                              US trade representative Ron Kirk. (AP)                            
	Geneva, Dec. 21 (AP): The World Trade Organisations top arbitrators upheld a ruling that China is illegally restricting imports of US music, films and books.        
	Washington also pushed forward with a new case accusing China of manipulating the prices for key ingredients in steel and aluminum production.        
	Todays verdict by the WTOs appellate body knocked down Chinas objections to an August decision that came down decisively against Beijings policy of forcing American media producers to route their business through state-owned companies.        
	If China fails over the next year to bring its practices in line with international trade law, the US can ask the WTO to authorise commercial sanctions against Chinese goods.        
	Today America got a big win, US trade representative Ron Kirk said. US companies and workers are at the cutting edge of these industries, and they deserve a full chance to compete under agreed WTO rules. We expect China to respond promptly to these findings and bring its measures into compliance.        
	The Asian countrys import restrictions have been a key gripe of western exporters, who complain that Chinas rapid rise as a trade juggernaut has been aided by unfair policies that boost sales of Chinese goods abroad while limiting the amount of foreign products entering the Chinese market.        
	The probe initiated today by the WTO  at the request of the US, Mexico and the 27-nation EU  focuses on the other half of the equation by examining Chinas treatment of domestic and foreign manufacturers with regards to its vast wealth of raw materials.        
	Washington and Brussels claim that China unfairly favours domestic industry by setting export quotas on materials such as coke, bauxite, magnesium and silicon metal. Export quotas are contentious under trade rules because they can cause a glut on the domestic market, driving down prices for local producers, while leading to scarcity and higher prices for competitors abroad.        
	Beijing, however, claims that the curbs are an effort to protect the environment, and says they comply with WTO rules.         
	For its part, China is challenging US trade rules on a number of issues such as poultry, and asked the WTO at the dispute body meeting today for a new investigation into American import taxes on Chinese tyres.        
	Analysts and observers believe these Sino-American trade fights are only the beginning as President Barack Obamas administration is likely to file more cases against China. Obama made campaign pledges to take a tougher approach with US trading partners in the face of soaring job losses.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Bomber hits Pak air base
                                                                                                               Bomber hits Pak air base

	Islamabad, Oct. 23 (Reuters): A Taliban suicide bomber killed eight people outside a key Pakistani air force facility today, with officials quick to deny suggestions the target was linked to the countrys nuclear programme.        
	The bomber detonated explosives strapped to his body at a checkpoint outside the Pakistan Aeronautical Complex in Kamra, 75km northwest of Islamabad.         
	Kamra is the air forces largest maintenance and research base. This was the second assault on the facility. The first attack took place in December 2007. The base also has combat jets equipped to carry nuclear warheads, reports said.        
	Hours later, a car bomb exploded outside a restaurant in Peshawar, wounding 15, two of them seriously, officials said.        
	Eight people were killed and 13 were wounded, three of them seriously, said Shaukat Sultan, head of the main government hospital in Kamra, scene of todays airbase attack.        
	According to US intelligence thinktank Stratfor, the strike against the Kamra complex is likely to raise renewed concerns about the safety of Pakistans nuclear weapons.                   
	An air force official quickly dispelled suggestions that the Kamra facility was linked to the weapons programme. Its nonsense. Its rubbish, the official said. The attack on the strategic Kamra base came nearly two weeks after the Taliban stormed the armys general headquarters in Rawalpindi, leaving 22 people dead.        
	Hours after the Kamra attack, militants exploded a landmine under a bus ferrying a marriage party killing at least 18 people, including women and children, and injuring six others in Pakistans Mohmand tribal region.         
	The incident took place in Lakaro sub-division, a remote region of Mohmand Agency where security forces are conducting operations against militants. The attacks were launched amid a major army offensive against Pakistani Taliban militant strongholds in South Waziristan.        
	Aid bill conditions        
	The US Congress today cleared a bill that imposes tough conditions on military assistance to Pakistan in order to make sure that the funds are not squandered or diverted to affect the balance of power in the region.

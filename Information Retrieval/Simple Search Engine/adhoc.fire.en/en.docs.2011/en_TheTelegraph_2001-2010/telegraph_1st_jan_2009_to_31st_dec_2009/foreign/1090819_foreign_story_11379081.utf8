The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Key Taliban spokesman held
                                                                                                               Key Taliban spokesman held
  - Militant mouthpiece admits Baitullah Mehsud killed in US attack                                
	Islamabad, Aug. 18 (AP): Security forces captured the Pakistan Talibans top spokesman, officials said today.        
	The spokesman, Maulvi Omar, also acknowledged the death of the groups leader in a recent US missile strike.        
	US and Pakistani officials have said they were almost certain that the chief, Baitullah Mehsud, had been killed in the August 5 strike, but at least three Taliban operatives, including Omar, had called media organisations following the attack to say he was still alive. Omars comments  relayed by an intelligence official who took part in the questioning  would be the first admission by the Taliban that Mehsud was dead. The official spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorised to speak to the media.        
	The spokesmans capture was the second arrest of a prominent Taliban figure in 24 hours, dealing another blow to the network blamed for scores of bloody attacks on western and government targets gnawing at the stability of Pakistan.        
	As the official spokesman for Tehrik-e-Taliban Pakistan, the umbrella organisation formed in 2007 for various regional and tribal militant movements, Omar frequently called journalists to claim responsibility for terrorist attacks in Pakistan. As well as being the movements mouthpiece, Omar was an influential aide to Mehsud and ranking member of the Taliban.        
	Omar initially operated relatively openly  a reflection of the former governments reluctance to tackle the group. Reporters had his home and mobile phone numbers. Omar would occasionally summon Pakistani reporters stationed in Khar, the main city in Bajur tribal region, for news conferences at his headquarters in nearby Mamund town.        
	But after the army began an offensive in April, Omar changed phone numbers frequently. He never appeared in public, but still continued to telephone the media with messages from the Taliban leadership. He was captured along with two associates in a village in the Mohmand tribal region last night while he was travelling in a car to South Waziristan, said Javed Khan, a local administrator.        
	Maulvi Umar is in our custody, and he is being questioned, Khan said.

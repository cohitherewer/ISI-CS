The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Face rebuilt using ribs, hips and wrist
                                                                                                               Face rebuilt using ribs, hips and wrist
                            
	London, Sept. 26: Mouth cancer sufferer Tim Gallego has had his face completely rebuilt using different parts of his body including his ribs, hips and wrists.        
	Tim, a father-of-three, has had to undergo 16 operations to have bones, skin and arteries from all over his body implanted into his face.        
	 The financial advisor had chunks of bone from his rib cage and his hips removed to form the structure of his new nose and jaw to hold in his new teeth.        
	Arteries from both his legs have been built into his neck and skin from his wrists grafted onto his lower face.        
	The 46-year-old was unable to talk for a whole year and couldnt eat or drink for two weeks after one of the many operations to aid his recovery.        
	Tim, who is married to Katie, also had frequent sessions in an oxygen chamber to encourage new facial blood vessels to develop.        
	Tim has now made a full recovery from his eight year ordeal and looks forward to looking into the mirror every morning to see his new self. He said: I seem to be running out of a supply of body parts now.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | India, not Taliban, is Paks main enemy
                                                                                                               India, not Taliban, is Paks main enemy

	Islamabad, April 6: President Obamas strategy of offering Pakistan a partnership to defeat the insurgency here calls for a virtual remaking of this nations institutions and even of the national psyche, an ambitious agenda that Pakistans politicians and people appear unprepared to take up.         
	Officially, Pakistans government welcomed Obamas strategy, with its hefty infusions of American money, hailing it as a positive change.         
	But as the Obama administration tries to bring Pakistanis to its side, large parts of the public, the political class and the military have brushed off the plan, rebuffing the idea that the threat from al Qaida and the Taliban, which Washington calls a common enemy, is so urgent.        
	Some, including the army chief, General Ashfaq Parvez Kayani, and the President, Asif Ali Zardari, may be coming around. But for the military, at least, India remains priority number one, as it has for the 61 years of Pakistans existence.        
	How to shift that focus in time for Pakistan to defeat a fast-expanding Islamic insurgency that threatens to devour the country is the challenge facing Admiral Mike Mullen, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and Richard C. Holbrooke, the special envoy to the region, as they arrive in Pakistan for talks.         
	Strengthening Pakistans weak civilian institutions, updating political parties rooted in feudal loyalties and recasting a military fixated on yesterdays enemy, and stuck in the traditions of conventional warfare, are generational challenges. But Pakistan may not have the luxury of the long term to meet them.         
	Some analysts here and in Washington are already putting forward apocalyptic timetables for the country. We are running out of time to help Pakistan change its present course towards increasing economic and political instability, and even ultimate failure, said a recent report by a task force of the Atlantic Council that was led by former Senator Chuck Hagel of Nebraska and Senator John Kerry of Massachusetts.        
	 The report, released in February, gave the Pakistani government 6 to 12 months before things went from bad to dangerous.        
	A specialist in guerrilla warfare, David Kilcullen, who advised General David H. Petraeus when General Petraeus was the American commander in Iraq, offered a more dire assessment. Pakistan could be facing internal collapse within six months, he said.        
	General Petraeus, in Congressional testimony last week, called the insurgency one that could take down the country, which is home to Qaida militants and has nuclear arms.         
	Even before the insurgency has been fully engaged, however, many Pakistanis have concluded that reaching an accommodation with the militants is preferable to fighting them. Some, including mid-ranking soldiers, choose to see the militants not as the enemy, but as fellow Muslims who are deserve greater sympathy than are the American aims.        
	It is problematic whether the backing of Zardari, and the Obamas administrations promise of $1.5 billion in aid for each of the next five years, can change the mood in the country, said a former interior minister, Aftab Ahmad Sherpao, who visited Washington last autumn.         
	There are questions, too, of whether the Obama offer of nearly $3 billion in counterinsurgency aid can quickly convert the Pakistani military from a force trained to fight India on the plains of Punjab into an outfit that can conquer the mountains of the tribal areas, where the militants operate.

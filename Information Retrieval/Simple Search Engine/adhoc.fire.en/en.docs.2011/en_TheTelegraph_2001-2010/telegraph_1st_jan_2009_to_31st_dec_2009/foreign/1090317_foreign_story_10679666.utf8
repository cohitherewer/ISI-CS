The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Incest father denies murder
                                                                                                               Incest father denies murder

	St Poelten (Austria), March 16 (Reuters): An Austrian man who fathered seven children with a daughter he held in a cellar for 24 years pleaded guilty to incest today but denied murdering their newborn son.        
	Wearing a mismatched grey suit, Josef Fritzl, 73, entered court in St Poelten, near Vienna, flanked by policemen and concealing his face behind a blue folder.        
	He later lowered the folder and, staring straight ahead, his back to the gallery, spoke softly, sometimes mumbling, in response to questions about personal details and his plea.        
	Fritzl pleaded partially guilty to rape  understood by reporters to mean he is contesting the way the charge is worded  and said he was guilty of depriving the children who were kept underground of their liberty. He pleaded innocent to a charge of enslaving his daughter Elisabeth for most of her life.         
	Prosecutors said Fritzl, who faces life in prison if convicted, was responsible for the death of a twin who died shortly after being born in the cellar in 1996. They said this was murder by neglect because Fritzl failed to seek help for the baby, whose body he burnt in a furnace.        
	He shut (Elisabeth) away in the cellar and made her totally dependent on him, forcing her into sexual acts and treating her as if she was his own property, his charge sheet read. A verdict is expected by Friday.         
	Fritzl, an engineer, built the soundproofed cellar with a reinforced door under his home in the provincial town of Amstetten.         
	In an opening statement, prosecutor Christiane Burkheiser said that in the first three years of Elisabeths incarceration there was no hot water, shower or heating. It was sometimes so hot that condensation dripped the down walls, she said. Burkheiser said among the worst aspects of Elisabeths ordeal was the uncertainty as to when he (Fritzl) would come down again, and rape before the eyes of the children.        
	Defence lawyer Rudolf Mayer said the charge of enslavement was inappropriate. He described how Fritzl brought up a second family and criticised his media portrayal as amonster.

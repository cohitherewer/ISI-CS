	Polanski jail touch    
	 London, Oct. 16 (PTI): Director Roman Polanski is putting the finishing touches to his latest film The Ghost from his jail cell to ensure it is completed in time for the Berlin film festival in February.      
	 Robert Harris, who co-wrote the screenplay of the film adapted from his novel of the same name, said Polanski was able to make his wishes known despite being locked up in Switzerland after being arrested on September 26.

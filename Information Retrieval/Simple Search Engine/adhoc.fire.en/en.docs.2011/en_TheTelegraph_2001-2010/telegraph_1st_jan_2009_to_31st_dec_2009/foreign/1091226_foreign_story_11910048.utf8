	London, Dec. 25: Britain has had its first official white Christmas for five years after snow fell in at least two parts of the country.        
	The Met Office said snow had been confirmed in Watnall, Nottinghamshire and Glasgow in the first few hours of December 25.        
	Temperatures were due to rise just above freezing during the day but the snow and ice across much of northern England was expected to remain on the ground. Further south, the snow and ice was replaced by rain and sleet.        
	Andrew Sibley, a forecaster from the Met Office said conditions were finally improving for many.                            THE DAILY TELEGRAPH

	JLo surgery    
	 London (PTI): Forty-year-old Jennifer Lopez has said that she will never opt for plastic surgery to maintain her good looks. The actress says she prefers ageing gracefully. I dont see myself having any plastic surgery. I dont know how I will feel when I am older. But I am more of a natural person and I believe in beauty not being an outside, physical thing.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Osamas son in Pak, say officials
                                                                                                               Osamas son in Pak, say officials

	Washington, Jan. 17: A son of Osama bin Laden who spent years under Iranian house arrest has left Iran and is now probably operating inside Pakistan, a senior American intelligence official said yesterday.         
	The son, Saad bin Laden, is one of a number of senior operatives of al Qaida detained inside Iran in recent years. American officials have long puzzled over the exact circumstances of their captivity, but they believe that Iran was holding the militants in part as a deterrent against a Qaida attack on Iranian soil.        
	Mike McConnell, the director of national intelligence, told reporters yesterday that Saad bin Laden was probably in Pakistan. He gave no details about whether bin Laden had escaped from custody, whether his departure reflected a deal between Iran and al Qaida or whether he was simply let go by Iranian officials.         
	McConnells announcement came as the treasury department imposed financial sanctions yesterday on Saad bin Laden and three other people believed to be Qaida operatives and thought to be in Iran.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Obamas on a Broadway date
                                                                                                               Obamas on a Broadway date
          JULIE BOSMAN                              
	New York, May 31: The Obamas escaped Washington yesterday in search of a quintessential New York evening  dinner and a Broadway show.        
	They found it at Blue Hill, a low-key Greenwich Village restaurant, and at the Belasco Theatre near Times Square for a performance of Joe Turners Come and Gone, the Tony-nominated a August Wilson play.         
	It was the Obamas first joint visit to the city as the First Couple. And even cooler-than-thou New York allowed itself a bit of excitement over their arrival.        
	I thought I was dreaming, said Kecia McCowen, a 45-year-old utility worker and student from Brooklyn; she bought tickets for the show three days ago, but found out that the Obamas would be there only after she arrived.        
	Along Avenue of the Americas, pedestrians stopped to wave, snap pictures and press against metal barricades as the Obamas motorcade zipped by.         
	Times Square was even more frenetic than usual, as throngs of pedestrians  including many tourists  lined several blocks waiting to catch a glimpse of the Obamas.         
	The presidential date began with a late-afternoon flight from Andrews Air Force Base, with Obama wearing a dark blue suit (no tie), and Michelle a black cocktail dress and a sleek updo, holding a turquoise clutch.         
	They landed at Kennedy International Airport at 4.45pm and after taking a quick helicopter ride to Lower Manhattan, the presidential motorcade snaked its way up to Blue Hill, a restaurant off Washington Square Park that specialises in cuisine from the Hudson Valley. (It sounded like the choice of Michelle, who favours local food.)         
	Hours before the show began, the Secret Service cordoned off the entire block of 44th Street between Avenue of the Americas and Broadway, where the Belasco is located.         
	Outside the theater, as the actors in the play began to trickle in, one of them, Chad L. Coleman, signed autographs and spoke with reporters, wearing a broad smile and an Obama cap.         
	There are no words for it, he said. I told people I got two in one: a Broadway debut and the President attending.        
	Ernie Hudson, one of the shows stars, insisted that the cast did not have butterflies.         
	Were all very excited, he said. You really cant do anything differently. You always do your best show possible.         
	The Obamas arrived at the theatre in a black stretch limousine just before 8pm, but lines at the metal detectors delayed the show more than 45 minutes.         
	When the Obamas walked down the aisle to take their seats, it was utter pandemonium, said Tim Johnson, who was in the audience, and described a scene of shouting, clapping and a long standing ovation.         
	Meryl Streep sat a few rows in front of the Obamas, said Johnson, 52. No one seemed to notice, he said.         
	About 11.30pm, the Obamas emerged from the theatre.        
	While the Obamas visit to New York was considered private, there was some very public criticism of the trip. In a press release that was issued yesterday afternoon with the headline Putting on a Show, The Republican National Committee suggested in a press release yesterday that the outing was inappropriate and that Obama was out of touch, especially given the looming bankruptcy of General Motors.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Pak amnesty pleas in court
                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      Pak amnesty pleas in court
                            
	Islamabad, Dec. 1 (AP): Pakistans Supreme Court today said it had taken up petitions challenging the amnesty from graft charges granted to more than 8,000 people, including President Asif Ali Zardari.        
	Todays statement says all concerned parties have been notified that the court will start proceedings into the petitions on December 7.         
	Zardari is among the beneficiaries of the amnesty granted by his predecessor Pervez Musharraf.         
	The deal paved the way for Benazir Bhutto to return home from self-exile and take part in politic.        
	Zardari enjoys immunity as President but legal experts say the court could decide to revoke that privilege.

	Washington, Jan. 19: Yesterday, President-elect Barack Obama got Elizabeth Ross, a 57-year-old African-American woman from Lorman, Mississippi, to see Bruce Springsteen in concert.        
	Clad in a floor-length black mink coat, matching hat and stunningly manicured nails, Ross  and hundreds of thousands of others, their faces bright with both chill and expectation  converged on the Lincoln Memorial to kick off Americas three-day inauguration party.        
	Crammed together as far as the eye could see  from the seated statue of Abraham Lincoln all the way past the reflecting pool and up the hill to the Washington Monument  they danced, sang, shivered, cheered, hooted and hollered for the black man who will be Americas next President, in what seemed a cross between the Reverend Martin Luther King Jr.s March on Washington and Woodstock.         
	 Obama, looking into the mass of faces raised to him, seemed to feed off the crowd. The text of his speech was sombre, noting the economic crisis and the two wars, and calling for a new spirit of sacrifice to overcome them. But his voice was upbeat.         
	I stand here today as hopeful as ever that the United States of America will endure, the President-elect said. What gives me that hope is what I see when I look out across this Mall.        
	Looking back at him from across the Mall was an ocean of expectations, as people from Napa, California, to Detroit to Orlando, Florida, clad in Obama T-shirts, hats, jewellery and even face paint, hugged one another and swayed to the music from the array of heavy hitters from the entertainment world who were performing. My father would have loved to have seen this, Ross said, gazing raptly at the stage.         
	In front of her, Springsteen was singing The Rising, the song he wrote after the September 11, 2001, attacks that pays homage to the firefighters who lost their lives as they climbed the stairs of the burning Twin Towers.         
	Ross had never seen Springsteen in concert. In fact, the last concert she went to was by the Manhattans in Atlanta in 2001. And yet, there she was, along with three girlfriends  all in floor-length minks  huddled in the cold, tapping their feet to the beat. Four middle-age, African-American women, talking about the Selma-to-Montgomery march in 1965, about King, about the civil rights movement  and listening to Bruce.         
	Im so out of my comfort zone out here in the cold, said Delphine Straughn-Tupper, one of Rosss friends. But there was no way I was going to miss this.         
	For Obama and his aides, finding a way to temper and manage all that emotion and optimism may be their biggest challenge in the next three days. The incoming White House press secretary, Robert Gibbs, was on Fox News Sunday trying to remind everyone that the country will still be in a recession on January 21.         
	We did not get into the situation overnight, Gibbs said. The problems and the challenges that our country face didnt happen all last week. Its going to take us some time.

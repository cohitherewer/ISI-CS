	Seattle, Nov. 17: Microsoft Corp. co-founder and billionaire investor Paul Allen has been diagnosed with non-Hodgkins lymphoma and is undergoing chemotherapy.        
	In a memo sent to employees, Jody Allen, Paul Allens sister and the CEO of his investment firm Vulcan Inc., said the 56-year-old received the diagnosis early this month. According to the memo, Paul Allen has diffuse large B-cell lymphoma.        
	Allen battled another form of immune system cancer, Hodgkins lymphoma, more than 20 years ago and survived. Allen is optimistic he can beat this, too.

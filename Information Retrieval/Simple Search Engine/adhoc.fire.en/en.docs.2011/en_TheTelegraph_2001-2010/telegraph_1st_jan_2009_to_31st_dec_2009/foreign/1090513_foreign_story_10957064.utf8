The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | India flu options
                                                                                                               India flu options
          GS MUDUR                              
	New Delhi, May 12: The government today began a process to explore options for domestic production of a vaccine against the new H1N1 influenza that has spread to 30 countries and has revealed its potential to sweep the world as a pandemic.         
	 In a closed-door meeting, medical researchers, government officials, and industry executives discussed whether local pharmaceutical industries could initiate a quick production effort aimed at releasing a vaccine in the next six to eight months.         
	 While Indian health authorities have not detected the new virus in the country yet, the decision to consider options for local production is part of a preparedness effort, a senior scientist at the meeting told The Telegraph. If this outbreak spreads, and the world really sees a pandemic, well need our own vaccine. Were not going to get the kind of supply we need from anywhere else, the scientist said.         
	 At least four companies  Bharat Biotech, Panacea Biotec, Serum Institute of India, and Sanofi  sent representatives to the brainstorming session which was organised by the Indian Council of Medical Research, meeting participants said.         
	 A source said the companies have been asked to submit proposals about how they could contribute to a domestic H1N1 flu vaccine production effort and what they would expect from the government. A government decision on investing in the flu vaccine effort is expected to emerge soon, the source said.         
	 But industry sources said India is in some ways handicapped and it is uncertain whether a domestic vaccine would be available in large quantities that might be required for a country the size of India by December 2009.         
	 The US Centers for Disease Control has initiated a vaccine production effort, injecting the H1N1 virus into eggs to produce vast quantities of the virus needed to make the vaccine. The US estimates the process could take about six months.         
	 But unlike US industry, we dont have a ready platform to roll out a flu vaccine, a senior industry executive present at the meeting told The Telegraph . The flu virus needs to be injected into pathogen-free eggs [eggs free of infection] where it multiplies into large numbers. Large quantities of the virus are then harvested from each egg, but a single egg leads to one or two doses of a vaccine, the executive said.         
	 Well need the infrastructure to handle millions of pathogen-free eggs to produce millions of doses of the vaccine, the official said. The US industry has had such an infrastructure for years for the annual production of vaccines against seasonal flu.         
	 Local industry has had little incentive to work towards a flu vaccine. The US market for seasonal flu vaccines is nearly 180 million doses, while Europe consumes about 150 million doses, an industry source said. Even China uses up 25 million doses of the seasonal flu vaccine, but the market in India is only 200,000 doses  sold through the private sector.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | American official quits over Afghan war
                                                                                                               American official quits over Afghan war

	Washington, Oct. 27: When Matthew Hoh joined the foreign service this year, he was exactly the kind of smart civil-military hybrid the administration was looking for to help expand its development efforts in Afghanistan.        
	A former Marine Corps captain with combat experience in Iraq, Hoh had also served in uniform at the Pentagon, as a civilian in Iraq and at the state department.         
	But last month, in a move that has sent ripples all the way to the White House, Hoh, 36, became the first US official known to resign in protest over the Afghan war, which he had believed simply fuelled the insurgency.        
	I have lost understanding of and confidence in the strategic purposes of the United Statess presence in Afghanistan, he wrote on September 10 in a four-page letter to the departments head of personnel. I have doubts and reservations about our current strategy and planned future strategy, but my resignation is based not upon how we are pursuing this war, but why and to what end.        
	The reaction to Hohs letter was immediate. Senior US officials, concerned that they would lose an outstanding officer and perhaps gain a prominent critic, appealed to him to stay.        
	US ambassador Karl W. Eikenberry brought him to Kabul and offered him a job on his senior embassy staff. Hoh declined. We took his letter very seriously, because he was a good officer, Holbrooke said. We all thought that given how serious his letter was, how much commitment there was, and his prior track record, we should pay close attention to him.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | US lost record jobs in January
                                                                                                               US lost record jobs in January

	Washington, Feb. 6: The US lost almost 600,000 jobs last month and the unemployment rate rose to 7.6 per cent, its highest level in more than 16 years, the labour department said today.        
	It was the biggest monthly job loss since the economy tipped into a recession more than a year ago, and it was even worse than most forecasters had been predicting.        
	In addition, the government revised the estimates for previous months to include another 400,000 job losses. For December, the government revised the job loss to 577,000 compared with an initial reading of 524,000. Overall, it said, the nation has lost 3.6 million jobs since it slipped into a recession in December 2007.        
	Businesses are panicked and fighting for survival and slashing their payrolls, said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moodys Economy.com. I think were trapped in a very adverse, self-reinforcing cycle.         
	As in previous months, employers in January slashed their payrolls in almost every industry except health care. Manufacturers eliminated 207,000 jobs, more than in any year since 1982. The construction industry eliminated 111,000 jobs. And retailers, who were wrapping up their worst holiday shopping season in years, eliminated 45,000 jobs.        
	One modest exception to the bad news was in workers wages, which have thus far not reflected the dramatic plunge in employment.         
	Overall, the new data reinforced the impression of an economy that has become increasingly trapped a vicious circle slumping consumer demand, falling business investment, rising unemployment and mounting losses in the banking system.

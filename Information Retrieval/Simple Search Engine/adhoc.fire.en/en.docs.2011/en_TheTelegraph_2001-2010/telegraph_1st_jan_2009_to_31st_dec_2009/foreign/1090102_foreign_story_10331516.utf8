	Bangkok, Jan. 1 (AP): A fire raced through a nightclub packed with hundreds of well-heeled New Years revellers early today, killing at least 61 people as they stampeded to escape the raging flames.        
	More than 200 were injured, including 35 foreigners.        
	A number of foreigners were among the casualties at the Santika Club, which attracted an affluent crowd of young Thais and foreigners.        
	Hospital rosters showed 13 foreigners were treated for injuries and one man, a Singaporean national, had died. The department of foreign affairs and trade in Australia said three of its nationals were also among the hospitalised.        
	The cause of the fire was under investigation but several witnesses said a fireworks display during the New Years countdown ignited the blaze.        
	Everybody was pushing against each other trying to get out to the front door as quickly as possible. I saw people, particularly young girls, being pushed away and crushed underneath as others were stomping on them trying to get out, said Sompong Tritaweelap, who lives in an apartment behind the nightclub.        
	Victims died from burns, smoke inhalation and injuries during the stampede from the club, which had only one door for the public, police major general Chokchai Deeprasertwit said. Firefighters said a door at the rear was known only to the staff.        
	Video footage showed bloodied, bruised and burned victims being dragged out of the burning club or managing to run through the door or shattered windows.         
	A joint roster provided by Bangkok hospitals showed three Japanese, two South Koreans and one Singaporean were treated while another Singaporean identified as Teo Sze Siong had died. The names of seven other foreigners were posted, but no nationalities were given.

                              Hilton: Gordon dilemma                            
	London, Jan. 28: Paris Hilton, in London to launch her new television show, has said she thought Gordon Ramsay was the Prime Minister of Great Britain.         
	The hotel heiress revealed that, although she said her time in the country taught her slang terms such as minger and fit, she failed to answer correctly when asked to name the British Prime Minister, claiming she thought it was Gordon Ramsay who in actuality was a chef, television personality and restaurateur.         
	Instead she said: I had lunch at his restaurant yesterday  Gordon Ramsay.         
	The 27-year-old said the aim of ITV2 programme Paris Hiltons British Best Friend was to find someone who had a fun personality, someone who was real, someone who looked like they could be a lot of fun, someone I could trust. Someone who enjoys life.

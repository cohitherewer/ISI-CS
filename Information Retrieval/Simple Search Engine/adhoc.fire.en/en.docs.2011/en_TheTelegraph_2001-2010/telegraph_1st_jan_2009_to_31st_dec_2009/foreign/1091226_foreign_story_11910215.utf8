The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | China rebel jailed for 11 years

          ANDREW JACOBS                          Liu Xiaobo: Harsh                                  
	Beijing, Dec. 25: In an unequivocal rebuke to those pursuing political reforms, a Chinese court today sentenced one of the countrys best-known dissidents to 11 years in prison for subversion.        
	Liu Xiaobo, 53, a former literature professor and a dogged critic of Chinas single-party political system, was detained in December 2008 after he helped draft a petition known as Charter 08 that demanded the right to free speech, open elections and the rule of law.        
	Parts of the 11-page verdict, largely a restatement of his indictment, were read out this morning at the Beijing No. 1 Intermediate Peoples Court, said Lius lawyer, Shang Baojun. In addition to his prison term, Liu will be deprived of his political rights for an additional two years, a penalty that will bar him from writing or speaking out on a wide range of issues. We are just extremely disappointed, said Shang, who added that Liu intends to appeal the verdict.        
	Gregory May, first secretary with the US embassy, who stood outside the courthouse this morning, called on the authorities to immediately release Liu. Persecution of individuals for the peaceful expression of political views is inconsistent with internationally recognised norms of human rights, he said.        
	Although Liu had faced a maximum sentence of 15 years, legal experts and human rights advocates said the punishment was very harsh and was meant to send a message to others who might agitate for political reform.        
	Nicholas Bequelin, a senior Asia researcher for Human Rights Watch in Hong Kong, described Liu as a sacrificial lamb and said that the communist party leadership was trying to intimidate its critics. The rights group called the trial a travesty of justice.        
	 Bequelin and others said Lius prosecution for violating rights enshrined in Chinas Constitution suggested a political hardening, a trend that began before the 2008 Beijing Olympics.

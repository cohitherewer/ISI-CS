The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Israel warning
                                                                                                               Israel warning
                            
	Gaza City, Jan. 10 (AP): Israeli forces today pounded dozens of targets in the Gaza Strip and dropped leaflets warning of an escalation in attacks, as southern Israel came under more Palestinian rocket fire.         
	Egypt hosted talks aimed at seeking an end to the violence. The heavy fighting  and the Israeli threat to launch a new stage in a two-week-old offensive that has killed more than 800 Palestinians  came in defiance of international calls for a halt in fighting. In the days bloodiest incident, an Israeli tank shell killed nine people in a garden outside a home in the northern Gaza town of Jebaliya. Separately, a woman was killed by an Israeli airstrike in the southern town of Rafah.        
	The Israeli military said more than 15 militants were killed in overnight fighting. Its aircraft attacked more than 40 targets throughout Gaza, striking 10 rocket-launching sites, weapons-storage facilities, smuggling tunnels, an anti-aircraft missile launcher and gunmen. Flames and smoke rose over Gaza City, and Israeli planes dropped leaflets in the territory announcing a new phase in the military operation. The IDF (Israeli Defence Forces) will escalate the operation in the Gaza Strip, the leaflets said in Arabic.         
	The IDF is not working against the people of Gaza but against Hamas and the terrorists only. Stay safe by following our orders. The leaflets urged Gaza residents not to help Hamas and to stay away from its members.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Israel skirts thorny issues in speech
                                                                                                               Israel skirts thorny issues in speech
                            
	Jerusalem, June 4 (AP): Israel said it hoped Barack Obamas speech to the Muslim world today would help usher in a new period of reconciliation in West Asia, but carefully brushed over key differences with the US highlighted in the historic address.        
	A government statement welcomed Obamas plea for peace. But it skirted any reference to Obamas calls for a settlement freeze in the West Bank and the creation of an independent Palestinian state  demands that Israels hawkish Prime Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, continues to reject.        
	We share President Obamas hope that the American effort heralds the beginning of a new era that will bring about an end to the conflict and lead to Arab recognition of Israel as the homeland of the Jewish people, living in peace and security in the Middle East, the statement said.        
	Israelis had mixed reactions to Obamas speech.        
	One government official said the speech could have been worse for Israel, while a spokesperson called Obama naive and out of touch with reality. Israels dovish President, Nobel peace laureate Shimon Peres, said it was full of vision.        
	Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas welcomed Obamas words. It shows there is a new and different American policy toward the Palestinian issue, said his spokesperson, Nabil Abu Rdeneh.         
	Israel, the country most on edge about Obamas outreach to Muslims, tried to put a positive face on todays events. Israels hawkish government clearly did not want to exacerbate already palpable tensions with the liberal US President.        
	All in all, its not bad. I dont think theres anything we disagree with here, said Danny Seaman, the director of Israels government press office.

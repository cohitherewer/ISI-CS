	Cairo, June 29: As officials began a limited recount of Irans disputed presidential ballot today, authorities in Tehran said they had extended by five days their deadline to investigate Opposition claims of electoral fraud.         
	The move could postpone the final certification of the ballot, which Iranian leaders insist was fair.        
	The Guardian Council begun a recount of a purportedly random 10 per cent of the vote  a move seen by political analysts as unlikely to change the outcome.        
	The Opposition has called for the vote to be annulled so that a new election can be held, but the authorities have rejected the demand. According to the official tally released a day after the election, President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad won the contest with almost two-thirds of the 40 million votes cast.        
	State television said today that recounting had begun in Tehrans 22 electoral districts and in some provinces. The official Irna news agency said that in one district, Ahmadinejad won even more votes than in the first official count. The Guardian Council said Opposition candidates who lost in the official tally had refused to send monitors to the recount, apparently to avoid any impression that they were endorsing or legitimising the process.        
	The developments came after protesters returned yesterday to Tehrans streets, with the police beating and firing tear gas at several thousand demonstrators who joined a demonstration at a mosque in support of the defeated presidential candidate, Mir Hossein Moussavi.         
	Iran also said today that it had freed five of nine Iranian employees of the British embassy in Tehran, detained during the weekend and accused of fomenting unrest after the June 12 vote, in which Moussavi was placed second to President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad.

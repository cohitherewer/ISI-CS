The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Israel faces political gridlock
                                                                                                               Israel faces political gridlock
                                Livni, Netanyahu                           
	Jerusalem, Feb. 11 (Reuters): Israel headed for political gridlock today after its election produced rival winners.        
	Analysts said the country was as split as the Palestinians. Centrist Tzipi Livnis Kadima party won the most votes but had little chance of building enough support for a coalition.        
	 Right-winger Benjamin Netanyahu can get the support, but analysts said the likely coalition would prove dysfunctional.

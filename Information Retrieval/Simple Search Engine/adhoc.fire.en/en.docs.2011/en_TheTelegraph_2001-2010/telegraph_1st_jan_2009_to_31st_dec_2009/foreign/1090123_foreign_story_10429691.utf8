The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Kennedy withdraws Senate bid
                                                                                                               Kennedy withdraws Senate bid
                              Caroline Kennedy                            
	New York, Jan. 22 (Reuters): Caroline Kennedy, the daughter of slain President John F. Kennedy, today withdrew her bid to fill the Senate seat for New York vacated by Hillary Clinton. Kennedy cited personal reasons in a statement.        
	The decision came after her uncle, Senator Ted Kennedy, with whom she is said to be close, suffered a seizure on Tuesday during a luncheon in Washington honouring newly sworn-in President Barack Obama. The 76-year-old senator from Massachusetts, who is fighting brain cancer, was released from the hospital a day later.        
	Kennedy had been considered a front-runner for the seat once held by her uncle Robert Kennedy. I informed Governor Paterson today that for personal reasons I am withdrawing my name from consideration for the United States Senate, Kennedy said in the statement issued by her spokesman. The move leaves New York attorney general Andrew Cuomo as the top candidate to succeed Clinton.

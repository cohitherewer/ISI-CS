The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Wall St fills Obama coffer
                                                                                                               Wall St fills Obama coffer
                                Indonesian photographer Ilham Anas (picture above) won rsquo;t be at President-elect Barack Obama rsquo;s inauguration on Tuesday. Instead he rsquo;ll be starring as an Obama look-alike on Indonesian TV.     Anas, 34, who from some angles bears a resemblance to the President-elect, shot to fame in Jakarta after Obama, 47, won the election and is now earning income as an Obama double. Obama had lived in Jakarta for four years after his American mother, Ann Dunham, married Indonesian Lolo Soetoro following the end of her marriage to Obama rsquo;s Kenyan father.

	Washington, Jan. 18 (Agencies): Wall Street may be bruised and battered, but it still donated more money than any other US industry to President-elect Barack Obamas inaugural festivities on Tuesday, a study has found.        
	The Center for Responsive Politics said executives of finance, insurance and real estate companies and their family members gave $7.1 million to Obamas inaugural committee.        
	Top donors from the world of high finance included George Soros, Ronald Perelman and David Shaw, the centre said.        
	As an organisation, Vikram Pandit-led Citi, which has decided to split itself into two separate businesses, has contributed $60,000, the study said.        
	Bankers and hedge fund managers will mingle with Hollywood stars and Silicon Valley high-technology titans at the swearing-in ceremony for the 44th President.        
	Special access and tickets are reportedly available to those who contributed $50,000 to the inaugural committee or who helped bundle larger sums from multiple individual donors, the centre said.        
	The committee refused to accept money from corporations, registered lobbyists, unions or political action committees.        
	Entertainers such as Halle Berry, Samuel Jackson and Sharon Stone donated heavily, as did behind-the-camera moguls including Steven Spielberg and George Lucas, the center said, citing data downloaded from the presidential inaugural committees website.        
	While Americans are hoping for real change in Washington, many deep-pocketed donors are hoping money still buys them access and influence, said Sheila Krumholz, executive director of the money-in-politics watchdog group.        
	If history is any guide, these wealthy individuals, as well as the corporations and industries they represent, may more than recoup their investment in Obama through presidential appointments, favourable legislation and government contracts, Krumholz said.        
	People with Wall Street ties  118 of them  gave $3.6 million; lawyers gave $2.5 million; and donors from the TV, movie and music businesses gave $1.7 million, the centre said.        
	Obamas inaugural ceremony is expected to be the most expensive of all Presidents and is estimated to cost about $150 million.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Home Alone creator dies on a stroll
                                                                                                               Home Alone creator dies on a stroll
                              John Hughes                            
	Los Angeles, Aug. 7 (Reuters): Filmmaker John Hughes, who made some of the most memorable teen comedies of the 1980s and turned Macaulay Culkin into a major star, died suddenly of a heart attack in New York yesterday. He was 59.        
	Hughes, who had largely turned his back on Hollywood in the past decade to become a farmer in the Midwestern state of Illinois, collapsed while strolling in Manhattan, where he was visiting friends.        
	His films, such as Sixteen Candles and The Breakfast Club are considered standard-bearers of the teen genre, exploring American adolescent behaviour with warmth and affection. He supplied his awkward characters with natural dialogue, allowing audiences to empathise with their travails.        
	In 1990, Hughes struck gold by writing and producing Home Alone, in which Culkin played an 8-year-old left to fend for himself against hapless burglars.         
	The film grossed almost $500 million worldwide.

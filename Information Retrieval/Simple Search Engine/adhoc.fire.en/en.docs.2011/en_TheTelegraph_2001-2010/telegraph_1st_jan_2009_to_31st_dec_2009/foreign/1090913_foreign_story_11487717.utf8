          MATTHEW MOORE                          The Tower Bridge                                  
	London, Sept. 12: Some of Britains most famous bridges are engaged in a war of words on Twitter, the micro-blogging website.        
	Tower Bridge is being teased relentlessly by its neighbour London Bridge for the tedium and pomposity of its updates, while the Severn Bridge and Bristols Clifton Suspension Bridge have fallen out over tolls.        
	The surreal online squabbles began shortly after the managers of Tower Bridge set up an official Twitter account to alert Londoners every time it is raised to let ships pass.        
	Its repetitive updates (I am opening for the SB Lady Daphne, which is passing upstream, I am closing after the SB Lady Daphne has passed upstream) were ripe for parody, and soon someone set up a rival account under the name Im London Bridge.        
	The bridges first words on the site made its intention clear: Certain other bridges in London think theyre so cool getting a Twitter account. Well theyre not. Im the coolest bridge in London. Official. London Bridges witticisms have attracted a decent audience  it has 1,400 followers, compared to Tower Bridges 1,900.                    THE DAILY TELEGRAPH

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Anti-tobacco Obama still smokes
                                                                                                               Anti-tobacco Obama still smokes
                            
	Washington, June 23 (Reuters): President Barack Obama may have just made life more difficult for cigarette makers, but he is not above sneaking a smoke every now and again.        
	Obama, who has publicly struggled to quit smoking, said he still hasnt completely kicked the habit even after signing a law this week that will likely set tough new rules for the tobacco industry.        
	As a former smoker I constantly struggle with it. Have I fallen off the wagon sometimes? Yes. Am I a daily smoker, a constant smoker? No, Obama said at a news conference.        
	I dont do it in front of my kids, I dont do it in front of my family. I would say that I am 95 per cent cured, but there are times where I mess up, he said. The new law gives the US Food and Drug Administration the power to strictly limit the manufacturing and marketing of tobacco products.

	New York, Feb. 18 (AP): What kind of person goes coatless on a frigid February night?        
	Victoria Beckham, thats who.        
	 Beckham, fashionista and wife of David Beckham, sacrificed warmth for glamour while posing on the outdoor red carpet that led to her glitzy destination: the new Giorgio Armani store on 5th Avenue, where Armani held an oh-so-exclusive party.        
	Braving near zero degree Celsius weather, Beckham stopped to talk to the media, showing some skin  and lots of leg  in a silvery sequined one-strap dress and heels.

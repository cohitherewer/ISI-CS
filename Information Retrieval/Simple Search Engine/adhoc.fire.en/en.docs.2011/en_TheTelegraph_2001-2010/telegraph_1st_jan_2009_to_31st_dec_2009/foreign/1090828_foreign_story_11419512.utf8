                              Watts: Horrified                            
	London, Aug. 27 (PTI): Actress Naomi Watts was horrified after she saw lover Liev Schreiber portray a cross-dresser in his latest film Taking Woodstock.        
	The Inglourious Basterds actor had to shave his body hair and wear ladies clothing to play an ex-Marine transvestite in the Ang Lee film.        
	His transformation did not go down well with Watts, his girlfriend and mother of his two children. She was horrified! It flipped her out. She was in shock. Then she started to crack jokes, the 44-year-old actor said about Wattss reaction.         
	Schreiber said that he himself struggled to accept his new image while dressing up as a woman. It was exhilaratingly humiliating. But I completely became giddy in a strange way the moment I put on the dress. I thought to myself: I wish my belly was flatter. Lets face it, I dont look great in a dress.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Taliban recapture key town
                                                                                                               Taliban recapture key town
                            
	Dera Ismail Khan (Pakistan), Oct. 20 (Reuters): Taliban militants attacked Pakistani forces and recaptured a strategic town today, officials said.        
	The government made an immediate link between the university attack and an offensive against the Taliban, with interior minister Rehman Malik saying all roads are leading towards South Waziristan.        
	The army yesterday captured the small town of Kotkai, the birthplace of Pakistani Taliban chief Hakimullah Mehsud, on the approach to an insurgent base in south Waziristan. However, militants struck back today to re-capture it, security officials said.        
	An intelligence official said jets bombed Taliban positions near Kotkai after the militant counter-attack.

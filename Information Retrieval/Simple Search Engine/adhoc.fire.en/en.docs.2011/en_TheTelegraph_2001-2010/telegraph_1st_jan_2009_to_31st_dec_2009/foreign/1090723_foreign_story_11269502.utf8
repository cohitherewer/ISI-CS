The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | No charges against Harvard scholar
                                                                                                               No charges against Harvard scholar
                            
	Boston, July 22 (Reuters): Authorities in Cambridge, Massachusetts yesterday dropped disorderly conduct charges against a preeminent black scholar stemming from an incident that drew fresh attention to police treatment of minorities in the US.        
	Harvard University professor Henry Louis Gates was arrested at his home in the Boston suburb of Cambridge last Thursday by a white police officer after a woman called police to report that a man was trying to force his way into the house.        
	Gates, 58, had merely experienced difficulty opening his own front door after returning from a trip to China, according to his lawyer. But police said Gates exhibitedloud and tumultuous behaviour, including accusing police of racism.        
	A statement on the Cambridge police departments website said: The City of Cambridge, the Cambridge Police Department, and Prof. Gates acknowledge that the incident of July 16, 2009 was regrettable and unfortunate.        
	This incident should not be viewed as one that demeans the character and reputation of Prof. Gates or the character of the Cambridge Police Department, the statement said, adding that the charges were dropped.        
	Gates is the director of Harvards W.E.B. Du Bois Institute for African amp; African American Research and is one of the most prominent black scholars in the US.        
	The incident renewed a debate over racial profiling and whether police in the US treat blacks and other minorities differently than whites  even after the election of the first black President in Barack Obama.        
	Im outraged that this could happen to me in my own home but Im outraged that it could happen to any individual, Gates said.

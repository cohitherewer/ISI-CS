The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Gmail hit by 2-hr outage
                                                                                                               Gmail hit by 2-hr outage
  - Majority of users affected                                
	San Francisco, Sept. 2 (AP): Google Incs Gmail service was knocked offline today in an outage that the company said affected a majority of its millions of email users.        
	It included consumers who get Gmail for free and businesses that pay for a version for their employees.        
	The disruption, which lasted under two hours, was a reminder of the growing dependence on Googles technology. The free version of Gmail is the worlds third most-popular email programme with some 149 million users worldwide in June, ranking behind the free email services offered by Microsoft Corp. and Yahoo Inc., according to data from www.comscore.com.        
	Todays disruption led tens of millions of Gmail users to get an Unable to reach Gmailerror message as their computers tried repeatedly to reconnect to the service. Google said it had taken some of Gmails servers offline for routine maintenance, and underestimated the load that would place on other computers responsible for directing traffic to the appropriate Gmail servers.        
	Google said it was alerted to the failures within seconds. It said it has added capacity and made other changes to prevent similar incidents in the future. A separate outage yesterday had wiped out email to a small subset of users.        
	Though occasional disruptions are common, widespread outages involving Googles services are rare. They are becoming a bigger threat to Google as it tries to sell more of its services to businesses. Businesses are increasingly leaning on Googles services because they are delivered over the Internet instead of being managed in-house. That can save companies money and buy them more storage than they could otherwise afford.

	Stockholm, Dec. 7: A Stockholm department store has removed a new line of North Korean-made designer jeans from its shelves, saying it wanted to avoid courting controversy with ties with the communist nation.        
	The PUB department stores management had not been informed that the jeans would be carried in its space, and it pulled the plug when it became aware of it, Rene Stephansen, the stores director, said on Saturday. For us, this is not a question of Noko Jeans  this is a question about a political issue that PUB doesnt want to be associated with, he said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | US flight delays
                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      US flight delays
                            
	Atlanta, Nov. 19 (AP): A problem with the system that collects airlines flight plans caused widespread flight cancellations and delays across the US today.         
	It was the second time in 15 months that a glitch in the flight plan system caused delays.         
	Federal Aviation Administration spokeswoman Kathleen Bergen said she does not know how many flights are being affected or when the problem will be resolved. Another FAA spokesperson, Paul Takemoto, said the problem started between 1015 and 1030 GMT. The outage is affecting mostly flight plans but also traffic management, such as ground stops and ground delays, he said.        
	Regarding flight plans, airplane dispatchers are now sending plans to controllers and controllers in turn are entering them into computers manually, he said. Its slowing everything down. We dont know yet what the impact on delays will be, Takemoto said.        
	An AirTran Airways spokesman said theres no danger to flights in the air, and flights are still taking off and landing. However, spokesman Christopher White said flight plans must now be loaded manually because of a malfunction with the automated system.

	Dhaka, Nov. 28 (Reuters): Rescuers have retrieved 32 bodies, including at least 12 children, and are searching for scores of people missing after an overcrowded ferry sank in a river along the Bangladesh coast, police and witnesses said today.        
	They said the ferry M.V. Coco-4 was sailing to the coastal town of Bhola, some 300km from Dhaka, last night with around 1,500 people on board  about three times the number it was registered to carry. The death toll late yesterday had been put at five.        
	Many of those on board were going home to celebrate the Id-ul-Zuha festival today.        
	Media at the scene reported the ferry started taking in water after it hit a raised section of the river bed in heavy fog. Most of those on board swam to safety but up to 80 may still be missing, one survivor said.         
	The ferry was listed with a capacity to carry about 450 people. People were trying desperately to reach home before the Id prayers this morning.

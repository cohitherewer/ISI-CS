The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Fidel hails noble intentions
                                                                                                               Fidel hails noble intentions
                              Castro                            
	Havana, Jan, 22 (Reuters): Fidel Castro praised President Barack Obama yesterday for his noble intentions but said in his first opinion column in five weeks that the new American leader had many questions to answer.        
	Castros prolonged silence after months of prolific column writing had contributed to speculation that the ailing 82-year-old was on his death bed.        
	He did not disclose the reason that he had not written a column, or reflection as he calls them, since December 15, after averaging nine a month in 2008.        
	Castro spoke of his admiration for Obama, who took office on Tuesday, replacing George W. Bush. I expressed that personally I had not the least doubt of the honesty with which Obama expressed his ideas.

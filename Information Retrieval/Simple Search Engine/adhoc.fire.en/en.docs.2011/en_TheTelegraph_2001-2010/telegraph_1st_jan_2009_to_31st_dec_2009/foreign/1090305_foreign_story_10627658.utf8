The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Ominous theories swirl in Dhaka 
                                                                                                               Ominous theories swirl in Dhaka 
          NISHIT DHOLABHAI                              
	New Delhi, March 4: Intelligence inputs from Bangladesh today warned that Prime Minister Sheikh Hasinas life could be in danger amid indications of external help to elements in Indias mutiny-scarred neighbour in orchestrating a coup.        
	Sources spoke of a West Asian link to the alleged conspiracy but did not specify.        
	Hasina, too, has reportedly warned her country of more sabotage from the conspirators behind the BDR mutiny last month that left dozens of army officers dead.        
	Sources in Delhi said Indias intelligence agency RAW had come to know of separate meetings of officials of Pakistans spy wing ISI and the Directorate-General of Forces Intelligence (DGFI) of Bangladesh with members of the hardline Jamaat-e-Islami and the opposition BNP, both seen as pro-Pakistan.        
	Hasina, the sources told The Telegraph, faces a threat to her life from elements dissatisfied with her for letting the BDR get away with a general amnesty.         
	The reports from Bangladesh, still being verified, indicated that a section of the Jamaat along with elements in the army and the BNP was plotting to kill the Awami League leader. Sheikh Hasina is in serious trouble as the situation is very volatile at the moment, government sources here said.         
	The threat perception includes attempts by gunmen on Hasinas motorcade or during political meetings.        
	Hasinas decision to change the name and structure of the BDR has also not gone down well with the pro-Jamaat section of the army, the sources said. They said the re-christened BDR would include personnel from police and the army.         
	Hasinas Awami League government began paying disbursement to BDR personnel, sources reported from Tripura today. The sources also said that at some places, BDR officers were asked to take charge as battalion commanders, another move unlikely to go down well with the army.        
	On this side of the border, the BSF has a different kind of problem to tackle.         
	The new BDR chief, Moinul Islam, is a brigadier general, a rank on a par with a BSF inspector general or deputy inspector general. So communication between the BSF boss, who holds the rank of director general, and the BDR chief faces a protocol hurdle.         
	We have, however, decided to go ahead and begin communications by writing them a letter expressing solidarity and continuation of friendly ties, said a BSF source.        
	Mutiny video        
	Investigators probing the BDR mutiny said they had clues that outsiders in uniform took part in the massacre of army officers.         
	BDR chief Islam told Daily Star that footage of the massacre inside the BDR headquarters showed some unknown people wearing BDR uniforms.

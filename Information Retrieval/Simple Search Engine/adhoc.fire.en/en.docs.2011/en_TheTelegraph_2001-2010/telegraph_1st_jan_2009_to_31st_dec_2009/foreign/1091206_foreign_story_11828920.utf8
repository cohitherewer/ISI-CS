The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Virginia Tech staff alerted family first
                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      Virginia Tech staff alerted family first
          IAN URBINA                          Seung-Hui Cho in the video sent to NBC before the Virginia Tech shooting                                  
	Richmond (Virginia), Dec. 5: During the worst campus shooting spree in American history, Virginia Tech officials locked down some administrative offices and warned their own families more than an hour and a half before the rest of the campus was alerted, according to revisions made in the states official report on the rampage.        
	The revelations come more than two-and-a-half years after the gunman, Seung-Hui Cho, went on a rampage that killed 32 students and faculty members before taking his own life, and only 10 days before oral arguments are to begin in lawsuits challenging the universitys handling of the matter.        
	Two Indians, Prof. G.V. Loganathan and student Minal Hiralal, died in the massacre.        
	They do not change the original thrust of the report  that university officials could have saved lives by notifying students and faculty members earlier about the killings on campus. But they provide a more detailed picture of the mistakes made by university officials in handling the emergency.         
	The report, for instance, indicates that students who were initially locked down at West Ambler Johnston residence hall, where the first two victims were killed, were later released from the building by the police and allowed to attend their 9am classes. Two of those students then went to class in Norris Hall, where they were killed by the gunman.        
	University officials failed to contact the family of the gunmans first victim, Emily Hilscher, until after she had died, even though Hilscher survived for three hours and was taken to two hospitals before her death. But the revised report  produced at the insistence of parents of the victims and totalling more than 200 pages  made no new recommendations.        
	The timeline in the new report suggests that officials were reluctant to spread the news about the first two shootings. For example, at 8:45am on the day of the shootings, the report says: A policy group member emails a Richmond colleague saying one student is dead and another critically wounded. Gunman on the loose, he says, adding, This is not releasable yet.        
	At 8:49, the report adds: The same policy group member reminds his Richmond colleague: Just try to make sure it doesnt get out.        
	The campus community was not formally notified of the first two shootings until 9:26. The shootings at Norris Hall began at 9:40.        
	While conceding that university officials had a responsibility to avoid causing panic, parents of victims expressed frustration at the reports findings.        
	These were serious mistakes, and we still dont feel like everything that should be known has been revealed, said Lori Haas, the mother of Emily Haas, who was wounded in the shootings.         
	The new report said that the university presidents office was locked down about 30 minutes before a formal warning was issued to the rest of the campus and that the local police, in Blacksburg, took more than half an hour longer than was initially believed to begin looking for a suspect, a fact first reported by The Richmond Times-Dispatch.        
	The report also says that at least two members of the universitys policy group, which was assembled to manage the crisis, let their own families know of the first two shootings, in the residence hall, more than 90 minutes before the group warned the rest of the campus.        
	Mark Owczarski, a spokesman for the university, said the revised report was inaccurate and lacked context.        
	The revised report describes the two people who alerted their families as policy group members, and they were not, Owczarski said. It also inaccurately describes the actions of those two individuals who alerted their families as though it occurred with approval of senior officials. It did not. Owczarski said the two people who alerted their families were secretaries for university officials. One secretary mentioned the shooting while calling her son to wake him up for class, he said.         
	The other was visiting her mother when she was called by campus officials and told to get to work because there had been a shooting. Before leaving, she told her mother of the situation, Owczarski said.        
	But W. Gerald Massengill, the former state police superintendent who led the states investigation, rejected the contention that policy group members did not alert their families. I remember almost with certainty the names assigned to the messages that went out, and they were officials, Massengill said.

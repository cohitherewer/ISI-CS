	Hair like Scarlett    
	 London, March 18: Blonde women are dyeing their hair brown like Scarlett Johansson  to be taken more seriously in the office, reports The Daily Telegraph.      
	One in three female employees with light-coloured hair have followed in the footsteps of Scarlett Johansson and Black Eyed Peas singer Fergie by adopting a more sober shade.      
	The trend comes at a time when companies the length and breadth of Britain are laying off staff amid the deepening recession.      
	Researchers also found 62 per cent of people think brunettes look more professional than blondes in the workplace. Dan Hadley of Superdrug, which commissioned the study, said: The current economic climate is obviously making women take more care with their appearance at work, even down to their hair colour.       
	The study shows brunettes do seem to be taken more seriously in the work place which is causing a rise in fair headed women darkening their locks. Its incredible how changing your hair colour can alter peoples perception of you as well as making you feel more confident too.    
	Slum slot     
	 Hong Kong (AP): Academy Award-winning Slumdog Millionaire has secured a coveted slot as one of 20 major foreign movies that China will import this year, a distributor said on Wednesday. Many Hollywood movies miss out on the booming Chinese cinema market because of the annual quota, and others are weeded out by the censorship process. Chinese censors are wary of unflattering portrayals of the country and its people. But Millionaire cleared Chinese censors easily, Zhang Hongyan, a publicist for the distributor, Hong Kong-based Edko Film, said. Director Danny Boyle will attend the British movies premiere in Beijing next Wednesday, with the film going on general release in at least 2,000 theatres across China.    
	Warhol art    
	 Paris (AP): Smiling, cherrylipped princesses, rock royalty, politicians, artists in eyepopping hues and, of course, Marilyn Monroe, her melancholy face reproduced over and over. A vast new exhibition at Pariss Grand Palais brings together Andy Warhols iconic celebrity portraits and works of those who had $40,000 to spare for a set of commissioned canvases. Warhol churned out an estimated 1,000 portraits most of them commissions. He used to say: I have to pay the rent; I have to bring home the bacon, says the exhibits curator, Alain Cueff, adding that he thinks the irreverent and often flippant pop artist had something more serious in mind.

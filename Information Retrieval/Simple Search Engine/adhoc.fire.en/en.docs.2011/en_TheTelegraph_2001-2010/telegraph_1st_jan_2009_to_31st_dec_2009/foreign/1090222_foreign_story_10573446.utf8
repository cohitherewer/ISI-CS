	Mingora (Pakistan), Feb. 21 (Reuters): Taliban fighters and Pakistani officials have agreed to a permanent ceasefire in the northwestern Swat Valley, a senior government official said today.        
	However, Taliban fighters said today they would review their ceasefire when it runs out next week, casting doubt over government talk of a permanent truce.         
	Last Sunday, Islamist militants called a 10-day ceasefire in the valley as a goodwill gesture towards the peace talks. We heard that the government announced a permanent ceasefire, but we have announced a 10-day ceasefire and we will consider an extension when it ends, Taliban commander Maulana Fazlullah, also known as Mullah Radio because he uses illegal FM radio to spread his message, said.        
	Earlier, Syed Mohammad Javed, the commissioner of Malakand, told reporters after meeting elders in Swat: They have made a commitment that they will observe a permanent ceasefire and well do the same,        
	Around 1,200 people have been killed and between 250,000 and 500,000 people have fled the valley which lies within the Malakand division of North West Frontier Province. Western governments, and many Pakistanis, have been alarmed by the governments offer to reinstate Islamic sharia law in Malakand if the Taliban agreed to peace.        
	They fear that a ceasefire could result in another sanctuary in Pakistan where al Qaida and Taliban militants could move freely, and also worry that Taliban fighters elsewhere in the region will be encouraged by the governments move. Javed said efforts were being made to persuade the Taliban to allow girls schools to reopen. Militants had torched around 200 girls schools in Swat in a campaign against female education.

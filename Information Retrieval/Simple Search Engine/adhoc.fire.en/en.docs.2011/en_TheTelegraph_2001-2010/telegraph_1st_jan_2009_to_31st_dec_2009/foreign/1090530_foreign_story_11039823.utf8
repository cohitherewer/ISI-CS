          MICHAEL BIRNBAUM                          Kavya                                  
	Washington, May 29: A tangle of words, letters and anxiety filled the halls of the hotel where the culminating rounds of the Scripps National Spelling Bee were held yesterday.         
	One by one, seats opened up on the blue-and-red stage as the words that students traced on their palms turned out to be incorrect. Finally, minutes past 10pm, and about 12 hours after the days competition began, Centreville home-schooler Tim Ruiter, 12, missed the word Maecenas, meaning a generous benefactor. That gave Kavya Shivashankar of Olathe, Kansas, the victory after she spelled Laodicean, meaning lukewarm or indifferent in religion or politics. It was the 13-year-old girls fourth trip to the nationals. Ive learned so many things, so many roots and... discipline, focus, Kavya said late last night.         
	She will take home a trophy, $37,500, a collection of reference works  and glory. Tim said that he plans to be back next year and that he will take only a short break  Ill go to bed  before he resumes word study. Im glad that she won, he said.         
	Early drama swirled around Kavya and Sidharth Chand, 13, who as eighth-graders had one last chance to win the championship. Kavya, the eventual victor, had tied for fourth place last year, and Sidharth of Bloomfield Hills, Michagan, was back after seizing second place.

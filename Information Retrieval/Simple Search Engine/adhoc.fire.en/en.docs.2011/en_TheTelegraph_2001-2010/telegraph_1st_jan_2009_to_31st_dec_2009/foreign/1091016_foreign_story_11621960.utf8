	Brothel discount    
	 Berlin, Oct. 15: Stung by the economic crisis, a brothel in Berlin is offering discounts to clients who can prove they arrived by public transport or bicycle  with some success, reports The Daily Telegraph.      
	Everyones a winner, explained Regina Gtz, a former prostitute who runs the Maison dEnvie (House of Desire) brothel in Berlins Prenzlauer Berg, a district in the former East Berlin.      
	The environment is a topic on everyones lips and its pretty difficult to park around here. So we came up with the idea of an eco discount of 5 euros (4.60) to anyone who leaves the car at home, Gtz said.

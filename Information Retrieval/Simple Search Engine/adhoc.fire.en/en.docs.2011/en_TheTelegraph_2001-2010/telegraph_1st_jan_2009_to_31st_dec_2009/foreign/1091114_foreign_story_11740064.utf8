	Peshawar, Nov. 13 (AP): A suicide bomber in a pick-up truck today attacked the northwestern regional headquarters of the ISI overseeing a campaign against militancy, killing 10 people.        
	Another suicide assault in the area killed six more.        
	The attack on the ISI building took place in Peshawar, which has borne the brunt of the militants retaliation against the army offensive. A wave of bombings in the last week alone in and around the city has killed more than 50 people.        
	This is a guerrilla war, said Mian Iftikhar Hussain, the information minister for the North West Frontier Province. We will continue our action against these militant terrorists. That is the only way we can survive. Security forces guarding the intelligence complex opened fire on the truck laden with explosives, but the bomber was able to detonate his payload, said an intelligence official.        
	 The early morning blast, heard across the city, destroyed much of the three-storey building and killed 10 people, including seven who worked for the spy agency, the army said .

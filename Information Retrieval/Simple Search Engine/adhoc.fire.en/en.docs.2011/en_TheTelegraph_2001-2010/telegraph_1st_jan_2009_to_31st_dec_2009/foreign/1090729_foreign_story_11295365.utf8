	Body shock    
	 London (PTI): Madonnas pursuit to acquire the perfect body has backfired. The 50-year-old star shocked onlookers here as she stepped out in a short-sleeve top revealing her protruding muscles and thick bulging veins in her arms which were visible through her ageing and wrinkled skin, reports the Daily Mail.

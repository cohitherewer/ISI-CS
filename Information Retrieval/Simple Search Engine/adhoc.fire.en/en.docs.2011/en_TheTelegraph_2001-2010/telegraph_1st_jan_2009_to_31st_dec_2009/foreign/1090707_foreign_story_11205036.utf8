The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Scores die in China riots

	Urumqi (China), July 6 (Reuters): At least 140 people have been killed in rioting in Chinas northwestern region of Xinjiang, with the government blaming exiled separatists for the Muslim areas worst case of unrest in years.        
	Hundreds of rioters have been arrested, the official Xinhua news agency reported, after rock-throwing Uighur people took to the streets of the regional capital yesterday, some burning and smashing vehicles and confronting ranks of anti-riot police.        
	Signalling a security crackdown in the strategic region near Pakistan and central Asia, a senior Chinese government official said the unrest was the work of extremist forces abroad.        
	This was a crime of violence that was pre-meditated and organised, Xinhua quoted the unnamed official as saying.        
	He blamed the violence on the World Uighur Congress led by Rebiya Kadeer, a Uighur businesswoman now in exile in the US after years in jail, and accused of separatist activities. She did not answer calls for comment.        
	But exiled Uighur groups adamantly rejected the Chinese government claim of a plot. They said the riot was an outpouring of pent-up anger over government policies and Han Chinese dominance of economic opportunities.        
	Chinas markets largely brushed off the riots, with the benchmark Shanghai Composite index ending up 1.2 per cent at a 13-month closing high, bucking a generally weaker trend in the rest of Asia. This is regional unrest only, said Zheshang Securities analyst Zhang Yanbing.        
	The unrest underscores the volatile ethnic tensions that have accompanied Chinas growing economic and political stake in its western frontiers.        
	Along with Tibet, Xinjiang is one of the most politically sensitive regions in China, and in both cases the government has sought to maintain its grip by controlling religious and cultural life while also vowing economic growth and prosperity.        
	But analysts said the fresh trouble in the remote resource-rich region was unlikely to have a major impact on Chinas economy.

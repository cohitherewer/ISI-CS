	Washington, Dec. 1: Loneliness is like a disease  and what is worse, its contagious.        
	Although it may sound counterintuitive, loneliness can spread from one person to another, according to research released today that underscores the power of one persons emotions to affect friends, family and neighbours.        
	The federally funded analysis of data collected from more than 4,000 people over 10 years found that lonely people increase the chances that someone they know will start to feel alone. The solitary feeling can spread one more degree of separation, causing a friend of a friend or even the sibling of a friend to feel desolate.        
	Loneliness can be transmitted, said John T. Cacioppo, a University of Chicago psychologist who led the study being published in the December issue of the Journal of Personality and Social Psychology. Loneliness is not just the property of an individual. It can be transmitted across people  even people you dont have direct contact with.        
	Moreover, people who become lonely eventually move to the periphery of their social networks, becoming increasingly isolated, which can exacerbate their loneliness and affect social connectedness.        
	No man is an island, said Nicholas A. Christakis, a professor of medicine and medical sociology at Harvard Medical School. Something so personal as a persons emotions can have a collective existence and affect the vast fabric of humanity.        
	The seemingly paradoxical finding is far more than a psychological curiosity. Loneliness has been linked to a variety of medical problems, including depression, sleep problems and generally poorer physical health.         
	But some researchers expressed scepticism about the findings, saying the study had the same shortcoming as the earlier work and could not rule out other explanations for the apparent association.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | White House aide quits over NY flight
                                                                                                               White House aide quits over NY flight
                            
	Washington, May 9 (Reuters): A White House military aide who authorised an Air Force flyover of New York that caused panic among some people in the city resigned yesterday.        
	Louis Caldera said in a resignation letter to President Barack Obama that the controversy over the mission  a photo shoot of a jumbo jet used as Air Force One with the Statue of Liberty in the background  made it impossible for him to lead the White House Military Office.        
	The flight over lower Manhattan for a photo shoot scared some New Yorkers who remembered the September 11 attacks in 2001 involving hijacked airliners that destroyed the World Trade Center. Some people panicked and evacuated office buildings when the planes flew over.        
	Caldera had approved the mission. His resignation came on the same day defence secretary Robert Gates said in a letter to Senator John McCain that the photo shoot cost US taxpayers as much as $357,000.        
	White House spokesman Robert Gibbs said Obama had accepted the resignation. Obama had been described as furious when the incident occurred on April 27 and demanded a review.        
	McCain, who lost to Obama in last years presidential election and is the ranking Republican on the Senate Armed Services Committee, called the incident an Air Farce 1 photo op.        
	The report of the review, also released yesterday, said ultimately Caldera did not notify relevant White House officials about the flyover in advance.        
	When asked why he failed to do so, he did not offer a coherent explanation. He stated that it was not a conscious decision  he did not intend not to notify them, it said. Instead, he suggested that it may have been an oversight.        
	Also released was a photo of the Air Force jet over the Statue of Liberty from the mission.

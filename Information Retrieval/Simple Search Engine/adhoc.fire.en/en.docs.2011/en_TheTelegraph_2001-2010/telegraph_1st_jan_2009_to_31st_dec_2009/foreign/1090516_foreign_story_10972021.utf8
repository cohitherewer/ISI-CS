	London (PTI): Hollywood star Leonardo DiCaprio came close to being knocked off during a basketball game when one of the players dived into the audience. The Titanic star was sitting in the front row with fellow actor Kevin Spacey during a match being played by his favourite team, Los Angeles Lakers, when a player from the opposing team, Houston Rockets, jumped into the crowd to grab the ball, reports Mirror online. Caprio saved himself from an embarrassing accident by hunching up.

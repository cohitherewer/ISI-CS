The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Smacked kids have lower IQs
                                                                                                               Smacked kids have lower IQs

	London, Sept. 25: Children who are smacked by their parents are less intelligent than their classmates, a new study shows.        
	Researchers warned that children who were regularly smacked could suffer symptoms more closely associated with post-traumatic stress disorder, including becoming more fearful and easily startled.        
	However, parents could be also more inclined to hit less intelligent children, they admit. The findings are likely to re-open the debate over whether it is right for parents to be allowed to smack their children.        
	The study looked at more than 1,500 children split into two groups, the first aged between two and four and the second aged between five and nine. Researchers recorded how often the children were smacked by their parents over four years and then tested their intelligence.        
	They found that the IQ of those in the younger age groups was an average of five points lower if they had been spanked than if they had not.

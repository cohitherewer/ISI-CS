The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Jolie refugee comment stirs debate
                                                                                                               Jolie refugee comment stirs debate
                              Jolie                            
	Bangkok, Feb. 13 (AP): Thailands government may still be miffed at Angelina Jolie for speaking out on behalf of impoverished boat people, but the actress has prompted soul-searching among some in the Southeast Asian country.        
	For a second day, Thai officials rebuked the globe-trotting leading lady for calling on the country to respect the rights of the Rohingya, a Muslim minority people fleeing nearby Myanmars military dictatorship.        
	Jolie was in Thailand last week as a UN goodwill ambassador, touring a northern camp for other refugees from Myanmar. Instead of blaming Jolie... why dont we start talking about the root cause of the problem? an editorial in the English-language The Nation asked.

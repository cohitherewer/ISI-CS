The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Wine tastes better in blue rooms
                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      Wine tastes better in blue rooms
          RICHARD ALLEYNE                              
	London, Dec. 15: Wine tastes better if a room is backlit with red or blue ambient lights, a psychologist has found.        
	Drinkers brains are tricked into thinking a glass of white wine is better and more expensive tasting when exposed to the red or blue background lighting than those in rooms with green or white background lighting.        
	And connoisseurs are warned to be wary of unscrupulous bar owners who try to pass off cheap plonk in trendy lit bars.        
	German researchers gave drinkers the same bottle of Riesling in the differently lit environments and asked for their feedback. They found the same wine was perceived as being nearly one-and-a-half times sweeter in red light than in white or green light.        
	Its fruitiness was also most highly rated in red light.                    THE DAILY TELEGRAPH

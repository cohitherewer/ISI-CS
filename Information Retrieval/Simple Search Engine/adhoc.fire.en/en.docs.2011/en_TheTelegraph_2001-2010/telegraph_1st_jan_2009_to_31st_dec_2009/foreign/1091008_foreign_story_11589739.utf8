	Cruz courage    
	 London, Oct. 7 (PTI): Actress Penelope Cruz was so adamant on getting her stunts right in her next film Nine that even injuries did not deter her.      
	Cruz, who stars with Sophia Loren, Nicole Kidman, Judi Dench and Kate Hudson in the film, was hoisted up in the air for one particularly trying scene. According to director Rob Marshall, Cruzs blood, sweat and tears went into nailing the take, reports website Contactmusic.com.

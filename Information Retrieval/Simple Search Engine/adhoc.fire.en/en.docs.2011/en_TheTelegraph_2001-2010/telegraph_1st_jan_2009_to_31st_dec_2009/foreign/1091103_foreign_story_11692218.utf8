	Swank judge    
	 Los Angeles, Nov. 2 (PTI): Actress Hilary Swank, who plays aviation pioneer Amelia Earhart in director Mira Nairs Amelia, says that it is unfair to judge people by their appearances.       
	The 35-year-old Hollywood star says that everyone is beautiful in their own unique way. Being an actor we are constantly objectified. Things are thrown at us about what we look like, how we should look, were not this enough or thats enough, its easy to look at yourself in those terms. I think ultimately there are so many different ways a person is beautiful, Swank said.     
	Lohan lock    
	London (PTI): It seems that Lindsay Lohan has moved on from her on/off lesbian lover DJ Samantha Ronson as the actress was seen locking lips with none other than actor Gerard Butler. It came just days after she was spotted with a male model. Looking stylish in a black dress, the 23-year-old actress and the 39-year-old Butler were spotted enjoying a night out at a beach resort in Morocco. Lohan put her trilby on Butlers head, turned up his collar and started dirty dancing. The duo ended up in a corner kissing, which was followed by more dancing and flirting, reports the Daily Mirror.    
	Jolie life    
	 London (PTI): There may be many young actresses in Hollywood who aspire to be like superstar Angelina Jolie, but Twilight star Kristen Stewart is not one of them. The 19-year-old actress, who feels that a celebritys life is similar to that of a vampire as it is sad and desolate, said that she does not want a life like that of Jolie. I dont want to be a movie star like Angelina Jolie. Nothing about being a celebrity is desirable. Im an actor, its bizarre to me that everybodys so obsessive, she said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Longing for baby? Try ugly men
                                                                                                               Longing for baby? Try ugly men
                            
	London, July 10: Handsome men who are lucky in love may not be the best bet as a mate for women hoping to get pregnant, researchers have said.         
	 Uglier men with fewer notches on their belts are likely to be more productive between the sheets, it is claimed.        
	Research suggests that in many species, the most desirable males restrict their sperm load with each mating to ensure enough to go around. The same could be true of humans and other primates, say scientists. If they are right, women looking for the best chance of getting pregnant might be advised to avoid handsome Lotharios.        
	The theory proposes that males have evolved to look for the optimum sperm load per mating. This varies depending on how many available females there are to mate with, and what the chances of mating with them are.

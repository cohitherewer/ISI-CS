	Colombo, May 10 (AP): An all-night artillery barrage in Sri Lankas war zone killed at least 378 civilians and forced thousands to flee to makeshift shelters along the beach, a government doctor said today.        
	The army and the Tamil Tigers blamed each other for the barrage, which the doctor said left at least 1,100 people wounded. He said it was the bloodiest day he had seen in months of fighting.        
	Dr V. Shanmugarajah said many more were likely killed in the barrage, but they were buried where they fell instead of being taken to the makeshift hospital where he works in the war zone. He described the situation at the understaffed hospital as overwhelming.        
	The rebel-linked TamilNet website said 2,000 civilians were feared dead and blamed the attack on Sri Lankan forces. The Lankan military denied firing the artillery and said the rebels appeared to be firing mortar shells from one corner of the tiny area still under their control into another section densely populated with civilians.        
	The rebels are trying to use these people as their last weapon to show the world that the army is firing indiscriminately and stop this offensive, military spokesperson Brigadier Udaya Nanayakkara said.        
	The government vowed two weeks ago to cease firing heavy weapons to avoid civilian casualties. However, medical officials in the area have reported that air strikes and artillery attacks have continued unabated, despite the presence of an estimated 50,000 ethnic Tamil civilians in the conflict zone.        
	In todays attack, Shanmugarajah said, shells flew through the air, some falling near the hospital, sending many diving into bunkers for safety.        
	Today, Sri Lanka deported three journalists for London-based Channel 4 television news, a day after they were arrested for alleged false reporting on the islands civil war.

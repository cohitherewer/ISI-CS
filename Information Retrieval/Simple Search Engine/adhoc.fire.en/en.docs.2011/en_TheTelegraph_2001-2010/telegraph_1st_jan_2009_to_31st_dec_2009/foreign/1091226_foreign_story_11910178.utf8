          RICHARD ALLEYNE                          Lumps of myrrh                                  
	London, Dec. 25: The Three Wise Men were actually being cleverer than they thought  scientists have discovered that myrrh is good for your heart.        
	The ancient resin, used traditionally as a perfume or embalming fluid, may help lower cholesterol levels if taken as a food supplement.        
	Myrrh is a rust-coloured resin obtained from several species of Commiphora and Balsamodendron trees, native to West Asia and Ethiopia.        
	It is best known as one of the gifts of the Three Wise Men offered to the infant Jesus, along with gold and frankincense.        
	At the time, myrrh was revered as an embalming ointment and as a perfume but it seems that as well preserving you in death it can preserve you in life too.        
	In the study, published in the International Journal of Food Safety, Nutrition and Public Health, Nadia Saleh Al-Amoudi, a researcher from King Abd Al-Aziz University in Saudi Arabia noted that myrrh has long been used as a medicinal treatment for sore throats, congestion, and cuts and burns.

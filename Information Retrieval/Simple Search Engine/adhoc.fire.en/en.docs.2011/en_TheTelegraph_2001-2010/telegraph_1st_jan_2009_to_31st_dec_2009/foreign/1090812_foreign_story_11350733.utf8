The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Hillary loses temper over husband
                                                                                                               Hillary loses temper over husband
                              Hillary: Angry                            
	London, Aug. 11: Hillary Clinton has snapped at a Congolese university student after, as she heard it, he asked what her husband thought about an international financial matter.         
	My husband is not (the US) secretary of state, I am, she said in Kinshasa, the capital of Congo.        
	You want me to tell you what my husband thinks? she asked incredulously when the student raised a question about a multibillion-dollar Chinese loan offer to Congo.         
	If you want my opinion, I will tell you my opinion, she said. I am not going to be channelling my husband.         
	State department officials said the student approached Hillary afterwards and told her he had meant to ask what President Barack Obama, not Bill Clinton, thought about the Chinese loan.

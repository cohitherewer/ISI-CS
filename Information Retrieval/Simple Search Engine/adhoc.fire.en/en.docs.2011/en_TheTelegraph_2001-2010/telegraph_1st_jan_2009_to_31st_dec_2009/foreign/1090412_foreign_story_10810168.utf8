	Paltrow clothes    
	 London, April 11 (PTI): Looks like Gwyneth Paltrow has finally realised that she has too many clothes, and, therefore, the Hollywood actress has decided to auction some off for charitys sake.      
	 The Shakespeare In Love actress will auction off her designer goodies at eBay and the proceeds will go to Robinhood Foundation, an organisation that runs many programmes for the poor in New York city, reported Daily Mirror online.      
	It seems that Paltrow has taken inspiration from best friend Madonna who recently donated money to the victims of the earthquake in Italy. The 36-year-old actress who moved to Britain after marrying ColdPlay frontman Chris Martin, is currently in the US shooting for Iron Man 2.

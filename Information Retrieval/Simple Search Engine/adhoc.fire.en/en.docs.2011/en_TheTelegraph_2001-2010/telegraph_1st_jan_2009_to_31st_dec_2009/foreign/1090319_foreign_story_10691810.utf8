The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Mukhtar weds, removes stigma against rape victims 
                                                                                                               Mukhtar weds, removes stigma against rape victims 
          SALMAN MASOOD                          Mukhtar Mai: Bold step                                  
	Islamabad, March 18: Mukhtar Mai, the resilient Pakistani who was gangraped in 2002 on the orders of a village council but became a symbol of hope for voiceless and oppressed women, has married.        
	In a telephone interview yesterday, Mukhtar, 37, said her new husband was a police constable who was assigned to guard her in the wake of the attack and who had been asking for her hand for several years. She is his second wife.         
	She said the constable, Nasir Abbas Gabol, 30, and she married on Sunday in a simple ceremony in her dusty farming village, Meerwala, in Punjab province.         
	He says he madly fell in love with me, Mukhtar said with a big laugh when asked what finally persuaded her to say yes.         
	Pakistani rape victims often commit suicide, but Mukhtar instead successfully challenged her attackers in court. By marrying, she has defeated another stigma against rape victims in conservative Pakistani society.         
	The village council ordered her rape as a punishment for actions attributed to her younger brother. He was accused of having illicit relations with a woman from a rival clan, but investigations showed that the boy had been molested by three of that clans tribesmen, and the accusation against him had been a cover-up. Gabol was one of a group of police officers deployed to protect her after she was threatened by the rapists relatives.        
	He had a hard time persuading Mukhtar to marry. He had been calling her off and on since 2003 but formally proposed a year and a half ago, she said. But I told my parents I dont want to get married. Finally, four months ago, he tried to kill himself by taking sleeping pills. The morning after he attempted suicide, his wife and parents met my parents but I still refused, Mukhtar said. Gabol then threatened to divorce his first wife, Shumaila. Shumaila, along with Gabols parents and sisters, tried to talk Mukhtar into marrying him, taking on the status of second wife. In Pakistan, a man can legally have up to four wives.         
	It was her concern about Shumaila, Mukhtar said, that moved her to relent.

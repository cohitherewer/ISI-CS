The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Malay model ready for cane

	London, Aug. 21: A Muslim model has asked human rights group Amnesty International to stop asking the Malaysian authorities not to cane her, saying she is ready to face the penalty for drinking beer.        
	Kartika Sari Dewi Shukarno, a 32-year-old mother of two, insisted she is willing to be lashed six times with a rattan cane next week for breaching the countrys Shariah law, which forbids Muslims to consume alcohol.        
	I want to respect the law, Kartika said from her northern home state of Perak. Who am I to question the Islamic authorities laws? That is beyond me. I never cried when I was sentenced by the judge. I told myself, alright then, lets get on with it.        
	According to Reuters, Kartika has asked the authorities that the punishment be carried out in public.        
	Kartika is to become the first Malaysian woman to be caned after she was arrested in a raid for drinking beer at a hotel lounge last year and sentenced by a Shariah court in July in what was considered a warning to other Muslims to abide by religious laws.        
	Amnesty International earlier urged authorities to immediately revoke the sentence to cane her and abolish the practice of caning altogether. Caning is a form of cruel, inhuman and degrading punishment and is prohibited under international human rights law, it said.        
	Government lawyer Saiful Idham Sahimi said earlier this week the penalty was appropriate. Islamic authorities insist that the purpose of the caning is to educate rather than punish. They say the rattan cane to be used on Kartika will be smaller and lighter than the one used for men and that she will remain clothed.        
	 The prison official who canes her is also supposed to use very little force.                             THE DAILY TELEGRAPH

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Fonseka to run
                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      Fonseka to run
                                  
	Colombo, Nov. 29 (Reuters): The Sri Lankan general who oversaw the end of 25 years of war said today he would run for President, pitting himself against the man who also takes credit for the victory against the Tamil Tigers.        
	Army veteran Sarath Fonseka quit the military after a 34-month offensive, accusing President Mahinda Rajapaksa of sidelining him over unfounded coup fears.        
	He could now split Rajapaksas support base and win over the votes of Sri Lankans happy the conflict is over. I have decided to contest in the presidential poll as a common candidate of the Opposition parties, on their request, Fonseka, the former chief of defence staff, said

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Osama tape reminds US of Israel ties
                                                                                                               Osama tape reminds US of Israel ties
                            
	Dubai, Sept. 14 (Reuters): Al Qaida leader Osama bin Laden warned the American people over their governments close ties with Israel in an apparently new audio tape posted on an Islamist website today.        
	The time has come for you to liberate yourselves from fear and the ideological terrorism of neo-conservatives and the Israeli lobby, Bin Ladens latest tape said.        
	The reason for our dispute with you is your support for your ally Israel, occupying our land in Palestine. The message, entitled A statement to the American people, was posted a few days after the eighth anniversary of the September 11, 2001, attacks.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Clooney rebuffs male suitor
                                                                                                               Clooney rebuffs male suitor
          NICK SQUIRES                          Clooney with his Italian girlfriend Elisabetta Canalis in Venice. (Reuters)                                  
	Rome, Sept. 9: George Clooney laughed off questions about his private life at the Venice Film Festival yesterday, including whether he could imagine falling in love with a man.        
	Clooney, 48, joked about his relationship with the director of his latest film, Grant Heslov, when a journalist asked him whether he could envisage marrying a man. Grant and I are actually announcing our wedding while were here, Clooney said.         
	Then, the packed news conference was dramatically interrupted when a man in the audience stripped down to his pants and professed his love for the Hollywood star. Its always embarrassing when you swing for the fence and it just falls flat, Clooney said, as the man stripped off his shirt, leaving on his tie.         
	But the tie looks good, he said as security guards wrested the microphone away from the unidentified man.

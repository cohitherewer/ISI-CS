                                                                                                               2 Christians killed in Pak clashes
                            
	Islamabad, Aug. 1 (Reuters): Six Christians, including four women, were burnt alive in clashes with majority Muslims in a town in central Pakistan today, officials said.        
	Tension has been running high between the two communities in Gojra town, central Punjab province, over allegations that Christians had desecrated a Quran.         
	Clashes erupted early today with an exchange of fire between the members of the two communities. Television footage showed burning houses and streets strewn with blackened furniture and people firing at each other from rooftops.        
	Shahbaz Bhatti, minister for minorities, said a mob misled by religious extremists, attacked a Christian neighbourhood and torched dozens of houses. We have received six bodies of people who died of burn injuries. They included four women, one man and one child, Abdul Hamid, a health official said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Sarko forces Dati to quit
                                                                                                               Sarko forces Dati to quit
          CHARLES BREMNER                          A January 7, 2009, file picture of Sarkozy and Dati in Paris. (Reuters)                                  
	Paris, Jan. 24: Rachida Dati, the glamorous but troublesome politician who returned to work five days after giving birth, has been forced to quit President Sarkozys government.         
	Dati, 43, has reluctantly agreed to run for the European Parliament in June after falling out of favour with her longstanding mentor. The President made it clear that this would mean leaving the cabinet, and Dati is expected to resign after she wins a safe seat as an MEP.         
	For months Dati, the emblem of ethnic diversity in the Sarkozy administration, had been clinging to her job as justice minister in the face of a revolt by the judges, prison staff and court personnel. Her return to her ministry only days after having a daughter by Caesarean section was seen as an act of devotion to Sarkozy and of desperation to keep a job that has been under threat since the summer. Sarkozy had been unwilling to remove the woman whom he had groomed and promoted from a lowly advisers post to the most senior cabinet job held by a member of Frances North African minority. However, the President made no secret of his disappointment as her career was spoilt by a disastrous performance.         
	Her failure is a setback for Sarkozy because he took a gamble in backing the woman he once called my little Arab girl, propelling a political neophyte with no management experience into a big cabinet post. Dati alienated subordinates as she implemented radical court and prison reforms as decreed by Sarkozy. Her extravagant tastes jarred with the gravity of her mission and the austere national mood. The highly publicised pregnancy and speculation over the identity of the father of Zohra, her daughter, was the final straw for a President who wants to project an image of sombre seriousness. Dati resisted to the end, trying to force Sarkozys hand last week by announcing that he had asked her to stay in her job for all of 2009. The move to the European Parliament at least offers her a dignified exit.

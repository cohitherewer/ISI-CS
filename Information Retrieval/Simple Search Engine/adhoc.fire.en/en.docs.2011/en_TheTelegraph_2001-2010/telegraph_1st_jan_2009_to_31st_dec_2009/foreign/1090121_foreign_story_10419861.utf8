The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Sparkling dress
                                                                                                               Sparkling dress
                            
	Washington, Jan. 20 (AP): First Lady Michelle Obama wore a sparkling yellow-gold sheath dress with matching coat by Cuban-born American designer Isabel Toledo for the inauguration of her husband, a choice many applauded as a cheerful message of hope and a vote for the American fashion industry.        
	She paired the embellished ensemble with green gloves from J. Crew and green shoes. President Barack Obama wore a red tie and white shirt with his suit, topped with an overcoat adorned with an American flag pin. Their daughters were style icons in their own right, with 10-year-old Malia in a double-breasted periwinkle-blue coat with a blue-ribbon bow at the waist, and Sasha, 7, in a pink coat with an orange scarf and satin belt, a coral-coloured dress peeking out at the hem. Their coats were from Crewcuts by J. Crew.        
	The fashion industry has anxiously looked to the election of Obama for months, embracing his wife as an emblem and ambassador of modern American style. She has won praise for her penchant for lesser-known designers and bold fashion choices, mixed with her unabashed love for mass fashion from mainstream American retailers. She is single-handedly breathing new life into designers like Narciso Rodriguez and Isabel Toledo, who have had a rocky past, said red-carpet and editorial stylist Mary Alice Stephenson.

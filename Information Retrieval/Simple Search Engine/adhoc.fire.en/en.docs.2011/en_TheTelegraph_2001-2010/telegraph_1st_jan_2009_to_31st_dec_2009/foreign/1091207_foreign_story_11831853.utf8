	Cruz jitters    
	 London, Dec. 6 (PTI): Penelope Cruz has said she is terrified of singing. The Oscar-winning actress is shooting for her new movie Nine in which she has tried her hand at singing for the first time. The Spanish beauty admitted that her singing was a bit rusty because she hadnt done it in public for years, Femalefirst reported. Singing was terrifying because it was new and because it was my first time. It was like doing theatre, but I only did theatre as a student in Spain, she said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | China admits deaths
                                                                                                               China admits deaths
                            
	Urumqi (China), July 18 (Reuters): Chinese police shot and killed 12 Uighur rioters in Xinjiang this month, regional governor Nuer Baikeli said today, in a rare government admission of deaths inflicted by security forces.        
	In Xinjiangs worst ethnic unrest in decades, Uighurs attacked majority Han Chinese in regional capital Urumqi on July 5 after taking to the streets to protest against an ethnic clash at a factory in south China in June which left two Uighurs dead.        
	The violence left 197 people dead and more than 1,600 wounded, mostly Han Chinese who launched revenge attacks in Urumqi days later. About 1,000 people, mostly Uighurs, have been detained in an ensuing government crackdown.        
	Asked to elaborate on the casualties, the governor said most of the victims sustained head wounds after they were bludgeoned with iron rods.        
	Police shot dead 12 armed Uighurs attacking civilians and ransacking shops after they ignored warning shots fired into the air, said Nuer Baikeli, a Uighur, a Turkic people who are largely Muslim and share cultural bonds with Central Asia.        
	Of the 12, three were killed on the spot, while nine died either on their way to or after arriving at hospital. In any country ruled by law, the use of force is necessary to protect the interest of the people and stop violent crime, the governor said.

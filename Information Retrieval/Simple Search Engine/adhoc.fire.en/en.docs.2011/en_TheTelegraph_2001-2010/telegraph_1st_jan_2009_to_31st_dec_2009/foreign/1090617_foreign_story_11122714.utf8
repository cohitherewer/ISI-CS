The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Tehran agrees to partial recount   Hardline council rejects call to annul polls

	Tehran, June 16 (Reuters): Irans top legislative body today ruled out annulling a disputed presidential poll that has prompted the biggest street protests since the 1979 Islamic revolution, but said it was prepared for a partial recount.        
	In what appeared to be a first concession by authorities to the protest movement, the 12-man Guardian Council said it was ready to re-tally votes in the poll, in which hardline President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad was declared the runaway winner.         
	But the powerful Council rejected reformist calls to annul Fridays election, which set off swift-moving political turmoil, riveting attention on the worlds fifth-biggest oil exporter.        
	And Ahmadinejads supporters appeared to have denied the Opposition the chance to keep up the momentum of mass street protests by mobilising thousands of demonstrators in central Tehran where Mir Hossein Mousavis supporters had planned to gather again.        
	State television said the main agents in post-election unrest had been arrested with explosives and guns.        
	President Barack Obama, who has sought to engage Iran and asked its leadership to unclench its fist, said he was deeply troubled by the post-election violence and that protesters who had taken to the streets had inspired the world.        
	Seven people were killed yesterday on the fringes of a vast Opposition march through the streets of central Tehran.        
	But authorities banned another Opposition rally today and state television showed live pictures of thousands of Ahmadinejad supporters, some waving Iranian flags, gathering at the Vali-ye Asr Square before any Mousavi supporters arrived.        
	At the rally, a former parliamentary speaker, Gholamali Haddadadel, drew cheers by saying that Tehran, where Mousavi won the most votes, did not represent all of Iran. He added: I would like to tell Mousavi:... Before the election was held it was not right for people close to you to say that if you see Ahmadinejad victorious there has been electoral fraud.        
	Mousavi urged his supporters to stay away from the square to protect lives and avoid confrontation with security forces and Ahmadinejad backers. They appeared to have heeded his call.        
	Further protests, especially if they are on the same scale as yesterdays, would be a direct challenge to the authorities who have kept a tight grip on dissent since the US-backed shah was overthrown in 1979 after months of demonstrations.

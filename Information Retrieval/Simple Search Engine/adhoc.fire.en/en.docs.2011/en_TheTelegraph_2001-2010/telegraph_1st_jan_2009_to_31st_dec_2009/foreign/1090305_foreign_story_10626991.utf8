The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Bionic eye gives blind man sight
                                                                                                               Bionic eye gives blind man sight
                            
	London, March 4 (PTI): In one of the rare surgical feats, British doctors have fitted a blind man with a bionic eye that has given the 73-year-old eyesight.         
	A team at the Moorfields Eye Hospital in London, led by Lyndon da Cruz, has carried out the experimental surgery seven months back on Ron who lost his sight 30 years ago, the BBC News website reported.         
	The bionic eye, known as Argus II and developed by US company Second Sight, uses a camera and video processor mounted on sunglasses to send captured images wirelessly to a tiny receiver on the outside of the eye.         
	In turn, the receiver passes on the data via a tiny cable to an array of electrodes which sit on the retina  the layer of specialised cells that respond to light found at the back of the eye. When these electrodes are stimulated they send messages along the optic nerve to the brain, which is able to perceive patterns of light corresponding to which electrodes have been stimulated.

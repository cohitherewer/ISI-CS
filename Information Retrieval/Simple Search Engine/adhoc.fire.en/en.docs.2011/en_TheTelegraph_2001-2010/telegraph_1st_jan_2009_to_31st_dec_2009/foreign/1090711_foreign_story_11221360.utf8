The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Italy media slams Bruni
                                                                                                               Italy media slams Bruni
                            
	Rome, July 10: Carla Bruni, the wife of French President Nicolas Sarkozy, has been criticised by the Italian press for snobbery verging on boorishness for snubbing the summits official programme.         
	Someone tell the First Lady that snobbery to the nth degree where we come from is called boorishness, the paper Il Giornale said as the G8 was wrapping up in LAquila.        
	Yesterday, the other G8 First Ladies, including Michelle Obama, toured the city devastated by an April 6 earthquake, while Bruni visited the disaster zone today.         
	Bruni, who arrived in Italy late yesterday, also stayed away from the wives audience with Pope Benedict XVI on Wednesday.                            THE DAILY TELEGRAPH

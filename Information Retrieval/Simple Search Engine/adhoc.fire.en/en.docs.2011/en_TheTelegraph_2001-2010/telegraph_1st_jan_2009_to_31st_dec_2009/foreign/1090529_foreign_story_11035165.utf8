	Bruni pace    
	 Paris, May 28 (Reuters): Carla Bruni-Sarkozy said today that she was trying to slow the pace of her husbands foreign travels so she could spend more time with the French President.      
	Bruni rarely accompanies President Sarkozy on his travels and she has taken part in only a few major state visits over the past 12 months. The couple have occasionally added a few days of private holiday on to official visits. What I regret is the lack of time, Bruni-Sarkozy told Le Figaro magazine.      
	I am trying to slow the rhythm of our foreign trips ... When I intervene it is just over how we use our time, she said, adding that she never got invol- ved in political decisions.

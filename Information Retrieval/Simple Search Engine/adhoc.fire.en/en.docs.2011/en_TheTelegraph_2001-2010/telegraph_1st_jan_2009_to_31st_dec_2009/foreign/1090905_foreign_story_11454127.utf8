The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Pictured: Hitler, Lenin playing chess
                                                                                                               Pictured: Hitler, Lenin playing chess
                                Hitler and Lenin                           
	Sept. 4: A picture of a young Adolf Hitler apparently playing chess against Vladimir Lenin 100 years ago has come to light.         
	The image is said to have been created in Vienna by Hitlers art teacher, Emma Lowenstramm, and is signed on the reverse by the two dictators. Hitler was a jobbing artist in the city in 1909 and Lenin was in exile and the house where they allegedly played the game belonged to a prominent Jewish family.         
	In the run-up to World War II the Jewish family fled and gave many of their possessions, including the etching and chess set, to their housekeeper. Now their housekeepers great-great grandson is selling the image and the chess set at auction. Both items have a pre-sale estimate of 40,000.         
	The unnamed vendor is confident the items are genuine after his father spent a lifetime attempting to prove their authenticity. He compiled a 300-page forensic document that included tests on the paper, the signatures and research on those involved.         
	Experts, however, have questioned its authenticity especially the identification of Lenin who they say might have been confused with one of his associates.         
	When the etching was made, Hitler was 20 and Lenin was twice his age and the house was where politicos went to discuss things.

	Multan, Dec. 8 (Agencies): A team of militants launched a gun, rocket and suicide attack on an ISI office in central Pakistan today, killing 12 people.        
	They first drove to the Qasim Bela area of Multan, which is the hometown of Prime Minister Yousaf Raza Gilani and foreign minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi, in a truck and attacked security officials manning a checkpost with small arms and rockets.        
	Then the militants drove upto the ISI office situated in the high-security cantonment area and lobbed grenades before blowing up their explosives-laden vehicle, police said.         
	Twelve people, including four soldiers and four children, were killed in the attack, officials of the state-run emergency services said.         
	The injured, which included women and children, were taken to three nearby hospitals. Four were in serious condition.        
	Multan police commissioner Muhammad Ali Gardezi described the assault as a suicide attack and said the target was the ISI office.         
	This was the second attack against the ISI in less than a month. On November 13, suicide bombers attacked its operational headquarters in Peshawar, leaving 12 people dead and 65 injured. The raid in Multan comes a day after twin bombings at a market in Lahore killed 49.        
	Reports said the ISI office and nearby buildings bore the brunt of the blast, which left a huge crater. The facades of several buildings located near the ISI office were blown off. Officials said they feared some people could still be buried in the rubble.         
	In the capital, prosecutors presented the supreme court with a list of alleged graft cases involving President Asif Ali Zardari and thousands of other officials that could be reopened if judges there declare illegal a recently expired amnesty protecting them.

	Washington, Jan. 14 (PTI): President-elect Barack Barack Obama has written a letter to his daughters, Malia,10, and Sasha,7, explaining the familys new journey and why he has chosen this path.        
	These are the things I want for you  to grow up in a world with no limits on your dreams and no achievements beyond your reach, and to grow into compassionate, committed women who will help build that world, Obama wrote in his letter, published in the latest issue of Parade magazine.        
	I want every child to have the same chances to learn and dream and grow and thrive that you girls have. Thats why Ive taken our family on this great adventure, Obama says.        
	Feeling sorry that in the last two years he did not spend enough time with them Obama says: I love you more than you can ever know.

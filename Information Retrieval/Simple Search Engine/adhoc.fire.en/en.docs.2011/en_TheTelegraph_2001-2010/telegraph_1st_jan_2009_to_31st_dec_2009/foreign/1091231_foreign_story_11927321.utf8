The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Mountbatten death strained UK-US ties
                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      Mountbatten death strained UK-US ties
                              Terror message                            
	London, Dec. 30 (PTI): The American response to the killing of Lord Mountbatten, former Viceroy to India, by the IRA in 1979 had put the US-UK special relationship under strain as the condolence message made no reference to terrorism, newly released documents show.        
	Though the message from former President Jimmy Carter to then Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher expressed his profound sadness at the tragic death of the 79-year-old earl, it made no mention of terrorism, the documents from the National show.        
	Britain had not hoped for such a response from the US and Downing Street privately said his (Carters) failure to condemn the IRA was a deficiency, the documents reveal.        
	President Carters message is notable for making no reference to the circumstances of Lord Mountbattens death, said a foreign office official.        
	Theres no mention of murder or terrorism, no condemnation of those who indulge in violence. The Americans must be made to realise that for so long as they continued to finance terrorism, they would be responsible for the deaths of US citizens as well as others, Thatcher said according to the 1979 transcript.

                                                                                                               New Windows
                            
	New York, Oct. 22 (Reuters): Microsoft Corp. launched Windows 7 today in its most important release for more than a decade, aiming to win back customers after the disappointing Vista.        
	The worlds largest software company, which powers more than 90 per cent of personal computers, has received good reviews for the new operating system, which it hopes will grab back the impetus in new technology from rivals Apple Inc and Google Inc.        
	Its the first really significant release of Windows in a decade, analyst Brendan Barnicle of Pacific Crest Securities said. Given the missteps around Vista, people really questioned Microsofts relevancy in the technology space. So this is a critical first step for Microsoft regaining that credibility.        
	The new system  which is faster, less cluttered and has new touch-screen features  comes almost three years after the launch of Vista, whose complexity frustrated many home users and turned off business customers.        
	The success of Windows  which accounts for more than half of Microsofts profit  is crucial for Chief Executive Steve Ballmer to revive the companys image as the worlds most important software firm.        
	I have to say Im chomping at the bit, Ballmer told an audience of Microsoft customers and partners in Toronto yesterday, adding that he is ready to make sales calls himself on Windows 7.

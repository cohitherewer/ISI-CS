	Gilgit (Pakistan), Nov. 12 (Reuters): Voters in Pakistans mountainous far north went to the polls today to elect an Assembly for their district as part of an autonomy package that has angered India.        
	Pakistans Northern Areas have never officially been part of the country, instead they were included in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir after Pakistans independence in 1947.        
	In August, Pakistan announced a plan aimed at giving more of a say to the people of the strategic region, renamed Gilgit-Baltistan, with a first step being an election for an Assembly.        
	People of the sparsely populated region turned out in force to cast their votes.        
	Its our basic right to have our own Assembly and our own representatives, said Mohammad Owais, a 40-year-old shopkeeper standing in a long queue at a polling station in Gilgit, the regions main town.        
	Today we have been given this right.        
	The countrys two main parties, several smaller ones and independent candidates are competing for seats in a 24-member Assembly.        
	Bordering China on one side and Ladakh on the other, the area is known to mountaineers as home to some of the worlds highest peaks.        
	Although Pakistan has held the region since its first war with India in 1948, its status was left in limbo as Pakistan had not wanted to compromise its case in the dispute over Kashmir.        
	In September, India protested to Pakistan over its reform package, saying it was meant to camouflage Pakistans illegal occupation of the area. Pakistan dismissed Indias objections.        
	But politicians in Pakistani Kashmir also oppose the reform package saying it is aimed at integrating Gilgit-Baltistan into Pakistan and would undermine their case for the independence of Kashmir from India.        
	About 300 activists from Kashmiri groups marked the election with a protest in Muzaffarabad, the capital of Pakistani Kashmir.        
	Pakistans expansionist designs in Gilgit-Baltistan are unacceptable, read a banner carried by some protesters.        
	Many of the 1.5 million people of Gilgit-Baltistan oppose integration into Kashmir and want their area to be merged into Pakistan and declared a separate province.        
	Its an old habit of Kashmiri politicians to raise a hue and cry under the pretext of the Kashmir dispute whenever efforts are made to give us our basic rights, said Hussain Ali Rana, a politician in Gilgit.         
	Iran mission death        
	A gunman shot dead a Pakistani working at Irans consulate in Peshawar on Thursday, police said, in an attack likely to compound strains in relations between the two neighbours.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | US fears aid for Pakistan will feed graft

	Islamabad, Sept. 21: As the US prepares to triple its aid package to Pakistan  to a proposed $1.5 billion over the next year  Obama administration officials are debating how much of the assistance should go directly to a government that has been widely accused of corruption, American and Pakistani officials say.        
	A procession of Obama administration economic experts have visited Islamabad in recent weeks to try to ensure both that the money will not be wasted by the government and that it will be more effective in winning the good will of a public increasingly hostile to the US, according to officials involved with the project.        
	As American lawmakers move towards passage of the aid legislation, the administration knows it must get quick results from the increased assistance or face potential Congressional cutbacks down the road in a program envisioned to cost $1.5 billion every year for the next five years.        
	Were struggling over how much cash to give to the government, said a senior American official involved in the planning, who declined to be named according to diplomatic custom. The overhaul of American assistance, led by the state department, comes amid increased urgency about an economic crisis that is intensifying social unrest in Pakistan, and about the willingness of the government there to sustain its fight against a raging insurgency in the northwest.         
	It follows an assessment within the Obama administration that the amount of nonmilitary aid to the country in the past few years was inadequate and favoured American contractors rather than Pakistani recipients, according to several of the American officials involved.        
	American officials say the main goals of the new assistance will be to shore up the crumbling Pakistani state by building infrastructure like roads and power plants, and to improve the standing of the US with the Pakistani people.        
	In return, the Obama administration expects Pakistan to keep up the fight against Islamic militants, though there are worries that the effort will turn out to be a short-term spurt overtaken by Pakistans preoccupation with India.        
	President Asif Ali Zardari has insisted that Pakistan cannot afford to continue its fight against terrorism without substantial American help, a number that he has sometimes put in the tens of billions of dollars. Zardari is scheduled to meet President Obama in New York this week, and assistance is expected to be a major topic.        
	American officials said the need to assist the Pakistani economy directly became alarmingly clear when recent power shortages across the country contributed to Pakistans first year of negative industrial growth.        
	 There were widespread complaints here, including by finance minister Shaukat Tarin, that the government had solutions to improve the power output but was refusing to implement them in order to benefit a handful of power plant operators.        
	Another impetus came last week when 19 women were killed in a stampede for free flour in Karachi, even though Pakistan had a bumper wheat crop this year.        
	After a recent visit to Islamabad, the deputy secretary for management and resources at the state department, Jacob J. Lew, expressed anxiety about how to ensure that the aid money was spent properly, saying he was concerned that the money needed to go to the purposes for which it was intended.

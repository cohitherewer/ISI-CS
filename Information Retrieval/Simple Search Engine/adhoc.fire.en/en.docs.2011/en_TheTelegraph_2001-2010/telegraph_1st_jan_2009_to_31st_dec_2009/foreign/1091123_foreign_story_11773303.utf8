	Lahore, Nov. 22: Pakistan will face a demographic disaster if it does not address the needs of its young generation, the largest in the countrys history, whose views reflect a deep disillusionment with government and democracy, according to a report released here yesterday.         
	The report, commissioned by the British Council and conducted by the Nielsen research company, drew a picture of a deeply frustrated young generation that feels abandoned by its government and despondent about its future.        
	An overwhelming majority of young Pakistanis say their country is headed in the wrong direction, the report said, and only 1 in 10 has confidence in the government. Most see themselves as Muslim first and Pakistani second, and they are now entering a work force in which the lions share cannot find jobs, a potentially volatile situation if the government cannot address its concerns.        
	This is a real wake-up call for the international community, said David Steven, a fellow at the Center for International Cooperation at New York University, who was an adviser on the report. You could get rapid social and economic change. But the other route will lead to a nightmare that would unfold over 20 to 30 years.        
	The population has risen by almost half in just 20 years, a pace that is double the world average, according to the report.        
	The despair among the young generation is rooted in the condition of their lives, the report found. Only a fifth of those interviewed had permanent full-time jobs. Half said they did not have sufficient skills to enter the workplace. And one in four could not read or write, a legacy of the countrys abysmal public education system, in which less than 40 per cent of children are enrolled in school, far below the South Asian average of 58 per cent.        
	While most do not trust their government, they attach their loyalty to religion. Three-quarters identified themselves primarily as Muslim, with just one in seven identifying themselves as Pakistani.         
	The demographic power of this generation represents a turning point for Pakistan. Its energy, if properly harnessed, could power an economic rise, as was the case in many East Asian countries in the 1990s, Steven said in a telephone interview.         
	But if the opportunity is squandered by insufficient investment in areas like education and health care, the country will face a demographic disaster, the report said.         
	To avoid that, the authors calculated that Pakistans economy would need to grow by 36 million jobs in the next decade  about a quarter the size of the US economy  an enormous challenge in an economy that is growing by about a million jobs a year.

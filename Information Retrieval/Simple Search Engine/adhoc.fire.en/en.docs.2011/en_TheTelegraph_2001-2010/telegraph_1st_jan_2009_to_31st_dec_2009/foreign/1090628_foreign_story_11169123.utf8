                                                                                                               $1.6 million for lunch with Buffet
                            
	New York, June 26 (Reuters): A bidder agreed to pay $1.68 million for a steak lunch with billionaire investor Warren Buffett in a charity auction completed last night, according to eBays website where the bidding took place.        
	The winning bid in the 10th annual fundraiser fell short of last years record $2.11 million, paid by Hong Kong-based investor Zhao Danyang. The starting price was $25,000. The identity of the winning bidder could not immediately be determined.         
	As in recent years, the winner and up to seven friends may dine with the worlds second-richest person at the Smith amp; Wollensky steakhouse in New York. Zhao had his lunch with Buffett on Wednesday.

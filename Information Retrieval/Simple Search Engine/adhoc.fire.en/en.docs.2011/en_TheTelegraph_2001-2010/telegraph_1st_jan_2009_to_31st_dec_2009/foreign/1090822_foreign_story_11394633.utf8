The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Ex-UBS banker turned informant sentenced
                                                                                                               Ex-UBS banker turned informant sentenced
                              Bradley Birkenfeld in Fort Lauderdale, Florida. (AP)                            
	Fort Lauderdale (Florida), Aug. 21 (Reuters): A former UBS banker and key informant in the US tax evasion case against Swiss bank UBS AG was sentenced to three years and four months in prison today for helping a billionaire hide assets from US tax authorities.        
	The sentence for Bradley Birkenfeld, handed down by federal Judge William Zloch in a Fort Lauderdale court, was harsher than his attorney and prosecutors had expected.        
	Citing Birkenfelds cooperation in the US government tax evasion investigation of UBS, prosecutors had asked that his sentence be reduced to two-and-a-half years in prison from the five years he had originally faced.        
	His lawyers had pleaded for probation, which would have kept Birkenfeld, a 44-year-old US citizen, out of jail.        
	Birkenfeld was sentenced for conspiring to defraud the US by helping a billionaire real estate developer create sham corporations and entities to hide $200 million in assets from US tax authorities.        
	But he had been credited with providing information in a sweeping US investigation of UBS over its private banking business, involving wealthy Americans who used their Swiss bank accounts to hide money overseas to evade taxes.        
	His sentencing, delayed four times since it was originally set for August last year, came two days after US and Swiss authorities signed a pact in which Switzerland agreed to reveal the names of about 4,450 wealthy American clients of UBS to US tax investigators.        
	Birkenfelds defence attorney, David Meier, called the prison sentence disappointing but said his client would continue to work with US investigators.        
	Birkenfeld, who has admitted to once smuggling a customers diamonds into the US in a toothpaste tube, appeared in the wood-panelled courtroom in a grey pinstripe suit, blue shirt and red tie.        
	Appealing for leniency, his attorney Meier said Birkenfeld had helped US authorities uncover a massive tax fraud scheme involving UBS. He asked for five-years probation for Birkenfeld.         
	The world of international taxes has drastically changed, Meier said, citing statements by US Internal Revenue Service officials who said that Wednesdays Swiss-US agreement was prising open Switzerlands jealously guarded bank secrecy.

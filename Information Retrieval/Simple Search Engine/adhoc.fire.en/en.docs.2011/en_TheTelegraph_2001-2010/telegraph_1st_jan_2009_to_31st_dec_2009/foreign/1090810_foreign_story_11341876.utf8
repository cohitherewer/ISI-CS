	Colombo, Aug. 9 (Reuters): The political allies of the defeated Tamil Tigers won the most seats at local elections in a northern town, while the ruling coalition sailed to victory at local and provincial polls, results showed today.        
	Yesterdays polls, one each for local councillors in the northern towns of Jaffna and Vavuniya, were the first since the government crushed the LTTE in May.        
	In Vavuniya, the Tamil National Alliances Ilanghai Tamil Arasu Kachchi party won five of 11 seats on the municipal council. The Tamil National Alliance is a coalition of LTTE supporters.

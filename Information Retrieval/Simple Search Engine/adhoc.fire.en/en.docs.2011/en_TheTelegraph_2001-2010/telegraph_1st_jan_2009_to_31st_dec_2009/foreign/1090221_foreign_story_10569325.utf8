	No sex in library    
	 Topeka (Kansas), Feb. 20 (AP): The public library in Topeka, Kansas, is restricting access to four books about sex.       
	The public librarys Board of Trustees voted last night to prevent minors from having access to the books after reviewing a complaint about their availability in the public stacks with other health books. Topeka resident Kim Borchers called them harmful to minors.      
	The books are The Joy of Sex, The Lesbian Kama Sutra, Joy of Gay Sex and Sex for Busy People: The Art of the Quickie for Lovers on the Go.    
	Legal mice    
	 West Palm Beach, Florida (AP): There are so many mice in one Florida county courthouse that theyve been seen falling from ceiling tiles. One judge at the Palm Beach County Courthouse told The Palm Beach Post newspaper that its an infestation. Some staffers say they check their handbags for stowaways before leaving the building each day.      
	 Court employees and lawyers say the rodents scuttle down      
	corridors, munch legal papers and scratch behind the walls. Last week, one mouse ran around a courtroom floor for an hour during a burglary trial.

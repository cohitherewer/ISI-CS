	Washington, June 17: President Barack Obama swatted and killed a fly during an interview with CNBC.         
	President Obama displayed impressive hand-eye coordination during the interview with John Harwood. After killing the fly, he declared: That was pretty impressive, wasnt it? I got the sucker.         
	As Obama started to respond to a question from the interviewer he became distracted by a fly buzzing around his head and started to laugh.         
	He then watched the fly in silence as it landed on top of his hand before swatting it and killing it with the other. The President then turned to Harwood to ask: Now, where were we?        
	As the fly lay dead on the floor he pointed to it and suggested the crew film it, amid much laughter from the shows host and the production crew. You wanna film that, he said. There it is.         
	The President is already being called Obamzilla and fly-killing badass by the US media. During the rest of the interview Obama discussed the economy, Iran, his healthcare plan and the media scrutiny he has faced since he came to power.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Best neighbours: the Obamas
                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      Best neighbours: the Obamas

	Los Angeles, Dec. 29 (Reuters): Americans would most like to live next door to the Obama family. But a reality star like Californias Octomom, or Jon and Kate Gosselin and their brood of eight would be a big turn off, according to a poll released today.        
	President Barack Obama, his wife Michelle and daughters Malia and Sasha, came top of a poll that asked Americans who would be their most desirable celebrity neighbour.        
	The US first family were followed by TV chat show host Ellen DeGeneres and her partner Portia de Rossi, who tied with Republican Sarah Palin, in the poll by online real estate marketplace Zillow.com.        
	But, as in life, families with large broods were deemed the worst likely neighbours. Nadya Suleman, the California single mom who this year added octuplets to her existing brood of six children, topped the worst celebrity neighbour poll with 17 per cent of votes.        
	Suleman, dubbed Octomom by the US media, was followed by recently divorced reality TV stars Jon and Kate Gosselin and their eight kids.        
	In a reflection of her tendency to polarise Americans, Sarah Palin, the former Republican vice-presidential contender who has five children, also came third in the worst neighbours list with 11 per cent of votes.        
	Americans have made it clear that they think politicians and talk show hosts make the best neighbours, said Amy Bohutinsky, Zillow.com vice-president of communications. Apparently Americans are opposed to living next door to a brood of young children, particularly those that come with a TV crew.

          COLIN FREEMAN                          Dylan: Odour rights                                  
	London, March 18: Folk singer and civil rights campaigner Bob Dylan is facing a protest in his own backyard after neighbours complained about a noxious portable toilet in the grounds of his California home.         
	Dylan, 67, who had the 1963 hit Blowin in the wind, is under investigation by public health officials over whiffs emanating from a lavatory used by security guards at his cliffside compound at Point Dune, Malibu.         
	One couple, David and Cindy Emminger, claim the singer has ignored repeated requests to deal with the problem, forcing them to install five industrial-sized fans to divert the smell.         
	They claim that even the fans have not had the desired effect, as the Pacific breeze that sweeps across the area forces the odours back in their direction. Its a scandal  Mr Civil Rights is killing our civil rights, said Emminger.

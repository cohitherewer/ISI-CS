	Sydney, Feb. 7 (Reuters): Australian bushfires killed at least 14 people in the southern state of Victoria today as a heatwave sparked more than 40 blazes across the state and neighbouring New South Wales, police said.        
	Victorias deputy police commissioner Kieran Walshe said all the deaths were in a massive fire 80km north of Melbourne in rural towns  six at Kinglake, four at nearby Wandong, three at Strathewen and one in Clonbinane.        
	The six killed in Kinglake were all in the same car, Walshe told reporters. This is an absolute tragedy for the state and we believe the figure may even get worse, said Walshe.        
	We base that on the fact were only just getting into these areas now ... to search buildings ... the figure could get into the 40s, he said.        
	The Victorian bushfire had burnt some 3,000 hectares of mainly national park earlier today, before it flared in the afternoon when a cool southerly change hit with strong winds fanning the fire into local towns. Within hours the fire had burnt some 30,000 hectares, said local media.        
	Australias worst bushfires occurred in 1983 when 75 people were killed in Victoria.

                              Klum: Balloon help                            
	New York, July 20 (PTI): Supermodel Heidi Klums neighbours came to her rescue after the German beauty who was in a park with her children was surrounded by paparazzi.        
	The Victorias Secret model, who is expecting her fourth child, was at the centre of a paparazzi swarm when some of her neighbours, who too were there with their children, asked the photographers to leave the family in peace.        
	When they refused to budge, the parents asked their children to gang up and pelt them with water balloons, reports the New York Post.        
	The ensuing chaos allowed the model to leave the park without being followed by the pack of photographers.        
	The 36-year-old recently insisted that she isnt worried about gaining weight during her pregnancy. Im not worried. I know my body will go back again, the model had said.

	Healthy Cindy    
	 London, Oct. 28 (PTI): Former supermodel Cindy Crawford has expressed concern over the current trend of size-zero models.      
	 for her trademark mole just above her lip, Crawford believes that she is too healthy to fit in the category of supermodel today. I would not have become a supermodel in 2009. I look too healthy, Crawford said.      
	The former beauty queen was one of the best paid models during the 1990s. Crawford added that a body like her own with big breasts, normal thighs and toned upper arms is no longer what the industry is looking for.

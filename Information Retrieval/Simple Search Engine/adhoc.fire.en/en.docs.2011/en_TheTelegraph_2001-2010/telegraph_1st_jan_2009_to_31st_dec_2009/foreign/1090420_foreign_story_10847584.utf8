	Designer purse    
	 New Hampshire, April 19: A US designer has created purses disguised to look like flowers, stones and even a cactus.      
	Kathleen Dustin, who creates the accessories from clay, said they are designed for women who are confident about their style.      
	Dustin, from New Hampshire in America, said she had drawn her inspiration from observations made throughout her life.      
	She said: The imagery of my work comes from taking a deep look at my life, responding to it, and expressing it so that it strikes a chord in someone else too, encouraging them to pay attention.      
	Ive been paying attention to elements in the woods such as seed pods, buds, moss, grasses, leaves, sticks and stones.

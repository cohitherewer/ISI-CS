The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Korea says it has tested nuke device
                                                                                                               Korea says it has tested nuke device
          CHOE SANG-HUN                              
	Seoul, May 25: North Korea announced today that it had successfully conducted its second nuclear test, defying international warnings and dramatically raising the stakes in a global effort to persuade the recalcitrant communist state to give up its weapons programme.        
	The Norths official news agency, KCNA, said: The Democratic Peoples Republic of Korea successfully conducted one more underground nuclear test on May 25 as part of the measures to bolster up its nuclear deterrent for self-defence in every way as requested by its scientists and technicians.         
	The test was safely conducted on a new higher level in terms of its explosive power and technology of its control, the agency said. The results of the test helped satisfactorily settle the scientific and technological problems arising in further increasing the power of nuclear weapons and steadily developing nuclear technology.        
	The test appeared to have caught South Korea and the US off guard, and the news hit just as South Koreas government and people were mourning the suicide of former President Roh Moo-hyun.         
	Hours after the test was reported, South Koreas Yonhap news agency, quoting an unidentified intelligence source in Seoul, said the North had test-fired three short-range, surface-to-air missiles. The three missiles were launched toward the sea between North Korea and Japan and had a range of 80 miles, according to the news agency. They were fired from a base not far from the nuclear test site in northeast North Korea, Yonhap said.         
	President Obama reacted swiftly to the nuclear test, warning the North to retreat from its defiance of the international community.        
	Today, North Korea said that it has conducted a nuclear test in violation of international law, Obama said in a statement early today. It appears to also have attempted a short-range missile launch. These actions, while not a surprise given its statements and actions to date, are a matter of grave concern to all nations. North Koreas attempts to develop nuclear weapons, as well as its ballistic missile programme, constitute a threat to international peace and security.        
	By acting in blatant defiance of the UN Security Council, North Korea is directly and recklessly challenging the international community. North Koreas behaviour increases tensions and undermines stability in northeast Asia. Such provocations will only serve to deepen North Koreas isolation. It will not find international acceptance unless it abandons its pursuit of weapons of mass destruction and their means of delivery, the statement said.        
	China said it was resolutely opposed to the test, Xinhua news agency reported. Geological authorities in the US reported that the Norths test triggered an earth tremor with a magnitude of between 4.5 and 5.3. The tremor emanated from Kilju, the same area where the North Korea carried out a test in 2006.

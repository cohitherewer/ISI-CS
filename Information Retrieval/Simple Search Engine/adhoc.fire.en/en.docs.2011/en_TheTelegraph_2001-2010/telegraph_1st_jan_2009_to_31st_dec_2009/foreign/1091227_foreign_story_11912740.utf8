	Aspen (Colorado), Dec. 26: Hollywood star Charlie Sheen spent Christmas Day in jail after he was arrested for alleged domestic violence.        
	Sheen, 44, the star of television comedy Two and a Half Men, was taken into custody early on Christmas morning by officers responding to an emergency call from a house in the upmarket ski resort town of Aspen, Colorado. An ambulance went to the house but nobody was taken to hospital.        
	The actor was taken to the Pitkin County jail and booked for investigation of second-degree assault and menacing, both felonies, along with criminal mischief, a misdemeanour, Aspen police spokeswoman Stephanie Dasaro said.        
	 He was released in the late afternoon after posting a $8,500 bond and being advised by a county judge on the conditions of his release, she said. Dasaro declined to name Sheens accuser, citing a department policy prohibiting the identification of victims in domestic violence cases.        
	Aspen attorney Richard Cummins said late yesterday that he was representing Sheen in the case. He declined to name Sheens accuser or discuss details, but he cautioned against any rush to judgment. I think at the end of the day it will be much ado about nothing, Cummins said.

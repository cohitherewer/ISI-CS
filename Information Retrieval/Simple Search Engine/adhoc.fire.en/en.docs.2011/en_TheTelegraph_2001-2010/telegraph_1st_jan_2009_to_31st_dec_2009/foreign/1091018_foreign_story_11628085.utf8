                              Polanski                            
	Geneva, Oct. 17 (Reuters): Director Roman Polanski, arrested in Switzerland three weeks ago to face extradition in a US sex case, has been moved from jail for medical treatment, his French lawyer said today.        
	All I know is that he has been taken from prison for medical attention. I dont know where he is or when he will be returned to prison, French lawyer Herve Temime said. He added that he did not have any other details.        
	Temime said last week after visiting Polanski in a Zurich jail that he was depressed and tired and expressed concern about his medical condition. Polanski, 76, was arrested in relation to the US case involving sex with an underage girl dating back over 30 years when he arrived in Switzerland last month.

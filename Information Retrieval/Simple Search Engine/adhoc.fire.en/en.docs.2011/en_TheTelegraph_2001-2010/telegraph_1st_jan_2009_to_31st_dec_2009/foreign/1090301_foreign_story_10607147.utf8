The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Saudi prince humbled by US boost in Citi stake
                                                                                                               Saudi prince humbled by US boost in Citi stake
          LANDON THOMAS JR. AND ERIC DASH                          Prince Walid bin Talal                                  
	London, Feb. 28: The bad news arrived by telephone early this week at the Saudi headquarters of Prince Walid bin Talal.         
	Citigroup, the investment that had transformed Prince Walid from an obscure Arabian royal into the Warren E. Buffett of West Asia, was spiralling down around him.        
	And now, on the line from New York, was Citigroups chief executive, calling personally to tell the prince that the US government would substantially increase its stake in the troubled financial company  a step that would cost the prince dearly.         
	As it did yesterday. The stunning collapse of Citigroups share price, to a mere $1.50 yesterday from a record $55 in 2006, has hurt investors worldwide. But few reputations have suffered as severe a blow as that of Prince Walid, who owns about 4 per cent of the company.        
	In its third attempt to stabilise Citigroup, the government announced yesterday that it would increase its ownership stake to as much as 36 per cent by converting part of its large preferred investment stake to common stock, Other preferred stockholders could own a 38 per cent stake of the bank if they all convert their shares. That would dilute existing common shareholders, who together would now own just 26 per cent of the bank.         
	Those investors include Prince Walid, who injected close to $600 million into Citigroups predecessor, Citibank, when it was foundering in 1991. At the time, the price of $10  $2.98, adjusted for stock splits  seemed a bargain.         
	But Prince Walid and several other investors from West Asia and Asia, including the Abu Dhabi investment fund, are now suffering the public embarrassment of seeing their investments in Citigroup evaporate.        
	 With their ties to the royal families of their respective countries  Prince Walid is the grandson of Saudi Arabias founding king, Abdul-Aziz Ibn Saud, and the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority invests the surplus cash of Abu Dhabis kingdom  these two investors are among the worlds most influential.         
	Now they must decide whether to lose their preferred investor status and join the investor rank and file as common equity holders alongside the US government. Prince Walid, similar to other large holders of preferred shares like the government of Singapore, has said he will exchange his preferred stock for common shares.        
	But the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority has not agreed to the deal and is looking to solicit a legal opinion to assess its options, people briefed on the funds thinking said. A spokesman for the fund declined to comment.        
	That the investment authority finds itself in such a position is not without irony. When Abu Dhabi invested in Citigroup, an uproar was raised that this stake represented the first stage of a creeping influence by government-owned investment funds over American financial companies. Now, it is the US government that is, in effect, taking over, leaving Abu Dhabi in a lurch.        
	Indeed, if the Abu Dhabi fund were to convert its shares, it would forgo the 11 per cent interest it is now paid quarterly and lose dependable cash flow at a time  with oil prices low and its neighbouring emirate Dubai in a dire economic condition  when the demands for capital at home have never been higher.        
	For Prince Walid, the developments at Citigroup are a stinging embarrassment. In November, he made a public splash by increasing his Citigroup stake, thus becoming its largest shareholder.        
	Asked in an interview on CNBC if he could foresee Citigroup requiring additional government money, and if he would invest again, the prince responded with his typical flair.         
	I believe this is a very far- fetched situation, he said, saying that in his many conversations with Mr Vikram, as he called Vikram S. Pandit, Citigroups chief executive, he had been assured that the bank would have enough capital for the next 12 to 18 months.

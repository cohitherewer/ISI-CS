	Lohan night    
	London (PTI): Actress Lindsay Lohan was seen leaving actor and producer Jason Segels home on Sunday morning, reports the Daily Mail. Segel denied that Lohan had stayed over, but just an hour later, the 23-year-old star emerged from his house. Unluckily for the actress, the paparazzi had not been deterred by Segels insistence that she was not there and her oversized sunglasses were not quite enough to disguise her face.

	Madonna mission    
	 London, Sept. 29 (PTI): Singer and actress Madonna seems to have found husband number three in model Jesus Luz as the star is reportedly getting ready to marry him.      
	The 51-year-old singer is planning to defy critics of her nine-month relationship with the Brazilian model, who is only 29 years of age, by tying the knot by the end of the year, reports the Daily Mail.      
	The extraordinary claim was made by Madonnas biographer Randy Taraborrelli in Hello! magazine.      
	 Hes so sweet. He checks in with me all the time. I probably should do the same, but you know me. I think he gets it now that Im a little, shall we say, self-involved, Madonna reportedly said of Luz.

	New York, March 20: Vanessa Redgrave sang a sweet lullaby to her daughter Natasha Richardson in the final moments of her life.         
	The 72-year-old had stroked her daughters face as she sang Edelweiss, the melody from The Sound Of Music. Richardson died in a New York hospital surrounded by her mother, husband Liam Neeson and sister Joely Richardson following her skiing accident at Mont Tremblant in Canada.        
	Shortly after, relatives made the decision to switch off the life-support machine.         
	Edelweiss is the same song that Redgrave performed for her daughters first marriage to Robert Fox in 1990, it was reported in the Daily Mail.        
	Last night, luminaries from screen and stage paid tribute to the actress while the lights of Broadway were dimmed for a minute in her honour. She died two days after an seemingly minor fall on Monday on a beginners ski slope at the Mont Tremblant resort in Canada.

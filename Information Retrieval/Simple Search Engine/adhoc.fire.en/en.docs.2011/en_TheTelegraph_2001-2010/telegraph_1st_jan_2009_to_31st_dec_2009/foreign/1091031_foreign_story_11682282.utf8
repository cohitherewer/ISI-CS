	Arise, Sir Dracula    
	 London, Oct. 30: Dracula star Sir Christopher Lee was knighted by the Prince of Wales and hailed the Hammer horror movies that made his name, reports The Daily Telegraph.      
	The prolific actor, famed for his spine-chilling roles as Count Dracula, said he would always be grateful to the studio that made his name.      
	Lee, who was knighted by Prince Charles at a Buckingham Palace investiture ceremony, has appeared in more than 250 films and television productions and was honoured for services to drama and to charity.      
	Talking about his days with the Hammer Horror studios in the 1950s and 1960s Lee said: Ive always been grateful for the opportunity to play characters, it happened to be for that company which made me not always a face but a name all over the world which was extremely important at that time.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Qaida faces funds crisis
                                                                                                               Qaida faces funds crisis
                            
	London, Oct. 13: The al Qaida is in its worst financial state for many years while the Talibans funding is growing, the US treasury has said.        
	David Cohen, a terrorist financing official, said the al Qaida had made several appeals for funds this year. He said that as well as cash flow problems, the influence of the network  damaged by US efforts to choke funding  was waning. The Taliban, meanwhile, was in better financial shape, bolstered by Afghanistans booming trade in drugs.        
	 Cohen said the Qaida leadership had warned that a lack of funds was hurting the groups recruitment and training efforts. We assess that al Qaida is in its weakest financial condition in several years and that, as a result, its influence is waning, Cohen told the BBC from Washington. But he added that as the organisation had multiple donors who were ready, willing and able to contribute the situation could be rapidly reversed.        
	The Taliban were in a better financial position, he said, despite efforts to restrict the movements cash supply. The US administrations special envoy to Afghanistan, Richard Holbrooke, has said that the Taliban get most of their funding from private benefactors in the Gulf.

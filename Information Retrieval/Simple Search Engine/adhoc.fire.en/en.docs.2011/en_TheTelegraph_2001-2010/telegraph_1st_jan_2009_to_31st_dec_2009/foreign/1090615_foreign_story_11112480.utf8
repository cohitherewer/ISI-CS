	Tehran, June 14 (AP): Iranian protesters set fires and smashed store windows today in a second day of violence as groups challenging President Mahmoud Ahmadinejads re-election tried to keep pressure on authorities.        
	Anti-riot police lashed back and the regime blocked Internet sites used to rally the pro-reform campaign.        
	Ahmadinejad dismissed Tehrans worst unrest in a decade as not important, comparing it to passions after a football match. He insisted Fridays vote was real and free and the results showing his landslide victory were fair and legitimate. Along Tehrans Vali Asr street, tens of thousands marched in support of Ahmadinejad, waving Iranian flags and shouting his name.        
	Rival candidate Mir Hossein Mousavi sent a letter to the Guardian Council  a powerful clerical group  calling for the election to be cancelled.         
	Fraud is evident and review and nullification is requested, said the letter posted on Mousavis website. Mousavi met Irans supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei to discuss his fraud allegations.         
	Mousavi urged supporters to continue their civil and lawful opposition to the results and advised the police to stop violence against protesters.        
	Irans government have deployed anti-riot squads around the capital and cut mobile phone messaging and Internet sites used by Mousavis campaign.        
	Today, scores of young people shouted Death to the dictator! and broke the windows of city buses on several streets in central Tehran. They burned banks and set fire to trash bins and piles of tires, using them as flaming barricades to block the police.        
	Riot police beat some of the protesters with batons while dozens of others holding shields stood guard nearby. Shops, government offices and businesses closed early as tension mounted.        
	Ahmadinejad called the level of violence not important from my point of view, speaking at a news conference.        
	The police have detained more than 100 reformers. Mohammad Reza Khatami, the brother of former President Mohammad Khatami, was also detained but was released today.

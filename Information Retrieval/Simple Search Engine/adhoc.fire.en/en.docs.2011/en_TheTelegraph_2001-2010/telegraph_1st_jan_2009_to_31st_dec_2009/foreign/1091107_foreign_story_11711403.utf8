	Orlando (Florida), Nov. 6 (AP): A gunman opened fire today in the offices of an engineering firm from which he was sacked more than two years ago, killing one person and injuring five others.        
	Jason Rodriguez, 40, surrendered to police about three hours later, after officers saw him through the window of his mothers home and asked him to come outside, Orlando police chief Val Demings said. The Florida shooting comes a day after a gunman at the Fort Hood military base in Texas killed 13 people and wounded about 30.         
	 Demings said investigators did not know why Rodriguez targeted the engineering firm where he once worked. This is a tragedy no doubt about it, especially on the heels of the tragedy in Fort Hood that is on our minds, she said. Im just glad we dont have any more fatalities or any more injuries than we currently have.        
	People streamed out of the 16-storey Legion Place office building around lunchtime and some told local television stations they had barricaded themselves inside their offices while the gunman was on the loose.        
	Mike Bernof, a spokesman for Reynolds Smith amp; Hill, the transportation engineering consulting firm where Rodriguez was an engineer, told CNN Rodriguez was released in June 2007 for performance issues.         
	He could not say what those issues were. The firm performs transportation engineering work for the Florida department of transportation. Gerry Gilgo, who works on the floor where the shooting occurred, said she was meeting a co-worker at the elevators for lunch. She yelled, There are gunshots! There are gunshots! Get back in your office, Gilgo said.

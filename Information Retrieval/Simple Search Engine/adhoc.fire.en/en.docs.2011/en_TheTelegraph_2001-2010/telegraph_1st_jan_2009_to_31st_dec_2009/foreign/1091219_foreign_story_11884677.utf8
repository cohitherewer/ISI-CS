          MURRAY WARDROP                          Alba: Golden ratio                                  
	London, Dec. 18: Beauty is not so much in the eye of the beholder as in the measurements between a womans eyes, mouth and ears, scientists claim.        
	Researchers have calculated the ratios of the perfect face and claim that celebrities including Jessica Alba, Liz Hurley and Shania Twain have the magic formula. While being labelled average is rarely regarded as a compliment, they also found that the golden ratio matched dimensions of an average womans face.        
	 But for those not blessed with textbook looks, there is still hope  experts who conducted the research said women can bend the rules through a haircut. They can also take encouragement from the fact that Angelina Jolie, the actress, does not fit their beauty criteria.        
	Prof. Kang Lee, from the University of Toronto, said: We already know that different facial features make a female face attractive  large eyes, for example, or full lips. Our study proves that the structure of faces also contributes top our perception of facial attractiveness.        
	In four experiments, US and Canadian researchers asked students to compare colour photographs of womens faces. In one photograph, the vertical distance between the eyes and mouth, and the horizontal distance between the eyes of each woman had been doctored. In the other, the eyes, mouth, nose, contour and hairline remained unchanged.        
	The participants were then asked to select the face they found more attractive. In all four experiments, they chose the faces with specific proportions that researchers have dubbed call the golden ratio.

	Glendale (California), Sept. 4: More than two months after he died, and following a steady trickle of gossip over how and where he would be laid to rest, Michael Jackson was entombed last night at a highly guarded mausoleum in a Los Angeles suburb.        
	About 200 people, including Elizabeth Taylor, Lisa Marie Presley, Macaulay Culkin, Quincy Jones and many other celebrities, attended the nearly 90-minute ceremony behind the gates of the heavily guarded Forest Lawn cemetery here.        
	With closed streets, nervous guards, restricted airspace over the grounds and family and friends arriving in a multi-vehicle motorcade, the proceedings took on the feel of a presidential visit. Small clusters of fans of Jackson gathered at blockaded streets around the cemetery, with one group unfurling a large white banner that read, in part, Gone too soon.

	London, Dec. 14: The Welsh actress, Catherine Zeta Jones, proved the missing ingredient last night when Trevor Nunns latest production opened on Broadway, reports The Daily Telegraph.    
	The opening marked Zeta Joness debut on the American stage. Zeta Jones, 40, and Lansbury, 84, who was making her 13th Broadway appearance, threw themselves with barely disguised glee into their roles as the touring actress Desiree Armfeldt and her formidable mother, Madame Armfeldt.

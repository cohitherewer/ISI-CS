	Costly Leo snub    
	 New York, June 30 (PTI): Actor Leonardo DiCaprio snubbed a group of Japanese fans during a recent trip to Japan and they took revenge on the star by stealing his shoes.      
	The Titanic star was left bare-footed and red-faced after fans ran off with his shoes during a visit to an ancient temple, reported the New York Post.      
	The Titanic star was sightseeing in the country and joined a group of fellow Americans on a trip to a hilltop temple in Kyoto. He upset some local fans by refusing to pose for photographs with them. When the 34-year-old star took off his trainers to step inside the temple the fans ran off with them.

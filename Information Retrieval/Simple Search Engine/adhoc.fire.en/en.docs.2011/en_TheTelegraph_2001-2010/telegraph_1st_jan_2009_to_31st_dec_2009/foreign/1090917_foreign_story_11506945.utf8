The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Pandit to fly regular flights
                                                                                                               Pandit to fly regular flights
                              Pandit: Austerity drive                            
	New York, Sept. 16 (Reuters): Citigroup Incs CEO may soon get re-acquainted with flight delays, long security lines and aisle seats  at least when it comes to personal trips.        
	Vikram Pandit may have to resort to regular commercial flights after the bank said on its website that the chief executive would stop using its New York banks corporate jets for personal trips.        
	Pandits decision to forego personal use of the corporate jet came as Citi and other banks that were bailed out by taxpayers met a deadline this week to supply the government with its rules on luxury expenses. The use of corporate jets has become a symbol of corporate excess after the chiefs of embattled US automakers used them to travel to Washington to ask for bailouts.        
	 Citi scrapped plans in January to buy a $50 million jet that politicians called wasteful.        
	According to the policy filed with the government and posted on Citis website, personal use by Citi executives is not permitted except in emergencies and with the written permission of the CEO. Citi, Bank of America Corp and Wells Fargo amp; Co will continue to allow employees to use corporate jets for business travel. However, executive-level signoffs are required at Citi and Wells Fargo.

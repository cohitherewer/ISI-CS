	 London, June 1: A glass of wine a day can cut the risk of developing gallstones by a third, a new study has shown.       
	Researchers from the University of East Anglia, Norwich, studied the diets of 25,639 people over 10 years. During that time 267 of the volunteers developed gallstones.      
	Those who consumed two units of alcohol a day saw their chances of developing gallstones fall by one third. Every unit drunk a week cut the chances by 3 per cent.

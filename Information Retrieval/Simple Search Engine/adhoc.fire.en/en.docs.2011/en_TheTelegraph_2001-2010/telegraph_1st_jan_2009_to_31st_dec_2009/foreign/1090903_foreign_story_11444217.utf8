	Islamabad, Sept. 2 (Reuters): Unidentified gunmen shot and wounded Pakistans religious affairs minister, Hamid Saeed Kazmi, in a brazen attack in the capital today that killed his driver, officials said.        
	Kazmi, a cleric and vocal opponent of the Taliban, belongs to the Barelvi sect, whose moderate adherents of Islamic sufi mysticism venerate saints and their shrines.        
	We have been receiving threats because we are against terrorism, we are against Taliban, we are against Baitullah Mehsud, we are against suicide attacks, said Kazmis brother, Mazhar Saeed Kazmi.        
	The attackers struck as the minister was leaving his office. I was standing outside our office when I saw two gunmen escaping on a motorcycle, Iqbal Siddiqui, a ministry official, said.        
	Local television news channels showed images of Kazmi with what appeared to be a leg wound. Khalid Hussain, a doctor at Islamabads Federal Government Services Hospital, said Kazmi was in a stable condition.        
	The Pakistani army launched a campaign in April to clear the Taliban from Swat and Buner, two valleys a few hours drive from Islamabad, and has since bottled up the main militant stronghold in South Waziristan.        
	The army says it has killed more than 2,000 militants and lost 312 soldiers in Swat since the campaign began. Independent casualty estimates are unavailable.        
	There had been expectations the Taliban would respond with attacks in cities, but todays assassination attempt was the first of note since a suicide bomber killed nine people at the top hotel in Peshawar in June.

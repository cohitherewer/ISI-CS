The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Namesake of criminal stripped at airport
                                                                                                               Namesake of criminal stripped at airport
                            
	Toronto, June 15 (PTI): A Canadian woman was forced to strip at Montreal airport by border agents who wanted to check for a pink tattoo on her backside after her name and date of birth matched that of a wanted criminal.        
	Sylvie Menard, who has no history of trouble with the law, flew home after a relaxing Mexico vacation in April to a disastrous encounter with airport authorities.        
	Menard, manager of a wine business, is still seeking an explanation why she was handcuffed and locked up, then told to undress, the Toronto Star reported.        
	The 43-year-old said after being questioned by an airport customs official she was pulled aside. Her luggage was tested for drug residue and her name was run through a computer. Next, a border officer read out her rights, handcuffed her and led her to a cell. I was really stressed, she said. As far as Menard can tell, her name matched that of a suspected criminal with the same birth date.        
	Menard says it felt like a bad dream when a female border officer asked her to expose her buttocks to see if she had a pink tattoo, like her namesake. The officer later made her disrobe again to check if one had been erased with a laser.

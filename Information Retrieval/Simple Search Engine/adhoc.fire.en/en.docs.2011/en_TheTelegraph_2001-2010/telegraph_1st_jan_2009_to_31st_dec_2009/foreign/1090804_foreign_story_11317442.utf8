The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Critics snub Ahmadinejad ceremony

	Beirut, Aug. 3: With his adversaries facing a mass trial of more than 100 alleged dissidents, President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad was formally endorsed today as Irans leader for a second term. But several of his most prominent opponents, who have called his re-election fraudulent, stayed away from the event, news reports said.        
	The ceremony, conducted by the supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, came one day after state television broadcast a chilling segment of the mass trial in which two defendants  both prominent reform figures  said they had changed since being arrested, and disputed widespread claims that their publicised confessions had been coerced through torture.        
	Ahmadinejads formal endorsement at a ceremony in Tehran today was a pre-requisite to his inauguration on Wednesday.         
	Ayatollah Khamenei had already given public support to Ahmadinejads landslide victory in elections on June 12 that opposition supporters say was rigged.         
	The main legislative body in charge of elections, the Guardian Council, has also endorsed it as fair.        
	News reports said that several leading opponents of Ahmadinejad stayed away from the ceremony today, including the main reformist candidate, Mir Hussein Moussavi and an Opposition ally, Mehdi Karroubi.         
	Opposition leaders have also hinted that they will stay away from the inauguration later in the week.        
	Two former Presidents who have criticised the election, Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani and Mohammad Khatami, also boycotted todays event, news reports said.        
	But Press TV said leaders of the three branches of government attended the formal endorsement, including Mohsen Rezai, an unsuccessful conservative presidential candidate who had previously challenged the outcome of the elections. At the mass trial yesterday, a Tehran prosecutor, Saeed Mortazavi, who is running the hearings, released a statement warning that anyone criticising them as illegitimate, as many Opposition figures have done, would also be prosecuted.        
	The two steps reflected an intensified effort to intimidate Irans opposition movement before President Ahmadinejads inauguration.         
	The broadcast of part of the trial yesterday was a deliberate provocation to Opposition leaders, who had singled out the use of televised confessions as an especially appalling tactic.         
	The two men who appeared were Muhammad Ali Abtahi, a former vice-president and blogger, and Muhammad Atrianfar, a former deputy interior minister.        
	An alleged confession by Abtahi was at the core of the ccusations levelled by prosecutors on Saturday, in which they took aim at virtually every figure associated with reform in Iran, and many others abroad.        
	 Abtahi was quoted as saying that the Oppositions claims of a stolen election were false, and that Opposition leaders had conspired in advance to misrepresent the vote. Such confessions are almost always obtained under duress, according to human rights groups.

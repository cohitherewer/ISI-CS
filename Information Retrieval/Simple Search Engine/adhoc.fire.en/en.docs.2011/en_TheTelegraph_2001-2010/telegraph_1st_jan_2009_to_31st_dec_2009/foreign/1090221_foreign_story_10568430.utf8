The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | UBS pressed for 52,000 names in probe
                                                                                                               UBS pressed for 52,000 names in probe

	New York, Feb. 20: The UBS memo was blunt: the Swiss solution could help affluent Americans.        
	That message, sent to the banks executives in July 2004, referred to a UBS plan to help rich customers evade taxes by hiding money in offshore havens like the Bahamas.         
	The memo, along with dozens of email messages like it, were disclosed yesterday in a blistering court document filed by the justice department, which sought to compel UBS, based in Switzerland, to divulge the identities of 52,000 Americans whom the authorities suspect of using secret offshore accounts at the bank to dodge taxes.         
	The move opened a new, unexpected front against UBS, which a day earlier had agreed to pay $780 million to settle claims that it defrauded the Internal Revenue Service, and against Switzerlands long tradition of banking secrecy.         
	The number of clients the authorities are seeking to identify is far higher than previously believed, raising new questions about the scale of UBSs activities and the number of Americans who could be snared in the investigation.         
	Federal authorities initially focused on 19,000 accounts, and UBS turned over about 250 names on Wednesday. That figure now seems certain to grow.         
	The court document alone dealt a stinging blow to UBS, whose corps of private bankers discreetly tend the fortunes of billionaires and multimillionaires. Filed in a Miami court, the papers provide a rare inside look at the secretive ways of Swiss banking.         
	The 2004 memorandum, for instance, described how UBS created hundreds of dummy offshore corporations where its clients could hide money from the IRS.         
	An email message sent that year captured some of the coded language used by UBS bankers. In their world, one nut meant $250,000, while one swan meant $1 million. Colours were used to designate certain currencies. Orange, for example, represented the euro; blue, the British pound.         
	Several messages described UBS actively referring clients to outside lawyers and accountants in Switzerland and elsewhere who set up secret accounts for them.         
	In a brief interview yesterday, one UBS client said the bank also provided wealthy clients with electronic devices with coded computer chips that enabled them to gain access to their accounts and transfer money secretly. The passwords changed each time the accounts were accessed.        
	In the criminal investigation that led to this weeks settlement, the justice department had zeroed in on about 19,000 wealthy Americans. Those UBS customers had a combined $20 billion in assets at the bank, and may have evaded $300 million a year in federal taxes through UBSs undeclared offshore private banking services.        
	But the IRS has been conducting a parallel investigation, and yesterday the justice department asked a federal judge to require UBS to disclose to the IRS the identities and records of the 52,000 clients. In the past, UBS has suggested that the 19,000 accounts under investigation, which it is now closing, were the extent of its undeclared offshore banking services.

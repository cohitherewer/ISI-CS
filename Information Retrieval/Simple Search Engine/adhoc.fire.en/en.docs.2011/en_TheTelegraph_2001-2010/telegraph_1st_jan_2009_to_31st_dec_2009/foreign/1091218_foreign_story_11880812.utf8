	Rio de Janeiro, Dec. 17 (AP): A two-year-old boy with more than 40 sewing needles stuck in him is being airlifted to another hospital in northeastern Brazil because two of the needles are close to his heart, an official said today.        
	A police official, meanwhile, told The Associated Press the boys stepfather had been arrested, that he had confessed to sticking the needles into the boy with the help of a woman and that authorities were investigating whether black magic was involved. Surgeons at a hospital in the town of Barreiras in Bahia state decided not to try to remove any needles after discovering that two were very near the boys heart, said an official at Hospital do Oeste. Like the police official, she spoke on condition of anonymity.        
	She said that doctors had located 42 needles in the boy  eight fewer than they had reported finding yesterday. The boy was in intensive care but was in stable condition before being airlifted 390km to a hospital in the coastal city of Salvador with a special heart unit. Dr Luiz Cesar Soltoski at the Hospital Oeste, who was treating the boy, said yesterday that surgeons had hoped to remove most of the needles. The boys mother, a maid, took him to a hospital in the small northeastern city of Ibotirama last Thursday, saying he was complaining of pain.

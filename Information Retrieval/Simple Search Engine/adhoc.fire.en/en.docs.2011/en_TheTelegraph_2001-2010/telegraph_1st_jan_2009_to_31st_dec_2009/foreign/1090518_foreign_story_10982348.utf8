The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Victory for women in Kuwait polls
                                                                                                               Victory for women in Kuwait polls
                                  
	Kuwait, May 17 (Reuters): Women won four seats in Kuwaits parliament, a first for the Gulf Arab state, in an election that also saw liberals and Shia lawmakers claw five seats away from Sunni Islamists who have long dominated the 50-seat Assembly.        
	Kuwaits first women lawmakers include Massouma al-Mubarak, who became the countrys first female minister in 2005, the year women were first given the right to vote and run for office. The others are US-educated professors Salwa al-Jassar and Aseel Awadhi and leading economist Rola Dashti.        
	No women won seats in the 2006 and 2008 elections in the conservative Muslim country where politics is still widely seen as a mans domain.        
	The Salafist Movement, a Sunni Islamist bloc, had called on voters to boycott female candidates.        
	Sixteen women were among the 210 candidates. Some 384,790 Kuwaitis, over half of them women, were eligible to vote.

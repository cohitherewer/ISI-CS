The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Pervez: ISI still has militant links
                                                                                                               Pervez: ISI still has militant links
  - India interfering in Swat: Ex-President                            Musharraf: Enemies against enemies                                  
	London, June 8 (PTI): Former Pakistan President Pervez Musharraf has admitted that the ISI still maintains links with militant commanders like Sirajuddin Haqqani, suspected of having masterminded the attack on the Indian embassy in Kabul.        
	He said the ISI had used Haqqanis influence to free the Pakistan ambassador in Kabul who was kidnapped by Tehrik-e-Taliban chief Baitullah Mehsud.        
	Haqqani is the man who has influence over Baitullah Mehsud, a dangerous terrorist, the fiercest commander in South Waziristan and the murderer of Benazir Bhutto, as we know today, Musharraf said in an interview to German magazine Der Spiegel.        
	Mehsud kidnapped our ambassador in Kabul and our intelligence used Haqqanis influence to get him released. Now that does not mean that Haqqani is supported by us. The intelligence service is using certain enemies against other enemies. And it is better to tackle them one by one than making them all enemies, he said.        
	During the interview, Musharraf accused the Indian intelligence agency, RAW, of interfering in the Swat Valley and arming and financing rebels in Baluchistan.         
	He claimed that if the world was serious about combating terrorism then dont leave India out, since there is an Indian element behind the current situation in his country. Claiming that President Barack Obama does not understand the reality in Pakistan, Musharraf said that India should not be left out of the mandate of Richard Holbrooke, the US special envoy for Pakistan and Afghanistan.        
	Musharraf said he did not support the Afghanistan-Pakistan policy for two reasons: First, the strategy puts Pakistan on the same level as Afghanistan.        
	We are not. Afghanistan has no government and the country is completely destabilised. Pakistan is not.        
	Second, and this is much more important, is that there is an Indian element in the whole game. We have the Kashmir struggle, without which extremist elements like Lashkar-e-Toiba would not exist, he said.        
	Musharraf saw a conspiracy going on to weaken the Pakistan Army and ISI, saying that the talk of Balkanisation of his country was wrong as long as the army and the intelligence were intact and strong. He refused to name who was behind this conspiracy, merely pointing at India.         
	On US media reports that the ISI had systematically supported the Taliban, the former Pakistan President said: Intelligence always has access to other network  that is what Americans did with the KGB, that is what the ISI also does.        
	Haqqani is the son of mujahideen commander Jalaluddin Haqqani who is now one of the foremost commanders of the Afghan Taliban. Haqqani is also responsible for carrying out the attack on the Indian embassy in Kabul on July 7, 2008.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Pirates seize US ship, crew
                                                                                                               Pirates seize US ship, crew
                            
	Nairobi, April 8 (Reuters): Somali pirates hijacked a US-flagged, Danish-owned container ship today with 20 American sailors on board, but a Pentagon official said the crew appeared to have retaken control of the vessel.        
	Maersk Line Ltd, the US subsidiary of Denmarks A.P. Moller-Maersk that owns the ship, said it could not confirm the vessel was back under the control of its crew.        
	Maritime officials said the 17,000-tonne Maersk Alabama was seized off Mogadishu far out in the Indian Ocean in an escalation in attacks off the lawless Horn of Africa nation.        
	It is our understanding that the crew is back in control, the Pentagon official, who asked not to be named, told Reuters.        
	A.P. Moller-Maersk confirmed the Maersk Alabama had been attacked by pirates about 500km off Somalia and was presumed hijacked. It said it had 20 American crew on board.        
	It would be the first time Somali pirates have captured US citizens, and the White House said it was closely monitoring the situation before deciding what to do.        
	Maersk Line president John Reinhart told reporters he could not confirm that the crew had retaken control.         
	A lot of speculation is going on. I believe it is premature to comment on that, he said on a conference call. Reinhart said he received a cell phone call from the crew at about 1500GMT saying they were all safe. Among the ships cargo were 400 containers of food aid.

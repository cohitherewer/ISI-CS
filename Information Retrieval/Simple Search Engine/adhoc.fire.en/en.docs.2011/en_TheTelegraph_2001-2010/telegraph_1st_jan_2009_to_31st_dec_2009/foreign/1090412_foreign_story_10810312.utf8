The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Gourmet dinner for delegates must go on
                                                                                                               Gourmet dinner for delegates must go on
                            
	Pattaya (Thailand), April 11 (AP): The dinner must go on.        
	Just because the Asia summit was cancelled today after anti-government protesters stormed the conference venue didnt mean a gourmet feast planned for delegates had to go to waste.        
	In a surreal scene, female servers in traditional Thai dress offered a four-course meal to dozens of soldiers in uniform  some of whom had watched as the protesters gleefully entered the venue.        
	They were joined in the 700-seat ballroom by reporters, ministry of foreign affairs staffers and technical workers who helped set up the summit.        
	There was no sign of the red-shirted protesters who had run amok several hours earlier, demanding Thai Prime Minister Abhisit Vejjajivas resignation.        
	As soft piano music drifted through the hall, the casually dressed diners sipped red and white wine and enjoyed a meal that included shrimp sate, lobster, chicken with cashews and a desert of candied water chestnuts in coconut milk.        
	The hotel charged us. We have to pay anyway, said Suhat Sungchaya, who was tasked with helping organise the dinner for the ministry. So that is why we decided to invite the people behind the scenes.        
	Munching on a catfish salad, ministry intern Suthanthip Sararith said the delegates from 16 countries missed out on a chance to enjoy some traditional Thai delicacies. Most of the delegates were evacuated by helicopter or naval ship hours before the dinner began. Im sorry for the leaders. Thailand is famous for its food, she said. They cant eat all this great food. We get the chance to see how it tastes.

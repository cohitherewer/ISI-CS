	London, Sept. 2: Cate Blanchett, the Oscar-winning actress, suffered a head injury when she was hit by a prop during a live performance of A Streetcar Named Desire in Sydney.        
	 Blanchett was acting in a fight scene with her co-star, Joel Edgerton, when he accidentally struck her with a radio. She continued with the performance for around a minute, before leaving the stage with blood pouring down her head. The production at the Sydney Theatre Company today was halted and the show was cancelled.        
	One witness described the moment when Edgerton hit Blanchett. He was supposed to throw [the radio] out the window, but it sort of slipped and hit her in the head.

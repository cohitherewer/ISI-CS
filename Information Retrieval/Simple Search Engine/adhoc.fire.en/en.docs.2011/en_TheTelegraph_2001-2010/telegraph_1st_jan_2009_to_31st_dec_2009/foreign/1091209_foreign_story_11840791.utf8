	Mirren strip    
	 London, Dec. 8 (PTI): Actress Helen Mirren believes that it has become easier for her to strip on screen as she gets older.      
	The 64-year-old star, who has shed her clothes on screen in several movies, says baring all in front of the camera has become liberating because she no longer thinks of the response from her male fans, reports www.Contactmusic.com.      
	As you get older naked stuff gets easier. Its more to do with the role than what men in the audience think. Theres a liberation about it, Mirren said. The Queen actress also believes that she has learned something from every man she has dated.       
	Ken Cranham, like all the men I have had a proper relationship with, left me a better person than he found me, the actress said in an interview with Broadcast Now.       
	 Mirren married her husband, American director Taylor Hackford, in 1997, 11 years after they started dating, and credits his honesty with keeping them together. Taylor can be turbulent, irrational and explosive. He has made me cry on many occasions... He is also the most unsexist man, looking women directly in the eye with no curtain of assumptions or prejudices to cloud his view. He is brave, loyal and supportive.

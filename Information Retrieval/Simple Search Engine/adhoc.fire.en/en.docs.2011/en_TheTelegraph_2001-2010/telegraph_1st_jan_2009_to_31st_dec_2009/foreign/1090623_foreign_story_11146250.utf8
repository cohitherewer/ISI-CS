	Rochester (New York), June 22 (AP): Sorry, Paul Simon, Kodak is taking your Kodachrome away.        
	The Eastman Kodak Co. announced today its retiring its most senior film because of declining customer demand in an increasingly digital age.        
	The worlds first commercially successful colour film,immortalised in song by Simon, spent 74 years in Kodaks portfolio. It enjoyed its heyday in the 1950s and Sixties but in recent years has nudged closer to obscurity: Sales of Kodachrome are now just a fraction of 1 per cent of the companys total sales of still-picture films, and only one commercial lab in the world still processes it.         
	 Those numbers and the unique materials needed to make it convinced Kodak to call its most recent manufacturing run the last, said Mary Jane Hellyar, the outgoing president of Kodaks Film, Photofinishing and Entertainment Group. Kodachrome is particularly difficult (to retire) because it really has become kind of an icon, Hellyar said.        
	Simon crooned about it in 1973 in the aptly titled Kodachrome. They give us those nice bright colours. They give us the greens of summers. Makes you think all the worlds a sunny day, he sang. So Mama dont take my Kodachrome away.        
	Indeed, Kodachrome was favoured by still and motion picture photographers for its rich but realistic tones, vibrant colours and durability.        
	It was the basis not only for countless family slideshows on carousel projectors over the years but also for world-renowned images, including Abraham Zapruders 8 mm reel of President John F. Kennedys assassination on November 22, 1963.        
	Hellyar estimates the retail supply of Kodachrome will run out in autumn, though it could be sooner if devotees stockpile. In the US, Kodachrome film is available only through photo specialty dealers. In Europe, some retailers, including the Boots chain, carry it.        
	Photojournalist Steve McCurrys widely recognised portrait of an Afghan refugee girl, shot on Kodachrome, appeared on the cover of National Geographic in 1985. At Kodaks request, McCurry will shoot one of the last rolls of Kodachrome film and donate the images to the George Eastman House museum.

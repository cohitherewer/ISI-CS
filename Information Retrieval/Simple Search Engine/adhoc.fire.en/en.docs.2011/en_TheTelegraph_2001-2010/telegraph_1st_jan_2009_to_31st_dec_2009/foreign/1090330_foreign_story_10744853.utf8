	Eye for games    
	 Chicago, March 29 (Reuters): Adults who play a lot of action video games may be improving their eyesight, US researchers said today.      
	They said people who used a video-game training programme saw significant improvements in their ability to notice subtle differences in shades of gray, a finding that may help people who have trouble with night driving.      
	Daphne Bavelier of the University of Rochester in New York said: Weve found that action video games train the brain to process the existing visual information more efficiently, and the improvements last for months after game play stopped.      
	When people play action games, theyre changing the brains pathway responsible for visual processing. These games push the human visual system to the limits and the brain adapts to it.    
	Wall prank    
	 London: A group of pranksters blocked up a friends front door with a brick wall as payback for a previous practical joke.       
	Leigh Black began plotting his revenge after his friend Dave Pearce sneaked into his house while he was away and rearranged all of his furniture.       
	 Pearce went away on holiday to Thailand, Black teamed up with three friends to build a brick wall across his front door.       
	Despite being heavily jet-lagged after his flight home, Pearce managed to knock the wall down.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | ISI boss in US meet
                                                                                                               ISI boss in US meet
          NASIR JAFFRY                               
	Islamabad, May 3: Pakistan army chief General Ashfaq Kayani will send the ISI boss and the military intelligence chief as his representatives to attend high-level meetings in the US this week aimed at finding ways to curb militancy and extremisim.         
	ISI chief Lieutenant General Shuja Pasha and intelligence chief Muhammad Asif are expected to leave for Washington tomorrow         
	President Asif Ali Zardari is also scheduled to leave for Washington on May 5 on a four-day visit for bilateral talks with his American counterpart Barack Obama. He will also attend a trilateral summit with the US and Afghan Presidents.         
	Zardaris visit to the US takes place against the backdrop of concerns repeatedly expressed by top American officials on a deal between the Pakistani government and pro-Taliban cleric Soofi Mohammad in February for enforcement of Sharia in Malakand division in the northwest.         
	The Pakistani military launched a ground and air offensive against Taliban militants in Buner and Lower Dir, both in Malakand, last week.         
	The military said in a statement today the operation in Buner district was still in progress and so far 80 militants have been killed.         
	Officials said the current situation in the northwestern region was one of the main reasons why General Kayani has decided to send the ISI and military intelligence chiefs to the US, which has been terming the Talibans advances in the northwest as an existential threat to Pakistan.         
	Kayani has over the last two years developed a close understanding with the US Joint Chiefs of Staff Admiral Michael Mullen, who has been frequently exchanging notes with him on the fight against militancy and extremism in Afghanistan and Pakistan.         
	Foreign ministry spokesperson Abdul Basit said in Islamabad today Zardari will also meet US Vice-President Joseph Biden, secretary of state Hillary Clinton, the US envoy to Afghanistan and Pakistan Richard Holbrooke, and senior members of the Congress.         
	The visit will provide an opportunity to have more focussed interaction on regional cooperation at the highest level, Basit added.

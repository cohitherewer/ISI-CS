The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Pak court lifts Sharif ban
                                                                                                               Pak court lifts Sharif ban
  - Judgment allows ex-PM, brother to contest elections        NASIR JAFFRY AND AGENCIES                          Sharif: Pleased                                        
	Islamabad, May 26: The Pakistan Supreme Court today ruled that former Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif and his brother can contest elections, reversing a decision that had let to widespread protests.        
	The courts five-member bench also allowed Nawazs younger brother and Punjab chief minister Shahbaz Sharif to continue to hold public office.         
	In February, the court had banned the two brothers from holding public office or contesting elections. The judgment forced Shahbaz to give up the chief ministers post. However, in March, the court gave Shahbaz an interim relief, asking him to continue as chief minister, pending a final decision on his appeal.         
	The order that earlier disqualified Nawaz Sharif and Shahbaz Sharif has been set aside, their lawyer Ashtar Ausaf told reporters outside the court. It is a day of thanks giving for all of us, Sharif said in his farm house near Lahore. He said the ruling showed the country was heading in the right direction.        
	This is a decision welcomed by the entire nation, Sharif.Today an independent judiciary is giving independent decisions.        
	The question of the Sharifs eligibility for elections has contributed to political uncertainty when the US and other western allies want to see the government fully focus on the battle against militancy.        
	Sharifs Pakistan Muslim League (Nawaz) is the main Opposition party but he has been generally supportive of the government led by President Asif Ali Zardaris party on main issues such as an offensive against militants in the Swat region.         
	The affirmation of Sharifs eligibility for election was not expected to intensify confrontation between the two main parties in the short-term though they are likely to compete fiercely in the run-up to the next general election, due by 2013.        
	Zardari welcomed the court ruling, saying in a statement he hoped Sharifs party would play a greater role in strengthening democracy.        
	Sharif said his party, which came second in a February 2008 general election, would decide if and when he would contest a by-election.        
	Both brothers were unable to contest the 2008 election, although Shahbaz did later win a by-election for a provincial Assembly seat in Punjab.

	Row over Julia film    
	 London, Oct. 17 (PTI): Actress Julia Roberts may have had a pleasant experience shooting in India, but her film has run into trouble in Indonesia.      
	Her new film Eat, Pray, Love was thrown into turmoil after locals in the village of Bentuyung, where filming was scheduled to take place, objected when the crew arrived a month early. They blocked roads and demanded a payment of $32,000 for the use of the location.       
	District chief Tjokorda Oka Artha Ardana Sukawati said the problem was since been resolved.

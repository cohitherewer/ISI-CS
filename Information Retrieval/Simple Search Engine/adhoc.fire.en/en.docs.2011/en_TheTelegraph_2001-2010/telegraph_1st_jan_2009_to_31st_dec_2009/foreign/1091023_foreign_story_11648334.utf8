          NASIR JAFFRY                               
	Islamabad, Oct 22: Unknown attackers ambushed a Pakistan army jeep in a posh locality in Islamabad, killing a serving Brigadier and his driver, in a second apparent militants assault in less than 48 hours.         
	Brigadier Moinuddin Ahmad was on leave from UN peacekeeping mission in Darfur, Sudan. While there was no official word from the army, a top police official in Islamabad said that the attackers, who were two in number and riding a motorbike sprayed bullet on Ahmads car and ranaway.         
	 quot;Brigadier Ahmad sucummbed to his injuries in the hospital while his driver was killed on the spot, quot; Islamabad police chief Kalim Imam told reporters.         
	He said that the incident took place in Islamabads posh G-11 sector, where Brigadier Ahmad has his residence.         
	 quot;It seems to be a target killing, quot; Imam said, adding that the attackers were following Brigadier Ahmads movements. quot; He said one of the attackers fired bullets from the front while the other attacked from the back side.         
	no one has so far claimed responsibility of the attack, which coincided with police raids in the area as a follow up of Tuesdas twin suicide attacks in Islamabads International Islamic University, which left seven people including the two bombers dead.         
	Almost all the previous attacks mostly targeting security forces in Punjab, Islamabad and North West Frontier Province (NWFP) were claimed by Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), which is currently facing a punishing military operation in its stronghold of South Waziristan tribal region bordering Afghanistan.         
	The new attack came almost two weeks after TTP militants stormed the armys General Headquarters in the garrison town of Rawalpindi on October 10. The army commandos had repulsed the attack after a day-long seige of the security office of the headquarters, which killed nine army personnel and an equal number of militants.         
	Pakistan has been on a high alert since last one month as more than 180 people have been killed during this period in a series of suicide and gun attacks in Lahore, Islamabad, Peshawar and other cities of NWFP. Pakistans government also shut all schools, colleges and universities all over the country following the attas on Islamabad university virtually keeping millions of students at home.

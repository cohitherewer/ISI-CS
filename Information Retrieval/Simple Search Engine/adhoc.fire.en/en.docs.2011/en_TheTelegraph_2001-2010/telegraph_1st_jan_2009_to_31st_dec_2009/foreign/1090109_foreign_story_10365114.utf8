The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | 6-yr-old drives car to school

	Washington, Jan. 8: The word miracle can be overused. But when a 6-year-old boy drives a Ford Taurus for more than 16km, weaving in and out of oncoming traffic, slams into a utility pole and no one gets hurt, well, maybe miracle is appropriate.        
	Thats what happened on Virginias Northern Neck on Monday morning, when the first-grade student missed his school bus and decided to drive his moms car to elementary school so he wouldnt miss breakfast and physical education, authorities said yesterday. Its a miracle that somebody didnt get killed, said Northumberland county sheriff Chuck Wilkins of the boys drive along Northumberland Highway. Were a rural area, but if we do have a rush hour, thats it.        
	The boys parents were arrested and charged with felony child endangerment. Wilkins said the father, David E. Dodson, 40, was under a court order not to leave the 6-year-old and his 4-year-old brother alone with their mother, Jacqulyn D. Waltman, 26, at their home in the town of Wicomico Church. But Dodson left for work at 6:30am, and Waltman was still asleep when the 6-year-old missed the bus and then drove off at 7:40am for Northumberland Elementary School, Wilkins said.        
	Sgt Thomas A. Cunningham Jr. of the Virginia State Police said the boy is not particularly tall for his age and was possibly standing while driving the Taurus. Wilkins said the child had an idea about how to start, propel and steer the car from playing video games. Once he got going, the boy navigated his way along Route 200 (Dupont Highway), across a bridge spanning the Great Wicomico River and then turned west on Northumberland Highway, which is about 225km from Washington. He made it through two intersections, Wilkins said, and then was doing a pretty great rate of speed as he passed cars on the two-lane road while not wearing a seat belt.

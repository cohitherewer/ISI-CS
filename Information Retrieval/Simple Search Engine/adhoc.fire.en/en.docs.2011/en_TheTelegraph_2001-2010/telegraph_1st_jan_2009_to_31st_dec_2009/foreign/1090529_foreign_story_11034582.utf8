The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Pak hand in Tiger defeat
                                                                                                               Pak hand in Tiger defeat
  - Army played key role                                
	London, May 28 (PTI): Pakistani forces played a key role in the defeat of the Tamil Tigers, media reports in Pakistan have claimed.        
	Other than supplying its main battle tank, the Al Khalid, Pakistan fighter pilots flew air strike missions on LTTE bases and sent some of their best-trained army officers to Colombo to help in the war against the Tigers.        
	It was the Pakistani defence cooperation with Sri Lanka as the largest suppliers of high-tech military equipment that played a major role in the ultimate defeat of the LTTE at the hands of the Sri Lankan army, The News daily quoted Pakistani government sources as saying.        
	The newspaper said the defence cooperation between Sri Lanka and Pakistan had grown significantly in recent years. Islamabad, unlike New Delhi, had no problems supplying state-of-the-art weapons to the Lankan army in its operations against the LTTE.        
	The report said the Lankan army was running short of ammunition but tied up supplies of 60mm, 81mm, 120mm and 130mm mortars and 150,000 grenades every ten days during its crucial battle in the Tigers political capital of Kilinochchi.         
	According to the report, Pakistan supplied weapons and ammunition worth $190 million for the past one year.         
	Pakistans involvement was contrary to the LTTE propaganda that India was helping the Lankan government.         
	In May 2008, Sri Lankan army chief Sarath Fonseka visited Islamabad and held detailed talks with his Pakistani counterpart chief of army staff General Ashfaq Parvez Kayani to finalise the arms purchase. This meeting was followed by talks between Pakistani defence secretary Lieutenant General Syed Athar Ali and his Lankan counterpart Gotabhaya Rajapakse in Rawalpindi on January 19, 2009.

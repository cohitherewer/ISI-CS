	Kate: Old amp; happy    
	London, June 8 (PTI): Oscar-winning actress Kate Winslet believes that turning 33 has helped her feel comfortable in her skin.       
	The Titanic star, who is famous for her natural beauty and acting talent, said that she is happy with her body despite having given birth to two children, reports Hello magazine.      
	I dont feel self-conscious any more. I think turning 30, youre allowed to be less obsessed with how you look. I really like being 33. I dont think I look younger than I am or older than I am. I think I look my age, Winslet said.       
	The Reader star boasts a figure most would envy.

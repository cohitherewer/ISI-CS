	London, Nov. 19 (PTI): Popstar Mariah Carey is known for her diva demands but she outdid herself by asking to be surrounded by 20 white kittens and 100 white doves for a brief appearance at a mall.         
	Careys hosts were relieved when her demands were turned down by UKs health and safety officials, reports the Daily Mail.        
	Carey also wanted confetti shaped like butterflies to shower over her at the end of her appearance at the Westfield complex in west London. It included being driven in a Rolls Royce along a pink carpet to the pink podium where she was supposed to turn on the lights.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | US forces kill Qaida leader
                                                                                                               US forces kill Qaida leader
                              Nabhan                            
	Mogadishu, Sept. 15 (Reuters): US special forces in helicopters attacked a car in southern Somalia today and killed one of east Africas most wanted al Qaida militants, witnesses and US sources said.        
	Kenyan-born Saleh Ali Saleh Nabhan, 28, was suspected of building the truck bomb that killed 15 people at a Kenyan hotel in 2002, as well as involvement in a simultaneous, but botched, missile launch at an Israeli airliner leaving Mombasa airport.        
	A senior Somali government source said the fugitive was in a car with other foreign insurgents from the al Shabaab rebel group when they were hit near Roobow village in Barawe district, some 250 km south of the capital.

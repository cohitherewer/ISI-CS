The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Defiant Hasina knows bullets are chasing her
                                                                                                               Defiant Hasina knows bullets are chasing her
          SOMINI SENGUPTA                          Hasina: No one can stop me                                  
	Dhaka, March 14: Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina has called last months border guard mutiny a big conspiracy against her agenda to establish a secular democracy in her country.        
	In her first extensive interview since the February 25 siege, Hasina struck a note of defiant resolve. No one will stop me, she said. I will continue. Then she raised her eyebrows and offered a hint of a smile. We have to unearth all these conspiracies.        
	Hasina, 61, has the air of a strict grandmother. She speaks softly. She wears traditional Bengali saris that cover her head. Her eyes are a cool grey.         
	She said she was keen to hunt down and punish those responsible for the mutiny. She suggested that several factions unhappy with her agenda could have been responsible, including Islamist militants, whom she has vowed to crush.         
	There are many elements, she said. These terrorist groups are very much active. This incident gives us a lesson. It can happen again.        
	After two years of army-backed rule in the country, Hasina won a resounding majority of the parliamentary seats in elections last December, after campaigning on a slate of provocative promises.         
	She said she would root out Islamist guerillas, put on trial those suspected of conspiring against Bangladeshs independence from Pakistan in 1971, nurture friendly relations with India and stop anti-Indian insurgents from using Bangladeshi soil to launch attacks against New Delhi.        
	Altogether, 74 people were killed in the mutiny, mostly army officers in command of the border force. Two separate investigations are under way: one by the army, another by Hasinas government.         
	Whether either will yield credible results or whether their findings will be consistent is unknown. Hasinas fate and the stability of the country depend on a satisfactory resolution.        
	No sooner did the siege end than the arguments began. Today, the bitter points of contention are whether the army commanders were killed before or after negotiations began (the time of death has not yet been established for all the victims), whether Hasina pressed to know the scale of the killings before offering amnesty, and, most important, why she did not permit the army to storm the compound early on.        
	Hasina said sending in the army would have resulted in a bloodbath and risked a potential conflict between the 46 border guard battalions scattered across the country and their army commanders.        
	In any case, few in Bangladesh say they believe that the mutiny was what it first appeared: a rebellion of rank-and-file border guards aggrieved by their commanders, their pay and their working conditions. In a country where conspiracy theories are a national sport, the mutiny has become a screen onto which many anxieties are projected.        
	Some point to terrorist groups and anti-Indian insurgents. Others say that it was fuelled by intelligence agencies in either India or Pakistan  both countries have been alternately friend and foe to Bangladesh. There are those who suggest that it could involve politicians who lost the last election, while others blame people within Hasinas party whose goal is to keep the army in check.        
	The truth of what happened may never be known.         
	Central to Hasinas survival today is keeping the military on her side. Her face-off with the army came into sharp focus three days after the mutiny ended when she confronted an unusually rowdy room of army officers. They berated her for not allowing the army to take charge early on.         
	In the interview, Hasina said she sympathised with the soldiers grief even as she cautioned them against taking revenge  or power. So far, the army does not seem interested.         
	Instead, Hasinas most dangerous enemies have been the Islamist militant groups that have put down roots here in recent years. They have been implicated in assassination attempts against her, including a grenade attack on her political meeting in August 2004. Hasina lost some of her hearing as a result of that attack.        
	Sitting under a framed portrait of her father, she said she would not be bowed. If I am afraid for my life, the whole nation will be afraid, she said. I know some bullets, some grenades are chasing me.

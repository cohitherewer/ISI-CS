The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Palestinians have right to homeland, says Pope

	Bethlehem (West Bank), May 13: Pope Benedict XVI travelled today to this town that Christians revere as the birthplace of Jesus, telling Palestinians that after decades of suffering, they had a right to a sovereign homeland in the land of your forefathers, secure and at peace with its neighbours, within internationally recognised borders.        
	Confronting the regions political tripwires, he evoked the loss, the hardship and the suffering of Palestinians in war-torn Gaza, saying he prayed for the lifting of the economic embargo that Israel has imposed there since the militant group Hamas took control in 2007.         
	Speaking in the presence of President Mahmoud Abbas before offering a mass in a sunlit Manger Square, he also urged young Palestinians to have the courage to resist any temptation you may feel to resort to acts of violence or terrorism.        
	While his words on Palestinian statehood reflected Vatican policy, and followed a similar endorsement two days ago, they gained added weight from his presence here  the first time he has ventured into the West Bank since he arrived in Israel on Monday from Jordan on his first West Asia journey as pope. As with the rest of his tour, the visit carried a heavy political charge.

	Handbag loo    
	Berlin, Sept. 3: A German company is marketing a mobile toilet for women that fits into their handbags and can be used whenever they are caught short, reports The Daily Telegraph.      
	Aware that the fairer sex battle with long queues at conveniences and are loathe to relieve themselves at roadsides like men, the makers of the Ladybag believe they are on to a winner. The disposable portable lavatory consists of a plastic bag fitted with absorbent polymers that turn urine into a gel.

	Beijing, Dec. 29 (PTI): Nepal today promised China that it will not allow its territory to be used for protests against Beijing.        
	The assurance comes as Chinese Prime Minister Wen Jiabao and visiting Nepali Premier Madhav Kumar Nepal agreed to upgrade their bilateral ties by forging a comprehensive and cooperative partnership.         
	The partnership signals closer ties between China and Nepal, who have always enjoyed close ties, the official Xinhua news agency said. It added that the meeting between Wen and Nepal lasted an hour and was held at the Great Hall of the People here.        
	Wen hailed the sound development of bilateral ties since China and Nepal forged diplomatic ties 54 years ago. He said the two countries have become good neighbours. Nepal, on his maiden visit to China, assured Wen that his country would adhere to the one-China policy.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Fat cats shrug: we eat what we kill
                                                                                                               Fat cats shrug: we eat what we kill
          ALAN FEUER AND KAREN ZRAICK                           A man offers leaflets for a shop buying gold on Wall St. (AFP)                                  
	New York, Jan. 31: Getting between a broker and his bonus is like getting between a schnauzer and his lunch bowl. He may not bite you, but you are going to smell his breath.         
	People come here because they want to work hard and get paid a lot for working hard, one investment banker said yesterday as he wended his way, lunch bag in hand, through the World Financial Center. I think theres a disconnect between Wall Street and Main Street.         
	That certainly was the case this week when Main Street learned that, despite the craters of a down economy, Wall Street bonuses were more than $18 billion last year  roughly what they were in the fatty, solvent days of 2004. The media hollered, President Barack Obama scolded, and ordinary people checked their wallets. But downtown, in the caverns of finance, the moneymakers shrugged and took it on the chin.         
	It is a complicated thing, they said, to apportion compensation in a bear market. First of all, profits do not stop; they often ebb. Second of all, losses move unequally, so the law of the jungle should still apply: you eat what you can kill.         
	My bonus is shameful  but I worked hard to get it, said John Konstantinidis, a wholesale insurance broker, a day after Obama termed the bonuses shameful.         
	 Im a HENRY, Konstantinidis added. High Earner but Not Rich Yet.         
	Nonetheless, it was rather remarkable yesterday how many white shirts denied getting a bonus altogether when they were asked. Indeed, if the data obtained by reporters in the district was any measure, there was no telling where that $18 billion really went.         
	What can be told, however, is that Obama is substantially less popular on Wall Street this week than he was last week. Words like outrageous, shameful and the height of irresponsibility  especially when applied to a mans pay cheque  tend not to make you many friends.         
	I think President Obama painted everyone with a broad stroke, said Brian McCaffrey, 55, a Wall Street lawyer. The only way that well get any of our bailout money back is from taxes on bonuses. I think bonuses should be looked at on a case by case basis, or you turn into a socialist.         
	That, indeed, was a recurring equation: Broad strokes + bonuses = socialist.         
	There were, of course, those downtown who were disgusted by the thought of this years bonuses, though they were mainly wage earners like Ashton Johnson, 32, a courier who was chatting outside the stock exchange with a buddy wearing a sandwich board reading, We buy gold.         
	It definitely is shameful, Johnson said. With stock going down, they shouldnt be paid so much.         
	Around the corner, Larry Meyers and Gerard Novello, who work for an Italian securities firm, ducked into a Mexican cantina for a drink.         
	 On Main Street, bonus sounds like a gift, Meyers said. But its part of the compensation structure of Wall Street. Say Im a banker and I created $30 million. I should get a part of that. Theres got to be a better term for it, he added, turning to Novello.         
	Earned income credit? he wondered aloud.                    NEW YORK TIMES NEWS SERVICE

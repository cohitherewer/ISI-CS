	Washington, Oct. 8 (PTI): The world Muslim population stands at 1.57 billion, meaning that nearly one in four persons practises Islam, according to a study.        
	It also said that India has the third-largest Muslim population  160.94 million  behind only Indonesia and Pakistan.         
	The study by the Pew Forum on Religion and Public Life, which covered more than 200 countries, found that Muslims represent 23 per cent of an estimated 2009 world population of 6.8 billion. While Muslims are found on all five continents, more than 60 per cent of the global Muslim population is in Asia and about 20 per cent is in West Asia and North Africa, the study said.

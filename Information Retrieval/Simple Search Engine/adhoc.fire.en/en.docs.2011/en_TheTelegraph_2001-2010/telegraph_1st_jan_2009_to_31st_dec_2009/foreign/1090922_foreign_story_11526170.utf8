	London, Sept. 21 (AP): Something is rotten in the city of Stratford-upon-Avon.        
	Its the beam that supports the roof over the grave of William Shakespeare, and the church were he lies is urgently seeking 50,000 for repairs.        
	The Reverend Martin Gorick, vicar of Holy Trinity Church in Stratford-upon-Avon, said the problem was discovered three weeks ago by workmen on the roof of the church, who were alarmed to find bits of the beam falling off. It supports the roof of the chancel, the part of the church where the altar stands and where Shakespeare is buried.         
	The church has raised 1 million in the past seven years for restoration work.

	 London, Jan. 29: A video of a baby crawling across a room to see her pet dog has had nearly half a million hits, reports The Daily Telegraph.       
	Lucy is filmed by her mother as she plays with the family dog Nike. The American baby crawls up to Nike and lets it lick her face, laughing throughout the one minute clip. But while the video received five stars from viewers, some YouTube users were concerned that the dog might be about to lash out at Lucy. Alexandra Semyonova wrote: The dog exercises huge self control for a full minute and a half, then gets up and walks away in the end.       
	But if it hadnt, if it had lashed out even symbolically, this child could have spent the rest of its life without a face  and everyone would have blamed the dog.

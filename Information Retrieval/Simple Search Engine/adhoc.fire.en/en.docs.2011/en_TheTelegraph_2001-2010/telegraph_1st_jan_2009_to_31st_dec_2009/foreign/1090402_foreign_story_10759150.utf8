  Drone kills 12 the day after leader threat                                  
	Islamabad, April 1 (Agencies): A suspected US drone fired two missiles today at an alleged hide-out connected to Taliban leader Baitullah Mehsud who has threatened to attack Washington, killing 12 people and wounding several others, officials said.        
	The attack came a day after Mehsud, the head of the Taliban in Pakistan, claimed responsibility for a deadly attack on a police academy in Lahore this week, saying it was retaliation for US missile strikes on militant strongholds along the Afghan border.         
	Mehsud also vowed to launch an attack on Washington or even the White House in phone interviews with The Associated Press and local media.        
	The FBI, however, said there was no indication of anything imminent.        
	A local intelligence official told The Associated Press the compound attacked today in a remote area of the Orakzai tribal region near the Afghan border belonged to one of Mehsuds commanders.        
	Up to 30 suspected militants were at the compound when it was hit, and the Taliban have moved the dead and injured to an undisclosed location, he said.        
	The strike is believed to be the first in Orakzai, another sign the US is expanding its attack zone, possibly because of pressure on militants to keep moving.        
	Mehsuds deputy Hakimullah Mehsud is in charge of Taliban operations in Orakzai. Late today, he called an AP reporter who has spoken to him before and is familiar with his voice, to threaten a revenge attack on Pakistans capital.        
	Very soon we will strike in Islamabad in a way that everyone there will feel pain, he said, adding that Pakistans ruling lawmakers will be targets. We will strike at the leadership, processions and public meetings of the ruling parties because they are also pro-US.        
	Two other senior intelligence officials said they believe 12 people were killed in the strike, including close associates of Mehsud. But it was difficult to confirm the exact identities of those involved because the Taliban surrounded the area shortly after the attack, they said.        
	Pakistan has publicly protested the attacks, calling them a violation of its sovereignty that also deepens anti-American sentiment.         
	Lahore arrests         
	Pakistani police have made some significant arrests in their investigation into the militant attack this week at a police academy in Lahore, a police investigator and a security official said today.        
	Theres been significant progress, the senior police investigator said.        
	We have captured seven men who had direct links with the attackers. Two of them were handlers, said the investigator who declined to be identified.        
	A security official confirmed that significant arrests had been made. He declined to give details but said the claim by Mehsud could have been a ruse aimed at misleading investigators.

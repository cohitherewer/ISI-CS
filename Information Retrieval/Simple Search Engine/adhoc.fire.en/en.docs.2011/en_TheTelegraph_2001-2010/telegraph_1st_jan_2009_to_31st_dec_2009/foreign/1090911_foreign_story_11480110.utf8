	Fastest cheetah    
	Cincinnati, Sept. 10: A cheetah called Sarah has broken the record speed for a land animal, reports The Daily Telegraph.      
	The eight-year-old big cat covered 100 metres in 6.13 seconds, over 3 seconds faster than the fastest human time  9.58 seconds, set by sprinter Usain Bolt in August this year.      
	The cheetah ran on a specially designed course at Cincinnati Zoos Regional Cheetah Breeding Facility.       
	Chasing a lure as in greyhound racing, it was able to break the previous record of 6.19 seconds set in 2001 by a male cheetah in South Africa.

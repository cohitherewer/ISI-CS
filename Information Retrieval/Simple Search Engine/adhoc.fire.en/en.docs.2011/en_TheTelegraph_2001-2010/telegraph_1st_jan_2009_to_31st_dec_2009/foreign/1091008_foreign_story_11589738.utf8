The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Pak army irked by US aid bill
                                                                                                               Pak army irked by US aid bill
                                  
	Islamabad, Oct. 7 (Reuters): Pakistans army today expressed serious concern about a US aid bill that critics say contains conditions that amount to a humiliating violation of sovereignty as parliament began a debate on US aid.        
	The US Congress last week approved a bill tripling aid for Pakistan to $1.5 billion a year for the next five years and sent it to President Barack Obama for signing into law.        
	The legislation is part of a bid to build a new relationship with Pakistan that no longer focuses on military ties but on Pakistans social and economic development.        
	But in an effort to address US concerns that Pakistans military may support militant groups, the bill stipulates that US military aid will cease if Pakistan does not help fight terrorists, including Taliban and al Qaida members.         
	The bill, co-authored by Senators John Kerry and Richard Lugar, also provides an assessment of how effective the civilian governments control is over the powerful military.        
	Pakistans army chief met his top commanders at army headquarters in Rawalpindi and reiterated that Pakistan was a sovereign state and had the right to respond to threats in accordance with its interests, the military said.        
	The forum expressed serious concern regarding clauses impacting on national security, the military said.        
	The army, in a rare public comment on a diplomatic issue, did not elaborate but said it was providing the government, which supports the US bill, with formal input.        
	It acknowledged it was parliament that would debate the issue and enable the government to respond.        
	President Asif Ali Zardari earlier rejected suggestions that the bills conditions undermined sovereignty.        
	The controversy comes as the US, Pakistans biggest aid donor, is pressing the army to expand its operations against Pakistani Taliban fighters to include Afghan Taliban and Qaida militants in lawless border enclaves. Plans by the US to expand its embassy in Pakistan have also raised suspicion, as has speculation about the embassys use of private security contractors.

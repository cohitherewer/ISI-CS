	New York, Nov. 21: Physicists returned to their future yesterday.         
	At about 10pm outside Geneva, scientists at Cern, the European Centre for Nuclear Research, succeeded in sending beams of protons clockwise around the 17-mile underground magnetic racetrack known as the Large Hadron Collider, the worlds biggest and most expensive physics experiment.        
	For physicists, the event was a milestone on the way back from disaster and the resumption of a 15-year, $9 billion quest to investigate laws and forces that prevailed when the universe was less than a trillionth of a second old. The collider was designed to accelerate protons to energies of seven trillion electron volts apiece and smash them together in tiny fireballs in an effort to replicate and study the conditions of the Big Bang.        
	The first time protons circled the collider, on September 10, 2008, the event was celebrated with champagne and midnight pajama parties around the world. But the festivities were cut short a few days later when an electrical connection between a pair of the colliders giant superconducting electromagnets vaporised.        
	Subsequent work revealed that the machine was riddled with thousands of connections unable to handle the high currents required to run the collider at its intended energy.        
	Physicists and engineers have spent the past year testing and making repairs. While they have not replaced all the faulty connections, they have patched things up enough to allow the collider to run at less than full speed. Calling the past years work a Herculean effort, Cerns director for accelerators, Steve Myers, said the engineers had learned from painful experience and understood the collider far better than they had before.

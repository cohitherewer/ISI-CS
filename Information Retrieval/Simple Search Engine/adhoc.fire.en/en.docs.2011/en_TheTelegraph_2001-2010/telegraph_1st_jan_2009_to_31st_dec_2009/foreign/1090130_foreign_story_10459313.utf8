The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | CIA chief in Algiers accused   of rape
                                                                                                               CIA chief in Algiers accused   of rape
          ALEX SPILLIUS                                    
	Washington, Jan. 29: The CIA station chief in Algiers is under investigation after claims that he drugged and raped two Algerian women at his official residence, according to a report.         
	Law enforcement sources told ABC News that the 41-year-old officer, named as Muslim convert Andrew Warren, had been sent home in October. He could face charges as early as next month.         
	Investigators from the justice department allegedly found more than a dozen secretly recorded videotapes of Warren performing sex acts with other women. An official said one woman appeared to be in a semi-conscious state.         
	Both the women who came forward to complain and made sworn statements were Muslim, and the case could spark a strong reaction in the Arab world.         
	One of the women said she met Warren at the bar in the American embassy before going to his residence, where she was drugged.         
	Algiers is one of the most sensitive posts in the agency, as it works closely with local intelligence services against a branch of al Qaida that has been responsible for major bombings, including an attack in the capital last August that killed 48 people.         
	The CIA refused to confirm that the investigation was taking place, but a spokesperson said: I can assure you the agency would take seriously, and follow up on, any allegations of impropriety.         
	ABCs sources said the investigation had expanded to Egypt where the officer, who has not been named, served previously. This will be seen as the typical ugly American, said Bob Baer, a former CIA officer.         
	My question is how the CIA would not have picked up on this in their own regular reviews of officers overseas.

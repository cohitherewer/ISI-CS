	Berlin, Nov. 9 (AP): Chancellor Angela Merkel and former Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev crossed a former fortified border today to cheers of Gorby! Gorby! as a throng of grateful Germans recalled the night 20 years ago.        
	Within moments of a confused announcement on November 9, 1989, that East Germany was lifting travel restrictions, hundreds streamed into the enclave that was West Berlin, marking a moment in the collapse of communism in Europe.        
	Merkel, who grew up in East Germany and was one of thousands to cross that night, recalled that before the joy of freedom came, many people suffered.         
	She lauded Gorbachev, with whom she shared an umbrella amid a crush of hundreds, eager for a glimpse of the man many still consider a hero for his role in pushing reform in the Soviet Union. We always knew that something had to happen there so that more could change here, she said.        
	You made this all possible  you courageously let things happen, and that was much more than we could expect, she told Gorbachev in front of several hundred people gathered in light drizzle.        
	Merkel also welcomed Polands 1980s pro-democracy leader, Lech Walesa, to the former crossing today, saying that his Solidarity movement provided incredible encouragement to East Germans.

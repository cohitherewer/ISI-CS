The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Suicide bomber targets Pak police
                                                                                                               Suicide bomber targets Pak police

	Islamabad, March 23 (Agencies): A suicide bomber killed a policeman who had stopped him at the entrance to a police station in Islamabad today, police said.        
	The police Special Branch operated from the station in the Sitara Market neighbourhood of the capital, police said.        
	The Special Branch is responsible for collecting intelligence on terrorism, sectarianism and political activities in the country.        
	The bomber was on foot, and when the guards tried to stop him at the checkpost he blew himself up, said Rana Akbar, a senior official in the city administration.        
	He said one policeman was killed. Five other persons, most of them policeman, were injured.         
	Witnesses said the bomber was accompanied by another person but his whereabouts could not be traced.         
	Interior ministry chief Rehman Malik said: We were on high alert, but there is no way to detect a person who is determined to blow himself up.        
	Malik said intelligence agencies had recently reported that five to six suicide bombers were likely to enter Islamabad to attack political leaders and rallies. Islamabad and other cities were on high alert, he added.         
	Police cordoned off the site, but an eyewitness described the scene.        
	I can see human flesh scattered on the road and the damaged police check post at the gate, Abdul Saboor said.        
	Taliban militants and jihadi groups linked to al Qaida have run a campaign of violence to try to destabilise nuclear-armed Pakistan.        
	 Islamist militants are blamed for near-daily attacks in the Western-allied but increasingly unstable country, though little information on todays bomber was available.        
	A suicide truck bomb attack on the Marriott hotel in Islamabad last September and the assault by gunmen on the Sri Lankan cricket team in Lahore this month were measures of the growing danger.        
	Pakistans President Asif Ali Zardari called on Britain and the US earlier today to do more to help his government fight terrorism.        
	Zardari said his Pakistan Peoples Party had brought democracy to the country after more than eight years under the military rule of General Pervez Musharraf, and the international community should now play its part.        
	Asked in an interview on Sky News television to outline his key message to Britain and the US, Zardari said: The message is: Youve got democracy, democracy is part of the solution  but ... the second part of the solution is with you, so please give us the help that we need.        
	NGOs to leave Swat        
	The Taliban has told all NGOs working in the Swat Valley to pack their bags, saying their activities are un-Islamic.        
	In a recent broadcast on his illegal FM radio station, Taliban commander Maulana Fazlullah said: All NGOs should leave Swat because they are creating problems for peace.        
	Fazlullah has also described all Pakistanis working for NGOs as enemies of the country.        
	They come and tell us how to make latrines in mosques and homes. Im sure we can do it ourselves. There is no need for foreigners to tell us this, Taliban spokesman Muslim Khan said.        
	The Taliban are currently engaged in peace talks with the Tehrik-e-Nifaz-e-Shariah Muhammadi, a group of religious hardliners that signed a deal with the North West Frontier Province government to usher in peace in Swat.        
	Since the signing of the peace deal, the TNSM has set up Islamic courts in Swat and appointed Qazis to preside over them. The TNSM has also said lawyers and civil judges will have no role in the Islamic courts.        
	Muslim Khan told IRIN, a news network run by the UN, that NGO is another name for vulgarity and obscenity. They dont want us to remain Muslims and want to take away the veil from our women.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Obama signs Pak bill
                                                                                                               Obama signs Pak bill
                            
	Washington, Oct. 15 (Reuters): President Barack Obama quietly signed a $7.5 billion aid bill for Pakistan today that drew criticism in the nuclear-armed South Asian country because of conditions linked to the assistance.        
	Obama signed the bill behind closed doors at the White House without a public ceremony before leaving on a trip to New Orleans.         
	The law provides $7.5 billion in non-military aid to Pakistan over five years. Pakistans military had complained because the legislation ties some funds to fighting militants and is seen by critics as violating sovereignty.        
	The US is the biggest aid donor to Pakistan and needs its help in hunting al Qaida leaders and stopping Islamist militants from crossing the border into Afghanistan to fight US-led forces there. The aid is designed to fund projects in Pakistan that include schools and roads, agricultural development, energy generation, water resource management and the judicial system.        
	The funding must still be allotted by Congress and the law must be renewed each year. The White House must certify that reasonable progress is being made to meet the objectives of the aid and give lists of recipients to Congress.        
	The Obama administration and US lawmakers spent most of this week trying to allay the concerns in Pakistan.

	Webcam Lopez    
	 London, Aug. 6 (PTI): Pop superstar and actress Jennifer Lopez keeps in touch with her twins Max and Emme through a webcam when she is away from home.      
	 The Maid in Manhattan star, who gave birth to the twins in February last year, misses them a lot and cannot bear to be parted from her family. So she uses the Internet to check on how they are doing.      
	I hate being away from my kids. But we have devised this thing where I can see them on the computer. I call up on the web camera so I can see the babies while I am away.

                                                                                                               Clock ticks on LTTE capital 
                                          
	Colombo, Jan. 1 (Agencies): Sri Lankan troops were poised to enter the de facto capital of the Tamil Tigers after capturing strategic areas around the town following heavy fighting with the rebels, the military said today.         
	Official sources said over 50 Tamil Tigers were killed and over 100 injured in the battle. Government troops captured Iranamadu junction, south of the rebels self-proclaimed capital of Kilinochchi, and Paranthan town to the north, from the LTTE, the military said.        
	The island nations army chief Sarath Fonseka said Kilinochchi would be captured within two days. The fall of Kilinochchi imminent within next 48 hours, the state-owned Daily News quoted Fonseka, in its breaking news via a mobile text message.        
	LTTE fighters put up a stiff resistance from Iranamadu junction.        
	The capture of Iranamadu junction and Paranthan will pave the way for government troops to move into the rebel capital for the first time in more than a decade, it said.        
	The troops today captured Iranamadu junction, said military spokesperson Brigadier Udaya Nanayakkara hours after the military announced the capture of Paranthan, a rebel-held town that controls a key land route to rebel strongholds in northern Jaffna .        
	Troops are moving in. There were heavy confrontations and terrorists were withdrawing with heavy casualties, Nanayakkara said.        
	Elephant Pass, which lies strategically at the neck of Jaffna peninsula, and Kilinochchi are now more vulnerable as the newly captured areas would cut off its main supply routes, Nanayakkara said.         
	The air force said fighter jets and M24 helicopters bombed three rebel positions, including a rebel command centre, today in support of the rapidly advancing ground troops.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Jindal popularity takes a hit, speech criticised
                                                                                                               Jindal popularity takes a hit, speech criticised
          SHAILA DEWAN                          Jindal                                  
	Washington, Feb. 26: Bobby Jindal, the Indian-origin governor of Louisiana, has been a rising star in the Republican Party, but his stock took a hit as he was roundly panned for his televised response to President Barack Obamas first speech to Congress on Tuesday night.        
	Conservative commentators were among the harshest critics, calling Jindals delivery animatronic, his prose cheesy and his message  that federal spending is not the answer to the nations economic problems  uninspired.         
	Jindal, 37, the son of Indian immigrants, has been regarded as a potential presidential candidate in 2012 who would bring diversity and youth to a post-Obama Republican Party. But the speech raised questions.         
	This was the moment for him to seize the mantle with new ideas, new direction, and lay the groundwork for himself as a creative new thinker, said Thomas Schaller, a political scientist at the University of Maryland, Baltimore County. He just used old platitudes and party clichs.        
	Laura Ingraham, the talk radio host; David Brooks, the New York Times columnist; and Juan Williams of Fox News were among Jindals unimpressed reviewers in television commentary, while Rush Limbaugh defended the governor on his radio show. Several commentators noted that response speeches, in which a designated member of the Opposition party delivers a short, canned speech with no live audience, have often been a recipe for failure.        
	He went in there with high expectations, probably too high for any politician, said David Johnson, a Republican political strategist.         
	Asked about the comments, Jindals chief of staff, Timmy Teepell, said that the governor was responding to Obama, whom he called one of the most gifted speakers in generations. I think the governor did a great job, Teepell said.        
	In his speech, Jindal said Republicans would work with Obama in areas where they agreed with him, and he offered a kind of apology for his party. You elected Republicans to champion limited government, fiscal discipline and personal responsibility, Jindal said. Instead, Republicans went along with earmarks and big government spending in Washington. Republicans lost your trust, and rightly so.

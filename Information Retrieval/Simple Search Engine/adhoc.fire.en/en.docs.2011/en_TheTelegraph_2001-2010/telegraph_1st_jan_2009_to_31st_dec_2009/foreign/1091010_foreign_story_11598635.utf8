	Peshawar, Oct. 9 (Reuters): A suspected suicide car-bomber killed 50 people today in Peshawar in an attack that the government said underscored the need for an all-out offensive against the Pakistani Taliban.        
	There was no claim of responsibility but interior minister Rehman Malik said all roads are leading to South Waziristan.        
	The suspected car-bomber set off his explosives as he was passing a bus, police said. The blast hurled the bus onto its side on a road in a commercial neighbourhood of the northwestern city. Several cars were destroyed.        
	The bus was making a turn when the blast occurred and it threw the bus into the air, a witness told Duniya Television. An official at Peshawars main hospital said 49 people had been killed including seven children. About 100 people were wounded.        
	Islamist militants who have set off numerous bombs in towns and cities including Peshawar over the past couple of years, most aimed at the security forces and government and foreign targets.        
	Early this year, the militants pushed to within 100km of Islamabad, raising fears for nuclear-armed Pakistans stability. An exasperated US secretary of state Hillary Clinton said the government appeared to be abdicating to the militants.

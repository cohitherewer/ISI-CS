The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Obama sets goals to cut emissions
                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      Obama sets goals to cut emissions

	Washington, Nov. 26: President Obama is pledging a provisional target for reductions in greenhouse gas emissions in the US, the first time in more than a decade that an American administration has offered even a tentative promise to reduce production of climate-altering gases, the White House announced yesterday.        
	In Beijing today, China unveiled its first firm target to curb greenhouse gas emissions, a carbon intensity goal that Premier Wen Jiabao will take to the international climate meeting in Copenhagen next month.        
	At the meeting, Obama will tell the delegates that the US intends to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions in the range of 17 per cent below 2005 levels by 2020 and 83 per cent by 2050, officials said.        
	The figures reflect targets specified by legislation that passed the House in June but is stalled in the Senate. Congress has never enacted legislation that includes firm emissions limits or ratified an international global warming pact with binding targets.        
	Obama will travel to the UN talks to deliver the promise in hopes of spurring significant progress there. He will appear December 9, near the beginning of the 12-day session, on his way to accept the Nobel Peace Prize in Oslo on December 10, officials said.        
	By making the pledge in an international forum, Obama is laying a bet that Congress will complete action on a climate bill next year and will be prepared to ratify an international agreement         
	But White House officials acknowledged that those outcomes were uncertain. They will depend in large measure on whether the Democratic sponsors of the legislation can win 60 votes for a measure that is at the moment unpopular and whether major developing nations, notably India, deliver credible emissions reduction pledges of their own.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Unbuttoned: Formal dress code at Oval
                                                                                                               Unbuttoned: Formal dress code at Oval
          SHERYL GAY STOLBERG                           Wheres the coat?                                  
	Washington, Jan. 29: The US capital flew into a bit of a tizzy when, on his first full day in the White House, President Barack Obama was photographed in the Oval Office without his suit jacket.         
	There was, however, a logical explanation: Obama, who hates the cold, had cranked up the thermostat.         
	Hes from Hawaii, OK? said Obamas senior adviser, David Axelrod. He likes it warm. You could grow orchids in there.         
	Thus did a rule of the George W. Bush administration  coat and tie in the Oval Office at all times  fall by the wayside, only the first of many signs that a more informal culture is growing up in the White House under new management.         
	Obama promised to bring change to Washington and he has  not just in substance, but in presidential style.         
	He shows up at the Oval Office shortly before 9 in the morning, roughly two hours later than his early-to-bed, early-to-rise predecessor. Obama likes to have his workout first thing in the morning, at 6.45.         
	He reads several papers, eats breakfast with his family and helps pack his daughters, Malia, 10, and Sasha, 7, off to school before making the 30-second commute downstairs.         
	He eats dinner with his family, then often returns to work; aides have seen him in the Oval Office as late as 10pm, reading briefing papers for the next day.         
	In the West Wing, Obama is a bit of a wanderer. When Bush wanted to see a member of his staff, the aide was summoned to the Oval Office. But Obama tends to roam the halls; one day last week, he turned up in the office of his press secretary, Robert Gibbs, who was in the unfortunate position of having his feet up on the desk when the boss walked in.         
	Wow, Gibbs, the press secretary recalled the President saying. Just got here and you already have your feet up. Gibbs scrambled to stand up, surprising Obama, who is not yet accustomed to having people rise when he enters a room.         
	Under Bush, punctuality was a virtue. Meetings started early and ended on time. In the Obama White House, meetings start on time and often finish late.         
	When the President invited Congressional leaders to 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue last week to talk about his stimulus package, the session ran so long that Obama wound up apologising to the lawmakers.         
	If Obamas clock is looser than Bushs, so too are his sartorial standards. Over the weekend, Obamas first in office, his aides did not quite know how to dress. Some showed up in jeans (another no-no under Bush). So the President issued an informal edict for business casual on weekends  and set his own example. He showed up on Saturday for a briefing with his chief economic adviser, Lawrence H. Summers, dressed in slacks and a grey sweater over a white buttoned-down shirt.

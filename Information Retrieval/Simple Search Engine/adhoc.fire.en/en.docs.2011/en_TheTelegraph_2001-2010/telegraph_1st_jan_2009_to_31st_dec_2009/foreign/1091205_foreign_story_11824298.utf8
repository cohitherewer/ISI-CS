The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | 46 killed in Bangla accident
                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      46 killed in Bangla accident
                            
	Dhaka, Dec. 4 (Reuters): An overcrowded ferry carrying nearly 100 passengers sank in a Bangladesh river after colliding with a motor launch today, killing at least 46 people just a week after another ferry disaster killed 87.        
	The ferry sank near Kishoreganj, about 150km northeast of Dhaka, police said.        
	Samarendra Dutta, a police sub-inspector, said from the site of the accident that the vessels apparently collided because of poor visibility. However, an investigation had been ordered to find out the exact cause. The death toll may go up as dozens of people remained unaccounted for, a Kishoreganj official said.        
	Ferry accidents kill hundreds of people in Bangladesh every year. They are usually caused by overcrowding and poor supervision and law enforcement. Bangladesh has called off efforts to salvage another ferry that sank with nearly 1,500 people in a river along the countrys south coast last Friday after rescuers found 87 bodies.

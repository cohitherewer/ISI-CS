The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Mexico flu smaller than feared
                                                                                                               Mexico flu smaller than feared

	New York, May 2: The World Health Organisation announced today an increase in the number of confirmed cases of swine flu, although tests now indicate that the outbreak in Mexico may turn out to be far smaller than originally feared.         
	The organisation said that 15 countries had reported a total of 615 cases of the infection, officially known as influenza A(H1N1), up from 367 cases late yesterday. But Mexico has found that a little more than half of its suspected cases subjected to detailed tests so far did not actually involve the virus.         
	Apparently the rate of infection is not as widespread as we might have thought, Jos ngel Crdova, Mexicos health minister, said, adding that this is a new epidemic, and we cant predict exactly what it will do. We need more days to see how it behaves.         
	Officials at the Centres for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta, which provided the tests to Mexico, declined to say what the new numbers might mean.        
	Of 908 suspected cases that were tested, only 397 people turned out to have the virus, officially known as influenza A(H1N1), Mexican health officials reported yesterday. Of those, 16 people have died. Initially, Mexico had reported as many as 2,500 suspected cases, but the number of actual cases could turn out to be less than half the suspected number if further testing follows the same pattern as the original round.         
	We are continuously assessing new information, but it is still too early to draw conclusions about the extent of the spread of this new virus in Mexico or the severity of disease caused by it, Nancy Cox, chief of the influenza section, said by email, when asked to comment on the test results.        
	 Javier Torres, the head of the infectious disease research unit at the Mexican Social Security Institute, Mexicos main public health care system, said that he had been analysing the past weeks influenza statistics.        
	The number of those exposed and infected has gone up, and the number of fatal cases has gone down, he said. We can be comfortable with those facts.        
	WHO officials, which has declared that a pandemic is imminent, declined to comment beyond saying that the investigation into the outbreak was continuing.        
	But a public health and infectious disease expert from Vanderbilt University, William Schaffner, said the test results were going to change, I think in a substantial way, the image of this outbreak in Mexico.        
	If the outbreak is much smaller than initially thought, Schaffner said, it would, I think, enable the worlds public health community to take a deep breath and continue to track the outbreak and reduce the tendency, as the WHO has been doing, to notch up on its pandemic scale.              
	If the testing also shows that the disease has caused fewer deaths than the approximately         
	170 suspected, he said, it might resolve a question that has been puzzling health experts:         
	why did the disease appear to be so much more severe in Mexico than in the United States? In         
	the United States, cases have been mild and there has been only one death, that of a         
	23-month-old child from Mexico.               
	The disease continued to spread to other countries and was confirmed in more American states         
	on Friday. The disease is expected to drop off during the summer, because flu viruses do not         
	thrive in heat and humidity, though it could rebound in the fall and winter.               
	New cases were reported in Denmark, France, Russia, Hong Kong and South Korea on Friday, but         
	they were not confirmed by the health organization. The United States reported 141 confirmed         
	cases in 19 states, up from 109 cases in 11 states on Thursday.              
	In Hong Kong, where a 25-year-old Mexican man spent seven hours on Thursday before being         
	hospitalized with East Asias first confirmed case of the new strain of influenza, squads of         
	police in green surgical masks stood guard outside the 19-story Metropark Hotel while about         
	300 guests and staff remained quarantined inside. Six police vans lined the streets         
	surrounding the hotel, including an enormous mobile police command post.              
	We are at the hotel across the street  we got up this morning to get a cup of coffee at         
	McDonalds and thought, what on Earth is happening? said Sue Old, a 62-year-old stationery         
	designer from Margaret River, Australia, who is in Hong Kong for a trade show.              
	Gabriel Matthew Leung, Hong Kongs undersecretary for food and health, said at a news         
	conference on Saturday evening that in addition to nearly 300 people quarantined, the         
	government was looking for about 50 guests who were not in the hotel when the quarantine was         
	imposed and did not return.               
	Most of those in the hotel have accepted with few complaints that they will be detained         
	there for a week, Mr. Leung said.              
	A couple people at the hotel have complained of minor fever, but the government has not         
	identified any further cases of influenza, said Dr. Thomas Tsang, the controller of the Hong         
	Kong governments Center for Health Prevention.              
	The government has also located all 36 passengers who were sitting within three rows of the         
	Mexican traveler on the flight that brought him here from Shanghai on Thursday, Dr. Tsang         
	said. All of these passengers  none with any signs of infection  have been placed in         
	isolation and are being monitored.              
	The World Health Organization said that the flu vaccine given to millions of people for the         
	most recent flu season appeared ineffective against the current strain, but that health         
	officials were talking to manufacturers about creating a new swine-flu vaccine, which would         
	take four to six months to produce. Officials at the Centers for Disease Control and         
	Prevention said a decision had not yet been made about whether to manufacture a vaccine, but         
	President Obama said that the government would support the effort.              
	Concerns about the disease are having an increasing effect. On Friday, a United Airlines         
	flight with 245 passengers heading from Munich to Dulles Airport in Washington landed in         
	Boston instead because a female passenger had flu symptoms and the airline thought she         
	needed prompt attention, a United Airlines spokesman said.              
	In New York, the school with the nations largest cluster of swine flu to date  St. Francis         
	Preparatory School in Fresh Meadows, Queens  was set to reopen Monday after being closed         
	for a week.              
	Researchers say that some genetic features of the virus may help explain why many cases tend         
	to be mild.              
	We do not see the markers for virulence that were seen in the 1918 virus, said Dr. Cox, of         
	the Centers for Disease Control. However, we know there is a great deal we dont understand         
	about the virulence of 1918 or other viruses that have a more severe clinical picture in         
	humans.              
	It is too early to know what economic effect, if any, the flu outbreak might have on the         
	United States economy. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that the recession will         
	push this years national economic output 7.5 percent below its potential level. A true flu         
	pandemic could shave off an additional 1 to 4.25 percent and could have a similar effect on         
	the worlds output, too, some economists say.

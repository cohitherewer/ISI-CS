                          Montazeri                    
	Tehran, Dec. 20 (Agencies): Irans most senior dissident cleric has died, prompting many supporters to flock to a holy city and raising the possibility that his funeral tomorrow could become a rallying point for the reformist Opposition.        
	Grand Ayatollah Hossein Ali Montazeri, a fierce critic of the hardline leadership who denounced Junes disputed election as fraudulent and emerged as the spiritual father of the reform movement, died on Sunday. He was 87.        
	Montazeri was named in the 1980s to succeed revolutionary leader Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini as Irans top authority, but fell out with him over the mass execution of prisoners.        
	One of Irans most senior clerics, he spent five years under house arrest until 2002 but remained a leading Opposition voice until his death, even though he rarely left his home in Qom.        
	The moderate Parlemannews web site said supporters of Montazeri, an architect of the 1979 Islamic revolution that toppled the US-backed Shah, were flocking to the Shia holy city of Qom to attend his funeral on Monday.        
	The reformist Tagheer website reported that pro-Opposition Iranians were gathering in squares of Tehran to mourn his death, and that riot police were seen in different parts of Qom, where Montazeri lived and died.        
	His death from a heart attack, reported by official media on Sunday, coincides with tension rising once again in the Islamic Republic, six months after the presidential poll plunged the major oil producer into political crisis. The pro-reform Opposition says the poll was rigged to secure hardline President Mahmoud Ahmadinejads re-election.        
	My grandfather died in his sleep last night. People and friends are coming to express their condolences but there are no special security measures around our house, Naser Montazeri told Reuters by phone from Qom, some 125km south of Tehran.        
	London-based Iran analyst Baqer Moin said: The amount of support shown to him will hearten the Opposition who are mourning his loss.         
	Video posted on the Internet showed people gathering to mourn Montazeri at universities in Tehran. A crowd chanted: Montazeri, congratulations on your freedom and oppressed Montazeri, we will follow your path.

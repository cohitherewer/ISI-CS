The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Taliban force Sikh exodus
                                                                                                               Taliban force Sikh exodus
                            
	Islamabad/Lahore, May 2 (PTI): Pakistani Hindu and Sikh families, who were being harassed by the Taliban for failing to pay religious tax, have left their homes in the North West Frontier Province and moved to Punjab.         
	Reacting to Indias concern over the treatment of Sikhs and Hindus by the Taliban, Pakistan today dismissed Indias verbal demarche on the issue. However, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh reminded Islamabad of its duty to protect all minorities. We have protested to the Pakistan government that the Sikh minority has not been treated properly, Singh told an Indian TV channel.        
	More than 150 Sikh and Hindu families have moved from NWFP and tribal areas to Punjab for shelter as the US branded the Taliban as ruthless killers for targeting the minority Sikhs. So far, over 150 Sikh and Hindu families have arrived at Gurdwara Panja Sahib in Hasan Abdal and Rawalpindi from places like Buner, Swat and Aurakzai Agency, Evacuee Trust Property Board chairman Asif Hashmi said today.         
	We have made arrangements for accommodation, food and security for the displaced Sikh and Hindu families in all five major gurdwaras in Punjab, he said.        
	Diplomatic sources said the issue of Sikhs being forced out of their homes in Aurakzai was brought to the notice of the foreign office by the Indian High Commission in Islamabad. It was also taken up with the Pakistani High Commission in New Delhi by the external affairs ministry.

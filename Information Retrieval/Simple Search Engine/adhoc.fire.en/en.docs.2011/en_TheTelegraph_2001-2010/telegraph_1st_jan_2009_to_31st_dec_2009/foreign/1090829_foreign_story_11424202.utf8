	Shakira hips    
	London, Aug. 28 (PTI): Popstar Shakira has a weird way of choosing her songs.       
	She gives a song the go ahead only if it makes her hips move because if she cant groove to the music no one else will. Im not a trained dancer. I did a little bit of gymnastics when I was 12  everything else its just me feeling the music, she said.      
	 When Im in the studio and Im producing my own music, Ive got to make sure I connect to it at a physical level. My body has to move and my hips have to move. If I dont see that kind of reaction, that physical reaction, then I know that something is not working.

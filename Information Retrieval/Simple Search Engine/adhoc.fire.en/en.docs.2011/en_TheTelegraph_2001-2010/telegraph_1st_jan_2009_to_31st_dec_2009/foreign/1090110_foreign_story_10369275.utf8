The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Army seizes key pass, aims for last Tiger base
                                                                                                               Army seizes key pass, aims for last Tiger base
                            
	Colombo, Jan. 9 (Reuters): Sri Lankan troops today handed the Tamil Tiger rebels their second major defeat in a week, capturing the strategic Elephant Pass, and are now gunning for the separatists last stronghold, the President said.        
	Today evening our troops liberated Elephant Pass fully, President Mahinda Rajapaksa said in a televised address, exactly a week after he announced the capture of the separatist rebels self-proclaimed capital of Kilinochchi.        
	Elephant Pass, site of one of the governments worst losses in the 25-year war, is as strategic as it is symbolic since the former army base is the gateway to the northern Jaffna Peninsula. Its capture also clears the LTTE off the main north-south A-9 road for the first time in 23 years, or nearly the entire war.        
	I need not explain to you that the A-9 route is symbolic of the unity that exists between the north and the south of our country. The LTTE obtained several million rupees from the fraudulent taxes they imposed, he said.         
	The seizure puts most of ethnically Tamil Jaffna in government hands for the first time since the battle in 2000 that killed 359 soldiers.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | PM onus on Nepal House
                                                                                                               PM onus on Nepal House
                            
	Kathmandu, May 10 (Reuters): Nepals President Ram Baran Yadav today asked the Himalayan nations parliament to elect a new leader to replace Maoist Prime Minister Prachanda who resigned last week after failing to sack the army chief.        
	The move came hours after a deadline for political parties to form a government with the consensus of all parties, including the Maoists, expired.        
	Election of a new leader will not be easy because the Maoists, who control 40 per cent of parliament seats, have vowed to disrupt parliament sittings. Old enmity and mistrust between the other political parties make the task of choosing a leader even more difficult.        
	Yadav, who is not a Maoist, asked a special Constituent Assembly that also doubles as Nepals parliament to elect a new Prime Minister to resolve the political crisis.        
	There is no deadline to choose a new leader, said Suresh Adhikary, a spokesperson for the President. It is up to the parliament to decide.

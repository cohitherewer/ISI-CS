                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      Maoists plan 13 parallel govts
                              Baburam Bhattarai                            
	Kathmandu, Nov. 27 (PTI): The Nepal Maoists today decided to declare 13 parallel regional governments in a bid to overthrow the coalition regime.        
	The decision came as Maoist chief Prachanda met President Ram Baran Yadav who has been accused by the former rebels of violating civilian supremacy over the military by reinstating General Rukmangad Katawal.         
	The vice-chairman of the Communist Party of Nepal (Maoists), Baburam Bhattarai, today announced the decision to declare 13 parallel governments after the Maoists lifted their five-month blockade of the parliament to allow the passage of the 2009 budget.        
	The Maoists argue that Yadavs reinstatement of Katawal, who was dismissed by Prachanda as army chief in May, is unconstitutional.         
	According to Maoist journal Janadisha, the former rebels have decided to hold rallies across 13 regions of the country from December 11 to 18 in protest against Yadavs decision.        
	The Maoists have around 40 per cent of the seats in the parliament.        
	At his 90-minute meeting with Yadav, Prachanda said the Maoists were keen to end the current political deadlock that has stalled the peace process in the country.        
	Yadav told Prachanda he wanted the parties to move forward and complete the draft of the Constitution on time, the Presidents press adviser, Rajendra Dahal, said.        
	Yadav said he was willing to work with the parties to end the deadlock and forge a consensus on key political issues.         
	Sources close to Yadav said Prachanda wanted to gauge the mood of the President on the current political situation.        
	Prachanda said his party was not against Yadav personally but had been forced to launch an agitation against the reinstatement of Katawal, sources close to the Maoist leader said.        
	The former Prime Minister said his party was commited to resolve the current political stalemate.

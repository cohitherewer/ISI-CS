The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | The rich voice that will be heard but not seen
                                                                                                               The rich voice that will be heard but not seen
          MICHAEL E. RUANE                           Courtney Williams                                  
	Washington, Jan. 19: Just before noon tomorrow, a magisterial voice  rich and befitting the moment  will utter to the multitude spread before the Capitol the words: Ladies and gentlemen, the President-elect of the United States... Barack H. Obama.        
	There will be a careful pause between states and Obama. The Bs in the President-elects name will be perfectly enunciated. The words will be spoken as if from a patriarch, heard from on high, and broadcast across America and several countries in the world.        
	No one in the throng will be able to see the man standing at a microphone in an open Capitol doorway. The man himself, wearing a headset filled with background chatter, might be unable to hear the crowds roar as his introduction echoes across the Mall. But his words will become part of history.        
	The disembodied voice of God for tomorrows swearing-in ceremony, one of the deepest voices in the vocal spectrum  a second bass  flavoured with faintest hint of Tennessee, belongs to Navy Musician 1st Class Courtney Williams, 33, a postal carriers son from Greenbrier, Tennessee.        
	Gifted with a deep, Ol Man River-type singing voice, he is normally the official concert narrator for the 99-piece US Navy Band. It is a behind-the-scenes job in which he gives oral programme notes at musical performances, wreath-laying ceremonies, change of command ceremonies, arrival ceremonies, balls and retirements. He is a former high school band geek with a yen for country music.        
	Williams has never announced an inauguration. He said he believes he got the assignment because his work was known to military officials who helped plan the inaugural ceremonies. I was thrilled, he said. The job requires a tone of authority, but not command; formality, with a touch of drama. He must inject a spark of electricity into his LAY-dees and GEN-tel-mun without sounding like a game show host.        
	You want the emphasis in the right places, he said. You want to build excitement.        
	And you dare not mess up. Mainly, he will be introducing people: members of Congress, dignitaries, present and former high-ranking government officials. All names must be pronounced correctly, and there are about 30 introductions. He will start about 10 am, introducing the San Francisco Boys and Girls choruses, and will announce Obama about 90 minutes later. The President-elect will be sworn in moments afterwards.         
	The pause before Obamas name in the introduction must be done judiciously.        
	You want the pause for dramatic effect. But if its too long, the crowd may be cheering and screaming so much they never even hear the name, Williams said. So I may not rush through it but not leave as much time in the gap. The Bs, As and the M in the President-elects name are fun to pronounce. His name lends itself well to being announced, Williams said.

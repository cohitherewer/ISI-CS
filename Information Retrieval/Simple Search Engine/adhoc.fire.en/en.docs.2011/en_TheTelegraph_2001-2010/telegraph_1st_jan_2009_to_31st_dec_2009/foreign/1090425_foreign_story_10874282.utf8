The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Tiger boss eyes sub, says army
                                                                                                               Tiger boss eyes sub, says army
          DEAN NELSON                          Prabhakaran: On the run                                  
	Colombo, April 24: Tamil Tiger leader Velupillai Prabhakaran is planning to flee his last rebel stronghold in a submarine, it has been claimed.         
	Sri Lankan Navy chiefs are said to have been informed of the plan by a senior rebel figure who surrendered earlier this week.         
	Army commanders have vowed to destroy the LTTE chief and today said they had confirmed he was still within the five square mile no-fire zone on the islands northeast coast.         
	Rumours of a secret escape plan emerged amid growing concern for the safety of thousands of civilians who remain trapped inside the safe zone.         
	A leaked UN report claimed 6,500 civilians had been killed in fighting since January with 5,500 of them inside the no-fire zone.         
	The flight of civilians from the zone appeared to have slowed significantly yesterday, according to western diplomats who said fierce fighting between the army and LTTE rebels was continuing.         
	Drone reconnaissance planes were understood to be flying over the zone to identify Prabhakarans exact location as the government vowed to continue its assault on the Tigers last bolt-hole until they surrender.         
	Sri Lankan ministers are expected to come under renewed pressure from India, which has sent its foreign secretary and national security adviser to Colombo to try to persuade the government to halt its offensive.         
	Ministers and army commanders remain focused on securing a victory which had eluded them in 25 years of war.         
	Brigadier Shavendra Silva revealed that Daya Master, a leading Tiger figure who served as an LTTE spokesman, had told his interrogators of Prabharakans plan to escape by submarine.         
	Prabhakaran might have retained a submarine to escape from the island. This was revealed by LTTEs former spokesman Daya Master, who surrendered to the army this week, said Silva in Kilinochchi, the former rebel capital.         
	He said Master had revealed that only two senior Tiger leaders now remained loyal to Prabhakaran, but the others would leave him if they could.         
	Western diplomats in Colombo said the LTTE had acquired a number of semi-submersible vessels for weapons smuggling and had been working on small rudimentary submarines.

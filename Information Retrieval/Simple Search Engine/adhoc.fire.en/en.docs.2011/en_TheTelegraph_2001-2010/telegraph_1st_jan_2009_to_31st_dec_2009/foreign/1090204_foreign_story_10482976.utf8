The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Blow to Obama as Daschle pulls out
                                                                                                               Blow to Obama as Daschle pulls out

	Washington, Feb. 3: Thomas A. Daschle, President Obamas choice to be secretary of health and human services, has withdrawn his nomination, White House officials announced shortly after noon.        
	Daschle cited the distractions that followed his failure to pay all of his taxes in recent years. His decision came as another prominent Obama nominee, Nancy Killefer, withdrew her nomination to be chief performance officer because of similar  and in fact smaller  tax lapses.        
	Had Daschle been confirmed, he would have been one of the best-connected cabinet secretaries in this administration.         
	Daschle, a former Senate majority leader, had come under pressure since Friday, when it was reported that he did not pay more than $100,000 in back taxes, primarily for the use of a car and driver that was given to him by an associate. He yesterday met members of the Senate Finance Committee to explain the omission and apologised.         
	But some Republicans had questioned whether the nomination should go forward and his confirmation vote has been postponed until at least the middle of next week. Obama said yesterday that he supported Daschles nomination absolutely.        
	But after days of mounting questions about the apparent ethical loopholes in the new administration, the President said today that he had accepted Daschles decision to withdraw. This morning, Tom Daschle asked me to withdraw his nomination, Obama said in a statement. I accept his decision with sadness and regret. Obama said Daschle had devoted his life to public service and health care reform, so that every American has access to health care they can afford.        
	But, Obama said: Tom made a mistake, which he has openly acknowledged. He has not excused it, nor do I. But that mistake, and this decision, cannot diminish the many contributions Tom has made to this country, from his years in the military to his decades of public service.        
	Daschle, in a statement, said being chosen for the post had been one of the signal honours of an improbable career. But if 30 years of exposure to the challenges inherent in our system has taught me anything, it has taught me that this work will require a leader who can operate with the full faith of Congress and the American people, and without distraction, Daschle said.         
	Daschle had been appointed to two posts  both the HHS secretary and the health care czar, with an office at the White House. He will not serve in either job, officials said. I will not be the architect of Americas health care reform, but I remain one of its most fervent supporters, Daschle said. Key lawmakers were barely given notice of Daschles decision. Senator Max Baucus, chairman of the finance committee, who gave his support to Daschle after a 75-minute meeting yesterday, said he was told 15 minutes before the news broke.        
	The tone was almost collegial, it was not acrimonious, Baucus said of the meeting, during which senators spent an hour reviewing the report on Daschles finances and then met him personally behind closed doors. Based on that meeting, Im a little surprised by Senator Daschles decision, Baucus said.        
	Senator Richard Durbin, the Senate Democratic whip, said Daschle did the honorable thing. Dachles situation was only one of three tax controversies surrounding Obama nominees. Treasury secretary Timothy F. Geithner also acknowledged tax mistakes but he was eventually confirmed by the Senate.        
	Killefer indicated that controversy over failure to pay taxes by Daschle and Geithner had persuaded her to decline the new Presidents request to join his administration. Killefer had a tax lien placed on her house by the government in 2005 because she had not paid taxes for her household help.

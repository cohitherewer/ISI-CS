The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Nepal regrets priest attack
                                                                                                               Nepal regrets priest attack
                            
	Kathmandu/New Delhi, Sept. 5 (PTI): Nepal today said the attack by Maoists on two Indian priests at Pashupatinath temple was most regrettable and stepped up security for the pujaris.         
	Yesterday, India had condemned the attack as an unprovoked and criminal act.        
	This is very sad and most regrettable to attack Indian priests inside the holy temple, which is not only the centre of faith for millions of Nepalese and Indians, but also for Hindus across the world, Nepals culture minister Minendra Rijal said.        
	Yesterday, Girish Bhatta and Raghavendra Bhatta, both from Karnataka, were beaten up by 40 to 50 Maoists who entered the shrine posing as devotees. The former rebels, protesting the appointment of the two priests, tore their clothes and cut their sacred thread.         
	Twenty-four people, including a leader of the group that beat up the priests, have been arrested so far, officials said.        
	The two priests, appointed by Prime Minister Madhav Kumar Nepal, initiated the Nitya Puja at the temple today.        
	The chief priest of Pashupatinath temple, Mahabaleshwor Bairy, today said he and his four colleagues would rather return to India than face humiliation. The newly appointed Indian priests are not refugees taking shelter at the temple, he said.        
	Foreign minister S.M. Krishna said India was in touch with the Nepal government. They have enhanced security around the temple and they have provided enough security to the priests where they stay and where they operate.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Hu Jintaos G8 exit sparks debate
                                                                                                               Hu Jintaos G8 exit sparks debate
          SANKARSHAN THAKUR                              
	LAquila, July 9: A day after he suddenly left for home, Chinese President Hu Jintaos departure remains the subject of much speculation and debate here, both open and hushed.         
	What was it really that sucked the Chinese leader away from the G8/G7 high tables here? A mere eruption of ethnic Uighur-Han tensions in the northwestern province of Xinjiang, or is it a deeper, more intractable ethnic crisis that the Chinese cant seem to get a hold on? Is Urumqui, the Xinjiang capital, becoming the new Lhasa?        
	Nobody quite seems to have a clear sense of how serious the Uighur-Han clashes have turned, or how the implications may play out, but most are assuming that Jintao would not have left had it been just another round in the long chain of violent incidents.         
	Intelligent speculation, as one diplomat put it, was that things are much more serious in Xinjiang than available information suggests, the toll could be much higher than reports emerging from China suggest.         
	Hu Jintaos move has alerted Indian antennae like probably nothing else at the Summit, some officials even betraying a sudden sense of relish at Chinas domestic discomfitures. They seem to be in big trouble, one of them chuckled, can you imagine Jintao having to leave a summit like this, it is nothing short of embarrassing.        
	There has been speculation in some quarters at the Summit that Jintao may have used the Xinjiang crisis to send subtle signals that it didnt put too much premium on deliberations at the LAquila summit and, therefore, didnt think much of reducing its protocol presence by leaving special envoy Dai Bingguo in charge.         
	The Chinese, on their part, have been denying any such suggestion and maintain that it was domestic issues that took Hu Jintao away. Nothing to do with this summit, nothing at all, said a member of the Chinese delegation, You must realise China is a big country and some things might need our leaders urgent attention.        
	But having taken that position, the Chinese are also being typically opaque about how serious the ethnic crisis in Xinjiang may be. We are here in Italy, very far from China, is how one Chinese delegate batted off queries about how serious the Urumqui clashes could be, All we can say is it needs attention and that is the only reason why our President has gone.

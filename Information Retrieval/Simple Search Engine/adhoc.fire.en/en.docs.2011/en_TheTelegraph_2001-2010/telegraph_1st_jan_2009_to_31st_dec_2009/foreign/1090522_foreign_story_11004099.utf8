The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Lanka to devolve powers to Tamil areas
                                                                                                               Lanka to devolve powers to Tamil areas

	Colombo, May 21 (PTI): Sri Lanka today assured India that it will implement a law for devolving powers to Tamil-dominated areas as both countries agreed on the need for a lasting political solution to the ethnic conflict.         
	The assurance was contained in a joint statement issued after national security adviser M.K. Narayanan and foreign secretary Shivshankar Menon met President Mahinda Rajapaksa here, three days after LTTE chief Velupillai Prabhakaran was killed and the country was declared free of terrorism.         
	Sri Lanka and India agreed that with the end of the military operations, the time was right to focus attention on relief, rehabilitation, resettlement and reconciliation, including a permanent political solution in Sri Lanka.        
	Menon told reporters after the meeting that Sri Lanka appeared willing to go beyond the 1987 Indo-Sri Lanka Peace Accord which for the first time set up a devolution plan for the ethnically-divided nation.         
	Our discussions were within the framework of the Indo-Sri Lanka Peace agreement. The President is not only willing to implement the 13th Amendment (set up under the Rajiv Gandhi-Jayawardene accord) but is willing to go the extra mile, he said.         
	Menon and Narayanan, who arrived here yesterday, had a breakfast meeting with the President at his Temple Trees residence in Colombo.        
	 The two also met senior officials and Basil Rajapaksa, the Presidents brother and senior adviser, Lalith Weerathunga, the Presidents secretary, and defence secretary Gotabaya Rajapaksa. Menon and Narayanan later left for New Delhi.         
	The envoys said the Lankan government outlined a 180-day plan to resettle tens of thousands of civilians who were displaced by the fighting between security forces and the LTTE.         
	India was willing to cooperate closely with the Sri Lankans in reconstruction and rehabilitation as well as demining of areas for resettling civilians in their towns and villages.         
	The Lankans said India had offered support for the huge reconstruction effort and was keen to ensure that civilians returned from the camps for the internally displaced at the earliest.         
	Both sides emphasised the urgent need to resettle the refugees in their towns and villages and to provide them with necessary basic and civic infrastructure.        
	Refugee abductions        
	Tamil paramilitary groups have abducted displaced children from northern Sri Lanka, holding some for ransom and apparently questioning others for suspected ties to the defeated Tamil Tigers, human rights groups said.         
	The government denied it was giving the groups access to the fenced-in camps. An estimated 280,000 civilians were displaced in the offensive.

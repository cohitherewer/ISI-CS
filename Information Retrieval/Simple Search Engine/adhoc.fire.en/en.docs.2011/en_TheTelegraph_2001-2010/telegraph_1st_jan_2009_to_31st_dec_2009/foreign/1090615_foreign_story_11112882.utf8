	Barmaid Kylie           
	 London, June 14 (PTI): Pop diva Kylie Minogue recently spent a night serving drinks and washing glasses at a bar in Spain.           
	The bar, at a medieval castle in Spains Tossa de Mar town, which belongs to the Australian popstars boyfriend Andres Velencosas parents, was running short of a bartender. The singer happily volunteered to lend a helping hand.           
	The bar was a man down and was getting quite busy. Kylie proved shes no diva by volunteering to help. She had no qualms about getting stuck in, and spent most of the night washing glasses, Daily Mail quoted a source as saying.     
	Slow storm           
	 London: An insurance company in the UK has refused to pay out for repairs to a home hit by bad weather because the wind was too slow. Douglas Graham, 64, claimed for damage caused by storms in March, which weakened the lead flashing lining the roof and resulted in a leak. However, Halifax Insurance told him it would not pay out because the wind measured only 44mph, defining it as a gale. In the insurers policy, a storm has winds of at least 55mph.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Husband faces jail as Goody awaits last days
                                                                                                               Husband faces jail as Goody awaits last days
          AMIT ROY                              
	London, March 3: There are two sides to 21-year-old Jack Tweed  one is the violent thug and the other is the caring boyfriend who did the decent thing by marrying his girlfriend, Jade Goody, formerly of Celebrity Big Brother, during her last days.        
	Today, at Epping Magistrates Court in Essex, the former was in evidence. Tweed was found guilty of attacking Stephen Wilkins, a local taxi driver, last May. Although Tweed denied the offence, he was convicted of threatening to stab Wilkins who had asked for his fare in advance.        
	 Nor is this Tweeds first violent offence. In September last year he was given an 18-month jail sentence by a judge at Chelmsford Crown Court after being found guilty of hitting a 16-year-old boy with a golf club.        
	 He was released from prison on licence in January on compassionate grounds and is compelled to wear a monitoring tag and observe a 7pm curfew  which means he cannot visit Jade in hospital after that hour.        
	 Magistrates today warned Tweed they were considering adding to his jail term but adjourned sentencing until March 26 so reports can be prepared on his background.        
	 Tweed wept in the dock today as his lawyer Tania Panagiotopoulou outlined details of Goodys condition to the court. She claimed that because of Jades condition, Tweed was a changed man.        
	 His partying lifestyle is well and truly over and has been for some months now, she said. He tries within the confines of his tag to care for her. He is unable to work.        
	 Panagiotopoulou added: She has been given less than four weeks to live. Yesterday Wilkins, who is in his 50s, told the court that he picked up Tweed  and three other people  outside a nightclub in Epping in the early hours of May 5 last year.        
	 Tweed became aggressive after being asked to pay the fare in advance.        
	Wilkins said Tweed, who was sitting behind him, grabbed him in a headlock and threatened to stab him.        
	 He was leaning over me, over the back of my seat, with his face alongside my face screaming, I will stab you, you f****** c***, Wilkins told the court. He was spitting in my face saying, I will bite your f****** head off. I have, as a taxi driver, picked up a lot of people who are aggressive but never as aggressive as this.        
	 Tweed told police he had been drinking all day before going to the club where he consumed 10 vodka and Red Bulls plus a couple of shots. He said he had no memory of the taxi journey.        
	 Meanwhile, 27-year-old Jade underwent overnight emergency surgery at Londons Chelsea and Westminster Hospital to help relieve agonising stomach pains. She has been informed that her cancer, which started in her cervix last year, had already been found in her liver, groin and bowel and had even spread to her brain.        
	 The publicist Max Clifford, who has been acting as Jades spokesman, said that, despite knowing she was dying, Jade was coping remarkably well.        
	 He said: In terms of her spirit, she has been very brave and positive. Its only when she is in considerable pain that she has been sobbing. Other than that, she has been very upbeat and is looking forward to the christening of her sons.        
	 She hopes to have herself and her sons Bobby, five, and Freddie, four, christened this Saturday.

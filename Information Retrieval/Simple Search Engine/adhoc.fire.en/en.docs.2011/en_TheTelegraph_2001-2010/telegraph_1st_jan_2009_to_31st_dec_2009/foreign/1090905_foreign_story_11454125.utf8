	Giselle secrets    
	 Los Angeles, Sept. 4 (PTI): Supermodel Gisele Bundchen is all set to share her trade secrets with husband, American football star Tom Brady, by teaching him how to pose and preen in front of the camera.      
	Brady, who married Bundchen in February, doesnt feel comfortable posing for photo shoots and hopes the model will boost his confidence in front of the camera.      
	 When I am out on the football field I have so much confidence in what I am doing. With photo shoots, I dont know what I am doing. Im at the whim of the photographer and the crew, Brady said. I should probably ask her for some help.

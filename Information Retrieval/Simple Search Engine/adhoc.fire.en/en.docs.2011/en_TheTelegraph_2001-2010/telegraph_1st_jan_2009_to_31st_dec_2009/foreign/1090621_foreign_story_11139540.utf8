          ANTHEE CARASSAVA                          Journalists walk among statues during a tour of the new Acropolis Museum in Athens. (AP)                                  
	Athens, June 20: On Monday morning, forklifts nosed through a sprawl of antiquities in the second-floor gallery of the New Acropolis Museum here, bearing marble statues .         
	Technicians tugged at bulky black cables, labourers drilled and welded, and a cleaning crew  many of its members working on hands and knees  scraped mounds of white plaster off the floor.        
	My apologies, said Antonis Samaras, Greeces culture minister, who was overseeing the final preparations for the museums debut. But its like the Olympics, he added, referring to the 2004 Athens Games. Everything will magically come together on opening night.        
	If it does, Greece will finally, after decades of preparation, procrastination and acrimonious debate, have a large-scale, architecturally ambitious and modern centre for the care and display of artifacts from its most important ancient site.        
	 The museum, which cost $200 million and sits near the base of the Acropolis with a direct view of the Parthenon, is one of the highest-profile cultural projects undertaken in Europe in this decade.         
	Intended as the ultimate showcase of classical civilisation, Samaras said, it was built to promote tourism and, like any large, government-financed museum, to stir national pride. But it was also meant, not incidentally, to spark discomfort in another country in the EU.         
	We didnt build this for the sake of the British, Samaras said in an interview, adding at once, but look around: does this not negate the argument that Athens has no place good enough to house the Parthenon Marbles?        
	For more than 30 years, Greece has been working, through diplomacy and public relations offensives, to regain the Elgin Marbles, sections of a decorative frieze that adorned the Parthenon until Lord Elgin ordered them removed in the early 19th century during his tenure as British ambassador to the Ottoman Empire. Years later, bankrupt, he sold them to the British Museum where they have been a major attraction since 1816.        
	Today, almost two centuries on, many Greeks hope the opening of the museum will focus international attention on their countrys claim to the so-called Elgin Marbles, and put an end to Britains longtime argument that it is in a better position to look after those 2,500-year-old panels.         
	Last week the Greek government turned down an offer from the British Museum for a three-month loan of the collection, because it came with the condition that the Greeks formally acknowledge British ownership. This is a nonstarter for any discussion, Samaras said. No Greek can sign up to that.         
	The new museum, 226,000 square feet of glass and concrete designed by the New York architect Bernard Tschumi, replaces the old Acropolis Museum, a small 1874 building tucked into the rock of the Acropolis next to the Parthenon.         
	The design, introduced in 2001, was meant to be completed in time for the 2004 Olympics, but dozens of legal battles  many having to do with some 25 buildings that were demolished to make room for it  delayed the process for years.         
	Even now, not all Athenians are happy with the building, wedged in as it is among apartment buildings in a middle-class residential district. It is as if a titanic UFO landed in the neighbourhood, obliterating all of its surrounding structures, said Nikos Dimou, a prominent Greek author.         
	The museum has five floors (including two basement levels that will not be open at first), which provide space for 4,000 artifacts, 10 times the number displayed in the old building.

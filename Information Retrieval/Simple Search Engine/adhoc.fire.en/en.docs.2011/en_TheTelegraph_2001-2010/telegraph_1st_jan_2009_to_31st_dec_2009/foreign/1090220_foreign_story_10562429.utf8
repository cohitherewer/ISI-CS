	Ledger puzzle    
	London, Feb. 19: If Heath Ledger is named best supporting actor at Sundays Academy Awards ceremony, his three-year-old daughter, Matilda Rose Ledger, will inherit the prized Oscar statuette  but not until her 18th birthday and then only if she signs a contract, reports The Daily Telegraph.       
	The actor died of an accidental overdose of prescription drugs last year at the age of 28. His nomination for his role as the Joker in The Dark Knight and his daughters young age have led to one of the trickiest situations the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences has dealt with in its eight decades of awarding posthumous Oscars.       
	Academy tradition calls for a posthumous statuette to go to the spouse, or, if there is no living spouse, to the oldest child. Ledger was not married, and Matilda is his only child.       
	But because she is only three, Matilda is legally unable to sign the winners agreement. The agreement is the academys way of limiting what might otherwise be a lively secondary market in Oscars.

	Putin for Beatles    
	 London, Feb. 10: Vladimir Putin has denied that he attended a secret Abba tribute concert last month, insisting that he prefers The Beatles, reports The Daily Telegraph.       
	The British-based Bjorn Again band said last week that they performed a private gig for the Russian Prime Minister and eight friends at a theatre in a Russian holiday resort.       
	But Putins spokesman has taken the unusual step of writing to a British newspaper to deny the reports, and insist the Prime Minister was too busy to have attended the January 22 concert.      
	I dont know who their audience consisted of, but Vladimir Putin was not one of them, Dmitry Peskov wrote to The Times. He was actually working in his office that Thursday evening, meeting members of the cabinet. The spokesman said he was sorry to disappoint the tribute act, but added: Mr Putin is more of a Beatles fan than an Abba one, as you can see if you read an interview by Andrew Lloyd Webber with Mr Putin on our website.

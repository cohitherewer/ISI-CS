	Eminem Relapse    
	 New York, May 21 (Reuters): Rap singer Eminems first studio album in four years focuses more on his drug problems than rants against celebrities and relatives, but the newfound introspection is not expected to block his rise up the charts.      
	Relapse was released worldwide this week and is likely to debut at number one on the US pop charts next week, as have the 36-year-old hip hop stars previous four albums. Trade publication Billboard said Relapse could sell as many as 650,000 copies across the US in its first week, making it the biggest debut so far this year. Final data will be released next Wednesday.

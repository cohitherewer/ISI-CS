  - Likely political beneficiaries miss the bus in Europe        CRAIG WHITLOCK                                                
	Hanover, Sept. 6: Among the victims of the Great Recession are Europes big-government, welfare-loving socialist parties, which so far have been unable to exploit voter anxiety over the perils of runaway capitalism.         
	In Germany, which will hold national elections on September 27, the pro-labour Social Democrats are headed to their worst showing in at least a generation, paving the way for the easy re-election of Chancellor Angela Merkel.         
	Despite public anger over rising joblessness and the souring of attitudes toward unregulated markets, the story is similar for Left-wing parties across Europe.         
	In France, the Socialist Party is in tatters and poses little threat to President Nicolas Sarkozy. In Italy, the weakness of the Left Opposition has helped Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi, a billionaire, weather a series of personal scandals. In Britain, voters are poised to toss out the Labour Party.         
	Social Democrats in Europe have warned for years of the dangers of untamed markets and unchecked globalisation. Although some of their predictions have proved prescient in the aftermath of the financial meltdown, they have struggled to convince voters that they have the tools or expertise to fix ailing economies.         
	In Germany, Frank-Walter Steinmeier, the Social Democrats candidate for Chancellor and Merkels chief rival, unveiled a plan last month to create four million jobs and bring full employment to the country by 2020. But surveys found that only one in seven Germans found the proposal believable. Pundits mocked it as a modern-day version of the five-year plans that never worked in communist East Germany.         
	The main problem is that people think the Social Democrats have no economic competence, said Manfred Guellner, the chief pollster for a German survey firm. They have this impression that they cannot rule, cannot govern.         
	The Social Democrats are the junior partner in a coalition government led by Merkels Christian Democrats. Merkel is hoping to ditch the Social Democrats and form a new government with the Free Democrats, a smaller party that favours pro-business policies.         
	At a campaign kickoff rally on Monday in Hanover, the mood among Social Democrats was grim. The crowd of about 4,000 people barely mustered polite applause when Steinmeier took the stage.         
	Steinmeier, who is Germanys foreign minister, conceded he faced an uphill battle.         
	Steinmeiers primary challenge is that Merkel remains highly popular among voters, who credit her with adopting sensible middle-of-the-road policies while shying away from overly partisan politics.

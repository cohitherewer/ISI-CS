	Mother Cruz    
	 London, July 8 (PTI): Oscar-winning actress Penelope Cruz may not believe in the concept of marriage but the star wants to be the best mother when she starts her family.      
	 Cruz said that she does plan to start a family one day and it could be at the expense of her acting career because she wants to be the best mother in the world. I want to have babies one day but not right now. When I do it I want to do it really well. I want it to be my best project in life. I dont know if I believe in marriage. I believe in family, love and children, Cruz said.     
	Gere Dog    
	 Tokyo (AP): Richard Gere stars in a Hollywood remake of Japans long-cherished story of Hachiko, a faithful dog that died at a train station waiting for its master. But Hachi: A Dogs Story is more about the dog than about Gere, the 59-year-old actor said on Wednesday. On this movie, I was definitely second-class, he told reporters in Tokyo.

	Islamabad, April 22: Pakistani Taliban militants have dug bunkers and trenches to tighten their grip in Buner district which they occupied in the past few days.         
	According to media reports today, armed militants have set up checkpoints and are patrolling markets, villages and towns in the district, located just 100km from Islamabad.        
	They are now reportedly advancing towards Swabi, Malakand and Mardan, the hometown of North West Frontier Province chief minister Amir Haider Khan Hoti.         
	In Washington today, US secretary of state Hillary Rodham Clinton said the Pakistani government is abdicating to the Taliban by allowing extremists to impose Islamic law in parts of the country.        
	Clinton said in a congressional hearing that she believes the government has given the Taliban sway over parts of the country because it is no longer credible to many of its citizens.         
	The militants, who sneaked into Buner on April 4, have been on a looting spree for the past five days. They have robbed government and NGO offices of vehicles, computers, generators, food and nutrition packets, the Dawn newspaper reported.         
	Politicians, businessmen and NGOs,who played a role in raising the lashkar or tribal militia against the Taliban, have been forced to flee Buner to other areas. The district was earlier a stronghold of the secular Awami National Party that rules the NWFP.

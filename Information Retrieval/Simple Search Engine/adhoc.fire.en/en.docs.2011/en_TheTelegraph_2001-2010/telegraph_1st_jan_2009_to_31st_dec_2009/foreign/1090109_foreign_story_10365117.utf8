	Porn pair bailout    
	 Los Angeles, Jan. 8: Porn baron Larry Flynt is seeking a $5 billion bailout from Washington to rejuvenate the industry, which he says is suffering because of the economic downturn.       
	The Hustler magazine founder has teamed up with fellow adult entertainment mogul Joe Francis, creator of the Girls Gone Wild video series, to approach Congress for the same kind of financial assistance recently approved for car manufacturers.       
	The pair have asked the 111th Congress to rejuvenate the sexual appetite of America with a bailout.

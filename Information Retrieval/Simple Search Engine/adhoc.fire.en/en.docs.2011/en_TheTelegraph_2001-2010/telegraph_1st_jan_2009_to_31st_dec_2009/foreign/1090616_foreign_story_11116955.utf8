	Los Angeles, June 15 (PTI): Paris Hilton may be dreaming of ousting the Beckhams by pairing up with football star Cristiano Ronaldo, but the socceer star has already moved on to other women after enjoying a brief romance with the socialite.        
	The ace, who has just signed a record transfer deal worth 94 million euros, was seen partying with a number of women in Las Vegas, reported People magazine.        
	The 24-year-old Portugese striker was photographed flirting with a mystery brunette at a posh Los Angeles club, and then quickly chatted up another blonde.        
	 Ronaldo was the talk of the club because everyone had read about his nights out with Paris. But this dark-haired girl wandered into the roped off VIP part and caught Ronaldos eye immediately.         
	They were flirting outrageously and he was lapping up the attention, an onlooker told the magazine.        
	 Ronaldo, who has spent the past week celebrating his move to Spanish club Real Madrid is staying at the Palms Casino resort in Vegas and was spotted escorting two of the girls to his 5,400 a night suite.         
	 The news is sure to dash hotel heiress Hiltons hopes for a romance. The 28-year-old Hilton was earlier reported to be planning a move to Madrid so that she could spend time with Ronaldo.         
	The heiress wanted Ronaldo and herself to become a bigger sensation than star couple David and Victoria Beckham. She has reportedly wooed the soccer ace by telling him that they could be more famous than the former Spice Girl and her footballer husband, News of the World said.

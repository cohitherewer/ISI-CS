The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Pak swoop on Taliban hub
                                                                                                               Pak swoop on Taliban hub
                            
	Kota (Pakistan), May 12 (Reuters): Helicopter-borne Pakistani soldiers swooped into a Taliban stronghold in a remote corner of Swat today, as the UN urged help for hundreds of thousands of people displaced by the fighting.        
	Helicopters flew soldiers into the Peochar valley, northwest off the main Swat valley where the Taliban have established headquarters, the military said. Their mission is to conduct search and destroy operations, military spokesman Major-General Athar Abbas said. The militants are on the run.

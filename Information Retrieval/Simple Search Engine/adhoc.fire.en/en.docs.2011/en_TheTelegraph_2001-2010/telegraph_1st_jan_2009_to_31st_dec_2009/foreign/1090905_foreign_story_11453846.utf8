	Kabul, Sept. 4: A Nato airstrike before dawn today killed 90 people or more, at least some of them civilians, in a once-calm region of northern Afghanistan that has recently slipped under control of insurgents, Afghan officials said.        
	Nato officials acknowledged that coalition aircraft had destroyed two hijacked fuel tankers in the tiny village of Omar Kheil, 24km south of Kunduz. The officials said they were investigating reports of civilian deaths, but stressed that the attack was aimed at Taliban militants.        
	German forces in northern Afghanistan under Nato command called in the attack, the German defence ministry said.         
	Afghan officials said the strike had killed insurgents as well as civilians who had surrounded the trucks and were siphoning fuel when the bombs struck. There were differing accounts of how many civilians were killed.        
	The airstrike comes three months after the lead Nato commander in Afghanistan, General Stanley A. McChrystal, tightened the rules governing the use of airstrikes here, in an effort to reduce the civilian deaths that he said were undermining the American-led mission by creating anger and opposition among Afghans. According to new rules of engagement, Nato airstrikes will in most cases be allowed only to prevent American and other coalition troops from being overrun by enemy fighters.         
	From initial accounts of todays airstrike from Nato and Afghan officials, it did not appear that this strike had met those conditions, regardless of whether the majority of the dead were Taliban or civilians.        
	A statement issued by the office of President Hamid Karzai said that he was deeply saddened and that he had sent a delegation to investigate, it added. The episode began late yesterday when a gang of Taliban guerrillas hijacked the two diesel trucks on the main highway south of Kunduz, Afghan and Nato officials said, and drove the trucks to Omar Kheil.         
	But when they came to a river, the trucks could not cross, so they told villagers to siphon off the diesel, and scores turned out.        
	The air attack exploded the tankers, and people close to the trucks were blown to bits. Some of those farther away died from severe burns, said the police chief of Kunduz province, General Razaq Yaqoobi.

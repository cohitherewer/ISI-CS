The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Leaked: UKs G20 crisis plan
                                                                                                               Leaked: UKs G20 crisis plan
  - Blueprint for spending 1.4 trillion revealed, finger at Germany        PATRICK HENNESSY                                  Brown, Merkel: Sabotage?                                      
	London, March 29: UK Prime Minister Gordon Browns preparations for this weeks G20 summit in London got off to a bad start last night when a British blueprint for a 1.4 trillion worldwide spending boost was leaked.         
	In an embarrassing disclosure, a draft of the final communique to be signed off by world leaders at the end of the one-day gathering on Thursday appeared in the German magazine Der Spiegel.         
	There were suspicions that the leak was a deliberate act of sabotage by sources within the German government, where Chancellor Angela Merkel is adopting a more cautious approach to fiscal moves to boost the national economy than Brown, who will chair the summit.         
	A Downing Street spokesperson said the leak was an old document with out-of-date figures and that the 1.4 trillion was an estimate by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) of stimulus measures already introduced by G20 countries. No new money was included, the spokesperson added.         
	The comments, though, only served to increase speculation that Brown was being forced to scale down ambitious plans because of international opposition, led by Germany and France.         
	Ahead of the summit, which will be held at the ExCel centre in Londons Docklands, Brown unveiled plans for a new crackdown on tax havens across the world.         
	David Owen, a former Labour foreign secretary, also warned that unless inflation was controlled, Britains economy might have to be constrained by the IMF.         
	David Camerons Conservative Party also widened its lead over Labour to 13 per cent in an ICM opinion poll for The Sunday Telegraph.         
	The leaked communique mentioned a figure of 1.4 trillion, signifying it was a proposal for spending by G20 nations by Britain, as summit host, that still had to be formally agreed.         
	According to the leak, this would boost growth by 2 per cent and employment by 19 million.         
	The draft also suggested that Britain wanted the G20 to come up with a target for global growth in 2010  although no figure was mentioned.         
	The document stated: We are determined to restore growth, resist protectionism and to reform our markets and institutions for the future.         
	We believe that an open world economy, based on the principles of the market, effective regulation and strong global institutions, can ensure sustainable globalisation with rising wellbeing for all.         
	Insiders at Der Spiegel said the magazine had obtained the leak from German government sources.         
	British officials, however, declined to blame Merkels inner circle directly, pointing the finger of blame instead at smaller political parties inside her ruling coalition.         
	A 10 Downing Street spokesperson said the 1.4 trillion figure did not amount to extra money which Britain was calling for governments to spend to try to rescue economies which have been crippled by the credit crunch, but referred instead to estimates of expenditure which had already been made.

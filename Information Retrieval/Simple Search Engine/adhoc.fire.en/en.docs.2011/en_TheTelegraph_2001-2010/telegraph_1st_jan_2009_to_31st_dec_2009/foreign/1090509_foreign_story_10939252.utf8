	All the main parties were today engaged in talks and strategy sessions but could not find a way out of the deadlock before tomorrows deadline set by President Ram Baran Yadav. The crisis was sparked by Maoist Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahals resignation after Yadav blocked his move to sack army chief General Rukmangat Katuwal.        
	Our Madhesi front will support any party that is prepared to form a national government, said Rajendra Mahato, president of the Sadbhavana Party. When asked what will be the Madhesi parties position if efforts to form a national unity government fails, he said: We will sit together, discuss the matter and try to find out our common stance.         
	The Madhesi Peoples Rights Forum has 53 seats in the Assembly, Terai Madhes Democratic Party has 21 seats and the Sadbhavana Party has 9 seats.        
	The combined strength of the Madhesis is 83 and they hold the key position in the 601-member Assembly. Maoists have 238 seats, Nepali Congress 113 seats and the CPN-UML 108.

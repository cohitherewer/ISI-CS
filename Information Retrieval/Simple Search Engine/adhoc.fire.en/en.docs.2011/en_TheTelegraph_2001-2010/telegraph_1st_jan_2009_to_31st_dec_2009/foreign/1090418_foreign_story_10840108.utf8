The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | 4 get jail in landmark Net piracy case
                                                                                                               4 get jail in landmark Net piracy case
                            
	Stockholm, April 17 (Reuters): Four men behind The Pirate Bay, one of the worlds biggest free file-sharing websites, were each sentenced to a year in jail today for breaching copyright, and ordered to pay $3.6 million in compensation.        
	Analysts said the guilty verdict in the closely-watched test case could help music and film companies recoup millions of dollars in lost revenues, though they doubted it would stem the tide of illegal downloading.        
	In a broadcast on The Pirate Bays website one of the four defendants, Peter Sunde, taunted the court, holding up a mock IOU note for 31 million Swedish crowns ($3.6 million) followed by the initialsJK  Internet lingo for just kidding. Thats the closest theyre going to get to getting money from me, Sunde said.        
	International trade body IFPI, which represents some 1,400 record companies across the world, reported earlier this year that about 95 per cent of music downloaded in 2008 was illegal. On its website, The Pirate Bay scorned the ruling, calling it a crazy verdict.        
	It was lol (laugh out loud) to read and hear, the message read. But as in all good movies, the heroes lose in the beginning but have an epic victory in the end anyhow.

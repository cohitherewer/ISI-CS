The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Symbol of US economic pride in ruins
                                                                                                               Symbol of US economic pride in ruins
                            
	The second and concluding part of K.P. Nayars drive along the trading route from the US to Canada where he came across the scars of the downturn.        
	Pontiac is in a shambles. Not the car. But the town that gave birth to the brand that was for many decades the flagship of Americas industrial prowess, the symbol of its ability to dominate the world of car making.        
	The town of Pontiac near Detroit struck an immediate chord in me when I first visited Michigan in 2000 after The Telegraph sent me to report on the US for the newspaper. I vividly remembered my grandfathers black Pontiac sedan which everyone in the small Kerala town of Cherthala recognised in the 1950s.        
	It was not until I went to Michigan that I found out that General Motors named their world famous brand after the town where GM acquired a local car company one century ago, converted and developed that plant into its production unit for Pontiac cars.        
	Eventually, the town of Pontiac would emerge as the headquarters of the Truck and Bus Division of General Motors and as the neighbour to the world headquarters of Chrysler Motors.        
	Disastrously for the town of Pontiac, the current US economic debacle has seen GM rapidly slide down the totem pole of the automobile industrys hierarchy  from being the worlds biggest automaker to a candidate for bankruptcy.        
	The towns prosperity has been linked to the well-being of GM for 100 years. And now both are in peril, a case study in how Americas industrial centres are being decimated by its grave economic crisis.        
	Every sixth person you come across today in Pontiac is unemployed, and given the age factor in the employment market, many of them have no hope of finding another job in the remainder of their lifetime even if Barack Obamas massive stimulus plan was to produce results.        
	Almost one third of Pontiacs residents have fallen below the poverty line, according to officials of the US Census Bureau. What is more difficult to digest is that almost half of all the children born in Pontiac are likely to live in poverty.        
	Pontiac is now a town at the crossroads, but it does not know where to go. What was Pontiacs emergency prescription last month to stave off bankruptcy? Save money by closing half of its schools.        
	In a way, it makes sense. Ignorant people are unlikely to think. And therefore, unlikely to revolt against authority and more likely to accept propaganda for truth.        
	The decision to close schools is also an alert to the grim choices that America now faces. For Pontiac, it was not an easy decision to take. The towns mayor, Clarence E. Phillips, has been a life-long champion of education.        
	For just under a quarter century, Phillips worked for the local school system. Lorene, his wife of 32 years, is also an educator. The black mayor, an alumnus of the Kennedy School of Government at Harvard, was elected in November last year at the same time Barack Obama was elected US President.        
	Now they both face the same challenge  one at the national level, another at the local level  of having to perform a magic resurrection from the depths of despair that their people simply cannot comprehend.        
	Cross the Ambassador Bridge that links the US and Canada on the Michigan-Ontario border and you enter Windsor, Canadas automobile capital, where the destruction wrought by the economic crisis is almost as severe.        
	On a previous visit to Windsor not very long ago, this city was exulting that Canadas outgoing Ambassador to the UN, Allan Rock, had spurned Ottawa, where he was born and raised, as well as Toronto, where he practised law for two decades, choosing Windsor, instead, to live and resume his law practice.        
	And Rock was not the only one to choose Windsor, a city that liked to compare itself to Detroit, just across Detroit River, and take pride in its lower crime rate, lack of a gun culture, swanky casinos drawing thousands of Americans on weekends and a largely contented middle class that tied its prosperity to automobile manufacture.        
	Howard Pawley, former premier of Manitoba province, also moved to Windsor, when he gave up politics to teach at the University of Windsor. So did Michael Bell, Canadas former Ambassador to Jordan, Egypt and Israel, who was most recently Chair of the Donor Committee of the International Reconstruction Fund Facility for Iraq.        
	Last week, the only shop in downtown Windsor, where I saw any significant business was a dollar store, where everything sells for a dollar. And the European Market, commonly known as the Polish Deli, where Windsors large East European communities like to buy their Hungarian salami, pork tongue and rabbit pate in preference to regular Canadian supermarkets which sell hormone-injected chicken and bland sausages that appeal to north American taste-buds.        
	But even along the shopping lanes at dollar stores, the only conversations were about who is going to be laid off next and when, about auto ancillary units which had run out of orders from Detroit and about friends and neighbours packing up and leaving Windsor because there was nothing to do there any more.        
	House vacancies have risen in Windsor to 20 per cent, according to those who dabble in its real estate. To Rent and For Sale boards are all over properties along many streets. I was shown a house with three levels, not very far from the high end river front, that has no takers even at Canadian $28,000. The Canadian dollar has fallen in recent months and is once again lower than its US counterpart.        
	But unlike in the US, there are not many foreclosures on properties in Canada because the country avoided the greed and recklessness of American banks. Be it on firearms or banking regulations, Canada is a country with far better laws than the US.But in the end, that may not be enough for cities like Windsor to survive if the US economy continues its downward spiral.

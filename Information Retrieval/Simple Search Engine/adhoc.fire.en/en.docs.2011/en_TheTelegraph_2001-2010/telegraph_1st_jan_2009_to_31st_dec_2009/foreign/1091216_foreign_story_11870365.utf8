                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      BA bid to halt strike
                            
	London, Dec. 15 (Reuters): British Airways is taking legal action to halt a 12-day strike planned by cabin crew over Christmas, alleging balloting irregularities.        
	The airline called on (union) Unite to call off the industrial action by 1400 GMT. The union has not done so and BA is now seeking an injunction to prevent the strike going ahead, the flag carriers chief executive Willie Walsh said today. BA cabin crew voted yesterday to walk out from December 22.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Oxford contender a sex pest
                                                                                                               Oxford contender a sex pest
                            
	London, May 10 (PTI): A dossier has accused Derek Walcott, a frontrunner for the post of professor of poetry at Oxford University, of being a sex pest.        
	The anonymous dossier, sent to Oxford academics a week before the election to the post for which Indian poet Arvind Mehrotra is a contender, recounts a sexual harassment claim against Walcott when he taught at Harvard University in the 1980s, The Sunday Times has reported.         
	The 79-year-old Nobel laureate was reprimanded following the allegation that he tried to pressure a female student into sleeping with him.         
	While Walcotts opponents have claimed it would disgrace the university to give such a coveted role  second only to the poet laureate  to a man with such a libidinous record, his supporters argue that past indiscretions should not be used to besmirch the reputation of the poet.

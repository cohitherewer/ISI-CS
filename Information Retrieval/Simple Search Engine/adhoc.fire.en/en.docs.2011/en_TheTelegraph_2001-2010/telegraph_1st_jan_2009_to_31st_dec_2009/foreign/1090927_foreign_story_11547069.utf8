	Washington, Sept. 26 (AP): After a week of meetings with world leaders, President Barack Obama is enjoying some family time.        
	Obama left the White House this morning for a soccer field in northwest Washington where his 11-year-old daughter Malia was playing soccer. First Lady Michelle Obama and the family dog, Bo, joined along.        
	The President stayed on the field sidelines with other onlookers and parents for about 30 minutes. As he left to return to the White House, several children shouted: Bye, Mr Obama. Obama waved to those on the field.        
	The US President returned to the White House yesterday after a week of meetings with world leaders at the UN General Assembly in New York and at an economic summit in Pittsburgh.        
	Malia and her sister Sasha attend the private Sidwell Friends School in Washington. It is the same institution where Chelsea Clinton, Tricia Nixon Cox and Archibald Roosevelt have studied. The grandchildren of Vice-President Joe Biden also study in the same school.        
	In Chicago, both sisters kept busy schedules with soccer, dance and drama for Malia, gymnastics and tap for Sasha and piano and tennis for both. Obama is scheduled to speak later at the Congressional Black Caucus Foundations annual dinner.

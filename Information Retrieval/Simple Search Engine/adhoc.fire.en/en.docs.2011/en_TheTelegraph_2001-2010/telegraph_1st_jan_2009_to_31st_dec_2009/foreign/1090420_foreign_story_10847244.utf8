The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Obama defends gesture

	Port of Spain, April 19 (AP): President Barack Obama today suggested Cuba release its political prisoners and strongly defended his highly publicised handshake with Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez at the end of an overseas trip that he said heralded a new start in US ties with Central America.        
	At a news conference marking the end of the Summit of the Americas, Obama added that in terms of Cuba and Venezuela, I do believe that the signals sent so far provide at least an opportunity for frank dialogue on a range of issues, including critical issues of democracy and human rights throughout the hemisphere.        
	And yet, he quickly added: The test for all of us is not simply words but also deeds.        
	Obama loosened aspects of a 50-year-old trade embargo with Cuba before departing Washington last Friday, and suggested ways Cuba could respond.        
	They could release political prisoners, he said, and reduce charges on remittances  the money that Cuban-Americans send their families in the communist nation.        
	The Presidents greeting of Venezuelas Chavez drew quick condemnation from Republicans back home, but Obama brushed that aside.        
	He said Venezuela had a defence budget about one-six hundredth the size of the USs, and owned Citgo, an oil company.        
	Its hard to believe we are endangering the strategic interests of the United States when he talks with Chavez, he said.        
	The trip was Obamas first presidential journey to the region, and he said the meeting of heads of state had the potential to create greater advancement of economic progress, climate control and immigration.        
	As he did on a recent trip to Europe, Obama stressed in Central America that the US was a willing partner, inclined to listen and not just talk, in trying to advance national interests.        
	We recognise that other countries have good ideas, too, and we want to hear them, he said, adding that the fact that an idea comes from a small country, like Costa Rica, should not diminish its potential benefit.        
	His trip was dominated by images of his handshake with Chavez, who once likened former President George W. Bush to the devil, as well as by at least an initial thaw in relations with the communist island-nation of Cuba.        
	Chavez approached secretary of state Hillary Clinton during the summit and said he was restoring his nations ambassador in Washington, voicing hopes for a new era in relations after exchanging greetings with Obama.

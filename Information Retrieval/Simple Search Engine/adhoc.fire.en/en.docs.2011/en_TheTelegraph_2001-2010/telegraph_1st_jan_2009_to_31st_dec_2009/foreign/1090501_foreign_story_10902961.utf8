The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Berlusconi wife wins row with husband
                                                                                                               Berlusconi wife wins row with husband
          NICK SQUIRES                          Veronica Lario                                  
	Rome, April 30: Silvio Berlusconis wife has been hailed the winner of a row over the Italian Prime Ministers eye for attractive young women, after his party backed down on plans to promote four starlets as candidates for the European Parliament.        
	Berlusconis governing coalition had initially considered putting forward the women, including television show hostesses and a former Big Brother contestant, as potential MEPs to represent Italy. But the plan was thrown into disarray when his wife, Veronica Lario, denounced the idea as shamelessly tacky in an email which she sent to Italys national news agency and which was then splashed across the countrys newspapers.         
	Berlusconis People of Freedom party has now decided to field just one of the candidates  Barbara Matera, 27, a glamorous blonde and former television showgirl.        
	Matera, from the southern region of Puglia, is a former Miss Italy contestant who has acted in films and on television. He had earlier blamed the row on Opposition politicians and hostile newspapers. Are all those gentlemen who mounted this campaign now going to shut up? he said.        
	The Italian press said the fact that only one of the four young women had been chosen to contest the elections in June was a victory for Berlusconis wife, who had compared the media tycoon to an emperor and said his patronage of pretty women was all about power.

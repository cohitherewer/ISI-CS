	Washington, July 13 (AP): A secret intelligence programme cancelled last month by CIA director Leon Panetta was meant to find and then capture or kill al Qaida leaders at close range rather than target them with air strikes that risked civilian casualties, government officials with knowledge of the operation said today.        
	 The officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorised to discuss the programme, said the spy agencys programme never got off the ground. Panetta cancelled the effort on June 23 after learning of its existence, its failure to yield results and that Congress had been unaware of the programme since its inception in 2001, according to an official.        
	That official said former President George W. Bush authorised killing al Qaida leaders shortly after the September 11, 2001, terror attacks, and Congress was made aware of that.         
	However, the official said, Panetta also told members of Congress that according to notes that he had been given on the early months of the program, former Vice-President Dick Cheney directed the CIA not to tell Congress specifics of the secret programme.        
	Panetta told the committees there was no indication of anything illegal or inappropriate about the effort itself, the official said. CIA directors since 2001 agreed with Cheneys decision not to inform Congress.

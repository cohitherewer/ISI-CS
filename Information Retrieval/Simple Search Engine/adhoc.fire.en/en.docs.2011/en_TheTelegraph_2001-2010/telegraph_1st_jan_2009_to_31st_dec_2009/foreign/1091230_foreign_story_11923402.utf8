The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Nokia launches new attack on Apple
                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      Nokia launches new attack on Apple
                                  
	Helsinki, Dec. 29 (Reuters): The worlds top mobile phone maker Nokia launched a new patent broadside against Apple, escalating a battle for control of the smartphone market that has already led to a flurry of lawsuits.        
	Nokia filed a complaint with the US International Trade Commission (ITC) today alleging that Apple infringes Nokia patents in virtually all of its mobile phones, portable music players, and computers sold.        
	The seven patents at issue relate to Nokia technology being used by Apple to create features in user interface, camera, antenna and power management technologies, it said in a statement.        
	A Nokia spokesman said the firm expected the ITC to decide whether to pursue the case in around 30 days. Any possible injunction against the sale of Apple products with regard to the alleged patent infringement would not happen until early 2011.        
	Apple was not immediately available for comment.        
	The ITC action is the latest step taken by Nokia to fight off fierce competition from Apple, with the inclusion of the US firms iconic iPod and iMac products in the complaint marking an escalation from previous patent claims.        
	Both firms had earlier this year launched patent infringement suits against the other.        
	Analysts say the dispute, potentially involving hundreds of millions of dollars in annual royalties, reflects the shifting balance of power in the mobile industry.

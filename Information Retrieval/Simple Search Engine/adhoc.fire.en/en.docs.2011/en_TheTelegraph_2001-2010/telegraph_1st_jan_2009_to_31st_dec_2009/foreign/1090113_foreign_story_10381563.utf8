	Virginity bids rise    
	 London, Jan. 12: A student who is auctioning her virginity to pay for a masters degree in family and marriage therapy has seen bidding hit 2.5million, reports The Daily Telegraph.       
	Natalie Dylan, 22, claims her offer of a one-night stand has persuaded 10,000 men to bid for sex with her. Last September, when her auction came to light, she had received bids up to 162,000 but since then interest in her has rocketed.       
	The student, who has a degree in Womens Studies, said she was persuaded to offer herself to the highest bidder after her sister Avia, 23, paid for her own degree after working as a prostitute for three weeks.      
	 She said she had had a lot of attention from a wide range of men, including wierdos, those who get really graphically sexual about what they want to do to me and lots of polite requests from rich businessmen.     
	Laugh burn    
	 London: Laughing intensely for an hour can burn as many calories as lifting weight for 30 minutes, scientists have found, reports The Daily Telegraph. Laughing out loud also makes the chest rise and fall, which in turn means that stomach muscles have to work harder.

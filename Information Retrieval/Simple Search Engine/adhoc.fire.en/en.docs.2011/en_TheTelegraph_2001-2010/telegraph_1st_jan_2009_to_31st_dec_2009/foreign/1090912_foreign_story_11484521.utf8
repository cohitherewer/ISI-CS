                              Baines                            
	Los Angeles, Sept. 11 (AP): Gertrude Baines, the worlds oldest known person who once quipped she had won the genetic lottery, died today at a nursing home. She was 115.        
	Baines may have suffered a heart attack, said her longtime physician Dr Charles Witt. I saw her two days ago, and she was just doing fine, Witt said. She was in excellent shape.

	London, Dec. 11: An online game that mocks Tiger Woodss car crash has become a Web hit.        
	The animated game, Tiger Woods Wife Outrun, challenges players to direct Tigers car while his wife Elin runs behind with a golf club. The objective is to score points by collecting golf club bags and trophies, and avoid crashing into rocks and fire hydrants. When the car finally crashes, Tiger is attacked by his wife.        
	The game follows on from the trend of ridiculing famous faces through Internet games. Animated game Sock and Awe, inviting players to throw shoes at George Bush, has had over 99 million plays.        
	Over 1.4 million people have played the Tiger Woods game so far. The game capitalises on the Internet frenzy surrounding Tiger Woods and the string of women with whom he is alleged to have had affairs.                            THE DAILY TELEGRAPH

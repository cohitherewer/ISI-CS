The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | UK likely to declare end of cheque book

          MYRA BUTTERWORTH                                    
	London, Dec. 16: Cheques are likely to be abolished following a vote to end the 350-year-old means of payment.        
	The Payments Council will decide whether to abolish the national cheque clearing system, a move which would effectively make all cheques redundant. The change would be phased in over several years and completed by 2018.        
	Despite growing reliance on debit cards, almost 4 million cheques are written every day in Britain. However, this is still two-thirds less than two decades ago, and numbers are expected to continue to decline, dropping to 1.6 million by 2018.         
	 The move is likely to anger many people, charities warned, particularly older people who tend to prefer cheques to plastic cards and who are less likely to use online banking to do electronic transfers.        
	Andrew Harrop, head of public policy at the charity Age Concern, said: Many older people rely on cheques as their main form of payment and will be very worried about how they will manage if they are withdrawn.        
	Without cheques, we are very concerned people will be forced to keep large amounts of cash in their home, leaving them vulnerable to theft and financial abuse. David Black, a banking specialist at finance website Defaqto, said: A lot of people still rely on cheques particularly those who dont use online banking.

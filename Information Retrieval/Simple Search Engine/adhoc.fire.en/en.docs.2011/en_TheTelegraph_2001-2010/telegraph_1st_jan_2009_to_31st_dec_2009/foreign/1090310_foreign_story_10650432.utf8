	Ninja kangaroo    
	 Canberra, March 9 (Reuters): An Australian couple thought they were being attacked by an intruder when a kangaroo crashed through their bedroom window and started jumping on them.      
	My initial thought, when I was half awake, was its a lunatic ninja coming through the window. It seems about as likely as a kangaroo breaking in, Beat Ettlin told local media today.      
	The three metre kangaroo smashed through the window in Ettlins Canberra home last night. While Ettlin and his wife and young daughter took refuge under the blankets, the injured kangaroo jumped on top of them, gouging holes in the furniture and smearing blood all over the walls, said the Australian Associated Press.      
	The next thing Ettlin heard was his 10-year-old son Leighton screaming from his bed: Theres a roo in my room!

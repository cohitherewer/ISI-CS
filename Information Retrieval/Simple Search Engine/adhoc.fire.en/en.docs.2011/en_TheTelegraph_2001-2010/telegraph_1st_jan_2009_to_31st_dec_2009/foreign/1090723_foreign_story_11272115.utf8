The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Court notice to Pervez on emergency
                                                                                                               Court notice to Pervez on emergency
          NASIR JAFFRY                               
	Islamabad, July 22: Pakistans Supreme Court on Wednesday summoned former military ruler retired General Pervez Musharraf to explain the circumstances that forces him to impose emergency rule and depose over 60 judges of the higher judiciary in 2007.         
	A 14-judge bench headed by chief justice Iftikhar Mohammad Chaudhry issued notice to Musharraf for July 29 during hearing of case regarding appointment of judges under         
	Provisional Constitutional Order (PCO) and imposition of emergency rule on November 3, 2007.         
	 quot;This is a very important case and justice cannot be done until the former president is given a chance to explain his position, quot; the chief justice said.         
	Musharraf, who became president for the second term in October 2007 while holding office of the army chief, imposed emergency rule and deposed 60 judges including Iftikhar Mohammad Chaudhry after he realized that the Supreme Court might overturn his victory as he was not eligible to contest the election in uniform.         
	 quot;The court issued notice to the former President since his November 3 action was being discussed, quot; attorney general Latif Khosa told reporters outside the Supreme Court building.         
	He said it would not be binding on Mr. Musharraf to personally appear before the court, adding that he may also hire services of a lawyer for the purpose.         
	Leading jurists termed issuance of notice to President Musharraf as an important development and said it would go a long way in ractifying wrongs of the past.         
	 quot;It is a very important decision to summon the former President, who is presently staying in London, quot; said Barrister Aitzaz Ahsan, who was Justice Chaudhrys main counsel in a case challenging his removal from office of the chief justice by Musharraf in March 2007.         
	He said the court would now ask the former President why did he violate the constitution by imposing emergency rule and deposing judges.         
	Musharraf had come under sharp criticism for sacking 60 judges after they had refused to take fresh oath of allegiance to him aunder the PCO.         
	Ahsan said Musharraf would not be handed down any punishment in this case but the court would not rule whether emegency and sacking of judges was legal or not.         
	Meanwhile, a senior government official said that the ruling Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) has no plans to protect Musharraf, who had ruled the country for over eight years with absolute authority and impunity.         
	The attorney-general had been asked not to defend Musharraf before the 14-member bench of the apex court.         
	Analysts say that Musharraf is left with two options: either to settle for an exiled life in the UK or to show courage of facing independent courts in Pakistan. Musharraf has recently purchased a flat in an expensive locality in London  Edgeware road.

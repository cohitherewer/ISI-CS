                                Assaf and Ilan Ramon                           
	Jerusalem, Sept. 13 (Reuters) The pilot son of Ilan Ramon, the Israeli astronaut who died along with Kalpana Chawla in the Columbia space shuttle disaster of 2003, was killed today when his fighter plane crashed during training, the Israeli military said.        
	Assaf Ramon, 20, had graduated from the air force flying school three months ago. There had been much local media interest in the career of the eldest son of the first  and only  Israeli in space. Broadcasters interrupted programmes today to bring the news of his death.        
	The single-seat F-16 piloted by the younger Ramon went down near the Palestinian city of Hebron in the West Bank.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Salahis pay debt with fake watch
                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      Salahis pay debt with fake watch
                            
	Washington, Dec. 11 (AP): A couple that crashed a White House party turned over a watch to pay a landscaping debt.         
	However, a jeweller said it was a fake luxury timepiece.        
	Tareq Salahi last week gave up his Patek Phillipe watch and his lawyer said it would be worth more than enough to pay a $2,000 debt to a landscaper. But a Pennsylvania watch expert said it was an imitation.         
	Ray Cosey, owner of R E Jewelers Watch amp; Clock in Chambersburg, Pennsylvania, said yesterday the watch might be worth $100. He said the watch could probably be bought on the street for less.        
	You can tell by looking at the back of the watch. Its see-through. I could tell by the grade of the movement that it isnt a genuine watch. You can buy them in New York for a little bit of nothing, Cosey, who has 36 years experience in the watch business, said.

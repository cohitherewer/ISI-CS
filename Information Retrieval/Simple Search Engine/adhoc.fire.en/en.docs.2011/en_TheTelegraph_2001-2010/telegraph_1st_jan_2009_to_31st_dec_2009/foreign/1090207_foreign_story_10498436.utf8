The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Nuke Khan freed, Hillary very concerned
                                                                                                               Nuke Khan freed, Hillary very concerned

	Islamabad, Feb. 6 (Reuters): A Pakistani court declared disgraced nuclear scientist Abdul Qadeer Khan free today, ending five years of house arrest for the man at the centre of the worlds most serious proliferation scandal.        
	In Washington, secretary of state Hillary Clinton said she was very much concerned about Khans release but declined additional comment. A US state department spokesman said the US had not confirmed the courts decision but if he is released, we think it would be extremely regrettable.        
	We believe A.Q. Khan remains a serious proliferation risk, state department spokesman Gordon Duguid told reporters.         
	Khan, lionised by many Pakistanis as the father of the countrys atomic bomb, confessed to selling nuclear secrets to Iran, North Korea and Libya in 2004, but was immediately pardoned by the government, although his movements were restricted to effective house arrest.        
	Its a matter of joy. The judgment, by the grace of Allah, is good, Khan told reporters outside his Islamabad house soon after news of the high court ruling broke.        
	It is because of this judgment that I am speaking to you, said the 72-year-old scientist, who has been treated for prostate cancer. Khans detention had been relaxed over the past year and he had been allowed to meet friends and had travelled to Karachi at least once under tight security.        
	He had also given a series of interviews to media after a new government came to power last March but was barred from speaking to reporters by a July court ruling.        
	Khans lawyer Ali Zafar said the high court had declared that he was not involved in nuclear proliferation or criminal activity and there was no case against him.        
	The court has ordered that hes a free man, Zafar said. Pakistan has never let foreign investigators question Khan, saying it had passed on all relevant information about his nuclear proliferation. The government had maintained that Khan was not officially under house arrest but was being held for his own security. It was not immediately clear to what extent security agencies would still restrict his movements. Pakistan regards the case as closed, but US nuclear experts still want to question him.         
	Sham detention        
	India today said that Khans release showed how Pakistan makde an apology of action against anybody who was guilty of a serious crime.         
	A.Q. Khan has committed a crime against humanity. He is a profilerator. And Pakistan had put him under house arrest  which proved to be a sham, sources said.

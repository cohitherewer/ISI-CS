  - Shooter faxes TV station: Why leave the children to a stranger?        SOPHIE TEDMANSON                          Ervin Antonio Lupoe (second from left) with his family. (AP)                                        
	London, Jan. 28: A medical technician killed his wife, five children and then himself yesterday after learning that he had been sacked from his job.         
	Ervin Antonio Lupoe faxed a letter to a local TV station in Los Angeles claiming that his wife had suggested they kill themselves and their children so as not to face poverty as a family.         
	According to the station, KABC-TV, Lupoe wrote: Why leave the children to a stranger? He then shot his wife Ana and their children  an eight-year-old girl, twin five-year-old girls and twin two-year-old boys  before turning the gun on himself at the family home in Wilmington.         
	The killings came a day after 70,000 people across the world, including 55,000 in the US, lost their jobs as a result of the global financial crisis.        
	Police urged people facing tough economic times not to take drastic action or resort to violence. Today our worst fear was realised, said Los Angeles deputy chief Kenneth Garner. Its just not a solution. Theres just so many ways you find alternatives to doing something so horrific and drastic as this.        
	The police would not release details of the faxed letter, however, the TV station reported that Lupoe had detailed workplace problems. He wrote that a medical centre administrator had rebuffed him and his wife, also an employee, when they arrived at work and said you should have blown your brains out.         
	After receiving the fax, the station called the police, around the same time that a man, believed to be Lupoe, phoned an emergency line and said: I just returned home and my whole familys been shot.         
	Officers could still smell the gunshot residue when they arrived at the Lupoe home to find the family dead and a revolver lying next to Ervins body. The police said despite Lupoes claim in the fax that his wife was somehow involved, he was the main suspect in the murder-suicide.         
	The police also said the couple had recently pulled the older children out of school, saying the family was moving to Kansas.         
	He was going through some critical situations at the job, thats what he described in that two-page letter, and thats what prompted him to take his own life and his familys, Garner said.         
	A spokesperson for the hospital group which runs the Kaiser Permanente West Los Angeles Medical Centre where the Lupoes worked confirmed that the couples jobs were recently terminated.                     THE TIMES, LONDON

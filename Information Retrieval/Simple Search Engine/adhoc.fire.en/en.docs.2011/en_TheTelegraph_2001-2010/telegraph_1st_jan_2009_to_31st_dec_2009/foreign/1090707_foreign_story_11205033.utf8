The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Robert McNamara dead
                                                                                                               Robert McNamara dead
                              Robert S. McNamara                            
	Washington, July 6 (AP): Robert S. McNamara, the cerebral secretary of defence who was vilified for prosecuting Americas most controversial war and then devoted himself to helping the worlds poorest nations, died today. He was 93.        
	McNamara died at 0930 GMT at his home, his wife Diana said. She added that he had been in failing health for some time.         
	For all his healing efforts, McNamara was fundamentally associated with the Vietnam War, McNamaras war, the countrys most disastrous foreign venture, the only American war to end in abject withdrawal rather than victory.        
	Known as a policymaker with a fixation for statistical analysis, McNamara was recruited to run the Pentagon by President John F. Kennedy in 1961 from the presidency of the Ford Motor Co. He stayed seven years, longer than anyone since the jobs creation in 1947.        
	His association with Vietnam became intensely personal. Even his son, as a Stanford University student, protested against the war while his father was running it. At Harvard, McNamara once had to flee a student mob through underground utility tunnels. Critics mocked McNamara mercilessly; they made much of the fact that his middle name was Strange.        
	After leaving the Pentagon on the verge of a nervous breakdown, McNamara became president of the World Bank and devoted evangelical energies to the belief that improving life in rural communities in developing countries was a more promising path to peace than the buildup of arms and armies.        
	A private person, McNamara for many years declined to write his memoirs, to lay out his view of the war and his side in his quarrels with his generals. In the early 1990s he began to open up.         
	He told Time magazine in 1991 that he did not think the bombing of North Vietnam  the biggest bombing campaign in history up to that time  would work but he went along with it because we had to try to prove it would not work, number one, and (because) other people thought it would work.         
	Finally, in 1993, after the Cold War ended, he undertook to write his memoirs because some of the lessons of Vietnam were applicable to the post-Cold War period odd as though it may seem.        
	In Retrospect: The Tragedy and Lessons of Vietnam appeared in 1995. McNamara disclosed that by 1967 he had deep misgivings about Vietnam  by then he had lost faith in Americas capacity to prevail over a guerrilla insurgency.        
	From 1943 to 1945, McNamara travelled to several Asian countries. He later said that it was the experience of visiting Calcutta during a famine, where there were as many dead people in the streets as live ones, that first stirred his interest in trying to improve conditions in the poorest nations.              
	 Despite those doubts, he had continued to express public        
	confidence that the application of enough American firepower would        
	cause the Communists to make peace. In that period, the number of        
	U.S. casualties - dead, missing and wounded - went from 7,466 to        
	over 100,000.        
	 quot;We of the Kennedy and Johnson administrations acted according        
	to what we thought were the principles and traditions of our        
	country. But we were wrong. We were terribly wrong, quot; McNamara, then        
	78, told The Associated Press in an interview ahead of the books        
	release.        
	 The best-selling mea culpa renewed the national debate about the        
	war and prompted bitter criticism against its author.        
	 quot;Where was he when we needed him? quot; a Boston Globe editorial        
	asked. A New York Times editorial referred to McNamara as offering        
	the wars dead only a quot;prime-time apology and stale tears, three        
	decades late. quot;        
	 McNamara wrote that he and others had not asked the five most        
	basic questions: Was it true that the fall of South Vietnam would        
	trigger the fall of all Southeast Asia? Would that constitute a        
	grave threat to the Wests security? What kind of war - conventional        
	or guerrilla - might develop? Could we win it with U.S. troops        
	fighting alongside the South Vietnamese? Should we not know the        
	answers to all these questions before deciding whether to commit        
	troops?        
	 He discussed similar themes in the 2003 documentary quot;The Fog of        
	War: Eleven Lessons from the Life of Robert S. McNamara. quot; With the        
	U.S. in the first year of the war in Iraq, it became a popular and        
	timely art-house attraction and won the Oscar for best documentary        
	feature.        
	 The Iraq war, with its similarities to Vietnam, at times brought        
	up McNamaras name, in many cases in comparison with another        
	unpopular defense secretary, Donald H. Rumsfeld. McNamara was among        
	former secretaries of defense and state who met twice with President        
	George W. Bush in 2006 to discuss Iraq war policies.        
	 In the Kennedy administration, McNamara was a key figure in both        
	the disastrous Bay of Pigs invasion of April 1961 and the Cuban        
	missile crisis 18 months later. The crisis was the closest the world        
	came to a nuclear confrontation between the Soviet Union and the        
	United States.        
	 McNamara served as the World Bank president for 12 years. He        
	tripled its loans to developing countries and changed its emphasis        
	from grandiose industrial projects to rural development.        
	 After retiring in 1981, he championed the causes of nuclear        
	disarmament and aid by the richest nation for the worlds poorest.        
	He became a global elder statesman.        
	 McNamaras trademarks were his rimless glasses and slicked down        
	hair and his reliance on quantitative analysis to reach conclusions,        
	calmly promulgated in a husky voice.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Senators agree on US stimulus plan
                                                                                                               Senators agree on US stimulus plan

	Washington, Feb. 7: Senate Democrats reached an agreement with Republican moderates yesterday to pare a huge economic recovery measure, clearing the way for approval of a package that President Obama said was urgently needed in light of mounting job losses.        
	The deal, announced on the Senate floor, was a result of two days of tense negotiations and political theatre. Obama dispatched his chief of staff to Capitol Hill to help conclude the talks and reassure senators in his own party, and he called three key Republicans to applaud them for their patriotism. Earlier, when it looked as if a vote might take place last night, officials said, a government plane was dispatched to Florida to bring back Senator Edward M. Kennedy, a Massachusetts Democrat who has brain cancer.         
	The fine print was not immediately available, and the numbers were shifting. But in essence, the Democratic leadership and two centrist Republicans announced they had struck a deal on about $110 billion in cuts to the roughly $900 billion legislation  a deal expected to provide at least the 60 votes needed to send the bill out of the Senate and into negotiations with the House.        
	The pact, which is expected to be approved in the next few days, was concluded just hours after the labour department announced that 598,000 jobs were lost in January. The contraction in jobs is already steeper than in any other recession.         
	As the negotiations were under way, lawmakers said it was time to stop quibbling about the exact parameters of the legislation  which mixes safety-net spending, tax cuts and a huge infusion of dollars into federal programmes  and to begin work towards a final agreement that could be sent to Obama next week.        
	The details were negotiated at an afternoon meeting in the office of the Senate majority leader, Harry Reid of Nevada, involving Reid, other top Democrats and two Republicans, Susan Collins of Maine and Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania. After they came to terms, the senators brought in the White House chief of staff, Rahm Emanuel, for assurance that the deal was acceptable to the administration. Emanuel signalled it was.

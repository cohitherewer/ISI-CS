The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Palin back in news, sister-in-law held

          K.P. NAYAR                                   Sarah and Diana Palin. (AP)                                
	Washington, April 4: Alaskas photogenic governor Sarah Palin, who briefly electrified the 2008 US presidential election with her failed vice- presidential bid, is once again providing relief for an America depressed by gun violence, economic catastrophe and other severe problems.         
	The Palins grabbed the headlines yesterday with the arrest of the governors sister-in-law, Diana Palin, for allegedly burglarising a house, probably for the second or third time in a week.         
	They will continue to provide diversion for Americans on Monday, when Levi Johnston, who fathered the child of the governors daughter, Bristol, tells supermodel Tyra Banks on her award winning TV talk show that the arch conservative Sarah knew that her daughter and Johnston were having sex although Bristol was only a teenager when she became pregnant.         
	Diana Palin, who was produced in a court in Wasilla and given a court-appointed, state-funded public defender, is the half-sister of Todd Palin, the governors controversial husband, who has been accused of being an extra-constitutional authority in Alaska and a meddler in his wifes affairs of state. The governors 35 year-old sister-in-law, now facing felony burglary, misdemeanour theft and criminal trespass charges, was caught red-handed in the Wasilla home of Theodore Turcott on Thursday.         
	According to Wasilla police deputy chief Greg Wood, Turcott told authorities that on the day of the burglary, he saw a Toyota sedan coming into his driveway and that he did not recognise the woman alighting from the car.         
	According to an affidavit filed in court when Diana Palin was produced before the judge, Turcott had been burglarised twice. So he quickly got hold of his gun and hid in a bathroom to see what the woman was up to.         
	Turcott told the police that on March 26, his house was burglarised and $2,200 was taken and again on March 31 another $391 was stolen.         
	Diana Palin obviously knew where the money was kept in the house because she headed straight for a shelf in the bedroom and proceeded to help herself with more cash, when the houseowner confronted her at gunpoint and held her until the police came and arrested her.         
	Alaska is the sort of place where people leave their doors unlocked and crime is low. She has now been charged for the trespasses last month as well. The accused had brought her four year-old daughter along for the alleged burglaries.         
	The daughter told the police that she and her mother had been to the house before. But Diana Palin denied this and insisted that she had mistaken the Turcott residence for her friends house.         
	Police, however, said photographs taken by Turcott for evidence after the two earlier burglaries appeared to match the tyre tracks of Diana Palins car and her footprints.         
	Police called her husband, Scott McLean, after the arrest to go and pick up their daughter from safe police custody and take her home. Diana Palins driving licence had already been suspended for a series of traffic offences and for operating a vehicle with an expired registration.         
	Also appearing on Mondays Tyra Banks Show will be Johnstons mother and sister, who will reveal that they were under a gag order from the Republican presidential campaign during the entire White House race, according to pre-show publicity material.         
	Johnston and the governors daughter have split up recently although they had announced their intention to marry after news of Bristols teenage pregnancy hit the presidential campaign like a bombshell. Johnston says in the interview that Bristol allows him to visit their infant son but will not allow him to take the baby out.         
	The governors spokeswoman said in a statement yesterday about the upcoming show that we are disappointed that Levi and his family, in a quest for fame, attention and fortune, are engaging in flat-out lies, gross exaggeration, and even distortion of their relationship.

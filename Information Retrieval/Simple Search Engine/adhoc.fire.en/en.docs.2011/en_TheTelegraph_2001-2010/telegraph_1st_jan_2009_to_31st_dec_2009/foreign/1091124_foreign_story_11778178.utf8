The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Burqa Barbie sparks controversy
                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      Burqa Barbie sparks controversy
          AMIT ROY                              
	London, Nov. 23: Barbie, the American doll, is embroiled in a fresh controversy after its US manufacturers, Mattel, gave their blessings to an auction in which several of the popular childrens toys are dressed in burkhas.        
	While supporters say there is nothing exceptional about Muslim women wearing Islamic apparel, critics contend such dolls encourage a servile attitude in girls at an impressionable age.        
	This latest row follows that at Cambridge University where the authorities have confirmed that female Muslim students will be allowed to appear at graduation ceremonies with burkhas under their mortar boards  should they wish to do so.        
	The auction of 500 dolls, including those in burkhas as well as ones in a sari and in a Japanese kimono, was due to take place at the Salone dei Cinquecento, in Florence, Italy, on behalf of the well known childrens charity, Save the Children. It was being conducted by Sothebys.        
	 Will Burkha Barbie be allowed out of the toy box without a chaperone if action man is in the room? asked one woman on a newspaper website. Is she only allowed to remove her veil when all the boys have gone for tea?        
	 There was a rejoinder: I think this is really important for girls, wherever they are from, they should have the opportunity to play with a Barbie that they feel represents them.        
	 Barbie, which is celebrating its 50th birthday, began with the classic all American, blue eyed, blonde look but has diversified its range over the decades to appeal to children and their parents of all races, colours and ethnicities from countries across the globe.        
	First launched in March 1959 by an enterprising American businesswoman Ruth Handler (1916-2002), who had watched her daughters role playing with dolls, Barbies marketing strategy has been quite shrewd. It is estimated that over a billion Barbie dolls have been sold in over 150 countries, with Mattel claiming that three of its dolls fly off the counter every second.        
	A persistent criticism of Barbie has been that it promotes an idealistic idea of body image, which could encourage young girls to refuse food and become anorexic.        
	 In July 1992 Mattel released Teen Talk Barbie, which spoke a number of phrases including Will we ever have enough clothes?, I love shopping!, and Wanna have a pizza party?        
	 There has even been Barbies in saris in the past, and there are plans to introduce new versions, inspired by either Katrina Kaif or Aishwarya Rai.        
	The auction has been backed by Mattel, with the dolls being dressed by Italian designer Eliana Lorena.        
	 Rosie Shannon, from Save the Children, said: We are delighted Sothebys and the designer chose to auction the burkha Barbie dolls for our charity.        
	She added all the money would go towards the Rewrite the Future campaign which helps millions of children around the world traumatised by conflict.        
	One of Britains biggest collectors, Angela Ellis, 35, from Cheshire, who has more than 250 Barbies, blessed the burkha: Bring it on, Burkha Barbie, I think this is a great idea. I know Barbie was something seen as bad before as an image for girls, but in actual fact the message with Barbie for women is you can be whatever you want to be. I have a Barbie in a wheelchair that was only out for only six weeks.

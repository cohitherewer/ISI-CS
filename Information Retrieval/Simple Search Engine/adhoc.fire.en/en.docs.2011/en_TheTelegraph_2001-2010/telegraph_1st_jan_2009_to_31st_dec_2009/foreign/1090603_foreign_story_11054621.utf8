	Islamabad, June 2 (Reuters): Pakistani soldiers today rescued scores of students and staff of a military-run college who were abducted by Taliban militants in the northwest of the country, a military spokesperson said.        
	The abduction took place yesterday as the Pakistani army pressed on with an offensive against the Taliban in the Swat Valley.        
	Military spokesperson Major-General Athar Abbas said the Taliban were taking the kidnapped students to South Waziristan, a militant stronghold on the Afghan border, when soldiers challenged them on a road. Under cover of the firing the militants escaped and we have recovered them all, Abbas said. Seventy-one students and nine members of staff had been rescued.        
	College principal Javed Iqbal Piracha, among those rescued, said 10 to 15 students appeared to be still missing.         
	Taliban fighters seized the students convoy near the Afghan border in North Waziristan.

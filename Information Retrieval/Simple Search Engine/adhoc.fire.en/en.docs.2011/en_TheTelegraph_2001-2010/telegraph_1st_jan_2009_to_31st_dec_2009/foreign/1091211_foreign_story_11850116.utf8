                              not interested                            
	London, Dec. 10 (PTI): Dirty Harry is no longer interested in acting.         
	Veteran actor Clint Eastwood says he is done with acting and wants to spend rest of his life behind the camera.         
	However, the 79-year-old actor-director is ready to come out of retirement if he finds a script that he can not refuse.        
	The multiple-Oscar-winning star has announced that 2008 film Gran Torino will be his final film as a leading man, reports the Daily Express.        
	Im done... You never know where a good story comes from but Im a senior here (and) you get to a certain stage and you think: Why not just stand behind the camera?, Eastwood said on a chat show. Nobodys fooling with you, nobodys wanting to put make-up, do you collar, all that kind of stuff, the actor said.

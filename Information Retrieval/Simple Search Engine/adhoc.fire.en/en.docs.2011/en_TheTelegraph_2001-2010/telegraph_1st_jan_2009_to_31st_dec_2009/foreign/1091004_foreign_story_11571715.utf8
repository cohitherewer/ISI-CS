The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Kayani and Sharif kin in secret meet
                                                                                                               Kayani and Sharif kin in secret meet
                              Kayani                           
	Islamabad, Oct. 3 (PTI): Pakistan Army chief General Ashfaq Parvez Kayani has held a secret meeting with senior Pakistan Muslim League (Nawaz) leader and Punjab chief minister Shahbaz Sharif this week, according to a media report, sparking speculation in political circles, .         
	The meeting between the powerful army chief and the brother of former Premier Nawaz Sharif took place after midnight on Wednesday. Shahbaz visited Kayanis residence in Rawalpindi without security and protocol.         
	Only two vehicles were present at the Rawalpindi airport and no prominent official was present to receive Shahbaz, the Dawn News channel quoted its sources as saying.        
	After a brief halt at Punjab House in Rawalpindi, Shahbaz drove with Chaudhry Nisar Ali Khan, the leader of Opposition in the National Assembly, to Army House, Kayanis official residence.         
	There has been no official word on the meeting.         
	In the general election last year, Kayani had barred military officers from meeting politicians. However, the army chief had met Pakistan Peoples Party leader Aitzaz Ahsan, a key player in the lawyers movement.        
	It is believed that Kayani used the meeting with Ahsan to send a message to lawyers and the judiciary protesting the sacking of judges by Pervez Musharraf that the army did not favour any move to put the former President on trial.         
	There has been speculation that Kayanis meeting with Shahbaz could have focussed on the same issue.         
	The PML-N has been pressing for Musharrafs trial on charges of treason after the supreme court declared the that the Emergency imposed by him in 2007 was illegal and unconstitutional.        
	Both PML-N spokesperson Ahsan Iqbal and chief army spokesperson Athar Abbas said they had no knowledge of the meeting.        
	Taliban offensive        
	Pakistans military is plannig a full-fledged offensive against the Taliban in the militants stronghold in the tribal belt close to the Afghan border.        
	This is the right time for a full-fledged operation against the Taliban to wipe them out from Waziristan and break their back in their last strong-hold, an intelligence official told The Daily Telegraph.

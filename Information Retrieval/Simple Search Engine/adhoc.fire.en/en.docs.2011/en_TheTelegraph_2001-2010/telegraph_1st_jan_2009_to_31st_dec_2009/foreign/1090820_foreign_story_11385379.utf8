	Keira brushed    
	 London, Aug. 19: Keira Knightley appears to have been given the airbrush treatment once again in a Chanel advertisement which gives her a bigger bust, reports The Daily Telegraph.      
	The slim British actress looks to have increased several cup sizes in the latest campaign for Coco Mademoiselle perfume. In 2004, an image of Knightley was digitally enhanced for the US posters advertising her film, King Arthur.       
	For the Pirates of the Caribbean movies, make-up artists took a more old-fashioned approach by painting in a cleavage to give the impression that she was spilling out of her corsets.  
	Penn split    
	 Los Angeles (PTI): After two false alarms, it looks like Hollywood couple Sean Penn and Robin Wright Penn are finally going to part ways, with the actress having filed for divorce. The divorce papers states that the reason for the split was irreconcilable differences.

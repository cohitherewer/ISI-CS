The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Army kills 100 Tigers in 2 days
                                                                                                               Army kills 100 Tigers in 2 days
                            
	Colombo, March 8 (AP): Fierce fighting between Sri Lankan troops and Tamil Tigers defending their last remaining enclave has left about 100 rebels dead in two days of battle, the military said today.        
	The army has ousted the LTTE from most of their strongholds in an all-out offensive the government hopes will end the islands 25-year civil war.        
	The rebel holdouts are confined to about 50sqkm of jungle and beach near Mullaittivu on the northeastern coast along with tens of thousands of increasingly distressed civilians.        
	Military spokesperson Udaya Nanayakkara said today troops had killed about 100 rebels in a series of clashes in rebel-held territory since Friday, though he cautioned that only about 50 bodies were found.        
	Troops also took casualties in three battles on the edge of the enclave, the armys website said. Nanayakkara would not say how many soldiers were killed or wounded.        
	In one clash, more than 200 rebel fighters attacked security forces near Puthkkudiyirippu, the last rebel-held town, before dawn on Friday, the defence ministry said.        
	Terrorist offensive waves were received with intense military counter attacks that killed at least 30 guerrillas, the ministry said in a statement.        
	Rebel officials could not be reached.        
	Concern is mounting for the fate of the civilians caught in the fighting.        
	The government has rejected calls from international aid groups for a cease-fire, saying it is on the verge of victory, while the rebels have ruled out any mass evacuation of civilians  fuelling suspicion they are using them as human shields.        
	The UN says thousands of innocents have been killed or wounded in recent fighting and the survivors are dangerously short of food, drinking water, medical supplies and shelter.

                              Palin in New York. (AP)                            
	New York, Nov. 14 (AP): Sarah Palin says she did not know her daughter Bristol was sexually active before she learned the teenager was pregnant.        
	The former vice-presidential candidate told ABC televisions Barbara Walters: Truthfully, we were devastated.        
	Bristol was a high school senior when she gave birth to son Tripp in December. Her pregnancy was publicly announced just after Sarah Palin accepted John McCains invitation to be his running mate.         
	ABC released that exchange between Walters and Palin today. Portions of their interview will begin airing on Good Morning America and will be shown at length on the news magazine 20/20.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Hugging is the new hello
                                                                                                               Hugging is the new hello
          SARAH KERSHAW                          Essential embrace                                  
	Washington, May 28: There is so much hugging at Pascack Hills High School in Montvale, New Jersey, that students have broken down the hugs by type.         
	There is the basic friend hug, probably the most popular, and the bear hug, of course. But now there is also the bear claw, when a boy embraces a girl awkwardly with his elbows poking out.        
	There is the hug that starts with a high-five, then moves into a fist bump, followed by a slap on the back and an embrace.        
	Theres the shake and lean; the hug from behind; and, the newest addition, the triple  any combination of three girls and boys hugging at once. Were not afraid, we just get in and hug, said Danny Schneider, a junior at the school, where hallway hugging began shortly after 7am on a recent morning as students arrived. We dont care. You just get right in there and jump in.        
	There are romantic hugs, too, but that is not what these teenagers are talking about.        
	Girls embracing girls, girls embracing boys, boys embracing each other  the hug has become the favourite social greeting when teenagers meet or part these days. Teachers joke about one hour and six hour hugs, saying that students hug one another all day as if they were separated for the entire summer.         
	A measure of how rapidly the ritual is spreading is that some students complain of peer pressure to hug to fit in. And schools from Hillsdale, New Jersey, to Bend, Oregon, wary in a litigious era about sexual harassment or improper touching  or citing hallway clogging and late arrivals to class  have banned hugging or imposed a three-second rule.         
	Parents, who grew up in a generation more likely to use the handshake, the low-five or the high-five, are often baffled by the close physical contact. Its a wordless custom, from what Ive observed, wrote Beth J. Harpaz, the mother of two boys, 11 and 16, and a parenting columnist for The Associated Press.        
	And there doesnt seem to be any other overt way in which they acknowledge knowing each other, she continued, describing the scene at her older sons school in Manhattan. No hi, no smile, no wave, no high-five  just the hug. Witnessing this interaction always makes me feel like I am a tourist in a country where I do not know the customs and cannot speak the language.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | North Korea in attack threat
                                                                                                               North Korea in attack threat

	Seoul, May 27: North Korea threatened today to launch military strikes against South Korea if any of its ships were stopped or searched as part of an American-led operation to intercept vessels suspected of carrying weapons of mass destruction.        
	Adding to tension in the region, South Korean media reported that Pyongyang had restarted a plant that makes plutonium that can be used in nuclear bombs.        
	South Korea agreed to join the global interdiction programme after North Korea tested a nuclear device on Monday  its second nuclear test in three years. The North had earlier warned the South not to participate in the effort, known as the Proliferation Security Initiative. We consider this a declaration of war against us, an unidentified North Korean military spokesman said today in a statement carried by the Norths official news agency, KCNA. Any hostile act against our peaceful vessels, including search and seizure, will be considered an unpardonable infringement on our sovereignty and we will immediately respond with a powerful military strike.        
	The North Koreans also said in the statement that they no longer feel bound by the armistice that ended the fighting in the 1950-53 Korean War. Technically, the two Koreas have remained at war for more than 50 years, because the 1953 armistice never gave way to a final peace treaty. North Korea has previously called the armistice a useless piece of paper.        
	The Norths strident rhetoric is not unusual in statements released to the outside world, but the latest broadsides are likely to worsen tensions created by Mondays nuclear test.

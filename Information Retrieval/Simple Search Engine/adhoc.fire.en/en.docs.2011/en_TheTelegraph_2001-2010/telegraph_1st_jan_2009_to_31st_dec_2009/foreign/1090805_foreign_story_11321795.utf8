The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Clinton, Kim meet over scribes
                                                                                                               Clinton, Kim meet over scribes
          CHOE SANG-HUN, MARK LANDLER AND PETER BAKER                          Bill Clinton and Kim Jong-il in Pyongyang. (AP)                                  
	Seoul, Aug. 4: Former President Bill Clinton today met Kim Jong-il, the reclusive and ailing leader of North Korea, while on a visit to negotiate the release of two imprisoned American television journalists, North Korean state media reported.         
	The high-level meeting, along with welcoming gestures from the regime, added to speculation among analysts in Seoul that North Korea, after months of raising tensions and hostile rhetoric towards Washington, may be ready to return to dialogue with Washington.        
	That notion was reinforced by North Koreas Central TV, which reported that Kim and Clinton exchanged a broad range of opinions on issues of mutual interest.        
	 Tensions have been high since a nuclear test by the north on May 25 and the subsequent American-led effort to impose international sanctions against the reclusive nation.         
	However, administration officials sought to temper suggestions that Clinton would engage in sweeping discussions with Kim about North Koreas nuclear programme. His brief, one official said, was strictly limited to the imprisoned journalists.         
	Accompanying Clinton was John Podesta, who was his last chief of staff at the White House and is now an informal adviser to the Obama administration. Podesta, the president of the Center for American Progress, a research organisation in Washington, is an influential player in Democratic policy circles.         
	Clinton also brought longtime personal aides, including Douglas Band. Kang Sok-ju, the first vice- foreign minister and Kims most trusted adviser on Pyongyangs relations with Washington, attended the meeting.         
	Later in the evening, the norths National Defence Commission, the countrys top governing agency chaired by Kim, hosted a dinner party for Clinton, state media reported.        
	The former President flew into Pyongyang in an unmarked jet early this morning local time, Central TV, a North Korean station, reported. The White House confirmed the visit today, but said it was a private mission.         
	While this solely private mission to secure the release of two Americans is on the ground, we will have no comment, Gibbs said. We do not want to jeopardise the success of former President Clintons mission.         
	The imprisoned journalists, Laura Ling, 32, and Euna Lee, 36, were detained by soldiers on March 17 near the North Korean border with China. In June, they were sentenced to 12 years in a North Korean prison camp.

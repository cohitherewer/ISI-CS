The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Obama pushes China on rights
                                                                              Tuesday , November 17 , 2009                                                                                                                                                                                            Obama pushes China on rights
          HELENE COOPER AND DAVID BARBOZA                          Obama greets students at the meeting in Shanghai. (AP)                                  
	Shanghai, Nov. 16: President Obama didnt explicitly call on Chinas leaders to lift the veil of state control that restricts Internet access and online social networking here.         
	But Obama did tiptoe  ever so lightly  into that controversial topic today when he told students in Shanghai that a free and unfettered Internet is a source of strength, not weakness.        
	For Obama, who has been taking pains to strike a conciliatory note during his first visit to China, it was a rare challenge to Chinese authorities, but expressed in Obamas now familiar nuance. Responding to a question that came via the Internet during a town hall meeting with Shanghai students  Should we be able to use Twitter freely?  Obama first started to answer in the slightly off-the-point manner.        
	Well, first of all, let me say that I have never used Twitter, he said. My thumbs are too clumsy to type in things on the phone.         
	But then he appeared to gather confidence. I should be honest, as President of the United States, there are times where I wish information didnt flow so freely because then I wouldnt have to listen to people criticising me all the time, he said. But, he added: Because in the United States, information is free, and I have a lot of critics in the United States who can say all kinds of things about me, I actually think that that makes our democracy stronger and it makes me a better leader because it forces me to hear opinions that I dont want to hear.        
	On a trip where he has gone out of his way to present a kinder and gentler image of America  bowing before Emperor Akihito in Japan (which raised the ire of Right-wing bloggers back home), meeting one of the military rulers of Myanmar, reassuring China that America doesnt seek to contain the rising economic giant  the Twitter question, and Obamas answer, stood out as a stark snapshot of a young American Presidents efforts to reach Chinas youth while not offending its authorities. I will no forget this morning, one Chinese Twitterer said. I heard, on my shaky Internet connection, a question about our own freedom which only a foreign leader can discuss.         
	Interestingly, Chinas government itself demonstrated some restraint, and allowed the Twitter question and Obamas answer to stay up on websites hours after the town hall meeting.        
	That restraint, however, apparently only went so far. The students some 500 in the audience seemed handpicked by the government and many were members of the Communist Youth League, which is closely affiliated with President Hu Jintao.

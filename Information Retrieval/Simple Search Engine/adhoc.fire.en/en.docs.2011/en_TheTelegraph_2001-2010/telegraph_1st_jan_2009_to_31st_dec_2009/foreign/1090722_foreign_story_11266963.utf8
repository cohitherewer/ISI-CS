The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Iran police clash with protesters
                                                                                                               Iran police clash with protesters
  - Dozens detained, says witness                            Ahmadinejad: More unrest                                  
	Tehran, July 21 (Reuters): Iranian riot police clashed with hundreds of pro-reform protesters in central Tehran today and detained dozens of them, a witness said, in the latest unrest over last months disputed election.        
	The witness said demonstrators were chanting slogans against President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad and the government, including: Ahmadinejad  resign, resign and Death to dictators.        
	The witness said police beat protesters who had gathered in Tehrans Haft-e Tir square in defiance of a ban on such demonstrations following the June 12 election, which the Opposition says was rigged in favour of Ahmadinejad.        
	Riot police are taking dozens of protesters into their cars and they are taking them away, the witness said.        
	There are hundreds of riot police and plainclothes (security forces), beating people who gathered to support (Opposition leader Mir Hossein) Mousavi, the witness said.        
	The clash erupted four days after similar confrontations between police and protesters for the first time in weeks on Friday after former President Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani declared the Islamic Republic in crisis and said there were doubts about the election result.        
	The authorities reject Opposition charges of vote rigging. The election stirred the most striking display of internal unrest in Iran, the worlds fifth biggest oil exporter, since the 1979 revolution and exposed deep rifts in its ruling elite.        
	At least 20 people died in post-election violence last month. Mousavi and the authorities blame each other for the bloodshed. Riot police and religious Basij militia eventually suppressed Junes protests, but Mousavi has remained defiant.        
	Ahmadinejad deputy        
	Irans top authority wants Ahmadinejad to dismiss a senior official who has said Iran was friends with everyone, even the people of arch-foe Israel, a senior MP said today.        
	Ahmadinejad has come under fire from fellow conservatives and hardliners for appointing Esfandiar Rahim Mashaie as his first vice-president. However, Ahmadinejad refused to back down on Mashaies appointment.

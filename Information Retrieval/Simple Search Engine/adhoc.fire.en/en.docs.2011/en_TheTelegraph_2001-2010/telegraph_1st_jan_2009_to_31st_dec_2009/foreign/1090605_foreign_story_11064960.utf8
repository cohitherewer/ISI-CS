The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | In India, praise amp; wait

          CITHARA PAUL                          Obama during his speech. (AFP)                                  
	New Delhi, June 4: Muslim leaders in Delhi agree that Barack Obamas reconciliatory speech to the community today was a good beginning, but some want to wait till they see some actual change in US policy.        
	Speaking in Cairo, the US President called for a new beginning in relations between his country and the Muslim world, based on mutual interest and respect.        
	Among the most elated was Kamal Farooqi, member of the All India Muslim Personal Law Board, who said Obamas speech had changed the world order for ever.        
	I am very much excited after hearing Obama. I feel Obama is a person who means what he says. It is a new beginning and also a historic moment not just for Muslims but for the entire world, he said.        
	Zafarul Islam Khan of the Milli Council, an all-India body of scholars and academics, agreed. He said Obama had provided a welcome change from George W. Bushs anti-Islam policies, which had driven a wedge between Muslims and the rest of the world.        
	Obama has made a good beginning. His words have sent a positive message to the entire world and also to America, Khan said.        
	The more cautious reactions came from Mansoor Mohammed of Zakat India Foundation, a humanitarian organisation, and Kamaludeen Jaffri of the Jamiat Ulema, a religious body.        
	We would like to see if Obama is going to follow up his good words with good action, Mohammed said.        
	He thought the US President had not been even-handed. He was harsh on Irans nuclear programme but silent about Israels, which is more dangerous.        
	Jaffri said: The Muslim world was cautiously watching each and every utterance of his. Obama has said some good words about the community, and we are happy about that. If he meant what he said, then well and fine. But even now he seems to have different attitudes towards Israel and Iran. This is something he has to explain.        
	The US embassy in Delhi arranged a live telecast of the speech at the American Center in Kasturba Gandhi Marg. The speech was followed by a discussion at the American Center led by journalists and Muslim leaders.        
	Positive shift seen        
	Muslims around the world and even radical groups such as the Hamas praised Barack Obamas address as a positive shift in US attitude and tone but said they wanted him to turn his words into action.         
	Fawzi Barhoum, a Hamas spokesperson in Gaza, said: There is a change between the language of President Obama and previous speeches made by George Bush.... The statements of today did not include a mechanism that can translate his wishes and views into actions.        
	A joint statement by eight Syrian-based radical Palestinian factions, including the Hamas, was harsher in its assessment. Obamas speech is an attempt to mislead people and create more illusions to improve Americas aggressive image in the Arab and Islamic world, it said.                    AP REPORTS

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Pak to register Mumbai cases
                                                                                                               Pak to register Mumbai cases
          NASIR JAFFRY                              
	Islamabad, Feb. 9: Pakistan today decided to register criminal cases against the perpetrators of the Mumbai attacks, wherever they might be, but appeared unwilling to hand them over to India.        
	A meeting of the cabinets defence committee, chaired by Prime Minister Yousaf Raza Gilani in Islamabad, also decided to approach India with questions arising out of the inquiry conducted by the Federal Investigation Agency.        
	The meeting decided that on the basis of the inquiry conducted by FIA, the case should be registered and further investigation be carried out so that the perpetrators, wherever they may be, of the heinous crime are brought to justice in accordance with the law of the land, an official statement said.         
	The defence and foreign ministers, the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff committee, armed forces heads, the ISI chief, the intelligence bureau director and other top civil and defence officials attended the meeting.        
	India had handed Pakistan a 70-page dossier early last month, which contained information about the Lashkar-e-Toibas role in the Mumbai attacks. It urged Islamabad to hand over the conspirators, dismantle the terror infrastructure in Pakistan, and to adhere to all bilateral, multilateral and international obligations to take the Mumbai attackers to task. The dossier, quoting the lone surviving gunman Ajmal Kasab, said all the 10 attackers were Pakistanis.        
	It specifically asked for extradition of Zaki-ur-Rehman Lakhvi and Syed Zarar Shah of the Lashkar, accusing them of masterminding the attacks, training the gunmen and arranging satellite phones and SIM cards for them. Islamabad has refused to hand over any Pakistani to India , but has arrested activists of the Jamaat-ud-Dawa, a front of the Lashkar.

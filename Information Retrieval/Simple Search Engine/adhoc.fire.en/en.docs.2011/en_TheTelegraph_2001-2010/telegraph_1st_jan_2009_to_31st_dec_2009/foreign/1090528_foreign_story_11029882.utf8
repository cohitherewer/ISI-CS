                                                                                                               Mishap kills Tyson child
                            
	Phoenix (Arizona), May 27 (Reuters): The four-year-old daughter of former heavyweight boxing champion Mike Tyson has died after being found with a cord around her neck in an apparent accident at her home, police said yesterday.        
	Exodus Tyson was pronounced deceased at 1845GMT today at the hospital. Our sympathies go out to the family, police spokesman Andy Hill said. Reports said Exodus Tyson was playing near some exercise equipment when she got tangled in a power cord or a rope hanging from a treadmill on Monday.

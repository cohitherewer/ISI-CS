The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Women not passionate about sex
                                                                                                               Women not passionate about sex
                            
	London, June 15 (Reuters): Women are not passionate enough about sex and concentrate too much on feelings to be able to write raunchy stories, the new owner of Britains Erotic Review said today.        
	Determined not to let the magazine be drowned in oestrogen, she said she would have almost exclusively male writers as they knew a lot more about sex. I think women, too many of them, whether its nature or nurture or politics, theyre not straightforward about sex, Kate Copstick said.        
	Its almost like writing about food... Ladies who lunch, should not really write about food because they dont really love food. They dont salivate at the thought of a great steak. A former writer for the magazine, she bought the publication in May from its original founder, Jamie Maclean.

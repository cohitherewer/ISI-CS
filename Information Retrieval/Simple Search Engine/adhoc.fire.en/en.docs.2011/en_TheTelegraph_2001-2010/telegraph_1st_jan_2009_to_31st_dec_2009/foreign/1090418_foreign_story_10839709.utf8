The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Taliban exploit class rifts in Pakistan

          JANE PERLEZ AND PIR ZUBAIR SHAH                          Peshawar residents celebrate the deal to impose Sharia in the Swat Valley of Pakistan. (AP)                                  
	Peshawar, April 17: The Taliban have advanced deeper into Pakistan by engineering a class revolt that exploits profound fissures between a small group of wealthy landlords and their landless tenants, according to officials here.         
	The strategy cleared a path to power for the Taliban in the Swat Valley, where the government allowed Islamic law or Sharia to be imposed this week, and it carries broad dangers for the rest of Pakistan, particularly the militants main goal, the populous heartland of Punjab.         
	In Swat, accounts from those who have fled now make clear that the Taliban seized control by pushing out about four dozen landlords who held the most power. To do so, the militants organised peasants into armed gangs that became their shock troops, the residents, government officials and analysts said.         
	The approach allowed the Taliban to offer economic spoils to people frustrated with lax and corrupt government even as the militants imposed a strict form of Islam through terror.         
	This was a bloody revolution in Swat, said a senior Pakistani official who oversees Swat, speaking on the condition of anonymity for fear of retaliation by the Taliban. I wouldnt be surprised if it sweeps the established order of Pakistan.         
	The Talibans ability to exploit class divisions adds a new dimension to the insurgency and is raising alarm about the risks to Pakistan, which remains largely feudal.         
	Unlike India after independence in 1947, Pakistan maintained a narrow landed upper class that kept its vast holdings while its workers remained subservient, the officials and analysts said. Successive Pakistani governments have since failed to provide land reform and even the most basic forms of education and health care. Avenues to advancement for the vast majority of rural poor do not exist.         
	Analysts and other government officials warn that the strategy executed in Swat is easily transferable to Punjab, saying that the province, where militant groups are already showing strength, is ripe for the same social upheavals that have convulsed Swat and the tribal areas.         
	Mahboob Mahmood, a Pakistani-American lawyer and former classmate of President Obama, said: The people of Pakistan are psychologically ready for a revolution.         
	Sunni militancy is taking advantage of deep class divisions that have long festered in Pakistan, he said. The militants, for their part, are promising more than just proscriptions on music and schooling, he said. The Taliban strategy in Swat, an area of 1.3 million people with fertile orchards, vast plots of timber and valuable emerald mines, unfolded in stages over five years, analysts said.        
	The momentum of the insurgency built in the past two years, when the Taliban, reinforced by seasoned fighters from the tribal areas with links to al Qaida, fought the Pakistani Army to a standstill, said a Pakistani intelligence agent who works in the Swat region.         
	The insurgents struck at any competing point of power: landlords and elected leaders  who were usually the same people  and an underpaid and unmotivated police force, said Khadim Hussain, a linguistics and communications professor at Bahria University in Islamabad. At the same time, the Taliban exploited the resentments of the landless tenants, particularly the fact that they had many unresolved cases against their bosses in a slow-moving and corrupt justice system.

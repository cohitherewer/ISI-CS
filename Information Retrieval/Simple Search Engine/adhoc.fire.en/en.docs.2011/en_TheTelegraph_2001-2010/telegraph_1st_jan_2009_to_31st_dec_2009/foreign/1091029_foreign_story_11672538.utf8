The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Gunmen storm UN guest house in Kabul
                                                                                                               Gunmen storm UN guest house in Kabul
                            
	Kabul, Oct. 28 (Reuters): Taliban militants killed six UN foreign staff members in an assault on an international guest house in Kabul today, deepening concerns about security for a presidential election run-off due in 10 days.        
	A resurgent Taliban have vowed to disrupt the November 7 run-off as President Barack Obama weighs whether to send more troops to Afghanistan.        
	In another sign of the growing reach of militants, rockets were also fired at a foreign-owned luxury hotel near the presidential palace in the heart of the Afghan capital, forcing more than 100 guests into a bunker, a foreign hotel guest said.        
	The Taliban said they had targeted the guest house because of the UNs role in helping organise the run-off vote.        
	We have said that we would attack anyone engaged in the process and todays attack is just a start, Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid said by telephone. One foreign woman screamed and sobbed as she limped from the guest-house. Onlookers and police carried another victim away using a blanket as a stretcher. It doesnt look good in there, a UN medic said.

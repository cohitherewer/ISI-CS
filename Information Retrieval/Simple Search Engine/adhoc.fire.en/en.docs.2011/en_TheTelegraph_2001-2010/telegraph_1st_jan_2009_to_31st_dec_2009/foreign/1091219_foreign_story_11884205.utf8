  - Summons in graft case        NASIR JAFFRY AND AGENCIES                           Malik: Cornered                                        
	Islamabad, Dec. 18: Pakistan interior minister Rehman Malik has been summoned by an anti-corruption court in Karachi on January 8 after a graft case involving the minister was re-opened.        
	Yesterday, the National Accountability Bureau (NAB), Pakistans anti-corruption agency, revived cases against 8,014 politicians and bureaucrats who had benefited from the National Reconciliation Order. The amnesty was rejected by the Supreme Court on Wednesday.         
	Malik has already been included in a list of people who have been barred from leaving the country.        
	Earlier, reports said the court had issued an arrest warrant for Malik but legal officials and the ministers counsel Khwaja Naveed Ahmed clarified that he had been summoned by Judge Mir Muhammad Shaikh.         
	Last night, defence minister Chaudhry Ahmad Mukhtar was stopped from travelling to China on an official visit because his name was on the Exit Control List.        
	However, Mukhtar told a TV channel today that NAB chairman Naveed Ahsan had apologised for the incident.         
	He added that his name was not on the list. Prime Minister Yousaf Raza Gilani today suspended the interior secretary for preventing Mukhtar from going to China.        
	Among those who had been issued summons by the anti-corruption court include Pakistan Peoples Party leader in Sindh, Agha Siraj Durrani.

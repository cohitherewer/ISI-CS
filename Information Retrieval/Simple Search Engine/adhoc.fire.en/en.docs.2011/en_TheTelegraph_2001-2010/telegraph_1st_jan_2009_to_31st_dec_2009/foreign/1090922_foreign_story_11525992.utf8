The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Indian mother faces life for killing daughters
                                                                                                               Indian mother faces life for killing daughters
          AMIT ROY                          The two sisters, Davina and Jasmine, who were murdered by their mother in Stretham, Cambridgeshire                                  
	London, Sept. 21: A jury of seven women and five men took barely half an hour today at Cambridge Crown Court to find an Indian mother, Rekha Kumari-Baker, guilty of murdering her two daughters, Davina, 16, and Jasmine, 13, with kitchen knives while they were asleep.        
	Rekha, 41, had pleaded guilty to the lesser charge of manslaughter on the grounds of diminished responsibility but the prosecution insisted on pressing murder charges against her. This means the judge will have no option but to send her to prison for life when he passes sentence tomorrow though he may also recommend treatment.        
	 The prosecution have suggested that Rekha killed her daughters to hit back at her husband, David Baker, following their divorce.        
	In a statement read on his behalf, the girls father said: I was robbed of my daughters by an act of calculated viciousness by a woman who, having given life to them, in her vindictive mind believed she also had a right to take that life from them.        
	 Indian families in Britain are much admired for their closeness but the horror and exceptional circumstances of this case was summed up by Detective Inspector Jim McCrorie, the senior investigating officer, who said: In 25 years in the police service I have never before investigated such an upsetting or sickening crime.        
	The girls were repeatedly stabbed by their mother, the older daughter first, and then the younger one, with kitchen knives she had expressly bought for the purpose. The prosecution suggested that Rekha wanted to wreak havoc on her ex-husband.        
	The killings took place at Rekhas home in Stretham, Cambridgeshire, in the early hours of June 13, 2007, after the girls had been lured into a sense of false security by their mother who had taken them on shopping trips.         
	It became clear, as this investigation progressed, that Rekha Kumari-Baker set out to murder her children, said McCrorie.         
	Davina and Jasmine were two innocent young teenagers who were killed by the person they should have been able to trust most in this world. Only she will know the reasons why she carried out such a vicious and deliberate attack as they lay sleeping in their beds.        
	Rekhas lawyers argued that she was suffering from an abnormality of mind. In a hand-written note she left at the murder scene, Rekha said: I dont want them to get hurt as I did. My kids will not be a burden to anyone anymore.        
	Rekha was also bitter after the break-up of a relationship with her boyfriend, Jeff Power.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Victory lap on LTTE debris
                                                                                                               Victory lap on LTTE debris
                            
	Kilinochchi, Jan. 4 (AP): Battle tanks rumbled north, attack helicopters flew overhead and artillery fire roared through the jungles as Sri Lankan forces pushed ahead today with an offensive aimed at capturing the Tamil Tigers last strongholds and crushing the rebel group.        
	Two days after the military seized the LTTEs administrative capital of Kilinochchi, the government led a victory tour of the newly seized areas in the north, providing journalists a rare glimpse of the war zone.        
	The army was using Paranthan Junction, a strategic crossroads the military captured on Thursday, as a staging area to send troops into the fight for two of the biggest prizes remaining in the battle, the rebel-held areas of Elephant Pass to the north and Mullaittivu to the east.        
	The military said today that troops continued to push deeper into insurgent territory, and one rebel was killed in new fighting.        
	From Paranthan Junction, artillery barrages aimed at the rebel areas could be heard every two minutes.        
	Tanks rolled out of the crossroads, lined with war-damaged buildings and a pulverised gas station. A memorial to slain rebel fighters in the middle of the road was now surrounded by flags from the army units that captured the area.        
	The government has barred independent journalists from travelling to this area for a year and a half, but it agreed to bring reporters here to show off its success.        
	Major General Jagath Dias, who commanded the battle for Kilinochchi, said the town would be used as the main staging area to launch future offensives against the Tamil Tigers.

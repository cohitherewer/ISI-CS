	Clumsy Parker    
	 London, Dec. 9: Actress Sarah Jessica Parker suffered a wardrobe malfunction on the red carpet at the London premiere of Did You Hear About The Morgans?, reports The Daily Telegraph.      
	The Sex and the City actress turned heads in a strapless pink mini dress designed by LWren Scott, but needed to readjust her outfit after briefly revealing more than she intended.      
	She walked down the red carpet at Londons Leicester Square with co-star Hugh Grant, whose former girlfriend Liz Hurley also came to lend her support.       
	 Berlin (Reuters): A young woman in Germany, who burst into tears when police fined her for speeding, received an early Christmas present when another woman caught for the same offence paid the charge. The older driver was so moved by the womans crying at the police station that she pulled out her purse and handed over the money.

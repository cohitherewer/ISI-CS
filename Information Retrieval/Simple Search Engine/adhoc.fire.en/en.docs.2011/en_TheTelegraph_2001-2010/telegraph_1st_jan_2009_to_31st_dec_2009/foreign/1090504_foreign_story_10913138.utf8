The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Berlusconi divorce
                                                                                                               Berlusconi divorce
                            
	Rome, May 3 (Reuters): Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconis wife wants a divorce, Italian media reported today, just days after she publicly criticised as shameless rubbish his plan to field attractive television showgirls as candidates in Junes European elections.        
	I have been forced to take this step, I dont want to add anything else, La Stampa newspaper quoted Berlusconis wife Veronica, 52, as saying, adding she had already contacted a lawyer. La Repubblica daily and ANSA news agency also carried the report.        
	In a two-line statement, the Prime Minister said: This is a personal matter that saddens me, that is private, and it seems appropriate not to talk about it.

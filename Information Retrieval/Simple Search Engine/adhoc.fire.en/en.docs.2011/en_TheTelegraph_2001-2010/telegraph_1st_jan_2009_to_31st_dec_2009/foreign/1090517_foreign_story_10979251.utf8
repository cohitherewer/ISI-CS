The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Lanka army cuts off Tiger escape route

	Colombo, May 16 (Agencies): Sri Lankan troops today seized the entire coastline for the first time in its 25-year war with the Tamil Tigers, the military said, cutting off escape for separatist rebels now facing total destruction.        
	The Sri Lankan defence ministry said the Tiger leaders may be preparing to commit mass suicide.        
	Two divisions marching from north and south sealed the coast, while a third completed the encirclement of the Tigers and their leaders, now trapped in barely a square kilometre and without their umbilical access to the sea.         
	President Mahinda Rajapaksa, on a visit to Jordan, said he would return to Sri Lanka tomorrow as a leader of a nation that vanquished terrorism, even though military operations were still under way.        
	A naval spokesman said Prabhakaran was still leading a small but loyal group of fighters and wanted to put up a final stand in the square kilometre that they still control. The spokesman, citing information given by arrested family members of the Sea Tigers chief T. Sivanesan  better known as Col Soosoi, said the 54-year-old Prabhakaran was still inside the no-fire zone.         
	 Soosais wife told the Lankans that, other than Prabhakaran, key Tiger leader Pottu Amman was trapped in the last bastion.        
	Amman, the Tiger intelligence chief, is one of the prime accused wanted for plotting the assassination of Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi.         
	 According to the defence ministry, the Tigers senior leaders are hoping to prolong their defeat by using civilians as shields and suicide bombers. The rebels have nowhere to go and the only way out is to surrender or be crushed in the military advance, an army official said.        
	They are blowing up large explosives and ammunition dumps and also using stocks of white phosphorous with improvised barrel bombs to create large destruction in the makeshift refugee camps, the ministry said.        
	Military spokesman Brigadier Udaya Nanayakkara said more civilians were fleeing the battle zone. Nearly 10,000 escaped yesterday, bringing the two-day total to 15,000.        
	The Tigers this week again refused to surrender and free civilians, while the government rejected calls to pause its assault to protect the people. That signalled a military finish to a war despite the strong urgings of the UN Security Council.

	Sydney, April 8: Australian actor Hugh Jackman has been forced to apologise for a gaffe on micro-blogging site Twitter, in which the actor got the name of the world-famous Sydney Opera House wrong.         
	It emerged the Australian actor was using a staff member to compile entries on the site.         
	Jackman, who was born and bred in Sydney but now lives in Los Angeles, was visiting his native country as part of a world tour promoting his new film, when an update appeared on his Twitter feed reading: Having lunch on the harbor [sic] across from the Opera Center. Loving life!        
	Eyebrows were raised not only at the use of the word Center instead of House in relation to Australias most famous building, but also at the American-style spelling.         
	Outraged at the error, the Sydney Morning Herald newspaper contacted Jackmans publicist, who initially blamed the gaffe on spell-checking problems with Jackmans Blackberry.         
	However, she had no excuse to offer for his apparent renaming of the Opera House: Yes, he did [write that], she told the paper.                            THE DAILY TELEGRAPH

	Kathmandu, April 7: Nepals fifth national games, being held after a gap of 10 years, got off to a rocky start today after the Nepal Army pulled out its contingent in protest against the Maoist-led governments decision to allow the Peoples Liberation Army (PLA) to take part in the event.         
	The PLA said that it had a legitimate right to take part in the games along with other security agencies like the army, the Nepal Police and the armed police. The Maoists had threatened to disrupt the games if the PLA was not allowed to take part.

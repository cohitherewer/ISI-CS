The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Harry sorry for Paki gaffe
                                                                                                               Harry sorry for Paki gaffe
                              Harry: Apologetic                            
	London, Jan. 11 (AP): Lawmakers, Muslim groups and the Pakistani public criticised Prince Harry today after a British newspaper published video footage of him using offensive and racist language, including the word Paki.        
	Harry issued an apology yesterday after the News of The World reported that he had used offensive terms to refer to people from Pakistan and people of Arab descent.        
	Britains Opposition Conservative Party leader David Cameron said Harrys comments undermined work to root out racism from the countrys armed forces. It is obviously a completely unacceptable thing to say, Cameron told the BBC.        
	Harry is purported to have made the remarks in 2006 during a visit to Cyprus to carry out training exercises. In the video, Harry is heard to refer to one colleague as our little Paki friend  using a derogatory term for people of Pakistani origin.        
	In a second video clip, Harry is heard to call another cadet  who was wearing a headscarf  a raghead.        
	St. Jamess Palace  the office of Harry and his elder brother William  said yesterday that Harry was sorry for any offense caused by his use of the word Paki. Spokesperson Patrick Harrison said Harry had used the other offensive term to refer to either the Taliban or Iraqi insurgents.        
	Ahmed Raza Khans uncle Iftikhar Raja told the BBC the cadet was now a captain in Pakistans army. He said Khan had received an award from Queen Elizabeth II as the best overseas officer cadet. We expect better from our royal family on whom we spend millions and millions of pounds for training and schooling, Raja said.        
	Harrys comments is sickening and he should be thoroughly ashamed of himself, said Mohammed Shafiq, the director of the Ramadan Foundation  a British Muslim youth organisation.        
	Labour Party lawmaker Khalid Mahmood also criticised Harry over the comments. He needs to understand that this is not acceptable, especially in light of the office that he is going to hold in the army and as a member of the royal family.        
	Mohammad Arslan, a technician in Islamabad, said: We have all the abilities to call the prince something or anything, and things about his father and mother, but we dont do that because we believe that is wrong.         
	In Multan schoolteacher Ibrar Ahmed said: Lets be fair about it. Dogs may bark, but people go about their business, Ahmed said.        
	Britains defence ministry said it did not tolerate inappropriate behavior, but said no complaint had been raised against Harry.

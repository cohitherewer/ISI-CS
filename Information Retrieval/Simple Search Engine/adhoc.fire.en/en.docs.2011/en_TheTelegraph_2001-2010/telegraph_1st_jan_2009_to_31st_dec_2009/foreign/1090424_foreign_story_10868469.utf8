	Colombo, April 23 (Agencies): Sri Lankan forces today surrounded a small strip of land in the north where Tiger chief Velupillai Prabhakaran is believed to be holed up.        
	They also deployed warships to prevent the rebels from escaping.        
	Backed by tanks, the security forces surrounded the 8 squarekm jungle patch, where an estimated 800-900 Tamil Tigers were still offering resistance, the army said.        
	According to the Sri Lankan army chief, Sarath Fonseka, the navy has been put on alert to prevent any attempt by Prabhakaran or other senior LTTE leaders from fleeing the country.        
	We do not know the exact place where he is hiding but we suspect, he most probably is hiding amongst civilians trying to take cover behind them, Fonseka said.        
	According to the orders given to us by the government, we are continuing our mission to destroy the terrorists. These days we have a greater mission. We have to save the civilians who are used as human shields, the army chief told BBC.        
	He said there could be a maximum of 15,000 civilians in the remaining LTTE areas in the no fire zone. There are around 300-400 cadres though around 700 civilians are forced to take up arms and are also deployed in bunkers, Fonseka said.        
	Officials said the number of people, who crossed over from the no fire zone since Monday, rose to 103,143, according to officials. Fonseka said he had information that certain activities had taken place in the sea routes to which LTTE has access.        
	I also think that this time around he (Prabhakaran) will attempt to reach his desired destination via sea, he said, adding: We are set to destroy him. However, he admitted that troops were facing stiff resistance from the remaining LTTE cadres.        
	The army chief said the security forces primary task, at the moment, was to get the trapped Tamil civilians out of the war zone to safety.        
	Aid agencies today said that the Lanka authorities were struggling to cope with more than 100,000 people who have fled Sri Lankas war zone.        
	The military said a four-day exodus was beginning to slow, with some 103,000 people having come to army-held areas since troops cleared an earthen barrier the LTTE had built to stop them from escaping.         
	The International Committee of the Red Cross said fighting had blocked the evacuation of wounded by sea and the delivery of aid supplies by a ship. We are negotiating with the parties in terms of having a safe area around the boats to allow the fishermen to bring the wounded to us, ICRC spokesman Simon Schorno said in Geneva.        
	The ICRC lowered its estimate of civilians still trapped in a narrow coastal strip on the islands north to less than 50,000.         
	Military spokesman Brigadier Udaya Nanayakkara said operations to finish Asias longest-running war would not let up. He denied LTTE accusations that troops were using artillery: We are not using heavy weapons at all. We are only using small arms, Nanayakkara said.        
	Independent confirmation of battlefield accounts is difficult because outsiders are generally restricted from it.        
	The UN Security Council late yesterday said it had deep concern for the welfare of those remaining inside the LTTE-held area, which is surrounded by troops.        
	The military says troops now control all but 13 squarekm of the Indian Ocean island, where the LTTE is fighting a last stand in their war to create a separate state for the Tamil minority. A UN spokesman said the world body had confirmed that between 90,000 and 100,000 people had left the combat zone since Monday.

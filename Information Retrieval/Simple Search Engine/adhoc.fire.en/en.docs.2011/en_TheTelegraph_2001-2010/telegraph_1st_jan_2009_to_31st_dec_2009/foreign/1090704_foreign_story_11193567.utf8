The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Gold coffin for Jacko
                                                                                                               Gold coffin for Jacko
                            
	London, July 3: Michael Jackson will be buried in a solid bronze, gold-plated coffin worth $25,0000, it has been reported.        
	The casket, called a Promethean, will feature a blue velvet interior and a hand-polished, mirror finish, according to TMZ.com.         
	It is the same type of coffin which soul singer James Brown was buried in.         
	Jackson saw the casket first hand when he paid tribute to the singer as he lay in state in New York Citys Apollo Theatre.        
	Browns body was transported to the theatre on a white carriage similar to that seen in the last few days at Jacksons Neverland ranch.         
	Yesterday it emerged that Jacksons funeral will be held on Tuesday at the Staples Centre, the home of basketball team LA Lakers in Los Angeles.         
	The stadium holds 20,000 people and, if the Jackson family takes up the offer, large television screens will be placed outside for thousands of other fans to watch.         
	Sources close to the family say they are fully committed to holding a public memorial for his fans and are being guided by what Michael would have wanted.         
	The Jackson family met the Los Angeles Police Department and the California Highway Patrol to discuss possible funeral arrangements in the city, a police spokesperson said.         
	Another venue has had to be found after an initial plan to hold an event at Jacksons Neverland ranch was blocked by red tape.        
	The current whereabouts of Jacksons body is being kept a closely guarded secret.                     THE DAILY TELEGRAPH

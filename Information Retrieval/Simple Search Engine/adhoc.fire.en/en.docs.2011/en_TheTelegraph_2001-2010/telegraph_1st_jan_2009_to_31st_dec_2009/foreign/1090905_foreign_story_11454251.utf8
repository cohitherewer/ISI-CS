The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | US Kabul embassy guards fired
                                                                                                               US Kabul embassy guards fired

	Kabul, Sept. 4: Eight security guards at the US embassy in Kabul have been sacked following allegations of lewd behaviour and sexual misconduct in their living quarters.        
	 Two more have resigned and all ten have been sent home immediately. The entire Kabul senior management team of ArmorGroup North America, the private contractor providing the guards, has been replaced, an embassy spokesman said.        
	Secretary of state Hillary Clinton ordered an investigation into the behaviour of the guards after allegations that a Lord of the Flies atmosphere prevailed among 450 guards stationed at the Camp Sullivan compound in Kabul.        
	Photographs of nearly nude guards and supervisors dancing round and urinating on a fire have embarrassed the US in one of the most conservative countries in the world.

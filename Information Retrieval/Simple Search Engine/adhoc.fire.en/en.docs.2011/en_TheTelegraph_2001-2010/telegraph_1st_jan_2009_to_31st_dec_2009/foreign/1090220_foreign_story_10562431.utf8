The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Harvard to hike fees
                                                                                                               Harvard to hike fees
                            
	Boston, Feb. 19 (Reuters): Harvard University has said it will slow construction on its new Allston campus, let staff retire early, hold salaries flat and raise tuition fees to save money because its endowment suffered a big loss.        
	Facing very difficult economic conditions, Harvard President Drew Faust said the school will reassess construction plans for a new science complex in Bostons Allston neighbourhood after the foundation is finished at the end of this year. We will explore whether there are feasible ways to lessen the complexs costs, Faust wrote to students, faculty and staff yesterday in a letter detailing a string of savings the worlds richest university plans to implement.        
	Late last year Harvard shocked the investment and education communities by saying that its $36.9 billion endowment had lost 22 per cent, or roughly $8 billion, in the first four months of the fiscal year that began in July.        
	Faust said yesterday that she expects the endowment to lose 30 per cent during the 2008/2009 fiscal year and have its worst annual return in 40 years. The endowment will likely be around $26 billion at that time, the level it was last at in 2005. By long relying on alternative investments like hedge funds, real estate and timber, Harvard had delivered an average annualised investment return of 13.8 per cent over the last decade. Faust declined to say what steps Harvar might be taking.

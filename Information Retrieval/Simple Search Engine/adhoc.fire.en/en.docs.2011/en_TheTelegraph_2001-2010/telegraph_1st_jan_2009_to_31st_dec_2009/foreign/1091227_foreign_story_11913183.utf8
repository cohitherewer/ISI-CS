The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Yard probes Detroit bombers UK links
                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      Yard probes Detroit bombers UK links
          AMIT ROY                                    
	London, Dec. 26: Scotland Yard forensic specialists were today searching a mansion in central London where the student, accused of trying to blow up an American plane near Detroit with 278 passengers and 11 crew on board, was supposed to have lived.        
	The name of the 23-year-old Nigerian, Abdul Farouk Abdulmutallab, whose details were passed by US federal authorities to Scotland Yard, almost exactly matched that of a student, Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab, who had been on the roll call of University College London (UCL).        
	 The probability is they are one and the same, though the building Scotland Yard is searching does not resemble either a college hall of residence or the kind of typical bedsitter that the majority of students have to rent. A blue English Heritage plaque states that philanthropist Sir Robert Mayer once lived there.        
	 So how did Umar, if he is indeed the suspected bomber, get the kind of money to rent such an exclusive basement flat so close to Harley Street where the most expensive doctors in London  they sting their patients even more than their counterparts in Calcutta  have their surgeries?        
	 Another question that will be asked is whether tutors at University College London really satisfied that Umar was a fit person to study engineering.        
	If terrorists are going start looking for recruits from among students, it obviously helps if they are studying a science subject and used to doing laboratory experiments.        
	British universities are keen to recruit as many students as possible from abroad since they are a valuable source of funding but now renewed attempt will have to be made to weed out potential terrorists.        
	It will be recalled that in 2007 a brilliant student from Bangalore, Kafeel Ahmed, aged 28, an engineer with a PhD, suffered 90 per cent burns on June 30 when he rammed a vehicle at Glasgow airport terminal. He died without gaining consciousness on August 2 and was buried in an unidentified grave somewhere in the UK. His family did not want even to reclaim his body, but his younger brother, Sabeel, then 26, has now been allowed to leave the UK and return home.        
	A spokesman for University College London  one of the best colleges in the country  made a grudging admission today: Media outlets are suggesting several different names for the man arrested in connection with an attempted act of terrorism on Northwest Airlines Flight 253 in the early hours of December 26. UCL can confirm that a student by the name of Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab was enrolled on a Mechanical Engineering course at the institution between September 2005 and June 2008.        
	 However, it must be stressed that the university has no evidence that this is the same person currently being referred to in the media. Until the situation becomes clearer, UCL will not be making any further comment.        
	These are early days for the investigation but preliminary reports suggest two findings: with liquids now banned from carry on luggage, the terrorists may have evolved a new way of smuggling explosive powder onto a flight by hiding it strapped on the inside of legs.        
	Another is terrorists have learnt not to take a direct flight to a destination in the US but begin it somewhere outside Europe, where check-in security might not be so tight, and then transfer at another airport to the plane targeted for the subsequent explosion. It seems this is what Umar appears to have done.        
	The suspect was on a British intelligence database but was not on the governments no-fly list, meaning he was known to authorities but not considered a high risk.        
	He is believed to have boarded KLM Flight 588 in Lagos, the Nigerian capital, bound for Amsterdam.        
	Airports in Nigeria do not typically conduct tests for explosive residue on passengers carry-on baggage and shoes.        
	 In Amsterdam, Umar connected to Northwest Airlines 253, heading for Detroit in an Airbus A330 bearing the colours of the airlines new owner, Delta.        
	Umar was jumped by quick thinking and quick acting passengers as he was apparently trying to detonate a mixture of powder and liquid strapped to his leg. The aircraft was 20 minutes from touchdown at Detroit. The mixture failed to explode properly but caught fire, leaving him with third degree burns.        
	Umar was removed in handcuffs on a stretcher when the Airbus landed and is now being encouraged to tell everything he knows to US officers. This intelligence is being passed to Scotland Yard.        
	ABC News reported that Umar was flying from Nigeria to the United States for a religious ceremony, according to his entry visa. This was said to have been issued on June 16 last year and was valid until June 12, 2010. If that is true, the terrorists are playing a long game, planting sleepers in key western cities.        
	 A Scotland Yard spokeswoman confirmed: We are in liaison with the US authorities. Searches are being carried out at addresses in central London.        
	A UK Department for Transport spokeswoman added: In response to events in Detroit the US authorities have requested additional measures for US-bound flights. Though Umar is said to have retracted this statement, Umar reportedly told investigators he is linked to Al Qaida and obtained the explosives in Yemen.        
	 Terrorism expert Dr Sally Leivesley told BBC News: This looks as though it is a first attempt of a new way to use the body to conceal explosives.        
	Airport operator BAA said in a statement: Passengers travelling to the United States should expect their airline to carry out additional security checks prior to boarding. We would advise passengers to leave more time to check in.        
	 The prime minister Gordon Brown, who has been in contact with Sir Paul Stephenson, the Commissioner of the Metropolitan Police, because of the serious potential threat, commented: The security of the public must always be our primary concern. We have been working closely with the US authorities investigating this incident since it happened.        
	Umar has reminded terrorism experts of Richard Reid, who tried to destroy a trans-Atlantic flight in 2001 with explosives hidden in his shoes, but was subdued by other passengers. Reid is serving a life sentence.        
	London is sometimes disparagingly referred to as Londonistan because of the number of terror cells said to be operating from the city.        
	But Home Secretary Alan Johnson pledged: The public will be concerned, but I want them to know that the police are working with their American colleagues on the investigation to uncover the full background to the incident. With the full support of the PM, Transport Secretary, Foreign Secretary and ministerial colleagues, we will ensure that the UK continues to have in place the most appropriate security measures to protect the public from the terrorist threat wherever it originates from.

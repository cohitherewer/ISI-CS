	Jerusalem, June 14 (Reuters): Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu today said he would accept the creation of a Palestinian state if Israel received international guarantees the new nation would have no military.        
	If we receive this guarantee for demilitarisation and the security arrangements required by Israel, and if the Palestinians recognise Israel as the nation of the Jewish people, we will be prepared for a true peace agreement (and) to reach a solution of a demilitarised Palestinian state alongside the Jewish state, Netanyahu said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Pak launches attack on Taliban 
                                                                                                               Pak launches attack on Taliban

	Islamabad, April 26 (AP): Pakistan sent helicopter gunships and troops to attack Taliban militants today in a district covered by a peace deal after strong US pressure on the nuclear-armed nation to confront insurgents advancing in its northwest.        
	At least 31 people were killed in the offensive, which sent some residents of Lower Dir district fleeing carrying children and few belongings.        
	The operation appeared to endanger a peace pact struck with Taliban militants in neighbouring Swat Valley, although a top official insisted the deal was intact. Another official demanded the insurgents disarm, but a Taliban spokesperson said the militants would not give up their weapons.        
	The Lower Dir offensive also came ahead of Pakistan President Asif Ali Zardaris scheduled meeting with US President Barack Obama in early May, but Pakistani officials denied outside pressure influenced the move.                  
	Television footage from the district showed at least two helicopter gunships heading towards the mountains. Troops guarded a road blocked with paramilitary trucks, while some families sat nearby.         
	The operation killed at least 30 militants, including a commander, plus one paramilitary soldier, according to an army statement and interior ministry chief Rehman Malik. The statement said the operation was launched at the request of the provincial government and local residents.        
	The government agreed to impose Islamic law in Swat and surrounding districts that make up Malakand division if the Taliban there would end their violent campaign in the one-time tourist haven. Critics labelled the deal a surrender to the militants and warned Swat could turn into a haven for allies of al Qaida.        
	In recent days, Taliban forces from Swat began entering Buner, a neighbouring district which lies just 100km from Islamabad. Officials said most of the insurgents pulled out of Buner on Friday amid reports of possible military action, and threats that the government would scrap the deal.        
	Losing either Lower or Upper Dir to the militants would be a blow not only for Pakistan but also for the US because a part of the region borders Afghanistan, where the US is sending thousands more troops to shore up the faltering war effort against a resurgent Taliban.        
	Farhatullah Babar, spokesperson for Zardari, insisted the offensive did not render the peace agreement moot.        
	He said the government would fulfill its pledge to establish an Islamic judicial system in Malakand, a demand of local residents exhausted by the inefficient regular courts  and a grievance exploited by the Taliban.        
	The peace deal is intact, Babar said. At the same time the government is determined to root out the militants hell-bent on destroying the law and order situation.        
	But Malik even spoke of the deal in past tense when saying the Swat militants had to disarm. Enough is enough, Malik said. There is no option for them except to lay down their arms, because the government is serious now to flush them out.        
	Taliban spokesperson Muslim Khan said the militants, do not lay down weapons. Instead they snatch them. He said the Taliban were still trying to abide by the deal but wanted to make sure the newly created Islamic courts had full authority.        
	300 terrorists         
	Pakistani Taliban chief Baitullah Mehsud plans to carry out terror attacks in major cities, including Islamabad, Rawalpindi and Lahore, and has despatched his top five commanders along with 300 terrorists and suicide bombers to execute the mission.        
	The five Taliban commanders will supervise the terrorist operations planned by Mehsud and the Taliban Himayat Tehrik in these cities, interior ministry sources told The News daily.

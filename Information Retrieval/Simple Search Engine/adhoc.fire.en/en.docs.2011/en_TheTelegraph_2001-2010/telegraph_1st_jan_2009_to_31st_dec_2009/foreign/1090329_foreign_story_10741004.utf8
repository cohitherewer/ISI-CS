          JOHN MARKOFF                          Dalai Lama: Spied on                                  
	Toronto, March 28: A vast electronic spying operation has infiltrated computers and has stolen documents from hundreds of government and private offices around the world, including those of the Dalai Lama, Canadian researchers have concluded.        
	In a report to be issued this weekend, the researchers said that the system was being controlled from computers based almost exclusively in China, but that they could not say conclusively that the Chinese government was involved.         
	The researchers, who are based at the Munk Centre for International Studies at the University of Toronto, had been asked by the office of the Dalai Lama, the exiled Tibetan leader whom China regularly denounces, to examine its computers for signs of malicious software, or malware.         
	Their sleuthing opened a window into a broader operation that, in less than two years, has infiltrated at least 1,295 computers in 103 countries, including many belonging to embassies, foreign ministries and other government offices, as well as the Dalai Lamas Tibetan exile centres in India, Brussels, London and New York.         
	The researchers, who have a record of detecting computer espionage, said they believed that in addition to the spying on the Dalai Lama, the system, which they called GhostNet, was focused on the governments of South Asian and Southeast Asian countries.        
	Still going strong, the operation continues to invade and monitor more than a dozen new computers a week, the researchers said in their report, Tracking GhostNet: Investigating a Cyber Espionage Network.         
	They said they had found no evidence that US government offices had been infiltrated, although a Nato computer was monitored by the spies for half a day and computers of the Indian embassy in Washington were infiltrated.         
	The malware is remarkable both for its sweep  in computer jargon, it has not been merely phishing for random consumers information, but whaling for particular important targets  and for its Big Brother-style capacities.         
	It can, for example, turn on the camera and audio-recording functions of an infected computer, enabling monitors to see and hear what goes on in a room. The investigators say they do not know if this facet has been employed. The researchers were able to monitor the commands given to infected computers and to see the names of documents retrieved by the spies.

	London, Nov. 30: The pop star Rihanna has advised women to have naked pictures of themselves taken  while they still can.        
	The American R amp;B singer, whose new single Russian Roulette entered the UK charts at number six yesterday, said that all women should have the confidence to bare their flesh in front of the camera.        
	The 21 year-old said in an interview with The Sun: Every woman should have naked pictures taken. In five years my body might not look like this.        
	Ive always been borderline raunchy and a little sexy. But sexy at 19 and sexy at 21 are two different things. Im just having fun.        
	Rihanna has become known for her suggestive dance routines and meagre outfits since she first came to prominence in 2005.        
	She admitted to being humiliated earlier this year when naked pictures of herself sent to an ex-boyfriend were posted online.        
	But she later shrugged off the episode, saying: If you dont send your boyfriend naked pictures, then I feel bad for him.        
	The singer, whose real name is Robyn Rihanna Fenty, has been in the UK promoting her new album Rated R, and last night performed on The X Factor. Her single Umbrella spent 10 weeks at number one in 2007.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Clooney meets Obama
                                                                                                               Clooney meets Obama
                              Clooney: No to Oscars                            
	Los Angeles, Feb. 24 (AP): Actor George Clooney apparently had a good reason for skipping out on Oscar night: He had a meeting with President Barack Obama.        
	The Oscar-winning actor appeared yesterday on CNNs Larry King Live and spoke of his visit earlier that morning with Obama to discuss the humanitarian crisis in Darfur, Sudan. Clooney said he told the President of his visit to camps in Chad where 250,000 refugees live, but he downplayed the risks he took to witness the suffering first-hand.        
	I dont think people should be going there and coming back and saying how it affected them, Clooney said.

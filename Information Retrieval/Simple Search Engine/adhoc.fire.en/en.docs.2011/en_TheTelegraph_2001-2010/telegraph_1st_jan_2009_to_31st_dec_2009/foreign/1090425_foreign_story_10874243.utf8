	Beyonce babies    
	 New York, April 24 (Reuters): Grammy Award-winning singer and actress Beyonce Knowles has a plan to settle down in a couple of years and have some children with her husband, hip hop mogul Jay-Z, do less touring and  debut on Broadway.      
	Its my ideal job, Knowles told Reuters, while promoting her latest film role in Obsessed, in which she plays a wife who takes on her husbands stalker.      
	Ill be able to go to the theatre every day and drop my kids off and maybe make some food  maybe Ill know how to cook by then  and then go do what I love and have some normalcy and have a regular schedule. I definitely want to do Broadway.      
	Knowles, 27, said she loved playing Sharon Charles in Obsessed, her first non-singing film role after performances in screen musicals including Cadillac Records and Dreamgirls.

	Vicar roll

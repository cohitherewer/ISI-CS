	Pothole proposal    
	 London, April 16 (AP): A British country village is considering a novel way to frustrate speeders by leaving its potholes in place.      
	The proposal by the Navestock Parish Council 40km northeast of London calls for potholes to serve as a traffic calming device.      
	Councillor Mike Parrish believes this would save the considerable time and money authorities spend on fixing potholes.      
	He said today that potholes on key routes would be repaired but others on minor roads would be kept in place to slow drivers down.      
	The proposal is receiving mixed reactions from residents with some branding the idea dangerous and counterproductive.     
	Foxx tape

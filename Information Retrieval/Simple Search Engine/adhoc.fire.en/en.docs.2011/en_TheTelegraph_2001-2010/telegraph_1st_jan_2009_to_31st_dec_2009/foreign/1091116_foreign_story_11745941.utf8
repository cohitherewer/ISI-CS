	London, Nov. 15: As Pussy Galore, in the 1960s James Bond film Goldfinger, Honor Blackman played a smouldering femme fatale who made short shrift of suitors and enemies alike. Now, the 84-year-old actress has another opponent in her sight  Gordon Brown.         
	Around one million policyholders lost up to half their pensions after Equitable Life almost went bust in 2000. The British government has been blamed for allowing the near collapse to happen but has yet to pay compensation to the victims.         
	Blackman is leading the campaign for justice for fellow victims of the Equitable Life scandal by forcing the UK government to speed up plans to pay an estimated 4 billion in compensation.         
	With 15 Equitable Life members dying on average each day, critics accuse the government of deliberately prevaricating in order to minimise the number of eventual payouts.         
	Blackman, who lost half her Equitable pension, personally blames the Prime Minister for the long delay in paying compensation.         
	She told The Sunday Telegraph: The government has been dragging its heels for years. I point the finger of blame at Gordon Brown. When he was chancellor in 1998 the treasury was informed that Equitable Life was technically insolvent  two years before (it) was closed to new business. He could have done something then, long before we had the credit crunch. And he didnt do anything. He still doesnt.

	 London, Aug. 17: A previously unseen picture of Sir Paul McCartney with his young classmates from the Joseph Williams School in Liverpool is to be auctioned after it turned up in The Beatles Shop, reports The Daily Telegraph.      
	The musician is pictured wearing a black cap and studying a comic. The photograph, from 1952, was recently brought to the shop  30 yards from the original Cavern Club.

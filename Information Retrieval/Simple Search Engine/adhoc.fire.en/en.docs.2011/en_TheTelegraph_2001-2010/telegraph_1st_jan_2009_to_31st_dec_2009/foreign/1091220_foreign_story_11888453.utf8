                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      Storm hits US east coast     -  Emergency declared in Washington, Philadelphia

	Washington, Dec. 19 (AP): A treacherous winter storm slammed the US east coast today, dumping more than 30cm of snow in some areas and creating misery for motorists on the weekend before Christmas.        
	Officials urged residents to stay indoors, and many heeded the warning. A mall near Richmond, Virginia, typically busy this time of year, was nearly deserted as stores opened. Airports cancelled flights or were operating with excessive delays. Drivers abandoned their cars as roads and highways became impassable.        
	Forecasts predicted 50cm of snow across the region. The US capital was blanketed in white.        
	Snowplows cleared the runway at Andrews Air Force Base in suburban Washington as President Barack Obama returned from climate talks in Copenhagen. The White House said Obama rode in a motorcade back to the White House, instead of taking his helicopter, because of the conditions.        
	Washington mayor Adrian Fenty declared a snow emergency for the city and forecasters issued a blizzard warning, saying the conditions could worsen. All Smithsonian museums and the National Zoo were closed.        
	Its going to be an all day thing. Its going to be on and off, said National Weather Service meteorologist Kevin Witt in Sterling, Virginia. Philadelphia also declared a snow emergency and the school district cancelled all weekend activities.        
	 Reagan National Airport and Dulles International Airport outside Washington each had one runway open, but airlines had cancelled most of their flights.        
	Forecasters said the storm system was expected to generate winds up to 56km per hour, which could cause near-whiteout conditions.        
	People stocked up on groceries and other staples yesterday after the National Weather Service issued storm warnings from the Carolinas to Rhode Island.         
	In southern West Virginia, Ron Harts hardware store was swamped as customers bought heaters and other emergency supplies, just a week after a wind storm knocked out electricity and spawned an earlier emergency shopping surge.        
	In western Virginia, officials said several hundred motorists became stranded and had to be rescued by four-wheeled vehicles and Humvees driven by the National Guard. About 100 people were taken to shelters in two counties, said Virginia department of emergency management spokesman Bob Spieldenner.        
	Some folks have decided to stay in vehicles, others have been taken to shelters, Spieldenner said. Were definitely trying to keep people off the roads.        
	Virginia state police spokeswoman Corinne Geller said traffic was moving, though slowly. One fatality had been reported, but otherwise there were no medical emergencies, she said. Its looks probably a lot worse than it is, she said.

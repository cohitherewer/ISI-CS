The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Iran rebuff for Obama
                                                                                                               Iran rebuff for Obama
                            
	Tehran, March 22 (AP): Irans supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, rebuffed US President Barack Obamas latest outreach, saying Tehran was still waiting to see concrete changes in American foreign policy.        
	Ayatollah Khamenei, who holds the ultimate responsibility for Iranian policy decisions, was responding yesterday to a video message Obama released on Friday in which the President expressed hopes for an improvement in nearly 30 years of strained relations.        
	In his most direct public assessment of Obama and prospects for better ties, Ayatollah Khamenei said there could be no change between the countries unless the Obama administration put an end to hostility toward Iran and brought real changes in foreign policy.

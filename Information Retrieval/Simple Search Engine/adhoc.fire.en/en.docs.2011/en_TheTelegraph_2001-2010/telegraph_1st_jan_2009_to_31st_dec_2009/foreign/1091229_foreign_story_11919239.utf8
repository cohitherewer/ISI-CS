	Paris, Dec. 28: French First Lady Carla Bruni has been accused of nepotism after her sons godfather was given a 4,500 a month government job.        
	The appointment of Francois Baudot as the new inspector general of cultural affairs comes after a recent poll found half of all French people believe Bruni is meddling in Frances politics. Baudot  a 60-year-old former interior designer friend of Brunis for 15 years  will now work alongside the First Ladys other close friend, culture minister Frederic Mitterrand.        
	French news magazine Le Point said it had received information that a government appointments commission had first decided Baudot was not suitable for the new job.        
	But it then changed its mind after its members were informed that President Nicolas Sarkozy, his Prime Minister Francois Fillon and Frederic Mitterrand all backed Baudot for the new post, Le Point said.        
	But the magazine also admitted that Baudot  a former government commissioner for Frances museums and monuments  had a pretty good CV for the new job.        
	Last month a Readers Digest poll found 48 per cent of people thought the former supermodel was very influential in her husbands policy-making.        
	And two months before that Bruni was described by Frances leading society magazine Point de Vue as the new Marie-Antionette, who had bewitched President Nicolas Sarkozy with her socialist views.        
	Some leading members of Sarkozys own UMP party were reported to have told the President that he was under his wifes thumb and causing him a catalogue of problems.        
	They said voters were appalled by her support for her friend Mitterrand after he admitted his past as a sex tourist in Asia. One unnamed MP told the highbrow Express news magazine in October: She is responsible for most of the head of states woes.

          DAVID JOHNSTON AND SCOTT SHANE                                                Hasan: Radical links    
	Washington, Nov. 10: Intelligence agencies last year and this year intercepted communications between the military psychiatrist accused of shooting to death 13 people at Fort Hood, Texas, and a radical cleric in Yemen known for his incendiary anti-American teachings.        
	However, federal authorities dropped an inquiry into the matter after deciding that the messages from the psychiatrist, Major Nidal Malik Hasan, did not suggest any threat of violence and concluding that no further action was warranted, government officials said yesterday.        
	Major Hasans 10 to 20 messages to Anwar al-Awlaki, once a spiritual leader at a mosque in suburban Virginia where Hasan worshiped, indicate that the troubled military psychiatrist came to the attention of the authorities long before last Thursdays shooting rampage at Fort Hood. However, in spite of the information, the authorities left him in his post.        
	Counterterrorism and military officials said last night that the communications, first intercepted last December as part of an unrelated investigation, were consistent with a research project the psychiatrist was then conducting at Walter Reed Army Medical Center in Washington on post-traumatic stress disorder.        
	There was no indication that Major Hasan was planning an imminent attack at all, or that he was directed to do anything, one senior investigator said. He and the other officials spoke on the condition of anonymity, saying the case was under investigation.        
	The officials said the departments of defence and justice had decided Hasan would be prosecuted in a military court, an indication that investigators believe he acted alone.         
	Government lawyers had said his case might be tried in civilian court if he were believed to have conspired with nonmilitary defendants.        
	In a statement, the FBI said: At this point, there is no information to indicate Major Nidal Malik Hasan had any co-conspirators or was part of a broader terrorist plot. The statement concluded that because the content of the communications was explainable by his research and nothing else was found, investigators decided that Major Hasan was not involved in terrorist activities or terrorist planning.

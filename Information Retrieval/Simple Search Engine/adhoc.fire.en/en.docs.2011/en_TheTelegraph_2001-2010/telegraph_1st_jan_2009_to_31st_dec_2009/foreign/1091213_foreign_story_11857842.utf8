  - Radio host faces President ire after stupid question                            question of honour                                  
	London, Dec. 12: Nicolas Sarkozy has confronted a radio presenter who asked his wife, Carla Bruni: Would you love him so much if he wasnt President of France?        
	Sarkozy is said to have cornered the outspoken radio host, Marc-Olivier Fogiel, at an awards ceremony at the Elysee Palace. The President was described by witnesses to have stormed up to the surprised DJ to defend his wifes honour.        
	The stand-off came after Fogiel interviewed the French First Lady on his chat show on radio station Europe 1 last week.        
	He reminded listeners how Sarkozy met Bruni on a blind date at a Paris dinner party more than two years ago, then proposed on Christmas day after a two-month whirlwind romance. He then bluntly asked about her love for the 54-year-old President.        
	The stunning 41-year-old former supermodel replied simply: Thats a bit of a stupid question.        
	At the Elysee Palace this week, Sarkozy was heard to have told Fogiel: I dont appreciate the way you spoke to my wife. It was a clumsy question. I wont forget about it.        
	Fogiel was at the Elysee to watch his colleague Dominque Farrugia be awarded the Frances highest gong the Legion dHonneur.        
	He said afterwards: The President told me he found the question clumsy. Perhaps it was, but it was one that had to be asked.        
	David Verges, a French media commentator, said: Mr Fogiel only expressed publicly what a lot of people have been thinking. Thats his job.        
	Rock star better        
	Sarkozy said yesterday he was relieved that veteran French rocker Johnny Hallyday appeared to be getting better after undergoing an operation at a Los Angeles hospital.

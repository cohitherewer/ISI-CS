The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Hasina bid to calm army
                                                                                                               Hasina bid to calm army
  - Dhaka seeks American support in mutiny probe        OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          A border guard kisses his son as he reports back to the BDR headquarters in Dhaka on Sunday. (AP)                                        
	Dhaka, March 1: Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina rushed to Bangladeshs main military garrison in Dhaka today and explained to army commanders the measures her government had taken to quell the mutiny by Bangladesh Rifles guards.        
	She has also sought the support of the US and the UK for investigations into the mutiny.        
	US assistant secretary of state (Richard) Boucher called me today when I sought FBI support for the investigations. I will also seek British support as the British envoy (in Dhaka) is expected to call on me, Hasina told the parliament this evening.        
	There is no scope to see it (rebellion) lightly, it was the outcome of a very well-designed plot, she added.        
	At the garrison, Hasina defended her decision to prevent the army from storming the besieged headquarters and the amnesty she offered to the rebels.         
	She said a military assault on the compound would have killed many more officers and their families who were being held hostage. We have thus saved many lives, she told army commanders at Senakunja, a meeting place in the Dhaka cantonment.        
	Her visit to the cantonment came a day after a military spokesperson claimed that the army was prepared to launch an immediate attack on the rebels, but the Prime Minister wanted a political solution.        
	Police today charged 1,000 Bangladesh Rifle border guards with murder, arson and rioting that left 148 people dead or missing, most of them army officers.        
	Among the detainees is BDR official Touhidul Alam, who led a rebel delegation to the Prime Minister hours after the violence erupted on Wednesday and later persuaded the mutineers to surrender arms.        
	Of a total of 181 officers, only 33 are known to have survived the carnage.        
	Six suspects        
	Six Bangladesh Rifles personnel have been identified by the police as the ringleaders of the 33-hour mutiny.        
	The six have been identified as deputy assistant directors Touhidul Alam, Jalil, Nasiruddin Khan and Mirza Mahbubur Rahman, and jawans Abdur Rahim and Selim, according to the Bangladesh media portal bdnews24.com.        
	The government also announced plans to form a special tribunal to try the mutineers.        
	Hundreds of border guards have started reporting back to their headquarters after the home ministry gave them a 24-hour ultimatum.        
	Some jawans said they were on leave or off duty during the mutiny. Some jawans also claimed they fled the compound after the violence started.        
	Why should I be afraid of returning to work? I was not involved in the incident. I left to go to my family outside after the shooting began, a guard said.         
	One of the survivors, Lt Col Mohammad Salam, said all BDR troops had not taken part. Some even sheltered and saved their officers, he said.

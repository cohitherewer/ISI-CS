The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Guards chief: US, Pak back anti-Iran rebels
                                                                                                               Guards chief: US, Pak back anti-Iran rebels
                              Mohammad Ali Jafari                            
	Tehran, Oct. 19 (Reuters): The head of Irans Revolutionary Guards vowed today to retaliate against the US and Britain after accusing them and Pakistan of backing militants who blew up six Guards commanders.        
	Iranian media say the Sunni insurgent group Jundollah (Gods soldiers) has claimed responsibility for yesterdays bombing in Sistan-Baluchestan province, which killed 42 people in all.         
	The incident threatened to overshadow talks between Iran and global powers in Vienna intended to tackle a standoff about Irans nuclear ambitions.         
	Guards commander-in-chief Mohammad Ali Jafari said Iranian security officials had presented documents indicating direct ties from Jundollah to US, British and, unfortunately, Pakistani intelligence organisations, the ISNA news agency said.        
	Behind this scene are the American and British intelligence apparatus, and there will have to be retaliatory measures to punish them, Jafari was quoted as saying.        
	Jundollah, which has been blamed for many attacks since 2005 in the desert province bordering Pakistan, says it is fighting to end discrimination against Sunnis by Irans dominant Shias. Its leader is Abdolmalek Rigi.        
	Jafari said Rigi and his plans were undoubtedly under the umbrella and the protection of US, British and Pakistani organisations, though he limited the threat of retaliation to the US and Britain.        
	Iranian television quoted General Mohammad Pakpour, commander of the Guards ground forces, whose deputy was killed in the bombing, as saying: The base of the terrorists and rebels has not been in Iran. They are trained by America and Britain in some of the neighbouring countries.        
	The US, Pakistan and Britain all condemned the bombing, the bloodiest attack in Iran since the 1980-88 war with Iraq. We reject in the strongest terms any assertion that this attack has anything to do with Britain, said a British spokeswoman. The bombing of a mosque in Zahedan, capital of Sistan-Baluchestan, reportedly claimed by Jundollah, killed 25 people in May.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Pope breaks wrist in fall
                                                                                                               Pope breaks wrist in fall
                              Minor surgery                            
	Aosta (Italy), July 17 (Reuters): Pope Benedict underwent minor surgery today after the 82-year-old Roman Catholic leader slipped in the bath and broke his wrist while on holiday in northern Italy.        
	The Vatican said the operation, the first time the pope had to be treated in hospital since his election in 2005, lasted 20 minutes under local anaesthesia and that the pope would have to wear a cast for about a month.        
	It was not immediately clear if there would be lasting damage that might affect the popes ability to play the piano. He is an accomplished pianist and usually relaxes in the evening by playing.        
	Patrizio Polisca, the popes personal doctor, stressed that the injury was caused by an accidental fall and that the pope was not feeling ill when he fell.

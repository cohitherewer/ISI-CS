The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Tsunami batters Pacific islands
                                                                                                               Tsunami batters Pacific islands
                      
	Apia (Samoa), Sept. 30 (AP): A massive tsunami unleashed by a powerful earthquake flattened Samoan villages and swept cars and people out to sea, killing at least 99 and leaving dozens missing today.        
	The death toll was expected to rise.        
	Survivors fled the fast-churning water for higher ground on the South Pacific islands and remained huddled there hours after the quake, with a magnitude between 8.0 and 8.3, struck around dawn yesterday.        
	The quake was centred about 193km south of the islands of Samoa, which has about 180,000 people, and American Samoa, a US territory of 65,000.        
	Four tsunami waves 4 to 6 metres high roared ashore on American Samoa, reaching up to 1.5km inland, Mike Reynolds, superintendent of the National Park of American Samoa, was quoted as saying by a parks service spokeswoman.        
	Less than 24 hours later, another strong underwater earthquake rocked western Indonesia today, briefly triggering a tsunami alert for countries along the Indian Ocean and sending panicked residents out of their houses. The quake toppled buildings, cut power and triggered a landslide on Sumatra island, and at least 13 people were reported killed.        
	The Samoan capital, Apia, was virtually deserted by afternoon, with schools and businesses closed. Hours after the waves struck, sirens rang out with another tsunami alert and scared residents headed for higher ground again, although there was no indication of a new quake.        
	In American Samoas capital of Pago Pago, the streets and fields were filled with ocean debris, mud, overturned cars and several boats as a massive clean-up effort continued into the night. Several buildings in the city  just a few feet above sea level  were flattened. Several areas were expected to be without power for up to a month.        
	In Washington, President Obama declared a major disaster for American Samoa. Obama said early today that he and his wife, Michelle, will keep those who have lost so much in our thoughts and prayers.        
	Hampered by power and communications outages, officials in the South Pacific islands struggled to determine damage and casualties. Samoan police commissioner Lilo Maiava said the police had confirmed 63 deaths but devastated areas were still being searched. At least 30 people were killed on American Samoa.

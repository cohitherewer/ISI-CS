The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Frantic civilians seek relief from clashes
                                                                                                               Frantic civilians seek relief from clashes

	Mingora (Pakistan), May 9 (AP): Civilians cowered in hospital beds today and refugees looted UN supplies  all of them desperate for relief from the fighting that has engulfed a northwestern valley as troops and warplanes try to drive out Taliban militants.        
	The Prime Minister, Yousaf Raza Gilani, directing millions of dollars to help the residents of a region where backing for the central government has sometimes been tenuous, described the offensive launched this week as a war of the countrys survival but said the military alone could not be victorious in the Swat Valley.        
	Further south, a suspected US missile strike killed nine people, mostly foreigners, in another militant stronghold near the Afghan border, officials said. The identities of the victims were not immediately unclear.        
	The army said it killed as many as 55 more Taliban fighters in Swat today.        
	Encouraged by the US, Pakistans leaders launched the full-scale offensive this week to halt the spread of Taliban control in districts within 10km of the capital.        
	Pakistans army is fighting to wrest Swat and neighbouring districts from militants who dominate the adjoining tribal belt along the Afghan frontier, where US officials say al Qaida chief Osama bin Laden is likely holed up.        
	But the fighting has caused the flight of hundreds of thousands of terrified residents. The government is appealing for international aid to ease the plight of the multitude of weary, traumatised people who have abandoned their homes in search of safety.        
	Witness accounts indicated that scores of civilians have already been killed or injured in the escalating clashes in Swat and the neighbouring Buner and Lower Dir districts.        
	Even the doctors are gone: Only three remained today at the hospital in Swats main town, Mingora  all of them working at full stretch.        
	Riaz Khan, a 36-year-old schoolteacher, his wife and two daughters occupied four of the beds, shrapnel wounds on their arms and their legs bandaged. Khan said his other two daughters were killed three days earlier when a mortar shell hit their home near Mingora. We buried our daughters on Thursday when the army relaxed the curfew, he told a reporter. We reached the hospital only with great difficulty.        
	Nisar Khan, one of the three doctors left, said about 25 war-wounded were among the 100 patients.        
	Taliban militants seized much of the area under a peace deal, even after the government agreed to their main demand to impose Islamic law in the region.        
	The army says it is reinforcing the 12,000 to 15,000 troops in Swat as they take on 4,000 to 5,000 militants.        
	Today, an AP reporter saw jet fighters flying over Mingora and later heard explosions from further up the valley. The military said its helicopter gunships attacked militant hideouts in Mingora and killed 15 fighters. An estimated 30 to 40 more died in smaller clashes elsewhere.         
	Mehsud warrant        
	An anti-terrorist court today issued a non-bailable arrest warrant for Taliban warlord Baitullah Mehsud. An anti-terrorist court in Lahore issued the warrant for Mehsud for involvement in a attack on a police training academy in March, officials said.

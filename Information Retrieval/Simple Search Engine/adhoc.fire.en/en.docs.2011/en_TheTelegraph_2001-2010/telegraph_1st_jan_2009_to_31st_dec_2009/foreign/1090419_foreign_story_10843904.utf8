	Lohan eyes Leo    
	 London, April 18 (PTI): After a messy break-up with DJ Smantha Ronson, actress Lindsay Lohan has turned her attention to men as she flirted with Leonardo DiCaprio.      
	The Mean Girls actress was seen flirting with a series of men on a night out before catching DiCaprio, the Sun online reported. DiCaprio is dating Israeli supermodel Bar Rafaeli. The 22-year-old actress began with a cosy chat and then surprised the Titanic star by dancing in front of him, at Hollywoods My House on Wednesday night.       
	As soon as Lindsay saw Leo she was like a bee to honey. She was going for the big catch and when she spotted him in a dark corner of the club she headed straight for him, a source said.

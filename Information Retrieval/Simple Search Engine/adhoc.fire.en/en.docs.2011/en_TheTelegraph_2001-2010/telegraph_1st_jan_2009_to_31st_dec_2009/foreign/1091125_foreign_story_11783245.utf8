	King Kong sold    
	 London, Nov. 24 (Reuters): The model used to film the final, climactic scenes of the 1933 film King Kong sold for 121,250 at an auction today.      
	Barely reconisable as the giant ape that terrorised New York as it scaled the Empire State Building, the metal model sold by Christies is just 22 inches high and consists of a collection of hinges and screws that were once covered in rabbit fur.      
	The model had been expected to fetch 150,000 pounds at the auction of film memorabilia in London.

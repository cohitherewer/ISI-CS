          CHRIS IRVINE                          Audited actor                                  
	London, Nov. 8: British actress Kate Winslet is worth 60 million to the British economy, according to the UK Film Council, after she became the first actor to be audited.        
	Winslet, 34, who won an Academy Award for Best Actress in February for her performance in The Reader, was chosen as a test case by the council as they attempt to place a monetary value upon Britains creative industries.        
	The formula to determine the artists worth was developed by David Steele, the head of research and statistics at the UK Film Council. It takes into account the stars salary as well as the production investment effect, in which the actors profile helps ensure the film is made in Britain. Other elements include the box-office chain effect, the tourism boost from the stars films and the general promotional effect for Britain. Winslets record salary for one film was around 6 million for Finding Neverland. The film council also credits her with about 34.4 million spent on her British movies.        
	The Winslet algorithm as it has been referred to, will be used by diplomats and businessmen promoting the British film industry abroad. When an actor achieves international prominence, they have a general effect of boosting their country of origin that works its way through television appearances, advertising and celebrity news, Steele said.

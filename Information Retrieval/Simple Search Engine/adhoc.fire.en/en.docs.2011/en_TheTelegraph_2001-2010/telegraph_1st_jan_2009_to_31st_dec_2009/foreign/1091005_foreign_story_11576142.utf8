The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | BBC show star calls celebrity a Paki
                                                                                                               BBC show star calls celebrity a Paki
          ANITA SINGH                                      Laila Rouass and partner Anton Du Beke on the BBC dance show Strictly Come Dancing      
	London, Oct. 4: Strictly Come Dancing star Anton Du Beke has escaped censure by the BBC for describing his celebrity partner as a Paki, despite Carol Thatcher being sacked for a similar offence.        
	Carol Thatcher is former British Prime Minister Margaret Thatchers daughter. Strictly Come Dancing is a BBC dance show.        
	Du Beke made the remark about the actress, Laila Rouass, who was born in London to a Morrocan father and an Indian mother, during rehearsals for the BBC One show. Rouass, who worked as a Channel V VJ in Mumbai and even acted in a Bollywood film, had been given a spray tan ahead of her television performance and Du Beke told her: Oh my God, you look like a Paki.        
	The 38-year-old actress was said to be gobsmacked by the comment, which was overheard by several members of the Strictly team.        
	Yesterday, Du Beke issued an apology. He said: I must say immediately and categorically that I am not a racist and that I do not use racist language. During the course of rehearsals Laila and I have exchanged a great deal of banter entirely in jest, and two weeks ago there was an occasion when this term was used between the two of us.        
	There was no racist intent whatsoever but I accept that it is a term which causes offence and I regret my use of it, which was done without thought or consideration of how others would react.                    THE SUNDAY TELEGRAPH

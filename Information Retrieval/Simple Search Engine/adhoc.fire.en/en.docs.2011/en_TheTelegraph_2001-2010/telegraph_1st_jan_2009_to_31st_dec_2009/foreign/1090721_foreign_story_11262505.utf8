The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Tapes revive Silvio scandal
                                                                                                               Tapes revive Silvio scandal
                            
	Rome, July 20 (Reuters): Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconis private life was back in the spotlight today when a leading news group posted audio tapes and transcripts of what it said were conversations with a female escort.        
	The new twist in the saga that has riveted many Italians for months appeared to end a short break from media scrutiny of his private life.        
	La Repubblica daily and LEspresso weekly websites posted tapes of conversations purportedly between Berlusconi and Patrizia DAddario, an escort who says she and others were paid to attend parties at Berlusconis residence in Rome.         
	Berlusconi has not denied that the woman went to his home but has said he did not know she was an escort.

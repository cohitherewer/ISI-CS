	Bimbo date    
	 London, March 20: Men would rather date a beautiful bimbo than a clever but much less attractive woman, a study has found, reports The Daily Telegraph.      
	The survey showed that 73 per cent of men are more likely to opt for a girl like Celebrity Big Brothers Chantelle Houghton than University Challenge star Gail Trimble. More than half of men said brains did not come into it as long as the girl is good looking because it was important to impress their friends.       
	Eight out of ten men said they would be intimidated by a clever girl. But almost three quarters of women said they would go for brains over good looks because handsome men are too vain and those with brains will be able to provide for them.

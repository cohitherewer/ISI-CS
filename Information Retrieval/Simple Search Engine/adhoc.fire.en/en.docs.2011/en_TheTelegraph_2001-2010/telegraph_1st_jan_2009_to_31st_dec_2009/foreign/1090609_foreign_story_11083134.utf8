                                                                                                               Brown quit calls increase
                            
	London, June 8 (Reuters): British Prime Minister Gordon Brown faced more calls to step down today after his Labour Party suffered a heavy defeat in European elections, taking its lowest share of a national vote since 1910.        
	Brown, who has vowed to stay on, will talk to Labour lawmakers to try to quell internal unrest  a growing number have urged him quit to give Labour a fighting chance at the next parliamentary election, due by June 2010.         
	The collapse in the Labour vote, which followed a dismal showing in local government elections last week, helped the far-Right British National Party win two seats in the European Parliament, the first time it has been represented there.        
	Labour won 15.7 per cent of the vote, behind the anti-EU UK Independence Party on 16.5 per cent and the Conservatives on 27.7. Labours vote was about seven points down from the 2004 European polls.

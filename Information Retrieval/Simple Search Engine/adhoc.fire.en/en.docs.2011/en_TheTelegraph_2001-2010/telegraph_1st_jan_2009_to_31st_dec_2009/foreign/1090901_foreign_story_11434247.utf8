The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | US feels outfoxed by wizard Karzai
                                                                                                               US feels outfoxed by wizard Karzai
          K.P. NAYAR                              
	Washington, Aug. 31: If Senator Edward Kennedys death last week had not consumed Americans, they would have been gripped by graphic accounts that are emerging from Kabul of sparks flying between an embattled Afghan President Hamid Karzai and the redoubtable US presidential envoy for Afghanistan and Pakistan, Richard Holbrooke, over another term in office for Karzai.         
	At one point the Afghan President whipped off his distinctive karakul sheepskin hat and slammed it onto the table where the two men were having dinner, a day after the disputed August 20 election, The Sunday Times of Britain reported.         
	It is a fascinating reversal of roles in Kabul from the time US Senator Joseph Biden, now vice-president, threw down his napkin 45 minutes into a dinner with Karzai last year and walked out of the presidential palace along with two other Senators after Karzai repeatedly told the Americans that there was no courruption in Afghanistan and that if there was any, it was not his fault.         
	The Obama administration wants a regime change in Kabul. The White House was hoping to bring it about through the current election.         
	But as results from across the country slowly trickle in and put Karzai closer each day to the magic 50 per cent of votes, Washington is finding itself outfoxed by the man Afghans call wizard for his deal-making skills in post-Taliban Afghanistan.         
	According to the tally that is out so far, Karzai has bagged about 47 per cent of votes against his nearest rivals almost 32 per cent.         
	Holbrookes eighth  and possibly the last  chance of winning the Nobel Peace Prize precariously hangs on forcing Karzai into a second round of voting with his nearest rival, former foreign minister Abdullah Abdullah and getting Abdullah to win that round.         
	Holbrooke was unsuccessfully nominated seven times for the Nobel as the chief architect of the 1995 Dayton Peace Agreement which ended the war in Bosnia.         
	But if Karzai is returned to power on September 17 when the final results of the Afghan elections are due, Washington  Holbrooke at any rate  will no longer be able to control the levers of power in Kabul.         
	Americas confusion over Afghanistan was apparent when US President Barack Obama praised the successful election in Afghanistan on August 20. The next day, he quickly moderated his praise for the process as an important step forward in the Afghan peoples effort to take control of their future and withheld endorsement of the election to await the official results from the Afghan Independent Electoral Commission and the Electoral Complaints Commission, the latter largely made up of people who will do the Obama administrations bidding.         
	Then Holbrooke got down to work on regime change in Kabul. His meeting with Karzai, marked by cold exchanges is said to have lasted merely 30 minutes, according to published accounts.         
	In contrast, the US envoy was closeted with Karzais main rival, Abdullah, for about three hours, after which, the media-savvy Abdullah, who first made his mark in the West as a mujahideen spokesman, came out with a dossier of complaints that the election was fraught with irregularities and malpractices.         
	General Stanley McChrystal, the US military commander in Afghanistan, was to have submitted a review of the security situation to the defence secretary, Robert Gates, a fortnight ago, but he has been asked delay it till the end of September.         
	Washington gravely miscalculated in picking its first choice as Karzais successor, former World Bank official Ashraf Ghani, an ethnic Pashtun, who was roundly rejected by Pashtuns in the election as an American plant.         
	The Obama administration may again be miscalculating in backing Abdullah and attempting to force Karzai into a second round of polling in the light of a web of alliances that the wizard President has weaved, cutting through tribal loyalties and support from warlords whose writ still runs across Afghanistan.         
	All of which is being watched in New Delhi, which has a stake in the eventual outcome of the voting process.         
	Meanwhile, Holbrooke is jetting off to Europe to persuade Americas British, French and German allies in the Afghan enterprise to see if they will cooperate with him in his effort to show Karzai his place in the Obama administrations scheme of things for Kabul.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Tiger air wing not a threat 
                                                                                                               Tiger air wing not a threat 
                            
	Colombo, Feb. 22 (Reuters): Sri Lanka said today the air wing of the Tamil Tigers no longer posed a threat after the last two rebel planes crashed during suicide raids on Friday.        
	One small aircraft slammed into the main government tax office in central Colombo late on Friday, killing at least two people and wounding 53, the military said.        
	The other was shot down and crashed in a marsh outside the international airport, the site of the Tiger air wings first strike in 2007. The attack had set off volleys of anti-aircraft fire across Colombo.        
	Authorities said the two planes were the last aircraft at the disposal of the LTTE.        
	It is a great victory in the fight against terrorism that we were able to bring down the two aircraft, defence spokesperson and minister Keheliya Rambukwella said.        
	Rambukwella said the rebels air force had been a threat to the entire region. Neighbouring India has nuclear facilities in its southern states.        
	In a news release yesterday, the rebels said the raid targeted the air force headquarters in Colombo and the airbase at the international airport.

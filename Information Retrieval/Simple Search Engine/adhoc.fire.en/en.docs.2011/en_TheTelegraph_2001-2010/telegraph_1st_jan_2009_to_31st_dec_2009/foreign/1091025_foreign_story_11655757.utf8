The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Pak army captures key Taliban town

	Islamabad, Oct. 24 (AP): Soldiers captured the strategically located hometown of Pakistans Taliban chief today after fierce fighting, officials said, the armys first major prize as it pushes deeper into a militant stronghold along the Afghan border.        
	 The battle for Kotkai town took several days and involved aerial bombardment as soldiers captured heights around the town. Army spokesman Major General Athar Abbas said troops were now ridding the town of land mines and roadside bombs planted by the insurgents.        
	Kotkai is symbolically important because it is the hometown of Pakistani Taliban chief Hakimullah Mehsud and one of his top deputies, Qari Hussain. It also lies along the way to the major militant base of Sararogha, making it a strategically helpful catch.        
	Thank God, this is the armys very big success, Abbas said. The good news is that (communications) intercepts show that there are differences forging among the Taliban ranks. Their aides are deserting them.        
	Pakistan is under intense international pressure to clear its tribal areas of insurgents, many of whom are blamed for attacks on US and Nato troops in Afghanistan. The government has pressed ahead in South Waziristan despite a wave of violence that has put the nation on edge. Bombings yesterday alone killed 24 people, including 17 headed to a wedding.        
	The army said today that three more soldiers had died, putting the armys death toll at 23, and 21 more militants had been killed, putting their overall death toll at 163. Access to the tribal belt is severely restricted, making independently verifying the armys information all but impossible.        
	The US has launched scores of missile strikes at militant targets in the tribal belt over the past year, killing several top militants including former Pakistani Taliban chief Baitullah Mehsud.        
	The latest strike hit Chuhatra village in the tribal region of Bajur, local government official Mohammad Jamil said. The missile hit a hide-out of the militants that included a tunnel.         
	The target appeared to be Faqir Mohammad, a prominent Taliban leader, but he is believed to have escaped, Jamil said.

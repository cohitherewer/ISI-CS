The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Taliban signals Swat truce extension
                                                                                                               Taliban signals Swat truce extension
                              A man injured in the blast is treated at a hospital in Dera Ismail Khan, Pakistan. (AP)                                  
	Maulana Sufi Mohammad, who forsook militancy when he was released last year, is seeking to persuade the Taliban to lower their guns and accept the governments offer to instate Islamic law across large tracts of the northwest, including Swat.        
	For all the talk of a rift between Sufi Mohammad and Maulana Fazlullah, who led a Taliban insurgency in Swat in late 2007, there was little sign of any dissonance when they met. Theres no difference, said Taliban spokesman Muslim Khan.        
	Hopefully, youll hear good news in one or two days, he added, referring to the chances of a ceasefire being extended beyond the middle of next week.        
	Critics in the West and in Pakistan fear the government had caved in to militants, and appeasement may result in Swat Valley becoming another safe haven for the Taliban and al Qaida. Pakistan fears that using force would fuel insurgencies spreading through the northwest.        
	The position of weakness that the government has negotiated from was demonstrated by its choice of peacemaker        
	Sufi Mohammad led a revolt in 1994 in an attempt to bring Islamic sharia law back to Swat, and went on to lead an army of thousands of tribesmen in a futile attempt to help Taliban and al Qaida fighters hold off US-led forces in 2001.        
	Yet Mohammad is seen as more amenable than Fazlullah, who emerged as the leader of the militants in Swat while the older man remained in prison for six years.        
	Arrested on his return after the ill-fated mission to Afghanistan, Mohammad was released last year in the hope that he could prevail over Fazlullah, who is also known as Mullah Radio because of his preaching jihad over illegal FM radio.        
	When the two met at the Taliban stronghold in Matta village outside Mingora, the main town in Swat, Fazlullah handed over a list of demands.        
	They met and discussed how peace will return here and what actions need to be taken for it, said Taliban spokesman Khan, adding that Mohammad was expected to make the Talibans case to the government. Taliban fighters now control most of the valley, just 130 km north of Islamabad. Between 250,000 and 500,000 people have fled Swat during that time.

	Washington, Jan. 23: Its not exactly Watergate but Barack Obamas inauguration was back in the dock today after it emerged that the quartet of classical musicians who ushered him onto the steps of the Capitol were faking it.         
	In a report headlined The Frigid Fingers Were Live, but the Music Wasnt, The New York Times said that the four, including the violinist Itzhak Perlman, had already recorded their contribution two days earlier and played along just for show.         
	A spokeswoman, told the newspaper that the musicians could not have played live in Tuesdays sub-zero temperatures because of the risk of broken piano strings and cracked instruments.

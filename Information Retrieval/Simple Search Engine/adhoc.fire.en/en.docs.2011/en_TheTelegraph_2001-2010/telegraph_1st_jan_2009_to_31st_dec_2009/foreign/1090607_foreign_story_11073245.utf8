The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Taliban clerics shot dead in Pak
                                                                                                               Taliban clerics shot dead in Pak
                              Amir Izzat Khan                            
	Islamabad, June 6 (Reuters): Two pro-Taliban clerics were killed in a shootout between security forces and militants in northwestern Pakistan today, the military said.        
	Government forces arrested the clerics on Thursday and were transporting them and other prisoners in a military convoy to the main northwestern city of Peshawar for interrogation. Militants first hit the convoy with a roadside bomb, then opened fire with assault rifles, triggering a shootout.        
	Both Amir Izzat Khan and Mohammad Alam were killed in this clash, military spokesman Athar Abbas told a news conference, referring to the clerics. One soldier was killed and five wounded in the skirmish.        
	The clash took place near Mardan on the main road leading to Swat Valley, where security forces launched a major operation last month to flush out militants.        
	Khan and Alam were close aides to Sufi Mohammad, a cleric who struck a peace deal with authorities in February to end violence in Swat. The pact collapsed after militants refused to lay down arms and began expanding their influence in nearby districts.        
	Abbas said 17 militants and three soldiers were killed in fighting in Swat in the last 24 hours and government forces had secured several more areas from the militants.        
	He said the security forces were expected to clear the main valley within days, but would need some more time to secure peripheral areas.        
	Abbas said 1,305 militants and 105 soldiers have been killed since the armys operation began. Militants have carried out nine reprisal bomb attacks in several cities and towns in recent weeks.        
	At least 40 people were killed and dozens were wounded when a suicide bomber blew himself during Friday prayers in a mosque in Upper Dir district, near Swat. On Thursday, militants shot dead five policemen after first targeting a convoy with a roadside bomb in Mardan.

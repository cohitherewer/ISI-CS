The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Sienna hates her GI doll
                                                                                                               Sienna hates her GI doll
                            
	London, July 22 (PTI): British beauty Sienna Miller is not impressed with the GI Joe action figure which was modelled on her.        
	 The 28-year-old actress who is playing femme fatale The Baroness in the upcoming film G.I. Joe: The Rise Of Cobra does not like the doll as it is cross eyed, reports The Sun.        
	My doll is cross-eyed and has the biggest chin you have ever seen. Action figures are always a bit off, arent they? Oddly enough from side on, it is definitely me but front on she looks sort of possessed, said Miller.        
	 The actress who is seen with a brunette hair do and wearing a black leather cat suit in the film had earlier said that the experience of donning the skin tight outfit was an unpleasant one.        
	I wont be wearing one again. Squeezing myself into that with the aid of talcum powder every day for five months was more than enough. I could barely move in it anyway, she said.

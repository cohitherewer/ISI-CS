The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | US, Russian satellites collide
                                                                                                               US, Russian satellites collide
  - Swarms of treacherous debris threaten orbiting space station        WILLIAM J. BROAD                          A Nasa picture of an Iridium satellite. (AP)                                        
	New York, Feb. 12: For decades, space experts have warned of orbits around the planet growing so crowded that two satellites might one day slam into one another, producing swarms of treacherous debris.        
	It happened on Tuesday.         
	The whirling fragments could pose a threat to the International Space Station, orbiting 346km up with three astronauts on board, though officials said the risk was now small. This is a first, unfortunately, Nicholas L. Johnson, chief scientist for orbital debris at the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (Nasa), said of the collision.        
	It happened some 788km above northern Siberia, at around noon Eastern time. Two communications satellites  one Russian, one American  cracked up in silent destruction. In the aftermath, military radars on the ground tracked large amounts of debris going into higher and lower orbits.        
	Nothing to this extent has ever happened before, Johnson said. Weve had three other accidental collisions between what we call catalogue objects, but they were all much smaller than this, the objects always very small and moderate in size.        
	The communication satellites, he added, are two relatively big objects.        
	The American satellite was an Iridium, one of a constellation of 66 spacecraft. Liz DeCastro, corporate communications director of Iridium Satellite, based in Bethesda, Maryland, said that the satellite weighed about 544kg and that its body was more than 3 metres long, not including large solar arrays.        
	In a statement, the company said that it had lost an operational satellite on Tuesday, apparently after it collided with a non-operational Russian satellite.        
	Although this event has minimal impact on Iridiums service, the statement added, the company is taking immediate action to address the loss. The companys hand-held phones can be used anywhere around the globe to give users voice and data communications. Johnson said the Russian satellite was presumably non-functional. Officials at the Russian embassy in Washington could not be reached for comment.         
	Johnson said the US militarys tracking radars had yet to determine the number of detectable fragments. Its going to take a while, he said. Its very, very difficult to discriminate all those objects when theyre really close together. And so over the next couple of days well have a much better understanding.        
	At a minimum, Johnson added: I think were talking many, many dozens, if not hundreds. The debris could threaten the space station and its astronaut crew, he said.

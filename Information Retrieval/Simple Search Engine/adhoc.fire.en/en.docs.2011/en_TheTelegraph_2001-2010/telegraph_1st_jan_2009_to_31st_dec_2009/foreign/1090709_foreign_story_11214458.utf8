                                                                                                               Chilli spray ends hostage standoff 
                            
	Habibganj (Bangladesh), July 8 (PTI): A suspected militant, armed with a crude bomb, was overpowered today with the help of chilli powder after he took two persons, including a boy, as hostage at a telecom office in Bangladesh.         
	The 35-year-old militant held out with the eight-year-old boy and an engineer at an office of the state-run Bangladesh Telecommunications Company Ltd for three hours.        
	The crisis ended after the Jamaat-ul-Mujahideen Bangladesh militant tried to flee by exploding bombs, forcing the police to fire gunshots.         
	The policemen sprayed chilli powder to overpower the militant when he tried to flee the scene exploding the (improvised) bombs, prompting us to fire gunshots, deputy inspector general of police of the northeastern Sylhet region Mosharraf Hossain Bhuiyan said.         
	Earlier, the police said the militant laid siege at the telecom office with a bomb wrapped around his chest.

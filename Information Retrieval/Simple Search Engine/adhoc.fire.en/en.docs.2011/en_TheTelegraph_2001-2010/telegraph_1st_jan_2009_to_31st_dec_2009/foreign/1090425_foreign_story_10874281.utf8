	Puttumatalan (Sri Lanka), April 24 (Reuters): The Sri Lankan government rejected a plan by UN secretary-general Ban Ki-Moon yesterday to send a humanitarian team to assess the condition of people trapped by the fighting.        
	The 58th Army Division commander, Brigadier Shavendra Silva, told reporters in Kilinochchi today that there would be no more breaks in fighting against the rebels. He said the only way civilians could leave the area was if the army rescued them.        
	In Colombo, two Indian envoys met Sri Lankas President today after demanding a truce in the closing chapter of a 25-year war which UN data showed had killed nearly 6,500 civilians in the last three months.        
	Lankan foreign secretary Palita Kohona told reporters a humanitarian mission was discussed some time ago, but now that there had been an exodus of people, there may be no need for it.         
	As these statements were made based on reports prior to the sudden influx of civilians from there, the need of the visit may not arise anymore, Kohona said. The military has cornered the separatists in less than 13 squarekm of the northeastern coastline, where the UN says 50,000 people are being held as human shields and suffering with little food, water or medical care.        
	The LTTE is firing artillery into their own area to make it look like the government is firing artillery, Silva said, adding that intelligence had intercepted LTTE leaders ordering fighters to trade their trademark tiger-stripe camouflage fatigues for civilian garb.        
	A few kilometres from the front, thousands of refugees languished in the blazing tropical sun awaiting transport away from the battlezone, where the army is trying to deal a death blow to the LTTE.        
	Explosions boomed and smoke billowed from the remaining battlefield, formerly an army-declared no-fire zone but now all that remains of the self-declared state the LTTE has fought since the early 1970s to create for Sri Lankas minority Tamils.        
	The military said more than 108,000 people had poured out of the war zone since Monday, when troops blasted through an earthen barrier the LTTE had built to block movement in or out of their dwindling territory.        
	The two Indian envoys, foreign secretary Shivshanker Menon and national security adviser M.K. Narayanan, told Lanka President Mahinda Rajapaksa that Colombo must halt its military action immediately, Indian home minister P. Chidambaram informed Tamil Nadu chief minister M. Karunanidhi today.        
	The envoys had told the President that it is no more a question of pleas or requests but India has insisted that the war should stop and the rehabilitation of civilians should start, Chidambaram told reporters after his 40-minute meeting with Karunanidhi. A statement issued by Narayanan said: We are hopeful of a positive outcome.        
	A UN working document, a copy of which was obtained by Reuters, says 6,432 civilians have been killed and 13,946 have been wounded in fighting since the end of January.         
	Journalists saw thousands of people in the coastal village of Puttumatalan during a military-chaperoned trip today.        
	Belongings were strewn all over the main A-35 road, discarded in the haste to escape the LTTE-held area. Soldiers gave people food and water, and a group of about 50 people bathed in a ditch. Speaking to scribes on a rare visit to the edge of the war zone, civilians told of Tamil Tiger rebels using them as human shields. Conditions were terrible as we did not have anything to eat. We thought its better to flee, quot; said Rajeshwarai, 40.

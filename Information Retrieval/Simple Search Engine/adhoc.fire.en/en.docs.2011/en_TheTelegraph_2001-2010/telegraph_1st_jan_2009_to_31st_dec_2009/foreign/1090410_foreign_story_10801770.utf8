	Islamabad, April 9 (AP): A hardline cleric, who negotiated a peace accord that halted fighting between the Taliban and security forces in the Swat Valley of northwest Pakistan, said today that he was leaving the region to protest the governments failure to impose Islamic law.        
	The announcement casts serious doubt on the durability of a ceasefire in the Swat Valley that US officials worry will create another sanctuary for allies of al Qaida, responsible for a rising tide of violence in Pakistan        
	The US embassy said heightened security was prompting it to suspend routine consular services tomorrow in Pakistans capital.         
	Spokesman Lou Fintor declined tonight to detail what led to the security concern in Islamabad, but said consulates in other major cities would remain open and that emergency services would still be available for Americans.        
	Imposing Islamic law in Swat, a one-time tourist haven, was the key plank of an accord worked out in February between the provincial government and Sufi Muhammad, a cleric who once led thousands to fight US forces in Afghanistan but has since renounced violence.        
	Thanks in part to Muhammads mediation, the agreement ended 18 months of terror and bloody clashes that had left hundreds dead and forced up to one-third of the previously prosperous valleys 1.5 million residents to flee. But the militants have retained their arms and this week pushed into a neighbouring area just 100km northwest of Islamabad, where they fought deadly gunbattles with villagers and police.         
	Muhammad, who had been camped out in the valleys main town of Mingora with hundreds of black-turbaned supporters, said they were leaving to protest Zardaris negative attitude. From now on, President Zardari will be responsible for any situation in Swat, the white-bearded cleric told reporters.         
	Quetta riots        
	Violence erupted in Quetta today after the discovery of the mutilated bodies of three missing political dissidents, with one police officer killed and 3 injured.

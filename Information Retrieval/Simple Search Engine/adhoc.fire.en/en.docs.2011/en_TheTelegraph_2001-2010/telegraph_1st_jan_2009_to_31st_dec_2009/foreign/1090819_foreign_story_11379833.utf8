                                                                                                               Begums battle over Khaleda birth date
                                (Top) Hasina and Khaleda                           
	Dhaka, Aug. 18 (AFP): The personal animosity between Bangladeshs rival political leaders has found a new focus in a row over Opposition chief Khaleda Zias date of birth.        
	Prime Minister Sheikh Hasinas ruling Awami League party has accused Zia of changing her birthday not out of vanity but out of spite.        
	The former Prime Minister celebrated her 65th birthday on Saturday. The date, August 15, is also the anniversary of the 1975 assassination of Hasinas father, Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, who led the country to independence from Pakistan in 1971.        
	Khaleda Zias educational certificate shows her birth date is September 5. Her marriage certificate shows she was born in late August. She changed the birthday to August 15 in the 1990s, health minister A.F.M. Ruhul Haque said. She did it deliberately to celebrate the killings of August 15, he said.        
	Sheikh Mujib was assassinated with 14 family members by a group of army officers. Hasina was abroad at the time. Altering ones date of birth is not unusual in Bangladesh.

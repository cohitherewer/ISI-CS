The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Police, protesters clash after Iran blast

	Tehran, June 20: Police officers used sticks and tear gas to force back thousands of demonstrators gathering in the capital today after Irans supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, said there would be bloodshed if street protests continued over the disputed presidential election.        
	State television reported that two people had been killed and eight wounded when a suicide bomber blew himself up at the Tehran shrine of Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini in the southern part of the city, several kilometres from the scheduled protests. The report of the blast could not be independently confirmed.         
	The violence unfolded on a day of extraordinary tension across Iran, as Opposition protesters swore to continue pressing their claims of a stolen election against Irans embattled and increasingly impatient clerical leadership.         
	According to a witness, defeated presidential candidate Mir Hossein Mousavi said in a public address in southwestern Tehran that he was ready for martyrdom. The witness said Mousavi anticipated action against him.        
	Irans divisions played out on the streets. Regular security forces stood back and calmly urged protesters to go home and avoid bloodshed, while the feared pro-government militia, the Basij, beat protesters with clubs and electric prods.         
	In some places, the protesters pushed back, rushing the militia in teams of hundreds, pitching at least three Basijis from their motorcycles and setting the vehicles on fire.         
	The protesters included many women, who even berated as cowards men who fled the Basijis. In all, there seemed some restraint on both sides. While there appeared to be tens of thousands of protesters, the number was far smaller than in the mass demonstrations earlier this week.         
	And while the police fired shots, there were no initial reports of any dead. A BBC journalist at Revolution Square, however, reported seeing one person shot by security forces.        
	If they open fire on people and if there is bloodshed, people will get angrier, said one protester, Ali, 40. They are out of their minds if they think with bloodshed they can crush the movement.        
	There had been varying reports in the hours leading up to the rally about whether it would be called off in the face of the states threatened crackdown. In the morning, black-clad security forces lined the streets of two squares in central Tehran as the city braced itself for a violent crackdown, witnesses said. State television reported that Moussavi, had called off the protest, but some of his supporters, posting on social networking sites, urged demonstrators to gather.        
	But websites of two Opposition figures declared the rally would be held. The website of Mehdi Karroubi, another presidential candidate who accused the government of fraud, said that contrary to reports on state media, the protests would go on and added that Karroubi, the brave cleric, will join the rally along with Mousavi.         
	On Moussavis website, a letter was posted from the Islamic Human Rights Group complaining of abuses by pro-government militia, which it said had attacked crowds.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | 8 charged in plot to bomb UK flights
                                                                                                               8 charged in plot to bomb UK flights
          AMIT ROY                              
	London, Feb. 17: Eight would be suicide bombers were caught when they were almost ready to blow up several transatlantic aircraft simultaneously in a conspiracy directed from Pakistan, Woolwich Crown Court was told today in a trial expected to last 10 months.        
	 The plan was to use liquid explosives smuggled on board disguised as soft drinks, the court heard.        
	It is the Crowns case that this plot was being directed from Pakistan, stated Peter Wright, who is leading the prosecution. All eight men deny conspiracy to murder in the alleged plot that counter-terrorist police say was foiled in August 2006.        
	 Wright said while some defendants were simply foot soldiers, the planning and research was the responsibility of others, both in Britain and Pakistan.        
	 In the dock are: Abdulla Ahmed Ali, aka Ahmed Ali Khan, 28, of Prospect Hill, Walthamstow, London; Assad Sarwar, 28, of Walton Drive, High Wycombe; Tanvir Hussain, 27, of Nottingham Road, Leyton, east London; Ibrahim Savant, 28, of Denver Road, Stoke Newington, north London; Arafat Waheed Khan, 27, of Farnan Avenue, Walthamstow, London; Waheed Zaman, 24, of Queens Road, Walthamstow, London; Umar Islam, aka Brian Young, 30, of Bushey Road, Plaistow, east London; and Donald Stewart-Whyte, 22, of Hepplewhite Close, High Wycombe.        
	 The ringleaders of the deadly Islamic fundamentalist conspiracy were Abdulla Ahmed Ali and Assad Sarwar, according to the prosecution. They shared an interest that involved inflicting heavy casualties upon an unwitting civilian population all in the name of Islam. The means by which they intended to inflict heavy casualties on ordinary civilians was by the carrying out of a series of co-ordinated and deadly explosions.        
	 In the UK Ali and Sarwar were the men with the principal responsibility for achieving this goal.        
	 You may conclude on the evidence you hear that these men had a great deal to discuss, and that the nature of the contact between them and Pakistan during this time militates against it being for any social purpose, Wright told the jury.        
	 He said the bombs were to be made from everyday household items that could be smuggled on board and detonated in mid-flight.        
	 His case was: The component parts of these improvised devices would be designed to resemble soft drinks bottles and their contents, batteries and other seemingly innocuous items that were to be carried on board the aircraft disguised as part of their hand luggage. Once assembled, these items would have the capacity of being detonated with devastating consequences.        
	 He explained: quot;The devices were to be smuggled on to the aircraft and were to be detonated in flight by suicide bombers prepared to lose their lives in this way. Inevitably such an event would have fatal consequences for the various passengers and crew who happened, quite by chance, to be flying to North America on the day selected by them to commit this atrocity.        
	 He warned: Had this plot not been frustrated by the timely arrest of these men, the disaster they contemplated was not far off. They were prepared to strike a blow in which they would lose their lives but it was a blow that would reverberate across the globe.        
	 A computer memory stick containing details of flights from Heathrow to various North American destinations was found in Alis pocket. Seven services were highlighted, all leaving from Terminal 3 at Heathrow and all due to be mid-flight at the same time. According to the prosecution, the planes were travelling from London to Montreal and Toronto in Canada and San Francisco, Washington, Chicago and New York in the US.        
	 Wright commented: The highlighting of these daily flights does not appear to have been accident or coincidence. quot;         
	 And he went on: quot;It is the Crowns case that these men and others were actively engaged in a most deadly plot designed to bring about what would have been, had they been successful, a civilian death toll from an act of terrorism on an almost unprecedented scale. quot;

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | PM cautions against hang-the-bank syndrome
                                                                                                               PM cautions against hang-the-bank syndrome
          AMIT ROY                              
	London, April 2: Even before his formal meeting today with Barack Obama, Manmohan Singh had a useful 10-minute chat with the US President at Buckingham Palace last night.        
	 In fact, it was Obama who approached the Indian Prime Minister, who, as a former Reserve Bank of India governor, senior World Bank director, former Indian finance minister under Narasimha Rao, is the ranking economist among the G20 leaders.        
	 Officials pointed out that this was the first face to face interaction between the two leaders. Among those who sought him out were President Jintao of China, King Abdullah of Saudi Arabia, President Medvedev of Russia, President Sarkozy of France, President Lula of Brazil, Prime Minister Taro Aso of Japan, Prime Minister Han Seung-soo of South Korea and Prime Minister Abhisit Vejjajiva of Thailand, all of whom were at Buckingham Palace.        
	 And last night at the dinner hosted by Gordon Brown, the British Prime Minister, Singh gave what can only be described as an in-depth professorial lecture. The only point to note is that the downturn is much deeper than we thought when we met in Washington D.C. in November last year, and the prospects of a recovery have receded to 2010 at best, he began. This is the worst recession in sixty years. The pain is being felt both in industrialised countries and in developing countries.        
	He appeared to bridge the gap between those who want their governments to spend even more money on fiscal stimuli and the others who want stricter regulation of banks. There can be no doubt that restoration of the banking system in the industrialised countries to full functionality is a precondition for successful revival of the global economy, said Singh. This is primarily a task for the governments of the individual countries concerned.        
	 Then he placated the opposite lobby: It is a task that will require commitment of resources on an unprecedented scale. The IMF has estimated that the write down of toxic assets needed may be as high as $2.8 trillion in the US and $1.4 trillion in Europe and Japan. Many governments, most recently the United States, have made large commitments of resources to deal with the problem of tainted assets and also to recapitalize the banking system. More may well be needed.         
	 He made an interesting diversion when he suggested the hang the bankers movement, though understandable, was going off on the wrong track. Running a coalition in India appears to have prepared him to play the role of peacemaker between the Americans and the British on one hand and the French and the Germans on the other.        
	 A rescue effort on this scale will place a huge burden on tax payers and this has given rise to considerable public anger, which is entirely understandable, he pointed out gently. However, it has to be explained to tax payers, and also their elected representatives, that anger at the irresponsible, and even morally reprehensible, behaviour on the part of managements of financial institutions, should not come in the way of efforts to resurrect the system.        
	 He said possibly to those who trashed the Royal bank of Scotland office in the City and want a banker hanging from every lamp post in the Square Mile: We have to explain to the public that reviving the banks is important not for the banks, as is sometimes perceived by the public, but for the economy, for employment, and for global prosperity generally.        
	 He spoke of the role of the IMF: The International Monetary Fund had estimated that a discretionary fiscal stimulus of about 2 percent of GDP in 2009 would be needed, in addition to the operation of automatic stabilisers. This was to be followed by a similar order of stimulus in 2010 to achieve the objective of moving from an unavoidable decline of around 1 per cent in 2009 to a modest positive growth of about 2 per cent in 2010. Many observers have also commented that the modest global recovery projected for 2010 may be over optimistic. I recognise that there are time lags in the system and the effects of actions already taken may be felt only in the coming months, but it does seem that the risks lie in doing too little rather than too much, and we are not doing enough to ensure recovery in 2010.        
	 His message to voters in India was mixed: We in India have been fortunate in having weathered the global downturn better than many others. Our growth rate, which was close to 9 per cent in the previous 5 years, will fall below 7 per cent in 2008-09.        
	This is perhaps the first time it has been acknowledged that the GDP growth rate will fall below (italics) 7 per cent  todays Financial Times, incidentally, put the figure for this year at 4.3 per cent.        
	 He went on: Like other countries, we have made aggressive use of both monetary and fiscal policy, with a total fiscal stimulus or expansion of the fiscal deficit above the planned level of almost 4 percentage points of GDP in 2008-09. We hope to be able to achieve a similar growth rate in 2009-10, with continuing reliance on monetary and fiscal policy. Effective regulation of the banking system has gained us much more than any additional strain imposed by temporary fiscal expansion. Besides, since most of the fiscal stimulus will be directed to increased investment in infrastructure, it will in the medium term contribute to growth and thus help reduce the debt ratio automatically.        
	 He had a word, too, for the poor of Africa and elsewhere: While India will be able to manage, may other developing countries may not be in the same position and this is where the international community can help. We must ensure that countries hurt by the massive withdrawal of private capital that has taken place, which is unlikely to be reversed in 2010, are able to rely upon an increased flow of resources from the international financial institutions. This will help these countries to maintain a higher level of demand than would otherwise be possible and thus help global revival.

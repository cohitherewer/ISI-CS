The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | God has done justice: Hasina
                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      God has done justice: Hasina
                          Sheikh Hasina                    
	Dhaka, Nov. 22 (PTI): Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina termed the Supreme Court verdict on her father Sheikh Mujibur Rahmans killers as a triumph of truth and justice and said she had kept faith that God would ensure eventual justice all through the 34 years since the tragedy.        
	In her first public comments after the apex court upheld the death sentence for the soldiers who assassinated Mujib in a military coup in 1975, Hasina said the killers had forgotten that there was a judge above all.        
	It has been proved through the judgment that anyone committing crimes will get punished... It is a triumph of truth and justice, the Prime Minister said at an armed forces day reception last evening at Dhaka cantonment.        
	Hasina, who lost most of her family members in the military coup, said the country had seen a misleading campaign to glorify the killings.        
	She said the subsequent governments rewarded the killers, who used to say, I killed Sheikh Mujib, dare you try me.        
	The killers had forgotten, a judge is there above all, who sees everything... I kept trust in almighty Allah who has ensured eventual justice, Hasina said.        
	Mujib, who led Bangladesh to independence in 1971, was gunned down at his home in the Dhanmandi area, along with his wife and three sons in a coup on August 15, 1975. Hasina was abroad at the time.

	Cindy mole    
	 London, Oct. 18 (PTI): Supermodel Cindy Crawford fears that the famous mole on her face may turn cancerous.      
	The 43-year-old gets her mole checked every year for cancer, the Daily Mail has reported.      
	At the start of Crawfords career in the late 1980s it was little more than a freckle but it has grown and now protrudes above the surface of the skin.      
	Its not something I really like to talk about. But I do now get this checked out every year as a matter of course, she said.    
	Butler pals     
	 London (PTI): Gerard Butler has said that he enjoys sitting at home with friends rather than attending a glitzy showbiz bash. I just like to go back home and chill out with my friends. It sounds really boring but its true, the actor said.

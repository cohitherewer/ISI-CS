	Los Angeles, July 18 (PTI): A new song of Michael Jackson titled A Place with No Name was unveiled on a celebrity news website.        
	TMZ.com is carrying a snippet of the song whose lyrics and the tune are similar to the 1971 hit ballad A Horse with No Name by the group America. However, the website stated that it was unclear when the song was recorded.        
	The band was honoured that Michael chose to do their song and they hope it becomes available for all Michaels fans to hear, Jim Morey, Americas current manager, said. Morey was also Jacksons manager in the late 1980s and early 1990s.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Microsoft offers two browsers to Europe
                                                                                                               Microsoft offers two browsers to Europe

	Berlin, July 25: Microsoft has offered to give European computer users a choice of web browsers, an unprecedented move that the company hopes will avert another anti-trust conviction and big fine.        
	Microsoft said users of new computers running Windows 7 in Europe would get a ballot screen that would let them easily download other browsers from the Internet and turn off Microsofts default Internet Explorer.         
	If European officials approve the proposal and drop their anti-trust case against Microsoft, the version of Windows 7 with the ballot screen could be available in Europe shortly after the official release of the software on October 22, the companys general counsel, Bradford L. Smith, said in an interview.         
	The European Commission, the EUs executive body, said in a statement released in Brussels that it welcomes this proposal and will now investigate the practical effectiveness in terms of ensuring genuine consumer choice.         
	The offer by Microsoft, which a decade earlier had fought attempts to open Windows to another competing browser, Netscape, represents an unprecedented concession in its latest anti-trust clash with European regulators.        
	Smith said the concessions had the potential to settle the latest European case. This is an important step forward and follows extensive and lengthy discussion between Microsoft and the commission. But until the commission approves something, nothing is really done.         
	Given the state of the economy, we believed it was very important to move forward quickly, he said.        
	This would mark a big step forward in addressing a decade of legal issues, the company said in its statement.

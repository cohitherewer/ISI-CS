	Kate kiss auction    
	 London, Mar 21 (PTI): Supermodel Kate Moss has proved that she is ready to go the extra mile for the sake of charity and has auctioned off a kiss, raising 5,000 from one lucky banker who won the bid.       
	The 35-year-old British supermodel has promised that she will go to the winners office and will kiss him in front of all his colleagues, the Daily Mirror website (www. mirror.co.uk) said.      
	Moss was attending the Mummy Rocks fundraiser for Great Ormond Street Childrens Hospital when she announced her decision.       
	A guest at the event told the tabloid: Kate was in cracking form and desperate to raise as much money as possible. Other celebs had donated prizes so Kate wanted to really raise the bar. She agreed to become a kissogram for a day and to visit whoever bid the most in his office and give him a kiss. But the supermodel was quick to point out that it will be a tame affair, in a bid to appease boyfriend Jamie Hince who did not look pleased.

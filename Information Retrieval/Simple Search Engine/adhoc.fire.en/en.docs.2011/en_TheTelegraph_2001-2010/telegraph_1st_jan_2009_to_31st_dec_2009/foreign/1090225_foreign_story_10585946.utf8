	Divorce hurts planet     
	 Canberra, Feb. 24 (Reuters): Staying married is better for the planet because divorce leads the newly single to live more wasteful lifestyles, an Australian lawmaker said today.      
	Senator Steve Fielding told a Senate hearing in Canberra that divorce only made climate change worse. When couples separated, they needed more rooms, more electricity and more water. This increased their carbon footprint, Fielding said. We understand that there is a social problem (with divorce), but now were seeing there is also environmental impact as well on the footprint.

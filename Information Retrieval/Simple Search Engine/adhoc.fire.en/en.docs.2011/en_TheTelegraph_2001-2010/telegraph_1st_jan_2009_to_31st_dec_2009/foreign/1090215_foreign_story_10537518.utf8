The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | New limits placed on Wall Street bonuses
                                                                                                               New limits placed on Wall Street bonuses

	Washington, Feb. 14: A provision buried deep inside the $787 billion economic stimulus bill would impose restrictions on executive bonuses at financial institutions that are much tougher than those proposed 10 days ago by the treasury department.        
	The provision, inserted by Senate Democrats over the objections of the Obama administration, is aimed at companies that have received financial bailout funds.         
	It would prohibit cash bonuses and almost all other incentive compensation for the five most senior officers and the 20 highest-paid executives at large companies that receive money under the treasurys Troubled Asset Relief Programme, or Tarp. The stimulus package was approved by the House on Friday, then by the Senate in the late evening.        
	The pay restrictions resemble those that the treasury department announced this month, but are likely to ensnare more executives at many more companies and also to cut more deeply into the bonuses that often account for the bulk of annual pay.        
	The restriction with the most bite would bar top executives from receiving bonuses exceeding one-third of their annual pay.         
	Any bonus would have to be in the form of long-term incentives, like restricted stock, which could not be cashed out until the Tarp money was repaid in full.        
	The provision, written by Senator Christopher J. Dodd, Democrat of Connecticut, highlighted the growing wrath among lawmakers and voters over the lavish compensation that top Wall Street firms and big banks awarded to senior executives at the same time that many of the companies, teetering on the brink of insolvency, received taxpayer-paid bailouts.        
	The decisions of certain Wall Street executives to enrich themselves at the expense of taxpayers have seriously undermined public confidence, Dodd said on Friday. These tough new rules will help ensure that taxpayer dollars no longer effectively subsidise lavish Wall Street bonuses.        
	Top economic advisers to President Obama adamantly opposed the pay restrictions, according to Congressional officials, warning lawmakers behind closed doors that they went too far and would cause a brain drain in the financial industry during an acute crisis.         
	Another worry is the tougher restrictions may encourage executives to more quickly pay back the governments investments since, in a compromise with the financial industry, banks no longer have to replace federal funds with private capital. That could remove an extra capital cushion, further reducing lending.        
	The legislatively imposed pay curbs are, in essence, a bad report card for the treasury secretary, Timothy F. Geithner, for failing to be tough enough on companies getting bailout money.

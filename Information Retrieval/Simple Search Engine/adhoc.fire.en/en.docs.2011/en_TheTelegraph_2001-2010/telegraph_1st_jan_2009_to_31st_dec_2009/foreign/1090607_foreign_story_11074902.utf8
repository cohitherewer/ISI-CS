                                                                                                               Ban calls for Lanka probe
                            
	United Nations, June 6 (Reuters): Any credible accusation of human rights violations committed during the final bloody phase of Sri Lankas war against Tamil Tiger separatists should be investigated, UN secretary-general Ban Ki-moon said yesterday.        
	Id like to ask the Sri Lankan government to recognise the international call for accountability and full transparency, Ban told reporters after he briefed the UN Security Council on a trip to Sri Lanka where he visited refugee camps.        
	Whenever and wherever there are credible allegations for the violations of international humanitarian law there should be a proper investigation, he said.

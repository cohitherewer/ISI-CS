	Dhaka, May 14 (AP): Police said today they arrested 526 border guards from across Bangladesh for suspected involvement in a mutiny over pay and working conditions that left more than 70 people dead three months ago.        
	 About 100 suspected mutineers were arrested yesterday and 426 today, police officials involved in the crackdown said. The officials, who declined to provide further details, cannot be identified because they were not authorised to speak to the media.        
	Authorities say more than 800 suspected mutineers were earlier arrested and jailed pending trial. Many others reportedly went into hiding. The mutiny ended through negotiations, with offers of an amnesty.

	Kathmandu, May 6 (PTI): Maoist chief Pushpa Kamal Dahal, alias Prachanda, today tried to mend fences with his estranged ally, the CPN-UML.        
	However, he made it clear that his party would not tolerate any interference in the countrys internal affairs.         
	Denying that he had named India as one of the interfering forces, Prachanda said: We will never tolerate any kind of interference into the internal affairs of Nepal from any part of the world.        
	He said the people of Nepal felt that Indias role in the army chief issue was not positive.         
	Prachanda quit as Prime Minister on Monday because President Ram Baran Yadav had stopped him from removing army chief, General Rukmagat Katuwal.        
	Prachanda today drove to the residence of CPN-UML leader Jhalanath Khanal for talks with the party that had withdrawn support to the Maoist-led government.        
	We have agreed that all political parties should move unitedly to draft the Constitution on time and take the peace process ahead, Khanal said.        
	The President has called political parties to form a government of consensus by Saturday.         
	However, on the streets of Kathmandu today, police clashed with protesting Maoists, who vowed to prevent a new government from being formed unless Yadav supported Katuwals firing.         
	Police used tear gas and bamboo batons to break up the protest. No one was seriously injured. Authorities have imposed a ban on protests in key areas of Kathmandu this week.        
	On the video showing him bragging about the strength of the Peoples Liberation Army, Prachanda said the tape was no longer relevant as it was made more than 18 months ago.         
	I had referred to several issues which were relevant then amidst the uncertainty of the Constituent Assembly elections, he said.

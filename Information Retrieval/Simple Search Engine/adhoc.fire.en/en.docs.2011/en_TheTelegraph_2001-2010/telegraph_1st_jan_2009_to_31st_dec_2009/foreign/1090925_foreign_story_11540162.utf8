	London, Sept. 24: The largest hoard of Anglo-Saxon gold, consisting of about 1,500 items and dating back to between 675AD and 725AD, has been found by an unemployed 55-year-old man pottering around on a farm in Staffordshire with a 14-year-old metal detector.        
	In archaeological and historical terms, the find, officially declared today to be a national treasure, is considered one of the most significant ever made in the UK.        
	Wandering around with a metal detector is an eccentric British hobby but Terry Herbert, who made his discovery on the afternoon of July 5, said that in the opinion of one expert, it was like finding Tutankhamens tomb.        
	Herbert, who then spent five days rummaging through the soil and now admits he sees gold in his dreams, added: I just flushed all over when he said that. The hairs on the back of my neck stood up. I was excited when I started digging up the gold but it was frightening in the end.        
	Once a valuation and sale have been completed, the market value of the find will go to Herbert and the owner of the farmland who have agreed to split the proceeds which are expected to exceed a seven figure sum. Its been more fun than winning the lottery, commented Herbert.        
	A total of 1,345 items have been examined by experts, although the list includes 56 clods of earth which have been X-rayed and contain further metal artefacts. There are, at least, 650 items of gold in the haul, weighing more than 5kg, and 530 silver objects totalling more than 1kg. Much of it appears taken from weaponry.        
	The highlights include sword hilt fittings, whose elaborate and expensive decoration  many are made of gold and inlaid with garnets  suggest the weapons were once the property of the highest echelons of nobility.         
	There are also folded crosses, portions of helmets, and a strip of gold bearing a biblical inscription in Latin. The translation reads: Rise up, Lord, and may thy enemies be dispersed and those who hate thee be driven from thy face.

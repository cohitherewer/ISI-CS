	Los Angeles, July 1 (AP): Michael Jacksons 7-year-old will was filed today in a Los Angeles court, giving his entire estate to a family trust and naming his mother as a beneficiary of the trust and the guardian of his three children.        
	The will names singer Diana Ross, a life-long friend of Jackson, as a successor guardian to 79-year-old Katherine Jackson if necessary.        
	The will, dated July 7, 2002, estimated his estate at that time at more than $500 million. It gives the entire estate to the Michael Jackson Family Trust. His former wife Debbie Rowe is cut out of the will.        
	Meanwhile, a person familiar with the situation said no public Jackson memorial was planned for his sprawling Neverland ranch.        
	Santa Barbara officials had discussed the possibility a memorial or public viewing could occur tomorrow. But the person, said nothing was planned for Neverland. The source said it appears more likely a funeral and burial will take place in Los Angeles. The family has the final say. The person said billionaire Thomas Barrack, who owns Neverland in a joint venture with Jackson, sought an exemption to bury the singer.

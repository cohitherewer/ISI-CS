	Jolie kid fuss    
	London, July 27 (PTI): Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolies daughter Shiloh is obsessed with clothes and refuses to remove those that fascinate her.      
	The three-year-old, who is the couples eldest biological child, is currently enamoured by a pair of old soccer boots handed down to her from Maddox, the seven-year-old adopted by Jolie from Cambodia.       
	She is regularly spotted in the shoes and even wears them to her ballet and tap dancing lessons. Earlier, the toddler had taken to a ballet tutu and worn it for months.     
	JLo Idol    
	Los Angeles (PTI): Singer-actress Jennifer Lopez has denied reports that she was in the run to replace American Idol judge Paula Abdul. Abdul had not signed a contract with the Idol producers to return for season 8 of the hit singing competition, fuelling reports that Lopez was to replace her, reports People magazine. But a spokesman for Lopez said: The rumour of Jennifer Lopez throwing herself in the ring to take over for Paula Abdul is completely false.

	Caring Carla    
	 Paris: A tramp who lives in the street near Carla Bruni-Sarkozys luxury town house says she regularly hands him over 50 and 100 euro notes and even offered to put him up in a hotel, reports The Daily Telegraph. The French First Lady, who lives in the chic 16th district when not at the Elyse palace, struck up a conversation with Denis, 53, after passing him every day on her school run with her son, Aurlien, eight. She asks after me, she gives me one or two 50 or 100 euro notes, Denis said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Novice Democrats ride Japan wave 
                                                                                                               Novice Democrats ride Japan wave 
                              Yukio Hatoyama                            
	Tokyo, Aug. 30 (Reuters): Japanese voters swept the Opposition to a historic victory in an election today, ousting the long-ruling conservative party and handing the novice Democrats the job of reviving a struggling economy.        
	The win by the Democratic Party of Japan (DPJ) ends a half-century of almost unbroken rule by the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) and breaks a deadlock in the parliament, ushering in a government that has promised to focus spending on consumers, cut wasteful budget outlays and reduce the power of bureaucrats.        
	But the untested party will have to move quickly to keep support among voters worried about a record jobless rate and a rapidly ageing society that is inflating social security costs.        
	The people are angry with politics and the ruling coalition. We felt a great sense of people wanting change for their livelihoods and we fought this election for a change in government, said Opposition DPJ leader Yukio Hatoyama, 62.        
	Hatoyama is expected to name a transition team tomorrow to prepare to take power.        
	Media projections showed the DPJ set for a landslide win, possibly taking two-thirds of the seats in the parliaments powerful 480-member lower house. That matched earlier forecasts of a drubbing for Prime Minister Taro Asos LDP.        
	The ruling partys loss ended a partnership between the LDP, big business and bureaucrats that turned Japan into an economic juggernaut after the countrys defeat in World War II. That strategy foundered when Japans bubble economy burst in the late 1980s. Growth has stagnated since.        
	 Aso said he took responsibility for the defeat, adding an LDP leadership race to pick a successor should be held soon.        
	Japanese news agency Jiji said the LDPs performance was the partys worst since its founding in 1955.

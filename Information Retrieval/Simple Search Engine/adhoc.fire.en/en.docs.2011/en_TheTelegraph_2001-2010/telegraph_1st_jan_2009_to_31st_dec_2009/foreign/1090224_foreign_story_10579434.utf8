The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Sabyas dual Kodak moment
                                                                                                               Sabyas dual Kodak moment

	Calcutta, Feb. 23: Calcutta had its own Kodak moment at the 81st Annual Academy Awards. Twice. And they are both accredited to citys design doyen Sabyasachi Mukherjee.         
	While all eyes were on A.R. Rahman as he accepted his two Oscars for the night for best original score and best original song, Sabya was in seventh heaven.         
	As a proud Indian, he witnessed a historic moment. But for Sabya, the occasion was doubly special. The black sherwani that Rahman wore was his Bridal Sutra design.         
	This has been my best birthday ever. I was very keen that Rahman wear something Indian and I had told his stylist that if it is not mine it doesnt matter, it has to be Indian.         
	He is such a genius that he doesnt need to conform to other peoples clothes. The world needs to conform to his kind of music, Sabya told The Telegraph. The designer was also proud of his second Oscar creation worn by Rahmans wife Saira. I was very happy that she wore it exactly the way it was meant to be worn. She didnt feel pressurised to change her style.

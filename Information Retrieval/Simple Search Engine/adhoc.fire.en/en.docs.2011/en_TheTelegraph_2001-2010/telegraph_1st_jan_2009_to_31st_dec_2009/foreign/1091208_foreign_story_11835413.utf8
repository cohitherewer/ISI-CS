	Tehran, Dec. 7 (Reuters): Iranian police clashed in Tehran today with Opposition demonstrators seeking to renew their challenge to the government six months after a disputed presidential election, witnesses said.        
	Police fired tear gas at supporters of Opposition leader Mir Hossein Mousavi when a state rally marking the killing of three students under the former Shah turned violent.        
	I saw at least 10 people being arrested and taken to minibuses, said one witness.        
	Authorities shut down the mobile phone network in central Tehran to stop Opposition protesters from contacting each other, the reformist website Rah-e Sabz said. At least two women supporters of Mousavi were among those arrested, it said.        
	The June 12 presidential election, which secured President Mahmoud Ahmadinejads re-election, sparked Irans worst unrest since the Islamic revolution three decades ago and exposed deep divisions in the establishment. Authorities deny allegations of vote-rigging.        
	Security measures taken by the authorities on Student Day displayed their determination to uproot the opposition movement, which Mousavi said yesterday would continue despite pressure.        
	Witnesses told Reuters police fired tear gas and clashed with protesters in various Tehran squares to disperse them.         
	Police fired tear gas at demonstrators in Vali-ye Asr Square ... they are clashing with protesters, said a witness.

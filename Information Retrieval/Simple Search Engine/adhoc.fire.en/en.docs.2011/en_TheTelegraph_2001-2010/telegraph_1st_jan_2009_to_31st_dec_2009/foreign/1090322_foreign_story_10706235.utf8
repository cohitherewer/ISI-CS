The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Parents fail to keep baby alive
                                                                                                               Parents fail to keep baby alive
                            
	London, March 21 (Reuters): A nine-month old baby with an exceptionally rare medical condition died in a British hospital today after his parents lost a legal battle to force doctors to keep treating him.        
	Two court of appeal judges had refused the parents permission to challenge a ruling which gave the hospital treating the boy, named as OT, the right to take him off the ventilator that was keeping him alive.        
	The boy died this morning, surrounded by his parents and family, after treatment was withdrawn, the Press Association reported. During his short time with us OT became the focus of our lives, the babys parents said in a statement.

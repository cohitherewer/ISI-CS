                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      BA, union agree to urgent talks
                            
	London, Dec. 16 (AP): British Airways PLC and union leaders agreed to meet for emergency talks as the airline attempts to avert a 12-day strike by cabin crew staff over Christmas.        
	BA is still pushing ahead with an emergency application for a court injunction to prevent the walkout, which is scheduled to start on Monday.        
	Unite union general secretary Tony Woodley said the union was prepared to call off the strike  but only if BA agreed to suspend its imposition of the new conditions on cabin crew. Lets have a pause for peace, and we will call the strike off, Woodley told BBC television.

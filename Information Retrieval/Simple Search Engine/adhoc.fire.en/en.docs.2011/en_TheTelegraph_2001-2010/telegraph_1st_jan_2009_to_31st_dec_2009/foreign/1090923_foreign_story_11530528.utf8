	London, Sept. 22 (PTI): Supermodel Naomi Campbell, who will turn 40 later this year, made a successful return to the catwalk, showing her figure in colourful swim suits.        
	Campbell, who chooses the designs she wishes to model, opted for a monochrome one-shouldered swimsuit to show her curves, a move which earned her cheers of approval from the excited audience at the London Fashion Week, reports the Daily Mail.

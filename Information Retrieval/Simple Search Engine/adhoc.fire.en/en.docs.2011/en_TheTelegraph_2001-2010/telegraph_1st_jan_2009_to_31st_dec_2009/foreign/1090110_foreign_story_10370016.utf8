The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Pak Qaida chief killed
                                                                                                               Pak Qaida chief killed
                            
	Washington, Jan. 9 (Reuters): Al Qaidas operations chief in Pakistan and a top aide are believed to be dead, a US counterterrorism official said yesterday, in what appeared to be the latest results of a campaign targeting the militant groups leadership.        
	Operations chief Usama al-Kini was thought responsible for attacks, including the bombing of a Marriott hotel in Islamabad that killed 55 people in September, and an unsuccessful attempt to kill former Pakistani Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto, who was later assassinated in a separate attack, the official said.        
	Lahore blasts        
	Ten people were injured when five bomb blasts rocked two empty theatres located near the Punjab Assembly in Lahore today.

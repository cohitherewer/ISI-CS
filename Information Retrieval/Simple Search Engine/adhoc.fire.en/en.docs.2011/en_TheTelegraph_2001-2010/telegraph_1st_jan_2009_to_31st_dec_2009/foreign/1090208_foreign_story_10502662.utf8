The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Obamas enjoy night out
                                                                                                               Obamas enjoy night out
                            
	Washington, Feb. 7 (AP): While senators worked into the night on an economic stimulus plan, President Barack Obama could sit back and relax  if only for a couple of hours  to observe a popular dance theatre group at the Kennedy Center.        
	The President and his wife, Michelle, took daughters Malia and Sasha to see the Alvin Ailey American Dance Theatre performance last night at the centre.        
	Though it was announced earlier in the day that the President would attend, the Obamas picked the right moment to reward themselves with the show. They left around a flurry of news that lawmakers had reached a deal on a stimulus measure at the heart of the Presidents plan for reviving the economy.        
	The first family got a warm welcome. As they entered their box seats  designated with the presidential seal  the crowd gave them a standing ovation amid cheers and snapshots. Some in the balcony above the Obamas reached down, apparently hoping the President would touch their hand.        
	The Obamas were accompanied by attorney general Eric Holder and his wife, Sharon Malone, and Washington mayor Adrian Fenty and his wife, Michelle.        
	Soon after the Obamas arrived, the red curtains went up and the Obamas stayed for around two hours to watch the show. The New York-based modern dance company performed along to a blend of jazz, blues and the violin.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Anti-US tensions hinder Pak effort

	Washington, Sept. 25: A new wave of anti-American sentiment in Pakistan has slowed the arrival of hundreds of US civilian and military officials charged with implementing assistance programmes, undermined cooperation in the fight against al Qaida and the Taliban and put American lives at risk, according to officials from both countries.        
	In recent weeks, Pakistan has rejected as incomplete at least 180 US government visa requests.        
	Its own ambassador in Washington has criticised what he called a blacklist used by the Pakistani intelligence service to deny visas or to conduct rigorous, intrusive and obviously crude surveillance of journalists and non-governmental aid organisations it dislikes.         
	This including the Congress-funded International Republican Institute and National Democratic Institute.        
	It would be helpful if the grounds for action against them are shared with the embassy, Ambassador Husain Haqqani wrote in late July to Pakistans foreign ministry and the ISI head.        
	Tension has been fuelled by widespread media reports in Pakistan of increased US military and intelligence activity  including the supposed arrival of 1,000 Marines and the establishment of spy centres in houses rented by the US embassy in Islamabad.         
	US ambassador Anne W. Patterson has publicly labelled the reports false, and she told local media executives in a recent letter that publishing addresses and photographs of the houses endanger[s] the lives of Americans in Pakistan.        
	At the highest levels, bilateral cooperation is said to be running smoothly. President Obama and his Pakistani counterpart Asif Ali Zardari met yesterday in New York with a gathering of Pakistans international friends.         
	With Obamas enthusiastic support, the Senate yesterday approved a $7.5 billion, five-year package that will triple non-military aid to Pakistan. The chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Admiral Mike Mullen, meets regularly with his Pakistani counterpart, General Ashfaq Kayani.        
	But just below the top, officials in Islamabad and Washington say, the relationship is fraught with mutual suspicion and is under pressure so extreme that it threatens cooperation against the insurgents.

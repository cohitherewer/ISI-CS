	Washington, Jan. 24: Two remote US missile strikes that killed at least 22 people at suspected terrorist hideouts in northwestern Pakistan yesterday offered the first tangible sign of President Barack Obamas commitment to sustained military pressure on the terrorist groups there.        
	Pakistan broadly opposes such unilateral US actions.        
	The shaky Pakistani government of Asif Ali Zardari has expressed hopes for warm relations with Obama, but members of the Presidents new national security team have already telegraphed their intention to make firmer demands of Islamabad than the Bush administration, and to back up those demands with a threatened curtailment of the plentiful military aid that has been at the heart of US-Pakistani ties for the past three decades.        
	The separate strikes on two compounds, coming three hours apart and involving five missiles fired from Afghanistan-based Predator drone aircraft, were the first high-profile hostile military actions taken under Obamas four-day-old presidency.         
	A Pakistani security official said in Islamabad that the strikes appeared to have killed at least 10 insurgents, including five foreign nationals and possibly even a high-value target such as a senior al Qaida or Taliban official.        
	It remained unclear yesterday whether Obama personally authorised the strike or was involved in its final planning, but military officials have previously said the White House is routinely briefed about such attacks in advance.        
	At his daily White House briefing, press secretary Robert Gibbs declined to answer questions about the strikes, saying: Im not going to get into these matters. Obama convened his first National Security Council meeting on Pakistan and Afghanistan yesterday afternoon, after the strike.        
	The Pakistani government, which has loudly protested some earlier strikes, was quiet yesterday. In September, US and Pakistani officials reached a tacit agreement to allow such attacks to continue without Pakistani involvement, according to senior officials in both countries. But some Pakistanis have said they expect a possibly bumpy diplomatic stretch ahead.        
	Pakistan hopes that Obama will be more patient while dealing with Pakistan, Husain Haqqani, Pakistans ambassador to Washington, said in an interview on Wednesday with Pakistans Geo television network.         
	We will review all options if Obama does not adopt a positive policy towards us. He urged Obama to hear us out.        
	At least 132 people have been killed in 38 suspected US missile strikes inside Pakistan since August, all conducted by the CIA.        
	Secretary of state Hillary Rodham Clinton indicated during her Senate confirmation hearing that the new administration will not relent in holding Pakistan to account for any shortfalls in the battle against extremists.        
	Linking Pakistan with neighbouring Afghanistan on the front line of our global counterterrorism efforts, Clinton told the Senate Foreign Relations Committee that we will use all the elements of our powers  diplomacy, development and defence  to work with those... who want to root out al Qaida, the Taliban and other violent extremists.        
	She also said those in Pakistan who do not join the effort will pay a price, adding a distinctly new element to the long-standing US effort to lure Pakistan closer to the West.

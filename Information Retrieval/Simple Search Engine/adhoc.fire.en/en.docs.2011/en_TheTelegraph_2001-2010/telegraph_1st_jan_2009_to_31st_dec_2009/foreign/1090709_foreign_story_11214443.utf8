The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | China in death penalty threat

	Urumqi (China), July 8: As northwest Chinas Xinjiang Uighur Autonomous Region settled into tense stillness today after three days of deadly ethnic violence, a Communist Party leader from the region pledged to seek the death penalty for anyone behind the strife.        
	According to state news reports, at least 156 lives were lost.        
	Li Zhi, the party boss in Urumqi, the Xinjiang capital where the violence was centred, said that many suspected instigators of the riots had been arrested and that most were students. His promise to seek the death sentence for those responsible came as Chinas President, Hu Jintao, cut short a stay in Italy.        
	The Uighurs, a Turkic ethnic group, once were a large majority in Xinjiang but now make up only about half of the provinces 20 million people.         
	In Urumqi, Uighurs are greatly outnumbered by the Han, who make up about 90 per cent of Chinas population.         
	News reports from Urumqi said up to 1,000 Han Chinese protesters gathered there today, but Li said squads of riot police and military troops had imposed calm on the city. The police and military presence on Urumqi streets was visibly beefed up today.         
	The state news agency, Xinhua, reported that many neighbourhood stores were closed, their food and bottled water sold out. A heavy paramilitary police presence enforced an overnight traffic curfew, putting the city into virtual lockdown.        
	At a news conference, Li said that 9 of the 156 known dead remained unidentified, their bodies burned too badly for families to recognise them. He did not specify the ethnicity of those who died, but one Han family member who reviewed photos of the dead, seeking to identify a relative, said in an interview that the great majority of the photographs were of Han victims.         
	In the Uighur neighbourhoods of central Urumqi, where the bulk of the violence took place, the women whose husbands and brothers had been taken away by police spoke of mounting frustration after decades of being marginalised in their own land by a Han-dominated government.         
	They dont respect our lifestyle, said one woman, a 26-year-old who gave her name as Guli. We want our dignity. We just want fairness, and we want equality.

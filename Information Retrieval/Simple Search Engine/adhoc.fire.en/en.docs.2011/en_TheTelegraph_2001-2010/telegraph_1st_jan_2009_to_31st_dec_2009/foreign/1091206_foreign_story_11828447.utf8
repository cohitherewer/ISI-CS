	Silly Boy Clooney    
	 Los Angeles, Dec. 5 (PTI): Actor George Clooney has been called a silly boy by co-star Vera Farmiga for his hilarious antics in the film Up In The Air.      
	Farmiga loved working with Clooney, who was once voted the Sexiest Man Alive, because he brought so much fun to the set, reports Parade magazine.       
	He makes you feel like you are both 10 years old and youve got a great costume box that you can dip into and play games. His sense of humour is amazing. Hes such a silly boy. He creates a very frivolous and frolicsome tone on the set, Farmiga said.     
	Julia face    
	 London (PTI): Actress Julia Roberts has been named the new face of cosmetics firm Lancome. The 41-year-old star will be the 2010 ambassadress for the company, reports www.Contactmusic.com.

Her exceptional talent, her radiance and her strong commitments, perfectly echo Lancomes values, Lancome president Youcef Nabi said.

The Dead Man Walking star, who has started playing ping-pong at her local gym, is in awe of the fact that anybody can play the sport, reports OK! magazine. I love the whole idea that it crosses all age barriers. You can have little girls beating muscle-bound 35-year-old men. And you can play it until you die, Sarandon said.

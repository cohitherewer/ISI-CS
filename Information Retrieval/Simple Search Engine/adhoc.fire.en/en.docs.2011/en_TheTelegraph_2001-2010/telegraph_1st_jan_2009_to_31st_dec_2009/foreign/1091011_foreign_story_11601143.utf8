The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Thorns in Nobel crown

	Former Cuban leader Fidel Castro lauded the award of the Nobel peace prize to Barack Obama, saying it was a positive measure. We prefer to see in the decision, more than a prize for the President of the United States, a criticism of the genocidal policies that not a few Presidents of that country have followed, Castro wrote in a column.              
	Washington, Oct. 10: President Barack Obama is given to big events at big moments, replete with stirring speeches, lofty backdrops and stadium-size crowds.        
	But when Obama walked into the Rose Garden of the White House on Friday morning, having just been awarded the Nobel peace prize  an honour that would normally be a moment of high celebration, if not the culmination of a lifes work  he was humble and self-deprecatory, popping a hole in the balloon of his own accomplishment.         
	Let me be clear: I do not view it as a recognition of my own accomplishments, but rather as an affirmation of American leadership on behalf of aspirations held by people in all nations, he said.        
	Whatever it meant on the world stage, in the US the award to Obama was a decidedly mixed blessing. It was a reminder of the gap between the ambitious promise of his words and his accomplishments.         
	It drew attention to the fact that while much of the world was celebrating him as the anti-Bush, he had not broken as fully as he had once implied he would from the previous administrations national security policies. And it set off another round of mocking criticism from opponents.        
	So while he accepted the award, Obama also sought to minimise any impression that he was basking in the glory or forgetting that he was a long way from achieving the goals  ridding the world of nuclear weapons, stopping global warming, bringing peace to West Asia, among others  that the judges seemed to expect of him.         
	He finished his day, somewhat paradoxically under the circumstances, closeted with his national security team, continuing his consideration of whether to escalate the war in Afghanistan.        
	There are, without doubt, benefits to Obama. Democrats moved quickly to portray the Nobel as an honour to the US after years of being an object of some scorn. Abroad, it provides Obama additional stature to be lumped with the likes of Nelson Mandela.         
	It was all but impossible to escape the fact that in the politically polarised world where Obama operates, this was another complication.         
	Even before Obama made it to the Rose Garden, the chairman of the Republican National Committee, Michael Steele, had issued a statement mocking Obama, a line of attack that was echoed on conservative blogs and radio talk shows throughout the day.         
	Can you imagine, folks, how big Obamas head is today? Rush Limbaugh, a conservative talk-show host, told his listeners. I think its getting so big that his ears actually fit.        
	The timing of the announcement was not ideal. Fairly or not, an emerging criticism is that after nine months, Obama has not got much done.        
	Related to the question of whether his record justified the award was the notion of whether Obama, to some degree, remains as much a symbol as a flesh-and-blood political leader. The image of Europe celebrating him as a global peacemaker recalled the period during the presidential race when Senator John McCains campaign portrayed Obama as a vapid celebrity playing to huge European crowds, a line of attack that left the normally sure-footed Obama team flummoxed.

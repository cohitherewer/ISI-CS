The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Jokes fit into 8 patterns, reveals scientist
                                                                                                               Jokes fit into 8 patterns, reveals scientist
          RICHARD ALLEYNE                              
	London, March 21: There are only eight ways to make people laugh, according to a researcher who claims to have found the key to why jokes are funny.         
	Alastair Clarke, a British evolutionary theorist, identified eight patterns which all jokes could fit into no matter where you come from in the world. Clarke came to his conclusions after studying more than 20,000 examples of humour through the ages, from a man breaking wind in the 14th century Millers Tale by Geoffrey Chaucer to BBC comedy shows like Little Britain.        
	All the humour could fit into the eight categories regardless of civilisation, culture or personal taste. While it may seem bizarre to some, these few patterns are the real stimulus that makes us laugh, regardless of the content of the sitcom were watching or the funny story were being told, said Clarke.        
	He said the brain subconsciously seeks out the patterns and when it discovers them is rewarded for its efforts.        
	Sometimes a single pattern is the cause but just as often combinations of two or three are recognised simultaneously, he said. Theoretically there is no limit to the number of patterns that may combine to make a person laugh. The patterns include positive repetition such as Little Britains Only gay in the village catchphrase and scale like the oversized features on caricatures in the puppet show Spitting Image.

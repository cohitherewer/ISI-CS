	Washington, March 12 (Reuters): The FBI raided the former office of Obama administration official Vivek Kundra and arrested two persons in a corruption probe today.        
	However, according to a spokesman for Washingtons mayor, Kundra is not a target of the investigation.        
	FBI spokeswoman Lindsay Godwin said workers Yusuf Acar and Sushil Bansal were arrested. A court appearance is expected later. The FBI searched the offices of the district of Columbias chief technology officer, a post formerly held by Kundra, as it investigates employee corruption there, spokeswoman Mafara Hobson said.        
	Godwin declined to say whether the two were arrested on bribery charges, as reported by The Washington Post. The charges remain under seal, Godwin said.         
	Acar describes himself as the agencys chief security officer in a video posted on its website.         
	Bansal is a former district of Columbia government employee who heads Advanced Integrated Technologies Corp., a firm that has won contracts from the districts technology office.         
	He won the Entrepreneur of the Year award in 2008 from an association of Indian-Americans.

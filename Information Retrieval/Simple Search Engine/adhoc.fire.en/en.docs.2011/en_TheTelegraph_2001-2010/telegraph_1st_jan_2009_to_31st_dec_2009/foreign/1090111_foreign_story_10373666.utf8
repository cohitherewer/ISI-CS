	London, Jan. 10: Dozens of girls have been suspended from a Church of England school for waging a hate campaign against a teacher on Facebook.         
	Twenty-nine pupils at Grey Coat Hospital School in Westminster, London, signed up as members of the group named The Hate Society.         
	The schools headteacher said last night that the page set up by pupils contained deeply insulting comments about the member of staff.         
	The site has now been taken down and the girls, aged between 11 and 18, were suspended for between two and 15 days after it was discovered.

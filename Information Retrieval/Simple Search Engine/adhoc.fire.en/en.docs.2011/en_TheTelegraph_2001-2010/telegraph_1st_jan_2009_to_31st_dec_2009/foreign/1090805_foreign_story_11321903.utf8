The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | For a year, men ogle women
                                                                                                               For a year, men ogle women
                            
	London, Aug. 4: Men spend almost a year of their lives ogling women, a survey claimed.         
	The average man will spend almost 43 minutes a day staring at 10 different women. That adds up to 259 hours  almost 11 days  each year, making a total of 11 months and 11 days between the ages of 18 and 50.         
	But researchers found that the males of the species are not the only ones admiring the opposite sex as women sneak a peek at six men for just over 20 minutes a day, on average. That adds up to almost six months spent admiring men from afar between the ages of 18 and 50.         
	Mark Ireland, spokesman for Kodak Lens Vision Centres, which carried out the poll, said: Men are renowned for looking at women but its interesting to find out exactly how long they spend eyeing girls up.         
	A year of their life is a long time to spend with their eyes fixed on the opposite sex. However, men have their work cut out if they are going to impress a woman as they spend half the amount of time gazing at guys.         
	The poll of 3,000 people revealed the supermarket as the location for the most ogling, followed by a pub and nightclub.         
	Women rely on the traditional ogling hotspots with pubs or bars their most popular locations.         
	But whilst the majority of men and women feel flattered at being gazed at, guys are more likely to enjoy it with 19 per cent saying it makes them feel happy, compared to just nine per cent of women. Instead, 16 per cent of girls are just left feeling uncomfortable, while 20 per cent say it embarrasses them. Over 40 per cent of women stated eyes as the first attraction whilst the same amount of men admitted their eyes were immediately drawn to a womens figure.         
	But more than half of Britons have also been left red-faced after being caught looking at someone. A third have ended up arguing with their partner over their roving eye, with one in 10 have even split up with a partner because of it. The staring has worked for some with 35 per cent of Britons saying they started a relationship with someone they eyed-up.                     THE DAILY TELEGRAPH

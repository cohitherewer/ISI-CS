                                                                                                               Nepal court reinstates generals
          J. HEMANTH                               
	Kathmandu, March 24: Nepals Supreme Court today ordered the reinstatement of eight Nepal Army brigadier- generals who had retired last week after the government refused to extend their tenures.         
	Referring to a petition filed by the officers challenging the governments decision, Justice Kalyan Shrestha said the legal process was not followed by the government while rejecting the Nepal Army chiefs request for extension of the tenures. In his order, the judge also said that his interim decree will be in force till the government proves that it complied with all legal procedures.         
	He also referred to Major General Pradip Pratap Bam Mallas case who was reinstated by the court in 2006 after the government declined to extend his tenure.         
	In their petition filed yesterday, the generals said the governments decision violated the Nepal Army Act 2006. They said the defence ministry sent a letter to the army headquarters saying that since the decision had the backing of the cabinet, the army should fill up vacant positions through promotions.

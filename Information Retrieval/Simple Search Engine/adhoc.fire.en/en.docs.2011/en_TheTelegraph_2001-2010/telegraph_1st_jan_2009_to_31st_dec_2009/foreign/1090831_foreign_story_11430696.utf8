	Hot-bod Tony    
	 London, Aug. 30 (PTI) Former British Prime Minister Tony Blair didnt have six-pack abs, but his wife Cherie fell for his nice, firm body after they first met, she has revealed.       
	 her book Speaking For Myself, Cherie wrote she was already dating two men when she dragged Tony to the top deck of a bus, and had three men in her life by the next morning. But Tonys body won her over after they met again days later.

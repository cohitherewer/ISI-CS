The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Scotland frees Lockerbie bomber
                                                                                                               Scotland frees Lockerbie bomber
                              Abdel Basset al-Megrahi (AP)                            
	Edinburgh, Aug. 20 (Reuters): Scotland today released a former Libyan agent jailed for life for the 1988 Lockerbie bombing that killed 270 people, most of them Americans, because he is dying of cancer.        
	Abdel Basset al-Megrahi, who has less than three months to live, was being returned to Libya on compassionate grounds, a decision strongly criticised by the US, which had campaigned to keep him in prison.        
	He is a dying man, he is terminally ill, Scottish justice minister Kenny MacAskill told a news conference. My decision is that he returns home to die. A Libyan government spokesman said Megrahi was being flown home with a son of Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi. Television pictures showed him being driven out of the gates of Greenock Prison in western Scotland, with a small crowd of locals booing as his convoy departed for the airport.         
	The US government, which opposed Megrahis early release, said it deeply regrets the decision.

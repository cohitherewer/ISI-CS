	Rome, Dec. 5 (AP): Italian tax police said today that they had seized works by Van Gogh, Picasso, Cezanne and other giants of art in a crackdown on assets hidden by the disgraced founder of the collapsed dairy company Parmalat.        
	Authorities estimated the 19 masterpieces stashed away in attics and basements were valued at some $150 million.        
	Parma prosecutor Gerardo Laguardia said that, based on wiretapped phone conversations, officials believed at least one of the paintings was about to be sold.         
	We got lucky. We learned that there were negotiations under way to sell one of the paintings and raid three apartments in the area of Parma, near Parmalats headquarters, Laguardia said in an interview on Italys Sky TG24 TV. He didnt identify the painting.

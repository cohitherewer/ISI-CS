	School bully     
	 London: Bullying at school can be good for children, according to an academic. Being a victim of schoolyard thugs can help pupils learn how to manage disputes and boost their ability to interact with others. Helene Guldberg, associate lecturer at the Open University, insisted teachers should not break up everyday playground disputes, saying children should be left to deal with it themselves.

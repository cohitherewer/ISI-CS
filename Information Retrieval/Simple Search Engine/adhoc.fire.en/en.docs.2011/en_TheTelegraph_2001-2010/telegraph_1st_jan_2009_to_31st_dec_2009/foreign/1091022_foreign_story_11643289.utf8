The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Pak battle for Mehsud town
                                                                                                               Pak battle for Mehsud town
                                  
	Parachinar (Pakistan), Oct. 21 (AP): Soldiers fought for control of the Pakistani Taliban chiefs hometown today, pressing forward with a major offensive targeting an insurgent stronghold along the Afghan border, authorities said.        
	The battle raged as intelligence officials said suspected US missiles killed two militants in a neighbouring region  a troubling strike because it hit territory controlled by another militant faction the army has coaxed into neutrality during its offensive.        
	The military is advancing on three fronts in South Waziristan. The fight for Kotkai town is symbolically key because Taliban chief Hakimullah Mehsud and a top deputy, Qari Hussain, hail from there. It also lies on the way to the major militant base of Sararogha.        
	An army statement today said forces were engaged in intense encounters in heights surrounding Kotkai and had secured an area east of it. Two intelligence officials said troops had secured parts of the town and also destroyed houses belonging to Mehsud and Hussain in controlled explosions, but army spokesman Major General Athar Abbas denied that late today, saying most of the fighting was on hillsides and the outskirts of the town.        
	Security forces also cleared Khaisura, a village on another front in the offensive, according to the army statement. Heavily fortified bunkers were found, some with two-metre thick concrete walls, the army said. It reported three more soldiers were killed, bringing the armys death toll so far to 16, while 15 more militants were slain.

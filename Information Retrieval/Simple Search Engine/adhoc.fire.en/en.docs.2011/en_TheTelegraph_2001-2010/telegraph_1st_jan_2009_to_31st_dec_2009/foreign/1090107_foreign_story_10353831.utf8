	Keira as muse    
	 London, Jan. 6: Keira Knightley will play Zelda Sayre, the wife of acclaimed author F. Scott Fitzgerald, in a film about their life, after a new director was announced, reports The Daily Telegraph.       
	The new biopic, called The Beautiful and the Damned, was announced last year with Knightley playing Sayre, but the project had looked set to stall after director Nick Cassavetes decided to drop out. But it has now been announced that John Curran will take his place, with filming due to begin in March.      
	The story takes place in the high society of the 1920s, when Fitzgerald wrote some of his greatest novels, including This Side of Paradise, The Beautiful and Damned and The Great Gatsby.      
	Sayre was seen as one of the most controversial literary figures of her time. Some claim her marriage to Scott Fitzgerald, inspired him to produce the Jazz Ages best novels.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | For First Lady, a hint of an agenda and tone
                                                                                                               For First Lady, a hint of an agenda and tone
          RACHEL L. SWARNS                          Michelle Obama at the inauguration in Washington. (AP)                                  
	Washington, Jan. 20: She celebrated her 45th birthday in a vintage train car, amid balloons and crepe-paper streamers, and cheering crowds serenaded her by name.        
	She danced in front of the Lincoln Memorial to Stevie Wonders Higher Ground with her husband and daughters clapping by her side. She assembled care packages for soldiers in Iraq and Afghanistan, and, in this long, whirlwind weekend, marvelled that she is now the public face of Americas first family.         
	On Inauguration Day, Michelle Obama became the first African-American to assume the role of First Lady, a woman with the power to influence the nations sense of identity, its fashion trends, its charitable causes and its perceptions of black women and their families. Already, the outlines of her style and public agenda have begun to emerge.        
	She has hired a politically seasoned team of advisers and an interior decorator committed to creating a family-friendly feel in her elegant new home. She has sketched out a vision of a White House brimming with children and ordinary Americans while suggesting she may delegate some traditional First Lady duties to her staff: food tastings, china selection and the like.                   
	She has decided to shape her public programme with the help of a policy director who has raised concerns about instances of systemic employment bias against minorities and called for tougher enforcement of antidiscrimination laws, contentious issues in the workplace.         
	And she has highlighted the warm, informal tone that she hopes will characterise her time in the executive mansion by signing email messages to supporters simply as Michelle. A Harvard-educated lawyer and a former hospital executive, Michelle Obama has made it clear that her two young daughters will be her biggest priority.         
	The causes she has promised to promote fall squarely into the realm of platforms traditionally championed by first ladies. But the staff she has assembled is also clearly prepared to tackle a tougher issues-oriented programme.        
	Her experience will guide the kinds of things she does, and her personal experience is unique for a First Lady, said Paul Schmitz, a longtime friend. She understands the needs of low-income communities. She understands the needs of women. She has balanced raising a family with a career.        
	Shell think deeply about how to use her own bully pulpit, said Schmitz, who heads Public Allies, a non-profit leadership-training network for young adults. And I think thats the challenge. You are now the most prominent woman in America. What does that mean? What do you do?        
	It is a difficult question, particularly since Michelle Obama is still grappling with how life in the grand house at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue will transform her familys existence.         
	She has grown accustomed to being in the spotlight and has consulted with Laura Bush and former First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton. But she has no experience with the day-to-day details of life in the White House. President Bush and his wife were old hands at White House living because they had visited often when Bushs father, George Bush, was running the country. Michelle Obama visited the private residence in the White House for the first time in November after the election.              
	She grew up in a tiny apartment and marvelled recently when she and her close friend Valerie Jarrett pored over photographs of the 15 bedrooms in the presidential mansion.         
	You have to pinch yourself to think that thats home, said Jarrett, who is also one of President-elect Barack Obamas closest advisers. Craig Robinson, Michelle Obamas brother, described the Obamas new reality as mind-boggling.         
	Every time I talk to her, Im like, What are you doing now? said Robinson, who has delighted in his sisters accounts of her days in Washington before the move to the White House. We are such novices at this. Im just trying to find out, How many bathrooms are in there? (The answer is 34, according to William Seale, a historian who has written about the White House.)              Los Angeles Times - Washington Post News Service

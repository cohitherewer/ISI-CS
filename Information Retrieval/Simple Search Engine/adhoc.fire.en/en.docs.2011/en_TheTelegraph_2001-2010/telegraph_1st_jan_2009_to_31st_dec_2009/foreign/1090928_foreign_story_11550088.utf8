The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | US sex case catches up with Polanski 
                                                                                                               US sex case catches up with Polanski 
                              Roman Polanski with wife Sharon Tate in London in 1960. Tate, a US actress, was murdered by a gang in 1969. She was pregnant then. The director later married French actress Emanuelle Seigner, with whom he has two children                            
	Zurich, Sept. 27 (AP): Director Roman Polanski was arrested by Swiss police as he flew in for the Zurich Film Festival and faces possible extradition to the US for having sex with a 13-year-old girl in 1977.        
	Polanski was scheduled to receive an honorary award at the festival when he was apprehended on Saturday at the airport, the Swiss justice ministry said in a statement. It said US authorities had sought the arrest of the 76-year-old director around the world since 2005.        
	There was a valid arrest request and we knew when he was coming, ministry spokesperson Guido Balmer said. Thats why he was taken into custody.        
	Polanski, the director of such classic films as Chinatown and Rosemarys Baby, fled the US for France in 1978, a year after pleading guilty to unlawful sexual intercourse with the underage girl.        
	Polanski has asked a US appeals court in California to overturn a judges refusal to throw out his case. He claims misconduct by the now-deceased judge who had arranged a plea bargain and then reneged on it.        
	His victim, Samantha Geimer, who long ago identified herself publicly, has joined in Polanskis bid for dismissal, saying she wants the case to be over. She sued Polanski and reached an undisclosed settlement.        
	In 1977, Polanski was accused of raping the teenager while photographing her during a modelling session. The girl said Polanski plied her with champagne and part of a Quaalude pill at Jack Nicholsons house while the actor was away. She said that, despite her protests, he performed oral sex, intercourse and sodomy on her.        
	Polanski was allowed to plead guilty to one of six charges, unlawful sexual intercourse, and was sent to prison for 42 days of evaluation. Lawyers agreed that would be his full sentence, but the judge tried to renege. Aware the judge would sentence him to more prison time and require his voluntary deportation, Polanski fled.        
	Polanski has lived for the past three decades in France, where his career has continued to flourish; he received a directing Oscar in absentia for the 2002 movie The Pianist.        
	Polanski, a native of France who was taken to Poland by his parents, escaped Krakows Jewish ghetto as a child during World War II and lived off the charity of strangers. His mother died at the Nazis Auschwitz death camp.        
	Swiss justice minister Eveline Widmer-Schlumpf said the director would remain in Zurich until the conclusion of the extradition proceedings. The US now has 60 days to file a formal request for Polanskis transfer, she said.        
	Polanskis French lawyer, Georges Kiejman, said it was too early to know if Polanski would be extradited. The proceedings must take their course, he said. For now, we are trying to have the arrest warrant lifted in Zurich.        
	Balmer said Polanskis arrest was not influenced by politics, even though the director had often travelled or stayed in the country.        
	Novelist Robert Harris, whose book Ghost is being made into a movie by the director, said Polanski owned a house in Gstaad, which he had visited regularly while filming in Germany, and that there was never any warning he faced arrest.        
	In the Swiss capital of Bern, Widmer-Schlumpf said Switzerland had only one legal option for dealing with Polanskis visit, and rejected the idea that there was any US pressure in ordering the arrest.        
	I know his films, they impressed me very much, she said, but she underlined that Polanski could not be given special treatment because of his artistic talent, especially because the warrant was not for a trivial complaint.        
	Balmer also rejected that the arrest was somehow aimed at winning favour with the US after a series of bilateral spats over tax evasion and wealthy Americans stashing money at Swiss banking giant UBS AG.        
	Investigators in the US learned of Polanskis planned trip days ago, giving them enough time to lay the groundwork for an arrest, said William Sorukas, chief of the US Marshals Services domestic investigations branch.

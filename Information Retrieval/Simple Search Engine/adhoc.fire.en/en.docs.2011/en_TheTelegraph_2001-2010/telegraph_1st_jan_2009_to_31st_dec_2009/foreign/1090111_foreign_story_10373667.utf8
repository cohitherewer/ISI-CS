The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Egalitarian ball
                                                                                                               Egalitarian ball
          ALEX SPILLIUS                              
	Washington, Jan. 10: One way or another, it will be a night to remember. But if Barack Obama has his way, the evening of January 20, his inauguration day, will be recalled as an egalitarian festival where his ordinary supporters hogged the limelight from the great, the good and the glamourous.         
	It is traditionally a night where the elite put on their glad rags and hit the town, parading at glitzy official inaugural balls.         
	This year, however, the premiere event will be a Neighbourhood Ball, where hundreds of Washington residents, many from poor, black parts of the city, as well as grassroots followers of the President-elect will be invited for free among a crowd that will be several thousand strong. Other tickets will go for as little as $25, compared to the average $250 for more exclusive affairs. Dozens of small, cheaper events with beer and wine rather than cocktails and spirits, are being organised to honour the first black President.         
	This is an inauguration for all Americans, said Obama. I wanted to make sure that we had an event that would be open to our new neighbourhood here in Washington DC, and also neighbourhoods across the country. A spokesman for his transition team added: With tickets available free or at an affordable price, it is the first official inaugural ball of its kind.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Jail for Bush shoe-thrower
                                                                                                               Jail for Bush shoe-thrower
                            
	Baghdad, March 12 (Reuters): An Iraqi reporter who hurled his shoes at former President George W. Bush was convicted of attempting to assault a foreign leader today and jailed for three years.        
	Muntazer al-Zaidi, 30, who pleaded not guilty to the charge, told the Baghdad court: What I did was a natural reaction for the crimes committed against the Iraqi people. Zaidi earned instant global fame in December when he threw his shoes at the visiting US leader, who spearheaded the 2003 invasion of Iraq, and called him a dog at a news conference.

	Kathmandu, Jan 5: Nepal President Ram Baran Yadav today asked Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal, alias Prachanda, to respect the supreme courts interim order on the Pashupatinath temple crisis.        
	Sources told The Telegraph today that Yadav summoned Dahal to his office this morning and told him that replacing the South Indian priests at the temple with locals not only ended a three- century-old tradition, but also politicised religious activities. President Yadav pointed out that the Maoist action may affect Nepals traditional ties with India,the sources said.         
	Later, Prachanda said: The government will respect the order of the apex court.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Lanka boss faces US test 
                                                                                                               Lanka boss faces US test 
                              Sarath Fonseka                            
	Colombo, Nov. 1 (PTI): US authorities have asked Sri Lankan army chief Sarath Fonseka, who led the military offensive on the LTTE, to testify before them over allegations of widespread human rights abuse by the defence forces during the war.        
	The chief of defence staff has told the government that he has been asked to give evidence against defence secretary Gotabhaya Rajapaksa, brother of President Mahinda Rajapaksa, over the allegations, a media report said today. The US state department had recently submitted to Congress a report on the incidents during the recent conflict.        
	Fonseka has written to the Sri Lankan mission in Washington saying he has been asked by the US officials to give evidence against Gotabhaya over alleged human rights abuses, the Daily Mirror Online said.        
	It said Fonseka, currently in the US, was reportedly contacted by two US officials, prompting fears in Colombo that Washington is asserting its legal authority over the war crimes report released last week.        
	Official sources here said this matter is being discussed at a higher level. We have no comments at this point of time.        
	The Sunday Times, London, has reported that Fonseka has been told to face a voluntary meeting with the homeland security department and that officials want to interview him on Wednesday.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Speed of vote count fuels suspicion
                                                                                                               Speed of vote count fuels suspicion
                            
	Cairo, June 16 (AP): How do you count almost 40 million handwritten paper ballots in a matter of hours and declare a winner?         
	Thats a key question in Irans disputed presidential election. International polling experts and Iran analysts said the speed of the vote count, coupled with a lack of detailed election data normally released by officials, was fuelling suspicion around President Mahmoud Ahmadinejads landslide victory.        
	Reformist candidate Mir Hossein Mousavis newspaper, Kalemeh Sabz, or the Green Word, reported on its website that more than 10 million votes were missing national identification numbers similar to US Social Security numbers, which make the votes untraceable.         
	It did not say how it knew that information.        
	 Mousavi said some polling stations closed early with voters still in line, and he charged that representatives of his campaign were expelled from polling centres even though each candidate was allowed one observer at each location. He has not provided evidence to support the accusations.

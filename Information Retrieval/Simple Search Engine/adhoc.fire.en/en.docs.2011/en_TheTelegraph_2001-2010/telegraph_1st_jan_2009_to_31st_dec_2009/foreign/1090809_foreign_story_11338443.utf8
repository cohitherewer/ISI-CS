	Colombo, Aug. 8 (AP): Sri Lanka hailed elections today near an area once dominated by the Tamil Tiger rebels as the first seeds of democracy sprouting along the former battlefields of its recently ended civil war.        
	But Opposition parties accused the ruling coalition of restricting their campaigns, the government barred most media from the region, and voters appeared apathetic to the first elections in the northern cities of Vavuniya and Jaffna since 1998.        
	 The cities, where Tamils are a majority, are just outside the shadow state the Tamil Tigers ran as a virtual dictatorship and were frequently hit by violence during the quarter-century civil war.        
	The government recaptured the territory and routed the rebels on the battlefield in May, ending a conflict that killed between 80,000 and 100,000 people. The rebels were fighting for a separate state for minority Tamils after decades of marginalisation by governments dominated by the Sinhalese majority.        
	This is another step toward strengthening democracy in the north, said Douglas Devananda, a government minister from Jaffna.        
	Devanandas Tamil party - with its armed paramilitary wing  is leading the ruling coalitions election slate in Jaffna.        
	Polls opened today at 0130 GMT with 125,043 eligible voters set to elect 34 members to municipal councils in the two cities.        
	In Jaffna, few voters turned up at polling stations, with election monitors saying less than 20 per cent of eligible voters had cast their votes by afternoon. We have undergone a lot of hardships but we have no solutions to our problems. So we are in no mood to vote.         
	Its not going to make any difference, 52-year-old G. Selvam said, explaining why he was staying away from the polls.        
	 Six political parties and independent groups fielded 174 candidates for Jaffna, while 135 politicians from nine parties contested seats in Vavuniya. Results were expected tomorrow.        
	The government was also holding an election in Uva province to the south and was likely to get a boost from the recent capture of the rebels new leader, Selvarasa Pathmanathan.        
	Pathmanathan, the LTTEs former chief weapons smuggler, was arrested in Southeast Asia and sent back to Sri Lanka, where he was being questioned, the government said yesterday.        
	Sri Lankan defence spokesman Keheliya Rambukwella said the arrest showed that we are capable of demolishing any future emergence of the LTTE.        
	Despite the rebels defeat, both Jaffna and Vavuniya remain surrounded by government checkpoints and are accessible only with written permission from the defence ministry. Even residents cant leave without permission.

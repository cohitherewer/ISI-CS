	Rome, April 7: The earthquake in Abruzzo did not spare the regions artistic patrimony, though government officials said yesterday that it was too soon to determine the extent of the damage to historical buildings or works of art.        
	In LAquila, the regional capital, the earthquake caused significant damage to monuments, said Giuseppe Proietti, secretary general of the Italian culture ministry. The rear part of the Romanesque basilica of Santa Maria di Collemaggio, much of which was restored in the 20th century, collapsed and cupolas in at least two churches in the historic centre had cracked open.         
	The third floor of the 16th-century castle that houses the National Museum of Abruzzo was also affected by the quake, though officials have not been able to verify the damage to the art collection there. The news agency Ansa reported that the Porta Napoli, built in 1548 in honour of the Holy Roman Emperor Charles V, was destroyed in the quake.         
	The situation is very serious, but findings are at a preliminary stage, Proietti said. He added that only after firefighters and civil protection teams had concluded their rescue efforts and search for survivors would the states art officials be allowed to enter into the rubble-strewn cities to calculate the material losses to Abruzzos cultural heritage. Right now, getting around is impossible, he said in a telephone interview.         
	Yesterdays earthquake, with a 6.3 magnitude, was not the first to strike the central Italian city. In 1703, a quake destroyed much of the medieval historic centre, which was then rebuilt in the Baroque style, according to Alessandro Clementi, who has written several books on the history of LAquila, which was founded in the 13th century and had its moment of greatest socioeconomic importance in the Renaissance.        
	What risks being lost is a point of reference of European civilization, said Clementi.         
	He was in the countryside outside LAquila, and had not seen the damage to the city firsthand.        
	Difficulties in communication between the culture ministry and art officials in the cities affected by the earthquake were also making it hard to gauge the extent of the damage.         
	Its a tragic situation, because were only getting news a drop at a time, said Maria Teresa Spinozzi, an art official in Pescara, an Abruzzo city not affected by the quake. But right now, the priority is saving people under the rubble.

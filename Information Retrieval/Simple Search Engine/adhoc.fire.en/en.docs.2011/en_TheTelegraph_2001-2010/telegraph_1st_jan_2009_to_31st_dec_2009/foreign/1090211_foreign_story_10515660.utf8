	Colombo, Feb. 10 (Agencies): Tamil Tiger rebels today gunned down 19 Tamils, including women and children, and wounded 75 others in a bid to stop them from fleeing rebel-held areas, the military said.        
	Survivors of the attack arrived at a military post and narrated how the Tigers fired on them as they tried to cross the frontlines, army spokesman Udaya Nanayakkara said.        
	They were part of a group of about 1,000 civilians who bought the bodies. They said that the LTTE cadres fired on them to stop them seeking shelter with security forces, he added. The dead included six women and two children, officials said.        
	With the LTTE fast losing territory in fierce fighting with Lankan troops, thousands of refugees were streaming out of the war zone in the northern region.        
	The attack took place as the Red Cross began loading more than 400 sick and wounded onto a boat in a daring rescue operation near LTTE-held Pudukudiyiruppu.        
	Nanayakkara said todays attack on civilians took place at around 6am in Udayarkattu, also in Pudukudiyyrippu.        
	This was the second major attempt by the Tigers to stop the Tamil civilians, who the Sri Lankan government say are being held as human shields.        
	Yesterday, an LTTE female suicide bomber blew herself up at a refugee centre in Mullaitivu, killing 29 people, including 10 civilians, and injuring 64, 40 of them civilians.        
	The number of people fleeing the fighting between Sri Lankas army and the LTTE has picked up sharply in the past week, with the separatist rebels now confined to less than 175 squarekm.        
	Nearly 50,000 soldiers are converging on the Indian Ocean islands northeast, aiming to deal a death blow to a civil war that has flared off and on since 1983.        
	The ICRC said today it had begun loading 400 patients from a makeshift hospital in the coastal village of Puttumatalan, and an unknown number of their relatives, onto a ferry after agreeing safe passage for them.

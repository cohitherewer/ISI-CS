                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      3 killed in Pak press club blast
                                  
	Peshawar, Dec. 22 (Reuters): A suicide bomber killed three people outside a popular press club today in Peshawar, officials said.        
	Peshawar, capital of North West Frontier Province, has been hit by numerous bomb attacks since the army went on the offensive against Pakistani Taliban militants in their South Waziristan stronghold on the Afghan border in October.        
	Hundreds of people have been killed in the attacks since the offensive began. Another 17 were wounded in todays bombing outside the press club.        
	It was a suicide attack. The bomber wanted to get into the press club and, when our police guard stopped him, he blew himself up, city police chief Liaqat Ali Khan said.        
	Two policemen and a passerby were killed, a Peshawar city official said. At least one of the dead lay near a gate into the red-brick club, television pictures showed, and broken glass littered the ground after the blast smashed the clubs windows.        
	Peshawar is the gateway to the Khyber Pass and an ancient trading crossroad between South Asias plains and the mountains of Afghanistan. It is a key battleground both for Pakistan and its ally Washington, which wants to make sure local political dont distract Islamabad from the wider fight against militancy.        
	Peshawar reporters said militants had threatened to attack journalists since the South Waziristan assault began. Reporters have been attacked and killed in ethnic Pashtun tribal regions along the Afghan border but todays blast was the first on a reporters club in a city.        
	Malik jail terms        
	A Pakistani court today suspended two jail terms awarded to interior minister Rehman Malik over a decade ago on corruption charges and granted him bail after graft cases were reopened against him by the Supreme Court.        
	A two-judge bench of the Lahore High Court suspended the operation of the two three-year prison terms that were awarded to Malik in the 1990s.

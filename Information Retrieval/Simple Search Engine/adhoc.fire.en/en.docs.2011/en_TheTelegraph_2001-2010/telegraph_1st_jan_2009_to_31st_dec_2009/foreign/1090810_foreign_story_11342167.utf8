	Alive in coffin    
	 London, Aug. 9: Paraguayans have hailed a miracle after a grieving father opened his baby sons coffin and discovered that the infant was still alive, hours after doctors pronounced him dead, reports The Sunday Telegraph.       
	Jose Alvarenga was told by doctors at a hospital in Asuncion, the Paraguayan capital, that his son had been pronounced dead shortly after birth. Hospital orderlies delivered the premature babys body, which had been placed in a temporary coffin, to Alvarengas home fours hours later.       
	Shortly afterwards, the father opened the coffin to bid farewell to the infant. I opened it to look at his remains and found that the baby was breathing, Alvarenga recounted. He rushed back to the hospital with his son in his arms. Doctors said the boys condition was stable.    
	Andre blow    
	 London (PTI): Pop singer Peter Andre is shocked and hurt that his former wife Katie Price let their four-year-old son see her in bed with her new boyfriend, cage fighter Alex Reid. Andre, who split from model-turned-TV star Price recently, has accused her of dealing him the lowest blow ever with the act, the Sun has reported online. I cant even bring myself to say the other name, but Junior just said, Why is he in bed with Mummy? What is he doing in Mummys bed?, Andre said.

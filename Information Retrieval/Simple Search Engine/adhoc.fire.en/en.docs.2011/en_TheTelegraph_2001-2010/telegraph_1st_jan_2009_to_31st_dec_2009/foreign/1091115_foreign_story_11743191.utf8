	Hurley family    
	 London, Nov. 14 (PTI): Actress Elizabeth Hurley, who is married to Indian entrepreneur Arun Nayar, wants to become a mother again.      
	However, she is facing opposition from her seven-year-old son who does not want a sibling.      
	The actress has said that she and Nayar want to extend their family and are considering having a baby together, but her son Damian is against it.       
	Hurleys only child with ex-boyfriend Steve Bing has said that their family is big enough. Were in two minds about this. Damian doesnt want us to add to our family under any circumstances  he wants to remain the golden prince! He says: Mummy, our family is big enough! We toy with the idea, but were not sure, said Hurley.

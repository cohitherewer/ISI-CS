                                                                                                               Pak ban lifted
                            
	Islamabad, Aug. 14 (AP): Pakistan lifted a ban on political activities in its tribal regions today, granting the areas close to the Afghan border parliamentary representation for the first time        
	This breaks the monopoly of clerics to play politics from the pulpit of the mosque to the exclusion of major secular political parties, a spokesman for President Zardari said.

	Stockholm, Oct. 5 (AP): Americans Elizabeth H. Blackburn, Carol W. Greider and Jack W. Szostak won the 2009 Nobel Prize in medicine today for discovering a key mechanism in the genetic operations of cells, an insight that has inspired new lines of research into cancer.        
	It was the first time two women have been among the winners of the medicine prize.        
	The trio solved the mystery of how chromosomes, the rod-like structures that carry DNA, protect themselves from degrading when cells divide.        
	The Nobel citation said the laureates found the solution in the ends of the chromosomes  features called telomeres that are often compared to the plastic tips at the end of shoe laces that keep those laces from unravelling.        
	Blackburn and Greider discovered the enzyme that builds telomeres  telomerase  and the mechanism by which it adds DNA to the tips of chromosomes to replace genetic material that has eroded away.        
	The prize-winners work, done in the late 1970s and 1980s, set the stage for research suggesting that cancer cells use telomerase to sustain their uncontrolled growth. Scientists are studying whether drugs that block the enzyme can fight the disease.         
	The discoveries by Blackburn, Greider and Szostak have added a new dimension to our understanding of the cell, shed light on disease mechanisms, and stimulated the development of potential new therapies, the prize committee said in its citation.        
	Ten women have won the prestigious medicine award since the first Nobel Prizes were handed out in 1901, but it was the first time that two women were honoured in the same year.

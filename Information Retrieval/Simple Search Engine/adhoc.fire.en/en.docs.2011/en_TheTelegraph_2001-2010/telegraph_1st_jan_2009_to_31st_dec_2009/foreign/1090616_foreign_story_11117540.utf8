The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Iran cleric for probe, protesters defy ban
                                                                                                               Iran cleric for probe, protesters defy ban
          ROBERT F. WORTH AND NAZILA FATHI                          Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei . (Reuters)                                            
	Tehran, June 15: Hundreds of thousands of people marched in silence through central Tehran today to protest Irans disputed presidential election in an extraordinary show of defiance that appeared to be the largest anti-government demonstration in Iran since the 1979 revolution.         
	The march began hours after Irans supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, called for an inquiry into Opposition claims that the election was rigged in favour of President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad.         
	The ayatollahs call  announced every 15 minutes on Iranian state radio throughout the day  was the first sign that Irans top leaders may be rethinking its position on the election. Khamenei announced on Saturday that the election results showing a landslide victory for Ahmadinejad were fair, but yesterday he met Mir Hussein Moussavi, the former Prime Minister and moderate who was the main Opposition candidate, to listen to his concerns.         
	As evening fell, Iranian state television reported that shots had been fired at protesters, and Reuters, quoting an Iranian photographer, reported that the gunfire had apparently come from a compound used by the pro-government Basij militia. At least one person was reported to have been killed.                   Protesters carry the body of a man, allegedly shot by the pro-government Basij militia, during a demonstration by supporters of defeated candidate Mir Hossein Mousavi in Tehran on Monday. (Reuters)       
	It was impossible to independently confirm these reports, which came after a day during which government security forces stood by at the edges of the avenues, allowing the demonstrators to stream past. The silent march was a deliberate and striking contrast with the chaos of the past few days, when riot police sprayed tear gas and wielded clubs to disperse scattered bands of angry young people.         
	In Isfahan, south of the capital, more violence broke out today, with police attacking a crowd of several thousand Opposition protesters with sticks and tear gas, and rioters setting fires in parts of the city.         
	The broad river of people in Tehran  young and old, dressed in traditional Islamic gowns and the latest western fashions  marched slowly from Revolution Square to Freedom Square for more than three hours. Many wore the signature bright green ribbons of Moussavis campaign, and held up their hands in victory signs. When the occasional shout or chant went up, the crowd quickly hushed them, and some held up signs bearing the word silence.        
	These people are not seeking a revolution, said Ali Reza, a young actor in a brown T-shirt who stood for a moment watching on the rallys sidelines. We dont want this regime to fall. We want our votes to be counted, because we want reforms, we want kindness, we want friendship with the world.         
	Moussavi, who had called for the rally yesterday but never received official permission for it, joined the crowd, as did Mohammad Khatami, the reformist former President. But the crowd was so vast, and communications had been so sporadic  the authorities have cut off phone and text-messaging services repeatedly in recent days  that many marchers seemed unaware they were there.         
	We dont really have a leader, said Mahdiye, a 20-year-old student. Moussavi wants to do something, but they wont let him. It is dangerous for him, and we dont want to lose him. We dont know how far this will go. The protestors said they had another major rally planned for tomorrow.

	Everest cricket    
	 Kathmandu, April 21 (AP): Two teams of British cricketers played on the foot of Mount Everest today in an attempt to set a high-altitude record for field sports.      
	The teams played the Twenty-20 cricket match today at Gorakshep, located 5,165 metres above sea level on the southern side of the worlds highest mountain in Nepal.      
	Team Hillary defeated team Tenzing in the match, organisers said in an email.      
	The two teams are named after New Zealander Edmund Hillary and his Sherpa guide Tenzing Norgay, the two mountaineers who first conquered the 8,850-metre peak on May 29, 1953. Organisers hoped to raise more than $365,000 from sponsors for two charities.

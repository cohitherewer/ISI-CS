	Dhaka, April 23 (PTI): At least 16 Bangladesh Rifles soldiers, who have been accused of involvement in a bloody rebellion in the paramilitary force, have died in custody, the BDR said.        
	 While four committed suicide, six died of heart attacks and six succumbed to their illnesses in Dhaka and outside the capital, the force said.        
	 A total of 1,171 suspected BDR rebels have been arrested for the February mutiny. The 16 deaths took place between March 9 and April 16 amidst concern that the rebel guards were being tortured in custody.         
	 A spokesman today said that in some units, incidents of suicide by BDR soldiers after the February 25-26 mutiny were on the rise.

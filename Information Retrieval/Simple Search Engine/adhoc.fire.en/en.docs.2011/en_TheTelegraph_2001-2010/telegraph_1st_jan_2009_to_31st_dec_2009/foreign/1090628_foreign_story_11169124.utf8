                              Abolfazl Fateh                                
	Tehran, June 27 (Reuters): Iran has banned an ally of the countrys Opposition leader Mir Hossein Mousavi from leaving the Islamic state, the official Irna news agency reported today.        
	Abolfazl Fateh, head of Mousavis media office, said the ban would not change his political stance, adding he was banned from leaving Iran because of his role in post-election developments.        
	Such pressures can not push people like me to change our political stances, he told Irna. The imposed ban will not change my political views.        
	Iranian authorities have used a combination of warnings, arrests and the threat of police action over the last week to drive mass rallies off Tehrans street with smaller gatherings dispersed with tear gas and baton charges.        
	State media have said 20 people were killed in violence since the June 12 election  won by hardline President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad  and authorities accuse Mousavi of responsibility for the bloodshed. He says the government is to blame.         
	The state-run Iran newspaper said Fateh, who had been studying for a doctorate in Britain, was banned from leaving the country because of his involvement in post-election developments. Mousavi has called for an annulment of the vote because of election rigging.        
	The semi-official Ilna news agency said Mousavi urged the interior ministry to allow a rally by his supporters at Azadi square in southwest Tehran. No date was mentioned in the report.        
	Irans top legislative body has said it found no major violations in the presidential election which it described as the healthiest since the 1979 Islamic Revolution, but said 10 percent of ballot boxes would be recounted. Tehran streets were calm today .The establishment has made it clear it had no intention of holding a new election.

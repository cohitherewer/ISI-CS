The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Sarko holiday angers Paris
                                                                                                               Sarko holiday angers Paris
          HENRY SAMUEL                          Sarkozy in Mexico City. (AP)                                  
	Paris, March 10: President Nicolas Sarkozy and his wife Carla have provoked an outcry in France by spending the weekend in a 2,100-a-night beach-front villa in Mexico.        
	The couple spent the weekend at the El Tamarindo Beach and Golf Resort, located in a nature reserve on Mexicos southeastern Pacific Coast. The villa cost 1,640 plus 17 per cent tax and 10 per cent service charge  making a total of just over 2,100 per night. However, the overall cost, including security and staff, is believed to have come to 45,000.        
	The visit was shrouded in secrecy and disclosed only after Carla Bruni-Sarkozy inadvertently told friends at a charity event on Thursday afternoon that Im leaving tonight for Mexico after her husband had burst in a little earlier.        
	The one-bedroom villa, owned by a multi-millionaire friend of Mexicos President Felipe Calder, comes with private pool, outdoor Jacuzzi, butler, cook and maid.         
	I find [the holiday] very shocking at a time of international crisis and rising unemployment, Marielle de Sarnez, the vice-president of the centrist Modem party, said. At root, it reveals the glaring gap between the President and the people: he is not aware of the state of the country and what the French are going through.

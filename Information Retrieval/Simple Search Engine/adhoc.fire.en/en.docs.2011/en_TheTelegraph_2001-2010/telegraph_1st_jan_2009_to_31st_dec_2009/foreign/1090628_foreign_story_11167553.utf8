	Los Angeles, June 27 (Reuters): Michael Jacksons former wife Lisa Marie Presley said yesterday the pop star was a tortured soul who once predicted that he would end up like her father, the late rock icon Elvis Presley.        
	Writing on her MySpace blog, Presley also ripped into reports in the media that her relationship with Jackson was contrived, saying they split because she could not save him from self-destructive behaviour.        
	Our relationship was not a a sham as is being reported in the press, Presley, 41, wrote in the blog posting, which was verified by her spokesperson.        
	She called it an unusual relationship but added: Nonetheless, I do believe he loved me as much as he could love anyone and I loved him very much.        
	Presley, the only daughter of the original King of Rock Roll and a performer in her own right, describes having a conversation with Jackson about her fathers August 16, 1977 death. Elvis Presley died at age 42 of a heart attack after years of drug use.        
	At some point he (Jackson) paused, he stared at me very intensely and he stated with an almost calm certainty: I am afraid that I am going to end up like him, the way he did. Presley wrote that she tried to deter Jackson from the idea, but he shook his head and nodded as if he knew what he knew.

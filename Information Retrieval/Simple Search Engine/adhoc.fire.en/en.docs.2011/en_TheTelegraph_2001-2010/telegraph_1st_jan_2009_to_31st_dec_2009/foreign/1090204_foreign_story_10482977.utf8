The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | IBM to build fastest computer to manage nukes
                                                                                                               IBM to build fastest computer to manage nukes

	San Francisco, Feb. 3: A supercomputer with the processing power of two million laptops is to be built by IBM for the US government to help manage its nuclear arsenal.         
	IBM announced it was developing the technology for its Sequoia system, which will be easily the fastest computer on the planet, with delivery to the Department of Energy (DOE) scheduled in 2011.         
	According to IBM, Sequoia will be able to achieve performance speeds of up to 20 petaflops or 20,000 trillion calculations a second. IBM estimates that the computing power of the Sequoia system will be greater than that of every one of the current systems on the Top 500 supercomputer rankings combined.         
	The system will be housed at the US department of energys Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in California. The system will contain more than 1.6 million microprocessors, placed in a series of 96 refrigerator-sized racks. The supercomputer will be contained in a 3,422 sq feet building  the size of a large house.         
	As microprocessors have become much smaller and more powerful, they have also become more energy efficient. Sequoia will use only about 6 megawatts of energy a year  the equivalent to the power consumed by 500 American homes a year. Before IBM builds the Sequoia supercomputer, the companys engineers will begin work on Dawn, a supercomputer which is designed to deliver 500 teraflops or 500 trillion calculations per second.         
	Dawn will act as the delivery system for Sequoias computing operations. Both systems will be constructed at IBMs BlueGene facilities in Minnesota. If completed as planned the Sequoia supercomputer will smash the record IBM set with its Roadrunner system which went online last year.         
	The $100 million system, which is installed at the DOEs Los Alamos Laboratory in New Mexico, has a peak performance of 1.105 petaflops.         
	The main purpose of the Sequoia programme is to run complex computer simulations for nuclear weapons research.         
	It will allow nuclear scientists to determine whether weapons are safe and will work as required under the DOEs National Nuclear Security Administration stockpile stewardship programme.         
	The problem we have with the nuclear stockpile is similar to one you might have at home with a car youve kept in the garage for 20 to 30 years, Mark Seager, assistant department head for advanced technology at Lawrence Livermore, told PC World.         
	How do you carefully maintain the car as it ages so that when you go to start the car, you can be very confident it will start? That the probability that it wont start is less than 1 in a million? Thats a pretty high level of certitude.         
	IBM said that Sequoia would also be used for research into astronomy, energy, the human genome and climate change. The system will allow forecasters to predict local weather events that are less than 1km across, it said, compared to 10km today.         
	The second fastest computer on the planet at the moment is the Cray XT Jaguar supercomputer, which is located in Tennessee.

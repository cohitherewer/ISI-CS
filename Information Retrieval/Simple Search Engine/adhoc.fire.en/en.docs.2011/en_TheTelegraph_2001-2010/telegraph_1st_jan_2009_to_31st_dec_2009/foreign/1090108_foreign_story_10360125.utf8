	Gaza, Jan. 7 (Reuters): Hundreds of embattled Palestinians ventured outside to shop for food today during a three-hour Gaza truce, a first step towards an Egyptian-proposed ceasefire under discussion by Israel and Hamas.        
	Food and milk  what else can we hope for in three hours, said Ahmed Abu Kamel, a father of six who lives near the city of Gaza. We want it all to end.        
	Violence resumed in the area soon after the 1pm-4pm truce expired, and Palestinians returned to the precarious safety of their home after stocking up on food and visiting family and friends.        
	Israel said it would cease attacks in the Gaza Strip during those hours every day to ease the flow of aid to the Hamas-run territorys 1.5 million residents.         
	A day after Israeli shelling killed 42 Palestinians at a UN-run Gaza school, Israel said it viewed positively talks with Cairo over a wider ceasefire plan promoted by Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak and French leader Nicolas Sarkozy.        
	We welcome the French-Egyptian initiative. We want to see it succeed, said Mark Regev, spokesman for Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert, whose security cabinet decided to delay a decision on expanding a 12-day-old Gaza offensive.

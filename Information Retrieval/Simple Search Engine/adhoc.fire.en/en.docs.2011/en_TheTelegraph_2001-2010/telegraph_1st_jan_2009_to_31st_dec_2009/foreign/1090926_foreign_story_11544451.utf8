	Theron claws    
	 London, Sept. 25 (PTI): Actress Charlize Theron has become the latest star to eye the role of Catwoman after she revealed her desperation to sink her claws into a Batman film.      
	The actress insists she would love the chance to transform into the feline femme fatale, offering her name up for casting directors.      
	 I think what has happened to that franchise is amazing. (Batman filmmaker) Chris Nolan is a genius. I would be an idiot to not consider that part, the South African beauty said.     
	Jolie hate    
	 London (PTI): Actress Angelina Jolie hates to read about her personal life in the papers and wonders why people are so interested to know about her relationship with Brad Pitt. I dont ask for all this tabloid attention so I never read what they write about us. First I see myself as a mother, Jolie said.

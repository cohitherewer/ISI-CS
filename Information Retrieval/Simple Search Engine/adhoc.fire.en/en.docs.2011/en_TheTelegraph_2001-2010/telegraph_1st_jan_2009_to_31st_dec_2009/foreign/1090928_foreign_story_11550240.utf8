	Robert darts
  
	 Los Angeles, Sept. 27 (PTI): Actor Robert Pattinson is reportedly so sick of seeing his photographs in magazines that he invited his co-stars to throw darts at a picture of his face. 
   
	Robert got a magazine cover with a picture of his face on it and pinned it to a dartboard that was in his trailer. He took shots at it and asked everyone else to do the same, a source on the set of The Twilight Saga: New Moon told the National Enquirer magazine. The 23-year-old is finding his newfound fame increasingly difficult to cope with, and had confessed he came close to losing it earlier this year.
  
	Animal haul
  
	London: Police have discovered 1,700 live animals crammed into the boot of a hatchback in Bari, Italy, during a routine check, reports The Sunday Telegraph. The animals included 216 budgies, 300 white mice, 150 hamsters, 30 Japanese squirrels, six cameleons and more than 1,000 terrapins. The officers found the animals in stacked boxes when driver Francesco Lombardo opened the boot.

	Eye for a tooth    
	 London, July 5: A man who was blinded in an accident at work has got back his vision after his tooth was transplanted into his eye to restore his sight, reports The Sunday Telegraph.       
	Martin Jones, 42, a builder, had been blind for 12 years after a tub of white hot aluminium exploded in his face as he worked at a scrapyard. He married his wife Gill, 50, four years ago but had not seen her until after the delicate eight-hour operation.       
	The rare procedure meant that one of Jones front teeth was removed and used as a lens holder in his right eye  his left eye had to be removed after the accident.       
	One of Jones canine teeth was removed and converted into a holder for a special optical lens by drilling a hole in it. The tooth was then inserted into his cheek for three months to enable it to grow new tissue and blood vessels. Then finally came the delicate operation to insert the tooth, complete with the fitted lens, into Joness right eyeball.    
	Glum Brits    
	 London: British people are less satisfied with life than many in poorer countries, according to a poll that ranks Britain 74th in the world below Georgia and Burma, reports The Sunday Telegraph. Rather than measure Gross Domestic Product, the Happy Planet Index measures life expectancy, happiness and the environmental impact of different nations. The top 10 countries are not the richest nations but middle income countries in Latin America, Asia and the Carribbean where there is a high level of life satisfaction and low carbon footprint. Costa Rica is the greenest and happiest country on the planet, according to the rankings developed by the New Economics Foundation.

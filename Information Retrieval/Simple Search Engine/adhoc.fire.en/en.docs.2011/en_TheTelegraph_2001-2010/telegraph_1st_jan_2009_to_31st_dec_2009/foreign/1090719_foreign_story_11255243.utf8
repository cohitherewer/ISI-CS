	New York, July 18: Walter Cronkite, who pioneered and then mastered the role of television news anchorman with such plain-spoken grace that he was called the most trusted man in America, died yesterday at his home in New York. He was 92.         
	The cause was complications of dementia, said Chip Cronkite, his son.         
	From 1962 to 1981, Cronkite was a nightly presence in American homes and always a reassuring one, guiding viewers through national triumphs and tragedies alike, from moonwalks to war, in an era when network news was central to many peoples lives.        
	He became something of a national institution, with an unflappable delivery, a distinctively avuncular voice and a daily benediction: And thats the way it is. He was Uncle Walter to many: respected, liked and listened to. With his trimmed moustache and calm manner, he even bore a resemblance to another trusted American fixture, another Walter  Walt Disney.        
	Along with Chet Huntley and David Brinkley on NBC, Cronkite was among the first celebrity anchormen. In 1995, 14 years after he retired from the CBS Evening News, a TV Guide poll ranked him number one in seven of eight categories for measuring television journalists. (He professed incomprehension that Maria Shriver beat him out in the eighth category, attractiveness.)         
	He was so widely known that in Sweden anchormen were once called Cronkiters.        
	Yet he was a reluctant star. He was genuinely perplexed when people rushed to see him rather than the politicians he was covering, and even more astonished by the repeated suggestions that he run for office himself. He saw himself as an old-fashioned newsman  his title was managing editor of the CBS Evening News  and so did his audience.        
	The viewers could more readily picture Walter Cronkite jumping into a car to cover a 10-alarm fire than they could visualise him doing cerebral commentary on a great summit meeting in Geneva, David Halberstam wrote in The Powers That Be, his 1979 book about the news media.        
	As anchorman and reporter, Cronkite described wars, natural disasters, nuclear explosions, social upheavals and space flights, from Alan Shepards 15-minute ride to lunar landings. On July 20, 1969, when the Eagle touched down on the moon, Cronkite exclaimed, Oh, boy!        
	On the day President John F. Kennedy was assassinated, Cronkite briefly lost his composure in announcing that the President had been pronounced dead at Parkland Memorial Hospital in Dallas. Taking off his black-framed glasses and blinking back tears, he registered the emotions of millions. It was an uncharacteristically personal note from a newsman who was uncomfortable expressing opinion.         
	I am a news presenter, a news broadcaster, an anchorman, a managing editor  not a commentator or analyst, he said in an interview with The Christian Science Monitor in 1973. I feel no compulsion to be a pundit.         
	But when he did pronounce judgment, the impact was large. In 1968, he visited Vietnam and returned to do a rare special programme on the war. He called the conflict a stalemate and advocated a negotiated peace.         
	President Lyndon B. Johnson watched the broadcast, Cronkite wrote in his 1996 memoir, A Reporters Life, quoting a description of the scene by Bill Moyers, then a Johnson aide. The President flipped off the set, Moyers recalled, and said: If Ive lost Cronkite, Ive lost middle America.        
	Cronkite sometimes pushed beyond the usual two-minute limit to news items. On October 27, 1972, his 14-minute report on Watergate, followed by an eight-minute segment four days later, put the Watergate story clearly and substantially before millions of Americans for the first time, the broadcast historian Marvin Barrett wrote in Moments of Truth? (1975).        
	In 1977, his separate interviews with President Anwar el-Sadat of Egypt and Prime Minister Menachem Begin of Israel were instrumental in Sadats visiting Jerusalem. The countries later signed a peace treaty.        
	From his earliest days, Halberstam wrote, he was one of the hungriest reporters around, wildly competitive, no one was going to beat Walter Cronkite on a story, and as he grew older and more successful, the marvel of it was that he never changed, the wild fires still burned.         
	Walter Leland Cronkite Jr. was born on November 4, 1916, in St Joseph, Montana, the son of Walter Leland Cronkite Sr., a dentist, and the former Helen Lena Fritsche. His ancestors had settled in New Amsterdam, the Dutch colony that became New York. As a boy, Walter peddled magazines door to door and hawked newspapers. As a teenager, after the family had moved to Houston, he got a job with The Houston Post as a copy boy and cub reporter.         
	At the same time, he had a paper route delivering The Post to his neighbours.                            NEW YORK TIMES NEWS SERVICE

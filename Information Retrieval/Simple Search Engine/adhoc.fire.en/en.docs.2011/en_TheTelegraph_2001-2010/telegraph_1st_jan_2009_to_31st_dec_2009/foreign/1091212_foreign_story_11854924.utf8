	Washington, Dec. 11 (AP): A senior state department official said today the US expects Pakistan to deport five young Americans detained after they allegedly sought to join up with terrorist groups.        
	While Pakistani officials have said the men admitted trying to connect with militant groups, an FBI note sent to American lawmakers said the bureau has no information linking them to terrorist organisations.        
	 The state department official said today that it is not yet clear whether the five men may have broken any Pakistani or US laws during their stay in Pakistan. The five allegedly told local investigators they were trying to connect with al Qaida-linked militant groups.

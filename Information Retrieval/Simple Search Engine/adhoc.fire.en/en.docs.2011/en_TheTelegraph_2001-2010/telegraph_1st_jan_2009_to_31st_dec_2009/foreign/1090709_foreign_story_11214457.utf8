The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Cyber raids target White House and NYSE
                                                                                                               Cyber raids target White House and NYSE
                              Assault blunted                            
	Washington, July 8 (AP): The powerful attack that overwhelmed computers at US and South Korean government agencies for days was even broader than initially realised.        
	It also targeting the White House, the defence department and the New York Stock Exchange. Other targets of the attack included the National Security Agency, homeland security department, state department, the Nasdaq stock market and The Washington Post, according to an early analysis of the malicious software used in the attacks.         
	Many of the organisations appeared to successfully blunt the sustained computer assaults.        
	The Associated Press obtained the target list from security experts analysing the attacks. It was not immediately clear who might be responsible or what their motives were. South Korean intelligence officials believe the attacks were carried out by North Korea or pro-Pyongyang forces.        
	The attack was remarkably successful in limiting public access to victim websites, but internal email systems are typically unaffected in such attacks. Some government websites were still reporting problems days after the attack started.

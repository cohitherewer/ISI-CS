	Islamabad, June 14 (Reuters): Pakistan has ordered the military to carry out an offensive against Taliban leader Baitullah Mehsud and his fighters, a provincial governor said today.        
	The announcement came hours after a bomb in a market killed eight people in a northwest Pakistani town, the latest in a wave of attacks since the army launched an offensive against Taliban militants in the Swat Valley.        
	The military and law enforcement agencies have been ordered to carry out a full-fledged operation to eliminate these beasts and killers by using all resources, Awais Ahmed Ghani, governor of North West Frontier Province, told reporters, referring to Mehsud.        
	Earlier today, a bomb planted on a cart in a market in Dera Ismail Khan town killed eight people and wounded 25.        
	Separately, a suspected US drone fired a missile in South Waziristan killing three militants travelling in a vehicle.

	Gaza, Jan. 4: Israeli troops advanced into Gaza today under cover of heavy air, tank and artillery fire after opening a ground war against Hamas yesterday night.        
	The punch across Gaza came on a day the Israeli military announced its first casualty. The Israel army said a soldier, who had been seriously wounded in a mortar shell attack near the Jabalya refugee camp in Gaza yesterday, succumbed to his injuries. Thirty more Israeli soldiers have received injuries in the assault.        
	Witnesses said the Israeli forces had bisected Gazas northern and southern parts, and had taken over certain strategic areas, including what the military has described as rocket launching sites.        
	In a telephone briefing for a group of foreign correspondents, a senior Israeli military official said Israeli troops would hold the areas they have taken inside Gaza at least for the duration of the operation to prevent militants from returning to fire rockets from there.        
	We dont plan to retake the Gaza Strip but there are several places we control now and will control later, he said. If it will be needed, we are prepared to stay there.        
	Even with Israeli forces on the ground, though, Hamas continued its rocket fire. About 25 rockets were launched at southern Israel by today afternoon, the military said.         
	Touring the town some time later, Michael R. Bloomberg, the mayor of New York, had to be rushed into a protected space when Sderots incoming rocket alert sounded.        
	Most of the fighting early today was taking place in northern and eastern Gaza, in areas not far from the Israeli border. But at least five civilians were killed and many wounded today morning when Israeli shells or rockets landed in a market of Gaza City.        
	The Israeli military said they had hit dozens of armed Hamas operatives during exchanges of fire overnight. Hospital officials said at least 42 civilians had been killed by today afternoon and more than 100 wounded since Israeli troops had begun advancing.

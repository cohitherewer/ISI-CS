                                                                                                               Nicole out, Amelie star in for Chanel
                              Tautou                             
	Paris, April 22 (Reuters): Audrey Tautou, star of Amelie, takes to French screens this week as the legendary designer Coco Chanel and, coincidentally or not, also takes over from Nicole Kidman as frontwoman for Chanel Number 5 perfume.                  Kidman     
	Coco avant Chanel, directed by Anne Fontaine, is the latest French biopic to ride the wave created by La vie en rose, which gave Marion Cotillard her Oscar-winning role as the tortured chanteuse Edith Piaf.        
	Coco Chanels personality was absolutely extraordinary but beyond her genius and talent she has everything that the heroine of any great novel has, Tautou told France Inter radio. Tautou has stared out gravely from billboards ahead of the launch of the film, which got warm reviews.

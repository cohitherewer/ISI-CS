The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Putin hails Poland for war bravery
                                                                                                               Putin hails Poland for war bravery

	Moscow, Sept. 1: Prime Minister Vladimir V. Putin, in Poland today to mark the 70th anniversary of the start of World War II, praised Polish soldiers and citizens for their bravery in the war.        
	However, the Russian government unveiled what it said were previously classified documents showing Polish cooperation with Nazi Germany in the years leading up to the war.        
	Putins conciliatory remarks appeared to be aimed at dampening a row between Russia and Poland over each countrys role in the war, a debate that grew heated in the weeks leading up to the wars anniversary.        
	Russia has always respected the bravery and heroism of the Polish people, soldiers, and officers, who stood up first against Nazism in 1939, Putin said in a meeting with his counterpart, Donald Tusk, in the port city of Gdansk.        
	Tusk responded that relations between the two countries had never been better.         
	Many in Poland are angered by what they see as Russias failure to acknowledge atrocities committed by the Soviet Union after its troops occupied eastern Poland just weeks after the Nazis invaded.        
	They split Poland in two parts, Andrzej Halicki, chairman of the Polish Parliaments Foreign Affairs Committee, said by telephone. We were under occupation by Russians and by Germans. Such sentiments have incensed the Russian government, which sees the Soviet Unions role in World War II as that of liberator and not occupier.         
	Russias foreign security Service unveiled archival documents today purporting to show Polish cooperation with Nazi Germany ahead of World War II. Without a doubt, a portion of the blame for unleashing World War II lies with Poland, which is why they are attempting to distort historical fact, Lev F. Sotskov, a major general in the Foreign Security Service, said at a press conference in Moscow.        
	In Poland, however, Putin seemed to step back from the debate. History is complex and is not painted just one colour, he said.         
	He had said as much in a lengthy article published yesterday in the Polish newspaper, Gazeta Wyborcza, characterising the Nazi-Soviet pact to divide Poland at the outset of World War II in 1939 as immoral, but he stressed that it was just one of a series of such deals that countries struck with the Nazis at that time.                            NEW YORK TIMES NEWS SERVICE

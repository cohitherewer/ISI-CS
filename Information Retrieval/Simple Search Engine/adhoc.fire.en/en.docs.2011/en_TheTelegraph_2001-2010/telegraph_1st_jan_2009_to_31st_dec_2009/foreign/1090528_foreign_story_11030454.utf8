	Locked with cats    
	 Moscow, May 27: A feral girl who has spent her entire life shut up in a flat in the company of cats and dogs has been taken into care by police in Siberia, reports The Times.       
	The child, 5, was unable to speak and acted like a dog when officers discovered her locked in a squalid, unheated flat in the city of Chita.       
	For five years, the girl was brought up by several dogs and cats and had never been outside, police said in a statement. The unwashed girl was dressed in filthy clothes and had the clear attributes of an animal.       
	Police said that the girl had had a lack of contact with humans, despite sharing the three-room flat with her father, grandparents and other relatives.

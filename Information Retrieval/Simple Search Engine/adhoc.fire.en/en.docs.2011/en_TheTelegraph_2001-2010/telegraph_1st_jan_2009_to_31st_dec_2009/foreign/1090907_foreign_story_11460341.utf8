	Thurman wedding    
	 London, Sept. 6 (PTI): Actress Uma Thurman and her millionaire fiance Arpad Busson have booked Kensington Palace, the former residence of the late Princess Diana of Britain, for their marriage ceremony.       
	Thurman, 39, and Busson, 46, are set to tie the knot in June next year.       
	Uma wants to get married like a princess. She already has an eight-carat diamond ring and now she is planning to get married in a palace, a friend close to Thurman said. The couple have hired the entire palace to ensure complete privacy, the friend added.     
	Penn friend    
	 London (PTI): Actor Sean Penn, who split from his actress wife Robin Wright just weeks ago, has already moved on to another woman. The Milk star, whose wife of 12 years filed for divorce last month, was seen enjoying a romantic dinner date with a woman at a London hotel, Contactmusic reported. The two were spotted laughing and joking with Penn even feeding his date from his plate.

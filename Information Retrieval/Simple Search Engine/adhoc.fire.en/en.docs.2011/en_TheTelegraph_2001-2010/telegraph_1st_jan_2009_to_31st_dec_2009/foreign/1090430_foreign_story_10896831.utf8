The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Pak takes key Buner town

	Islamabad, April 29: After a week of strong criticism here and abroad over its inaction, the Pakistani military claimed today to have reasserted control of Daggar, a key town just 100km from the capital in Buner, a strategically important district overrun by hundreds of Taliban militants last week.        
	The development came one day after the military deployed fighter jets and helicopter gunships against the insurgents. It was not immediately clear what level of resistance the Taliban had offered.        
	Pakistan also agreed to move 6,000 troops from its Indian border to fight militants on its western border with Afghanistan, according to a Pakistani official who requested anonymity to discuss troop movements in advance.        
	American officials welcomed the redeployment but said Pakistan was still not doing enough to fight the insurgents, who are tightening their hold on the country. The Americans expressed frustration that Pakistan was still rebuffing their offers to train more Pakistanis to fight al Qaida and the Taliban.        
	Major General Athar Abbas, a military spokesman, said that government forces had reasserted control of Buner by 8am today. One member of a government security force and two others were injured in the operation, and more than 50 militants were killed, he said.        
	We are facing stiff resistance in the area of Amabala, Abbas said, referring to a part of Buner. Our constraint, he said, is that we are launching an operation in an area where militants have held local population hostage. We are trying to ensure there is minimum collateral damage and minimum displacement of local people. General Abbas said he expected the operation to continue for at least a week.

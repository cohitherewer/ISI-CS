                                                                                                               Mehsud escapes drone raid
                            
	Wana (Pakistan), June 24 (Reuters): US drones prowled the sky over Pakistans South Waziristan today after one of the aircraft attacked a stronghold of Pakistani Taliban leader Baitullah Mehsud, killing about 47 militants.        
	The drones yesterday fired three missiles at a Taliban training centre near the village of Makeen, 60km from Waziristans main town of Wana, killing seven militants. Another barrage of seven missiles hit the same area at a funeral procession for some of those killed in the first attack.        
	 Over 40 militants were killed in the second raid.        
	 Earlier, local officials were quoted by TV channels as saying that Baitullah Mehsud was at the funeral. Media reports said that he may have narrowly escaped the drone attack.        
	 Local officials suggested that militants had lost contact with Mehsud for a while after the attack. But, media reports today, while confirming that Mehsud had visited the village where the funeral took place, said the the militants leader left before the second attack.        
	 Hundreds of top ranking Taliban leaders attended the funeral and their presence indicated that the first drone attack had taken out a high-value target.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Searing reminders jut out of Italy rubble

	LAquila (Italy), April 7 (Reuters): The death toll from a devastating earthquake in central Italy rose to 207 today and aftershocks hampered the race to dig possible survivors out of the debris.        
	Rescuers worked under floodlights through the night and thousands of people whose homes were wrecked sheltered in tents and cars. The hope of finding anyone under the rubble now is very small, said a civil protection agency official at a camp set up outside LAquila, the historic mountain city shattered by the quake.        
	Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi said 207 people were now confirmed as dead in the worst quake to strike Italy in 30 years. Of some 1,500 people injured, about 100 were in serious condition.        
	The new aftershocks struck fear into people, with residents running out of tents screaming and crying after a particularly strong tremor. Buildings shook and masonry fell onto the streets but no new injuries were reported.        
	We advise people not to go back into their homes, Berlusconi told a news conference in LAquila, adding that rescue efforts to find people still alive will go on for at least two more days.        
	An aftershock today which hit at about 0926GMT and registered magnitude 4.7, was felt as far away as Rome, where furniture swayed on the upper floors of buildings. The estimated number of homeless was revised to 17,000 from a previous 50,000 and the number of missing was under 50.        
	The quake turned a picturesque, close-knit community into a saddened town populated by a few numbed survivors.        
	Some stumbled around, dazed, carrying a few prized possessions. Others wept or stared at heart-wrenching items jutting out of a pile of rubble three stories high: a childs shattered guitar, a little girls play stroller -- and a bloodstained mattress.        
	Its so awful, Maria Rita Colaianni, 34, said, clutching a gold-embossed vase she recovered from the wreckage of her pancaked home in the heart of the quake zone. It seems like all the young people are the ones who died, said Colaianni, who - together with her parents and a brother - escaped with their lives. Her next-door neighbours all died, including a 6-year-old and an 8-year-old.        
	Shows of solidarity came from home and abroad. Italian soccer teams said revenue from this weekends matches would be sent to help victims. Universities and newspapers throughout the country took collections. Officials said the quake would severely affect the regions economy, much of which is based on tourism, agriculture and small, family-run businesses.        
	 A camp was set up on a sports field outside medieval LAquila but there were not enough tents and most people spent the night in their cars as temperatures in the mountainous, windy area hovered near freezing.        
	I cant even bear to think of the future, said Angela Camon, 37, who spent the night in a tent with her husband and a bible. There is nothing to go back to.        
	Berlusconi, who has declared a national emergency, visited LAquila again to survey the damage and promised residents the government will help them rebuild their homes.         
	Rescuers and volunteers working by the glare of floodlight and using mechanical diggers and their bare hands searched through the night for survivors. Sniffer dogs aided the hunt.

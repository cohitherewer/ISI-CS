The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Five dead in ethnic protests in China
                                                                                                               Five dead in ethnic protests in China

	Beijing, Sept. 4 The capital of the western Chinese region of Xinjiang remained paralysed today as ethnic Han protesters continued to rally to call for a clampdown on Uighurs, causing the government to close schools, offices and shops to keep people off the streets and to block traffic from the city centre.         
	However, according to the deputy mayor of Urumqi, Zhang Hong, five people have died in the unrest this week. Among the dead, two had been confirmed as innocent civilians, while police were investigating circumstances of the others deaths.        
	The police used tear gas to disperse protesters, and loud booms from the firing of gas canisters could be heard from the city centre, witnesses said.        
	Helicopters were seen overhead in the morning in Urumqi, one day after tens of thousands of Han, the dominant ethnic group in China, took to the streets to demand that the government prevent alleged hypodermic needle stabbings by Uighurs, a Turkic-speaking people who are largely Muslim, according to a report by Xinhua, the state news agency.        
	The Han said the needles were infected with HIV. The Xinhua report said more than 476 people had reported stab wounds in recent days, and 89 of those had been treated for actual injuries by health workers, but none had shown symptoms of infectious diseases.        
	Groups of protesters continued to gather in front of the offices of the regional government to demand the resignation of Wang Lequan, the top communist party official in Xinjiang, an oil-rich and ethnically fractious region that makes up one-sixth of China. The Han protesters said Wang had failed to make the city safe for Han residents after mobs of Uighurs went on a rampage on July 5, beating and killing scores of civilians.        
	Wang, a proponent of hard-line ethnic minority policies who has ruled Xinjiang for 15 years, is a member of the ruling Politburo, and the outcry against him is a rare attack on a member of the countrys governing elite.        
	The rioting on July 5 was the deadliest outbreak of ethnic violence in China in decades, leaving at least 197 people dead and 1,721 wounded, according to government statistics. That initial riot began after police officers clashed with Uighurs who were protesting the governments handling of an earlier ethnic brawl in southern China.        
	The violence brought to the surface the malice and resentment that have long coursed through society in Xinjiang. Uighurs complain that the ruling Han oppress them in a variety of ways; Han say the Uighurs are ungrateful for the benefits that Han governance has brought to the region.        
	In the days after the July outburst of Uighur anger in Urumqi, Han vigilantes went into Uighur neighbourhoods to take revenge. The government has not said how many Uighurs were killed or wounded in these attacks.        
	Security forces have been deployed in large numbers throughout parts of Urumqi since that spate of violence. Yet talk of the needle attacks spread quickly in recent days, fuelled by official news reports on the assaults.

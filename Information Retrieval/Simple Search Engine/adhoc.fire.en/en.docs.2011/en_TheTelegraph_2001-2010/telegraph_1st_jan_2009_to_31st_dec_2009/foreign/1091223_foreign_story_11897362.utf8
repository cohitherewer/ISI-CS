The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Lahore justice: a nose for a nose
                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      Lahore justice: a nose for a nose
                            
	Lahore, Dec. 22 (Reuters): A Pakistani court has ordered that two brothers should have their noses and ears cut off after they were found guilty of doing the same to a woman who refused to marry one of them, a government prosecutor said today.        
	The judge at an anti-terrorism court in Lahore handed down the sentences yesterday in line with the Islamic law of Qisas. The law was introduced in Pakistan during the military rule of General Mohammad Zia-ul-Haq in 1979. It stipulates punishment equal to the crime, akin to an eye-for-an-eye, unless the culprit is pardoned by the victim.        
	The two brothers, Sher Mohammad and Amanat Ali, abducted their cousin, Fazeelat Bibi, at gunpoint in September after her father refused to let her marry Mohammad. They put a noose around her neck and tried to strangle her. After failing to do so, Sher Mohammad chopped off her nose and two ears with a knife, the prosecutor said.

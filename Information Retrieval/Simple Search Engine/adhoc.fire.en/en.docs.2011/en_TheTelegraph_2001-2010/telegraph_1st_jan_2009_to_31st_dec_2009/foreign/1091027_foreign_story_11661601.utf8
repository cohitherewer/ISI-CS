	Seoul, Oct. 26 (AP): A disgraced cloning expert, who falsely claimed major breakthroughs in stem cell research, was convicted today for embezzlement and other charges connected to the scandal. However, he will not serve time in prison.        
	Hwang Woo-suk, 56  once considered a national hero in South Korea for his work on stem cells and for producing the worlds first cloned dog, Snuppy  was cleared of the main charge of fraud but was convicted of embezzling research funds and illegally buying human eggs for his research.        
	Prosecutors had asked for four years in prison, but Judge Bae Ki-yeol of Seoul Central District Court said Hwang had shown remorse and gave him a suspended sentence, sparing him jail time if he stays out of trouble for three years.

	Islamabad, April 10 (PTI): The Pakistan capital was on red alert today as the US embassy, the UN and the World Bank suspended operations after Taliban commander Baitullah Mehsud threatened to carry out suicide attacks in the city, interior ministry chief Rehman Malik said.         
	The threat forced almost all private schools in the city to shut this morning even though there were no specific threats against schools.         
	Security was beefed up at the presidency, Prime Ministers House, the parliament, government offices, diplomatic missions and residences of diplomats, he said.         
	Extra police personnel and the Pakistan Rangers have been deployed to guard key installations, Malik told the Dawn News channel.         
	Security has also been tightened at the police headquarters and offices of intelligence agencies, which have been targeted by suicide bombers in the past.         
	Tehrik-e-Taliban Pakistan chief Baitullah Mehsud had recently threatened to carry out two suicide attacks a week to avenge the US drone attacks in the countrys tribal areas.         
	He also claimed responsibility for the terrorist siege of a police academy near Lahore and a suicide attack on a Special Branch office in Islamabad. The US embassy today suspended visa and consular services due to heightened security, a spokesperson said.         
	He added that the services were expected to resume on Monday. The official did not give any details, but the move could be linked to strict security arrangements for Good Friday.         
	Lahore shooting        
	Guards fired in the air at the police academy near Lahore that was the target of a terrorist siege last month.         
	Senior police officials who rushed to the Manawan training centre on Lahores outskirts said the guards had fired in the air on seeing a suspicious man.

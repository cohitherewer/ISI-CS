The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Berry hopes to kick up a better Storm
                                                                                                               Berry hopes to kick up a better Storm
          SAUL HANSELL AND IAN AUSTEN                          A BlackBerry Storm                                  
	New York, Oct. 14: The BlackBerry Storm was supposed to be the smartphone that would keep American customers from deserting to Apples iPhone.        
	But the Storm failed to live up to its name. About a million devices were sold, so it was not a flop. But many customers and some reviewers found it buggy and hard to use.        
	Meanwhile, the iPhones allure grew with new versions and a rapidly growing catalogue of applications.         
	This week, Research In Motion (RIM), the company that created the BlackBerry phones that business users find so addictive, is trying again with Storm 2.         
	Among its many improvements, the new phone gives the user the sensation of pushing a physical button when pressing a number on the glass touch screen.        
	Lowell C. McAdam, the chief executive of Verizon Wireless, has been carrying the revamped device for a few weeks. McAdam said that while he was recently visiting a store in New York, he started talking to a couple of college students who were shopping for mobile phones.        
	I let them play with the second-generation Storm device, he said. They came back and said: Oh, my gosh. They were very excited. This is what they hoped the original Storm should be.        
	If enough people share that opinion, RIM could finally have the hit with consumers it has long sought.         
	The Canadian company remains the top seller of smartphones in North America (and second to Nokia worldwide). But Apple is catching up quickly.        
	RIM has been slow to develop touch-screen technology, and its BlackBerrys are sluggish at browsing the Internet, analysts say. Developers have written only about 2,000 applications to run on BlackBerrys, compared with 85,000 for the iPhone.         
	Investors are worried that RIM cannot keep up with the pace of innovation.        
	Despite its consumer push, much of RIMs effort is still tilted to pleasing business customers.        
	Jim Balsillie, RIMs co-chief executive, said the company planned to shake up the market in November when it will open its private communication network, which will allow BlackBerry users to receive their e-mail and a constant flow of social network updates and entertainment content from other sources.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Biden sets new foreign policy tone

	Munich, Feb. 7 (Reuters): Vice-President Joe Biden announced changes to US foreign policy today that emphasised diplomacy over military power but also urged allies to shoulder more of the burden in tackling global crises.        
	I come to Europe on behalf of a new administration determined to set a new tone in Washington, and in Americas relations around the world, Biden told a security conference in Munich.        
	We will engage. We will listen. We will consult. America needs the world, just as I believe the world needs America. Delivering the Obama administrations first major foreign policy speech, Biden effectively repudiated former President George W. Bushs with us or against us foreign policy. Bidens speech also tried to turn the page on the 2003 US-led invasion of Iraq that alienated many Europeans.        
	But, Biden made clear the US was still prepared to use military force to protect its national security. There is no conflict between our security and our ideals. They are mutually reinforcing. The force of arms won our independence, and throughout our history, the force of arms has protected our freedom.

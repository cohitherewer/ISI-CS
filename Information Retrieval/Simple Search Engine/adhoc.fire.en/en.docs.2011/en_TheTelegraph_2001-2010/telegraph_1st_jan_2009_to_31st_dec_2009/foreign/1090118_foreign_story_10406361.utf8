The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Israel to end Gaza campaign
                                                                                                               Israel to end Gaza campaign
                            
	Gaza, Jan. 17 (Reuters): Israel plans to halt its Gaza offensive without any deal with Hamas, an Israeli official said today, in an apparent effort to deny the Islamist group any gains from the three-week-old conflict.        
	Hamas leaders in exile have vowed to fight on, but many of the 1.5 million Palestinians enduring incessant bombardment and privation in Gaza seemed desperate for their ordeal to end.        
	The goal is to announce, subject to cabinet approval, a suspension of military activities because we believe our goals have been attained, said the official, asking not to be named. The security cabinet met shortly before 1800GMT.         
	Reporting on the start of the meeting, Israels Channel 10 television said the military commander had recommended concluding the campaign.

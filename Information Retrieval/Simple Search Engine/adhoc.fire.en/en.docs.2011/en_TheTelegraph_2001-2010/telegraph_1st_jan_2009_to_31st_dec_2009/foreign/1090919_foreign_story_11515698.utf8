	Kohat (Pakistan), Sept. 18 (Reuters): A suicide car-bomber killed 33 people in northwest Pakistan today in an explosion on a road that brought down shops where people were stocking up before Id-ul-Fitr.        
	The bomb went off on a main road near the city of Kohat, 150km southwest of Islamabad, and brought down some roadside shops, police and witnesses said.        
	A restaurant and many shops have collapsed. Its chaos here. Theres huge devastation, said Ibn-e-Ali, a former judge and resident of the area. My house is one kilometre away, but the blast was so huge it felt as if it was next door.        
	A police spokesman said 33 people had been killed and about 80 wounded. The bomb was believed to have contained about 150kg of explosives, police said. Kohat is a garrison town, close to the lawless ethnic Pashtun tribal belt on the Afghan border, a major sanctuary for militants.

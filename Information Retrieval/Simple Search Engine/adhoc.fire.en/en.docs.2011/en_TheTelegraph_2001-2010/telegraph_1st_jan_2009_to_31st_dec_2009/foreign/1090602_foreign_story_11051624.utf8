The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Taliban take 400 captive
                                                                                                               Taliban take 400 captive
                            
	Islamabad, June 1 (AP): Taliban militants armed with rockets, grenades and automatic weapons abducted at least 400 students, staff and relatives driving away from a boys school in a northwest Pakistani tribal region today, police and a witness said.        
	The brazen abduction came amid rising militant violence in Pakistans tribal belt  actions the military says are partly aimed at distracting it from its offensive against the Taliban in the nearby Swat Valley.        
	The police were negotiating with the Taliban via tribal elders to release the captives taken in North Waziristan, said Mirza Mohammad Jihadi, an adviser to the Prime Minister. He said the captives were being held in the Bakka Khel area.        
	Police officer Meer Sardar said the abduction occurred about 30km from Razmak Cadet College in North Waziristan. The people were leaving the school area after they were warned to get out in a phone call from a man they believed to be a political official, Sardar said, citing accounts from a group of 17 who managed to get away.        
	Local media, however, reported that the group was leaving because their vacation had started.        
	Around 30 buses, cars and other vehicles were carrying the students, staff and others when they were stopped along the road by a large group of alleged militants in their own vehicles, according to a staff member at the school who was among those who escaped.         
	The vehicle he was travelling in happened to be behind a truck on the road, and it was less visible, so the driver slipped away.        
	He said the schools principal was among those abducted.        
	The staff member said the assailants carried rockets, Kalashnikovs, hand grenades and other weapons. He estimated around 400 captives were involved.        
	It was unclear how many were students, though they made up the majority of the group. Cadet colleges in Pakistan are usually run by retired military officers and educate teenagers.         
	Late today, reports were coming in that at least one other bus managed to get away and reach a police station. Jihadi said at least 29 students escaped, apparently in addition to the 17 at Sardars police station in the Marian area.

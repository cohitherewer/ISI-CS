                                                                                                               Google puts planets blue heart within reach
  - OCEAN TO EXPLORE MARINE LIFE          URMEE KHAN                          Explorer Sylvia Earle exults as the first ocean image is shown on Google Earth in San Francisco. (AP)                                        
	Google has launched an extention of Google Earth, which will allow Web users to virtually explore the ocean with thousands of images of underwater landscapes.         
	Google Ocean, which will be included in the newest version of Google Earth, will allow users to swim around underwater volcanoes, watch videos about exotic marine life, read about nearby shipwrecks, contribute photos and watch unseen footage of historic ocean expeditions  all from the comfort of their homes. Footage of polar bears, beluga whales, sea urchins and king penguins from the BBCs award winning series Planet Earth and The Blue Planet will also be available.         
	The worlds oceans cover more than 70 per cent of the planets surface and contain 80 per cent of all life on Earth.         
	Google Earth, which combines satellite imagery, maps and information to allow users to explore streets and cities around the world, has been downloaded 500 million times since it was introduced in 2005. Google Ocean was developed with an advisory council of more than 25 leading ocean advocates and scientists.         
	Pen Hadow, the artic explorer and director of Catlin Arctic Survey, told The Daily Telegraph: This is a watershed moment of shared global understanding of our oceans. My passion for the Arctic Ocean is matched only by the urgency of our need to understand how it works within the global Earth system. Ocean in Google Earth will enable a global audience to follow the progress and findings of the Catlin Arctic Survey, an international scientific endeavour.         
	Sylvia Earle, oceanographer and Explorer in Residence at the National Geographic Society, said: I cannot imagine a more effective way to inspire awareness and caring for the blue heart of the planet than the new Ocean in Google Earth.

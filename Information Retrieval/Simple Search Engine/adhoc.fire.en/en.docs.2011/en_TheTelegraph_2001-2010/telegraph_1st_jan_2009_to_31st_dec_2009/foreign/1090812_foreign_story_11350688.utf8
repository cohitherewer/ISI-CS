The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Ban good wishes for Iran chief
                                                                                                               Ban good wishes for Iran chief
                            
	United Nations, Aug. 11 (Reuters): The UN today said secretary-general Ban Ki-moon had congratulated Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, whose re-election as Iran President sparked violent protests across the country.        
	The letter went out yesterday, UN spokesperson Marie Okabe said.        
	Irans June 12 election plunged the country into its biggest internal crisis since the 1979 Islamic Revolution, setting off a wave of protests that left 26 people dead.        
	Western leaders refused to congratulate the President on his inauguration last week, although their counterparts in Japan and Turkey did so.        
	Among those leaders who withheld their congratulations to Ahmadinejad were US President Barack Obama, British Prime Minister Gordon Brown, French President Nicolas Sarkozy and German Chancellor Angela Merkel.        
	The UN spokesperson said Bans letter was a customary letter on the occasion of the inauguration but added that the text would not be made public. The secretary-general routinely congratulates leaders after elections and the UN has released the content of some of those messages in the past.

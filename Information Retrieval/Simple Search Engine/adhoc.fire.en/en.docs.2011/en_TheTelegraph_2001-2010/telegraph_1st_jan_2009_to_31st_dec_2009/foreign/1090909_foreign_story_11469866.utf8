The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Shh! Quietest room is now open
                                                                                                               Shh! Quietest room is now open
                            
	London, Sept. 8: The worlds quietest room opened its doors for the study of nanotechnology in Bristol.        
	The ultra-low vibration suite, which cost 11 million, allows scientists to manipulate atoms and molecules without the interference of environmental vibrations interrupting their work.        
	There is virtually no air movement inside the cutting edge laboratory, which is anchored to the rock foundation in the basement of the Nanoscience and Quantum Information Centre in Bristol.The buildings architecture prevents the penetration of echo and sound waves inside the building, despite its location in the Bristol city centre.        
	Its exterior panels are made from self-cleaning glass, that uses nano-particles to break down dirt.        
	The centre will be used for a range of experiments, from looking for solutions to greener power production to better ways to battle cancer.        
	Architects Willmott Dixon South West and Wales designed and built the centre for the University of Bristol.        
	Managing director Neal Stephens said: Due to the stringent and exacting nature of nanoscience, the new facility had to meet the most detailed constraints for vibration and acoustics.

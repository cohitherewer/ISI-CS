The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Delhis response to Kabul events: silence

	Washington, Oct. 21: Less than two weeks after the Indian embassy in Kabul was attacked for a second time in 15 months, it is back to complacency and business as usual in New Delhi.        
	India was almost alone yesterday in responding with deafening silence to a turning point in Afghanistans volatile politics: President Hamid Karzais acquiescence for a second round of voting in the controversial elections on another term for himself in office.        
	Within minutes of Karzais agreement to go along with the findings of poll fraud by the Independent Election Commission (IEC) and the Electoral Complaints Commission (ECC) in Afghanistan, which put the Presidents vote tally below the mandatory 50 per cent, British Prime Minister Gordon Brown said of the two main candidates who will take part in the run-off.        
	I congratulate President Karzai on the strong support he has secured from across his nation and from all ethnic groups. And I congratulate Dr (Abdullah) Abdullah on achieving a high level of support.        
	UN secretary-general Ban Ki-moon, vindicated by a process that reached its conclusion yesterday, said the UN has supported the work of these institutions (IEC and ECC) in their efforts to ensure that all valid votes cast in the elections of 20 August 2009 were taken into account and that the voice of the Afghan people was clearly heard.        
	He reiterated his rejection of a backdoor coup detat by former American diplomat Peter Galbraith (whom Ban fired from the UN) by reducing the number of polling stations ostensibly to prevent fraud but aimed in reality at regime change in Kabul.        
	That was not acceptable, just to deprive the right of the Afghan people for voting was not acceptable in terms of the core values of democracy, the UN secretary-general added.        
	In Paris, French foreign minister Bernard Kouchner revealed that I spoke to him (Karzai)...yesterday and the day before, several times... Mr Karzai will be elected  he is elected. But having a second round seems very important to me because it is proof of democracy. The fact that Afghanistan is more clearly taking the democratic path is a good thing.        
	Of course, in Washington president Barack Obama said even as the Afghan President conveyed his resolution of the election stand-off that President Karzais constructive actions established an important precedent for Afghanistans new democracy.         
	The Afghan Constitution and laws are strengthened by president Karzais decision, which is in the best interests of the Afghan people.        
	But in the worlds largest democracy next door to Afghanistan, a country in which India has vital stakes that affect the lives and security of its own people, it was as if nothing was happening in Kabul. The last statement that India made on the political process in Afghanistan, which will have a bearing on Indias long-term domestic security, was more than a month ago, on September 19 to be precise, welcoming the successful holding of the presidential and provincial council elections in Afghanistan.        
	Instead of being proactive on a key neighbourhood development, much of the Indian government busied itself yesterday to ceremonially see off the first batch of people making the Haj pilgrimage to Saudi Arabia.        
	External affairs minister S.M. Krishna was there, Delhi chief minister Sheila Dixit was in attendance, so were two members of her cabinet, the secretary (east) in South Block, N. Ravi and a host of officials who formed a sizeable segment of the Indian government.        
	Krishna made a long speech which had 10 salient points that dwelt on Muslims and Muslim countries as well as Indian presence in a key area of the Islamic world, but not a word was said about the march of democracy in a neighbouring Muslim country, which impacts on India.        
	Obama could not have got away with it during a public appearance on a newsy day like this. Nor could Brown, Ban or Kouchner. Only in India does the government bury its head in the sand when its vital diplomatic assets are at stake in its very backyard.        
	An Indian official offered the excuse that it all happened in Kabul late in the night. But the developments in Kabul did not take place overnight. They have been in the making for weeks and New Delhi should have been prepared.        
	Twenty four hours later, at the time of going to the press, Indias response was still: silence.

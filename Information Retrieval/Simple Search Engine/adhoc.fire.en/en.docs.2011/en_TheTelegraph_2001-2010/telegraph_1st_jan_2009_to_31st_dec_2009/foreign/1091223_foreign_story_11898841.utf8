	Kathmandu, Dec. 22 (Agencies): Maoist chief and former Prime Minister Prachanda today blamed Indias naked interference for the political crisis in Nepal.        
	The former rebels gave the government till January 24 to pave the way for a unity government headed by them or face an indefinite countrywide shutdown.        
	Addressing a massive rally in the heart of Kathmandu on the final day of a three-day general strike, Prachanda said: Unless a national government is formed by January 24, we will be forced to impose an indefinite strike, Prachanda told his supporters. Well create a storm of mass protests which will sweep the government away, he said.        
	Blaming India, Prachanda said he will only talk to New Delhi and not to the puppet government in Kathmandu.        
	Prachanda said his party is ready to hold decisive talks with the masters (India) and not the current puppet government to resolve the current political deadlock in the country.         
	Prachanda objected to Indian army chief General Deepak Kapoors reported statement opposing en masse integration of politically indoctrinated former rebels into the Nepal army. Who gave him (Kapoor) the right to speak against the Comprehensive Peace Agreement? Prachanda said. What can be more shameful and more insulting to the Nepali people?

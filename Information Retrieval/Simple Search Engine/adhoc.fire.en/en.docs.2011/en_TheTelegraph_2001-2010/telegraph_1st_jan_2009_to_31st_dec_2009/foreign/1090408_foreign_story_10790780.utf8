	Switch to itch    
	 Chicago, April 7 (Reuters): Scratching an itchy spot turns off an itch switch in the spinal cord, US researchers said today in a finding they think could lead to better treatments for itching disorders.      
	Tests on monkeys showed that scratching shortcircuits itch signals to the brain. Understanding how this works may lead to new treatments for people with diseases such as AIDS or Hodgkins disease that cause itching not easily relieved by antihistamines or steroid creams.      
	There are more than 50 diseases that produce itch that cant be easily treated, Glenn Giesler Jr. of the University of Minnesota, whose study appears in the journal Nature Neuroscience, said.      
	 earlier studies, he and colleagues showed that neurons in a special part of the spinal cord known as the spinothalamic tract become very active when itchy substances are put on the skin. Giesler said itch sensations  which are a form of pain signal  are sent to a region of the brain known as the thalamus.     
	Cold copy    
	 Los Angeles (AP): Coldplay has denied in federal court that it copied parts of Joe Satrianis music for its hit song, Viva La Vida. In a response filed in Los Angeles on Monday, attorneys for Coldplays band members also argued that any similarities between Viva La Vida and Satrianis If I Could Fly werent enough to warrant damages. Satrianis song lacks originality, Coldplays response claims, and shouldnt receive copyright protection. Satriani sued Coldplay in December.    
	Rubble cat    
	 Berlin (Reuters): A cat named Felix was found alive and well beneath the rubble of a six-storey building in Cologne that collapsed five weeks ago, the fire brigade in German city said on Tuesday. The 12-year-old cat was in surprisingly good health, authorities said. He was found beneath the city archives building that collapsed on March 3.      
	Rescue workers were clearing away the rubble from the ruins, in which two people were killed, when they spotted a pair of small paws.      
	The men lifted some concrete blocks when suddenly a little cat came to light, said Dietmar Paust, fire brigade spokesman.

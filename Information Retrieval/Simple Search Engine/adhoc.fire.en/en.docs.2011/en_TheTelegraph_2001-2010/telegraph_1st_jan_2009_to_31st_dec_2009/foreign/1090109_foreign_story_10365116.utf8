	Gaza City, Jan. 8 (AP): The UN halted aid deliveries to the besieged Gaza Strip today, citing Israeli attacks on its staff and installations hours after it said gunfire from an Israeli tank killed one of its drivers as he was picking up a shipment.        
	For a second straight day, Israel suspended its Gaza military operation for three hours to allow in humanitarian supplies. Shortly before the pause took effect, however, the UN said one of its aid trucks came under Israeli fire, killing the driver.         
	UN spokesman Adnan Abu Hasna said the UN coordinated the delivery with Israel, and the vehicle was marked with a UN flag and insignia when it was shot in northern Gaza.

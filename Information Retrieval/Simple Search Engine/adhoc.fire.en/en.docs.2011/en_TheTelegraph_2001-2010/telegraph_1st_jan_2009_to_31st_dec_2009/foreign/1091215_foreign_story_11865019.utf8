          NASIR JAFFRY                               
	Islamabad, Dec 14: A Pakistani court on Monday ordered the government not to deport five American men, as the investigators make frantic to get to network of people, who invited these boys to Pakistan.         
	 quot;The government should submit a detailed report to the court on these detentions on December 17, quot; chief justice Lahore high court Khwaja Muhammad Sharif said in a short order issued on a peition filed by chief of the Defence of Human Rights group, Khalid Khwaja.         
	He asked advocate general Punjab to come up with the comprehensive report and directed the federal and provincial government agencies not to hand over these detainee to FBI.         
	He said the detainees should also not be deported to any other country until a final decision on the petition.         
	The five men from the Washington suburbs, who disappeared late last month, were detained in Pakistan last week in a police raid on a house linked to militant group in Sargodha town         
	Jaish-e-Mohammed leader Khalid Chaudhry, who himself holds American passport and also happens to be the father of two Pakistani American boys aged 19-20 years was arrested for providing shelter to the five foreigners.         
	Jaish-e-Mohammad, which was banned by former military ruler Pervez Musharraf in 2002 operates in Indian-controlled and it has carried out several attacks there. The group was formed after supporters of Maulana Masood Azhar parted ways from another Islamist militant organisation, Harkat-ul-Mujahideen. Azhar is wanted in India over the hijacking of an Indian airliner in 1999.         
	Investigators have identified the man, known as Saifullah, as a recruiter for the Pakistani Taliban and said he contacted one of the American men on YouTube, exchanged coded e-mails with the group, invited them to Pakistan and guided them once they arrived.         
	The five men, who were shifted to Lahore for further interrogation, were planning to go to Waziristan, the Taliban heartland, to join militants, when they were arrested last Wednesday, an official said.

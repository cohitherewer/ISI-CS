	London, Dec. 9: The actress Uma Thurman has reportedly broken off her engagement to French billionaire Arki Busson, ending their relationship of two-and-a-half years.        
	Thurman, 39, and Busson, 47, are believed to have called off the engagement around two months ago, but a source close to the couple says that the pair have remained friends.        
	The couple began dating in 2007. Last year Busson, the chairman and founder of investment firm EIM, proposed to Thurman with an eight-plus diamond ring. The strain of keeping up a long-distance relationship contributed to the split.

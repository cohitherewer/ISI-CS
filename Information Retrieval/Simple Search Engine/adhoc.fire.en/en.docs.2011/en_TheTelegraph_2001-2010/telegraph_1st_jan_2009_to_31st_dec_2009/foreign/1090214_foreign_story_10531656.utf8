The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Senator out of Obama team
                                                                                                               Senator out of Obama team
          JEFF ZELENY                          Gregg                                  
	Washington, Feb. 13: Senator Judd Gregg of New Hampshire abruptly withdrew yesterday as the nominee for commerce secretary, saying he had irresolvable conflicts with President Obama over his economic stimulus plan.        
	He also voiced concern over what many fellow Republicans believe is the politicisation of the 2010 census.        
	The departure of Gregg is the latest setback to a White House that has struggled to fill several top positions and to fulfil Obamas pledge of building a bipartisan administration. He is the third prospective cabinet secretary to remove his name from consideration.        
	Im a fiscal conservative, as everybody knows, a fairly strong one, Gregg told reporters at a news conference in the Capitol. And it just became clear to me that it would be very difficult, day in and day out, to serve in this cabinet or any cabinet. It was my mistake, obviously, to say yes, he added.        
	But the political fallout is left to the White House, which now has a string of appointees who have stepped aside over vetting problems, unpaid taxes or philosophical differences with Obama.         
	Gregg said he alerted Obama to his decision several days ago, but administration officials said the senators withdrawal had taken them off guard.         
	Obama, travelling in Illinois, told reporters that he had spoken to Gregg on Wednesday but that he did not know he planned to withdraw until yesterday.

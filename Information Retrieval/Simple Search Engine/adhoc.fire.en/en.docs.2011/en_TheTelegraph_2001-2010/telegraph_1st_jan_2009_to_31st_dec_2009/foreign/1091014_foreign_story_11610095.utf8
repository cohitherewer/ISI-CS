                                                                                                               Al Pacino traded sex for shelter
                            
	New York, Oct. 13 (PTI): Actor Al Pacino has revealed that he had to trade his body for shelter and food in Sicily, Italy, as he struggled to make his mark as an actor.         
	Pacino, who has acted in films like The Godfather and The Scent of a Woman, spent some time in Sicily in 1960 after dropping out of school to pursue his dream of becoming an actor.        
	However, he struggled to make ends meet and decided to sell his body to an older woman to keep a roof over his head, reports the New York Post. At 20, I lived in Sicily by selling the only asset I had, my body. An older woman traded food and housing in return for sex. I woke mornings not really loving myself, he said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Bittersweet honour for Ledger
                                                                                                               Bittersweet honour for Ledger
          REED JOHNSON                              
	Los Angeles, Feb. 23: Accompanied by a standing ovation and a reverent silence, Heath Ledgers family accepted the supporting actor statuette.        
	The 28-year-old Australian actor, who died after being found unconscious last January in his New York apartment, was posthumously honoured for his toxic performance as the gleefully malicious Joker in the Batman saga The Dark Knight. Menacing, mercurial, droll and diabolical, co-presenter Kevin Kline summarised as he listed Ledger, felled by an accidental overdose of prescription drugs, among the supporting actor nominees.        
	The actors father, Kim Ledger; mother, Sally Bell; and sister Kate Ledger jointly accepted the award. This award tonight would have humbly validated Heaths quiet determination to be truly accepted by you all here, his peers, within an industry he so loved, Kim Ledger said.        
	Kate Ledger said the family was accepting the award on behalf of beautiful Matilda, her brothers 3-year-old daughter with actress Michelle Williams. Even before The Dark Knight was released last summer, fellow actors, movie critics and others were predicting, and endorsing, an Oscar nomination for his chilling portrayal.

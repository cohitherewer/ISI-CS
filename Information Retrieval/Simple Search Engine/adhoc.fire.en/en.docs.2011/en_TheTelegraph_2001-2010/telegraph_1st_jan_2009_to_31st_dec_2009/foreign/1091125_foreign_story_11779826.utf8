                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      Fall was planned, says JLo
                              Really fun                            
	Los Angeles, Nov. 24 (PTI): Singer and actress Jennifer Lopez has laughed off the embarrassing fall she had while performing at the American Music Awards, saying that it was a planned move.         
	At Ryan Seacrests radio show, where Lopez was the butt of many jokes, the singer said that the accident was a choreographed move, reports People magazine.        
	Did I trip a little bit? I dont even remember, Lopez, 40, joked adding: Yeah, I meant to do that. That was part of the choreography.         
	But the singer contradicted herself by saying that she recovered quickly.         
	The measure of things isnt what happens when you fall, its how you recover when you fall. It was fun, it was really fun.It was nice to be back on stage and doing my thing, she said.

                                                                                                               Strong quake adds to disease woes
                            
	Mexico City, April 27 (Reuters): Southern Mexico was hit by a 6.0 magnitude earthquake today that shook buildings in the capital, Mexico City, but there were no immediate reports of deaths or damage.        
	Hundreds of people evacuated buildings in the capital, many of them wearing surgical face masks due to the deadly swine flu outbreak that is suspected of causing 149 deaths in Mexico.        
	The US Geological Survey said the quakes epicentre was 30km south-southeast of Tixtla, Guerrero, about 240km from Mexico City. Its epicentre was 40km deep.        
	It felt really strong here. Theres been no one hurt or killed ... were monitoring the situation in the area, said Marcos Gonzalez, a civil protection official in the city of Chilpancingo, near the epicentre.        
	There were no immediate reports of deaths or damage from the quake in Mexico City, whose sprawling metropolitan area has a population of around 20 million, a civil protection official said. Quakes of magnitude 6.0 are classified as strong and are capable of causing severe damage.        
	The Mexican peso, already battered by jitters over the swine flu outbreak, fell back to its earlier lows following the earthquake.        
	Im scared, said Sarai Luna Pajas, a 22-year-old social services worker standing outside her office building moments after the earthquake. We Mexicans are not used to living with so much fear, but all that is happening  the economic crisis, the illnesses and now this  it feels like the Apocalypse.        
	Co-worker Harold Gutierrez, 21, said the country was taking comfort from its religious faith.

	Royal Potter    
	 London, June 28 (PTI): Queen Elizabeth will let the filmmakers of Harry Potter shoot their next movie in her woods.       
	The British queen has rented out part of a huge forest near Windsor Castle to producers Warner Brothers, Sun has reported online.      
	The star cast of the film, including actor Daniel Radcliffe, will film the final part of J.K. Rowlings wizard novel Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows in a section of the 2,600-acre Swinley Forest in Berkshire which has been sealed off for the shooting.      
	The queen, herself a big Potter fan, is said to be delighted to rent out her woods for the movie. Crown Estate staff have reportedly struck a lucrative deal with the producers but the amount has not been disclosed.

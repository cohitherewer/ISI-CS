The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Scan on jet speed sensor

	Sao Paulo, June 7: Investigators said Air France, the airline company one of whose planes crashed into the Atlantic on Monday, had not yet replaced a key part for monitoring air speed on the plane as recommended by its manufacturer.         
	Investigators have been looking into whether inconsistent speed measurements could have played a role in the crash of the Airbus 330. The speed-sensing system includes what is known as a Pitot tube, the part Airbus recommended replacing on some of its planes. The tubes are vulnerable to icing in high-altitude storms, the type of weather the plane may have encountered four hours into the flight to Paris from Rio de Janeiro.         
	Still, Paul-Louis Arslanian, director of BEA, the French agency investigating the disaster, said yesterday it was far too early to conclude that a malfunction of the sensors was to blame for the accident, saying that the crew might still have been able to fly the aircraft if it had degraded systems.         
	An Airbus spokesperson said the company issued its advisory two years ago because a better part was available, not because the existing one was a safety issue.        
	Air France, however, said it was accelerating the replacement of speed sensors on all its long-haul planes. It said it had begun the switchover five weeks before the crash.

                                                                                                               Goody rushed to hospital
                            
	London, March 2 (Reuters): Terminally ill reality television star Jade Goody has been transferred to hospital as her condition has worsensed.        
	Goody, who married her ex-convict lover Jack Tweed in a blaze of publicity last month, was taken to the Royal Marsden hospital in London after complaining of acute stomach pains, newspapers reported today.        
	She phoned me in floods of tears saying: I just cant stand this any more, her publicist Max Clifford told the Daily Mirror. I asked her where the pain was and she said in her tummy, which is where it was before they operated to remove a blockage in her bowel.

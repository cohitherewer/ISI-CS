The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | FIR slap on Musharraf
                                                                                                               FIR slap on Musharraf
          NASIR JAFFRY AND AGENCIES                          Musharraf                                  
	Islamabad, Aug. 11: Pakistani police today registered a criminal case against Pervez Musharraf for putting judges under house arrest after imposing Emergency in 2007, a step that might force him to turn his current stay abroad into a permanent exile.         
	If convicted, Musharraf, who has been living in the UK for the past few months, faces a jail term of three years.         
	An Islamabad court ordered the registration of an FIR against the former President almost two weeks after the supreme court declared that the imposition of the Emergency and the purging of the judiciary was illegal and unconstitutional.        
	This is the first time that such a case has been brought against a former military ruler.        
	He could either be arrested on his return or through the Interpol, Hakam Khan, the head of a police station in Islamabad where the case was lodged, told Reuters.        
	Musharraf, who became President for the second time in October 2007 while holding the office of the army chief, imposed the Emergency and deposed 60 judges, including Chief Justice Iftikhar Mohammad Chaudhry, in an apparent bid to prevent the apex court from overturning his controversial election victory. Under Pakistani law, Musharraf was ineligible to contest the election in uniform.         
	The lower courts order came on a petition filed by lawyer Aslam Ghuman.         
	Former President Pervez Musharraf and others had detained judges of the supreme court of Pakistan and their families, and their children were neither allowed to attend school nor were they permitted to appear in examinations, the petitioner said.         
	Judge Mohammad Akmal Khan directed Islamabad police to register a case against Musharraf. A cognizable offence had been committed in palpable terms, the judge said, allowing the petition.

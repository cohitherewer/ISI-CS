	Islamabad, Aug. 26 (PTI): Ten people were killed in violent incidents today as life in most parts of Balochistan province was paralysed by a strike called to mark the third death anniversary of nationalist leader Nawab Akbar Bugti.        
	The shutdown was called by Bugtis Jamhoori Watan Party and the Baloch National Front. Shops were closed and roads were empty. Special prayers were organised for Bugti, former governor and chief minister of Balochistan, who was killed in a military operation on August 26, 2006.        
	Unknown gunmen attacked a security checkpoint and tried to blow up a gas pipeline near Jafarabad last night, Geo news said. In a gun battle, security forces killed seven of the attackers.        
	TV channels said three security personnel and two policemen were wounded in the attack. Commercial activities came to a halt in provincial capital Quetta and other major towns and cities.

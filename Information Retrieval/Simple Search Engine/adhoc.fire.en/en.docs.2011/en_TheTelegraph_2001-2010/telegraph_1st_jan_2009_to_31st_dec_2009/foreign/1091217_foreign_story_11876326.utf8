The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Zardari safe, presidency under threat
                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      Zardari safe, presidency under threat
                                  
	Islamabad, Dec. 16 (Reuters): The Pakistan Supreme Court ruled today against an amnesty decree that protected President Asif Ali Zardari and some aides from graft charges.        
	Here are some questions and answers on the political implications of the ruling in Pakistan and the region.        
	 WHAT DOES THIS MEAN FOR ZARDARI?        
	Zardari is safe from prosecution because of presidential immunity. But legal experts say his legitimacy for the presidency could be challenged by those who see his 2008 election as President as invalid. These issues are bound to take a great deal of time to resolve and give him room to try to make political alliances. No matter what the outcome, the rejection of the amnesty decree issued by former president Pervez Musharraf in 2007 will further weaken Zardari, whose image has long been tarnished by allegedly shady deals in the 1990s. He also faced murder charges.         
	 WHAT IS THE BIG PICTURE?        
	The court ruling has far wider implications than threatening Zardaris bumpy political career. Political turmoil in Pakistan makes Washington nervous. President Barack Obama is banking on Pakistan to help him stablise Afghanistan.        
	There is less chance of that happening if Pakistan is unstable. Zardaris interior and defence ministers are among those on a list of 8,000 politicians and bureaucrats that would have been protected under the amnesty. Now they may be casualties if they end up in court.        
	Zardaris downfall would not mean his party loses power  it could put up a new candidate for President. His main rival, former Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif, hopes to win the next parliamentary election, due by 2013, although turmoil might present him with a chance to force early polls.         
	Widely respected army chief General Ashfaq Kayani has won the respect of Washington. He could be a useful ally, as long as the Americans dont try to push their weight around too much with an army that doesnt take kindly to outside pressure.        
	Kayani is seen as a professional soldier who has vowed to keep the army out of politics in a country ruled by the military for more than half of its 62-year history.         
	 HOW WILL THE TALIBAN REACT?        
	The militants can be expected to capitalise on political uncertainty and step up bomb attacks. The Taliban are becoming more ambitious, with brazen operations like a recent suicide attack at a mosque near Pakistans military headquarters, challenging the belief that the army is invincible.         
	Political turmoil would fit in with their plans to spread chaos.

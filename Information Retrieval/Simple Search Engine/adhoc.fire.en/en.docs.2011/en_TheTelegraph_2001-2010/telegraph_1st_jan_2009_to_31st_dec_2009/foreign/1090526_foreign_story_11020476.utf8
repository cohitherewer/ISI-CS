	Tehran, May 25: Iran blocked access to Facebook on Saturday in what Opposition candidates said was an effort to sabotage their challenges to President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad.         
	Facebook has become hugely popular in Iran, where young urbanites use it to connect with friends, play online games and share photographs. Recently, lively discussions had taken place on the social-networking website among Iranians who wondered whether voting in the June 12 presidential election meant supporting Irans system of clerical rule, or, as some argued, could be used to remove Ahmadinejad.         
	Ahmadinejads three opponents also used the site to spread campaign messages that, until recently, had been ignored by Irans government-controlled national broadcaster.         
	Yesterday afternoon, when Iranian Shia cleric Mohammad Ali Abtahi wanted to check the latest election discussions on Facebook, he found that it had been blocked.         
	The government wants to prevent all free discussions on the elections, said Abtahi, a former vice-president who is adviser to Mehdi Karroubi, one of the challengers, who advocates more civil rights.         
	I had more than 3,000 friends, Abtahi said in a telephone interview. Those people used the site to discuss freely, something which unfortunately is not possible in our national media.        
	We used Facebook to be in direct contact with the voters, said Saleh Behesti, 22, an industrial design student who helped organise the Internet campaign of Mir Hossein Mousavi, who has mounted the most serious challenge to Ahmadinejad. We had 6,000 people on Facebook sending information on Mousavis speeches and meetings.

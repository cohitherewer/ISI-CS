          RICHARD EDWARDS                          Cambridge University: Picture imperfect                                  
	London, Oct. 29: Cambridge University is at the centre of a row over its first tabloid, which includes students posing as Page 3 girls under the banner Totty.        
	An online redtop called The Tab was launched this year and received 80,000 hits in its first week.        
	But a section where students pose in their underwear has caused controversy and led to calls for the scantily clad students to be covered up.        
	The Cambridge student union womens officer, Natalie Szarek, said that they should be removed because they reproduce and reinforce harmful attitudes towards women.        
	Szarek complained that semi-naked women in provocative positions are being shoved in freshers faces, adding: We can do better as a university.        
	Meanwhile, one of the student models, who posed on a punt in a small pink bikini and high heels, requested her photos removed from the site.        
	Becky Adams was said to have been embarrassed by the fall out of appearing in the tabloid and said she had only done it as a favour for a friend.        
	Until yesterday, a picture of her accompanied an article headlined Bra-vo  a piece about a study which found that Cambridge women have on average the ninth largest bra sizes in the UK.        
	She was replaced by a picture of a large blue bra, without a woman attached.Taymoor Atighetchi, 21, a third-year student at Trinity College and one of the tabloids three co-founders who paid 500 each to launch the website, defended The Tab and said it would continue its style of journalism.        
	Theres a huge amount of intellectual snobbery around, mainly from those who havent read the site, he said.        
	We do not think what we are doing is sexist. It was always the intention to have a debate about these issues. The website is a tongue-in-cheek version of the tabloid newspaper  we are not just emulating it. Editorials in the tabloid have hit back at Szarek, and highlighted her arrest at a recent protest.                     THE DAILY TELEGRAPH

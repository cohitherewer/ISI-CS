The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Heckler calls Obama liar
                                                                                                               Heckler calls Obama liar
          CARL HULSE                          Representative Wilson at Capitol Hill. (AFP)                                  
	Washington, Sept. 10: It was a rare breach of the protocol that governs ritualistic events in the Capitol.        
	In an angry and very audible outburst, Republican Representative Joe Wilson interrupted President Obamas speech last night with a shout of You lie!        
	His eruption  in response to Obamas statement that Democratic health proposals would not cover illegal immigrants  stunned members of both parties in the House chamber. Democrats said it showed lack of respect for the office of the presidency and was reminiscent of Republican disruptions at recent public forums on health care.        
	It is outrageous, said Representative Joseph Crowley, Democrat of New York, who said it reminded him of the antics that are being used to disrupt and fog what is going on.        
	After the speech, Rahm Emanuel, the White House chief of staff who sat a few rows in front of Wilson, said he immediately approached senior Republican lawmakers to encourage them to identify the heckler and urge him to issue an apology quickly. No President has ever been treated like that. Ever, Emanuel said.        
	Other Democrats said they did not want to dwell on the outburst or allow it to overshadow what they saw as an effective address by the President.         
	Today, Obama said during a cabinet meeting that he had accepted Wilsons apology. I am big believer that we all make mistakes, Obama said. He apologised quickly, and without equivocation and I am appreciative of that.

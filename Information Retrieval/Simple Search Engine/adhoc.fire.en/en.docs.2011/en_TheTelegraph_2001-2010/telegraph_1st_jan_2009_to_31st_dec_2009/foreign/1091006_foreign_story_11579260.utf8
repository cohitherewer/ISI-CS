	Islamabad, Oct. 5 (Reuters): The new chief of Pakistani Taliban militants, who US and Pakistani officials said might be dead, has surfaced to meet journalists in his stronghold of South Waziristan.        
	Hakimullah Mehsud, who became Pakistani Taliban chief after his predecessor, Baitullah Mehsud, was killed in a US missile strike in early August, looked healthy in pictures broadcast by Pakistans Dawn Television today. Sailab Mehsud, one of the journalists who met the militant chief on Sunday, said Hakimullah had vowed revenge for Baitullahs killing. US intelligence officials had said they believed that Hakimullah might have been killed in a shootout.

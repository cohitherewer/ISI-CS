	Keira cookery    
	 London, Dec. 25 (PTI): Actress Keira Knightley has asked Santa Claus for a cook book this Christmas, as her cookery exploits always end up in a disaster.      
	The Pirates of the Caribbean star has admitted that she is no culinary expert and can rarely rustle up a meal without spoiling anything, reports www.Contactmusic.com.      
	I am not the best cook in the world. I have tried, but I really am hopeless. I can cook maybe one dish. But even then, if you ate it, youd probably end up with food poisoning, she said.       
	 But Knightley is asking Santa Claus to gift her a cookbook this Christmas so she can improve her kitchen skills.

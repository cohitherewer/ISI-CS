The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Most women prefer male bosses
                                                                                                               Most women prefer male bosses
                              AUTHORITATIVE                            
	London, Aug. 13: Two-thirds of women prefer working for male bosses because they are better managers and less prone to moods, a study has suggested.        
	Many female employees also like having a man in charge because they are more authoritative and more straight-talking than their female counterparts.        
	Women rated men tougher, better at delegation and also more likely to regularly dish out praise.        
	And men were also hailed as being better decision-makers and having more grasp of the business overall than women do. It also emerged four out of ten women who have female bosses believe they could do a better job than their immediate superior.         
	The survey results were revealed in the wake of Labour deputy leader Harriet Harmans comment that men cannot be left to run things on their own. Yesterday, a spokesman for www.OnePoll.com, which carried out the research, said: The results make interesting reading as there were pros and cons to both sexes.        
	The research found while women are good at dealing with employees personal issues within the office environment most felt men were better at steering the ship.        
	Men were also revealed to be better at having an overall vision of the direction the business was going to take over the long-term. But women were better at dealing with those slightly uncomfortable issues that pop up from time to time because they were felt to be better listeners than men.        
	On the other hand many women felt they could do as good or even better than their female boss while only a handful said they could emulate their male manager.         
	The results do paint a picture of men being a bit harder and more driven, but that isnt always the kind of approach which is needed.        
	So perhaps Harriet Harman was right when she said there should be a management team made up of men and women to balance things up.        
	The study of 2,000 women in full or part-time employment asked whether they would prefer to have a man or woman as their immediate line manager. Some 63 per cent expressed a male preference, while only 37 per cent opted for a woman.        
	The results also revealed one in six women who currently work under a woman is experiencing underlying tension between themselves and their boss. A host of reasons emerged for the male preference including a feeling female managers felt threatened by other women at work.

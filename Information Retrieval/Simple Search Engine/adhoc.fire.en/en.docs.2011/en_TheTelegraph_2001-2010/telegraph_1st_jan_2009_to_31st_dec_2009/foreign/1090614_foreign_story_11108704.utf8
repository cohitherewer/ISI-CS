	Tehran, June 13 (Reuters): Thousands of people clashed with police today after the disputed election victory of President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad sparked the biggest protests in Tehran since the 1979 Islamic revolution.        
	Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei told Iranians to respect Ahmadinejads victory in an presidential election that his closest challenger described as a dangerous charade.        
	Ahmadinejads triumph in yesterdays vote upset expectations that reformist candidate Mir Hossein Mousavi might win the race.        
	Up to 3,000 Mousavi supporters took part in the protests. In one place, some chanted,What happened to our vote?. Others chanted anti-Ahmadinejad slogans, bringing traffic to a standstill. We are Iranians too, and Mousavi is our President, they shouted.        
	Interior minister Sadeq Mahsouli, an Ahmadinejad ally, declared the President had been re-elected to a second four-year term with 62.6 per cent of the vote, against 33.7 per cent for Mousavi, in a record 85 per cent turnout.        
	Mousavi protested against what he called violations and vote-rigging during the election. Interior ministry officials rejected the allegations.        
	Mousavi said members of his election headquarters had been beaten with batons, wooden sticks and electrical rods.        
	In one incident police on motorcycles beat Mousavi backers who were staging a sit-in protest at the capitals Vanak square. At Tehran University, some 100 police with helmets and shields used tear and pepper gas as they chased 300-400 students, who were chanting: People: support us, support us.        
	Shops in the area were closed and small fires were burning on the street. Police later cordoned off the university area and were attacking student demonstrators, witnesses said.         
	A witness also said he had heard shots fired near a busy street in northern Tehran but it was not clear who was shooting and why.        
	Khamenei, Irans top authority, told defeated candidates and their supporters to avoid provocative behaviour.        
	The chosen and respected President is the President of all the Iranian nation and everyone, including yesterdays competitors, must unanimously support and help him, Khamenei said in a statement read on state television.        
	Mousavi, a veteran of the 1979 Islamic revolution, protested against what he said were many obvious election violations. Im warning I will not surrender to this dangerous charade. The result of such performance by some officials will jeopardise the pillars of the Islamic Republic and will establish tyranny, Mousavi said in a statement made available to Reuters.        
	Mousavi urged senior clerics in Irans Sha religious centre of Qom to speak out.        
	Today all the ways to preserve our rights are closed. Silence of the ulema and grand ayatollahs may create more harm than fixing voting, he said in a statement on his website.        
	Iranian and western analysts said Ahmadinejads re-election would disappoint western powers aiming to convince Iran to halt a nuclear programme they suspect is aimed at making bombs, and could further complicate efforts by President Barack Obama to reach out to Tehran.        
	It doesnt augur well for an early and peaceful settlement of the nuclear dispute, said Mark Fitzpatrick at Londons International Institute for Strategic Studies.        
	US secretary of state Hillary Clinton said the US was monitoring the outcome of the election closely and hoped the results reflected the will of the Iranian people.        
	A bitter campaign generated intense excitement inside Iran and revealed deep divisions between those backing Ahmadinejad and those pushing for social and political change.        
	Ahmadinejad accused his rivals of undermining the Islamic Republic by advocating detente with the West. Mousavi said the Presidents extremist foreign policy had humiliated Iranians.        
	Last night, before official results emerged, Mousavi had claimed to be the definite winner. He said many people had been unable to vote and ballot papers were lacking. He also accused authorities of blocking text messaging, with which his campaign tried to reach young, urban voters.        
	Today, Irans students news agency ISNA quoted Tehrans deputy prosecutor General Mahmoud Salarkia as saying 10 people had been detained for agitating public opinion through websites and blogs by propagating untruthful reports.        
	Ahmadinejad draws most of his support from rural areas and poorer big city neighbourhoods. Mousavi enjoys strong backing in wealthier urban centres, especially among women and the young.        
	Two other candidates attracted only minimal support.

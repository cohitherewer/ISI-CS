          RICHARD ALLEYNE                          Cambridge University                                  
	London, Feb. 8: Downing a pint containing a live goldfish, eating raw squid and wearing kippers around necks are among the bizarre and sometimes dangerous initiation ceremonies at Cambridge University, it has been disclosed.         
	The tests  organised by sport and drinking clubs for first years  usually involve excessive amounts of alcohol and can include carrying out degrading and depraved acts often by female students.        
	According to the universitys student newspaper Varsity, which compiled the list, many of the rituals are carried out shirtless because they often involve vomiting.        
	But while many consider them to be part of the tradition of the university, others including the National Union of Students have called for them to be banned.        
	New members of The Wyverns, Magdalene Colleges mens drinking society, have to eat a 15 course meal with delicacies such as a pigs snout with wasabi sauce and a pint of water with a goldfish swimming inside.         
	If this is regurgitated with the said creature still alive, it exempts the diner from two of the following courses, Varsity has revealed.         
	This years initiation, which took place last week, featured raw leeks, whole, uncooked squids and entire chillies. Four prospective members then had kippers put round their necks and had to down four pints in three minutes, each containing food, spices and other foreign liquids.         
	Those joining the Ferretz, an inter-collegiate drinking society, have to consume 80 units beginning with a bottle of gin and finishing with a bottle of port, consumed through a condom.         
	Many female societies at the university prefer to set girls tasks such as collecting obscure items of clothing from strangers, kissing strangers and dressing up.         
	An 18-year-old first-year Exeter student died from alcohol poisoning in 2006 after drinking four vodkas, three pints of cider, a glass of wine and numerous sambucas before downing a pint of spirits as part of a golf club initiation.         
	Another died in 2003 after choking on his own vomit.                    THE SUNDAY TELEGRAPH

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Helmet debate
                                                                                                               Helmet debate
                            
	Canberra, March 19 (Reuters): The death of British actress Natasha Richardson from a severe brain injury following a skiing accident has reignited the debate over helmets on ski slopes. She was reportedly not wearing one.        
	Richardson, 45, a member of Britains Redgrave acting dynasty, fell during a private skiing lesson on a beginners slope at Canadas Mont Tremblant resort on Monday. She died in New York yesterday, surrounded by her family.        
	Her death came about 10 years after singer-turned-politician Sonny Bono and Michael L. Kennedy, son of assassinated Robert F. Kennedy, died after skiing into trees at high speed and not wearing a helmet.         
	Helmets, once rarely seen on skiers or snowboarders, have become increasingly popular but the jury remains divided on their effectiveness and whether their use should be compulsory. Some medical groups, including the Association of Quebec Emergency Room Doctors, have called for helmets to be mandatory, claiming 60 per cent of head traumas could be avoided. Some countries are introducing laws over helmet use for children. Jeff Hanle, a spokesman for the Aspen Skiing company that runs resorts in Colorado, said all children under 12 at Aspen ski schools had to wear helmets.

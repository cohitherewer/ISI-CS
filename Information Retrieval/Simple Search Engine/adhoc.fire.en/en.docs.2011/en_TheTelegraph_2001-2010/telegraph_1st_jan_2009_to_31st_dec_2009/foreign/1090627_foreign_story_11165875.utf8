	Two of India rsquo;s celebrated dancers, whose styles have often been  compared to that of Michael Jackson, speak to The Telegraph             
	Mithun Chakraborty   
	You can imagine how much I loved MichMithun Chakraborty ael Jackson mdash; I named my eldest son Mimoh after him (and Mohammad   Ali: lsquo;Mi rsquo; from Michael and lsquo;Moh rsquo; from   Mohammad).  Jackson was a genius; in fact genius   is an understatement for an icon of   his stature.  
	 I followed Jackson from the beginning, whatever little I could see of him on   TV in those days. I would pick up   steps watching him, emulating his   Moonwalk.  Then later when I became a star   people started comparing my dancing skills with his! Especially after 
  Disco Dancer (1983). I felt humbled.  I have no hesitation in accepting that   I used to try and emulate his style.   
	 Not that I blindly followed him, but yes   I learnt a lot from him and then did it my way. I loved his pelvic thrusts and tried them in many of my films.  
	 I always used to wonder how someone could be so electrifying, how a man could connect to the audience the world over   irrespective of colour, cast and creed. He ruled millions of hearts, young and old.   His stage shows were electrifying.   
	 His life was mired in controversies,   but nothing can stop Jackson,   nothing can tarnish him, no power   on earth can pull him down.  I am sad, not because Michael Jackson is no more, because for me he is immortal, but because he was only 50. Too young 
  for an icon to pass away. Since morning I have looked up and asked just one 
  question: why so soon?  
	 For me he will always live. Jackson is like   a Phoenix, he can only rise, never perish. He was one of his kind, a wonder star.  
	Prabhu Deva 
  Actor and choreographer            
	When a friend called me in the morning and informed me that Jackson had died, I could not believe it till I switched on CNN. Only now it is sinking in. I am yet to recover from the shock.  
	 I can rsquo;t imagine anyone could dance like that. I love all of Jackson rsquo;s albums but Thriller remains my favourite because it was after (watching the video) that I decided to make dancing a career.  
	 I played it (Thriller tape) so many times that it snapped and my father had to get me a fresh one. It is unfair to compare me with an icon like him. I am not equal to even his shadow. He is a such a   great legend and I am 
  only his pupil.  
	 My meeting with him at his hotel (in Mumbai in 1996) was an amazing experience that I will always cherish.   
	e was like a child and thrilled when someone described me as India rsquo;s Michael Jackson. He immediately asked to do a few moves and when I did he was so happy that he gave me a warm hug. I will always remember him as the finest modern day dancer and also a great human being.  
	 I hope I come up with something befitting (as a tribute at a dance competition he would be judging this evening).

	Comic sale    
	 London, March 14: A mystery buyer has paid $317,200 for a rare copy of the first Superman comic book, which had a cover price of only 10 cents when it was published in 1938, reports The Daily Telegraph.      
	Only around 100 copies of the publication are left. It is credited with being the first appearance of any cartoon superhero.       
	Bids in the online auction, which started two weeks ago on www.comicconnect.com, immediately topped $200,000 and a last-minute surge crossed the $300,000 mark.       
	There were 89 bids and the online auction house extended the deadline by several minutes to catch the late interest. Neither the seller nor the buyer were identified.     
	Ladies Tom    
	 Washington (AP): Tom Jones is not one to kiss and tell, but hes singing for the first time about his reputation as a ladies man. That, and how grateful he is that his wife stuck by him for 52 years. Jones sings on The Road that I have felt weakness when I was strong, felt sweetness when I was wrong.

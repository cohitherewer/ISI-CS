	Landi Kotal (Pakistan), March 27 (Reuters): A suicide bomber killed 50 people when he blew himself up in a crowded Pakistani mosque near the Afghan border today, government officials said.        
	The attack came hours before President Barack Obama announced a new strategy for the Afghan war.        
	Police, paramilitary forces and government officials were among the congregation in the mosque near Jamrud town, about 30km from the Afghan border, when the attack happened.        
	The bomber set off his explosives as an imam, began the service.        
	The moment the imam said Allah-u-Akbar (God is Greatest), the blast went off, said Tauseer Khan, 70, from a hospital bed in Peshawar.        
	It was huge. I still cant hear properly, said Khan, who had wounds to his hands and face. His son and grandson were also wounded.        
	Rahat Gul, a spokesman for the Khyber administration had earlier said 50 people had been killed and 75 wounded but Tariq Hayat Khan, Khybers top government administrator later revised the death toll to 37.        
	Among the dead were 14 policemen and paramilitary soldiers while 100 were wounded, Khan said. Between 250 and 300 people were in the mosque at the time of the blast, he said.        
	The attacker was seen jumping into the courtyard of the mosque and blowing himself up, Khan said. The two-storey building collapsed.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Antoinette slur on Carla Bruni

	Paris, Oct. 30: Carla Bruni has been condemned as the new Marie Antoinette of France by the countrys leading society magazine.        
	Point de Vue presents the 41-year-old wife of President Nicolas Sarkozy as a daffy multi-millionaire socialite who does very little real work and is completely out of touch with ordinary people.        
	The attack by the Paris weekly, which specialises in covering the lives of aristocrats and European royalty, will come as a huge blow to Sarkozy as he fights to deflect accusations of a monarchical style. The French President last week was forced into a humiliating public climb-down after the candidacy of his 23-year-old son, referred to in the French media as Prince Jean, for a plum job as head of Pariss largest business district.        
	The magazine juxtaposes photos of the Presidents third wife with paintings of Marie Antoinette, the Queen of France whose high living and laziness led to her being guillotined in 1793, at the height of the French Revolution.        
	Same posture, same look, same smile, writes Point de Vue at the start of an eight page feature, adding that both women were infamous for their obsession with designer clothes and their own physical images.        
	While Marie Antoinette relied on court artist Elisabeth Vigee-Le Brun for her flattering portraits, Bruni gets hers done by American photographer Annie Lebovitz, who charges thousands of dollars a picture.        
	Both share a love of music and performing: while the French Queen would sing and play the harpsichord, Bruni is a self-styled pop singer. The magazine claims that Brunis faddish tastes were out of step with traditional rural French, who expected their First Ladies to be both self-effacing and hard working.

	Kuala Lumpur, Aug. 1 (Reuters): Malaysian police used tear gas and water cannon to disperse thousands of protesters today, arresting almost 600 people in the biggest demonstration in the countrys capital in almost two years.        
	Up to 10,000 protesters, headed by Opposition leader Anwar Ibrahim, gathered in the Malaysian capital to demand that the government rescind a law that allows imprisonment without trial, a measure that has in the past been used against the Opposition.        
	We gather today to fight a cruel law under a cruel administration, Anwar told the rally. Police fired tear gas from the tops of buildings in the centre of Kuala Lumpur in an effort to prevent demonstrations from building up. They also mounted roadblocks in the Malaysian capital, causing huge traffic jams.        
	The mainly Malay crowd gathered at the national mosque, chantingAllah-u- Akbar (God is greatest) and Down with the government, sending passersby fleeing.

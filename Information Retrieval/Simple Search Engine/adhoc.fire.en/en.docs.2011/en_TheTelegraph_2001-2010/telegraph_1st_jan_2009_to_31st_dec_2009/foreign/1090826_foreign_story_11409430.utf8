The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Mehsud dead: Taliban
                                                                                                               Mehsud dead: Taliban
                              Baitullah Mehsud                            
	Islamabad, Aug. 25 (Reuters): Pakistani Taliban militants have for the first time confirmed that their leader, Baitullah Mehsud, has been killed, the BBC reported today.        
	Pakistani and US officials have been saying for days that Mehsud was killed in a US missile strike in his South Waziristan stronghold near the Afghan border on August 5, but the Taliban have been denying it.        
	The BBC said on its website (www.news.bbc.co.uk) that two Taliban commanders loyal to Mehsud, Hakimullah Mehsud and Wali-ur-Rehman had confirmed that Baitullah Mehsud had been killed.        
	Pakistan and US officials have been saying the militants appeared to be in disarray since Mehsuds death, with reports of infighting between factions vying to take command.        
	Analysts saw the Talibans earlier denials that Mehsud was dead as an attempt to hide divisions over who should take charge of the Tehrik-e-Taliban Pakistan, or Taliban Movement of Pakistan, an alliance of militant factions.        
	Another Taliban commander announced on Saturday that Hakimullah Mehsud had been chosen as the new leader of the Pakistani Taliban as Baitullah Mehsud was sick. The Pakistani Taliban are allies of al Qaida and the Afghan Taliban but have mostly been fighting against Pakistani security forces.        
	Swat bodies        
	Villagers in the Swat Valley have found the bodies of 14 suspected militants, reviving concern about extra-judicial killings after a successful army offensive against Taliban militants.

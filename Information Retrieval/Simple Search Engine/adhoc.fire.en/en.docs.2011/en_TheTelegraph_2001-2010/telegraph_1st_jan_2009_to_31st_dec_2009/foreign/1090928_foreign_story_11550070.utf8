The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Merkel wins polls
                                                                                                               Merkel wins polls
                                  
	Berlin, Sept. 27 (AP): German voters today handed conservative Chancellor Angela Merkel a second term and a chance to create a new Centre-Right government, while her Centre-Left rivals suffered a historic defeat in the national election.        
	Merkel succeeded in ending her grand coalition with the Social Democrats led by challenger Frank-Walter Steinmeier, the current foreign minister, according to television projections. She can now form a government with the pro-business Free Democrats, who performed very strongly.        
	We have achieved something great, a beaming Merkel told supporters. We have managed to achieve our election aim of a stable majority in Germany for a new government.        
	She vowed to hold swift and decisive coalition talks with the Free Democrats.

	Singapore, Nov. 15: President Barack Obama and other world leaders have decided to put off the difficult task of reaching a climate change agreement at a global climate conference scheduled for next month.        
	They have agreed instead to make it the mission of the Copenhagen conference to reach a less specific politically binding agreement that will punt the most difficult issues into the future.        
	At a hastily arranged breakfast on the sidelines of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit meeting today, the leaders, including Lars Lokke Rasmussen, the Prime Minister of Denmark and the chairman of the climate conference, agreed that in order to salvage Copenhagen they would have to push a fully binding legal agreement down the road, possibly to a second summit meeting in Mexico City later on.        
	There was an assessment by the leaders that it is unrealistic to expect that a full internationally, legally binding agreement could be negotiated between now and Copenhagen, which starts in 22 days, said Michael Froman, the deputy national security adviser for international economic affairs.         
	With the clock running out and deep differences unresolved, it has, for several months, appeared increasingly unlikely that the climate change negotiations in Denmark will produce a comprehensive and binding new treaty on global warming.         
	Todays agreement codifies what negotiators had accepted as all but inevitable: that representatives of the 192 nations in the talks would not resolve the outstanding issues in time. The gulf between rich and poor countries, and even among the wealthiest nations, was just too wide.        
	Among the chief barriers to a comprehensive deal in Copenhagen was Congresss inability to enact climate legislation that sets binding targets on greenhouse gases in the US. Without such a commitment, other nations are loath to make their own pledges.

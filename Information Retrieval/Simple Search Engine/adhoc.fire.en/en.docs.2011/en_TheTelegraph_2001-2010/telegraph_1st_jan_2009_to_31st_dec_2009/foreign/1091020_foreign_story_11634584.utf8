The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Karzai votes invalidated, run-off likely
                                                                                                               Karzai votes invalidated, run-off likely
                                  
	Kabul, Oct. 19 (Reuters): International observers called for an election run-off in Afghanistan after a UN-backed fraud watchdog today invalidated tens of thousands of votes for President Hamid Karzai from Augusts disputed first round.        
	The August 20 vote, marred by allegations of widespread fraud, has fanned tension between President Hamid Karzai and western governments whose troops are fighting a resurgent Taliban in Afghanistan. The protracted voting process has complicated President Barack Obamas deliberations on whether to send thousands of additional troops to turn the tide in the eight-year war.        
	US group Democracy International said the report by the Electoral Complaints Commission showed that the number of votes invalidated by the UN-backed watchdog pushed Karzais total below the 50 per cent level needed to avoid a run-off against his main challenger, former foreign minister Abdullah Abdullah.        
	Democracy International and the Washington-based US Institute of Peace both said the ECCs audit showed Karzai now had about 48.3 per cent, with Abdullahs total rising to about 31 per cent from 28 per cent. Democracy International ... believes the ECC audit decisions should result in a run-off election, according to Afghanistans electoral law, it said in a statement sent to Reuters. Provisional results had originally given Karzai 54.6 per cent.        
	J. Alexander Thier, Afghanistan and Pakistan director for the US Institute of Peace, said the ECC had thrown out votes from 210 polling stations of about 350 sampled, according to ECC data.        
	Diplomats in Kabul also said the findings, presented by the ECC as a dense report packed with dozens of pages of technical detail, effectively paved the way for a second round run-off.        
	Everything we are hearing is pointing at the second round. That is what we are bracing for, said one western diplomat.

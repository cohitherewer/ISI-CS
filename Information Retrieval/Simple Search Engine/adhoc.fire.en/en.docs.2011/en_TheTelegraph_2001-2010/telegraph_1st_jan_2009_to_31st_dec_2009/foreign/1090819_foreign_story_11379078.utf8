                                                                                                               Tunisian pregnant with dozen babies
                            
	London, Aug. 18: A Tunisian woman is reported to be about to eclipse the octuplets of the American mother Nadia Suleman after becoming pregnant with 12 babies.        
	The unnamed teacher and her husband are said to be ecstatic about the pregnancy, which was achieved with fertility treatment after they suffered two miscarriages. They are expecting six boys and six girls and the woman is thought to be as much as nine months pregnant.        
	But fertility experts have condemned the news, alleging the doctors who treated the couple are irresponsible and risking the health and lives of the mother and her babies.                            THE DAILY TELEGRAPH

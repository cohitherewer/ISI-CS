	London, Feb. 1: A simple typing error brought Googles search engine to a grinding halt, preventing millions of people from finding web pages on the Internet.         
	The search engine incorrectly labelled all other websites as potentially harmful and stopped Internet users from directly clicking through to their search results.         
	The problem arose yesterday afternoon and was only fixed after 40 minutes  by which time millions of users had been affected.         
	The company later announced that the fault had been caused by human error when an internal list of harmful sites was updated. A single forward slash (/) was put on the list in place of a full web address, blacklisting every website because all web addresses contain the character.         
	The ensuing chaos prompted panic among web surfers who feared the popular search engine had suffered some kind of major failure that could have had serious implications for Internet commerce.         
	During the incident, search results erroneously identified all other websites  and some of Googles own pages  as containing malicious software or malware, and created a warning: This site may harm your computer.         
	Users trying to access search results during the outage were forced to cut and paste the links into the toolbar and visit the sites manually. Surfers who tried to find out about the error were unable to access Googles own blog as it had also been incorrectly identified as a harmful link.         
	Marissa Mayer, vice-president, Search Products amp; User Experience, later updated the companys blog to apologise for the blunder. She posted: This was clearly an error, and we are very sorry for the inconvenience caused to our users. What happened? Very simply, human error.         
	She said the problem was identified speedily and thanked her own staff for their quick work in fixing it. Our apologies to any of you who were inconvenienced, and to site owners whose pages were incorrectly labelled, she added.

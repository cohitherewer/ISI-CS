	Cruz love humour    
	 London, Dec. 19 (PTI): Actress Penelope Cruz finds shooting love scenes in films strange.       
	So, she makes her co-stars laugh to help relieve the tension.       
	Cruz appears as actor Daniel Day-Lewiss mistress in the musical Nine and filmed a series of intimate scenes with him, reports www.Contactmusic.com.       
	But Cruz did not quite enjoy the experience and turned to humour to get through the testing shots. Its always a very strange thing. I mean, we had the best director and I was in the best company, but its always strange... We laughed a lot together, because you have to bring humour to those situations, Cruz said.

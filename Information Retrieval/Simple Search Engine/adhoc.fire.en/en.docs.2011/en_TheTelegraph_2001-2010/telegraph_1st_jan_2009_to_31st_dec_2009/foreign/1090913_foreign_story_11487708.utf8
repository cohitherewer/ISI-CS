	London, Sept. 12: At least 10 people were arrested after police were attacked with bricks and bottles as demonstrations outside the Harrow Central Mosque in north London turned violent.        
	 Officers were caught in a stand-off between hundreds of anti-Islam and Muslim protesters outside the mosque, in Station Road, Harrow, late yesterday. Heavily armed police struggled to contain the escalating violence and at least 10 people were arrested as more than a 1,000 people descended on the area.        
	 Scotland Yard condemned the violent protesters, many of whom had covered their faces with ski masks, motorcycle helmets and scarves.         
	The violence came after the Stop Islamification of Europe (SIOE) group pledged to hold a peaceful protest outside the mosque, which coincided with the anniversary of the 9/11 attacks.        
	Counter protests were also planned at the site, where a new five-floor mosque is under construction.        
	After a day of peaceful protests, tensions reached boiling point when a gang of at least 100 pro-Islamic demonstrators broke away from the main body to chase away a small number of the anti-Mosque marchers.        
	Police wearing riot gear responded by closing roads and kettling in the protesters outside the mosque, refusing to allow movement between their lines.        
	Angry groups continued shouting and throwing sticks, bricks and bottles at the police lines. Police said nine arrests were made for possession of offensive weapons.        
	Items recovered included bottles of bleach, a hammer and a chisel but police said the arrests were not believed to be linked to the SIOE demonstration. Another was made to prevent a breach of the peace, but police said he was released after the threat had passed.        
	Scotland Yard superintendent Julia Pendry, who lead the operation, condemned the events that had played out on the streets of Harrow. She said they were completely unacceptable to everyone.        
	Unfortunately what unfolded was a series of acts of disorder and even cases of violence, she said.        
	Officers came under attack from bricks and bottles and we had to deploy our staff in protective equipment a number of times.        
	It is completely unacceptable for people to use the excuse of protest to break the law and behave in this way. She added: Weve been told that the majority of people that gathered in Station Road were not even part of the local community.

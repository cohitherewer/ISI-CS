	Cool Claudia     
	 London, Dec. 21 (PTI): Passengers travelling with supermodel Claudia Schiffer by a Eurostar train were left fuming after the authorities whisked her away in a private car after the train broke down.      
	The passengers, who were travelling from Paris to London by Eurostar on Saturday, faced a holiday nightmare when their train suffered an electrical fault in sever cold weather, leaving over 2,000 people stranded in the undersea Channel Tunnel.      
	Those stuck in a train car with Schiffer were infuriated after the blonde model was given special treatment. She was allowed to get off at Folkestone where a car was waiting to take her to her London home, reports the Daily Express.      
	French traveller Gregoire Sentilhes said: People are angry, frustrated and worried. People are having panic attacks because of the lack of air. Claudia Schiffer was also on the train but a car came right by the train to pick her up from the entrance to the tunnel. Nothing for the other 2,000 people though.

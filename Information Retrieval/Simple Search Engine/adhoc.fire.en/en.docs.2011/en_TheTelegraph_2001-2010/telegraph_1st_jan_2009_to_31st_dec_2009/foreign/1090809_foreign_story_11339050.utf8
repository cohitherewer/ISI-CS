The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Cuba shortage of toilet paper
                                                                                                               Cuba shortage of toilet paper
                            
	Havana, Aug. 8 (Reuters): Cuba, in the grip of a serious economic crisis, is running short of toilet paper and may not get sufficient supplies until the end of the year, officials with state-run companies said yesterday.        
	Officials said they were lowering the prices of 24 basic goods to help Cubans get through the difficulties provoked in part by the global financial crisis and three destructive hurricanes that struck the island last year.        
	Cubas financial reserves have been depleted by increased spending for imports and reduced export income, which has forced the communist-led government to take extraordinary measures to keep the economy afloat.        
	The corporation has taken all the steps so that at the end of the year there will be an important importation of toilet paper, an official with state conglomerate Cimex said.        
	The shipment will enable the state-run company to supply this demand that today is presenting problems, he said.        
	Cuba both imports toilet paper and produces its own, but does not currently have enough raw materials to make it, he said.         
	One of the measures taken to address the cash crunch is a 20 per cent cut in imports, which in recent days has become evident in the reduction of goods in state-run stores.        
	Cuba imports about 60 per cent of its food. A visit to a store in Havanas Vedado neighbourhood yesterday found that prices had dropped for mayonnaise, barbecue sauce and canned squid.One customer complained that it doesnt look like prices have been lowered.

                                                                                                               Cambridge honour for Amartya
          AMIT ROY                              
	London, Feb. 12: To the avalanche of honorary degrees Amartya Sen has gathered during his academic career is to be added another but this one is very special  its from his own university, Cambridge, and that, too, as it celebrates its 800th anniversary.        
	 After Presidency College in Calcutta, Sen was an undergraduate at Trinity, graduating in 1956 with the top First in Economics  he likes to tell the self-deprecating story of how he squeezed in only because another boy dropped out after being offered a place. He became a Fellow before completing his PhD in 1959.        
	 He returned to Trinity in 1998  he won his Nobel Prize for Economics that same year  to become its Master for six years, thereby becoming the first Asian to be elected head of an Oxbridge College.        
	 Sen, who is currently Lamont University Professor and Professor of Economics and Philosophy at Harvard University, will have Doctor of Letters conferred on him. At 75, he appears to spend much of his life in an aeroplane, giving learned lectures here, there and everywhere  or taking in daughter Nandanas movies  for he is probably the most sought after academic in the world.        
	 But he will be make it to the ancient degree ceremony in Cambridge on June 12 when the university will look its most glorious, as it always does in early summer.        
	 It is only very rarely that there are His/Hers honorary degrees but this is about to happen, probably for the first time, since Bill Gates, philanthropist and chairman of the Microsoft Corporation, will receive Doctor of Law, as will his wife, Melinda, for her philanthropy.        
	 There will be none of the Bill stuff at Cambridge  during the proceedings in Latin, the American will be addressed by his formal name, which is William Henry Gates III.        
	These nominations have to be formally agreed by the Regent House, the Universitys democratic governing community of scholars, as is always the way, said a Cambridge source.        
	 Among the others who are to be honoured, from the worlds of religion, business, science, music, history, and politics and economics, are: Prince Karim Al-Hussayni, the Aga Khan;        
	Baroness (Shirley) Williams of Crosby, Honorary Fellow of Newnham College;        
	Elizabeth Blackburn, Professor of Biology and Physiology at the University of California, San Francisco;        
	Professor Wallace Broecker, Climatologist, Columbia University;         
	Sir Peter Crane, the John amp; Marion Sullivan Professor in the Department of Geophysical Sciences at the University of Chicago, and former director of Kew Gardens;        
	Professor Wang Gungwu, director of the East Asian Institute, Singapore, and historian of China and the Chinese; and         
	Sir Peter Maxwell Davies, composer and conductor.         
	The last high profile Indian to be honoured, in 2006, was the prime minister, Manmohan Singh, who had also done his degree in Economics as an undergraduate at St Johns.        
	 Meanwhile, at Christs, after all the recent excitement to mark the 150th birth anniversary of Jagadish Chandra Bose, another old boy was honoured today  Prince Philip unveiled a statue of the young Charles Darwin, author of the Origin of Species whose 200th birth anniversary is being celebrated this year.        
	Asked how many honorary degrees he had collected, Sen told The Telegraph: Its in the nineties.        
	 He laughed and joked: I know I should not get so many. Perhaps when I get to 100, I will have to commit suicide!        
	 More seriously, he added: I am delighted with the honour from Cambridge  its my old university.        
	 He had known the Prime Minister, of course. I was in my third year when Manmohan came up. I went to see him at St Johns. He was already impressive.        
	 Sen disclosed he is finishing the manuscript to his latest book. Its on philosophy, its called The Idea of Justice. Its not about India but has lots of Indian examples.        
	 As modest as ever, Sen said he was grateful to be included for the honour alongside Wang Gungwu. Hes a great scholar. I am going to Singapore and, after that, he and the foreign minister of Singapore and a professor of Sanskrit from Beijing are coming with me to Gaya and then we go on to Nalanda on February 19.

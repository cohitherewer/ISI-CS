	Sargodha (Pakistan), Dec. 10: Five young Muslim American men from the Washington suburbs, who disappeared late last month, were detained in Pakistan yesterday in a police raid on a house linked to militant group Jaish-e-Mohammed, American and Pakistani officials said.        
	The were on their way to the heart of the Taliban sanctuary in Pakistans tribal areas with the intention of training to fight against American troops in Afghanistan, Pakistani police said today.        
	The men, a tight circle of friends in their late teens and their 20s, had been in contact through YouTube with a Pakistani militant with links to al Qaida before arriving in Pakistan on November 30, said the Pakistani officials, who had firsthand knowledge of the case.        
	After touching down in Karachi, the men tried to join an extremist Islamic school near Karachi and approached another extremist organisation, Jamaat-ud-Dawa, in Lahore, the officials said.        
	They were rebuffed in both places because of their western demeanour and the fact that they did not speak the national language, Urdu, an investigator said. They then came here, to Sargodha, a city in the north of Punjab, en route to North Waziristan, said the police chief of Sargodha, Usman Anwar.        
	Sargodha, one of Pakistans biggest cities and home to the central command of Pakistans air force, is also known as a centre for anti-India militant groups.         
	The arrests were made at a four-room home in a government housing complex belonging to an uncle of the eldest of the group, Umer Farooq, 25, according to Anwar. We had tips from local people and work of field officers that some foreigners were residing in some area of the city, Anwar said. We watched them for a day or so and then arrested them.        
	Farooqs parents were staying at the house at the time, and his father, Khalid, was arrested as well. The police chief said the elder Farooq knew his son and the other men were being hunted by the FBI but had failed to inform the authorities.        
	His mother, Sabria Farooq, was interviewed today at the house. She said she and her husband had emigrated to the US 20 years ago from Sargodha and had returned in September to start a computer business, similar to the one they have in the Virginia suburbs close to Washington.        
	Sabria Farooq, who was veiled and wearing a salwar kameez, said the family had informed the FBI of their concern that their son had fled to Pakistan, but she did not make it clear whether they knew Umer had arrived in Sargodha.         
	The arrests renewed concerns that American Muslim men with ethnic ties to Pakistan and other Muslim countries were increasingly at the centre of terrorist plots aimed against the US.

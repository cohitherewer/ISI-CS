	Vatican City, Dec 19 (Reuters): The late Pope John Paul II moved closer to sainthood in the Catholic church when his successor, Pope Benedict, approved a decree recognising that John Paul had lived the Christian faith heroically.        
	The Vatican said Benedict had approved the heroic virtues decree, one of the key steps in the procedure by which the church recognises its saints, after a recommendation by a Vatican panel of experts. The following step will be the recognition of a miracle attributed to John Paul, who died in 2005.

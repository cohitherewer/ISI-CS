	New Delhi, March 1: India has kept its special forces ready to counter possible fallout in case a coup is attempted in Bangladesh, sources told The Telegraph.         
	The 50 Parachute Independent Brigade, also engaged in the Liberation War of 1971, was two days ago moved from Agra to Kalaikunda in Bengal, government sources said.        
	The parachute regiment has fought on the eastern and western fronts. It had launched the famous Tangail Airdrop operation on December 11, 1971, to capture the Poongli bridge on the Jamuna that would cut off the 93 Brigade of the Pakistani army.        
	Other sources said such regiments were expected to be kept ready when neighbourhoods were in turmoil and it should not be construed as an alarmist posture.        
	The threat to the Awami League government became more pronounced after more than 700 armed BDR men escaped yesterday with heavy guns and rocket launchers. Some of them were arrested and interrogation revealed that the Jamaat-e-Islami was courting these rebels.        
	They have not joined the Jamaat yet, but if they do, it is a big worry, a source said.        
	The source said investigating agencies suspected the hand of Jamaat operative Motiur Rehman Nizami whose objective is to topple the Sheikh Hasina government.        
	The Jamaat and the Khaleda Zia-led BNP are seen as pro-Pakistan. Saifullah Qadir Chowdhury, a former BNP MP reportedly involved in triggering the mutiny, has active ISI links and is known to be close to Zias son Tarique Rahman.        
	Reports said some outposts in Bangladesh had been re-occupied by BDR troops, suggesting a return to normality could be under way.

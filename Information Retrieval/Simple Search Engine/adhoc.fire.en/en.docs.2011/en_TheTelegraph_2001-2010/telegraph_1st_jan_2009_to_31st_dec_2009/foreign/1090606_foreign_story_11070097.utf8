The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Pak blast kills 30
                                                                                                               Pak blast kills 30
                            
	Peshawar, June 5 (AP): A suicide bomber killed at least 30 people and wounded 40 attending Friday prayers at a mosque in Pakistans northwest, violence that came as the countrys leaders urged visiting US envoy Richard Holbrooke for more aid to stave off Taliban-led militancy.        
	There was no immediate claim of responsibility for the blast at the Sunni mosque in the Haya Gai area of Upper Dir, a district next to the Swat Valley where the army is carrying out an offensive against the Taliban.        
	Police said a man who some worshippers said was a stranger entered the mosque wearing an explosive vest. When they confronted him, the man blew himself up, a police officer in Upper Dir said.        
	Local police chief Ejaz Ahmad said the death toll was 30, but there are more body parts, which may make another four to six bodies and the final tally could reach 40.

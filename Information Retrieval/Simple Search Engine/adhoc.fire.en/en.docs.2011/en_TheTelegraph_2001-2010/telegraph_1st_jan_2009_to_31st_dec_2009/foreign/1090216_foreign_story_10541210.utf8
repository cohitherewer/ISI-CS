	Kathmandu, Feb. 15 (PTI): The Communist Party of Nepal-UML, a coalition partner of the Maoist-led government, will place a life-size statue of Lord Buddha at the venue of its eighth general convention near Lumbini.        
	Besides the Buddha statue, an idol of Karl Marx will also be placed at the venue.         
	The six-day convention, which begins tomorrow, will be inaugurated with a torch brought from Lumbini, the birth place of Lord Buddha, to Butwal Mandap, the convention venue, sources close to the CPN-UML said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Firms back one charger for all phones
                                                                                                               Firms back one charger for all phones
                            
	Barcelona, Feb. 17 (AFP): Leading mobile phone manufacturers today announced that they had agreed to produce a standardised charger for the industry in a move set to save money for consumers and reduce waste.        
	Currently, each mobile phone maker has its own charger design, sometimes using several across different models. This increases replacement costs for users and leads to unwanted cables when a consumer swaps brands. In a small move set to make this aspect of modern life easier, industry body the GSM Association said leading manufacturers had agreed to link up to resolve the problem.        
	The standard shape to be adopted by more than 20 manufacturers including Nokia, Motorola and Samsung is to be mini USB. The new charger will also be more energy efficient than current offerings, the GSMA said. The target is that the majority of mobile phones shipped by 2012 will support this new interface.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | BDR to get new name
                                                                                                               BDR to get new name
                            
	Dhaka, Aug. 20 (PTI): The paramilitary Bangladesh Rifles will be renamed as Border Guard Bangladesh (BGB) as part of a massive restructuring plan to help it overcome the stigma of the February 25-26 mutiny at its headquarters which left 57 army officers dead.        
	 A proposal to rename the force, change its uniform to a distinct logo and organisational structures was approved by Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina yesterday, officials said.        
	Under the restructuring, the personnel will wear a brown-coloured uniform, apparently to differentiate them from the army.

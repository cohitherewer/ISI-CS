The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Wider parking space for women
                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      Wider parking space for women
          MALCOLM MOORE                          Distance sense                                  
	Shanghai, Dec. 29: A shopping centre in the northern Chinese city of Shijiazhuang has built a car park with extra-wide spaces to accommodate female drivers.        
	The Wanxiang-Tiancheng shopping centre women-only car park has bays that are three feet wider than normal and painted in a delicate pink and light purple colour scheme.        
	Female parking attendants have been employed to guide female drivers into their berths, which are also better lit than in the ordinary car park.        
	Wang Zheng, the manager of the facility, said that the design would appeal to womens strong sense of colour and different sense of distance.        
	He said: There is a scientific basis for all this. Women have a poorer sense of distance when they are locked inside a small space. That is why female drivers often bump the front and back of their cars. There is also a 15 per cent greater chance that a woman will whack her car door into another car when she opens it.        
	One female driver interviewed by the Hebei Youth Daily newspaper said she appreciated the gesture. The driver, who was named only as Zhang, said: Female drivers just are not as good as male drivers, technically. The added space helps us to park safely. I think it shows respect for women. I hope that other facilities will take womens needs into consideration.        
	China is currently the worlds largest car market as its increasingly wealthy middle class takes to the roads. The China Association of Automobile Manufacturers expects car sales to top 13 million in 2009.

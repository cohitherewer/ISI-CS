The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Bangla pledges to uproot terror
                                                                                                                           17                                                                                      Bangla pledges to uproot terror
                            
	Dhaka, Dec. 6 (PTI): Dhaka today pledged not to allow terrorists to use its land for subversive activities, either against Bangladesh or any of its neighbours.        
	The assertion, by foreign minister Dipu Moni, comes days after Ulfa chairman Arabinda Rajkhowas reported handover to India and less than two weeks before Prime Minister Sheikh Hasinas visit to Delhi. We have pledged not to allow our land to be used by any terrorist. We are determined about it, Dipu Moni said.         
	The Awami League government, she added, will not allow terrorists to use its land for subversive activities against Bangladesh or its neighbours. Every effort will be made to eliminate terrorism originating from abroad and those emerging on our own soil, Dipu told a seminar on Indo-Bangladesh relations.        
	She steered clear of a question on whether Rajkhowa was picked up in her country, focusing on the general resolve not to allow any terrorist to use Bangladesh.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | International | Hemingways definition fits ice-cool Hudson Hero
                                                                                                               Hemingways definition fits ice-cool Hudson Hero

	New York, Jan. 16 (Reuters): New York feted its latest hero, the pilot who landed the distressed US Airways jetliner on the Hudson river, saving all 155 on board in what experts called a masterful job under life-or-death pressure.        
	Chesley Sully Sullenberger, a former US Air Force pilot and air safety consultant, had yet to appear in public one day after he brought the Airbus A320 to a textbook emergency landing on the river.        
	According to details pieced together from air traffic controllers and aviation officials with knowledge of the flight, it seemed as if the incident of several minutes passed in a flash, demanding that Sullenberger employ every bit of his 40 years of flight experience.        
	As the plane began sinking, Sullenberger walked the aisle twice to make sure no one was left behind, Bloomberg said.        
	After the crash, he was sitting there in the ferry terminal, wearing his hat, sipping his coffee and acting like nothing happened, one police source told the New York Daily News.        
	 He looked absolutely immaculate, a rescuer told the newspaper. He looked like David Niven in an airplane uniform, the rescuer said, referring to the debonair British actor. He looked unruffled.        
	Hes very controlled, very professional, the pilots wife, Lorrie, told reporters today. Hes a pilots pilot. He loves the art of the airplane.        
	New York City mayor Michael Bloomberg said: Hemingway defined heroism once as grace under pressure and I think its fair to say that Captain Sullenberger certainly displayed that yesterday. Asked what he meant by guts, Ernest Hemingway had once said: Grace under pressure.        
	This is a story of heroes, something right out of a movie script, said Bloomberg, who will present the crew with a ceremonial key to the city.        
	Bloomberg said the pilot would not be available to the media until he had finished providing information to federal investigators.        
	US transportation investigators will interview Sullenberger and review reports that the plane lost power in both engines when it struck a flock of birds shortly after take-off.        
	Experts from the National Transportation Safety Board are on scene but probably will not get their first look at the engines until the plane is hoisted from the water.

                                                                                                               Polanski extradition
                            
	Zurich, Oct. 23 (Reuters): The US has formally asked Switzerland to extradite film director Roman Polanski, who fled sentencing in California on child sex charges in 1977, the Swiss justice department said today.        
	The department said it would make a decision on extradition based on a hearing and on information provided by Polanskis lawyer.        
	In a statement, it said Polanski would be able to appeal against its decision to the Swiss Federal Criminal Court and, in the last instance, the Federal Supreme Court. The director was arrested at the request of the US.

                                                                                                               Taliban start to withdraw from Buner     -  Army readies for Swat strike
          NASIR JAFFRY AND AGENCIES                           Taliban militants leave Buner on Friday. (Reuters)                                                 
	Islamabad, April 24: Pakistani Taliban militants today began to withdraw from the northwestern district of Buner as the army reinforced expectations of an immi- nent offensive in the Swat Valley.        
	The pull out comes days after the Taliban took control of Buner, a valley just 100km and less than five hours drive from Islamabad.         
	The Taliban have started withdrawing from Buner, North West Frontier Province (NWFP) information minister Mian Iftikhar Hussain told reporters in Peshawar after an all-party conference that discussed ways to deal with the Taliban.         
	Pakistans government and Opposition leaders, including former Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif, called the Talibans takeover of Buner as a violation of a peace deal that the NWFP government had signed with hardline cleric Sufi Mohammad.        
	The withdrawal, if completed, eliminates the most immediate threat to a peace agreement in the neighbouring militant-held Swat Valley that the US government worries has created a haven for allies of the al Qaida.        
	The deal allows the Taliban to enforce Sharia in the Malakand division which comprises seven districts, including Swat.         
	Taliban spokesman Muslim Khan also confirmed that the militants were withdrawing from Buner.         
	We have already withdrawn from some areas while the complete pull out may take little more time, he said. The order for the Talibans retreat from Buner was given by Fazlullah, the Taliban commander in the Swat Valley.        
	It was unclear whether the withdrawal was in response to a carrot or a stick, and worries abound over whether Pakistan lacks the capacity and intent to fight militancy.        
	Army chief General Ashfaq Kayani issued a statement aimed at dispelling those doubts and calming a mounting sense of crisis. The army will not allow the militants to dictate terms to the government or impose their way of life on the civil society of Pakistan, the statement quoted Kayani as saying.        
	Operational pause, meant to give the reconciliatory forces a chance, must not be taken for a concession to the militants, Kayani said in a hard-hitting address to senior military commanders at the armys general headquarters in the garrison town of Rawalpindi.        
	TV images showed dozens of militants emerging today from a high-walled villa that served as their headquarters in Buner. The men, most of them masked with black scarves and carrying automatic weapons and rocket-propelled grenades, clambered into several pick-up trucks and minibuses before driving away.        
	Sufi Mohammad, who helped mediate the disputed peace deal, persuaded the Taliban to return to Swat, said Syed Mohammed Javed, the top government administrator in the region.         
	We told them that we have a deal, we have a peace agreement. We told them not to become a tool in the hands of someone aiming at sabotaging the peace in the region, Javed said by telephone from Buner.        
	Javed said he and Mohammad, were leading the Taliban convoy back to Mingora, Swats main town.

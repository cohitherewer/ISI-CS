The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Yes to talks, with a rider
                                                                                                               Yes to talks, with a rider
                            
	Calcutta, June 30: The government today said it was not averse to talking to the Peoples Committee Against Police Atrocities if the outfit made a formal proposal.         
	But home secretary Ardhendu Sen also made it clear that it would not talk to committee convener Chhatradhar Mahato, against whom cases were pending.        
	We know Mahato is not a Maoist, nor is he officially associated with the CPI (Maoist). He is simply a leader of the committee. But he is wanted under the IPC and we shall arrest him once we get him, Sen said.         
	Earlier, the government had ruled out any talks, saying they were not possible with a gun held to our head.        
	Asked why the government had earlier turned down a proposal for talks, the home secretary said: It depends on the situation. Now we are getting feedback that talks with the tribals could help improve things.         
	Mahato today appealed to the government for talks through a television channel.

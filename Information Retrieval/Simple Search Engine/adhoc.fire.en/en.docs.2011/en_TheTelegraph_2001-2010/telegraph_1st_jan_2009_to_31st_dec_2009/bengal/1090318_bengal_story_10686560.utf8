	Calcutta, March 17: Jadavpur University students who were allegedly accused of teasing women and assaulted blocked the road in front of their hostel tonight.         
	Police removed the blockade on Raja SC Mullick Road, in front of JUs main hostel, around 1am but the students continued to protest the assault and the polices alleged refusal to register an FIR.

                                                                                                               Decades on, conviction for CPM 46 
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Bolpur, March 30: A court in Birbhums Suri today convicted 46 CPM activists of killing four Naxalites 22 years ago.        
	Of the 56 chargsheeted in the case, 10 have died.        
	All the 46 were out on bail but present in court when the verdict was announced. The police hurriedly took them into custody.        
	Their sentences, to be de-livered tomorrow, could be life terms or death.        
	On the morning of November 19, 1987, a CPM procession at Muluk village in Bolpur had attacked the four Naxalite farm labourers who were in their fields.         
	The mob beat them with sticks and hacked them to death.         
	The dead were identified as Sheikh Jiauddin, Sheikh Mannan, Sudhir Ghosh and Nirmal Ghosh, supporters of the Kanu Sanyal faction of the CPI (ML).         
	This is a victory and protest against the CPMs fascist character. We had to wait 22 years for it, said Subodh Mitra, a central executive member of the Naxalite outfit.         
	CPM district committee secretary Dilip Ganguly said: We will hear the sentences and decide about appealing the order.

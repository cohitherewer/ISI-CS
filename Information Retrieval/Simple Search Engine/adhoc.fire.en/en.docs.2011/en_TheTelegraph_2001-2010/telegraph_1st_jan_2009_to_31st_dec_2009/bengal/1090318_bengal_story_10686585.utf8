The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | SUCI firm on Cong contest
                                                                                                               SUCI firm on Cong contest
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Calcutta, March 17: The SUCI today ruled out withdrawing its nine candidates against the Congress, leaving ally Mamata Banerjee upset.         
	We are not going to withdraw any of our candidates. We have told Mamata about our firm stand, SUCI state secretary Pravas Ghosh said.        
	He pointed out that the party had not fielded candid- ates against the Congress alone. Our candidates are also fighting the CPM in six of the nine seats. Jhargram, Bolpur, Burdwan-Durgapur, Purulia, Bankura and Jalpaiguri are all traditional Left bastions.        
	The Congress holds two of the nine seats  Murshidabad and Raiganj. Malda North, the other seat where Mamatas allies are locking horns, is a new constituency but the area is a Congress stronghold.         
	The SUCI leader was confident that the partys stand would not strain its relations with Mamata. We are a partner in the Trinamul-led secular democratic front. We have nothing to do with the Congress, which has forged an electoral understanding with Mamata. Our alliance with Mamata will remain intact, he said.        
	A Trinamul functionary said Mamata was upset over the SUCIs decision. She had requested them to pull out the candidates to ensure that anti-CPM votes were not split, state party president Subrata Bakshi said.        
	A section of the Congress now wants to field a candidate in Joynagar, a seat Mamata has left to the SUCI. Sources said state Congress president Pranab Mukherjee would speak to the Trinamul leader on the SUCI stand on Saturday.         
	State Congress working president Pradip Bhattacharya said Mamata should sever her ties with the SUCI if it turned down her request to withdraw the candidates.         
	Khejuri death        
	Himadri Patra, 48, a CPM leader who had joined Trinamul during last years rural polls, has been murdered in East Midnapores Khejuri.

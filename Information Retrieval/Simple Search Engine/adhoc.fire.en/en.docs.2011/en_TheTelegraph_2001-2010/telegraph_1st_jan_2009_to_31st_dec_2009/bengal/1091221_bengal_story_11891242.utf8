          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Jhargram, Dec. 20: Two suspected Maoists were shot dead by security forces near Jhargram during a gun battle that injured at least seven villagers caught in the crossfire.        
	A mob had surrounded police, protesting arrests at a place where mines were found this afternoon, when the guerrillas opened fire from an adjoining forest.         
	The Maoists tried to put the villagers in the line of fire, an officer said. Shots rang out as we started lobbing tear-gas shells to drive the villagers away.        
	The tear gas may have saved scores of other villagers from getting caught between flying bullets.        
	The encounter on the fringes of Boira forest, 12km from Jhargram town, started around 3.30pm and continued till 9 at night.        
	The police identified the slain duo as Maoists Santu Mahato, 26, and Kajol Mahato, 22.         
	The Peoples Committee Against Police Atrocities said they were its leaders, killed when the police fired indiscriminately at villagers.        
	Santus body has been retrieved but Kajols was lying deeper in the Boira forest till late tonight.        
	During a patrol along a state highway that connects Kharagpur with Jhargram, the joint forces learnt that mines had been planted near Boira. Two companies (around 200 personnel) went there with a bomb squad and defused two improvised devices around 3pm.         
	Fifteen minutes after the force had picked up two men on suspicion that they may have planted the mines, 500 villagers surrounded them.         
	Tonight, the injured were taken to the Midnapore Medical College and Hospital, about 50km away.        
	Doctors said none of them was in a critical condition.        
	Earlier in the day, Maoists shot dead two CPM members about 10km from Boira.        
	Before leaving, they left behind posters saying Jatindranath Mahato, 65, and Manik Midya, 45, had been given the death sentence in a peoples court because they were police informers.        
	At Baladduba village, neighbour Abhoy Mahato said over 100 people had surrounded Jatindranaths house and called him out. Another group raided Jitushole village around the same time for Manik.        
	Jatindranath had refused to flee home despite threats. Being the only earning member of his family, he couldnt afford to run away, said CPM district secretariat member Dahareswar Sen.         
	Canning murder        
	A CPM member of the South 24-Parganas zilla parishad was killed during his morning walk. Mosaraf Khan, 52, was hacked and shot in Canning, 55km from Calcutta.         
	The party blamed the Trinamul Congress for the murder and called a 12-hour bandh in the area on Monday.         
	The police said he had left home at 5am and no one saw him being killed. His body was found near his house.

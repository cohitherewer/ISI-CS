The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Minus middle name, Ambika turns Ms
                                                                                                               Minus middle name, Ambika turns Ms
          OUR BUREAU                          Ambika Banerjee                                  
	June 2: A dropped middle name may or may not have helped Ambika Banerjee win the election but it almost robbed him of his gender today.        
	Ms Ambika Banerjee, called out P.D.T. Achary, the Lok Sabha secretary-general, in the House while new MPs were being sworn in.        
	Out of the aisle stepped a bespectacled octogenarian, nothing in his appearance to suggest that he is not a mister.        
	Is he Ambika? an incredulous Achary asked an aide who confirmed that the gentleman was indeed the Trinamul Congresss Howrah MP.        
	Apparently, a printers error on the list of MPs caused the confusion but Achary, who hails from Kerala where two Ambikas were leading ladies in different eras, can be forgiven for thinking that the MP was a woman.         
	Not to mention the more familiar Ambika  Ambika Soni, the minister.        
	The confusion could have been avoided had the 81-year-old Trinamul MP retained the full name  Ambika Prasad Banerjee  by which he was known till 1999. After the Lok Sabha poll defeat that year, he dropped the Prasad but it is not clear if the omission had anything to do with the result.        
	Family members said Ba-nerjees paternal uncle Lalit Mohan Bandopadhyay had christened him Ambika Prasad. But my brother-in-law dropped Prasad from his name after he lost the elections, said Indrani, wife of Banerjees younger brother.        
	Even Mamata Banerjee is said to have requested the MP to change his name when she met party MPs after their swearing-in. Ambikada, you better change your name, she was quoted as saying.        
	Not that anything is wrong with Ambika, which means motheror mother dear.         
	But an addition  like Prasad or Nath  makes gender identification easier. The word Ambikanath (husband of Ambika) refers to Shiva in the Samsad dictionary.         
	In the Markandeya Purana, Kali emerges from Ambikas brow. The Yajur Veda identifies Ambika as Rudras sister. In the Mahabharat, Ambika was the mother of Dhritarashtra.         
	The Ambika in question the Trinamul MP  was a Congress MLA from Central Howrah in the early 1970s. He joined Trinamul ahead of the 2006 Assembly polls but lost to the CPM in the Howrah seat.

	Midnapore, Nov. 9: Former Sankrail officer-in-charge Atindranath Dutta reported for duty at the police lines here today only to hear that no work will be assigned to him till the completion of a probe into the circumstances surrounding his abduction by Maoists and his subsequent release.        
	The officer has been closed, said West Midnapore police chief Manoj Verma.         
	When an officer is closed  the term originating from the British legacy of confining an officer close to the armoury of a police station for an investigation  he has to report for duty everyday even if no specific tasks are assigned to him.         
	Dutta, a senior officer said, will have to report to the Reserve Office of the police lines and stay in the barracks.         
	The probe now under way is also looking into his role in running the Sankrail police station. His role as an administrator and conduct just before he was abducted and after his release (are being looked into), an officer said in Calcutta. Charges of insubordination soon after his release and violation of the police code by speaking to the media without permission are being probed.        
	During Duttas stay at the barracks, his movement will be monitored, an officer said. However, he will draw his salary and allowances as usual.        
	Maoists had shot dead two of Duttas colleagues and abducted him on October 20. He was released on October 22.        
	Today, Dutta reached Midnapore town around 1.30pm with wife Indrani, daughter Oindrakshi and his parents.         
	When media personnel approached them for comments outside the police lines gates, cops chased them away.         
	Encounter        
	Security forces had an eight-hour gun battle with Maoists about 25km from Midnapore town today.        
	Central forces had to be rushed into a forest in the Kotwali area after a group of 40 jawans came under heavy fire. However, no casualties were reported. Over 30 villagers have been detained for questioning.        
	Maoists shot and injured CPM leader Jagannath Mahato, 45, in Salboni. One bullet hit him in the stomach while another grazed his lips.

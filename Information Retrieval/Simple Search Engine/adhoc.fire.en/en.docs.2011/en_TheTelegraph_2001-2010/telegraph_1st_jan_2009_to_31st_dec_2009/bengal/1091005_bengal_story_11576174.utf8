The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Langurs stall train
                                                                                                               Langurs stall train
                            
	Chinsurah, Oct. 4: Political activists who like blocking railway tracks can now have simians for company.        
	Some 50 langurs sat on the tracks near Kuntighat station in Hooghly and blocked a train for 45 minutes today. They seemed to be protesting the injury to a herd member  a langur whose tail got snipped by a train.        
	The monkey was injured around 6.30am and forest officials were alerted around 7.15. But they said they would not go to the station before evening as it was a Sunday. Locals took the langur to a nearby hospital.         
	When it was brought back to the station at 3.30pm, it had friends waiting. The animals stalled a Katwa-bound train, prompting people to alert the authorities. When they refused to budge, dozens of bananas were brought. The monkeys left at 4.15pm after the treat.

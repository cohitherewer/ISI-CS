	Calcutta, Sept. 2: Housing minister Gautam Deb today said the government and the CPM were seriously concerned about Vedic Villages land deals as the mafia was at work there, and contrasted them with the way in which plots were taken in Rajarhat by his department.        
	No guns and goons were used in New Town, Deb said. Ours was a policy of inclusion, where every political party had a role to play in acquiring the land so development work moved ahead easily.        
	He did not name Abdur Rezzak Mollah, but spoke of his distaste for the manner in which the land and land reforms department had handled the Vedic Village deals.         
	Around 6,807 acres in Rajarhat are under the possession of Hidco (Housing Infrastructure Development Corporation), of which 250 acres were directly purchased while the rest was acquired, Deb said.         
	While doing this, we didnt require lathis, tear gas or bullets as I had involved all political parties in the development committees formed. We didnt allow goondas to rule the roost. But it appears there was some foul play in the case of Vedic Village because of the presence of land sharks.        
	As an extension of his policy of inclusive development, Deb sought co-operation and not confrontation with Mamata Banerjee for state projects. For me, there should be co-operation and competition. I want a programme of mine to be attended by Pranab Mukherjee, Mamata and our chief minister, he said.        
	Asked about allegations of coercion when he took land in Rajarhat, Deb said: There was no coercion. There were court cases but Hidco won all of them.        
	With his statement on Vedic Village, Deb officially brought to the surface the differences between him and Mollah on the crucial issue of land, political circles said.        
	Mollah has invited criticism from sections of the government and the CPM for his out-of-court settlement with the promoters of Vedic Village and handing them over 44 acres of government land at a throwaway price.         
	Deb refused to be drawn into it today. He is a senior minister and party leader. He runs the land department and knows it better than me. Rezzakda has submitted a report to our party. We will go through it, discuss it and let you know our views. The government will speak from Writers Buildings, he told a news conference at his New Secretariat office.        
	On Mollahs demand that the proposed IT township on 1,200 acres involving the Vedic promoters and a government agency be scrapped, the housing minister said: We have to discuss it in the party. But if unfair practices are adopted in land deals, the project will have to be scrapped.        
	Deb, who has his differences with Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee as well, today sounded as one expressing confidence in the chief ministers handling of the Vedic fiasco. The chief minister cant always talk to the media on various issues. But his attitude on Vedic Village is manifest in the statements of the chief secretary and the home secretary. The chief minister has said all details pertaining to the resort will be unearthed. He has made it clear that the government will go to any length for this.        
	Political observers interpreted Debs praise for Bhattacharjee as a bid to taint Mollahs image in the party and mar his chances of moving up its hierarchy.         
	Deb criticised Mamata for having questioned his phone calls to the Trinamul Congress MLA from Bhangar, Arabul Islam.         
	Arabul is the chairman of the Rajarhat-South 24-Parganas Neighbourhood Development Committee and has got projects worth Rs 22 lakh cleared by Hidco. Whats wrong if he comes to us for development work? he asked.

          BISWAJIT ROY                          Chairs that were tossed at the mayors felicitation programme in Siliguri on Thursday. Picture by Kundan Yolmo                                        
	Calcutta, Oct. 1: The CPM today made conciliatory noises about the Congress, hoping to widen the breach caused by the way the Left voted in the Siliguri Municipal Corporation.        
	We do distinguish between the Congress and Trinamul just as we do between the Congress and the BJP, despite our criticism of the Congress, CPM state secretariat member Benoy Konar said a few hours after the Congress bagged two key posts in the corporation with the Lefts help.        
	We will join hands with the Congress and other democratic forces to oppose the fascist politics of Trinamul, which is out to murder our cadres and supporters with the help of Maoists, Konar added.        
	Minister Asok Bhattacharya, the CPM heavyweight in Siliguri who first got the feelers, went a step further. Obviously, we will welcome it if the Siliguri development is the beginning of the end of the Congress-Trinamul alliance, he said.        
	CPM leaders admitted that the Opposition stand-off in Siliguri came as a godsend when the ruling Left is haunted by the spectre of losing power to a united Opposition.        
	However, CPM leaders and allies were cautious in their optimism that the Siliguri model would help undo the damage done when the Left snapped ties with the Congress before the Lok Sabha elections. It is too early to say whether Siliguri will shape larger political equations, said the CPMs Rabin Deb.         
	Yesterday, after Asok Bhattacharya got feelers from the Congress, Alimuddin Street wasted no time.        
	The party state secretariat met last evening in the presence of chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee to take stock of the Siliguri development and the ball started rolling at the national and state level after Mamata Banerjee was spurned by the Congress, sources said.         
	She rushed to Delhi apparently to demand the dismissal of the state government. It was a camouflage. She had gone to put pressure on the Congress for the Siliguri mayors post but the high command refused to gift it to her. We got the signal when even K. Keshava Rao (the Congress in-charge for Bengal) didnt meet her, said a CPM leader.         
	Other CPM sources said finance minister Asim Dasgupta had broached the issue with Pranab Mukherjee during a meeting in Delhi on instructions from chief minister Bhattacharjee and state CPM secretary Biman Bose.        
	However, two versions are doing the rounds on whether CPM central leaders concurred with the Bengal unit. One section said the decision to support the Congress from outside was taken with the agreement of the central leaders.        
	But some others claimed that CPM general secretary Prakash Karat and senior member Sitaram Yechury were informed of the matter but a discussion would be held on the sidelines of the politburo meeting next week.         
	Bose said the Congress was supported to end the political uncertainty surrounding the formation of the civic board.        
	But RSP veteran Kshiti Goswami said: Asokbabu informed our district leaders this morning that the CPM had decided to support the Congress for tactical reasons as it wanted to aggravate the crisis in the Opposition alliance.        
	Front partners RSP and CPI, which have one councillor each in Siliguri, resented the support to the Congress while the Forward Bloc agreed with the CPM.        
	Politics is not all about tactics. We were opposed to supporting the Congress principally. Second, Mamata has a valid ground to blame us as we had lost the peoples mandate, Goswami said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Concern in Cong over alliance
                                                                                                               Concern in Cong over alliance
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Calcutta, April 3: Congress general secretary K. Keshava Rao today expressed concern about some party workers reluctance to campaign jointly with the Trinamul Congress.        
	It seems the alliance has not percolated down to the grassroots. Identify those who are skipping joint campaigns and ensure that leaders in every district work in tandem with their Trinamul counterparts, Rao, who made a brief stopover at Calcutta airport on the way to Delhi from the Andamans, was quoted as telling state Congress leaders.        
	A section of the Congress has been upset after Trinamul offered it only 14 of the 42 Lok Sabha seats in Bengal.         
	Rao, the Congress leader in charge of Bengal, spoke to state party working president Pradip Bhattacharya and legislature party leader Manas Bhuniya for nearly an hour this afternoon about how the alliance was doing.         
	There is no denying that problems exist over the pact with Trinamul in some districts. But we are confident that all this would be sorted out, he told reporters later.        
	Last week, Mamata Banerjee had complained to state Congress president Pranab Mukherjee about Abdul Mannan of Hooghly and Shankar Singh of Nadia. They have been staying away from the Trinamul candidates campaigns in Hooghly, Serampore and Krishnagar.        
	Rao was also apparently worried about Congress activists reluctance to help out their former party man Somen Mitra, the Trinamul candidate from Diamond Harbour.

	Siliguri, March 3: Thirty-two teams will be participating in the second Indo-Bhutan Friendship Car Rally that will head for Thimpu from Siliguri on March 5. The rally will kick-start a series of international events organised under the Paris-based Federation of de Automobile (FIA) for this year.        
	The FIA chose the friendship rally as its first international event in 2009. In fact, this is FIAs only event in India this year. The rally is not just a competition but an initiative to strengthen the bond and promote economic ties between India and Bhutan, said Subroto Karr, additional clerk of course for the event.        
	The event is being organised jointly by the Indo-Bhutan Friendship Car Rally Association, Bengal Motors Sports Club and Kalinga Motors Sports Club.        
	The rally that was flagged off from Nicco Park in Calcutta on March 2 will turn into a competition only in Siliguri. In the course of their 500km long journey, the participants will traverse through varying landscapes  smooth national and state highways, forest roads, countryside and mountainous terrain.        
	This route that covers the forests of north Bengal and the mountain tracks of Bhutan is touted as one of the most adventurous time-speed-distance (TSD) motor sports event, Jay P. Majumdar, chief organiser of the event, said. According to the TSD format, the teams will have to cover a fixed distance in a specified time and at a certain speed.        
	The rallyists will cover the first leg of the journey from Siliguri to Phuentsholing (300km) on March 5 and the second leg from there to Thimpu (200km) on March 6.        
	Comprised mostly of amateurs, each team will have a driver and a navigator. While 20 teams are from India, the rest of the 12 are from Bhutan. The total prize money is Rs 2 lakh and will be awarded to winners as they reach Thimpu, Shyamal Palchoudhury, the co-ordinator of the association in north Bengal, said.         
	The friendship rally, which was held for the first time in February 2007, could not be organised last year. The year 2008 was a busy time in Bhutan with the centenary celebration of the monarchy and the coronation of the new king, Majumdar said.        
	Tomorrow, all the cars will be checked and necessary documents be scrutinised according to FIA and Federation of Motor Sports Club of India guidelines. Karr said external affairs minister Pranab Mukherjee and the king and the prime minister of Bhutan will be present at the award ceremony in Thimpu.

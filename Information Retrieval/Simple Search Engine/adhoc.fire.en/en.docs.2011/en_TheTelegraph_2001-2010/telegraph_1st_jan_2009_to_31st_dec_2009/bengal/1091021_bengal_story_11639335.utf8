The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Time to be harsh, says CM
                                                                                                               Time to be harsh, says CM
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Calcutta, Oct. 20: Hours before the Maoists struck today, chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee apparently told a cabinet core committee meeting his government had to be harsh on Maoists and their associates given the ground realities.        
	Some of the CPMs allies are opposed to the use of the central anti-terror law against the Left extremists, but Bhattacharjee told the meeting his government could not afford to be toothless.         
	Im told that certain questions are being raised on the implementation of the Unlawful Activities Prevention Act (UAPA) in our state. (But) just see what the Maoists are doing. Innocent people are being killed. Should a government sit back and watch such incidents or take stern steps against the killers and those associated with them?         
	Our government cant afford to be toothless. Given the ground realities and the killings by the Maoists, harsh measures are required. The UAPA has to be invoked against the offenders and thats a fait accompli, the chief minister was quoted as saying.        
	According to an official, it was RSP minister Kshiti Goswami who raised his partys reservations about the draconian act at this mornings meeting. Our Left Front government had earlier said the Maoists would be fought politically and that their organisations wouldnt be banned. Now people with alleged Maoist links or members of their groups are being booked under the UAPA. This is a draconian law and our party is opposed to it. Why arent provisions of the IPC (Indian Penal Code) or the CrPC (Criminal Procedure Code) being used to charge them? Goswami was learnt to have told the chief minister.        
	However, two other allies interrupted him. Forward Bloc minister Naren De and the Socialist Partys Kiranmoy Nanda were learnt to have said that a strict law was the need of the hour to combat insurgents and extremists.        
	Kshitida, people are being ruthlessly killed by the Maoists and you are questioning the action against them by invoking the UAPA? I think the chief minister is right, Nanda was quoted as saying.         
	Finance minister Asim Dasgupta of the CPM butted in, saying the government could not stay an onlooker when murders are being committed at will and almost every day.        
	The chief minister also stressed that his government could not ask Delhi to keep Bengal out of the offensive being planned against the Maoists. Other states hit by guerrilla violence  like Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand and Orissa  will all be covered by the crackdown.         
	I am told that the army wont be deployed and the pa- ramilitary will launch the offensive. If all states agree to such a central operation, why should we oppose it? the chief minister asked.         
	The incidents in Jharkhand and Bihar are having an effect on our state. We, too, have a responsibility to combat the crimes for which the central action is being planned. Being in power, I cant tolerate such killings, he added.        
	PWD minister Goswami refused to divulge the details of the meeting. But he said: My exchanges with the chief minister on the UAPA were frank and good. Buddhababu explained the governments position. I stuck to my partys.

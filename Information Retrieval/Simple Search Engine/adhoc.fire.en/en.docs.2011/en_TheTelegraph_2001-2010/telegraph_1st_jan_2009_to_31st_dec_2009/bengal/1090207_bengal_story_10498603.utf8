	State government employees will get the allowance  equivalent to 6 per cent of the basic pay and dearness pay taken together  with their salary in March.         
	Finance minister Asim Dasgupta said 4.3 lakh pensioners would also get the benefit. There will also be a corresponding increase in relief on pension for 4.3 lakh pensioners, he said. The allowance would cost the state exchequer Rs 63 crore.        
	The instalment was due since July 2007. Mangalmoy Ghosh, the general secretary of the State Government Trinamul Employees Federation, said: We have not got DA since July 2007 but will get one instalment in March.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Birth outside hospital 
                                                                                                               Birth outside hospital 
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Malda, Feb. 5: A woman gave birth to a child outside a block health centre in a Malda village, prompting the local people to launch a protest.        
	Karpur Chand Chowdhury of Saqullapara in Kaliachak said his wife Niria had labour pain last evening and was rushed to the block health centre at Bangitola.        
	This morning, Niria found the toilet of the centre dirty and moved to a field to relieve herself. There she delivered the baby and fell unconscious. But no one from health centre came to her rescue, Chowdhury, a fish trader, said. After a long wait, the woman was, however, taken in.        
	As the news spread, members of the Ganga Bhangon Nagorik Protirodh Committee demonstrated at the health centre. The health centre is in bad shape. It needs immediate repair. A stench emanates from the toilets. The cots are broken and shabby, Khidir Box, the secretary of the committee, said.        
	Box alleged that repeated appeals to the higher authorities to improve the condition of the health centre went unheeded. Even though four doctors are posted, they are seldom seen, he said.        
	Chief medical officer of heath Srikanta Roy said he had not received any report on the Bangitola incident. He, however, admitted that the health centre was in a dilapidated condition. A new building is being constructed but that cannot justify for dirty toilets. I will enquire it from the block officer.        
	Block medical officer of health Sagar Saha appeared helpless. Lower rung employees do not perform their duties regularly. We cannot take any step against them because of the unions, he said.

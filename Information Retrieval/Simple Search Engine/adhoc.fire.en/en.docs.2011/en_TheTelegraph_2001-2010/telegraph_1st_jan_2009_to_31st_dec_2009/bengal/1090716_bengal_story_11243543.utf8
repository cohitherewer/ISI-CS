The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Morcha wants early talks
                                                                                                               Morcha wants early talks
                            
	Darjeeling, July 15: The Gorkha Janmukti Morcha today virtually rejected the August 24 talks offer made by the Centre and said they should be held before the budget session of Parliament ended on August 7.        
	It dubbed the Union home ministrys letter proposing the tripartite meeting also involving the Bengal government a ruse to get the outfit to withdraw the indefinite strike in the Darjeeling hills. We have received the letter and we demand that the tripartite meeting be held with the sole agenda of Gorkhaland at a political level before the end of the current session of Parliament, said Binay Tamang, a Morcha assistant secretary.         
	In Delhi, home minister officials declined comment on the demand, saying the Morcha had to convey it formally.        
	The hill outfit accused the Centre of being vague on the purpose of the meeting. The letter merely says a tripartite meeting will be held on August 24. It does not specify the agenda of the meeting or its venue. It is also silent on the people who will be invited to the talks. We believe that this is just a ploy to get us to withdraw the indefinite strike, added Tamang.         
	He iterated that the Morcha would not sit for a discussion on anything apart from Gorkhaland and ruled out calling off the bandh unless it was satisfied with the tripartite meeting.

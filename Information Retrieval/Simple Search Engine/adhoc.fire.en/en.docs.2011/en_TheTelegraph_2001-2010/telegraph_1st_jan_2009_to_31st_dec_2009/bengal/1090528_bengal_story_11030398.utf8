	Kultali (South 24-Parganas), May 27: Last night, Manikjan Mullick had gone to sleep with the thought that it would be three days before she could return to her village and rebuild her home with the money the chief minister promised to deliver within three days.        
	But when she woke up this morning and heard that the water had receded from Gangadhar Palli, she couldnt resist the temptation of going home, money or no money.         
	I didnt want to wait when I heard the water had receded, said the 50-year-old widow. I dont even know if that money will ever reach us. The chief minister also promised us clean water, but did we get it? We had to make do with the muddy water from the tube well at the college (relief camp).        
	Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee had told the villagers not to drink this water when he saw them lined up before the tube well during a trip to the relief camp yesterday. He will provide you with clean water, he had said, pointing to the block development officer.         
	The money to rebuild their homes, the chief minister vowed, would arrive within three days.         
	Wary that it could be as illusory as the clean water, the family of 10 trudged home through muck, a foot deep in some places. With Manikjan was her son Shahid, who is down with fever since being drenched during cyclone Ailas Monday mayhem.        
	The site that greeted the family after an hours trek left them cold: one side of the house had crumbled, the thatched roof was gone, the clay oven was broken and the utensils lay scattered all around.        
	When I left the college (relief camp), there was some hope in my heart and a feeling of comfort that I was returning to my home, Manikjan said.         
	But I never expected this. There is no food, everything has been washed away. Nor is there any roof over our head.        
	Standing amid the ruins, she realised what their plight could be if it rained again. And it did start raining in the evening.         
	A patch of asbestos roof that survived the 120kmph beast and was hanging over an open verandah was their only hope.        
	They were not the only ones to leave the college today, hoping to pick up the pieces before the chief ministers promised aid arrived. All the 400-odd Gangadhar Palli residents who had taken shelter in the college left the camp but rebuilding proved tougher than what they had bargained for.        
	The men got busy rebuilding the embankment that had caved in and repairing the approach road. Others went with pails to collect water from the only tube well in the village, which had got submerged during the cyclone-fed floods.        
	I dont know whether we were right in leaving the college today, but I suppose we had to start rebuilding our homes, said Halima Bibi, 35, whose main task now is to fend for her four children.        
	I hope the chief minister keeps his word. It will make such a difference, she said.        
	If what district magistrate Khalil Ahmed said is correct, the chief minister is unlikely to keep his three-day promise. Ahmed said BDOs had been told to prepare a list of the ben-eficiaries. This will take an- other two days, after which we will send the list to Writers Buildings for disbursement of the funds, he added.

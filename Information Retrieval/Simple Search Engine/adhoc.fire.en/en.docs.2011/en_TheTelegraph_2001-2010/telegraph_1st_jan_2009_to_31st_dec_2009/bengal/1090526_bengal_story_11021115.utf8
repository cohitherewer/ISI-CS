The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Why Aila did not go to Bangla
                                                                                                               Why Aila did not go to Bangla

	All you wanted to know about cyclones without having to search the Internet. G.S. Mudur replies to frequently asked questions in Calcutta on Monday.               
	What is a cyclone?         
	A cyclone is a tropical storm with circular winds and a relatively calm core  the eye of the storm  that forms over the oceans and gains intensity until it strikes the coast, an event known as landfall.         
	Aila was a 250-350km wide beast with wind speeds exceeding 120kmph that was born high over the Bay of Bengal four days ago and was pulled by a monsoon trough northward.               
	How did it originate? Why is there so much of wind when a cyclone strikes?         
	It started as a low pressure zone in the atmosphere that built up into a fullblown cyclone. Its genesis was driven by key conditions  sea temperatures greater than 26C to a depth of 60metres that provided enough water vapour through evaporation and high relative humidity in the atmosphere up to 7,000 metres altitude, allowing water vapour to condense into droplets and clouds, releasing heat energy which in turn leads to a drop in pressure. Cyclone formation also depends on the development of massive vertical cumulus cloud and on the Earths rotation.               
	How long does it usually last? What happens to it eventually?         
	The lifespan of a tropical cyclone is typically about four to six days. A cyclone begins to weaken after landfall because its source of warm moist air  the sea or ocean  gets abruptly cut off and because of increased friction between wind and land. But Aila actually gained intensity after landfall at Sagar Island this afternoon. A large core sometimes delays weakening. This is what scientists believe happened on Monday. But as it moved further over land, it weakened rapidly to turn into a depression and is expected to dissipate.               
	Why was this one called Aila?         
	The name Aila is among eight names for cyclones submitted by the Maldives. Cyclones in the northern Indian Ocean began getting names from 2004. They are picked from a list of 64 names  eight names submitted by each of the eight countries with coasts along the Arabian Sea or the Bay of Bengal. The names are picked in sequence, one name after the other from each country in alphabetical order. The previous cyclone was named Bijli that lasted from April 14 to April 17 this year. It is possible Aila is a popular name in the Maldives. The language of the Maldives, Dhivehi, does not appear to have such a word. A dynasty of kings in ancient India was called Aila. In Hebrew, the word means oak tree.         
	The next cyclone, when it forms, will be called Phyan  a name submitted by Myanmar.              
	Are there some safety tips to be followed when cyclone strikes?         
	Doors and windows should be secured. Taping down windows provides no protection to the glass or against flying debris. Metal shutters used in markets are best to protect windows or glass. If metal shutters arent practical, wooden boards nailed into the frames could help. Disaster management experts say people should try and stay home.              
	Did the cyclone actually touch Calcutta?        
	Yes. The peripheral or outer spiralling winds of Aila began to lash the city in the morning before landfall occurred at Sagar Island in the afternoon. These outer winds had speeds of over 120-kmph. The size of the cyclonic system was so large that when the core crossed the coast, the city was already experiencing its winds.                 
	Can it strike Calcutta again?         
	Not this cyclone. It is dying out. Most cyclones rapidly weaken after landfall which usually translates into lower wind speeds for Calcutta. But a 100-year analysis of Bay of Bengal cyclones shows that 23 cyclones have struck 24 Parganas  the highest number of cyclones in that period among any other site on Indias east coast.                 
	Usually, cyclones bypass Calcutta and go to Bangladesh. Why was it different this time?         
	An atmospheric tug of war, among other things, determines which way a cyclone will move. Its direction is determined by the steering flow in the upper atmosphere. A strong westerly wind flow would tend to push a Bay of Bengal cyclone east, towards Bangladesh, while a monsoon trough would pull the cyclone in a northwest or north direction. The westerly wind was not prominent this time. So the effect of the monsoon trough took over and the cyclone moved north.               
	How powerful are cyclone winds?        
	Aila had winds exceeding 120kmph, but there have been stronger cyclones. Cyclone Sidr of November 2007 had wind of 250kmph. Wind speed on a normal day would be about 10kmph to 15kmph. A 25kmph day would be considered very windy.              
	What damage can the winds do?         
	Wind speeds of less than 115kmph can tear branches off trees, pull down shallow-rooted trees, damage billboards, slam windows and doors shut and break glass. Speeds of 116kmph to 180kmph can blow moving automobiles off roads, damage homes, and uproot larger trees and poles.               
	Has the frequency and intensity of cyclones gone up in recent times?         
	Yes. Global warming is contributing to an increase in the frequency of extreme events, and there are signals that the intensity and frequency of cyclones is also increasing. The higher the temperature of the ocean, the greater the energy content available for a cyclone, and the more intense it can become, said B.N. Goswami, director of the Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology, Pune.               
	Is the expression calm before the storm reflect a weather phenomenon or is it just a turn of phrase?         
	The core of a cyclonic storm is a relatively quiet zone, surrounded by the spiralling bands of winds. As a storm passes, an area will experience the front part of the spiral band, move into the core when there is a lull in the storm activity, and then experience the rear winds which are just as strong as the ones on the other side of the spiral.

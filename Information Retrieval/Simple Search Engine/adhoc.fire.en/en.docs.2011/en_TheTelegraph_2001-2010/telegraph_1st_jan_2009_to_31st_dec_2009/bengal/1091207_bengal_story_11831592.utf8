	Dec. 6: Two CPM activists were today found with their heads severed from the torsos in a paddy field in West Midnapores Sabong.        
	However, the duo  Bholanath Khutia, 45, the deputy chief of a gram panchayat, and party activist Gurupada Mondal, 43  were residents of Moyna, about 70km away in neighbouring East Midnapore.        
	After the Lok Sabha elections this year, Khutia joined the CPM, though he had won last years panchayat poll on a Trinamul ticket. The bodies did not have clothes on them. They were lying in a jungle, said West Midnapore police chief Manoj Verma.        
	Neighbour Gayaram Mondal said: Both had the habit of staying away from their homes for long periods. When they left on a motorcycle yesterday, there was nothing unusual.        
	Trinamul claimed Bhola-nath was an arms dealer. The CPM alleged that Trinamul killed the duo to spread terror.

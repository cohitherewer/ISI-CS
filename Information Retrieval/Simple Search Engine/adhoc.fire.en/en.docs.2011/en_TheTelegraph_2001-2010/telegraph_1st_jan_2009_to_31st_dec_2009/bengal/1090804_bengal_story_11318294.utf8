The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | To tell or not to tell mentor Basu
                                                                                                               To tell or not to tell mentor Basu
          OUR BUREAU                              
	Calcutta, Aug. 3: For much of this morning, the CPM leadership was left wondering how to break the news to Jyoti Basu.        
	It was hard, like conveying the news of a sons death to a father, said a CPM leader.        
	Only days ago, Subhas Chakraborty had come to the same hospital where he died today to see the 95-year-old Basu.        
	Some in the CPM felt Basu shouldnt be informed about the death at all. Others knew too well that he could not do without newspapers in the morning.        
	So state party secretary Biman Bose took the task on himself.         
	Jyotibabu was shocked and stunned, said his aide Joykrishna Ghosh.         
	I should have died at this ripe age instead of Subhas. A young, active and energetic party worker passed away when I have to slog along, Ghosh quoted Basu as saying. Basu, never known for public display of emotions, was apparently speechless for few minutes.         
	According to Ghosh, Basu later called up Chakrabortys wife Ramala and urged her to keep her calm.         
	Chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee said: We worked together in the party and the government. He had an extraordinary organisational capability. His administrative ability is also well known.         
	Former Lok Sabha Speaker Somnath Chatterjee, who went to Chakrabortys house, said: From the partys viewpoint, he (Chakraborty) appeared controversial at times. But later he was found to be cor-rect. Chakraborty had opposed Chatter- jees expulsion from the CPM and demanded his readmission.        
	Mamata Banerjee called him a leader of great stature. His death is a loss to the state. Union finance minister Pranab Mukherjee called it an irreparable loss for the CPM. Governor Gopalkrishna Gandhi hailed him as a mass leader.

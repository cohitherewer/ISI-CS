	Calcutta, Sept. 7: Mamata Banerjee has decided to bring a Muslim student leader of Calcutta University to helm the Trinamul Congress student wing, keeping up her efforts to please the community which helped her win all elections since last years rural polls.        
	Abul Kalam will replace Baiswanar Chatterjee as the president of the partys student wing. The announcement will be made in two-three days, a Trinamul general secretary said.        
	Kalam, who completed his MA in Arabic from Calcutta University this year, said he had been with the Trinamul Chhatra Parishad since the outfits inception in 1998.         
	Asked if his target would be to try and draw minority students towards Trinamul, he said: Yes. Im confident of bringing many Muslims into our fold.        
	In a state where over 26 per cent of the voters are Muslim, over a third of the 400-odd undergraduate colleges are in minority-dominated areas. The CPM student wing, SFI, controls over 300 of the colleges now and Trinamuls writ runs only in about 16.         
	Attending an iftar last evening, Mamata announced her move to allow writing railway job exams in Urdu or any re-gional language. Her head wrapped in a scarf, she also announced the September 12 flagging off of a daily train from Sealdah to Ajmer Sharif.        
	Observers said she was keen to hold on to the new-found support of the community.        
	Chatterjee said he was not complaining about Kalams elevation, but some of Mamatas other organisational changes have apparently left sections of the party unhappy.        
	The decision to make Tamluk MP Subhendu Adhikari the Trinamul Youth Congress chief in place of Madan Mitra has angered some in Calcutta. Mitras sidelining will hurt our movements in the city. It is not possible for Subhendu to come over to Calcutta every now and then, said a leader.        
	The choice of Somen Mitra as Trinamul spokesman and Naxalite leader Purnendu Boses elevation as president of the partys labour arm have also not gone down well with the ranks.         
	Railway minister Mamata has decided to stay back in Calcutta for about a fortnight, apparently to smooth the ruffled feathers and continue recasting the party organisation.         
	The civic polls in Calcutta are due next year and it is likely to be a warm-up for the Assembly elections in 2011.

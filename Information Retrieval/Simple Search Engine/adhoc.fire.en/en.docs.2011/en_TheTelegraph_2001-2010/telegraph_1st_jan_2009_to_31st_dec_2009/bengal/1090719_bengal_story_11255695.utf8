The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Cong bid to wrest Opposition mantle
                                                                                                               Cong bid to wrest Opposition mantle
          OUR BUREAU                              
	July 18: Buoyed by its success in enforcing Fridays bandh, the Congress today announced a string of agitation programmes including a march to Writers Buildings to keep the Mangalkot issue on the boil and help it reshape its future as a credible Opposition party.        
	We shall keep mounting pressure on the government until those involved in the attack on our nine MLAs in Mangalkot are punished, said state Congress working president Subrata Mukherjee, whose party has been largely seen as riding piggyback on the Trinamul Congress so far.        
	In contrast, Trinamul chief Mamata Banerjee refused to share the mood of optimism in the Congress, her ally.        
	When asked today what she thought about the Congresss successful bandh, Mamata curtly replied: Ask those who had called the bandh.         
	She refused to take any other questions on the subject. Instead, she announced the programmes that her party had chalked out for the July 21 martyrs day, when 13 Youth Congress supporters she was leading were killed in police firing in 1993.        
	A Congress meeting presided over by state party president Pranab Mukherjee decided to launch its month-long movement with a sit-in opposite Metro cinema on July 29. On August 9, Congress workers will organise Mangalkot chalo (march) to be followed by a march to Writers on August 26.         
	Nine Congress MLAs led by legislature party leader Manas Bhuniya were chased across paddy fields and stoned by alleged CPM supporters when they went to a village in the Mangalkot area of Burdwan to distribute relief among supporters on Wednesday.         
	Pranab Mukherjee today congratulated the people of Bengal for making the bandh a success and urged the state government to ensure peace in Mangalkot.        
	Both the Congress and Trinamul boycotted what was meant to be an all-party meeting in Burdwan, accusing the district administration of being partisan.         
	Although Trinamul had also boycotted the two earlier all-party meetings on Mangalkot, the Congress had participated. We decided to skip todays meeting as a mark of protest, said Rabindranath Chatterjee, the Congress MLA from Katwa who had to be given eight stitches on the head after Wednesdays attack.

                                                                                                               Teen killed
                            
	Cooch Behar, May 20: A Class XI student was repeatedly poked with spears and killed during a clash between Trinamul Congress and CPM supporters in Cooch Behars Mathabhanga last night.        
	The CPM alleged that Bibek Barman, 18, was murdered without any provocation.         
	The area had been tense since Monday when a Trinamul supporter was hacked to death. Trinamul had called a bandh yesterday to protest the murder. Schools and shops were again shut today, for Bibek.        
	A CPM leader said the teenager had gone to look for his CPM supporter father when he got caught in the clash.         
	Police said seven people had been arrested.

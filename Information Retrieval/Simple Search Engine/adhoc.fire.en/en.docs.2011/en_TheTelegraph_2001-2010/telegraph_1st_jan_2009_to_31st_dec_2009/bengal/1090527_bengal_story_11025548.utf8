The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Sunderbans home hunt
                                                                                                               Sunderbans home hunt
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                          A Bengal tiger                                  
	Calcutta, May 26: Floodwaters in sanctuary, tiger in village.        
	A Sunderbans tiger apparently looking for safe ground after its reserve went under water during yesterdays cyclone ambled into a villagers home.        
	Pintu Mirdha, almost face to face with the beast at his house in Jamespur village of South 24-Parganas Gosaba, raised the alarm.        
	The man and his neighbo-urs called forest officials who tranquillised the animal, said Subrat Mukherjee, the director of the Sunderbans Tiger Reserve.        
	The swirling Bidya had smashed an embankment, flooded the reserve and forced the animal to seek safe ground in Jamespur, about 170km from Calcutta, Mukherjee said.        
	The captured tiger will be released in the core area of the forest after it recovers from the effects of the sedatives.        
	The tiger was not the only one fleeing the floodwaters: Mukherjee said two deer had strayed into Satyanarayanpur village in Bali Island.         
	They were caught and released in the forest later. However, reserve officials found one deer dead in Haldibari.        
	The director of the Sunderbans Biosphere Reserve, N.C. Bahuguna, said work on the captive breeding of the spot- ted deer, many of which were feared washed away, would continue.         
	He declined to put a number on the number of deer that have gone missing from the government-run breeding centres at Jharkhali and Bakkhali but asserted that the project will continue.        
	Boats have been kept on standby after reports that around 20 full-grown crocodiles have escaped from the breeding centre at Bhagabatpur near Sagar Island.         
	It will be almost impossible to locate and capture them as the water level is high even during low tide, a senior forest official said.        
	Another forester said the Bakkhali and Jharkhali deer breeding centres, which have been completely destroyed, would be rebuilt, but the stress now was to protect villagers from the straying animals.

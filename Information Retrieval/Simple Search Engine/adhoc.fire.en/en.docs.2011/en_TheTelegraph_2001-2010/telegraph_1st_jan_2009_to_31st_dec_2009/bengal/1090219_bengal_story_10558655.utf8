                                                                                                               Mother gets life
                            
	Krishnagar, Feb. 18: The Nadia court today sentenced a woman and her brother-in-law to life for killing her husband.        
	Rebati Ghoshs six-year-old son Tanmoy had testified against her and demanded death for his fathers killers.         
	Rebati and Manoj had been held guilty yesterday. Delivering the sentence today, the judge said: They are not being given death as the woman has two small children.        
	Nandakishore Ghosh, 65, whose elder son was murdered by the younger one, said: I feel sad, but I accept the judgment. Yesterday, he had said he wanted Manoj punished.         
	Tanmoy had seen his mother and uncle smother his father last May. The killers thought he was asleep.

                                                                        Wednesday , November 11 , 2009                                                                                                                                                                                              Police sweepers in Maoist clutches
          OUR BUREAU                              
	Nov. 10: Two sweepers of a Lalgarh police camp were abducted by villagers and handed over to Maoists today during a demonstration by the Peoples Committee Against Police Atrocities.        
	Maoist leader Kishanji said tonight that Rajendra Hela and Ramswarup Hela, in their forties and from the Gohomidanga camp, had been arrested by the villagers.         
	They later handed them (the sweepers) over to the members of the Peoples Liberation Guerrilla Army. We have declared them prisoners of war. But we have decided to release Rajendra early tomorrow morning as his relative is in hospital. Both prisoners of war are safe, said Kishanji.        
	The rebel leader said, however, that Ramswarup would be released only after the Bengal government apologised for a police lathicharge this afternoon on tribal demonstrators in Manidaha.         
	The peoples committee rally was organised to protest the murder of Trinamul Congress supporter Khagen Majhi last evening by alleged CPM activists. Nearly 3,000 villagers were demonstrating with the body of Majhi in front of the Manidaha panchayat office around 11.30am.        
	After the sweepers abduction, a large contingent of policemen and RAF jawans was sent from Midnapore town to Manidaha around 3pm. The force resorted to a lathicharge to disperse the protesters and take away the body.        
	Superintendent of police Manoj Verma said the Maoists had abducted the duo. It is the handiwork of the Maoists. They were trying to attack the police camp at Manidaha using villagers as a shield. The police are trying to find the abducted persons.        
	The sweepers were travelling in a Sumo to Midnapore town to serve at the police lines. There was another Sumo, carrying two India Reserve Battalion jawans and an inspector. The vehicles ran into the demonstration at Manidaha. The second Sumo managed to turn around and drive towards Gohomidanga.         
	The sweepers apparently told their driver that they were scared. The driver told us that Rajendra and Ramswarup feared that the mob might set fire to their vehicle. They said they were in plainclothes and would not be recognised as police employees and got off, said a police officer.         
	Kishanji said: Our men will take him (Rajendra) to a bus stop early tomorrow morning. We, too, are human. We will take a decision on the other prisoner of war later.        
	Jawans injured        
	Two CRPF jawans were injured in a gun battle with Maoists in Salboni. A bullet grazed Surajit Dass chest. Sanjib Das was hit in the leg.

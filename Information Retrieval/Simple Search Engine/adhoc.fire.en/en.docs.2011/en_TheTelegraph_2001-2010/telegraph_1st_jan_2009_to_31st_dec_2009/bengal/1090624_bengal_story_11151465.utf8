The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Defang mission for Cobra   Force told to clear path for police
                                                                                                               Defang mission for Cobra     -  Force told to clear path for police
          PRONAB MONDAL                                                  
	Lalgarh, June 23: Cobras with a brief to shoot the enemy at sight are being sent into the forests along the road from Goaltore to Pingboni and Kadashole to clear the way for police.        
	It is from this area that the police were beaten back a few days ago and the main challenge now is to how to push forward with minimum casualties.        
	Since the gunfight on Sunday, many companies of central and state police have arrived at Goaltore but not moved.        
	To crush the resistance, 40 members of the CRPFs Cobra force, which is trained in jungle warfare, will fan out in the forests and neutralise the Maoists.         
	We dont want them to take anyone hostage, an officer said. That will be a drain on their resources. Theyve been instructed to shoot the enemy in the head so they dont have to waste too many bullets.        
	Each Cobra will carry AK-47 rifles with a range of 800 metres, 2,000 rounds of amm-unition, grenades, a foldable sniper rifle with night-vision telescopic range tucked into their backpacks, night-vision binoculars and Swiss knives.         
	As usual, they will not be in uniform but in casual clothes and trainers. Inside the jungles, they will keep in touch with each other over wireless sets, the officer said. We will track their positions from Goaltore via GPS.        
	Although the members of the Cobra unit will keep in touch with each other inside the jungle, they will operate on their own. There will also not be any supply line to fall back on.        
	But in case a Cobra comes across a big group of Maoists, he can call for reinforcements.         
	They are all trained in unarmed combat. They can fall back on that in case they run out of ammunition, an offi- cer said. But 2,000 rounds for one person is a lot of ammo and it should last them two weeks. If they wrap up their job before that, they can come back before.        
	For food, they will carry sattu (ground gram), Threptin biscuits and calcium and vitamin supplements. Each Cobra will set out with some water but will have to fend for themselves once the stock runs out.         
	Intelligence inputs point to a major build-up of armed Maoists, especially at Pingboni and Kadashole.         
	They are determined to prevent the forces from proceeding to Ramgarh and believe they can put up the toughest resistance there, an officer said. That is why we need the Cobras to scour the jungles and flush out the Maoists.        
	The large force of state and central personnel that has as-sembled at Goaltore is meant to join another combined force which has set out from Bank-uras Sarenga and is now camping on the districts border with West Midnapore.        
	One of the main objectives of the Cobra mission is to flush out the guerrillas from the jungles so they are not able to detonate improvised explosive devices. The IEDs planted along the route need to be detonated; they dont explode under pressure, said an officer.         
	Even if the advancing forces step on them, they wont explode.        
	The Maoists today said their strategy was being overseen by Kishanji, the leader of their armed squad who is camping in Lalgarh. He is personally monitoring our operations, a Maoist said. It wont be easy for the police.

  - Gateman who risked life to avert crash suspended        OUR CORRESPONDENT                            The lever that did not work allegedly because of the Raiganj station officials negligence and the Subhasganj gateman who has been suspended. Telegraph pictures                                       
	Raiganj, Sept. 14: A gateman who had put his life on the line to stop a train and avert a level-crossing crash in north Bengal yesterday was handed a suspension letter in hospital hours later for dereliction of duty.         
	A senior official at Raiganj station in North Dinajpur said Uday Chandra Dey had been suspended under orders from higher authorities.        
	Waving a red flag, Dey had run up the tracks towards the speeding Radhikapur-Katihar passenger at 10.30am yester- day after realising that the level crossing gate wasnt coming down because of a snag.        
	The snag was allegedly a result of negligence of officials at Raiganj station who had not activated a lock that would allow Dey to insert a key and bring the gate down.        
	Seconds before the train would have hit him, he jumped off the tracks. The train driver slammed the brakes but the momentum took him a few metres past the level crossing at Subhasganj, about 2.5km from Raiganj station. The train had, however, slowed down by the time it reached the gates and those in its way had the time to move away.        
	The Northeast Frontier Railways Katihar divisional manager, Babulal Gaekwad, said: The primary fact is that the gate was not closed when the train had passed. The gateman was in charge and he has been suspended. But we are looking into the sequence of events and action will be taken after responsibility is fixed.         
	A railway official admitted that the series of technicalities involved from a train lea-ving a station to the gates closing is the shared responsibility of the signalling staff and gatemen.        
	However, Gaekwad wou-ldnt say why no action was being taken against those whose alleged callousness nearly resulted in a tragedy.         
	Around 11am yesterday, Dey was taken to hospital with cuts on his head and a bruised arm.         
	He didnt expect the shocker that a senior railway official brought to him in a brown envelope.        
	Dey today said it was impossible for him to close the gates without the lever of the lock being activated by those in charge of the signalling system at Raiganj station.         
	The 52-year-old gateman, who now draws Rs 11,000 a month, will get only half the pay until being exonerated. He has two school-going children and wife at home.         
	No official would say how long the probe might drag.        
	Station manager Manojit Dutta declined comment.         
	A senior official said Raiganj station had the controls of three level crossings, including Subhasganj. According to standard procedure, the assistant station master rings up the guards kiosks at level crossings before a train leaves the station. Only then is the green light given. After that, the signalling staff unlock the lever in the gate, while the gateman uses a key to bring it down. However, yesterday, the station authorities did not activate the gates lever.        
	Residents and local traders said there had been several occasions when the gates could not be closed. I can remember at least six instances. The gateman had used the siren to alert us. Yesterday, the siren wouldnt have worked because of a power cut, said Ratan Dey, who lives nearby.         
	Electric trains do not run on the section and the railways do not supply the power to the level crossings.         
	Many like Ratan felt Dey was being made a scapegoat.

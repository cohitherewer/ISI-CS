The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Alliance on Cong agenda
                                                                                                               Alliance on Cong agenda
          INDRANIL GHOSH                          Mamata: Wait and watch?                                  
	Calcutta, Feb. 11: A state Congress panel will meet on Saturday to chalk out the best way forward on the possible alliance with Mamata Banerjee without sacrificing the partys interests.        
	A day after sealing a deal on a consensus candidate for the Assembly bypoll to the Bishnupur West seat, the Congress and the Trinamul Congress appeared cautious on scaling it up to a pan-Bengal pact against the Left before the Lok Sabha elections.        
	We have made a substan- tial gesture by pulling out our candidate for the bypoll, said state Congress working president Subrata Mukherjee. The two parties must now think in terms of coming together on honourable terms.         
	After a word from party president Sonia Gandhi, state Congress chief Pranab Mukherjee had asked Subrata from Delhi to announce the withdrawal of the party candidate for the South 24-Parganas seat.        
	So far, things have happened in relation to one Assembly bypoll, said Pradip Bhattacharya, also a party working president. We can move forward if Trinamul realises the importance of our gesture.         
	In a way, pulling lightweight Mumtajuddin Gazi out of the race did not hurt the Congress much. It has spared the party certain humiliation and given it a chance to counter Mamatas likely charge that the Congress was not serious about a united opposition to the CPM.        
	The co-ordination committee will have to figure out on Saturday how far the Congress may have to go to accommodate Mamata and how honourable an alliance with her will be.         
	Everything depends on how seats are shared between the two parties, said Deepa Das Munshi, an MLA from north Bengal, where the Congress has been resisting Trinamul attempts to gain a foothold.         
	It remains to be seen how Mamata responds to the Congresss demand for seats and how she presses her own demands.         
	Mamata was not available for comment. Sources said she held detailed discussions with party colleagues in her house.         
	An aide said she would meet Pranab Mukherjee and Mohsina Kidwai, the AICC secretary in charge of Bengal, after knowing the outcome of the Congress meeting. Although Parliament will be in session from tomorrow, Mamata, Trinamuls lone MP, may reach Delhi only on Monday. She intends to start negotiations with the Congress brass when in Delhi, the aide said.        
	Ally SUCI, a small but aggressive party well entrenched in South 24-Parganas and Purulia, today threatened to snap ties with Trinamul if Mamatas alliance with the Congress stretched beyond Bishnupur.        
	To win Trinamuls hand, the Congress must promise not to court the CPM and its allies after the Lok Sabha elec- tions, said Pravas Ghosh, the SUCI state secretary.         
	Without the SUCI, Mamata has to all but give up hopes of snatching at least two CPM seats in South 24-Parganas.

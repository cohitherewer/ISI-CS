          NARESH JANA                          Indranil Sahoo in front of a bullet-smashed mirror at his home. (Samir Mondal)                                  
	Salboni, Dec. 15: Twenty hours had passed but Indranil Sahoo was still coiled up in bed, refusing to step out of his Pirakata home this afternoon.        
	At least six bullets hit the Sahoos house last evening, one flying past Indranil as the joint forces from Salboni engaged Maoists.        
	Bullets landed on our home from all directions. I dread going out. What will happen to my studies if this goes on? asked the Class VI student of Pirakata High School who had crouched under a bed with father Prabir to duck the bullets. Indranils mother Bulurani, sister Payel and grandfather Satyasadhan found cover under a bed in another room.        
	A West Midnapore officer said there was no way of telling whether the bullets had been fired by the Maoists or the security forces because the rebels often used stolen police guns. Peoples homes cant be the target of the joint forces, he added.        
	The encounter yesterday went on for almost five hours from 5pm. No one was injured in the firing, but the shock scarred the Sahoos.         
	Indranils father Prabir, a cement trader, said: A bullet shattered the glass panes of our window and landed on the clotheshorse. My son started screaming. We remained under the bed for over two hours.        
	His wife Bulurani, too, is traumatised. My husband kept shouting from the other room not to try to close the doors or windows. He told us to lie below the bed, she said.        
	Today, Indranils grandfather protested before the personnel at the Pirakata outpost. Can anyone live like this? Ill lodge a complaint, he said.

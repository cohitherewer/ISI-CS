The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Steel strip off tram tracks pierces taxi
                                                                                                               Steel strip off tram tracks pierces taxi
  - Flukey escape for passenger amp; cabbie        A STAFF REPORTER                                                   
	Calcutta, Jan. 24: A steel strip jutting out of tram tracks near Wellington Square pierced the belly of a taxi, punctured its rear seat and emerged in the boot this morning, missing the driver and the lone passenger by a foot or so.        
	The 13.5ft strip struck the car on the right, just behind the drivers seat. The passenger was on the left.         
	So sharp and swift was the piercing act that driver Khokan Mondal did not even realise what happened.        
	The taxi had got stuck on the piece of metal. Khokan, 32, could not see it and pressed on the accelerator. I didnt see anything on the road and I didnt know how my car could get stuck. It wasnt moving even when I pressed the accelerator hard. But when I stepped out, I was horrified.         
	The tram tracks had gone through his car. I opened the boot. A 2.5ft steel strip was jutting out, Khokan, a resident of Kankulia Road near Golpark, said.        
	Witnesses said the passenger got out of the car, saw what had happened, hailed another taxi and went away.        
	Police said he had hired Khokans taxi at Bowbazar. It was heading towards Park Street along Rafi Ahmed Kidwai Road around 11.45am when it got stuck and the driver heard a muted thud.         
	A crowd that gathered around the car urged Khokan to lodge a complaint, but he said he wanted to got to a temple and offer puja first. Lord Biswakarma has saved me.         
	Local people suggested to Khokan that he should sue Calcutta Tramways Company (CTC) for compensation. But he had not lodged a complaint till late tonight.         
	The police said they could do nothing in the absence of an official complaint.        
	Gas cutters had to be used to extricate the car. Local people and CTC mechanics helped in the job that took an hour.         
	After the car was freed, Khokan drove away. The engine was apparently unscathed.         
	The tram company admitted lapses in the repair of tracks along the stretch, in the heart of the city. We had decided to start the repairs afresh, but the accident happened before we could start work. It is an extremely unfortunate incident and we promise immediate repair, said CTC managing director Pradip Chattopadhyay.         
	An insider said the state of the tracks was the same on several stretches. If it was Rafi Ahmed Kidwai Road today, it could be some other road tomorrow.        
	Wellington residents said todays was the third accident in the past two months. Earlier, a strip had pierced the tyre of a motorbike. The man riding it was hurt. Several complaints to the CTC havent yielded any result, said Sultan Khan, who owns a two-wheeler accessories shop nearby.        
	This was not the citys first brush with the hazard of steel on roads. In 2003, Amit Dalmia, who had returned home after completing his MBA at Leeds University, was killed when a cable laid for the broadband service of a telecom company pierced his car on Camac Street.        
	A group of people blocked Rafi Ahmed Kidwai Road for nearly an hour today.         
	CTC chief engineer Chandra Sekhar Bhattacharya said tracks along 125 metres, from SN Banerjee Road to Wellington, would be repaired immediately.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Why? Girl asks Gurung
                                                                                                               Why? Girl asks Gurung
          AVIJIT SINHA                          Answer, please: Morcha chief Gurung                                  
	Siliguri, Jan. 2: A schoolgirl whose entire family supp-orts the Gorkha Janmukti Morcha called up Bimal Gurung today and asked: Why are you doing this?        
	Prithika Pradhans voice trembled as she spoke to Bimalji, a man she had only seen from far or heard in speeches, but she went on. My house was ransacked, the eatery my mother ran was burnt down in a senseless act of violence that we could not comprehend.        
	Why should the Morcha target innocent people, burn their houses and their dreams, for the criminal acts of a few people?        
	Over 100 Morcha supporters descended from Kurseong yesterday and ransacked homes in Rohini and set many of them ablaze.        
	Prithika lay awake last night, unable to understand the madness, the frenzied screams of the mob as it went around setting fire to the homes, especially because her family supported Gurung and his call for Gorkhaland.        
	This morning, Prithika told The Telegraph: I had to have an answer to the mindless violence indulged in by a party that claims to believe in the ideals of Mahatma Gandhi. They were the people we supported, so I was sure they would provide us with some answers.        
	End of the day, she wasnt sure if she had got the answers. But both Morcha president Gurung and secretary Roshan Giri listened to me patiently.        
	The Class XI student of Kendriya Vidyalaya, Sukna, got the phone numbers of the Morcha Top Two through friends and relatives. She tried Gurungs first, but it was busy. So she dialled Giri.         
	He confirmed receiving the call. I told her I didnt know much about the inci- dent as I was in Delhi (for the tripartite talks), but I assured her that Rohini wont face any problem in the future.         
	Prithika got through to Gurung later. But he was not available for comment.

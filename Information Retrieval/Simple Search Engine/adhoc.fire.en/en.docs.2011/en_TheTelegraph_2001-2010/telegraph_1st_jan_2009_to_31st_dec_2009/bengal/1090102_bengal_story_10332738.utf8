The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Civic wrath on Dooars fests
                                                                                                               Civic wrath on Dooars fests
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Alipurduar, Jan. 1: The Alipurduar Municipality has decided not to provide any civic services to the tea festival beginning tomorrow and Dooars Utsav starting on January 6 at the parade ground here.        
	Dipto Chatterjee, the chairman of the municipality, today said: The tea festival is being organised by the state backward classes welfare department, but nobody from the department invited me to a meeting, nor did they discuss anything with the civic body.         
	State finance minister Asim Dasgupta is likely to inaugurate the three-day-long festival.        
	Although the festival is being held within the municipal area, the civic body will not provide drinking water, clean the heaps of garbage at the venue, set up stalls and not depute any employees for the fest, the chairman said.        
	The municipality will also do the same to Dooars Utsav scheduled to begin at the same venue on Tuesday. Former footballer Chuni Goswami is likely to inaugurate the seven-day-long festival.        
	Chatterjee took exception to the organising committees neglect. The committee, formed by a few selected persons, does not invite anybody from the municipality to attend any of its meetings. Last week, committee general secretary had sought my permission for the festival. I am yet to give the go-ahead, but the pandal has already been erected. The councillor concerned also does not know anything about the festival, he said.         
	The chairman said whenever any programme was organised within the civic area, the municipality must be given due importance. But unfortunately we are neglected by the committee which is frustrating for us. He was not aware of the reason for the neglect, he added.

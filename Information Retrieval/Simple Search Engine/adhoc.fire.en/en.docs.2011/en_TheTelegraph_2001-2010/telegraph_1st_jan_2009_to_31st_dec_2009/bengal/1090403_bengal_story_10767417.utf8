The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Manifesto toes front line 
                                                                                                               Manifesto toes front line 
  - Lalgarh left out; Singur, Nayachar mentioned once        OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                                  
	Calcutta, April 2: The Left Fronts joint manifesto released today has one mention of Singur and Nayachar, and none of Nandigram, Lalgarh or the governments industrial policy.        
	The CPM, when it prepared the draft manifesto, had mentioned Lalgarh, a trouble spot in West Midnapore. But the front partners wanted it omitted as they are not comfortable with the way the CPM has handled the tribal unrest there. They argued that it would be unwise to put a contentious issue in the manifesto.        
	Nayachar, the draft manifesto had said, would fetch an investment of Rs 92,000 crore following the approval of the central government and provide jobs to a lakh people.         
	In the final script, Nayachar, along with Singur, found mention among several projects that the violent Opposition has tried to disrupt.         
	The front partners also made sure that Nayachar was classified as a proposed project  a reminder that the formal nod from the Centre was yet to come.        
	Front leaders said the changes to the draft betrayed the CPMs compulsion to avoid fresh fissures in the alliance before general elections. Also, it was an effort to hide the front big brothers wounds, suffered while trying to acquire land for industry.        
	The joint appeal signed by Jyoti Basu, chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee and other front leaders was released by front chairman Biman Bose.         
	CPM leaders and Bose justified the silence on the land controversy saying this was not a national issue that should get focus in a general election campaign. But privately, some leaders admitted that any effort to justify land acquisition would open a Pandoras box and only help Mamata Banerjees Ma, Mati, Manush plank gain more credibility among rural voters.         
	The CPMs national manifesto as well as the joint appeal by the Left parties in Delhi did mention issues related to land acquisition and special economic zones.         
	Asked about the omission of Nandigram, Bose said: Unlike Singur, the government has declared it will not acquire land in Nandigram and has no industrial project proposed to come up there. Thats why it finds no mention.         
	The appeal referred to the volume of proposed investment in industry but nothing more. Instead, it sought peoples support to ensure comprehensive development and social justice in every sector including agriculture, industry and service sector.

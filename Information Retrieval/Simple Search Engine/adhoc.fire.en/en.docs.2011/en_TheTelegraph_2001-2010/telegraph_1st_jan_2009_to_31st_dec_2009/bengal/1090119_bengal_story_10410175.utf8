The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Mamata unity cry to avert vote split
                                                                                                               Mamata unity cry to avert vote split
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Calcutta, Jan. 18: Mamata Banerjee called for a consolidation of Opposition votes before the Lok Sabha elections, a day after Congress leader Pranab Mukherjees veiled criticism of her anti-land acquisition agitation.         
	Mukherjee, the foreign minister, had told a Bharat Chamber of Commerce gathering that political parties, whether in power or the Opposition, should play a positive role in industrialisation and the countrys development. The Opposition today may become ruling party tomorrow. We should not say anything that should make us eat our own words when we come to power.         
	Keen on a Congress alliance, Mamata today swallowed the criticism and only said her movements in Singur and Nandigram were justified.        
	A wind of change is blowing across Bengal since the panchayat polls (last May) and Opposition votes have to be consolidated at this juncture. If we are able to avert a split in Opposition votes, the CPMs ouster from Bengal is inevitable, the Trinamul Congress chief said.         
	Mukherjees remarks, however, gave the CPM a shot in the arm. Party state secretary Biman Bose said: Pranabbabu has realised the truth and voiced his disapproval of the Oppositions movement against land acquisition.         
	Addressing party workers in her Calcutta South parliamentary constituency, Mamata hastened to add: My call for consolidation of Opposition votes should not be seen as a sign of my weakness.         
	Congress legislature party chief Manas Bhuniya said his party, too, wanted an alliance with Mamata. But some Trinamul leaders who attended the session with their party chief today said she was more desperate.         
	The reason, one of them said, was the fear of losing minority votes. Didi fears an erosion of her minority vote bank (if Opposition votes split) in Kabitirtha, Garden Reach and some Muslim-dominated parts of central Calcutta.         
	Another Trinamul leader said: The Congress might jeopardise our prospects in at least 10 Lok Sabha seats out of the 31 in south Bengal if an alliance is not worked out. We must remember we have hardly any presence in the 11 constituencies of north Bengal.         
	A Congress gesture in Purulia, however, might calm some Trinamul nerves. The district Congress today invited local Trinamul chief K.P. Singh Deo to the opening of its new office building in the town.         
	The Congress said Singh Deo had been invited because he was a former district party president.

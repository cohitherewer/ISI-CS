The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Doctors wife, dad attacked
                                                                                                               Doctors wife, dad attacked
                            
	Durgapur, June 2: A mob enraged by the death of a patient raided the doctors house he- re last night, attacked his wife and punched and pushed to the ground his 82-year-old father who is on a pacemaker.        
	When Dipen Roys wife Shakuntala, a doctor herself, stepped out hearing a commotion outside, some 50 people branded her husband a killer and bayed for his blood.         
	Roy, attached to the Durgapur Steel Plant Hospital, was not at home. Shakuntala said: I knew nothing about what had happened. I told them politely he was not at home and no doctor could kill a patient.        
	Then someone from the mob hurled a flowerpot at her and another shoved her to the floor. Her father-in-law came out and the mob dragged him down a flight of steps to the garden. Anil Roy was slapped, punched and scratched. Shakuntala somehow tore him away, took him inside and bolted the door.         
	When police arrived, the mob fled but landed in the hospitals emergency and drove away the doctors and nurses. The ward and the reception area were ransacked.        
	Purushottam Rao, who had been hospitalised under Roy, died in the ICU last evening. We provided him our best treatment, said Roy.         
	The Roys and the Raos have both lodged police complaints. Raos brothers demanded Roys arrest. We had repeatedly told the doctor we wanted to shift him to a better hospital but he dilly-dallied, they said.         
	Baby death: A seven-month-old girl died in Birbhums Rampurhat after the driver of a government ambulance refused to take her to Burdwan Medical College and Hospital because it was late in the night.

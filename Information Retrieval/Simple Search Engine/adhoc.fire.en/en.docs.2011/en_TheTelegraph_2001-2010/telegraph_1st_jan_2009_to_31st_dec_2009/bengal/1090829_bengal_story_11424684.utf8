                                                                                                               Tech school arrests
                            
	Durgapur, Aug. 28: Ten third-year students of a private engineering college in Burdwans Panagarh have been arrested after a clash on the campus over the accounts of a fest.         
	The students of Aryabhatta College of Engineering and Management, who have been charged with attempt to murder among others, were sent to jail custody by a Durgapur court yesterday.         
	Over 50 third-year students today sat on a hunger strike demanding the release of their classmates. Another group started a fast seeking the expulsion of the arrested 10.        
	The chairman of the college, Pradip Agasti, said the institution wouldnt take sides.         
	A section of the students is demanding legal help from the authorities (for those arrested). But we will not interfere in the matter because we dont support hooliganism on the campus. Six students suffered fractures in the head and hands during the clash.

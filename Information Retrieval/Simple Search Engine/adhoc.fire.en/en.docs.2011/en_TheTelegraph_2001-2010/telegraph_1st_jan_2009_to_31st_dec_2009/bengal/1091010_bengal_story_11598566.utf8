The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Trinamul pays Cong back 
                                                                                                               Trinamul pays Cong back 
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Ranaghat, Oct. 9: Sixteen Congress councillors of the 19-member Ranaghat municipality will join Mamata Banerjees party tomorrow, making it a Trinamul civic body.        
	The Congress councillors have cited their partys decision to take the Lefts support to win the mayors post in Siliguri as the reason behind the switch.        
	The councillors, led by chairman Parthasarathi Chatterjee, today met Trinamul general secretary Mukul Roy at Nizam Palace and requested they be inducted into the party. The Congress councillors wanted to join Trinamul to protest their partys move to take the Lefts support in Siliguri, said Roy. The councillors will meet Mamata tomorrow.         
	Congress sources, however, said the 16 councillors left the party because they resented the state Congress general secretary Shankar Singh taking over as the Nadia district president, replacing Congress MLA Ajoy De. All 16 owe allegiance to De, a party leader from Nadia said.        
	Singh accused Trinamul of breaking the Congress. This was an attempt to weaken the Congress and indirectly strengthen the CPM. Such behaviour from our ally is unwelcome, he said.         
	Chatterjee, the civic chairman, said: We were being called the CPMs B team. But now we want to get rid of the infamous tag. People will now stop calling us the CPMs stooges.

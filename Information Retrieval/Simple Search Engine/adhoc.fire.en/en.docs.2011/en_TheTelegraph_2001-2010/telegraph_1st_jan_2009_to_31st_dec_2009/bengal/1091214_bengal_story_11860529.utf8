The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Bus balm before bandh
                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      Bus balm before bandh
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Darjeeling, Dec. 13: The Gorkha Janmukti Morcha today said it would run buses for tourists during the four-day bandh starting tomorrow but the show of generosity may not have many takers.        
	Since early this morning, tourists made a beeline for vehicles to take them to the plains ahead of the four-day bandh beginning Monday.        
	Most of them paid through their nose as the drivers, most of them Morcha supporters, jacked up rates to cash in on the rush.        
	In order to help the tourists, we have decided to start bus services from Darjeeling, Kalimpong, Kurseong and Mirik during the strike period, Morcha assistant secretary Binay Tamang said.         
	Local people, too, will be allowed to avail of the service.        
	Two buses will leave for Siliguri from Darjeeling, Kalimpong and Kurseong at 8am every day between Monday and Thursday. Another set of six buses will run at 11am. Mirik and Sonada will have one bus each, leaving at 9am.         
	These buses will return from Pintail Village in Siligu-ri at 3pm and 4.30pm, said Tamang.         
	Tourists can hire taxis in case of an emergency but only after obtaining permission from Morcha leaders.         
	Those coming down from Sikkim with emergencies will be allowed to pass through, Tamang added.         
	The Himalayan states only road link to the rest of the country is national highway 31A, which passes through the Darjeeling hills. Every time there is a bandh in Darjeeling, the highway is blocked and Sikkim is one of the worst hit.         
	Tamang said Morcha volunteers would be posted on the road to enforce the bandh. Only those with Morcha permits will allowed to ply.        
	People in the hills stocked up essentials on the eve of the shutdown.         
	A hotel owner, whose guests left the hills to escape the bandh, said they paid Rs 2,500 for a drop to Siliguri. Normally, a taxi charges around Rs 1,000 to Rs 1,200 for the trip.        
	The chief of the Morcha youth wing, Alokkant Mani Thulung, said the outfit had posted youths at Sukna to tell tourists not to pay more than normal fares.

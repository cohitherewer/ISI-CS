          A STAFF REPORTER                          Vishal Mega Mart on BT Road. Telegraph picture                                  
	Calcutta, Jan. 10: A security guard who forgot his gun was shot dead on a busy BT Road this afternoon by robbers eyeing the bag of cash he was carrying.        
	Amar Kanta Das, who worked for a private cash-collection agency, had just stepped out of a garment store, carrying Rs 1.45 lakh that he was to deposit with a bank, when the attackers pounced on him.        
	The 40-year-old was shot twice from close as he resisted. One bullet struck him in the chest, the other ripped a finger off.        
	Earlier, Das had arrived at the store, Vishal Mega Mart, near Khardah in an agency van. He left his double-barrel gun on the front seat and entered the outlet with his colleague Rajesh Rao and driver Joy Bhowmik.        
	All three came out together with the money but Rao and Bhowmik fled when the robbers fired and Das slumped to the ground.        
	Supratim Sarkar, the North 24-Parganas superintendent of police, said: We are trying to find out whether the three robbers are from nearby localities. Ive been told they fled towards Calcutta.        
	Chandra Kanta Gupta, who witnessed the scuffle and the shooting while leaving the shop, said: I saw a young man sitting on a motorcycle and two others roaming in front of the outlet.        
	He added: The two youths pounced on three men who were walking towards a van in front of the shop. One of them took out a revolver.        
	Gupta said Das tried to fight the attackers off. He held on to the bag tight but one of the young men fired at him. The two companions with the victim ran away. The gunman then fired another bullet into his chest and picked up the bag. The two attackers jumped onto the two-wheeler, which sped away towards Khardah station.        
	An officer at Khardah police station said: The double-barrel gun was lying on the front seat of the car. Had Das carried the weapon along with him, the incident could have been averted.        
	The police said the garment store had hired the agency to collect cash and deposit it with a bank in Howrah.        
	They send their employees between 3.30pm and 4pm to collect the cash every day. The three men came as usual this afternoon, said Kishan Lohia, store manager.

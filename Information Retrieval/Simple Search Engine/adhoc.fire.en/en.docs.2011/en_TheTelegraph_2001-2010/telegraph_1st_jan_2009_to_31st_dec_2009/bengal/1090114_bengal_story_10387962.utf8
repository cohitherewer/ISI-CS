                                                                                                               Villagers donate land for hospital
          ALAMGIR HOSSAIN                              
	Domkal, Jan. 13: Farmers of a Murshidabad village have donated three bighas (an acre) and promised to raise money to buy more land for a hospital at a time the government is struggling to arrange plots for new projects.        
	Shaukat Mondal, 45, who owns about nine bighas in Muraripur and was among six villagers who gave their land, said they were determined not to let the project go elsewhere.         
	We held a meeting on Saturday and decided to donate three bighas. We were determined to have the hospital in our village. If we did not donate, the project would have gone to some other village.        
	The site for the new block hospital was finalised in a flash when the residents pledged to pitch in, subdivisional officer Meghnad Dey said. The two bighas more required will be bought with the villagers money. They have already collected around Rs 3 lakh for the building.        
	The nearest hospital now is in Domkal town, 13km away. Once a block hospital, it was upgraded and made a subdivisional hospital in 2005.         
	Muharram Ali, 50, who owns 12 bighas, said: Shaukat and a few others convinced me that I should give half a bigha for a greater good.        
	It was difficult to get the remaining two bighas because the plot had three owners bent on selling it. We will buy their land , said Ahsan Ali, 50, who also donated half a bigha.        
	Local MLA Anisur Rahman and district magistrate Parwez Ahmed Siddiqui went to the village last week and urged residents to contribute for the hospital. The DM donated Rs 10,000 and the SDO Rs 5,000. Rahman promised Rs 5 lakh from his area uplift funds.        
	Retired schoolteacher Harun Rashid gave Rs 5,000, his months pension. The hospital is important to us, he said.

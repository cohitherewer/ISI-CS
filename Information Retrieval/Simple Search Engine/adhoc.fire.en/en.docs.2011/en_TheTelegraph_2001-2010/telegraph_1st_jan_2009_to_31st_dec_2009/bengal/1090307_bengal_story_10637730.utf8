The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Congress draws the line
                                                                                                               Congress draws the line
          BARUN GHOSH                              
	Calcutta, March 6: The Congress leadership still seems to be weighing the partys possible gains in Bengal before taking the final call on an alliance with the Trinamul Congress.        
	The central leaders agree with their state counterparts that the alliance with Mamata Banerjees Trinamul would make sense only if it gives the party more seats than it can get without the alliance.        
	Taking into account the grievances of state Congress leaders about unwinnable seats offered by Mamata, Bengal Congress chief Pranab Mukherjee and the AICC general secretary in charge of Bengal, K. Keshava Rao, today called on Congress president Sonia Gandhi in New Delhi.         
	We have already reached a broad understanding with Mamata. Our friendship remains and the alliance will go ahead. We had some differences over one or two seats but that will be sorted out shortly. We shall jointly announce the names of our candidates within the next 48 hours, Rao said after the meeting.        
	Although state Congress leaders are keen to see the alliance go to the final stage in the hope of securing seats for themselves, central leaders are looking at the larger picture and keeping post-poll possibilities in mind.        
	We want the alliance with Mamata to take shape since only this can oust the CPM from Bengal. But at the same time, Mamata should reconsider if she should give us some winnable seats, said PCC working president Subrata Mukherjee after returning from Delhi. Mukherjee, an alliance advocate, is eyeing the Jadavpur Lok Sabha seat.        
	This means Mamata has to find a way to give the Congress more winnable seats than she has agreed to so far.        
	Mamata said she would wait. The Congress told me that it would let me know within 48 hours when Pranabda came last Sunday. But I have not yet heard anything from them. I could have announced the candidates names but I cannot do that because I have given my word. I have to bear this for the sake of the alliance, she said. When the CPM has already begun campaigning, I am left with no option but to wait for the Congress.... Courtesy demands that I should wait.         
	The argument in the Congress to keep Mamata waiting goes like this. The partys earlier anxiety about Mamata going with the BJP in future is no longer valid.        
	Her experience of aligning with the BJP have clearly shown that she can no longer risk this in Bengal, where Muslims constitute nearly 27 per cent of the votes. She has to either forge an alliance with the Congress or go it alone.        
	The Congresss position on the alliance, party sources argued, has also to take into account the possible scenario for the 2011 Assembly polls in Bengal. A bad bargain now can seriously weaken the Congresss position two years later.        
	Also, compared to 2001, when the Congress had an alliance with Trinamul for the Assembly polls, the Congresss position is now much stronger in national politics.        
	Finally, there is the question of another possible Congress-Left relationship after Lok Sabha polls.        
	Rao had a surprise visitor, too. Bimal Gurung of the Gorkhaland Janmukti Morcha called on him to explore possibilities of a broad alliance against the Left.        
	The talks are said to have made little headway as the Congress is averse to a second partition of Bengal and prefers more autonomy. But Rao said he was hopeful of a favourable response from Gurung.        
	Somen, Sudip axe         
	Assembly Speaker Hashim Abdul Halim has terminated the membership of Somen Mitra and Sudip Bandopadhyay under the anti-defection law.         
	A few hours later, Mamata announced that Mitra and Bandopadhyay would fight on Trinamul tickets in the Lok Sabha polls.         
	Mitra, sources said, would be fielded from Diamond Harbour and Bandopadhyay from Calcutta North. But there has been no official word on this.

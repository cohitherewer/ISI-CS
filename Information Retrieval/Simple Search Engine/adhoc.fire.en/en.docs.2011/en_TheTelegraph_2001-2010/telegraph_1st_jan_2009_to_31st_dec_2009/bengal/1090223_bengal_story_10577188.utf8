          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Malda, Feb. 22: Two Malda police officers have been suspended for trying to hush up a schoolgirls rape, allegedly by a CPM gram panchayat member.        
	Dilip Mahanto, the officer in charge of an outpost un- der Ratua police station, and Dilip Roy, an assistant sub-inspector, had arranged a shalishi (reconciliation) meeting to settle the case and allegedly demanded a cut from the fine handed to the accused.        
	Malda police chief Satyajit Banerjee said an internal probe had found them guilty of trying to hush up the case.         
	On February 18, Sanaul- lah Sheikh allegedly raped the Class VII student.         
	When her father went to the Pukhuria outpost, Mah-anto suggested that he take some money and settle the matter. A meeting held on the outposts terrace allegedly fined Sanaullah Rs 40,000. I would have got Rs 30,000 and the rest would have gone to the police, the father said.

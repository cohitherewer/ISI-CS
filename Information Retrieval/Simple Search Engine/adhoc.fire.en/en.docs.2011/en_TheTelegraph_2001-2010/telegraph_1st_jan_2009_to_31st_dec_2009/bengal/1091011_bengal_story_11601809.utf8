The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Mamata for Maoist talks
                                                                                                               Mamata for Maoist talks
            OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Mamata                                  
	Calcutta, Oct. 10: Mamata Banerjee today said the Centre should initiate talks with Maoists and eminent people could be asked to start the process.        
	The railway ministers push for talks has come at a time the UPA government, of which her Trinamul Congress is a constituent, is planning a crackdown on the Maoists across several states.        
	We do not believe in the politics of bloodshed and violence. These daily killings should stop. There are many prominent people among the Maoists who have brains. I would like the central government to begin a dialogue with the Maoists. The Maoists should shun violence and sit for dialogue. If possible, I think intellectuals and eminent people can be asked to start such a dialogue, she said in an interview to STAR Ananda.         
	All this (the talks) should be done publicly and there shouldnt be any hide-and-seek. I will definitely tell Chidambaramji to start such talks. Not all Maoists or Naxalites are bad.        
	P. Chidambaram, the Union home minister, has said the door for talks was open but the Maoists will have to lay down arms first.        
	Mamata said discussions with the Maoists may be the only way to stop them from killing people. What we are watching is a Maoist agitation in Lalgarh and its adjoining areas on the issue of development. Our party had begun the movement (for the tribals) first. I have seen tribals here survive by eating ants as they dont get food for days. But killing innocents cannot be the solution. The Maoists will have to be convinced that their path is not right, she said.        
	For this, dialogue is necessary. If talks can be held with the Ulfa in Assam or with (separatist) leaders of Jammu and Kashmir, whats wrong with having discussions with the Maoists? she asked.        
	Automobile hub        
	Mamata said tonight the railways would set up an automobile hub in Howrah on 300 acres of railway land. The hub will be built on a public private partnership basis. But I dont want to disclose other details of this project as an expert committee is looking into it, she said.         
	In Delhi, railway sources said they were not aware of an auto hub but plans were afoot to build a facility where a large number of automobiles in rail transit can be stored for distribution to various outlets in the Northeast and Bangladesh. The sources did not know if Mamata was speaking of the same facility or another hub.

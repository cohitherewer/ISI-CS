          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Durgapur, April 21: A school headmaster was beaten up outside a cinema because he had protested when a young man pinched his daughter and pulled her hair during a show.        
	Shankhanath Mukherjee, his wife and daughter, a Class IX girl, went to see the Bengali film Challenge in Durgapur Cinema at City Centre on Sunday.         
	A little after the interval, the man behind started misbehaving. Mukherjees wife said: He pulled my daughters plaits, pinched her and made lewd comments at us. When my husband protested, he threatened him with dire consequences. At this, some others in the audience protested and the man stopped arguing.         
	The man, identified by police as Pintu Banerjee, called up four of his friends over the phone and all of them pounced on Mukherjee as he stepped out.         
	The youths kicked Mukherjee, 40, repeatedly. When his wife and 15-year-old daughter rushed to his rescue, the attackers slapped them.        
	Mukherjee, the headmaster of Netajinagar High School, rolled down the stairs outside the theatre and lay unconscious with a bleeding forehead. The youths snatched his wallet, a gold ring and cellphone before scooting.        
	Mukherjees wife said that while all this was going on, no one leaving the theatre or in the many shops in the crowded area came to their rescue. At least 100 people were in the hall and the market complex on the ground floor. The incident occurred in front of their eyes but no one came forward to help, she said today.         
	Some people from a CPM procession that was passing by took the headmaster to a nearby nursing home around 9.45pm. He got seven stitches on his forehead.         
	His wife lodged an FIR last evening, after her husband was released from the nursing home. I could name two of the attackers as they were calling out each other by name before attacking my husband, she said.        
	The police picked up Sukhen Das, a contractor, and Kanchan Banerjee, a maintenance worker of a mobile service provider, from their homes at Palashdiha, near City Centre, last night.         
	We are looking for three others, including the main accused, Pintu Banerjee, also a resident of Palashdiha, in the heart of the town, said additional superintendent of police Utpal Naskar.        
	Pintu is a sales executive working for the same firm that employs Kanchan.

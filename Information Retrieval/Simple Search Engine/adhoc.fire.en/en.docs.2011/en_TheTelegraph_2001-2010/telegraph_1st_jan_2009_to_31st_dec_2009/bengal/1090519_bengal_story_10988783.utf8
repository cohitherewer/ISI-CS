	Calcutta, May 18: Mamata Banerjee today made a Muslim and a Scheduled Caste MP deputy leaders of the Trina- mul Congress parliamentary party, indicating they could be her ministerial candidates.         
	Sultan Ahmed and Gobinda Naskar were unanimously elected deputy leaders, the Trinamul chief said after the first meeting of her 19 newly elected MPs. Mamata will be the leader of the parliamentary party.         
	At the meeting, Mamata was quoted as telling the MPs that Ahmed and Naskar had to be given a pride of place in the outfit to honour the minorities and SC/ST people whose overwhelming support helped us win 20 Lok Sabha seats (19 Trinamul, one SUCI).        
	Keeping an eye on the 2011 Assembly elections, Mamata is also learnt to have said that proper respect given to the two MPs would send a good message to the minorities and the SC/ST people across Bengal.         
	Trinamul and the SUCI have won four of the five SC seats they contested  Bongaon, Mathurapur, Ranaghat and Joynagar.                     
	While Ahmed won from Uluberia in Howrah, defeating CPM veteran Hannan Mollah, Gobinda Naskar won from Bongaon, trouncing the CPMs Asim Bala.A vast section of minorities in Howrah, Hooghly, Nadia, South and North 24-Parganas rejected the ruling CPM and voted for us, said Trinamul state president Subrata Bakshi.         
	Mamata has apparently requested the Congress leadership for five ministerial berths, including a cabinet post. Both Ahmed and Naskar are going to be inducted as ministers of state in the Union cabinet, said a party general secretary.        
	The Trinamul chief said she would leave for Delhi on Wednesday morning with her MPs to attend a meeting of the UPA partners on ministry formation.         
	Trinamul-backed SUCI MP Tarun Mondal and Trinamul Rajya Sabha members Mukul Roy and Swapan Sadhan Bose attended todays meeting at Mamatas house, which lasted about an hour from 4pm.        
	Mamata said Roy would meet President Pratibha Patil tomorrow with a letter pledging the support of her MPs to the Congress-led government.        
	Asked if the SUCI member was also a signatory, Mamata said: He belongs to the Trinamul group of MPs, but he did not sign the letter of support because of their ideological differences with the Congress. We are in talks with the SUCI to resolve the matter.        
	The party will organise a rally on July 21, which Trinamul marks as Martyrs Day, to dedicate the electoral triumph to Maa-mati-manush.         
	The Congress MP from Malda North, Mausam Noor, called on Mamata during the day.

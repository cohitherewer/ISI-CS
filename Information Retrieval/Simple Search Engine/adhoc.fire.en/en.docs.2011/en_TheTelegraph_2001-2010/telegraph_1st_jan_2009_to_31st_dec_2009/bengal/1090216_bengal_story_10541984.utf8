	Darjeeling, Feb. 15: The office of a Gorkha outfit opposed to the Gorkha Janmukti Morcha was attacked in the heart of Darjeeling town tonight and its leaders cars were torched in a simultaneous raid a few kilometres away.        
	Akhil Bharatiya Gorkha League (ABGL) president Madan Tamang was not in town but his mini truck, Land Rover and Maruti Esteem were parked in the garage.         
	Police said one of the vehicles was burnt and another partially damaged.         
	ABGL leader Mohan Sharma said all three were completely burnt. Madan Tamang is in Nepal and the caretaker, Bikram Rai, alerted me about the attack, Sharma said in Siliguri. We suspect it was a Morcha handiwork.        
	The garage is on the outskirts of Darjeeling town, about 400 metres from Tamangs house at Jorebunglow.         
	On Friday, Tamang had said the Morcha should review its agitation in the Dooars and the Terai because it was heading nowhere.        
	A gang of 15 broke into the party office on Ladenla Road around 7.30pm. They tore off ABGL posters from the walls, pulled out documents and set them afire along with chairs and tables.        
	Darjeeling superintendent of police Rahul Srivastava said the attacks were simultaneous. We have started two cases, one at Darjeeling Sadar police station and the other at Jorebunglow.         
	The ransacking of the Ladenla Road office is the second this year. It was also attacked on January 1 after a Morcha leader who had forced his way into a government guesthouse with his supporters was beaten to death in Rohini, near Siliguri.        
	Morcha general secretary Roshan Giri denied his partys involvement in todays incident. We have no time and interest in going after Madan Tamang, he said.        
	A Morcha shutdown of government offices is being partially lifted in the hills from tomorrow. The ones that collect revenue, like the power and telephone bill collection centres and transport offices, are still going to be shut.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | CM stays firm, Morcha calls strike
                                                                                                               CM stays firm, Morcha calls strike
          OUR BUREAU                              Bhattacharjee (top), Gurung on Wednesday. (Amit Datta)				                                 
	Feb. 4: Chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee today refused to allow the Gorkha Janmukti Morcha to hold rallies in the restive Dooars, prompting the hill outfit to claim that it walked out of a meeting at Writers Buildings and call a 24-hour general strike in the region on Saturday.        
	The call for the strike, which will cover the Darjeeling hills, the Dooars and the Terai, including Siliguri, was given after the chief minister stuck to his stand at the meeting with Morcha president Bimal Gurung today.        
	The chief minister was adamant and denied us permission to hold the public meetings in the Dooars and the Terai areas. When the chief minister refused permission, we staged a walkout. Our indefinite hunger-strike at Gorubathan will also continue, Gurung said.         
	Gorubathan, 70km from Kalimpong, is the place where the Morcha had started an aborted march to the Dooars.        
	The government is not allowing a Morcha rally fearing a local backlash as not everyone in the Dooars wants to be part of Gorkhaland, the Morchas avowed goal, and the area also has a considerable CPM presence  another potential flashpoint.        
	Chief secretary Asok Mohan Chakrabarti said: The chief minister told the delegation that normality had not been restored yet, various ethnic groups are in the region and it would not be proper to hold rallies as it would lead to the escalation of tension.         
	The strike has been called also to protest against the atrocities towards the Adivasis in Lalgarh, another Morcha leader said. The decision to tap Lalgarh is being seen as an attempt to gain the support of the tribals in the Dooars.         
	Gurung, clad in traditional dress, briefed the media in Calcutta in Nepali. However, Hindi was the medium of conversation with Bhattacharjee. I wanted to tell Bengal that our languages are different and so are our dresses. It is because we are different from each other we want separation, said Gurung.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Trinamul arrest for rebel links
                                                                                                               Trinamul arrest for rebel links
                            
	Midnapore, July 8: A Trinamul Congress leader said to be in hiding in West Midnapores Jhargram was arrested today for alleged links with Maoists.        
	Kartick Debsingha was picked up from his brother-in-laws house some 25km from his own village in Salboni.        
	Kartick is the president of a party panchayat unit. Brother-in-law Chittaranjan Mahato, a block Congress president, has also been held, for sheltering him.        
	District police chief Manoj Verma said Kartick had led the Maoists who torched the homes of two CPM leaders last December, was involved in the lynching of a CPM trio this March, and spearheaded the social boycott of the police that compelled the force to abandon a camp in Maoist hotbed Kalaimuri. We have charged him with murder, waging war against the state and obstructing government servants from carrying out their duty.         
	District Trinamul president Mrigen Maity said Kartick was a popular leader. In Calcutta, state party chief Subrata Bakshi accused the government of targeting Trinamul men and branding them Maoists.

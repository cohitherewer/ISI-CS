The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Cong grouse against ally 
                                                                                                               Cong grouse against ally 
          BARUN GHOSH                          Subrata                                  
	Calcutta, Aug. 20: The state Congress has written to the high command requesting its intervention after being harassed and humiliated by the Trinamul Congress during the formation of civic boards.        
	I have written to both Pranabda (state Congress chief Pranab Mukherjee) and Keshavaji (Bengal in-charge K. Keshava Rao) about the harassment of our party workers at the hands of Trinamul activists. Things have to be set right following an immediate discussion, otherwise it is bound to take its toll on the alliance, state party working president Subrata Mukherjee said.        
	The state unit has asked the high command to bring the party out of Trinamul chief Mamata Banerjees shadow.        
	Of the 16 civic elections in June, the Trinamul-Congress Opposition alliance won 13  Trinamul 10, Congress 3.         
	AICC sources said Pranab, who is scheduled to share the dais with Mamata at the inauguration of the Tollygunge-Garia Metro rail extension on Saturday, would convey the party workers grievances to her.         
	A one-to-one with Mamataji is likely when Pranabda is in Calcutta, an AICC leader said from Delhi.         
	Subrata, who had to rush to Udaynarayanpur in Howrah this afternoon after a party office was set ablaze allegedly by Trinamul activists, said: Our workers are being regularly attacked by Trinamul activists in one place or another.        
	The state Congress has alleged that Trinamul did not share power with its ally while forming the civic boards in South Dum Dum and Madhyamgram in the North-24 Parganas and Rajpur-Sonarpur in South-24 Parganas. Trinamul had won in all these places.         
	Asked about the matter, Trinamul state president Subrata Bakshi rubbished the allegation. Our workers had to raise their voice when the Congress took the CPM and the BJPs help to form the board in Uluberia, he said.        
	A state Congress functionary, however, said: Almost all district presidents at last weeks meeting sought protection after attacks on them by Trinamul activists.

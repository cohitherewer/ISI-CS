	Kakdwip, Sept. 25: Nine labourers returning home for Durga Puja died today when their overloaded van turned turtle at Kakdwip after a tyre burst and immediately after, a truck hit it from behind.

I cant remember what happened after that as I lost consciousness, said 18-year-old Bikash Jana from his bed in the Calcutta National Medical College and Hospital.

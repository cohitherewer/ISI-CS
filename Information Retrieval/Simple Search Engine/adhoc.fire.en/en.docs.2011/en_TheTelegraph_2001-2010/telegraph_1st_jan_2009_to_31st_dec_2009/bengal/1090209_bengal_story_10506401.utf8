The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | CM guns for Mamata
                                                                                                               CM guns for Mamata
  - Front poll campaign starts with cry for industry, jobs        OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Bhattacharjee at the rally. Picture by Amit Datta                                        
	Calcutta, Feb. 8: Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee today kick-started the Left Fronts Lok Sabha election campaign, expecting the Centre to greenlight the Nayachar chemical hub before the polls and making it clear that it would help strengthen its pro-industry plank against Mamata Banerjee.        
	At a front rally on the Maidan this afternoon, the chief minister blasted the Trinamul Congress chief for opposing the hub, though it had been shifted from Nandigram to Nayachar. Now they are showing concern for the environment, as if we are going to turn Nayachar into another Hiroshima and Nagasaki.         
	This is a Centre-state joint project. Are the central government, its experts and the states experts stupid?         
	The importance of Nayachar for the government and the CPM to offset the setbacks in Singur and Nandigram was underlined by the initiative to get Jyoti Basus endorsement.         
	State CPM secretary Biman Bose read out Basus message as the ailing party patriarch could not attend the show. The project will generate jobs for lakhs of youths in the state. But the Opposition is likely to oppose the project. I think they will obstruct whatever is good and beneficial for the state and its people, he said.         
	Even if the central nod does not come before the polls, the CPM knows well Nayachar will not witness a popular backlash like Nandigram as the project does not involve land acquisition. Let Mamata oppose Nayachar. It will only expose her real intentions in Nandigram, local MP Lakshman Seth said on the sidelines.         
	The chief minister rejected Mamatas demand to return the land acquired in Singur for the Nano project. The land was not acquired for return and it wont be given back. The unemployed youths of Singur are urging us to get the Tatas back. Industries would come up on the land as we cant betray the people of Singur, he said without elaborating whether the Tatas will be wooed again after the polls.         
	Bhattacharjee asserted that the government would also go ahead with the power plant in Katwa.        
	Besides branding Mamata anti-industrialisation, the front campaign will accuse her of conniving with those who want to split Bengal.         
	The Lalgarh and Gorkhaland agitators are supporting each other. Trinamul stands in between. So the crisis is deep said Bhattacharjee.        
	Bose told supporters: You have to tell people across the state that the principal Opposition party is the main backer of all secessionist forces, in north and south Bengal.         
	With the Congress going slow on a pact with Mamata, Bhattacharjee and Bose restricted their criticism of the UPA government to economic and foreign policies. The usual attack on a grand alliance of the Congress, Trinamul and the BJP was missing.        
	The CPM made every effort to showcase front unity, even allowing the smaller partners to speak before the chief minister. The Forward Blocs Ashok Ghosh and the CPIs Manju Mazumder harped on unity. The allies, who had criticised the government over Nandigram and Singur, trained their guns on Mamata for her politics of anarchy.         
	Bhattacharjee said: We had failed to unite ourselves for the panchayat polls. People taught us a lesson for that mistake.

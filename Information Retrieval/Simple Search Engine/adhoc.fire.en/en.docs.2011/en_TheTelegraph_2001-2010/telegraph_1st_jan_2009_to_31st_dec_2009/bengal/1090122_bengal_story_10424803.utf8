          OUR CORRESPONDENT                          Mukherjee outside Durgapur police station. (Rana Ghosh)                                   
	Durgapur, Jan. 21: A Durgapur businessman abducted on December 30 returned home groggy today after his family paid a ransom.        
	Relatives said the kidnappers put Santanu Mukherjee on the Howrah-bound Kalka Mail last night, possibly at a station in Jharkhand. They waited for him at Durgapur station this morning.        
	Santanus maternal uncle, Babu Kesh, admitted paying the ransom but declined to divulge the amount. He also wouldnt utter a word on how the money was transferred. We had to pay a ransom for his release. We have told police whatever they wanted to know.         
	The kidnappers had asked for Rs 1.5 crore for the release of Mukherjee, 35, a fish wholesaler and iron ore dealer who also has several dumpers.        
	The cash, the family said, was handed over somewhere in Jharkhand.        
	The police questioned Mukherjee for over two hours at Durgapur police station.         
	He said two men dressed in police uniform had stopped his Honda City near an amusement park on the night of December 30. He was driving home around 11pm after a party in a pub. They accused me of drink driving and asked me to talk to their officer, sitting in a (Mahindra) Bolero. When I got out of my car and walked to the jeep with a police sticker on it, the two men pushed me inside at gunpoint. They drove the car fast towards Asansol and forced me to take some tablets. I lost consciousness, he told the police.         
	His new white Honda City was found near Bokaro railway station three days later.         
	After regaining consciousness, Mukherjee found himself in a small room without windows. They gave me two meals a day and kept me blindfolded except while I was eating. Those who guarded me spoke in Hindi, Mukherjee said.

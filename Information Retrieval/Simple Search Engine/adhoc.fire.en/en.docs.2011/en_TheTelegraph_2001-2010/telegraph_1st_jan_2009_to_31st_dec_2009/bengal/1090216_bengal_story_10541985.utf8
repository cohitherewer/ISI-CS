          OUR CORRESPONDENT                      On the brink: Sariful Sheikh at home. Picture by Surajit Roy                                  
	Malda, Feb. 15: A 24-year-old former day labourer has written to chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee asking for permission to end his life, four years after he fell from a 40-metre-high power tower.        
	The fall, while Sariful Sheikh was working in Bihars Muzaffarpur, left him with a broken pelvis and legs, and confined him to bed.         
	I had taken him to Delhi for treatment but ran out of money. He was also admitted to the Malda district hospital for four months where doctors told us nothing more could be done. The contractor he was working for did not pay a farthing, said Sarifuls father Rakimuddin Sheikh.         
	The Malda man is now being treated by ayurvedic practitioners and the panchayat or the local health officials have shown no interest in his predicament. It is better that my son dies. He is suffering great pain and there are sores on his body, said mother Zulekha Bibi.        
	Rakimuddin is a day labourer with four sons and three daughters. My two other sons, Masidur and Jamirul, are working in other states, he said.        
	The chief of the Englishbazar panchayat samiti, the CPMs Akram Hossain, said he was not aware of Sarifuls suffering.         
	There is hardly anything the panchayat can do, but I will write to the block medical officer of health, he said.        
	The Malda chief medical officer of health, Srikanta Roy, said if Sariful was brought to the district hospital he could be treated. We are here to treat the poor. We have to see the patient first and decide the course of action.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | State says Singur land industrial
                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      State says Singur land industrial
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Calcutta, Dec. 11: Chief secretary Asok Mohan Chakrabarti today sent his reply to the railways letter in response to the state governments proposal to set up a coach factory on the plot acquired in Singur for the Tata Motors project and stressed that it had been converted into industrial land.        
	This implies that the land cannot be handed back to farmers and used for cultivation.        
	In its response to the states proposal, the Railway Board had said that it was willing to set up the factory provided 400 acres were returned to unwilling farmers.         
	Railway minister Mamata Banerjee had made the offer first, suggesting that the unit may be a joint venture with the state, but she also said that while the factory could come up on 600 acres, 400 would have to be returned to those who had not collected their compensation cheques.        
	According to sources, in todays letter, there is no mention of the disputed 400 acres.        
	Instead, Chakrabarti has invited the railways to send a team to inspect the land. I have told the Railway Board to come to Singur and see the land on which they want to build the coach factory, he told The Telegraph. Ive also requested them to send details of the their proposal to us.         
	Chakrabarti wrote that he appreciated the prompt response to the states proposal in which the board said the railways would in principle like to set up the factory in Singur. I also mentioned my appreciation of the boards move to take interest in setting up the factory in Singur, he added.        
	Expressing the governments willingness to hand over all 997.11 acres for the coach factory, the letter explained that the land had been legally acquired by the West Bengal Industrial Development Corporation, mutated and converted into industrial land.        
	Late this evening, Trinamul Congress leader Partha Chatterjee said the state governments contention that the character of the Singur land had been converted was a ruse.         
	When it signed a deal with Mamata Banerjee in the presence of the governor (in an attempt to end the agitation against the Tata project), the state government had said it could return 70 acres, Chatterjee said. If it was industrial land that could not be used for farming, how did the government make this promise?         
	He also said that in the first letter from the state, the government had written that if the railways agreed to build the plant, it would ask the WBIDC to initiate the process to resume the land from the Tatas. In todays letter, Chatterjee claimed, the government has said the land is with the WBIDC.

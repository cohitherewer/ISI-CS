          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Malda, Aug. 30: A youth suspected of raping a teenager last night with five other men was allegedly lynched in Malda today.        
	When 25-year-old Manoj Mondal was lynched was not clear as Baghbari, the area where the girl was raped, was rocked by protests since morning.        
	Police said they were informed that Manojs body was lying in a field in Baghbari, about 3km from Malda town.        
	When a police team reached the spot, not a single villager was around. The injury marks on the youths body pointed to lynching, said Satyajit Banerjee, the superintendent of police, Malda.        
	Manoj was an anti-social element in the area and was believed to have raped the girl, Banerjee said.        
	Last night, when the 18-year-old girl was returning home to Baghbari after attending a wedding with her brother-in-law, six men stopped them on a state highway.         
	They hit the brother-in-law on the head and dragged away the girl, the daughter of a vegetable trader, to a sawmill around 500m from the spot and gangraped her, the police said.         
	A group of labourers found the bleeding brother-in-law.        
	This morning, the state highway was blocked for seven hours at Baghbari More by hundreds of villagers protesting against the polices inability to arrest the rapists.        
	The police, though, claimed that three of the six men  all between 20 and 30 years of age and with criminal record had been arrested.         
	The highway blockade started at 6am and was withdrawn at 1pm after Prakash Pal, the subdivisional officer, headquarters, promised that all the rapists would be caught in 48 hours.        
	The sister of the victim alleged that Englishbazar police were informed immediately after the incident by the villagers. But they came more than an hour late, though the police station is just 3km away.         
	The girl was found unconscious and was taken by the police to the district hospital.         
	The protesters today complained to the subdivisional officer and the police that Baghbari had become a den of anti-social elements and women were scared to come out.

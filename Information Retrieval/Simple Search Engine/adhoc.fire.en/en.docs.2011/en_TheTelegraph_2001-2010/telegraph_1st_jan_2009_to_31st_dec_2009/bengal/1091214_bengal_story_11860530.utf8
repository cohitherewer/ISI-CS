	Cooch Behar: An umbrella body comprising several outfits demanding a separate Greater Cooch Behar/Kamtapur has called a bandh in Bengal and Assam on Wednesday.        
	The Separate State Demand Committee, which consists of nine outfits from north Bengal and Assam, wants all six north Bengal districts and 16 from the neighbouring state to be part of Kamtapur. Its supporters have started an indefinite fast in Cooch Behar.

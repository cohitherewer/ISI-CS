The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | From dismay to delight or death   Flight from floodwaters
                                                                                                               From dismay to delight or death 
  Flight from floodwaters          KINSUK BASU                        A mother and her child trek to a relief camp in South   24-Parganas rsquo; Gopalgunj. Picture by Bishwarup Dutta                                      
	Kultali (South 24-Parganas), May 26: At first, Bhaktaram Naskar decided to stay on at home, though the floodwaters was rising.        
	When the 30-year-old farmer saw his cow being dragged away by a torrent in fading daylight, he was shaken.         
	Moments later, the mud wall of his kitchen, across the courtyard, came down and he knew he had to do something, and fast.         
	Bhaktaram asked his brother Gopal where the nearest relief camp was. His heart sank when he heard it was some 16km away.        
	Then he looked at his four-year-old son and his wife and knew his task was cut out.        
	Around five last evening, the resident of Dhorabagda village in South 24-Parganas Kultali perched his son on his shoulder, asked his wife to hold on to him, instructed his brother to carry some rice and started wading through waist-deep water.        
	After over an hour, he realised the water level had inched up his waist. The camp was still too far and the fading light wasnt helping matters.        
	Then it struck him that the panchayat office wont be too far away. A few minutes more and they could see the building  their beacon of hope.        
	Another 20 minutes later the four were at its door, but it was locked.         
	Dismay turned into joy when he faintly heard voices and realised there were people in-side. The Naskars yelled for help and banged on the collapsible gate, pleading for someone to come and open it.         
	A few minutes later  which seemed like a year  a figure appeared.        
	We collapsed in relief, Bhaktaram said today. Now, this office has turned into a sort of an unofficial relief camp. We have some supplies here, other villagers have also pooled in with whatever they managed to salvage from home and we at least have muri and gur to eat.        
	The dismay-to-delight story did not play out for everyone, though.         
	In another makeshift shelter created by villagers at Dighirpaar, 30-year-old Molina Sardar was struggling to come to terms with what she saw last evening: a woman floating away in the water, clutching her grandson.         
	That there was nothing to feed her two sons would have been a lesser concern had they not started wailing.        
	We were given some muri and gur last night but have not had anything to eat this morning, Molina said.         
	I dont know what to do with my two sons.        
	Like Bhaktaram and Molina, hundreds of others were in such makeshift shelters, far from official assistance or politicians attention.        
	When her sons fall silent, Molina will start worrying about the home that she left behind. I want to return home, she said.

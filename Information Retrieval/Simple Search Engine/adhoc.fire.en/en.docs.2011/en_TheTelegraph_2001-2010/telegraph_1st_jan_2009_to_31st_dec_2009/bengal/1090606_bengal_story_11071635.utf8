The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Laid bare by Aila: Lefts panchayat showpiece
                                                                                                               Laid bare by Aila: Lefts panchayat showpiece
          IMRAN AHMED SIDDIQUI                              
	Gosaba, June 5: The strong winds of Aila have swept away one of the biggest claims of the Left Front government in its 32-year regime  empowerment of panchayats.         
	The government wants the Centre to declare Aila a national calamity. But for years, it has failed to fill around 50 per cent vacancies in the Gosaba block office, the nodal centre for relief and development in one of the most backward regions in Bengal and the worst hit by the cyclone.         
	These posts are vacant for several years, said Amiya Bhushan Chakraborty, the block development officer, sitting in his first-floor chamber in the two-storey office building.         
	According to him, out of the 53 sanctioned posts in the block office, 27  including key positions like joint BDO, relief engineer, industrial officer, livelihood development officer and mid-day meal officer  are vacant.         
	However, for the 26 employees in the block office, there are eight peons.         
	The block also has a sanctioned strength of 112 employees for the 14 panchayats un- der its purview, but only 60 of these posts have personnel.        
	Work does get affected and more so in such crisis situations, Chakraborty added while leaving for a meeting with an army team camping here to help the marooned.         
	Lack of manpower is just the tip of the iceberg of the administrative crisis staring on the face of the Sunderbans. A scrutiny of the development and relief operations in Gosaba, which has over 2.5 lakh people, revealed several shortcomings of the three-tier panchayat system.         
	A senior block official told The Telegraph they could not send an Aila alert to the 14 gram panchayats  Gosaba, Rangabelia, Lahiripur, Kochukhali, Biprodaspur, Pathankhali, Chotomullakhali, Sambhunagar, Kumirmari, Satjelia, Bali I and II, Amtali and Radhanagar-Taranagar  because we dont have a communication system in place.         
	With the telecom revolution yet to reach the islands of the Sunderbans, the only mode of communication is radio transmitters (RT), fitted in the panchayat offices.         
	But the RT sets at the panchayats were damaged around two-and-a-half years ago, said the official, adding that the cost of overhauling the system had been preventing repairs.         
	Not just telecommunication, even physical connectivity is a big problem in Gosaba, where the waterways provide the only access but the block office has a lone mechanised boat, usually reserved for the district magistrate.         
	It took the block office four days after Aila struck on May 25 to requisition private boats for relief work.        
	Monitoring relief and development work is a challenge in this area where travel time to places like Kumirmari and Lahiripur is between five and 6 hours, said Chakraborty.         
	Data from the block office suggest several central and state government schemes  like the national rural employment guarantee, old age pension and the Prime Ministers Gram Sadak Yojana  are running in Gosaba but deprivation and lack of development are all too apparent.        
	 We dont know where the money goes We have got just one tube well in our village of over 1,300 people, said Abbas Qazi, a resident of Arampur, around 3km from Gosaba.         
	Qazi was among hundreds of people sitting on the bank of the Durgaduani and hoping for some relief.         
	If records are any indication, co-ordination between the block office and the panchayats is virtually non-existent in most of the Sunderbans.         
	Every month, we have one review meeting with the panchayat pradhans in the block office. But only 30 to 40 per cent of them turn up, said a block official.         
	Irrigation minister Subh-as Naskar, an MLA from Basanti, admitted that the panchayat system was not yielding the desired results. By not attending the meetings, the pradhans are fooling people who vote for them. It seems to be an awareness problem and it has to be tackled, he said.

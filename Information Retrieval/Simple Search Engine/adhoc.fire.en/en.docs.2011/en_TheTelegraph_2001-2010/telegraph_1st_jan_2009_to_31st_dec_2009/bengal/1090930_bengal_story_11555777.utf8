                                                                                                               Constables relive scary 26 hours
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Kharagpur, Sept. 29: Two days after Maoists released him, constable Sisir Kanti Nag still shudders when asked about the blindfolded 26 hours in captivity.        
	Those were the most scary moments of my life. I was kept blindfolded so there was darkness all around me. I would keep seeing this image of my body riddled with bullets being put on a funeral pyre, Sisir, sitting in his house at Vidyasagar Pally in Kharagpur town, said.        
	Outside, his two children  son Santosh, 12 and daughter Sweta, 6  played Maobadi, enacting how the Maoists had kept their father hostage. They are kids. They dont understand what I went through in those 26 hours. It was neither childs play nor a joke. I still shudder when I think about it, said Sisir.        
	Sisir and Jiteswar Prasad Singh, another constable, were kidnapped by the Maoists in West Midnapore on Saturday.        
	The rebels called up their wives and asked them to tell senior officers that their husbands would be killed if Chhatradhar Mahato, leader of the Maoist-backed Peoples Committee Against Police Atrocities, was not released. But both were set free on Sunday night because the kidnappers had found out they did not belong to reactionary families.        
	Sisirs wife Dalia is sure she will never let her children join the police force.         
	Recounting Saturdays experience, Sisir said he and Jiteswar were in a private bus going to Banspahari to join work at a police camp there.         
	At Tamajuri, the Maoists waved the bus to stop. Five people got on to the bus by the rear door. They approached us from behind, covered our faces with their hands and pointed something at the back of our heads which felt like the nozzle of a revolver. We were ordered to get off the bus. As soon as we got down, they blindfolded us with gamchhas, said Sisir.        
	Jiteswar, also back in Kharagpur, said: Hum ney to soch liya tha ki mera life khatam. Kabi sochahi nahi tha ki parivar ke pas laut aunga (I had thought I would die. I never thought that I would return to my family).         
	When Sisir and I were taken off the bus, I did not even take my bag in which I had my uniform. I thought it was no use as they would kill me. During our confinement, Sisir wanted to smoke but they would not allow it. They told him that the police may be alerted by the smoke, said Jiteswar.        
	Both policemen said the Maoists did not hurt them. They were given rice, vegetables and puffed rice to eat. But police sources said one of the Maoists hit Jiteswar with his fist and Sisir was beaten up with a stick.         
	The two were released about 2km from a police camp at Chhurimara but lost their way in the darkness.

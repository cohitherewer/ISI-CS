The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Father kills son for rakhi
                                                                                                               Father kills son for rakhi
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Behrampore, Aug. 5: A young mason today killed his five-year-old only son because he had wasted Rs 10 on a rakhi.        
	Ruhul Amin first beat up his wife Rubeya for giving the boy money to buy the wristband. When Rubeya managed to run away from him, Ruhul picked up an iron spatula that he used to mix cement and hit son Rakesh on the head.        
	Bleeding profusely, the boy was dead by the time he was taken to a hospital.        
	Ruhul, 27, who works in Calcutta and earns about Rs 3,000 a month, had come home on holiday a week ago.        
	Around nine this morning  the day of Raksha Bandhan  Rakesh saw other children buy rakhis from the lone village grocery about 100 metres from their house.        
	Rubeya, still unable to believe her only son is no more, said: His friends told him they were all buying rakhis. He begged me for one and leapt in joy when I gave him Rs 10.         
	Rakesh ran out of home after that and returned dancing with joy, the glitzy band tied to his wrist.         
	Ruhul returned from a fri-ends place an hour later, saw Rakeshs wrist and blew his top. He called his wife and demanded an explanation.         
	I tried to argue with my husband that every child in the village had bought a rakhi today. Since Rakesh did not have a sister, a friend had tied it around his wrist. It was a harmless thing but my husband wouldnt listen, said Rubeya.        
	In a fit of rage, Ruhul hit Rubeya and allegedly tried to throttle her. Seeing his father so angry, Rakesh stood up on the bed and started crying.        
	I somehow managed to free myself. My husband then picked up the spatula and hit Rakesh. He collapsed. I ran out and raised the alarm, said Rubeya, 22.         
	Hearing her, Ruhuls father came running. Villagers took Rakesh to the Islampur rural health centre, 3km away, where he was declared dead.         
	When police came to Nasipur village to pick up Ruhul, he did not resist.        
	It is an unfortunate incident. We have arrested Ruhul, said Domkol subdivisional police officer Amit Javalgi.        
	Rabban Ali, 50, a neighbour, said it was beyond comprehension how Ruhul could kill the son he so dearly loved.

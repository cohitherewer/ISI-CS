The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | In the absence of trust, fear rules 
                                                                                                               In the absence of trust, fear rules 
          PRONAB MONDAL AND NARESH JANA                          A poster at Shirshi village purportedly written by a CPM supporter announces his voluntary decision to quit the party. It describes the CPM as a party of murderers and rapists. Picture by Samir Mondal                                  
	July 12: The murders at Shirshi village have punctured the sense of relief among villagers after security forces marched into the Maoist-held pockets of Lalgarh, and served a reminder that the guerrillas are still within striking distance.        
	The way the Maoists went around the village on Friday evening with a list of CPM supporters shows how fearless they are. I hid inside a house trembling with fear and was lucky to go unnoticed. I fled the next morning, said Dipen Mahato, 35, a member of the local Dherua gram panchayat.         
	Ration dealer Baren Mahato and sal leaf trader Gurucharan Mahato were dragged away from their homes and shot dead.         
	Like Dipen, many fled Shirshi and neighbouring villages such as Chuashol, Bera, Sundarlata and Champashole after the murders.         
	The presence of 50 companies  5,000 personnel  of the armed forces in the region is apparently no deterrent for the guerrillas because the villagers dont trust the local police. The law-enforcers are struggling to put together an intelligence network.        
	A CRPF officer now posted in Lalgarh said the central forces had done their bit and it was now the polices job to follow it up. We have reached places that were inaccessible to the police for seven months and completed area domination exercises. Now, collecting specific information about the guerrillas, conducting raids and tracking them down are the polices job, he said.        
	That is an uphill task in an environment where villagers do not trust the police. An officer said: If the villagers dont trust the police, rebuilding the intelligence network will be impossible. The force has to ensure it doesnt become the source of a grudge as the genesis of the Lalgarh trouble lies in that.         
	However, in the past few weeks too the police have been accused of arresting innocent people and ransacking homes after failing to find wanted rebels.        
	A wrong arrest can completely destroy the local intelligence network. But the police have repeatedly booked tribals on charges of waging war against the state and failed to prove them in court, said an intelligence branch officer.        
	The Maoists apparently have a far better intelligence-gathering system than the police and pick out police informers with ease. They have killed many for supplying information to the police. We cant expect a villager to turn up with specific information about guerrillas in a Maoist hotbed, the officer said.        
	Policemen assigned to develop the network will have to build their own image and instil confidence among the villagers gradually. Winning over their hearts is more important than impressing superiors by arresting suspected Maoists.        
	Shirshi village, 15km from Lalgarh, is in a forest area linked with the dense Jhitka and Pirakata forests. It is about 10km from the nearest police camp at Dharampur.        
	Inspector-general Kuldiep Singh admitted the police had not been able to flush out the rebels from the forests. The jungles covering Pingboni, Kadashole, Kantapahari and Jhitka are inter-linked and the guerrillas can go from one place to another freely, he said.        
	The Peoples Committee Against Police Atrocities today held its first open meeting since the forces moved into the region. About 7km from Lalgarh town, Chhatradhar Mahato, a committee leader wanted by the police, addressed a gathering of about 50 villagers.        
	So scared is Shirshi of the Maoists that the families of the slain CPM supporters refused to take their bodies back from Midnapore town, where they had been taken for post-mortem.         
	We offered full security. But they refused, the district police chief said.        
	Barens eldest son Sasanka, 34, said: Where were they when the Maoists struck? The police will provide security today. What about tomorrow?

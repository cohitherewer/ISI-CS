The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Fans many, not voters
                                                                                                               Fans many, not voters
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                          Consolation prize: A rare CPM celebration in Siliguri after the results were announced. (Kundan Yolmo)                                  
	Siliguri, Sept. 15: Asok Bhattacharya is a man betrayed today.        
	Sitting in the CPM office on Hill Cart Road, from where he has drawn up grandiose plans for Siliguri over the years, the urban development minister said: I had never expected the people who had rallied around me for all these years to desert me like this. The loss of the Siliguri Municipal Corporation is as much of a defeat for all my plans and development programmes as it is for the party.         
	Ever since he was the chairman of the municipality  a post he relinquished in 1994 to become the MLA from Siliguri for four consecutive terms  Bhattacharya had been nurturing his constituency.         
	Many Siliguri residents feel that it was under Bhattacharya that the character of the town changed into something more than being a transit point between the Northeast states and the rest of the country.        
	As the municipal affairs minister, he made sure that the civic body delivered. He had ensured the implementation and completion of crucial projects to ease the traffic congestion here by constructing the flyover at Mahabirsthan as well as the bypass between here and New Jalpaiguri, a resident said.        
	Bhattacharya regaled the town by holding frequent sports events where his favourite, Sourav Ganguly, and Sania Mirza made their appearance. He improved the grounds of the Kanchenjungha Stadium. It can now host Ranji Trophy matches, the only one to do so outside Calcutta. He built an indoor stadium, said a sports enthusiast.        
	So, why did Bhattacharyas efforts result in naught? By his own admission, the people voted for change. We had thrust our campaign on development and issues related to the betterment of the city and its residents, but the people rejected us politically, a dejected Bhattacharya said after the final results were out late in the afternoon.        
	There was a sense of betrayal in his reaction to the results. There are many who took part in our rallies and walked with us in our roadshows and door-to-door campaigns. But the results indicate that a good many of them did not vote in our favour, Bhattacharya said. We will have to win back their confidence.

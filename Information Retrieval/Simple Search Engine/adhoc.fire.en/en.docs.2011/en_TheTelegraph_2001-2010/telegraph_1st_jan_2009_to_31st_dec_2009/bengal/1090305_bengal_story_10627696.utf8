	Bolpur, March 4: A Birbhum teenager has been arrested for allegedly duping people into giving lakhs of rupees and jewellery by promising to double them using his supernatural powers.        
	Police said Notan Mondal, a farmers son who has stud- ied only till Class VI, used an ingenious ploy to swindle Rs 6 lakh and some 240 grams of gold out of the residents of Kastur village over the past three months. He took Rs 2,000 each from 10 and returned Rs 4,000 to five. But the people who had their money doubled spread the word and others started believing the 18-year-olds claims, said Debashis Chattoraj, the officer in charge of Labhpur, 250km from Calcutta.        
	One January morning, he claimed to have seen Lord Siv and attained the power to double jewellery as well. Bring all your cash and jewellery, he said, farmer Tapu Pal, 37, alleged. Tapu gave him Rs 3,000 and all his wifes jewellery, which weighed around 60 grams. Nineteen others followed.         
	A gram of gold was priced at Rs 1,526 in Calcutta today.        
	Notan fled home when people started chasing him for the returns. His parents, too, have fled. But his father said from a relatives place that they had no idea about what their son was up to.        
	Notan was hiding at friends house 20km from his home, but one of his own relatives tipped off the police.

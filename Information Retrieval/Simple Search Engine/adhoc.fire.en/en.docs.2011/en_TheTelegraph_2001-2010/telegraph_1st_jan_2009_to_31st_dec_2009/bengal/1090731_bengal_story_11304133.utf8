          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Lalgarh, July 30: Two police constables were reported missing after they left Lalgarh for a camp 10km away, less than a week after Maoists kidnapped an assistant sub-inspector.        
	Kanchan Giri and Sahib Mollah of the state armed police, deployed for the Lalgarh operation, have not been traced since this afternoon. The two had reached Lalgarh town from their camp in Dharampur on a motorcycle to collect petrol.        
	After reaching Lalgarh, they reported to the police station there, collected the petrol and left for Dharampur around 3pm. They were last seen by villagers in Brindabanpur, 4km from Lalgarh.        
	The constables took 10 litres of petrol and looked for a mechanic, said an officer of Lalgarh police station. The generator at the Dharampur camp has broken down and a mechanic was required.         
	People in Brindabanpur told us that they saw two men riding by on a bike around 3.30pm, an officer said. It must have been them.        
	The police said the two were on a red Hero Honda. They were in civilian clothes and unarmed. ASI Dipak Pramanik, who was kidnapped on July 24, was also in plainclothes and unarmed. But Pramanik was released the next day.         
	Manoj Verma, the West Midnapore SP, said that most likely, Giri and Mollah had been kidnapped by Maoists. He added that they could have been taken to Tarkilata forest, 8km away.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Security success: 15km trek to cover 2.5km   Hot pursuit but Bikash escapes
                                                                                                               Security success: 15km trek to cover 2.5km 
  Hot pursuit but Bikash escapes										      BACK TO LALGARH                        Security forces in Lalgarh during the anti-Maoist operation. File picture				                                 
	Sujan Dutta, who covered the Lalgarh operation for The Telegraph, returns to the zone after two months              
	Lalgarh, Aug. 31: A central police officer here says the most successful offensive against the Maoists in the two months since the combined forces entered Lalgarh took place on July 20 at a village named Tetultala.        
	It is a success story in the lab called Lalgarh  as the Centre describes the zone. This is how the police define success:        
	A contingent of the police, acting on intelligence from mobile phone intercepts, began advancing off-the-road towards Tetultala, a hamlet near Kadashole, north from the Lalgarh police station. The distance from the starting point to the target area was 2.5km.        
	But we covered more than 15km in the night to reach it, encircle it and conduct searches, said the officer. It was our biggest success.        
	The reason: the forces engaged the Maoists in battle in the forests on the outskirts of the hamlet. They opened fire with medium machine guns. The Maoists, he said, used automatic firearms, probably a light machine gun, and set off explosives planted in the road and in the fields to deter the police.        
	The officer believes  again, on the basis of mobile phone intercepts  that at least three members of the Maoist armed squad were killed and six injured.        
	The police also believe that in another hot pursuit, Bikash, the Maoist commander suspected to be in charge of his partys squads all over Lalgarh, was chased for 18km.        
	Despite his knowledge of the terrain  Bikash is from the area and the police suspect the name is an alias for Sasadhar Mahato, Peoples Committee Against Police Atrocities chief Chhatradhar Mahatos brother  he is understood to have lost his way in a forest till he was guided by his comrades.        
	Military operations against the Maoists have strange yardsticks for success: such as, 15km to reach a target merely 2.5km away and 18km of hot pursuit to nab a quarry who still manages to flee.        
	The central forces are armed with night-vision devices to spot figures in the dark more than a kilometre away, two-inch and 84mm mortars, and the standard-issue AK-47 and Insas rifles.        
	Between June 29, when the police linked up in Kantapahari to ring a circle of domination, and now, there have been more than 25 engagements between the Maoists and the security forces  at the rate of one every two days. These have been mostly in the forests.        
	A two-inch map of the zone that the security forces now use  obviously gathered from a remote-sensing agency  shows that nearly 60 per cent of the area is forested.        
	But it is not hilly. Indeed, for the CRPF companies that are battle-hardened, this terrain is friendly, unlike Kashmir and the Northeast. The Bengal police, of course, say the topography is hostile.        
	There has to be a period of familiarisation, said district magistrate Narayan Sarup Nigam. But now the police are going after them (the Maoists) in the forests.        
	He said the police were in the middle of the toughest part of Operation Lalgarh. Phase I  the road-opening bit  was easy but now there has to be a stop to general crime.        
	The claim of 25 engagements between the Maoists and police pales in comparison with the statistic on general crime. There have been at least 26 killings, mostly of tribals suspected by the rebels to be police informers.        
	The rebels have shown they are as intolerant of dissent as the CPM has been.        
	Despite its claims that it is an army of the people of Lalgarh, the CPI (Maoist) is guilty of hauling its targets to hastily summoned kangaroo courts  as in Madhupur the day before yesterday  and summarily executing them.        
	Even if their victims have been, or had a connection with the CPM, they were still hungry tribals driven to desperation, the very people in whose name the Maoists are waging their armed struggle.        
	By shooting, chopping and beating to death such poor people because of real or perceived dissent, the Maoists risk replicating the same repressive forms of state and political power that they are claiming to fight against.

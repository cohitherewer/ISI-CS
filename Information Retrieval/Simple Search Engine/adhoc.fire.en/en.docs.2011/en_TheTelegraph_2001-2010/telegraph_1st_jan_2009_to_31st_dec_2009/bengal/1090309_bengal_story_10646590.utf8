The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | School kid plays cannabis courier
                                                                                                               School kid plays cannabis courier
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Tamluk, March 8: A boy who finished writing his Madhyamik examination days ago was arrested last evening after he got off a train and took the other way instead of going towards the stations exit with a heavy-looking bag.        
	Police said it had 15kg of ganja, worth over Rs 2 lakh.        
	When Railway Protection Force jawans caught up with the 16-year-old down the tracks at Mecheda station, 75km from Calcutta, he said he was trying to avoid the exit because he did not have a ticket.        
	All the other passengers who got down from the train were going towards the main gate. So we asked the boy where he was heading. He told us he had lost his ticket. We took him to the ticket checkers room, said Sanjay Hazra, the RPF officer-in-charge at Mecheda, East Midnapore.         
	The ticket checkers told the police they smelt something in his bag. In this age of bomb scares, the first thing the railway policemen did was get hold of a metal detector. However, the device hasnt been programmed to sniff out cannabis. The smell continued to raise questions.         
	We started grilling the boy and he broke down and confessed that it contained ganja, the RPF officer said.         
	The schoolboy was apparently working as a courier for a gang, a job he is said to have done several times before. His job was to receive the ganja from Burdwan station and hand it over to contacts working for a person called Arup in Nandakumar (about 25km from Mecheda by road). He did the trip thrice in the past six months and got Rs 20,000 for each assignment, an RPF officer said.        
	The boy lives in Mahishadal, about 35km from Mecheda, where his father is a farm labourer.         
	Although held under the narcotics act, he cannot be sentenced to jail for being a minor, said a Tamluk lawyer.         
	The boy has been sent to a government-run home in Midnapore town. The Juvenile Justice Board in Salt Lake, where he will be produced tomorrow, will decide how long he will have to stay there.

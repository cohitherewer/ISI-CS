The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Buddha woos his bunking babus
                                                                                                               Buddha woos his bunking babus
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Bhattacharjee at the rally in Calcutta. (Sanat Kumar Sinha)                                  
	Calcutta, Feb. 19: Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee today humoured state government employees, at times at the expense of the exchequer, with an eye on the approaching general election.         
	The chief minister known for his industry-friendly, do-it-now image first slammed the media for criticising the governments work culture at a meeting of the CPM-controlled Coordination Committee of State Government Employees at Rani Rashmoni Avenue.         
	The Opposition and some (in the) media are angry with you for your support to us. The media questions your work culture. You know it that there is scope for improving the work culture in offices. But who monitors their work culture? he asked.        
	The rally itself was probably the best evidence of government laxity  the attendance of around 50,000 on Rani Rashmoni Avenue where evening traffic was choked for three hours and the deserted Writers on a weekday. Committee general secretary Ananta Banerjee said police erected the podium in the middle lane to stop the traffic citing the chief ministers security.         
	He was, however, evasive on why the committee held a rally on a weekday. We have taken leave for half the day or the entire day, he said.         
	Bhattacharjee referred to the difficult situation because of the global meltdown and the financial crisis the state had been reeling under for last few years, but the governments commitments to its employees stood, he said.         
	Though our financial crisis is not over, we will be able to somehow manage the situation. The major recommendations of the state pay commission would be implemented, hopefully on April 1, he said. The pay hike will add a burden of over Rs 6,000 crore to the current salary bill.         
	The cabinet had said casual workers who had put in 10 years would be made permanent. Bhattacharjee gave more hope. All casual staff would be made permanent as early as possible. The cabinet has decided not to engage casual staff anymore, he said.

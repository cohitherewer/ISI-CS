The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | CPM laughs as rival rails
                                                                                                               CPM laughs as rival rails
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Calcutta, Oct. 27: The CPM today had reason to rejoice as it got an opportunity to wag its finger at Mamata Banerjee when the Maoist-backed Peoples Committee Against Police Atrocities stopped the Rajdhani Express in West Midnapore.        
	The very moment she was criticising the joint operation and demanding their withdrawal by complaining of state-sponsored terror, the Maoists had stopped the Rajdhani Express. But she was in such a mood to slam the government, she refused to listen to her officials who tried to inform her about the Maoist siege, said CPM state secretariat member Mohammed Salim.        
	As she chose not to condemn the Maoist-backed committee which had laid siege to the Rajdhani  in her appeal Mamata said whoever has done it should lift the blockade for the sake of innocent passengers stranded for hours  the CPM again harped on the Mamata-Maoist nexus.         
	She did not criticise the Maoists after the train siege. Maoist leader Kishanji denied the responsibility for the siege but offered to meditate and wanted Mamata to talk. Now who should be suspect of staged games? Salim asked.        
	The CPM used the train siege to question her concern for the stranded passengers.         
	She was indifferent and irresponsible towards the safety of passengers even after the incident. She was more interested in highlighting the grievances of the families of the two missing constables, Salim said, referring to Mamatas meeting with Union home minister P. Chidambaram with the families of Kanchan Garai and Sabir Mollah.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Jadavpur thorn for Mamata
                                                                                                               Jadavpur thorn for Mamata
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                            Suman and Saifuddin                                 
	Calcutta, March 18: Mamata Banerjees bid to wrest Jadavpur ran into an unexpected obstacle today when a key ally fielded its president from the showcase seat.        
	The Party for Democratic Socialism (PDS) did not try to conceal its intent to mine the field for the Trinamul Congresss Kabir Suman. His contender: Saifuddin Chowdhury.        
	Having fought several political battles standing by her (Mamatas) side over the past few months, we genuinely believed she would acknowledge our value and give us at least one parliamentary seat to contest. We had put across our position, but Trinamul and the Congress chose not to accommodate us in their seat-sharing deal, said party general secretary Samir Putatunda.         
	Jadavpur had been getting ready for a polarised battle between the sitting CPM MP, Sujan Chakraborty, and Suman.         
	Trinamuls opponents think the presence of Chowdhury and a BJP candidate will push the odds in their favour. But Trinamul leader Subrata Bakshi said: It will not be easy for the CPM.        
	In fielding Saifuddin, the PDS actually emulated another Trinamul ally, the SUCI. It has fielded candidates in nine of the 14 seats Mamata has spared for the Congress. The Congress brass have left it to Mamata to sort out the tangle.         
	Mamata has sought to make light of the SUCI challenge, saying its candidates will also cut into Left votes, but the Congress leadership is far from pleased with the logic.        
	The SUCI has refused to budge, saying what binds Trinamul and the Congress is an understanding, not an alliance, and the SUCI has no obligation to honour it.         
	The PDS leadership said it was equally free to field its own candidates. We continue to be a part of the (Trinamul-led) Save Farmland Committee, but when it comes to elections, we are on our own, said Putatunda.        
	The PDS and the SUCI are not the only worries for Mamata. The Mazdoor Kranti Parishad, a minor but old ally that was active in Mamatas Singur movement, has decided to field candidates in Serampore, Bolpur and Basirhat, where Trinamul nominees are in the fray.         
	The PDS, a breakaway from the CPM, picked Jadavpur to try and torment Mamata for a combination of factors.         
	First, being rooted in South 24-Parganas, its leaders en-joy pockets of influence in the Jadavpur-Diamond Harbour-Mathurapur belt and quicker access to resources.         
	Second, the concentration of Muslim voters  estimated at about 22 per cent following inclusion of portions of Sonarpur, Baruipur, Bhangar and Joynagar after delimitation  will make it easier for Chowdhury, an articulate and non-controversial politician, to work, the party reckons.         
	Third, Chowdhurys clean image and liberal views, especially on industrialisation which runs counter to Mamatas, are expected to go down well with the middle-class, educated voter.         
	Additionally, he may provide a choice for disgruntled Congress and Left supporters who may have been feeling a certain unease in the absence of a third alternative.         
	A former MP, Chowdhury had unsuccessfully contested from Katwa in 2004.         
	We had been looking for a constituency that will be easy to handle in terms of location, voter concentration, familiarity and costs. Jadavpur fits the bill, said Putatunda, secretary of the CPMs South 24-Parganas unit till his expulsion from the party, along with Chowdhury, in 2001.

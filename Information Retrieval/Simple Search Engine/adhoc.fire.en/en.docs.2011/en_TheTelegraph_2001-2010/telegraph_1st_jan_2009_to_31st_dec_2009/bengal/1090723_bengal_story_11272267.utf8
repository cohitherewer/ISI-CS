The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Rebels butcher CPM leader
                                                                                                               Rebels butcher CPM leader
  - Minutes after homecoming, 14 bullets pumped in as son looks on        OUR CORRESPONDENT                                                  
	Midnapore, July 22: Maoists today riddled a CPM leader with bullets minutes after he returned to his village following six months in hiding, throwing the gauntlet at those planning a paramilitary crackdown along the Jharkhand border.        
	Fourteen bullets were pumped into Fagu Baskey in a village in West Midnapores Belpahari only about 500 metres from the neighbouring state as his son and a host of other farmers looked on, transfixed.        
	Some 50km from Lalgarh, the place is in the stretch where the Bengal government wants to conduct a joint operation with Jharkhand to weed out the guerrillas.        
	Baskey was eager to start tilling his land as the rains had started. Before going home today, he went to see the fields where his son Hemanta was already at work. As he looked at his rain-drenched five bighas, ready to take paddy saplings, five men surrounded him.         
	They were in Bermudas and shirts, with towels wrapped around their heads and pistols in hand.        
	A man who identified himself as Maoist leader Rakesh claimed responsibility for the murder tonight.        
	A branch committee secretary of the CPM in Madhupur village, Baskey had fled home after suspected Maoist action squad member Nikhil Mahato was arrested.         
	After the arrest, the Maoists had issued death threats to Baskey for allegedly tipping off the police. He spent the past six months at the CPM office in Belpahari town, about 10km away, a police officer said.         
	Nikhil was recently released on bail.        
	The murder showed how superior the Maoists intelligence network was compared with the polices. Senior officers conceded that their information-gathering system had collapsed. The assailants knew exactly when Baskey would return, said an officer.        
	With the police wary of conducting raids since the tribal resistance began in Lalgarh late last year, it is unlikely they would be able to break the Maoist machinery easily.        
	Todays strike took the number of CPM sympathisers killed since the Lalgarh operation began last month to seven.        
	The state government has said it wants to launch Lalgarh-type operations in all Maoist-hit areas. The Bengal police chief went to Ranch in early July to discuss a joint operation to flush out the Maoists with his Jharkhand counterpart.        
	Police sources said among the assailants at Madhupur were two from the village itself. They are apparently associated with the Jharkhand Party (Naren), which has often been accused by the CPM of be- ing in cahoots with the rebels.        
	Hemanta said his father was inspecting a ditch to hold water in the rain-starved region when attacked. In our areas, the entire cultivation is rain-based as there is virtually no irrigation facility. My father was eager to supervise the arrangements for storage of water for cultivation.        
	Hemanta was at the other end of their plot. We had grown some long beans there. There were other farmers scattered in the distance. I saw the five men surround my father and heard 14 shots. We did not dare chase them.        
	After the murder, the assailants strolled towards the Kanaisar forest that leads to Jharkhand.        
	Baskey was a graduate. He had done his BA from Jhargram Raj College.         
	West Midnapore superintendent of police Manoj Verma said: Two people in the gang were identified as supporters of a political party. We are finding out if they are involved with the guerrillas.        
	He added that the police had busted in March a camp run by the Maoists in Belpahari to train villagers in the use of firearms.

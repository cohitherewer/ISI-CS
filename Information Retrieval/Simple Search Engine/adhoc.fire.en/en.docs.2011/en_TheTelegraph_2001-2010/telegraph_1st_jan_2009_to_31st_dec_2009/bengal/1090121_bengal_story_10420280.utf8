The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Minister quizzes CM on casual staff
                                                                                                               Minister quizzes CM on casual staff
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                            Chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee amp; irrigation minister Subhas Naskar                                 
	Calcutta, Jan. 20: A minister today protested when the chief minister announced at a cabinet meeting that 10 casual employees of his information and cultural affairs department would be made permanent.        
	Raising his hand to draw Buddhadeb Bhattacharjees attention, irrigation minister Subhas Naskar apparently asked that if the information ministry was absorbing casual workers, what about those in his department for years.         
	No casual worker has been made permanent in my department since 1991. There are a lot of casual workers in the PWD and irrigation departments, Naskar told the chief minister.         
	The irrigation and PWD ministries are held by the CPM ally RSP.        
	The chief minister res- ponded to Naskar immediately. I know. Kshitibabu (PWD minister Kshiti Goswami) had also told me about it and it is a matter of concern for all of us, he said and asked all his cabinet colleagues to submit a list of casual employees working for 10 years or more.        
	Well definitely look into it, the chief minister said.        
	A finance ministry official said the last time a casual employee had been made permanent was way back in December 1991.        
	An official of the infor- mation department, which is under the chief minister, said the 10 employees being made permanent were posted at various cultural centres and auditoriums.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Opinion differs in Lalgarh   Police-or-poll debate
                                                                                                               Opinion differs in Lalgarh     -  Police-or-poll debate
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                          Chhatradhar Mahato: Under Maoist pressure?                                        
	Midnapore, April 13: The conduct of elections in Lalgarh is caught between the conflicting pulls of Maoists who are apparently resisting a proposal to let in central forces and a section of tribals which wants the polls to go ahead so that scores can be settled with the CPM.        
	The leader of the tribal movement in Lalgarh, Chhatradhar Mahato, today indicated that no police, even if central or from other states, would be allowed to enter the area for the general election. The final decision is expected tomorrow.        
	Mahato told The Telegraph today: It does not matter where the policemen are coming from, whether from Bengal or some other state. The fact is that the people of Lalgarh hate policemen and detest their uniform. So they dont want any police, from any state.        
	After a meeting with the states chief electoral officer yesterday, Mahato had said the Peoples Committee Against Police Atrocities would think about whether or not to allow the police into Lalgarh. The statement had raised hopes in the administration and the Election Commission about the prospects of a free and fair poll under police supervision on April 30.        
	Chief electoral officer Debashis Sen had promised Mahato that the central forces would not stay back in Lalgarh, as some of the tribal leaders feared, because they would have to move to other places for the next phase of the polls.         
	However, intelligence sources said Maoists guiding the movement in Lalgarh prevailed upon Mahato not to agree to the commissions proposal when he returned there last night. The Maoists have made major inroads in Lalgarh and its surrounding areas in the past few months in the absence of the police and do not want the security forces there at any cost, an official said.         
	However, a section of the tribals is still trying to prevail upon Mahato and other leaders to allow the central forces in on the polling day. Their lo-gic: if the 50,000-odd tribals in Lalgarh boycott the elections, or if the polls are not held there, it is the CPM which stands to benefit.        
	Mahato has said he is not opposed to the elections, but to police presence in Lalgarh.         
	However, the poll panel has said the elections cannot be held without the police. Who will guarantee the safety of the polling personnel deployed there? state home secretary Ardhendu Sen had recently asked.        
	Those in Lalgarh pitching for polls under police drawn from the central forces, or even from other states, said they were supporting the Jharkhand Party (Aditya) for the Jhargram seat as the CPM must be defeated at any cost.        
	This group feels if the security force leaves Lalgarh immediately after the polls, they would have achieved their objective by voting as well as ensuring that the police left the area.         
	The pro-election group will try and influence Mahato during a meeting of the Peoples Committee tomorrow.

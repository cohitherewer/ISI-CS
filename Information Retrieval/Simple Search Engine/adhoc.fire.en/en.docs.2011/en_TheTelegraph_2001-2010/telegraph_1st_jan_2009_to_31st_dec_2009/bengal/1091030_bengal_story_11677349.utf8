The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | FIR politics, colour no bar   Mamata mum, CPM amnesiac
                                                                                                               FIR politics, colour no bar     Mamata mum, CPM amnesiac
          OUR BUREAU                                    
	Oct. 29: The bandh pot is calling the bandh kettle black.        
	The railways are pleading ignorance about the identity of those who blocked the Delhi-bound Rajdhani on Tues- day, though at least one of the spearheads has publicly crowed about leading the group.        
	Several people have seen Peoples Committee Against Police Atrocities leader Santosh Patra in the mob and passengers have spoken of a man by that name setting conditions for the trains release.        
	Patra, a wanted Maoist, again said today: I was there at Banstala.... We want (committee leader) Chhatradhar Mahatos release and the withdrawal of the forces.        
	Yet, the FIR filed by the railways yesterday does not mention a single name.         
	The railway ministry is headed by Mamata Banerjee whose party has proved its mettle in inheriting the bandh mantle from the CPM. Mamata refused to speak on the FIR.        
	Such circumspection did not befall CPM leaders. State secretariat member Benoy Konar said the farce of an FIR again proved Mamata was hand-in-glove with the Maoists. This is a tamasha.        
	Few CPM leaders have used such words to describe their governments inaction when bandhs had tormented countless people and led to the destruction of public property.        
	True to that tradition, the FIR filed by Jhargram stationmaster Niranjan Singh said some agitators stopped the train with banner flag, broke some window glasses and did not allow it to move.        
	The state-run police machinery is also lamenting the absence of a proper FIR, betraying concern rarely shown during earlier blockades.        
	Dilip Mitra, the additional director-general of police, railways, called the FIR very vague. Mitra is part of the state police. Had someone been named, it would have made our task easier. We will probe the case on our own, he said.        
	Based on the FIR, the Government Railway Police, a state force, have started a case against unknown persons charging them with offences that carry a maximum punishment of two years in jail.        
	Senior railway officials said a stronger case could have been made against the demonstrators with the available evidence. A Maoist called Santosh Patra told the media Chhatradhar should be released and the forces withdrawn. Arent they enough proof of Maoist involvement? The statements of the train drivers, manager and ticket collectors could have been in the FIR, said one.         
	However, A.K. Singh, the chief security commandant of the Railway Protection Force in South Eastern Railway, defended the FIR. It is not possible for railway officials travelling on the train to identify demonstrators.         
	Trinamul general secretary Partha Chatterjee put the onus of proving who the culprits were on the police.         
	The names of Patra and several others figure on another FIR, filed by the state police and the CRPF against those who engaged them in a gun battle on their way to Banstala to secure the train. They have been charged with offences like waging war against the state, sedition and rioting.

	Bhubaneswar, Oct. 31: The two men accused of stealing marmosets from Alipore zoo in September have confessed to have stolen a pair of macaws from Bhubaneswars Nandankanan in July.         
	Rajesh Singh and Raj Sa- ikia, who were arrested by Calcutta police in September, were brought to the zoo here yesterday as part of the probe into the bird thefts. The two told the police they committed the theft on July 25. They had hired a zoo guide and asked him to leave after reaching the bird cage, an officer said.

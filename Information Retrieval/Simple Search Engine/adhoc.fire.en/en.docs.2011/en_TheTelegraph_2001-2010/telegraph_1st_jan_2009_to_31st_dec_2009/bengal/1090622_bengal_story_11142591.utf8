The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Lay down arms: Govt
                                                                                                               Lay down arms: Govt
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Calcutta, June 21: The state today appealed to Maoists to lay down their arms so peace and normality could be restored in Lalgarh, shops and healthcare facilities reopened and people returned to work.         
	The Maoists have been terrorising villagers and extorting money. People are frightened. We appeal to them (the Maoists) to lay down arms so that normality can return to the area at the earliest, chief secretary Asok Mohan Chakrabarti said after a series of meetings with the chief minister. The home secretary, director-general of police (co-ordination) and inspector-general (law and order) also attended.        
	The government believes the Peoples Committee Against Police Atrocities is hand in glove with the Maoists. Weve been watching the TV interviews of the Maoist leaders as well as those of the PCPA. They are raising the same issues. We are certain there is a nexus between the two and they are organising the unrest jointly, Chakrabarti said.        
	He ruled out talks with the Maoists at this stage. They have first got to lay down their arms. We cant hold talks with them pointing a gun at us.        
	Asked if the face of the Lalgarh resistance, Chhatradhar Mahato, would be arrested, Chakrabarti said everyone who has engaged in activities listed as punishable under the Indian Penal Code would be held and tried.        
	He admitted that many in the troubled area did not have food as shops were closed. The government has sanctioned funds and asked the district magistrate to ensure the villagers had access to provisions.        
	The government has decided to pay Rs 2 lakh to the family of the CRPF jawan who died of heat stroke yesterday in addition to the compensation he would receive from the Centre.

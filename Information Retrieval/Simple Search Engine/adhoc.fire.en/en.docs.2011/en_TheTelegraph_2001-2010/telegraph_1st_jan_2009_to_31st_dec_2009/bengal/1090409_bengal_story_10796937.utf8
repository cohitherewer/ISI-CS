The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Airport city trimmed to save coal
                                                                                                               Airport city trimmed to save coal
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Calcutta, April 8: The proposed airport city in Burdwans Andal will be 400 acres smaller and three steel plants planned in its vicinity will be relocated to protect vast coal reserves underground.        
	The formula to lift the coal cloud on Bengal Aerotropolis was finalised at a meeting between the Coal India chairman and senior state officials at Writers Buildings today.        
	Coal India had objected to the project saying the reserves in the area would become inaccessible.         
	The Aerotropolis will have a township, an airport, a golf course and entertainment hubs spread across 3,500 acres. A consortium of three companies is promoting it with the West Bengal Industrial Development Corporation (WBIDC) playing the facilitator.         
	Industries secretary Sab- yasachi Sen said: The state and Coal India have worked out a respectable and reasonable solution on the basis of which we can go ahead.         
	The 3,500-acre project area will be curtailed by 400 acres. Three proposed steel plants in the Burdwan-Durgapur belt will be relocated so that Coal India gets access to a big quantum of coal reserves there. Coal extraction is in national interest and cant be compromised. On the basis of todays discussions, the state and the Union governments will talk after the Lok Sabha polls.        
	Sen added that shifting the proposed Abhijeet Group, Bhushan and Videocon steel projects would not be a problem as no land had been acquired for any of them. Relocating these projects half a mile or a kilo-metre to the east, towards Burdwan, wouldnt be a problem. Each of these steel plants re- quires around 2,000 acres. WBIDC officials will talk to the investors and I hope they will be able to persuade them.        
	However, another cloud hangs over the airport city project. A section of villagers has set up a save-farmland committee led by the Trinamul Congress and Naxalites and is demanding Rs 18 lakh an acre as compensation. The government has offered between Rs 7.5 lakh and Rs 11.5 lakh an acre depending on the fertility of the land and its proximity to the highway (NH 2).         
	The villagers have threatened an agitation on the lines of Singur and Nandigram if their demands  which includes direct with the promoters  are not met. The industries secretary said the government would consult Eastern Coalfields whenever proposals for industrial projects in the Asansol-Durgapur belt came in the future.         
	Coal India chairman P.S. Bhattacyharya said even after scaling down the Aerotropolis, the company would lose around 14 million tonnes of potential coal.         
	There will still be about 0.73sqkm of coal reserves lying under the project site and that will amount to around 14 million tonnes of coal. However, relocation of the proposed steel plants will allow us to exploit at least 14 million tonnes of subterranean coal.

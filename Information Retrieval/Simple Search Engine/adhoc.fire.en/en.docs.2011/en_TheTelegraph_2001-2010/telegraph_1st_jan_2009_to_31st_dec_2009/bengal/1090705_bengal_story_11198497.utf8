The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Cops wait to grill driver
                                                                                                               Cops wait to grill driver
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Howrah, July 4: The police are waiting for minibus driver Vivekananda Parui to recover so they can grill him.        
	After the accident, the 40-year-old from Sankrail was rushed with many others to Howrah District Hospital where doctors said his condition was serious.        
	Once he is declared fit to speak, we will grill him because the case primarily hinges on him, an officer said. We will look for his licence papers and check if he has a history of rash driving.        
	Parui has been charged with culpable homicide not amounting to murder and rash driving.         
	Preliminary investigations have indicated the bus was speeding and the driver lost control. A snag in the steering wheel has not been ruled out, though.        
	The police will also probe whether the mini had a speed governor, which limits the speed of a vehicle, in accordance with Calcutta High Court orders.        
	The Motor Vehicles Act has fixed the speed limit for all buses and minibuses in Calcutta and adjoining areas at 50kmph, and the speed governor ensures the driver does not cross this. This tool is mandatory under the high court order, and we will slap a case if it was not used, said D.P. Tarenia, IG, traffic.

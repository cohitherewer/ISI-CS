          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Nanoor, Nov. 4: Alleged CPM goons last night raided a Nanoor village 8km from where they had been beaten back by their Trinamul Congress rivals in the morning.        
	We were sleeping when there was loud banging on our doors. About 20 masked men entered the house and dragged me out, said Sephali Mete, 33, a housewife with a one-and-a-half-year-old son in her arms.        
	Like Sephalis, most houses in Patisara village are left with only women and children since their men fled under CPM threats in September.        
	They beat me up, broke the utensils and scattered the rice, added Sephali, wife of a former CPM supporter.        
	Patisara is under a panchayat from where the CPM was unseated this year following its members defection. The villages where yesterdays bomb battle took place are under the same Thupsara panchayat.         
	Tears streaming down, Dodhi Mete, 37, said the goons last night beat up her 10-year-old son and elderly mother-in-law.        
	Her husband, too, is homeless now.         
	After raiding eight houses, the marauders broke into a grocery and ransacked it.        
	A police officer said there was a team in the area but it must have been in some other village. No arrest has been made in connection with yesterdays clash. No ones lodged a complaint, the officer said.

	Siliguri, Oct. 8: Heavy showers in the past 48 hours triggered by a low pressure prevailing over the plains of Bihar and Uttar Pradesh have flooded many areas of Siliguri and other parts of north Bengal.         
	The flooding in Siliguri was compounded by the Mahishmari, flowing through the Mahananda Wildlife Sanctuary, that breached an already damaged embankment and discharged water into the Champasari area of the town.        
	The mayor, Gangotri Dutta, along with civic officials, including municipal commissioner, Paritosh Roy, visited the affected areas this morning and spoke to irrigation department engineers about the embankment breach. There are about 100 families, which are marooned at Champasari in Ward 46, and we distributed relief to them. A close watch is being kept on the situation, the mayor said after the visit.         
	Although the rain let up around 8.30 in the morning, Wards 4, 5, 23 and 46 are still waterlogged.         
	Sikha Roy, the councillor of Ward 46, said: A dam inside the Mahananda sanctuary was damaged about two years ago, but no repair has been carried out yet. The Mahishmari overflowed through the damaged portions of the dyke, causing waterlogging at Champasari. Similar flooding took place in August also. The residents had requested the previous civic board to look into the matter seriously, but no one listened to their plea and people are now suffering.        
	Back in office, Dutta said after conferring with civic officials: We have set up a camp at Samarnagar and are monitoring the situation. I have asked the municipal commissioner and the engineers of the corporation to take necessary measures to repair the dyke and improve drainage in the affected wards.         
	Gopinath Raha, the in-charge of the Flood and Meteorology office in Jalpaiguri, said: An upper air cyclonic circulation in the eastern part of Uttar Pradesh and adjacent Bihar has extended a trough towards western part of Assam, precipitating heavy rainfall in the region. Such weather is not normal at this time of the year.        
	According to the meteorological office of Jalpaiguri, the rainfall recorded over the past 24 hours was 233mm at Sevoke, 217.8mm at Champasari, 258.2mm at Jalpaig uri, 161.4mm at Alipurduar, 172.2mm at Kalimpong and 104mm at Gangtok.        
	Considering the changes in the weather, it is expected that the low pressure will remain in the region for at least seven more days and there is a possibility of rain also. Presently, a trough of low pressure in Bihar and Jharkhand is extending towards Gangetic West Bengal, which may cause heavy rainfall at some places in the state in the next 48 hours, said Raha.

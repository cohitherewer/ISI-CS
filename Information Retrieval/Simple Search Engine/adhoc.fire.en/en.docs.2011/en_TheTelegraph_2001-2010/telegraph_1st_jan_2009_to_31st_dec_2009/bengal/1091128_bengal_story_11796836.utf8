The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Mamata calls for PC visit
                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      Mamata calls for PC visit
          OUR BUREAU                              
	Calcutta, Nov. 27: Mamata Banerjee today demanded Union home minister P. Chidambarams immediate visit to Bengal to see for himself the lawlessness... unleashed by the CPM.         
	Yesterday, she had requested the Union home minister and finance minister to send a central team to Hooghlys Khanakul where alleged CPM cadres attacked two villages in a bid to recapture territory slipping out of their control and shot dead a Trinamul Congress supporter.         
	There is a constitutional breakdown because of the terror let loose by the CPM. The Centre cant sit idle. Chidambaramji should come here immediately, Mamata said.         
	The Trinamul chief told aides at a meeting that the party should keep pressuring the Centre to ensure Chidambaramjis visit.         
	I spoke to Chidambaramji yesterday to update him on the state of affairs across Bengal, where the CPM is trying to enforce its writ. I could make out that he was very concerned about the escalating violence, she told a news conference. Mamata claimed that Sonia Gandhi was also convinced when she briefed the Congress chief about how the CPM was trampling democracy.         
	The Trinamul leader iterated her demand for Presidents rule but hastened to add it was not because she wanted early polls. People have already given their mandate in favour of us by voting against the ruling CPM in successive elections. It doesnt matter whether the polls are brought forward or not. We are demanding the use of Article 356 to ensure peace.        
	The CPM expressed hope that the Centre wouldnt succumb to Mamatas pressure but state government sources said a team from Delhi was likely to arrive in two to three days and visit Khanakul.        
	Law and order is a state subject. We hope the Centre wouldnt succumb to Mamata Banerjees pressure. If it is concerned, it should also look into the mayhem by the Mamata-Maoist combine, said Basudev Acharya, the CPMs leader in the Lok Sabha.         
	State party secretary Bi- man Bose was cautious not to criticise the Congress or Chi-dambaram, whose support is crucial for the states anti-Maoist operations. I have heard that a central team is coming. Let it come. But what we need to contain the violence is an all-party meeting, he said.        
	The insistence on the peace meeting in Khanakul indicated the party brasss discomfort with the retaliatory violence and belligerence of district CPM leaders, which they fear might snowball into a situation that justifies the demand for central intervention.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Calcutta, Dec. 10: The chief minister today made a distinction between the Congress and its ally Trinamul Congress in the Assembly while responding to charges of his failure to contain violence.         
	When Congress leader Manas Bhuniya said bloodshed in the Lalgarh region had not abated despite the presence of a large contingent of central and state forces, Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee responded by castigating Trinamul as a hingsra (violent) party.         
	We want an all-party consensus to stop the violence. But it is difficult with such a violent Opposition party sitting with you, he said.         
	Apparently alluding to the Prime Ministers contention that the Maoists posed the biggest threat to internal security, he even accused Trinamul of compromising the national interest by conniving with the rebels. Some forces active in our state are supporting the Maoists, hurting national interests. Sections of the Jharkhand Party and, recently, Trinamul are supporting them.         
	While admitting deterioration of law and order in the Lalgarh region because of the Maoists, he also blamed Trinamul for general anarchy and violence. According to him, 69 people have been killed in the three Maoist-hit districts since November 13  47 from the CPM and 15 from Trinamul being among them.         
	He said the government was trying to seize illegal arms but also virtually admitted that his party had its own arsenal. The ruling party has its share of responsibility in maintaining peace, but the Opposition should also co-operate, he said, hinting at his disapproval of the growing clamour for an organised resistance within the CPM.         
	His comments on the alleged nexus with the Maoists and the Speakers refusal to expunge them prompted Trinamul to walk out. Its a debate and trading of political allegations is part of it, the Speaker said.        
	Trinamul House leader Partha Chatterjee described Bhattacharjee as rudderless and the Speaker as an Alimuddin Street stooge.         
	Trinamul leaders were not happy with the Congress either as they felt Bhuniya had helped the CPM highlight its toll in the Maoist violence.         
	Chatterjee spoke more on the figures Bhattacharjee furnished in reply to his question on the extent of violence in the state. According to the written reply, 1,720 people were killed, and 845 political clashes and 2,352 abductions took place this year till October 31.         
	The figures speak volumes about the states law and order and expose the chinks in the CPMs blame on Maoists and Trinamul for all the ills. The chief minister should specify how many of the murders are political, Chatterjee said.

                                                                                                               Haldia port channel
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                               
	Calcutta, Oct. 7: A technical advisory committee set up by Calcutta Port Trust to look into the navigability problem at Haldia has recommended opening a new channel in the Hooghly to allow better movement of ships.         
	The new channel, tentatively named Eden, will replace the existing Auckland channel that is prone to heavy siltation, restricting bigger ships from entering Haldia port.         
	The committee of senior port officials took the decision at Haldia after a long meeting late tonight.         
	The new channel is expected to increase water draught by two metres enabling ships to bring 10,000 tonnes of additional cargo. The port can also save on the yearly dredging cost of Rs 200 crore.         
	But it will be a wait of at least two years before the Eden channel opens up. The port will call for a global tender to dredge the new channel.

          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Calcutta, May 24: Mamata Banerjee will travel across the state with her six ministers and launch a movement against the CPMs alleged atrocities since the poll drubbing.        
	I shall go to the disturbed areas and launch a movement against the CPM, which has unleashed terror on people after the rout. The details will be worked out after my MPs are sworn in as ministers, Mamata told a news conference at her Kalighat house.        
	On her arrival from Delhi last night, she had said the Union ministers from her party would be expected to spend more time in the state than in the capital. My priority is Bengal I have made it absolutely clear... they will have to spend five days a week in Bengal.        
	A heavy security ring was thrown around the new railway minister today and supporters who came with bouquets and boxes of sweets were told to leave them outside a barricade, put up in front of her house. The flowers and sweets remained there all day.        
	The leader whod till the other day hug people and hold their hands when greeted was out of bounds. We cant help it if people are inconvenien- ced. We are working under instructions from the security people, said MLA Madan Mitra.         
	In addition to a dozen Calcutta police personnel already manning her house, six railway police jawans have been put on round-the-clock vigil.        
	Mamata said she had raised the CPMs terror tactics at the second UPAs first meeting in the capital on Wednes- day. Both Vayalar Ravi and A.K. Antony (Congress MPs from Kerala) supported me and mentioned how the CPM had unleashed a reign of terror in their state after the polls, she added.        
	The CPM, according to Mamata, has lost its moral right to continue in power in Bengal after the peoples mandate against the party in the Lok Sabha polls.        
	The Trinamul leader was also not happy that the state had renewed the lease to Tata Motors for the Singur plot. When we were busy with the polls, the government quietly renewed the lease, but I would take back the land forcibly acquired, she said.        
	Mausam demand        
	In Malda, new MP Mausam Noor said she will demand a Malda Rajdhani from Mamatadi and two Calcutta-Siliguri superfast trains via Malda.

	Calcutta, Jan. 9: Police detained a doctor tonight for allegedly clicking pictures of a woman patient on his cellphone.         
	A woman, in her thirties, had gone to the orthopaedic at a Baghajatin nursing home around 10pm. Her husband was with her. After coming out of the examination room, she said the doctor had taken pictures of her on his cellphone.         
	Residents gathered at the nursing home and handed over the doctor to police.         
	The doctor, in his fifties, has a past record of such behaviour, a resident said.

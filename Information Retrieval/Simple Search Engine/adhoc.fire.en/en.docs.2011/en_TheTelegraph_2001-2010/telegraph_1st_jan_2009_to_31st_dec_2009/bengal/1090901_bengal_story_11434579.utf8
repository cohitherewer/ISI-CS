	Aug. 31: Suspected Maoists thrashed a woman panchayat chief in Purulia last night because she had not obeyed their diktat a year ago to quit the CPM.        
	After beating up Latika Hembram, the group marched to a neighbouring village, shouting Maobad zindabad on the way, and shot dead CPM branch committee secretary Debiprasad Hansda while his aged parents fell at the rebels feet and begged for mercy.        
	The number of deaths in Maoist violence since Friday  when the first case was reported after the Lalgarh operation began  stands at three.        
	Around 8pm yesterday, about 30 guerrillas, armed with rifles, single-barrel guns and revolvers, marched to Nodudi village in the Ayodhya hills of Purulia. When they reached the village  Latika lives there  they warned the people not to step out of their houses.        
	On reaching Latikas hut they kicked open the door. Latika, 32, and her husband Gopal, a CPM worker, were sleeping in the courtyard. We asked you to quit the CPM a year ago. But you did not, the Maoists yelled at her.         
	Then they started hitting the couple using their rifle butts. If you dont quit the party now, you will be murdered, they shouted at me, Latika said from her bed in Purulia Sadar Hospital, where she and Gopal were admitted with several bruises. I will quit the CPM and resign from the panchayat. I cannot live in constant panic, she said.        
	Firing in the air, the Maoists left the Hembrams hut in Nodudi and marched 10km to Jitinglahar village to Debiprasads home.        
	Debiprasad was sleeping with his father Hiralal, 68. As soon as his mother opened the door, about 10 rebels rushed in, pushing her aside. Debiprasads parents fell at the feet of the Maoists, begging for their sons life.         
	The guerrillas kicked the 45-year-old CPM leader awake, then shot him twice in the chest. He died on the spot. They told him this was the price of his association with the corrupt CPM. Then they shot him twice, wept Hiralal.         
	Purulia superintendent of police Rajesh Yadav said it was difficult to prevent the attacks as the guerrillas are picking their targets at random.         
	In West Midnapore, the Maoists allegedly abducted a former CPM branch committee secretary, Sukdeb Mahato, 48, yesterday afternoon.         
	Another group of Maoists shot at Ujjal Kundu, a resident of Papuria who was the secretary of the CPM branch committee in Sijua, Lalgarh.         
	Last evening, when Ujjal was cycling to a relatives house in Bankura, where he spends the night to escape the Maoists, he was shot in the stomach. He has been admitted to a hospital.

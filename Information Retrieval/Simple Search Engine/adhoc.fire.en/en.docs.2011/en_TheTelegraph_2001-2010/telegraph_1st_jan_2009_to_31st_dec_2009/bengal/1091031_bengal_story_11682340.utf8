The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Citu assault on officers
                                                                                                               Citu assault on officers
                            
	Durgapur, Oct. 30: Citu supporters slapped and harassed Durgapur Steel Plant officials when they reported for work last night on the eve of a two-day strike called by the union at all SAIL units.        
	Electrical manager Soumen Das and assistant manager Rabindranath Jana had reported for work with essentials necessary to stay on inside in case the strike hit the next shift. They were assaulted and their bags snatched. Trainee executive S.K. Doluis bike keys were thrown into a shrub and he was told to find them. Officials of a software company on assignment at the plant were held up at another gate from 4am to 10.30am.         
	All of them were allowed to go in ultimately, but Jana did not get back his bag.        
	Spokesman B.R. Kanungo said 44 per cent of the workers reported for duty today and production was affected.

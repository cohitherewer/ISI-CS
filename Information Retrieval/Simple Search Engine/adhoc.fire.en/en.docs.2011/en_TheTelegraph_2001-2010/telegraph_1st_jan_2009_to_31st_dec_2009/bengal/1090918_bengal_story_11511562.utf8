The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Meeting on mayor
                                                                                                               Meeting on mayor
          BARUN GHOSH                              
	Calcutta, Sept. 17: The Congress and Trinamul will decide at the local level who will get the Siliguri mayors job, Pranab Mukherjee said today.        
	We have nothing much to say on the choice of the mayor for Siliguri. Local-level leaders will take a decision, the state Congress chief said over the phone from Delhi. Yesterday, Mukherjee and Mamata Banerjee met in Delhi.        
	A meeting between leaders from both parties is scheduled for Sunday in Siliguri. Trinamul MLA Partha Chatterjee and a state Congress leader will be present.         
	The Congress won 15 seats in the civic polls and Trinamul 14 but is believed to have the support of an Independent. Both have staked claim to the mayors post. A Trinamul source said it would be difficult to pressure the Congress that is strong in north Bengal.

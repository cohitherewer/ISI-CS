The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Two ways to play Singur googly   Scope for jobs but   loss of   weapon
                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      Two ways to play Singur googly     -  Scope for jobs but   loss of   weapon
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          The Tata Nano factory gate in Singur after the project moved to Gujarat. File picture                                                    
	Calcutta, Dec. 9: Mamata Banerjee has been forcing the CPM on the defensive since the last Lok Sabha polls. For a change, the CPM now has thrown a googly at her by offering the Singur land to the railways to build a coach factory there.         
	The Railway Board has sent the state government a reply that avoids a firm commitment, leaving Mamata with two options.         
	She can reject the governments offer and, in doing so, can put up her own arguments.         
	The big argument, of course, is that she cannot even appear to lose her pro-farmer card  Singur being a potent political weapon that helped her dramatically change political equations in the state, said a Trinamul Congress general secretary.        
	Didi might think it politically impossible to reverse that stand and that too on an issue like Singur, he added.                Mamata      
	The other obvious argument for her to reject the states offer is her complete aversion to do business with the CPM  her partys recent boycott of all meetings with the state government shows how uncompromising her position is on this.        
	To support such arguments, she can always fall back on her position on unwilling farmers whose land was taken for the Tata Motors project in Singur, said a Trinamul source.        
	In fact, Partha Chatterjee, her partys leader in the Assembly, has already referred to this issue in his first reaction to the state governments offer yesterday.         
	That the Singur land is technically still with the Tatas is, however, a minor problem because the state can persuade them to return the land if the railways agree to build the coach factory there, said a government official.        
	The other option for Mamata is to use the states offer to her political advantage.         
	By accepting the states proposal, she can demolish the CPMs campaign against her supposedly anti-industry politics, said a former Trinamul MLA.        
	The coach factory in Singur will make a big difference that suits Mamatas political line. It will be a public sector venture, not a private sector one. She can thus take the wind out of the Lefts pro-public sector sail. By accepting the offer, our leader can turn the CPMs googly into a loose ball and hit the CPM back with it, the former legislator said.        
	According to a Congress general secretary, a railway coach factory in Singur could be her defining argument to prove that she can do what the CPM cannot. So, in one stroke, she can win the industrialisation argument and, at the same time, beat the CPM at its own game, the Congress leader said.        
	As for the unwilling farmers of Singur, things may change dramatically if Mamata accepts the CPMs challenge. According to them, many of the unwilling farmers, especially the pro-Trinamul section among them, may finally drop their opposition to land acquisition if the railway project materialises.        
	They may then be nursing hopes of getting jobs and other facilities from the railways, said a Trinamul leader.        
	However, what Mamata would eventually do may depend on whether she thinks she can afford to dilute the use of the pro-farmer card, said an activist close to the Trinamul leader.        
	The opposition by central minister and Trinamul leader Sisir Adhikari to the proposal for setting up a nuclear power plant at Haripur suggests the party still sets the highest score for its new-found farmer constituency, he said. But Singur is somewhat different. The land there is already acquired and industry there offers a mixed political challenge to Mamata, he added.        
	According to a state government official, Trinamuls argument that the coach factory can come up if 400 acres are returned to unwilling farmers wouldnt hold water as a Supreme Court verdict rules out that possibility.        
	The apex court verdict says that land taken for public purpose will have to be used for the same purpose by a government department. If that is not done, the government can auction off the land to the highest bidder. But in no way can the land be given back to the original owners, an official said.

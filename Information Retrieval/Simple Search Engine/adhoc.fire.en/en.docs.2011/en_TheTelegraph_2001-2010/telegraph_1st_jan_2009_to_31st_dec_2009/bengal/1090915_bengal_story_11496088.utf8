	New Delhi, Sept. 14: Twelve multi-function stations will come up by the middle of next year, including one each in Digha and Burdwan, railway minister Mamata Banerjee said in Delhi today.        
	The expert committee on railway land usage chaired by (Ficci secretary-general) Dr Amit Mitra has given its report suggesting various innovative ways to utilise railway land commercially. (It) has identified 64 stations to be developed as multi-function stations, Mamata said.        
	The surplus land with these stations will be used to provide facilities such as the Internet, healthcare, hotels and shopping arcades.         
	We have set a 180-day timeline for the first stage of 12 stations. Construction work will start by December, Mitra said.

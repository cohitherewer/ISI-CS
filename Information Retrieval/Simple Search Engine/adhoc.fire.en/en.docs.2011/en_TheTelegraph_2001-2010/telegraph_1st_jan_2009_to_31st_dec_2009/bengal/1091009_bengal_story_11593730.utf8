The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | North Bengal amp; Sikkim | Trinamul lines up protests
                                                   Trinamul lines up protests
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Siliguri, Oct. 8: The Trinamul Congress today said it would lay siege to the Siliguri-Jalpaiguri Development Authority and North Bengal University next month as part of an agitation programme to highlight the Left Fronts misrule in the region.        
	Gautam Deb, the partys Darjeeling district president, however, did not announce the dates for the agitation.        
	In the first week of November, we will gherao the SJDA office, demanding a white paper on its projects, including the Chandmoni tea estate and the Kawakhali township proposal, Deb told journalists.        
	The SJDA schemes were fraught with doubts and the CPM was secretive about them, the Trinamul leader said. We will demand more transparency in executing the projects, In the second week, the party will organise an NBU Abhijan, protesting against corruption in the varsity administration. The university has become a hotbed of nepotism where CPM ministers and their relatives have occupied the posts. This has to be rooted out, Deb said. Partha Chatterjee, the Opposition leader in the Assembly, will lead the movement.        
	Deb said they would send a letter to the civic commissioner in the next couple of days informing him of the partys decision to sit in the Opposition in the Siliguri Municipal Corporation.         
	Shankar Malakar, his counterpart in the district Congress, appeared keen to negotiate with Trinamul for the posts of deputy mayor, members of the mayor-in-council and borough chairmen. Doors are still open for discussion with Trinamul. We wont allow the CPM or anybody to take any advantage, he said.        
	Deb, however, ruled out any support to the Congress. There is no question of sitting with them in the civic board, he said.

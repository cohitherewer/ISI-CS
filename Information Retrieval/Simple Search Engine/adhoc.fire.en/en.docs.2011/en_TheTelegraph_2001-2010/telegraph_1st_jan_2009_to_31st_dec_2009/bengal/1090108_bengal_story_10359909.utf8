          OUR CORRESPONDENT                               
	Darjeeling, Jan. 7: The Gorkha Janmukti Morcha has decided to withdraw its hunger strikes in front of police stations across the hills this evening even as most government offices remained shut as part of the non-cooperation movement that was resumed today.         
	Like in the last phase, there were no Morcha picketers in town, but the state and the central government offices were deserted.         
	No untoward incident was reported. Those in the election office had reported for duty. A meeting to discuss culling operations in Pubong was also held, said Surendra Gupta, the district magistrate of Darjeeling.         
	Culling was expected to start at 4.30pm following the confirmation of the outbreak of bird flu in Pubong village in Rangli-Rungliot block, 45km from Darjeeling. Around 8,000 birds will be culled.         
	Morcha general secretary Roshan Giri said: We decided to lift the relay hunger strike to concentrate on our party activities, scheduled to start in the Dooars soon.         
	After Christmas break, the fast had resumed on January 2 to protest against alleged police atrocities when pro and anti-Gorkhaland supporters clashed at Kalchini last month.         
	The Morcha has already announced a five-day programme for the womens wing in various parts of the Dooars from January 15.         
	The Gorkha Janmukti Yuva Morcha, the youth wing of the party, had said earlier that about 1,400 youths would accompany the Nari Morcha members to the plains.         
	A 30-member team of the Yuva Morcha is currently in the Dooars to impress upon the students the need for a separate state.         
	Sources said a programme might be scheduled at Gorubathan on January 12, in which 5,000 Gorkhaland Personnel (GLP) are expected to attend. The Morcha has deferred its training camp for the GLP that was supposed to start today because of the activities it has lined up in the Dooars.

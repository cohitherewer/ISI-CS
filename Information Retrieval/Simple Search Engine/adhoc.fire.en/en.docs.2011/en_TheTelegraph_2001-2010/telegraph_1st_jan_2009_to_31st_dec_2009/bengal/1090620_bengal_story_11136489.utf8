The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Alert against Nandi replay
                                                                                                               Alert against Nandi replay
          A STAFF REPORTER                               
	Calcutta, June 19: The Bengal government today sent out a firm message to the central forces marching to Lalgarh with state police that they should not use mortar shells or open fire unless forced, to avoid loss of innocent lives.         
	Today the Maoists opened fire first, which prompted us to retaliate. But it was a long-distance exchange of fire where the chance of loss of life was considerably low. The government is very edgy about deaths of villagers, a senior officer of the state home department overseeing operations in Lalgarh said.         
	With the 14 deaths in police firing in Nandigram costing the CPM dear in the elections, the political bosses dont want a repeat in Lalgarh.         
	At Writers Buildings, the administration brass keeping an eye on Lalgarh sent an SOS to the operation bosses on the ground asking them to be cautious as soon as news of gunshots trickled in.        
	The government doesnt want to face any uncomfortable situation that might arise with activists rallying with the body of an innocent victim, said a senior officer. We have told the top brass in Lalgarh the forces and the police should be very considerate while arresting demonstrators, he added.         
	Accordingly, the police released a few women arrested as part of a large gang that had set up a road blockade in Goaltore in the evening. The police also took a few local residents, who were drunk, to health centres for a check-up.        
	Since Operation Lalgarh will be protracted battle, the forces will not hurry towards the core Maoist area, the officer said. It has been decided that the CRPF and the BSF forces would move at a steady pace  taking areas, setting up permanent camps and collecting intelligence with the help of state police before proceeding further.         
	Chief secretary Asok Mohan Chakrabarti said the state had received six companies of the BSF, of which three have been deployed and the rest kept in reserve. More central forces have been sought.         
	Home secretary Ardhendu Sen said: We have asked for extra forces. I cant say when they will be deployed.

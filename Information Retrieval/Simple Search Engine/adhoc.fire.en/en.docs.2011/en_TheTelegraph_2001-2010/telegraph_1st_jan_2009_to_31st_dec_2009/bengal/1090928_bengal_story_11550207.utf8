The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Brief rain pain and then relief
                                                                                                               Brief rain pain and then relief

	Calcutta, Sept. 27: The rain demon that was teasing this puja struck on Mahanavami but retreated after an hour, bringing relief from heat to pandal-hoppers.        
	The rain caused the collapse of a podium outside the Babubagan Sarbojonin, near Dhakuria, around 7.35pm and some pandal-hoppers suffered minor injuries. A police team arrived at the spot and visitors entry was restricted for around two hours.         
	The thundershower lasted from 7.30pm to 8.30pm. The spell of thundershower brought heavy rain (16.8mm till 8.30pm) but for barely an hour. Its quite normal during this time of the year and well in line with our forecast of possible scattered thundershowers, said an official of the Regional Meteorological Centre at Alipore.        
	Mahadashami will be generally cloudy with one or two spells of rain or thundershower, the weather official added. Temperatures are likely to range between 27 degrees Celsius and 33 degrees Celsius.        
	My friends and I had to take shelter in a pandal at Rajballabh Para for over 45 minutes because of the rain. We will continue anyway because its the last day of the puja, said Soumi Roy, 23, a techie from south Calcutta.        
	Around 8.45pm, puja organisers at College Square were busy cleaning the park that had become muddy. We are trying our best to clean up the mess. Obviously, because of the rain, the number of people is fewer than what is expected on the last day of the puja, said Bikash Majumdar, one of the organisers at College Square.        
	However, soon after the rain ended, people started pouring out again. Initial estimates suggested around 20 lakh people took to the streets, nearly twice the number on other days this puja.        
	The cooling effect of the shower helped, too. The rain may have inconvenienced most pandal-hoppers and organisers while it lasted, but it pushed up the comfort level. I hope the rest of the night will also be cool, an official said.        
	Samrat Dutta, 27, a pandal-hopper, agreed. The comfort factor improved during the shower.        
	The sudden spell of rain affected traffic movement across the city. Vehicles came to a standstill near the New Alipore petrol pump. It was difficult for those in the queue to get out. So, we tried to provide umbrellas, said Bhaskar Das, the vice-president of Suruchi Sangha.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Bengal mulls ban on Maoists
                                                                                                               Bengal mulls ban on Maoists
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                           A Peoples Committee supporter in Pathardanga, Lalgarh. (Sanat Kumar Sinha)                                  
	New Delhi, June 20: The Bengal government is giving serious thought to the Centres suggestion about banning Maoists, Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee said today.         
	Home minister Chidambaram advised me to ban this organisation. We have to give it serious thought, the chief minister said after meeting Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and P. Chidambaram.         
	Asked why the state had not thought of it before, Bhattacharjee said: Now we have started thinking what to do.         
	Chidambaram had yesterday said the CPI (Maoist) should be banned in West Bengal as in other states.         
	State CPM secretary Biman Bose, in Delhi for a two-day party central committee meeting that began today, said: It (banning the Maoists) is not just a question of our party. It is a matter for the Left Front government. All Left parties will have to take a view on it.         
	Asked about the CPMs view, he said the matter was not on the agenda of the ongoing meeting.        
	Bhattacharjee said the home minister had assured him of more troops if the state government required them.        
	Bengal has already been given 13 companies of the CRPF and six companies of the BSF. Each company has around 100 personnel.        
	The central forces are working together with state police and paramilitary against the Maoists in Lalgarh, the chief minister said.         
	Asked whether the guerrillas were running a parallel government around 200km from Calcutta, he said: I have no answer to this.         
	According to him, of the 241 blocks in Bengal, 18 are fully or partially disturbed.         
	Bhattacharjee accused the Maoists of killing innocent citizens and engaging in extortion and other crimes.         
	He was happy over the Centres prompt response in sending the paramilitary to the state. The first column of central forces has reached there, he said. It will take some time to get rid of the Maoist menace and we will continue the campaign.        
	The CPM central committee called on party units all over the country to launch a powerful campaign in solidarity with comrades in West Bengal and against the politics of terror unleashed by (the) Trinamul-led alliance as well as against the Maoist gangs.        
	In the statement, it also appealed to citizens across the country to raise their voice against such terror-based politics.

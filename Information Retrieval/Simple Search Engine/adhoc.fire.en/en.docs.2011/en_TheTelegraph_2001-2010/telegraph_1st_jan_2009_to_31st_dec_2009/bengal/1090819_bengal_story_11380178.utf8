The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Ally attack for Delhi vacuum
                                                                                                               Ally attack for Delhi vacuum
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Calcutta, Aug. 18: The CPMs allies today said a minister should have been deputed to lead the Bengal delegation to Delhi for the chief ministers conclave when Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee failed to make it because of illness.        
	The state chief secretary and home secretary had attended yesterdays meeting to discuss internal security and rain scarcity, but they were only allowed to table Bengals views, not read them out.         
	Even at Sundays Left Front meeting we were told the chief minister would attend the Delhi session with the Prime Minister. He couldnt do so because of his illness. But he should have deputed another minister for the meeting instead of sending bureaucrats, said PWD minister Kshiti Goswami, who is from the RSP.         
	It showed us in poor light and sent a wrong message across the country, he added.        
	CPI state secretary Manjukumar Mazumdar said: After all, a meeting convened by the Prime Minister assumes national importance.        
	Agriculture minister Naren De, of the Forward Bloc, echoed the other partners.         
	On his return from Delhi, home secretary Ardhendu Sen today said the chief minister could not depute a minister because he had wanted to attend the meeting till the last moment.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Lalgarh charge
                                                                                                               Lalgarh charge
                            
	Calcutta, April 25: Police are going to lodge a complaint against the Lalgarh tribals and their supporters who choked the heart of Calcutta last evening for allegedly assaulting a traffic sergeant. The tribals had blocked Theatre Road and Chowringhee for almost five hours after accusing a cop of demanding a bribe from one of their drivers and thrashing him.

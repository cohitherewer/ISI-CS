The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Blame on people for cop kidnap
                                                                                                               Blame on people for cop kidnap
          OUR BUREAU                          Missing cop Sabirs mother Jahanara. (Niladri Sekhar Sarkar)                                  
	Aug. 4: The Maoists today hinted that all may not be well with the two policemen who have been missing in Lalgarh for the past five days.        
	CPI (Maoist) leader Bikash told The Telegraph: We are not responsible for what may have happened to the two. They have received the peoples justice. They have been tried in a peoples court and they have received the justice that the court awarded.        
	Constables Sabir Mollah, 30, and Kanchan Gorai, 26, went missing last Thursday after they left Lalgarh town for a camp 10km away.        
	Senior police officers said the Maoists probably did not admit kidnapping the two for fear of losing the sympathy of common people.         
	A few days ago they (the Maoists) had said that policemen in the lower levels were not their enemies. So, they are scared of owning up to the fact of kidnapping the two policemen, West Midnapore superintendent Manoj Verma said.         
	Earlier, there have been instances of villagers coming out and surrounding raiding parties. But over the past month, the joint forces or the police have raided 150 villages without being obstructed. This proves the Maoists popularity is on the wane, he added,         
	The SP said they had specific information that the constables were kidnapped jointly by the Maoists and members of the Peoples Committee Against Police Atrocities.         
	The Maoists are making a false claim that they were not involved in the kidnapping. We know who abducted the constables but we dont want to identify them now. This much I can say, we are making an all-out effort to find the two, said Verma.        
	The two families are worried no end. At Telsara village in Burdwans Memari, Sabirs mother Jahanara Bewa, 61, has virtually not eaten anything for the past five days.         
	I spoke to my son last Wednesday. He promised to visit me in a few days. Then we came to know about the kidnapping from television. I dont know where my son is. Will God be so cruel as to snatch him from me? asked Jahanara, breaking down.        
	Sabir is the youngest of four brothers. The first two are farmers while the third works in an embroidery shop.        
	He got his job in 2006. Whenever we ask the police about him, they say aamra dekhchhi (we are looking into it), said Sarif, his elder brother.         
	At Suarabokra village near Bankuras Chhatna (70km from Lalgarh), the Gorais are spending sleepless nights. Kanchan, the youngest of three brothers, is the bright star in the poor farmer family and the only one with a steady income.         
	He used to phone us every day from wherever he was. When he didnt call on Thursday, I knew something was wrong. The next day, we read in the papers that he had been abducted. Since then, I have been calling his commandant everyday, said Basudeb Gorai, Kanchans 70-year-old father.

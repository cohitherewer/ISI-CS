The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Biman returns PM-DM fire
                                                                                                               Biman returns PM-DM fire
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Calcutta, May 31: Biman Bose today hit back at Mamata Banerjees PM-to-DM statement, saying minus the CM there could not be aid distribution to cyclone victims.        
	Ours is a federal government and central funds should be routed through the chief minister to district magistrates. The stand on PM to DM minus CM is untenable, the CPM state secretary said in Midnapore. If attempts are made to do anything bypassing the state government, we shall not accept it.        
	Asked about aid disbursal to Aila victims after a meeting with the Prime Minister, Mamata had yesterday said: Rajiv Gandhi had coined the phrase PM-to-DM. I told (the Prime Minister) it can be altered a bit to make it PM to gram panchayats....        
	Mamata today repeated the demand adding that the rural bodies are acquainted with the ground-level situation.         
	Pointing out that the government had not been able to provide drinking water to the cyclone-affected people in the Sunderbans, Mamata asked: How can you rely on this government?        
	Trinamul MP Kalyan Banerjee, a lawyer, said there was nothing unconstitutional in central aid going straight to district magistrates, zilla parishads and panchayats.         
	There is no provision in our Constitution that central assistance cannot be sent straight to district magistrates, zilla parishads and panchayats, he said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Mamata bets on Cong govt
                                                                                                               Mamata bets on Cong govt
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Mamata Banerjee at a rally on Sunday. (Amit Datta)                                  
	Calcutta, May 10: Mamata Banerjee today expressed confidence that the question of taking Left support will not arise for the Congress despite the partys hints that it might have to do so.        
	Im optimistic the Congress would form the government on its own and we shall back it, come what may. The question of taking Left support will not arise, the Trinamul Congress chief said.        
	The alliance with the Congress will remain intact, she told a meet-the-press programme, adding that she did not expect the Left to emerge as a force to reckon with.        
	Barring three to four seats in Kerala, the Left will draw a blank both in Bengal and Tripura this time.        
	Asked about Rahul Gan-dhis statement that the Left would back a Congress-led government and Manmohan Singh as Prime Minister, Mamata said: Rahul is a young boy and his statements were distorted by the media. He didnt categorically say the Congress would take Left support.         
	A day after Rahul had made the statement, party gene- ral secretary K. Keshava Rao called Mamata to clarify that he had not spoken categorically about taking Left support. Bengal Congress chief Pranab Mukherjee told her it was a premature proposition.        
	Mamata denied reports that Sonia Gandhi and Rahul had not campaigned in Bengal for the May 13 polls keeping in mind a possible post-election alliance with the Left. I had shared a platform with Soniaji in Jangipur on April 27. Rahul had also come. I dont mind if they couldnt turn up this time because of security reasons or engagements elsewhere.        
	The Trinamul chief add-ressed rallies with Mukherjee tonight.        
	She iterated her claim that the CPM had fielded dummy candidate Saifuddin Chowdhury in Jadavpur to cut into the votes of Trinamuls Kabir Suman. Safida had never participated in (the) Singur agitation. Hed backed the Tatas in Singur, she added.        
	Trinamul state president Subrata Bakshi said the party would also fight next years civic polls with the Congress.

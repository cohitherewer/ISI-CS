The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Bandhs off, with a tea stricture
                                                                                                               Bandhs off, with a tea stricture
  - Gurung wants Gorkhaland   mark on packets         OUR BUREAU                           Houses of Morcha supporters burn in Jalpaiguri. Kundan Yolmo                                              
	Jan. 17: The Gorkha Janmukti Morcha today lifted its hill bandh but not before party chief Bimal Gurung said every packet of Darjeeling Tea would have to carry a Gorkhaland label.        
	The Akhil Bharatiya Adivasi Vikas Parishad, which had called a Dooars strike yesterday, also lifted the bandh but after several clashes with Morcha activists.         
	At Nagrakata, an area in the Dooars in Jalpaiguri district, thousands of tribal activists of the Adivasi outfit set fire to five houses, all of alleged Morcha supporters, and a shop at Chadar Line in Jalpaiguri town. The Morcha supporters managed to flee.         
	A motorcycle and a Maruti van were also set ablaze. Police had to burst tear gas shells to disperse the tribals.         
	In Banarhat, also in the Dooars, Morcha supporter Chetan Rai was hit by an arrow. His bike too was set on fire.        
	Morcha activists, assembled at Salugara on the outskirts of Siliguri, torched three autorickshaws on NH-31 because the vehicles were running despite the bandh being in force. One driver was hurt.         
	The attack on the autorickshaws later sparked a clash between the Morcha and the DYFI. Both sides hurled bricks at each other, prompting the police to burst tear gas shells again.         
	Gurungs diktat to put the Gorkhaland mark on every packet of Darjeeling Tea came at a public meeting in Gorubathan, Kalimpong, which is near the Dooars. From now on, each packet of Darjeeling Tea should carry the mark of Gorkhaland before moving out (of the hills), he said.         
	We have, so far, taken the path of non-violence as advocated by Gandhiji. But considering the state of affairs, we would not think twice to take the path of Subhas Chandra Bose, he added.         
	We have designated the Nari Morcha (the womens front) to open counters in the tea estates of the hills and ensure that no revenue flows out too, he added.        
	Yesterday, over 100 people were injured when Morcha activists clashed with supporters of the Adivasi outfit, which is against a separate Gorkhaland.         
	The Adivasi outfit then called the bandh in the Dooars. The Morcha called a strike in the hills.        
	Home secretary Ardhendu Sen said in Calcutta that the government was keeping a close watch on north Bengal.

          OUR BUREAU                          The wooden box at Sankrail police station from which the Maoists took away the revolvers. (Samir Mondal)                                  
	Calcutta, Oct. 20: The Maoists had chosen todays target with care.         
	The poorly armed Sankrail police station is outside the Lalgarh arena of action and near the borders with Jharkhand and Orissa.        
	According to a senior officer posted there until recently, the police station was both topographically and circumstantially vulnerable.         
	Modern weapons had been withdrawn from the personnel at the police station following fears that they could be snatched by the Maoists.         
	Automatic weapons were provided only during elections and some of the Sankrail personnel had been living in perpetual fear, aware that they did not have the firepower to match the Maoists.         
	It is only recently that the Maoists have started killing and kidnapping while snatching arms from policemen, the officer said, suggesting the force may not have been prepared for the rebels change of tack.        
	The location also suited the Maoists. The escape routes (to Jharkhand and Orissa) are easy and well covered and reaching the border takes little time, the officer said.        
	More important, the Maoists knew that Sankrail, though in Jhargram subdivision, was outside the Lalgarh zone, where the Centre and the states paramilitary forces were conducting a joint operation.         
	With the police station located outside a typical Maoist-hit zone, the districts top cops never considered throwing a security ring around it. There are no bunkers. The gates are manned by sentries with ordinary .303 rifles, a senior West Midnapore officer said.        
	Local support was a factor, too. The extremists have the support of local people, tacit or active. Anti-police feelings have grown again after the arrest of Chhatradhar Mahato, an officer said.        
	But todays raid, intelligence sources said, was meant more to be a signal to the joint forces than a protest against Mahatos arrest.         
	The timing of the afternoon assault also caught the cops off guard. At 1.30pm, the place becomes desolate, with the shops closed and residents asleep. Having done night duty, most of the policemen also take rest. The few people around are in the bank next door, the officer said.        
	City arrest        
	The general secretary of the Bandi Mukti Committee, Chhoton Das, was arrested late tonight from Beleghata in Calcutta for alleged Maoist links.

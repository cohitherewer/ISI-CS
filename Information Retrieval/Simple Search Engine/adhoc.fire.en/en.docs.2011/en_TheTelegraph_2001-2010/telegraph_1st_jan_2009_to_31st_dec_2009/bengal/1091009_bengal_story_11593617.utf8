The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | North Bengal amp; Sikkim | Malda flooded, bridge snaps
                                                   Malda flooded, bridge snaps
          OUR BUREAU                          The damaged bridge over the Sudani. (Nantu Dey)                                  
	Oct. 8: More than 25,000 people have been affected by widespread waterlogging in Maldas Englishbazar municipality area as rain lashed the region last night. In North Dinajpurs Domohona, 150km away, concrete slabs of a makeshift bridge collapsed this morning, stopping traffic for more than five hours on NH34.        
	With no power or drinking water in as many as eight wards in Malda, angry residents set up a road blockade at Kanimore. The Congress MLA of Englishbazar Krishnendu Chowdhury had to face the anger of the protesters when he visited the area.        
	We are confined to our homes. Water has flooded many houses in wards 20, 21 and 23. We tried calling up the municipality but no one answered us. The chairman and the vice-chairman were not available and the commissioner of Ward 21, the CPMs Prabhat Acharya, is touring China, a protester said.        
	Chowdhury, a former municipal chairman, expressed anger at the way the current civic body run by the Congress-Trinamul Congress-BJP combine was functioning. I am also looking for the chairman and the vice chairman. I have been told that both of them are out of the district. I fail to understand how this civic body is functioning, Chowdhury said.        
	Areas like Subhaspalli, Prantapalli, Sarbamangalapalli and Vidyasagarpalli have been inundated. There is waist-deep water in many areas.        
	Sources in the district irrigation department said there had been 152.5mm rain in the district in the past 24 hours.        
	At Domohona, a single file traffic was allowed from 11am after a stopgap repair carried out by the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) on the bridge over the Sudani. Normal traffic resumed at 5.30pm.        
	Divisional project director of the NHAI Goutam Dutta said repair started soon after information of the cave-in of two concrete slabs on the bridge that connects south and north Bengal had reached them a little after 7am.        
	When the Bailey bridge over the Sudani collapsed on August 22, 2007, the army built a 40-metre long temporary structure on an emergency basis by erecting 20 concrete slabs on iron pillars.        
	 But before the slabs could be joined properly, we had to open it to traffic at the request of the district administration. Many drivers did not maintain the speed limit we had stipulated, Dutta said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Morcha lifts strike 
                                                                                                               Morcha lifts strike 
          VIVEK CHHETRI                       Bimal Gurung                          
	Darjeeling, July 27: Bimal Gurung withdrew the Gorkha Janmukti Morchas indefinite strike from tomorrow and dared policemen to resign from service for the cause of statehood.         
	The Morcha chief made the announcement for ending the strike at Chowrasta while observing Martyrs Day in memory of 1,200 people who died during a 28-month statehood agitation under the GNLF in the eighties. In 1986, on this day, 14 people were gunned down by paramilitary forces in Kalimpong.        
	Gurung cited the talks with the Centre as the reason for the withdrawal. In an attempt to create a congenial atmosphere for the August 11 tripartite meeting, we decided to withdraw the strike from tomorrow. We will review the outcome of the talks at a meeting on August 17 when we decide on the future of the agitation, he said.         
	He, however, asked people to continue boycotting payment of all government taxes.         
	The party had earlier linked the withdrawal of the strike, which started on July 13, to the transfer of senior police officers from the hills. Today, Gurung said: We must not be one-track in our approach.         
	Then quickly he clarified: I am not withdrawing the strike fearing that my people will go hungry. I have enough rations stocked for three months and it will be my duty to distribute them to every house.        
	The Morcha leader then challenged the hill police to show their commitment to the statehood cause.        
	In the plains, even a constable is determined to stop the partition of Bengal but policemen (from the Gorkha community) here are arresting our own people. If you are committed to the cause (of Gorkhaland), I dare you to resign, said Gurung.

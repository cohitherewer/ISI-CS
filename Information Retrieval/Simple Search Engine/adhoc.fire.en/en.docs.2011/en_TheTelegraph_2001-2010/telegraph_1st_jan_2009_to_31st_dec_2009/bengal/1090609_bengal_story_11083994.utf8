                                                                                                               No-job youth dead
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Burdwan, June 8: A 31-year-old holding a certificate from one of the teachers training institutes declared illegal by Calcutta High Court last year hanged himself over the weekend, fed up with his joblessness.        
	Somnath Majumdar, who completed the course with a first class in 2003 and was empanelled for a job in 2006, was found hanging at his home at Panchghora village in Burdwans Katwa, about 160km from Calcutta, early on Sunday.         
	His is the tenth suicide in 15 months by students of the institutes declared illegal last October. Some suicides took place before the court order, though, as many of the degree-holders had grown frustrated waiting for a job.        
	Somnaths case highlights the problems that have come to haunt those students who were empanelled  shortlisted  for being appointed while their degrees were still valid, but whose fates were sealed when the court said their qualifications were illegal.        
	The court order, covering all 138 institutes in the state, jeopardised the career of nearly 75,000 candidates who were either studying or already had the certificates.         
	The institutes had been running without the mandatory approval of the National Council for Technical Education and some of the basic facilities required in such schools.        
	Somnath was very depressed. I had told him to pursue other professions. I never imagined he would end his life, said his father Mahadeb. The 61-year-old himself retired as headmaster of a Katwa school in December 2008.        
	Somnath had passed out of an institute at Vidyanagar in Purbasthali, about 170km from Calcutta, where he took admission after graduating with Bengali honours from Katwa College.        
	Ashok Rudra, a leader of the aggrieved students, confirmed that Somnaths was the tenth suicide. We shall submit a memorandum to school education minister Partha De highlighting our plight, he said.

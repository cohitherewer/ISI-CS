                                                                                                               CPM guns for Lalgarh ministers
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                               
	New Delhi, July 29: The CPM today demanded central action against two Trinamul Congress ministers who went to Lalgarh yesterday, charging them with inciting violence and speaking against the paramilitary operating in the area.         
	At a time joint operations to contain Maoist violence are on, they visited the area yesterday, incited violence and provoked confrontation with security forces, thereby giving sustenance to Maoist violence and endangering the unity and integrity of the country, CPM politburo member Sitaram Yechury said.         
	In Lalgarh, junior rural development minister Sisir Adhikari and junior shipping minister Mukul Roy had demanded withdrawal of the security forces.        
	The leader of the CPM in the Lok Sabha, Basudev Acharya, said the cabinet committee on security had decided to send the forces. How can ministers speak against a decision of the cabinet? Isnt it the collective responsibility of the ministers?         
	Acharya and Yechury demanded that the Centre clarify why the two ministers were allowed to visit the area and take necessary action.

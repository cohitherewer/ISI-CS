The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | HC order on student right to scan script
                                                                                                               HC order on student right to scan script
          OUR LEGAL CORRESPONDENT                          Exams: Not the end anymore                                  
	Calcutta, Feb. 5: Students have the right to take a look at their answer scripts if they are dissatisfied with their marks in major examinations.        
	A division bench of the Calcutta High Court on Thursday went by the judgement of Justice Sanjib Banerjee of the same court and held that agencies conducting exams are bound to show the answer script if an examinee demands it under the Right to Information (RTI) Act, 2005.        
	All agencies from Calcutta University to ICSE/CBSE and various school authorities will come under the purview of the order.        
	The division bench of Chief Justice S.S. Nijjar and Justice Dipankar Dutta in their 50-page ruling said: The examination conducting agencies will have to show the answer scripts to the candidates within four weeks of their filing the application under Right to Information Act.        
	According to Article 19 of the Constitution, examinees must have access to evaluated answer scripts...Denial of inspection of answer scripts means the constitutional right to express and information may be lost, the division bench observed, upholding Justice Banerjees verdict.        
	The ruling followed an appeal by Calcutta University against Justice Banerjees order and five other writ petitions, three by the Madhyamik board. The appeal and petitions were heard by the division bench analogously.        
	Early last year, a Part II student of mathematics honours in Presidency College, Pritam Rooj, had moved a writ before Justice Banerjee against Calcutta Universitys decision not to show him an answer script.        
	Appearing for Rooj, his counsel had claimed that following the enactment of the RTI Act, the university authorities were bound to show the answer script to his client. Justice Banerjee, on March 28, 2008, had allowed Roojs petition and asked the university authorities to show him the answer script.        
	Armed with Justice Banerjees judgement, many Madhyamik 2008 examinees had approached the RTI commission seeking an order demanding a look at their answer scripts.        
	When the RTI commission had asked the Board of Secondary Education to show the answer scripts to the aggrieved students, it had moved a writ petition before the high court against the commissions order.

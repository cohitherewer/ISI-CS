The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Dream to cure cancer cut short
                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      Dream to cure cancer cut short
          TAMAGHNA BANERJEE                                                    Partha Bag and the Namkhana school where he studied till Class XII      
	Namkhana (South 24-Parganas), Dec. 30: The first thing Partha Bags father Debaprasad did after hearing on television about the fire in the Bhabha Atomic Research Centre was reach for his phone.        
	The call to Parthas cell went unanswered.        
	What Debaprasad didnt know was that his son, a 26-year-old research scholar at Barc, had been charred to death by then.        
	With Partha not responding, Debaprasad called up his sons friend, also a research scholar at Barc, only to be told that he was attending a project in Kharagpur.        
	Seeing how worried her husband was, Parthas mother hurried over to him, but all that they could do was wait for a call that would give them some news of their son.        
	That call came at 5.15 last evening, when the Barc director told the family that one of the two men charred beyond recognition in the lab had Parthas identity card on him.        
	Such was the condition of the body that it was handed over to the family only after a DNA test. Even we cant recognise him, sobbed sister Piyali, who reached Trombay with her parents this afternoon.         
	They had left Namkhana, 105km from Calcutta, at 3.15 this morning.        
	This is such a sad end to the brightest boy of Nam- khana, said Amitabha Manna, Parthas biology teacher at Namkhana Narayan Vidya- mandir School, from where he passed his higher secondary exams in 2000.        
	Manna said Parthas ambition had been to become a scientist and discover a cure for cancer. This is what he was pursuing in Barc, Manna said. And this was what he had wanted to do ever since he completed school.        
	The school topper went on to do his graduation in genetics from Bangalore and masters in medical biochemistry from Mangalore.         
	After his MSc, he came back and worked first at SSKM Hospital and then at Bose Institute before moving to Barc in 2008, said cousin Atindranath Hazra.        
	He was very talented, said Sashanka Chakraborty, the head of biochemistry at SSKM under whom Partha had trained. He worked as a research scholar in the pathology department and also did research on natural products. He was excited about his work.         
	His father had kept him away from the familys ice bu-siness so he could pursue his studies. Everything has come to nought, said Amal Maity, a relative.        
	The family of the other victim, Umang Singh, 25, demanded a CBI probe.         
	There used to be a number of researchers along with Umang. Why were only two of them there yesterday? What was the exact cause of the fire? It is a matter of national security, and thats why we are demanding a CBI probe, his uncle Munna Singh said from the morgue at JJ Hospital.         
	Umang was a former mill workers son whose monthly stipend of Rs 14,000 was the only income the family had. He had two older sisters.        
	Brother-in-law Uday Pratap said Umang had been working with Barc for four-and-a-half years and was barely six months away from completing his PhD.         
	A friend alleged that Umang had suffered a burn last week while working in the same lab. He had doused the fire and escaped with a minor injury to his right hand, said Jairam Gholave, who is doing his PhD in chemistry from Mumbai University.         
	Umang had apparently told him that he respected Barc as an institution and did not wish to create an issue.        
	Police have registered a case of accidental fire. Samples from the lab have been sent to the Central Forensic Science Laboratory.         
	It would not be proper to comment on the probe (now), said an atomic energy department spokesperson.

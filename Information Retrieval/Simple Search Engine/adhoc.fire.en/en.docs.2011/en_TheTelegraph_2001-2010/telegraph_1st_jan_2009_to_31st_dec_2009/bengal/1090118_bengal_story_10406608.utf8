The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Land for industry on minister lips
                                                                                                               Land for industry on minister lips
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Calcutta, Jan. 17: Political parties should come out of their narrow mindset on land acquisition and aid economic development, Pranab Mukherjee today told a state chamber of commerce but without naming any outfit or leader.        
	An atmosphere has been created across the country against acquisition of land. But industry, roads, railway tracks and ports cannot be built in the sky. It has to come up on land, the external affairs minister said at the annual general meeting of Bharat Chamber of Commerce in Calcutta.         
	Mukherjee did not mention Trinamul Congress chief Mamata Banerjee or the agitation she led in Nandigram and Singur.        
	He said political parties, whether ruling or in the Opposition, should play a positive role towards industrialisation and the countrys economic development.        
	The Opposition today may become the ruling party tomorrow. They (Opposition) think when they come to power, they will solve everything using a magic wand. From my little experience, I can say that is not possible. We should not say anything that should make us eat our own words when we come to power, Mukherjee said.        
	The Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee government has a positive approach towards industry, he added.        
	Mukherjee said vested interests of some political outfits sometimes blocked development and cited the stalled expansion of National Highway 34. The Prime Minister had ordered the widening of NH-34, but because of some vested interests, even a survey could not be conducted, he said.

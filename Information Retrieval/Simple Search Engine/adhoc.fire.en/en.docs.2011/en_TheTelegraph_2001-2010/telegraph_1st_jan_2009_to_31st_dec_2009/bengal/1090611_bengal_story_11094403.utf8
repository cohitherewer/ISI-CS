The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | PM fair play message to Mamata 
                                                                                                               PM fair play message to Mamata 
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                             Manmohan, Mamata                                 
	New Delhi, June 10: Prime Minister Manmohan Singh has laid down a whole new code of conduct for his team stressing allegiance to assigned tasks, alert responsiveness and respect to dissent and debate.         
	Striking an almost Nehruvian vein, Singh has written to his council of ministers: Our parliamentary traditions are constantly evolving and we are setting new benchmarks in our democratic enterprise. Work related to Parliament and the committees of Parliament should receive your undivided attention so that the aspirations of our people are brought to bear on governance through their elected representatives. You may also like to ensure that requests of members of Parliament for appointment are attended to on priority basis and their letters replied to quickly.         
	In what may appear a tangential rejection of Trinamul leader Mamata Banerjees demand that central aid for cyclone relief should bypass the state government, Singh wrote: We have been objective and fair in dealing with the genuine concerns of all state governments. Let me urge you to ensure that all requests made by state chief ministers and ministers are responded to quickly and effectively.         
	The Centre is yet to firm up its own assessment of the quantum of aid Bengal requires for cyclone relief, but indications emerging from the Prime Ministers Office are that it is averse to be seen as playing politics with relief funds.         
	The full text of the Prime Ministers letter to colleagues, reported by The Telegraph last week, was released today.         
	Other than aligning colleagues to the challenges of enhancing performance on all flagship programmes, one of the points the Prime Minister has sharply made is to warn them against political arrogance or intolerance.         
	Our government in the last five years has been noted for its bipartisan approach on development issues. Respect for dissent and argument is the essence of our culture. I do not have to labour the point that we must give due consideration to the views of the Opposition and seek to work together for the collective well-being of our people, he wrote.        
	Singh said the views of civil society groups and panchayati raj institutions should be given an appropriate role in the formulation and implementation of development schemes.         
	As if to remind colleagues again that they were under watch on sticking to the new work ethic and he was boss, Singh said: Let me take this opportunity to remind you that matters that require the views or concurrence of other ministries or involve unbudgeted financial outlays ought not be made public without due consultation. The collective responsibility of the Cabinet enjoins us to do so. Needless to say, in case you have urgent problems or you consider it necessary to make any policy announcements you can always take them up with me.         
	Reminding ministers that loopholes in critical social sector programmes needed to be plugged and targets speedily achieved, the Prime Minister said that his Principal Secretary, T.K.A. Nair, was being tasked with following up on progress with all promises that carry a 100-day time-frame.         
	Stating that commitment to concerns of the aam aadmi and disadvantaged groups was the mandated responsibility of the UPA government, the Prime Minister said:  The people of this country have endorsed our efforts to create an inclusive society and an inclusive economy. The flagship programmes that we put in place to translate this vision of inclusion into reality need to be consolidated. We have to ensure that these flagship programmes confer appropriate benefit on disadvantaged groups particularly scheduled castes, scheduled tribes, minorities, women and children. The empowerment of women is central to our agenda. I would urge those of you, who are looking after flagship programmes, to address the task of plugging leakages in the operation of these programmes with single-minded devotion. He also asked ministers to respect the functional autonomy of public sector undertakings under their watch.

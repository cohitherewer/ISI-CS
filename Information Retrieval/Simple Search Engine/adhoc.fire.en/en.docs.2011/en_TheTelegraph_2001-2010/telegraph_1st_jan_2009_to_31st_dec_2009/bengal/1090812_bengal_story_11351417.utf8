          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Midnapore, Aug. 11: Chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee today said the security operation in Lalgarh would continue but possibly with a revised strategy.        
	Nineteen people have been killed in the region in the past month, though around 5,000 personnel are stationed there. Days after the forces completed their area domination exercises in end-June, Maoists claimed their first victim in the renewed spell of violence. The latest was last night.        
	The joint forces will stay and they will have to change their strategy, the chief minister told reporters when asked about the killing spree after a meeting with West Midnapore officials to review development work in the district.        
	The chief minister, here for the first time since the blast triggered by Maoists on his route last November, added that development projects had to be speeded up along with the security crackdown to isolate the rebels.        
	Although the joint forces comprising central and state paramilitary have completed area domination, they did not go deep into forests such as Jhitka, Kalaimuri, Kalshibhanga or Benishole. No Maoist leader has been arrested during the operation.        
	The state government has admitted that phase two of operation Lalgarh has failed. Almost everyday, Maoists are killing or abducting people. Our target was to arrest the Maoists or flush them out of Lalgarh and adjoining areas. But current incidents show there hasnt been any improvement, home secretary Ardhendu Sen said last week.        
	The chief minister met MLAs and MPs from the dist- rict, but refused to discuss Lalgarh. Jharkhand Party (Naren) MLA Chunibala Hansda quoted him as saying he would discuss the unrest with Delhi.         
	The Maoists have shot dead six of Hansdas partymen in the past 10 days, apparently to stamp their authority on the region.        
	Maoist leader Bikash said: The government will now try to create more terror in the name of new strategy. But the people of Lalgarh will fight back with arms.         
	Two Congress MLAs also attended the chief ministers meeting. They discussed irrigation and erosion.         
	Bhattacharjee inaugurated a college in Debra, 30km from the town. Referring to the practice of setting up police camps in schools and colleges, which has triggered fresh unrest in Lalgarh, he said: I told officers I would rather not go to Debra if my visit leads to the setting up of a police camp. No camp should be set up in a school. Several schools in Lalgarh, however, are still occupied by the forces.        
	The Peoples Committee Against Police Atrocities tonight called an indefinite bandh in West Midnapore, Bankura and Purulia demanding withdrawal of the forces from the schools in Lalgarh.

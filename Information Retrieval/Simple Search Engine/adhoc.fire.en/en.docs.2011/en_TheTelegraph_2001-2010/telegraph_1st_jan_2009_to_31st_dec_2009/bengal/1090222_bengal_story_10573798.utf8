The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Crisis culprit US, rails Buddha
                                                                                                               Crisis culprit US, rails Buddha
  - Praise for China in poll season          SAMBIT SAHA                          Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee in Durgapur. (Pradip Sanyal)                                  
	Durgapur, Feb. 21: Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee today blamed the US, the Lefts favourite target, blaming it for sinking the world economy along with its own.         
	The words of the chief minister, a proponent of globalisation that is synonymous with America, were perhaps timed keeping in mind the approaching Lok Sabha election.         
	Shara duniya jure ek talmatal obostha. Nater guru hochchhe America. Emon ekta desh, nijeo dubchhe, onyoder niyeo dubchhe (The world is in the middle of a crisis. The culprit is America. Not only is it sinking, it is drowning others with it), he said in Durgapur while opening an alloy and stainless steel unit of the Jai Balaji Industry.        
	I repeatedly tell our Delhi government do not hold Americas hand. They are big, we are small. We will die if we go with them. India, he said, should extricate itself from Americas grip.        
	Bhattacharjee lauded the Lefts role in protecting the country from the severity of the economic meltdown being witnessed in the US and Europe.         
	The Left had blocked higher foreign investment in the banking and insurance sectors and thereby protected the economy from crumbling, he said. Some people advise (us) to follow America. But they themselves dont know which path to take, Bhattacharjee, who inaugurated a hospital in the town, said.        
	His praise was reserved for communist neighbour China. He said the land of the dragon had become so powerful that it could look at the US in the eye now.        
	The jab at America and globalisation came three months after Bhattacharjee said the country could not afford to be insular.         
	The financial crisis has reached our country. It is a serious development. But we cant come to the conclu- sion that globalisation will take a back seat. We cant afford to do it. Its a must, he told a chamber of commerce gathering.        
	The meeting in Durgapur today also gave the chief minister an opportunity to trumpet the Lefts election agenda  job creation by industrialisation.        
	Bhattacharjee vowed to carry forward the industrialisation drive at any cost to create jobs for the states youth.        
	Later, inaugurating the 250-bed Mission Hospital in the industry town, Bhattacharjee said the state would have to look for private initiatives in the medical sector to improve healthcare.        
	He said the task of government hospitals was primarily to look after the poor. Those who have the means should go to private hospitals. It will lessen the burden on state hospitals, he said.

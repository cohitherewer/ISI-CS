                                                                                                               Mamata alert 
                            
	Calcutta, Sept. 30: Mamata Banerjee contacted the state government for the first time in recent memory this afternoon after receiving a text message on her cellphone about a possible attack by Maoists on home secretary Ardhendu Sen.        
	The Trinamul Congress chief spoke to Sen over the phone at 3.26pm after passing on the text message.         
	Mamata told the home secretary she had never spoken to him earlier but had to call him today as a common citizen after receiving the text message about the possible entry of Maoists in the guise of reporters at Writers to eliminate him, Trinamuls Partha Chatterjee said.        
	A Congress leader had forwarded the message to Mamata after getting it from an unknown number.

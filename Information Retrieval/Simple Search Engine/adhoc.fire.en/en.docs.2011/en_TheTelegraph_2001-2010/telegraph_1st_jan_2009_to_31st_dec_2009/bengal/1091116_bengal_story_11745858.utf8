          OUR BUREAU                              
	Calcutta, Nov. 15: Kabir Suman, the Trinamul Congress MP from Jadavpur, today launched an attack on his party, saying he felt suffocated in the organisation.        
	I cannot function independently as an MP. I have become a slave of the party. Frankly, I feel suffocated, Suman said on the sidelines of a programme at the Calcutta Press Club this afternoon.        
	I will be really happy if I am no longer an MP. I am not being able to work for development, Suman said. Be it the CPM or the other parties here, its all about making the most for oneself when in power.         
	Suman said it did not matter whether Trinamul or the CPM was in power till the mindset of politicians did not change. We have become too politicised and striving for power means everything to each one of us. There can be no progress or so-called parivartan (change) as long as the parivartan doesnt take place in our mindset, he said.        
	Suman said the rural bodies in South 24-Parganas were not working for development under Trinamul.         
	The CPM had control of the panchayats for so long. They didnt do anything for the people. What about those who are in power now? What have we done? he asked.        
	His parliamentary constituency Jadavpur is located in South 24-Parganas.        
	In South 24-Parganas, at least, there has been no progress at all since my party came to power. How long can this continue?         
	Trinamul sources said Sumans relations with the partys district president Sovan Chatterjee were strained.         
	Kabirda may not like the way Sovan is interfering in the functioning of the Trinamul-controlled zilla parishad and other rural bodies. He had brought it to Mamata Banerjees notice a month ago, said a Trinamul general secretary. Kabirda is unhappy with Sovan, who is dictating terms to the zilla parishad sabhadhipati Shamima Sheikh, he added.        
	Trinamul state president Subrata Bakshi was miffed. How could he claim there was no work done by the rural bodies? As an MP, he shouldnt have said all these things in public, he said. Bakshi said a meeting tomorrow would discuss the matter and contemplate appropriate action.        
	CPM leader Shyamal Chakraborty lauded Sumans honesty. Any man who has some dignity... cannot stay with Trinamul.

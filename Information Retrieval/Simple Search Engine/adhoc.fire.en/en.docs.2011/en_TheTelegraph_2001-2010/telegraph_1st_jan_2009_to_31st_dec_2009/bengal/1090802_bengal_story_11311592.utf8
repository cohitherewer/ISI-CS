	Calcutta, Aug. 1: Mamata Banerjee said her alliance with the Congress was there to stay, a day after the latter decided to pull out its candidates and let her contest both Assembly seats going to polls this month.        
	After a meeting of the Trinamul Congress core committee at the party headquarters, Mamata said: Lots of rumours are being spread about our relations with the Congress. But I should say our alliance with the Congress was there is there and will be there The alliance is there to stay.        
	Asked how she felt about the Congress surrendering to her, the Trinamul chief said: Im thankful to the Congress. We have no quarrel with the Congress. Trinamul is the second-largest partner of the UPA and the first ally of the Congress. Our relationship with the all-India leadership of the Congress is very good.        
	The state Congress had egged on the central leadership to contest the two seats if Mamata did not agree to their 1:1 formula. The relations were also perceived to have been soured after the Congress formed the municipal board in Uluberia following cross-voting.

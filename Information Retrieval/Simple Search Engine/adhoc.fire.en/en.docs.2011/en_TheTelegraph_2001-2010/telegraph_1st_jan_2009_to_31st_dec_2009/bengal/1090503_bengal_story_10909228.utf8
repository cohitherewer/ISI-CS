	Calcutta, May 2: The murder of a Trinamul Congress activist last night brought Nandigram to the brink of a flare-up five days before the area votes in the Lok Sabha elections.         
	Around midnight on Friday, four armed men broke into Prasanta Mandals house in the CPM stronghold of Khejuri, shot him in the head, allegedly molested his wife and raped his mother.        
	Twenty-five-year-old Prasanta died on the spot.        
	As news of the murder spread, around 5am today thousands of Trinamul supporters assembled near the Tekhali bridge, a landmark that earlier separated Trinamul and CPM areas after the shooting on March 14, 2007.         
	But before they could march to Khejuri, a large security contingent  of police and paramilitary  blocked their way.         
	The angry Trinamul activists then blocked the Kolaghat-Digha state highway from 6-11am.         
	The supporters cleared the road after Trinamul leaders asked them to.        
	But eight roads, all inside Nandigram and leading to Khejuri, were blocked till 2pm. The police contacted local Trinamul leaders and assured them that an impartial probe would be conducted into the murder. The roadblocks were lifted only after that.         
	Yesterday, Prasantas wife Parbati woke up hearing a car around midnight.         
	I woke up hearing the sound of a car. A few minutes later, someone knocked on the door asking us to open it. We did not because the voice was unknown to us, Parbati said.        
	The men broke open the door, overpowered my husband and one of them shot him in the head. Two of the attackers dragged me to another room and molested me, she said. On hearing the gun shot and Parbatis screams, Prasantas mother came out of her room. She tried to chase the attackers with a stick.        
	In her complaint lodged in Khejuri police station, Parbati said one of the goons slumped to the floor when her mother-in-law hit him with the stick. But one of the other three then raped her.        
	Pallab Ghosh, the East Midnapore superintendent of police, said: An investigation is on to ascertain whether political rivalry is the reason behind the killing. Since we have received a complaint of rape, Prasantas mother has been sent for a medical test.         
	Mamud Hossain, the general secretary of the Trinamul Congresss East Midnapore committee, said Prasanta was on the CPMs hit list as he was actively campaigning for the party in the area.         
	Prasanta had submitted his nomination for the last panchayat elections. But CPM cadres allegedly forced him to withdraw it because Prasantas house is in their stronghold, Hossain said.        
	He added that last week, Prasanta had organised a meeting that Trinamuls Contai candidate, Sisir Adhikary, addressed.        
	The Trinamul leader said chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee had gone to Contai yesterday where he met CPM leaders from Khejuri.         
	After the chief ministers rally, CPM supporters who came from West Midnapore entered Khejuri and murdered Prasanta, Hossain alleged.        
	Adhikary said he had requested the Election Commission to send central forces to Nandigram as soon as possible to ensure free and fair elections on May 7.         
	The CPMs Khejuri zonal committee secretary, Himangshu Das, said: I condemn the incident but Trinamul is accusing us with an intention to tarnish our image before the polls.

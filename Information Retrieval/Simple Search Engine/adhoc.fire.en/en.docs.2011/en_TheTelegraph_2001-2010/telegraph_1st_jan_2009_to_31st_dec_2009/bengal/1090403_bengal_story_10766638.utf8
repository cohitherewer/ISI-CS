	April 2: Voting will close two hours early in Maoist pockets in Jhargram and Purulia.        
	The official polling time is 7am to 5pm, but in Bandwan and Binpur in the Jhargram seat, and Joypur, Bagmundi and Balarampur in the Purulia constituency, polling will end at 3pm because of security reasons.         
	Debashis Sen, the states chief electoral officer, completed a tour of the Maoist-infested areas before making the announcement today.        
	He also said a resident from each polling booth area would be selected by the district magistrates to act as a volunteer on polling day. Each will be given the phone number of the local polling official to be contacted in case any untoward incident takes place.        
	Rao visit        
	AICC general secretary K. Keshava Rao, in charge of Bengal affairs, will arrive in Calcutta on Monday.         
	Sources said he may call on Trinamul Congress chief Mamata Banerjee. Rao will halt in Calcutta tomorrow on his way to the Andamans.

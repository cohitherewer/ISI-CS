The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Ragged fresher hangs himself 
                                                                                                               Ragged fresher hangs himself 
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                          Nayan Adak                                  
	Tamluk, Oct. 9: A boy who drank pesticide last month after being allegedly ragged by seniors in his Howrah college was found hanging in his home, three days before his father was to take him back to the campus.        
	Nayan Adak, a 19-year-old first-year student at the Calcutta Institute of Pharmaceutical Technology and Allied Health Sciences in Uluberia, alleged last month that his seniors told him to strip, dance and smoke and when he refused, they slashed his hands with a blade and injected something.        
	Nayan had joined the college in July as a day scholar.        
	He tried to commit suicide on September 9 but after being admitted to a nursing home for a week in Howrahs Alampur, he recovered.        
	Around 8am today, Nayans mother Maharani found his body hanging from a rope in their cow shed.         
	The college re-opened after Puja on October 6 but Nayan had not returned to class. A relative said his father Balaram Adak had wanted him to join classes.        
	Subal Adak, Nayans uncle, said: My elder brother is not a rich man. He owned about two acres, of which he sold some to raise about Rs 60,000 for Nayans course. As so much money was spent, my brother wanted Nayan to rejoin classes. Balaram spent Rs 30,000 on Nayans treatment after he tried to commit suicide, he said.        
	The uncle said Balaram would have accompanied Nayan to college on Monday. Nayan did not refuse. But now I think he committed suicide because he was scared to go back, Subal said.        
	He lodged a complaint at Tamluk police station today recounting the details of the alleged incident of ragging, after which he had registered a case in Uluberia police station on September 10.        
	Rabindra Debnath, the institute director, had said last month that the ragging allegation was baseless.        
	The head of the department of pharmacy at the college, Manas Chakraborty, today said Nayans family had not informed them about the suicide.        
	A police officer in Uluberia said Nayan had not co-operated with them during the investigation. After Nayan was released from the nursing home, he did not co-operate with us. He did not tell us who ragged him, the police officer said.        
	Howrah superintendent of police H.K. Kusumakar said after Nayans family filed the police complaint, he sent his officers to meet the boy. But he refused to identify those who had ragged him and where, he said.        
	Nayans family admitted that the police had visited them. We thought we would meet the police once Nayan rejoined college, said Subal.

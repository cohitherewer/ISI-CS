The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Congress plays bypoll card
                                                                                                               Congress plays bypoll card
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Calcutta, Jan. 29: The Congress high commands decision to field a candidate in the Bishnupur (West) Assembly bypoll has raised the prospects of harder bargaining for an alliance with the Trinamul Congress for the Lok Sabha elections.        
	The Congresss Mamtazuddin Gazi, who had bagged around 14,925 votes in 2006, was chosen again last night to take on Trinamuls Madan Mitra in the South 24-Parganas seat.         
	The BJP has already put up Tapan Ghosh as its nominee, making the February 26 bypoll a four-cornered contest.         
	We were left with no option other than to field our candidate. The high command might have considered if Mamata had at least spoken to us before unilaterally announcing her candidate, said Congress legislature party chief Manas Bhunia.        
	Asked if there was any possibility of withdrawing the nominee, he replied in the negative.         
	Mamata today said she would go it alone against the ruling CPM in the bypoll if the Congress did not back her nominee. Should I wait for those who once had taken help from the CPM to stick to power at the Centre? Or should I go alone? she asked a crowd in a rally in Krishnagar. Didi, we all want you to fight alone, they replied in unison.         
	Trinamul leaders, however, expressed the fear that the Opposition votes would split and help the CPM.

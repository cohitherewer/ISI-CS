	Behrampore, Feb. 2: A 12-year-old girl was allegedly raped by a group of teenagers and throttled to death in Murshidabad town last night.        
	Local residents traced one of the accused to a house in the vicinity, dragged him out and thrashed him until police arrived.        
	The 17-year-old had called Class V student Saki Khatoon out of her aunts house last evening. The girl never returned home.         
	Her body, which bore multiple injuries, was found in a mango orchard in the towns Motijheel area this morning.        
	The police said preliminary investigations suggested Saki had been gangraped before being killed. We have arrested the boy and are interrogating him, said superintendent Basab Dasgupta.        
	The arrested boy has been charged with rape and murder. An officer said he told the police there were three others  aged 15 to 16 and all from the same locality  with him. We have launched a hunt for them, the officer said.        
	The girl had gone to her aunts house, about 300 metres from her home, with her father last evening. Babu Sheikh, 42, a cycle van operator, had returned home after some time, leaving his daughter behind.        
	Around 7pm, the boy called Saki. We knew him as a neighbourhood boy and so I did not give it a second thought when Saki walked away towards the main road with him, said her aunt Mala.         
	I became worried around 8pm and called Sakis father.        
	Babu went to the boys house but did not find him there. He them looked for his only daughter in all probable places, houses of relatives and friends and the local market.        
	The search, in which local residents joined Babu, was called off around midnight. It resumed at daybreak. The body was found around 6.30am.        
	Hours later, a man said he had seen one of the boys enter Chand Mohammads home. A mob set out for the 55-year-old farmers house, not far from Babus place.        
	Around 200 people ransacked the house and set it ablaze. The boy was beaten up, a police officer said.        
	Chand and his three sons were in the field then. His wife and daughter-in-law fled seeing the mob.         
	The families of Chand and the boy are known to be friends. The farmer told the police he had allowed the boy into his house not knowing what he had done earlier.        
	The boys parents are missing from their home.        
	If the accused in this case are indeed below 18, they will be tried by the Juvenile Justice Board.         
	Even if found guilty of rape and murder, the board cannot send them to jail. They will either be sent to a government-run home or to their parents, on personal bonds, where their conducts will be reviewed every year. The parents will have to assure the board that they will produce the boys before it at least once a month.        
	If the boys turn 18 while staying at a government home and the authorities say their conduct hasnt improved, they may be sent to jail. An improvement in conduct will lead to their release.

          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Tamluk, June 1: A 10-year-old girl returning home with her mother after a holiday at her uncles was shot dead this morning when Trinamul Congress and CPM supporters were clashing with bombs and bullets at Bhupatinagar in Contai, East Midnapore.        
	Police said Sayantika Rakshit, who was on a rickshaw with her mother, took the bullet behind her right ear.         
	A bullet pierced the abdomen of barber Ujjal Sheet, who was trying to down his shutters in a hurry and run.        
	Class V student Sayantika was the only child of her parents, Kharagpur residents who had gone to Bhupatinagar for Jamai Sashti (on Friday). Her father, who works with a pharmaceutical company in Calcutta, had left for home last night because he had to go to office today.         
	Sayantikas death comes three weeks after 23-month-old Sania Khatoon was killed in Nandigram, about 40km away. A bullet had hit her when CPM supporters were firing shots to intimidate Trinamul supporters who had defied their diktat and voted in the March 7 Lok Sabha polls.         
	Today, the trouble started around 9am with an altercation between supporters of the two parties inside a tea stall at Harinabari village, a Trinamul stronghold.        
	CPM supporters beat up two Trinamul men who had switched from their party before last years panchayat polls. As news of the assault spread, about 500 Trinamul men rushed in and a clash started in which both sides fired and hurled bombs, said a police officer.         
	The clash spread to neighbouring villages, where Sayantika and her mother were caught.

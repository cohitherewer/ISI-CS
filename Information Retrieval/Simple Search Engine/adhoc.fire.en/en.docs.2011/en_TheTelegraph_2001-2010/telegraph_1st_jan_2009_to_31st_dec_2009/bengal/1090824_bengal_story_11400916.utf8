	Malda, Aug. 23: The last guard wall protecting a habitation of 25,000 people in Malda gave way this evening and the Fulhar rushed into one village after another.        
	The water level in the bazaar at Bhaluka, about 500 metres from the river, was over two feet around 9pm. District officials said it was rising alarmingly and the only hope for the residents was the a local canals capacity to hold water.        
	People from the entire Bhaluka panchayat area were being evacuated till late tonight. There are many who do not want to leave their homes behind. Those who have two storeys have already abandoned the ground floor. People are taking shelter at their neighbours rather than shifting. This may prove to be a problem, said district magistrate Sridhar Ghosh.        
	The entire Harishchandrapur II  of which Bhaluka is a part  and Ratua I and Chanchol II blocks are likely to be flooded because of tonights breach. Around three lakh people live in the three blocks.         
	The guard wall, made of sandbags and bamboo poles, gave way around 6pm. A 25-year-old embankment that formed the first line of defence against the river was washed away last night. The Fulhar has crossed the extreme danger level, said an official.

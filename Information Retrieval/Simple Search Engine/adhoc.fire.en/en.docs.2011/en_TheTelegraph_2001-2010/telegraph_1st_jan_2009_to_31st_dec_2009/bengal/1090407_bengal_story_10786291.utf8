The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Pranab good, his party bad
                                                                                                               Pranab good, his party bad
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              Bose and Mukherjee: Bengal bond				                                 
	Calcutta, April 6: The CPMs Bengal leadership today contested Pranab Mukherjees charges on the failures of the Left Front government but made it evident that it wouldnt burn bridges with the Lefts most-trusted Congress leader in view of the post-poll possibilities at the Centre.        
	Biman Bose called Mukherjees report card, in which the states scores were mostly in the red, a bundle of lies.         
	However, the state CPM secretary gave the foreign minister and Bengal Congress chief the benefit of the doubt and blamed Sonia Gandhi. Pranabbabu is an erudite and knowledgeable person, a teacher and a professor who knows the nations vital statistics in and out. He did not produce the bundle of Congress lies... he only parroted a script prepared by others under compulsion as the Congress president had directed him to do, Bose said.         
	The Congress tirade against the Bengal government is aimed at reducing the Lefts strength in the new Parliament, he added.         
	Bose took pains to make a distinction between Mukherjee and the rest of the Congress leadership. He (Mukherjee) said whatever he was told to as the state Congress chief.        
	Days before sealing the deal with Mamata Banerjee, Mukherjee had praised the states record in rural infrastructure development and thanked the chief minister for the healthcare now available in Bengal. He had even said he didnt want partisan politics to block the states development, the CPM leader said.         
	Bose declined to accuse Mukherjee of doublespeak. I cant say he is taking a double role. He is doing as directed.        
	Insiders said the CPM was handling Mukherjee with kid gloves both in Delhi and Cal- cutta hoping to drive a wedge between the top Congress leadership and the foreign min-ister. The party also wants to play on disgruntlement in the Congress ranks over the deal with Mamata by stressing on Mukherjees compulsions.         
	The Congress veteran, who came close to the Left during backroom parleys with the CPMs Harkishen Singh Surjeet to make or break governments, acknowledges its support to him as a possible presidential candidate before Pratibha Patil was picked.         
	According to Left leaders, Surjeets successor Prakash Karat may have made it clear that he would sit in the Opposition rather than accept a government led by Manmohan Singh, but he may not be averse to promoting Mukherjee as a more acceptable prime ministerial candidate if the situation so demands.

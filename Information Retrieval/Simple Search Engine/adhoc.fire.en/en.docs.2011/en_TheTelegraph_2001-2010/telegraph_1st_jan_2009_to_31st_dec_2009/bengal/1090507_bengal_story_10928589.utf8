The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Class XI boy dies in crossfire 
                                                                                                               Class XI boy dies in crossfire 
                            
	Behrampore, May 6: A Class XI student was killed and his friend injured when a bomb lobbed during a clash between Congress and CPM supporters landed on his house.        
	Liakat Ali was with classmate Basid Sheikh in the courtyard of his house in Murshidabads Samshergunj this afternoon when hit by splinters.         
	Although in Murshidabad, the area is under Malda South Lok Sabha constituency, which voted on April 30.        
	Around 1pm, the warring groups gathered at the two ends of Sulitila village and started hurling bombs at each other. There were a couple of heavy explosions close by and I rushed out of my room and saw my son in a pool of blood. Basids legs were bleeding, said Liakats mother Rabeya.        
	At the block hospital, Liakat, 17, was declared dead. Basid was referred to the Jangipur Subdivisional Hospital.         
	Rabeya, whose husband is a grocer, said precious time was lost because the hail of bombs kept neighbours from coming to their help.         
	The clashes began last night. Murshidabad police chief B.L. Meena said two arrests had been made.         
	Liakat was an average student but good-natured, said Mohd Hasanuzzaman, a teacher of Dhuliyan High School.

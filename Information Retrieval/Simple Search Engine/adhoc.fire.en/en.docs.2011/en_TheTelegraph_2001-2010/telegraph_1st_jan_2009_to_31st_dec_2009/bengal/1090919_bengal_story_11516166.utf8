The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Power share buzz for mayor chair
                                                                                                               Power share buzz for mayor chair
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Mamata Banerjee and Deepa Das Munshi                          
	Calcutta, Sept. 18: The Congress and the Trinamul Congress may opt for a power-sharing formula for the Siliguri mayors post if talks between the allies fail, sources said today.        
	Local-level talks will be held on Sunday or Monday in Siliguri. Leaders from both the parties said power-sharing would be the last resort.        
	According to the formula, the Siliguri civic board would be headed by a mayor from one of the two parties for two and a half years, then by a mayor of the other party for the remaining two and a half.         
	A similar arrangement was worked out between the Congress and the PDP in Jammu and Kashmir in 2002.         
	State Congress chief Pranab Mukherjee had suggested power-sharing in Uluberia municipality for the selection of its chairman two months ago. There, the Congress and Trinamul had won 15 seats each.        
	However, the Congress did not go by the formula later and got its chairman elected with the BJPs support.         
	Pranabda might ask us to adopt the same power-sharing formula if we fail to reach a consensus at the lower level in Siliguri, said a senior Congress leader from Delhi.         
	In the Siliguri municipal elections, the Congress won 15 seats and Trinamul 14 but Mamata Banerjees party claimed the support of an Independent, Ranjan Sil Sharma, who came to Calcutta to show his support for Trinamul.         
	With Sil Sharmas support, both parties now have 15 seats each.        
	However, Deepa Das Munshi, the Congress MP from Raiganj, today said in Calcutta that her party would stick to its demand for the mayors post.         
	The mayors post has to be given to the Congress as our party is a bigger force in north Bengal, she said before leaving for Siliguri.        
	Deepa had been asked to oversee the Siliguri civic polls.         
	Mamata refused to react to Deepas statement but Trinamuls Mukul Roy said: It is not right to stake claim to the mayors post when discussions at the local level have not started.         
	Trinamul leader Partha Chatterjee today said he would meet the councillors from both the Congress and his own party to work out a consensus on who should be the Siliguri mayor.         
	I shall shortly meet elected councillors from both the Congress and Trinamul Congress.... Our primary concern will be to safeguard the interests of the alliance so that we can take on the ruling CPM in 2011 Assembly polls, he said tonight.

	Calcutta, Jan. 28: A bus mowed down two waiting commuters at the Ultadanga crossing after climbing onto a pavement tonight.        
	A third victim is in a critical condition.        
	Around 9.15pm, scores of people waiting for public transport at the Ultadanga-VIP Road intersection saw the Esplanade-Barasat bus veer towards an underpass instead of taking the Durgapur Bridge, which leads to VIP Road.         
	Many bystanders ran and managed to save themselves, or else the toll could have been higher, a traffic police officer said.        
	The bus ran over the three and stopped after hitting a road divider.         
	The dead have been identified as Chandan Kumar Saha, 32, a resident of Lake Town, and Rajanya Biswas, 19.         
	Rajanyas mother Sudipta Biswas, 38, is in hospital.        
	All three were taken to the nearby ESI Hospital, where Chandan and Rajanya were declared brought dead.        
	Rajanyas father Bijoy Biswas, who rushed to the hospital late in the night, collapsed after identifying his daughter and wife. He has also been hospitalised.        
	The police said prelimi- nary investigations suggested that the brakes of the bus on route No. DN 17 had failed. Instead of plying along the southern slope of the bridge, it veered towards the narrow lane leading to the underpass of the bridge, said an officer.        
	The driver and the conductor fled the scene. We have impounded the vehicle, the officer added.        
	An accident was waiting to happen at the crossing. It teems with pedestrians, commuters waiting for buses and shoppers through the day as autos, taxis, shuttle cabs and buses jostle for vantage positions to pick people,        
	In the absence of a designated bus stop, commuters wait at the foot of the bridge.         
	Some vehicles pick passengers at the traffic signal and others at the foot of the bridge, leading to confusion.

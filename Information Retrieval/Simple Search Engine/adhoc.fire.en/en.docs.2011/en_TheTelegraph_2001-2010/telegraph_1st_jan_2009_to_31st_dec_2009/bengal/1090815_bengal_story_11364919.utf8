  - Pensioner donates plot when none will even sell        ABHIJEET CHATTERJEE                           Haradhan Mondal watches the water tank come up on his land. Picture by Gour Sharma                                        
	Asansol, Aug. 14: An Asansol resident has donated his farmland for the construction of a reservoir at a time owners across the state are refusing to part with their plots even for a price.        
	Haradhan Mondal offered his half an acre when the project was about to be shifted following the civic authorities futile attempts to convince residents to give their land.         
	An acre sells for Rs 4.5 lakh at Bakbandi, on the fringes of Asansol town. The civic body was prepared to shell that out, but there were no takers.        
	Only one paddy crop grows in a year at Bakbandi, but the land was too precious to lose for its residents.         
	Around 80km away in Katwa, also in Burdwan district like Asansol, residents are re-fusing to hand over land for a power plant. The Trinamul Congress is backing the protesters who have vowed to resist acquisition, though it is for a development project.        
	But Mondal, a retired Da-modar Valley Corporation (DVC) technician who had engaged a sharecropper to cultivate paddy, wheat and vegetables on his plot, thought beyond his own good. I realised that if the reservoir was shifted, ab- out 10,000 people of seven villages would suffer. We have had a water crisis for years and during summer, the situation worsens, said the 65-year-old who got Rs 15,000 to 18,000 a year as his share from the crops to supplement his monthly pension of Rs 5,000.        
	For Mondal, the choice wasnt difficult. Even though I will lose the crop, the reservoir is more important, he said.        
	Yadab Mandal, the commissioner of Asansol Municipal Corporation, which is building the reservoir, dubbed Mondal an example. Haradhanbabu donated the land to us in June. But we had started construction in February on the basis of his verbal consent. He helped us when we were in trouble, Yadab said.        
	Mondals family  three sons and two daughters, all of whom are married  stood behind him despite having limited resources. His elder son Swapan, a schoolteacher, is the only one with a steady income apart from Mondal. The other sons are casual workers at a nearby DVC substation.         
	Initially I was in a dilemma because the family depends on my income and my fathers pension. My younger brothers dont earn much. The income from the land came in handy. But later we realised that our next generation will benefit from what my father has done, said Swapan.        
	His wife Amita felt the donation was the first big step to better days. I and my mother-in-law have to fetch water from abandoned coal mines or ponds one-and-a-half kilometres away in summer. If the reservoir comes up, the situation will change. The public health engineering department supplies water only once in a day to the area. But what comes through taps is inadequate        
	The reservoir, with a capacity of 1.5 lakh gallons a day, is the largest of the eight planned in the Asansol civic bodys area. They are part of a Rs 100-crore project being executed under the Centres Jawaharlal Nehru National Urban Renewable Mission to ensure 24-hour water supply to households in the town.

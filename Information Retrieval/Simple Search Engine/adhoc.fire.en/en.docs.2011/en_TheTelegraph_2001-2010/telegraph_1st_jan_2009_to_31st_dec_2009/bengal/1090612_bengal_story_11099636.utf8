The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Flyovers in Saugata hand
                                                                                                               Flyovers in Saugata hand
          ANANYA SENGUPTA                              
	New Delhi, June 11: The Trinamul Congresss Saugata Roy has bagged plum responsibilities as the junior Union urban development minister and promised to help Calcut- tas second Metro network meet its 2014 deadline.        
	He will handle projects like the Jawaharlal Nehru Urban renewal Mission and urban transport and has got indepen- dent charge of the directorate of printing and controller of publication, stationery and building materials, whose head offices are in Calcutta.        
	Roy said: I am very happy. The work given to me is central to the ministry. My priority is to look at the JNNURM (urban renewal) projects in Bengal.        
	The first thing Roy said he would ensure was that the East-West metro kept its deadline. The city also has a slew of projects lined up under the urban mission, like the construction of flyovers connecting Howrah Bridge and Vivekananda Road and Paroma Island and Park Circus, development and management of water supply and sewerage systems in Sector V, Salt Lake.        
	Sources said the decision to hand so much to Roy was an indication that the Centre wanted to invest heavily on Bengals infrastructure ahead of the 2011 Assembly polls.

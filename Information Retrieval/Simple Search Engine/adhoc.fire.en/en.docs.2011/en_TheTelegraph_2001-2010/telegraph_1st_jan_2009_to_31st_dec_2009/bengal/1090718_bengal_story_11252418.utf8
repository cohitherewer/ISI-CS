The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Highway in a muddle
                                                                                                               Highway in a muddle
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Calcutta, July 17: The finance ministers announcement in the Assembly yesterday that the government will not proceed with the Salim-sponsored Barasat-Raichak expressway has created confusion about its fate, sources said.        
	Word spread yesterday that Asim Dasgupta had asserted the project had been scrapped. But sources close to the finance minister today said Dasgupta had said the government would not proceed with the project and not that it had been scrapped, leaving questions as to what would happen to it now.        
	Some officials in the state administration wondered why the government didnt care to consult the Salim Group before making the announcement. Why were they kept in the dark? And why is the finance minister merely saying that the government will not proceed with the project but stopping short of declaring that it has been scrapped? There seems to be a lot of confusion in this regard, an official of the chief ministers secretariat said.         
	Uncertainty clouds the project further in the wake of a strong reaction from Pra- soon Mukherjee, director of the New Kolkata International Development, a partner of the Salim Group, expressing surprise at the development. We are surprised. This was not known to us. I do not know how one of the parties can take a decision when there is an agreement signed between the Bengal government and us, he said.        
	The proposed 108km highway was intended to connect Barasat in North 24-Parganas to Raichak in South. It would have linked Dum Dum airport and Haldia port without break. Several clusters of amenities and a township at the Haldia end were also part of it.         
	After the panchayat elections last year, the chief minister had said at a meeting in north Bengal that the highway project had been stopped for the time being but did not utter the word scrapped or that the government will not continue.        
	We have stopped the project (expressway) for the time being because of the objections. We will not force them (farmers and landholders). We will not work in that manner, Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee had told a meeting about 20km from Siliguri.        
	The chief minister and finance minister are saying different things. The NKID (developers New Kolkata) is claiming that it was unaware of the governments stand. The land minister hasnt spoken a word about acquisition for the highway. Given these conflicting developments, the fate of the expressway is not clear, an industries department official said.        
	Whats all the more surprising is that the West Bengal Industrial Development Corporation had sent the land acquisition proposal for the expressway to both the South and North 24-Parganas collectors over a year ago but it hasnt yet got any feedback from any of them.        
	We havent been told why the land hasnt been acquired by the collectors or whether it (the job) would be done in the future. Moreover, we are not aware of any decision on the project being scrapped, a WBIDC official said.        
	Theres one more area of confusion  that it was the finance minister and not industries minister Nirupam Sen who made the announcement in the Assembly that the government would not proceed with the Salim project.        
	While presenting the industries budget in the House on Tuesday, Sen had not spoken a word on the expressway.        
	The finance minister made the announcement as he was speaking on the appropriation bill that covers every department. He had no intention to intrude into someone elses portfolio, a finance department official said.         
	The decision was taken following a discussion with the chief minister, Dasgupta had told the House yesterday.        
	This prompted speculation whether the chief minister had bypassed Sen deliberately and given it to Dasgupta to make the announcement in order to make a political point.         
	It is an open secret in the CPM that Sen and Dasgupta dont get along too well.

                                                                                                               Plane delay
                            
	Calcutta, Jan. 20: A plane from Agartala hovered over Calcutta for 15 minutes this evening and a flight to Nagpur was held back after a pilot reported seeing a hyena.         
	An inspection team, however, did not find any animal.

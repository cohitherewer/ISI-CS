The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Rebel killed in village revenge
                                                                                                               Rebel killed in village revenge
                            
	Sept. 8: A Maoist was dragged out of his home last night and killed, apparently by villagers fed up with the guerrillas.        
	You have killed many and brought the Maoists to our area. Well kill you, someone said when Ranjit Singh Sardar, 30, pleaded for his life in West Midnapores Belpahari, about 70km from Lalgarh.        
	Ranjit, a fugitive wanted by the police, had come home to spend time with his family.        
	They banged on the door around midnight and called out for my son. As he opened the door, about 20 people barged in. Ranjit pleaded with them to let him go and they retorted you have killed many said his 60-year-old father.        
	The outburst of anger may not be an isolated incident. On Sunday, the residents of a Lalgarh village had caught three armed Maoists heading to a revered CPM leaders house.         
	Police, however, would not say if it was a changing trend. We had been looking for Ranjit. But we are yet to ascertain who killed him, said district police chief Manoj Verma.        
	The residents of the village where Ranjit was killed admi-tted that a resistance had been taking shape. Many of our people have been killed since the Lalgarh agitation began, a leader of the group said.        
	However, last night itself, Maoists killed two CPM supporters in Bankuras Sarenga, 15km from Belpahari.

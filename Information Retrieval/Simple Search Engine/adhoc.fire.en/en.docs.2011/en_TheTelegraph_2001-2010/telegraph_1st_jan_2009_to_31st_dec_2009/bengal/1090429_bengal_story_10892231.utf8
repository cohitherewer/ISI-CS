The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Swine flu alert across Bengal
                                                                                                               Swine flu alert across Bengal
          OUR BUREAU                                            
	April 28: Bengal today issued a statewide swine flu alert and decided to quarantine anyone coming from North America, Europe and Mexico with symptoms of the disease.        
	Those coming from the swine flu-hit countries with symptoms of the disease will be sent to the Infectious Diseases (ID) Hospital in Beleghata for tests, said a senior Calcutta airport official.        
	Although no swine flu case has been reported in India, the alert was issued to prevent an outbreak, health services director Sanchita Bakshi said.         
	According to the plan, a passenger with fever, running nose or any other flu symptom (see chart) will be isolated. If it is revealed that the passenger had been to a swine flu-hit area, the person will immediately be sent to the ID hospital.        
	An official in Delhi said all passengers arriving in India from the flu-hit areas would be screened. We will also ask passengers whove arrived within the past 10 days to report to us if they experience symptoms, V.M. Katoch, secretary of the department of health research, told The Telegraph.         
	Health authorities across the country were scrambling today to put in place the screening system and waiting for the immigration bureau to provide them details of the passengers who had arrived from Mexico, Canada or the US over the past 10 days. It cant be done overnight, an official said.         
	Calcutta airport is likely to set up four screening counters and would require about 12 doctors for three shifts, said airport health officer Amaresh Chandra De.        
	The symptoms of swine flu are the same as that of the common influenza. Doctors said there were no confirmatory tests for the disease in the country now, but the World Health Organization had developed a blood test kit and it should be available in a few days.         
	There is nothing to panic. We are taking steps according to WHO guidelines, state health minister Surjya Kanta Mishra said.         
	A special isolation ward has been set up at the ID Hospital and ventilators have been arranged, said health service director Bakshi. All districts have been told to report suspected cases.        
	The Union health ministry will release guidelines to help doctors across the country diagnose suspected cases or recognise unusual clusters of influenza-like illness.        
	Swine flu is common in pigs. People dont normally get it, but there is always a possibility of infection among those in regular contact with pigs.        
	The state animal husbandry department has a piggery at Mohanpur, in Nadias Haringhata. There are thousands of unorganised piggeries across the state, including Calcutta, an official said.        
	According to experts, people with swine flu should be considered potentially contagious as long as they show the symptoms. Children might be contagious for longer periods.        
	The virus triggered panic after several swine flu cases were reported in the US. Over 1,000 people have been taken ill in Mexico City.         
	Drug stocks        
	Central health authorities today decided to increase their stockpile of the antiviral drug oseltamivir three-fold. The Centre will also ask manufacturers to maintain raw material as reserve for rapid production, sources said.

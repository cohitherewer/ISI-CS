The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Goddess of gold stays in bank vault
                                                                                                               Goddess of gold stays in bank vault
          AMIT UKIL                          The gold Durga idol                                  
	Purulia, Sept. 27: She weighs 950gm, stays in a bank vault and is escorted out by police once every year after surviving a robbery attempt.        
	The idol of Durga which makes a 27km high-security trip to its mandap is made of gold and is at least 150 years old. The idol belongs to the Joypur rajbari in Purulia.        
	During the Puja, the Durga idol is brought to the ancestral home of Birendra Narain Singh Deo, the 86-year-old descendant of Kashinath Singha, the king of Joypur.         
	When the idol resides in the household, six armed policemen guard the house round the clock.        
	Kashinath Singha had got the gold idol made.         
	He ordered the idol to be cast in Benaras. It is made of gold weighing one sere (nearly 950 grams) and styled on the Mahamaya Kanak Durga idol in Benaras, said Shankar Narain Singh Deo, Birendras son and the sabhapati of the Joypur panchayat samiti.         
	The chalchitra (the decoration behind the idol) is made of silver weighing 60kg, he added. The actual value of the idol is as an antique. Although we are not experts, I would say it would be valued at least around Rs 1crore.        
	There was an attempt to rob the idol from the family safe in 1970, but the robbers did not know that it had been sent for polishing that very night.         
	Since then the idol has sat in a bank vault in Purulia town.        
	Every year for the last 39 years, the idol has travelled from the vault to a small pandal inside the household on Panchami and been brought back on Dashami.         
	Two police vehicles, one in front and the other behind the car carrying the idol, escort the goddess to the rajbari.        
	Purulia superintendent of police Rajesh Yadav said: The tradition continues to this day. We provide the escort and the armed guards and bear the expenses. The idol was taken to Joypur on Panchami this year and will be brought back after the Puja.

          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Alipurduar, March 7: The Jalpaiguri RSP leadership wrote to the partys state brass today, requesting them to consider if dropped MP Joachim Buxla could be accommodated as a candidate.         
	Buxla, the Alipurduar MP, was replaced by junior PWD minister Manohar Tirkey.         
	We heard Buxla out at a meeting today. We are sending a report to our state leadership with a request to see if Buxla could be accommodated in the list of Left Front nominees, Sunil Banik, secretary of the RSP district committee, said after the meeting today.        
	We have requested our senior state leaders to come here on March 12 to resolve the issue, he added.         
	RSP state leaders had earlier said they had taken into account the demands of the rank and file while replacing all three party MPs from Bengal. Buxla is a four-time MP.        
	Also denied tickets, Katwa CPM MP Abu Ayesh Mondal and the Forward Blocs Hiten Burman have quit their parties. Both leaders are in touch with the Trinamul Congress.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Buddha warns of disconnect
                                                                                                               Buddha warns of disconnect
          BISWAJIT ROY                                                Bhattacharjee        
	Calcutta, March 1: Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee is said to have rung the alarm bell today at a closed-door meeting of the CPM, telling leaders that the poor had deserted the party because elected representatives do not bother to listen to them.        
	The chief minister, sources said, did not see the Trinamul-Congress bypoll understanding as the only factor responsible for the CPMs defeat by over 30,000 votes to Trinamuls Madan Mitra in Bishnupur West.        
	We have lost in Bishnupur because poor people have left us considerably. We may have organisational shortcomings, but the biggest problem is that we have lost our contact with the people. Our leaders, elected representatives do not bother to visit commoners and listen to them. They expect people would come to them, Bhattacharjee was quoted as saying at the meeting.         
	The CPM lost around 7 per cent of its vote share, not 1 per cent as party state secretary Biman Bose claimed.         
	The CPMs vote share came down to 54,938 or 37.39 per cent this time from 44.37 per cent in 2006 when the total votes polled were 1,37,295.        
	Trinamuls Madan Mitra polled 58 per cent of the total 1,46,935 votes this time  a big leap from 41 per cent in 2006.         
	The figures indicate that a section of CPM voters in the South-24 Parganas seat switched to the united Opposition, contributing to the impressive victory margin for Trinamul, party insiders said.         
	Officially, no one said they considered todays result indicative of a trend that may be seen in the Lok Sabha polls but Bhattacharjee reportedly said: If we want to win the four seats (in South-24 Parganas), we have to mend our ways right now and reach out to the people.        
	In private, CPM leaders and front partners admitted that Bishnupur had added to their worries about at least 10 Lok Sabha seats.         
	After the panchayat poll upset last May, the Left lost the Nandigram and Sujapur (Malda) bypolls.         
	Biman Bose said he had predicted (todays) defeat by such a huge margin inside the party before the result came out. He cited the united Opposition as one of the factors behind it.         
	The result was not unexpected to me. Though there was no formal alliance last time, there was a tacit understanding and the Congress polled more than 10,000 votes. This time, there was a formal alliance and the Congress votes went entirely to the Trinamul candidate, Bose said.        
	Bose also spoke of a weak organisation in the constituency. Our party organisation was not exactly strong in the area. We failed to reach out to the masses effectively. So, we could not improve our result, he said.         
	Asked about the erosion of support base, Bose said: Perhaps, some people voted for the Opposition considering that it would not make or break the state government.         
	But he refused to see in the defeat a possible trend for the Lok Sabha polls. The parliamentary polls would be fought on different issues and the voters concerns would be different, he said.         
	Senior leader Benoy Konar, however, refused to admit the CPM had alienated voters. Sometimes, people drink poison knowingly. So, we have to make people more conscious, said the state secretariat member.

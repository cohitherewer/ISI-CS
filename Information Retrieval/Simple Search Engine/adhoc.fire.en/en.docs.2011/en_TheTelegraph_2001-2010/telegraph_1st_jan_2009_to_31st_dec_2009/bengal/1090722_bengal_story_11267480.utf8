The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Mangalkot attack
                                                                                                               Mangalkot attack
                            
	Burdwan, July 21: A mob last night attacked the homes of two Congress supporters in Mangalkot who had fled their village fearing reprisal after the murder of a CPM leader.        
	A haystack in Paresh Mondals house and a barn stocked with paddy at Tapas Mondals were torched at Brahmmapur, some 4km from the village where Congress MLAs were ass-aulted last Wednesday.        
	The alleged CPM attackers regrouped this morning and burst at least a dozen bombs in the village. Brahmmapur has been almost devoid of men since last evening, when they left for todays rally in Calcutta, and villagers said the CPM goons took advantage of that.         
	Some like Paresh and Tapas had also been staying away from homes since Falguni Mukherjees murder on June 15. Their families today fled to relatives houses in Katwa town, about 20km away.

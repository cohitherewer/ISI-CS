The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Shield for inter-caste marriage
                                                                                                               Shield for inter-caste marriage
          OUR LEGAL REPORTER                              
	Calcutta, July 21: The high court today said there was no bar on inter-caste marriage in the Hindu Marriage Act and asked police to provide protection to a newlywed couple facing social boycott in a Burdwan village.         
	They are adults and have the right to live a peaceful conjugal life, Justice Sanjib Banerjee said.         
	Medicine wholesaler Barun Bagdi and Mandira Roy got married at Bhatkundu village in Bud Bud in April. Villagers ostracised the Bagdis in protest. Shopkeepers refused to sell essentials and a section of villagers also advised them to leave the place.        
	Mandiras father Sanatan lodged an FIR alleging that Barun had kidnapped his minor daughter. He produced a HS exam admit card to prove she was too young for marriage. Sanatan also instigated villagers to protest against them, said Udayshankar Chatterjee, the couples lawyer.         
	After Mandira submitted a birth certificate that showed she was 19, her father had argued that the villagers would not accept her marriage and it should be annulled.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Illegal move
                                                                                                               Illegal move
                            
	Calcutta, Oct. 26: A tussle between various state departments played out in Calcutta High Court today with the governments lawyer saying the CMDA had illegally handed over 120 acres to the fisheries department in 1988.        
	Fisheries minister Kiranmoy Nanda had objected to the handover of a 15-acre plot near EM Bypass for an institute saying it was a wetland. The government challenged the claim, saying it was jungle land in records.         
	During the hearing of a case moved by a fishermens co-operative, lawyer Supriyo Basu said: As a government agency, the CMDA had no right to give the 120 acres (from which it later carved out 15 for the institute) to the fisheries department in 1988. It was illegal.         
	The judge asked the government to file an affidavit clearing its stand on the character of the land.

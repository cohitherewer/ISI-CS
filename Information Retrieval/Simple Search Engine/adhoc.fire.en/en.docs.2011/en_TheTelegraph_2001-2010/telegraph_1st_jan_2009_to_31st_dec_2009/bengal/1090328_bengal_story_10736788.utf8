                                                                                                               Adhir grudge
                            
	Calcutta, March 27: Behrampore MP Adhir Chowdhury today complained to state Congress chief Pranab Mukherjee that local Trinamul Congress leaders were not interested in a joint campaign.         
	No Trinamul leader has extended any co-operation to us. But it matters little because we can take on the CPM on our own, Chowdhury said.        
	The Trinamul chief had last night drawn Mukherjees attention to the way some Congress leaders like Abdul Mannan and Shankar Singh had stayed away from joint campaigns in Hooghly and Nadia.

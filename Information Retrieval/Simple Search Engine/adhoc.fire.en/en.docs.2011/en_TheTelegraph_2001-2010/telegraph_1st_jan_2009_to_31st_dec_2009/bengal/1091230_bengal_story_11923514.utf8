The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Maoist chat bar on officials
                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      Maoist chat bar on officials
          OUR BUREAU                              
	Dec. 29: Senior state officials have been told not to speak to leaders of outlawed organisations, the home secretary said today, confirming a rec-ent call from Maoist Kishanji to the environment secretary.        
	Weve asked the environment secretary and other senior officials not to speak to leaders of outlawed organisations, including the CPI (Maoist), Ardhendu Sen said.         
	Asked about the call to M.L. Meena, the chief minister had said in Delhi two days ago that he had only read about it in the papers.        
	Today, Meena refused to speak. The Maoist military wing chief had called him on December 19, apparently to complain about pollution by sponge iron factories.         
	The day before, Maoists had torched a sponge iron plant and over a dozen vehicles parked on its premises near Jhargram, West Midnapore.        
	Sen said: There is no question of holding talks with the Maoists unless they stop the violence. And how could they complain about pollution after their arson caused further pollution?         
	In Bankura, Maoists last night killed a CPM supporter who owned a liquor shop.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Cap on violence after bloody day

	Calcutta, Jan. 3: Mamata Banerjee appeared to be toning down her protests against the bid to rid the city of smoke-belching autos, possibly after realising that the images of burning buses and rampaging supporters leaping out of television screens may frighten her voters before the upcoming parliamentary polls.        
	The Trinamul Congress leaders move to cap the violence and bring her movement back on normal course came to focus when she ordered Trinamul youth leaders to divert an unruly procession heading towards the chief ministers Palm Avenue house towards Esplanade area. She wanted the rallyists to attend a rally of primary teachers she would address there.         
	The change of course followed the governors statement in the afternoon, which underlined the court order that asks the government to ban two-stroke autos, need for a constructive attitude from every quarter and the urgency to enable Calcutta to breathe clean air.         
	The leader of the Opposition in the Assembly, Trinamuls Partha Chatterjee, later said: We respect the judiciary. Like others, we, too, want clean air. But Mamatas objection is to the way the government is hammering those poor people (auto owners and drivers) into compliance. She wants a solution through talks.        
	However, the Left Front is far from convinced. Referring to Mamatas blockade near the chief ministers house last night, front chairman Biman Bose said: She displayed a perverted culture by squatting in front of the chief ministers house.        
	A significant section of Trinamul felt last nights roadblock and todays violence might recoil on the party. Some leaders, it is believed, tried to tell her that Trinamul would be seen as disrespecting the court or being insensitive to the citys crying need for clean air.         
	They had been brushed aside yesterday as Mamata decided to take her crusade to Buddhadeb Bhattacharjees home.        
	In doing so, she thought she would peel away an important support base from the CPM, which banks on the army of auto operators during elections.         
	Madan Mitra, her Man Friday and aspiring MLA, collected the crowd. Shobhandeb Chattopadhyay, who heads Trinamuls labour wing and is on the margin in the leader-heavy Kalighat area  the seat of Trinamul power  jumped in.         
	Most of the important Trinamul leaders chose not to stop the two who had held several meetings with transport minister Subhas Chakraborty over the past few weeks and apparently pledged support for the clean-air drive.

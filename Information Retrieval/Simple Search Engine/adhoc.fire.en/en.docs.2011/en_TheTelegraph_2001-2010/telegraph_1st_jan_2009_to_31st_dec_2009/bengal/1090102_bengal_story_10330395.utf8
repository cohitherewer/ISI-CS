          OUR CORRESPONDENT                               
	Alipurduar, Jan. 1: A 33-year-old man committed suicide after strangulating his wife to death ending a strained relationship last night. The couple have left behind a three-year-old daughter and a four-month-old son.        
	Ramesh Roy of Chepani village in Samuktala had married Kanika (25) of Daldali in Khoardanga four years ago.        
	Local people alleged that the seller of lottery tickets used to torture his wife and even did not allow her to talk to neighbours. Recently, Kanika had spent a month with her parents apparently because of the torture, but returned to Chepani two months ago.        
	Yesterday, Ramesh told me that he would take a house on rent in Alipurduar town (20km away). I objected to the move so did Kanika, as she was afraid of more torture there. This annoyed him and he did not talk to his wife at night, said Minati Roy, the youths mother. Early this morning, I woke up hearing the cries of their daughter Uma. When I went to their room, I saw Kanikas body lying on the floor. After a while, neighbours spotted Rameshs body hanging from a mango tree behind our house.         
	Basudeb Sarkar, the officer-in-charge of Samuktala police station, said Ramesh had strangulated his wife to death and then hanged himself from the tree. We came to know that the youth used to torture his wife but nobody informed us about it, otherwise we could have advised and the incident could have been avoided.

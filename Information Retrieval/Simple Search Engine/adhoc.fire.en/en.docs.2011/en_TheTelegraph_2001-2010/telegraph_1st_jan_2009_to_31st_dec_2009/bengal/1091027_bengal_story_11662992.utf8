The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Mamatas probe push
                                                                                                               Mamatas probe push

	Oct. 26: Mamata Banerjee today said the demand for a CBI probe into allegations of corruption against the Visva-Bharati vice-chancellor was justified.        
	The universitys non-teaching staff, teachers, and even students have all joined hands to press the demand for a CBI probe. Their unions are elected bodies and their demand is justified. The people against whom the allegations have been levelled should come clean, Mamata said without naming VC Rajat Kanta Ray.        
	Classes were not held for the third day today. The Visva-Bharati is Bengals pride and I want the Centre to intervene to restore its lost glory, the Trinamul leader added.        
	State Congress leader Subrata Mukherjee had visited Santiniketan and threatened to launch a sit-in in front of the governors house demanding Rays resignation.        
	The university has promised the agitators that it will seek a central probe into their charges but not sent any such request to Delhi yet.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Party attack on station
                                                                                                               Party attack on station
                            
	Serampore, Aug. 26: Supp-orters of the CPM youth wing went on the rampage at Serampore station today after be- ing told to clear out because leaflets they were distributing were littering the premises.        
	The DYFI gang dragged stationmaster Narayan Chandra Das to his room, 50 metres away, smashed windowpanes, telephones, flowerpots and furniture, and squatted on the tracks for an hour and a half from 5pm. Nearly 14,000 passengers were stranded at various points on the Howrah-Burdwan line.        
	The leaflets being distributed at the station, 30km from Calcutta, alleged that the station authorities had hoisted the Trinamul flag instead of the Tricolour on August 15.        
	Mamata Banerjee alleged that it was a planned attack by the CPM because she was the railway minister. They are out of their minds after losing the polls. If I go and set fire to Writers, will that be good?

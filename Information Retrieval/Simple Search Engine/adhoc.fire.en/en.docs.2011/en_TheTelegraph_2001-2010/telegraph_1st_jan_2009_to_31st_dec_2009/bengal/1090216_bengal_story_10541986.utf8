                                                                                                               Bullets fly in school poll clash
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Tamluk, Feb. 15: A CPM supporter was shot dead and two Trinamul Congress supporters were injured in a clash over a school election in East Midnapore this evening.        
	The CPM has been in control of the managing committee at Bamunbar Girls High School for seven years, but after sweeping the rural polls in the district last year, Trinamul decided to back candidates for all six seats on the panel.         
	The clash started when counting was about to begin at the school in Patashpur, 175km from Calcutta.        
	A bullet in his chest, Subodh Barik, 39, was killed on the spot. Ramkrishna Maity, 35, a member of the Trinamul gram panchayat, and Nabakumar Samanta, 32, were injured. They were referred to a Calcutta hospital from Midnapore because their condition was serious.        
	District police chief Pallab Kanti Ghosh said the clash took place about 500 metres from the school.        
	Subodh was a resident of Arjunnagar in adjoining Bhagabanpur block. The party has called a 12-hour bandh in the block tomorrow. Trinamul was trying to capture the committee by unleashing terror. They shot our man, said Bishnupada Manna, a CPM zonal committee secretary.        
	Trinamul accused the CPM of terrorising its voters. They had been intimidating our sympathisers. After the election this evening, they attacked our supporters. Barik was killed by his own party men, said district Trinamul president Sisir Adhikary.        
	The counting in the school was held amid heavy security. The CPM retained the panel, winning all six seats.

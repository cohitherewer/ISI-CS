The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Lalgarh demands Maoist amnesty
                                                                                                               Lalgarh demands Maoist amnesty
  - Drop all cases since 1998, says leader        OUR BUREAU               
	April 19: The tribals of Lalgarh want the government to drop all cases against suspected Maoists since 1998 as a condition for allowing police into their area for 12 hours on election day.         
	That is not all, though. They also want former West Midnapore superintendent of police Rajesh Singh to go to Dalilpurchak in the heart of Lalgarh and apologise for atrocities in the wake of the mine blast on the chief ministers route last November and stop atrocities on tribal women in the name of raids.        
	After a meeting yesterday, the Peoples Committee Against Police Atrocities had mentioned the demand for the former district police chiefs apology but not what is potentially the killer clause: dropping cases.         
	Its leader Chhatradhar Mahato had said: Policemen will have to leave the booths with the polling personnel after voting. They will not be allowed to patrol the villages. Our police boycott will continue from the day after the polls.        
	Today, Mahato told a gathering of some 15,000 people in Jhargram town: We have prioritised three of the 23 demands we had made earlier. We have already sent our three demands to the Election Commission and the state government. We are awaiting their response.        
	The poll panel and the state government had earlier ruled out holding the elections in Lalgarh without the police.        
	Chief electoral officer Debashis Sen said he had received the faxed message. We will discuss the matter with the state. The objective is to have peaceful elections everywhere and that includes Lalgarh.        
	Maoists are believed to be holding the reins of the Lalgarh protests.         
	Among other things, the protesters had yesterday wanted Rs 6 lakh and government jobs for the families of six committee members found dead recently. They also wanted Rs 3 lakh for Chhitamoni Murmu, a woman whom a policeman had allegedly hit with a rifle butt in the eye during the raids last November.        
	The tribal leadership had yesterday said it would allow the police in if the government gave its demands a sympathetic hearing.         
	At Jhargram, about 160km from Calcutta, Mahato said: Subhasbabu (transport minister Subhas Chakraborty) had threatened to thrash me and put me in jail for being anti-national. Im going to his doorstep (for a rally on Friday) and I dare him to arrest me.

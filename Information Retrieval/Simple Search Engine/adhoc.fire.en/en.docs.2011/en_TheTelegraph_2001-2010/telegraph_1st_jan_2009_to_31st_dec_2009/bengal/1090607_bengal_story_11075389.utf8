	June 6: The state government is working overtime to put a figure to the losses suffered when cyclone Aila hissed through Bengal on May 25 to buttress its demand for a Rs 1,000-crore aid from Delhi.         
	At an emergency meeting in the Gosaba block office this evening, senior officials and panchayat chiefs were busy tabulating the damage in an area where life and property had taken the worst hit.         
	A central team will visit the area tomorrow to assess the losses and we are preparing a full account of the impact of the cyclone on this block. We have received an instruction from Writers Buildings to prepare foolproof reports on the devastation, a senior block official told The Telegraph late into the evening.         
	The Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee government has also requested the Centre to consider Aila a national calamity.         
	As the 12 central officials who arrived in Calcutta this afternoon will have a say on the actual aid granted, the state government is leaving no stone unturned to make them feel comfortable during their stay till Tuesday.         
	All of them will be put up in a five-start hotel in Calcutta between their tours of the three districts (North and South 24-Parganas and Darjeeling) in these two-and-a-half days. It is the state governments responsibility to organise hospitality for them. All expenses will be borne by our government, said finance minister Asim Dasgupta, who had tabled the states Rs 1,000-crore demand in Delhi.         
	With Mamata Banerjee opposing the state governments demand and urging the Centre to channel the money directly to the panchayats, the Rs 1,000-crore aid has become a prestige issue for the beleaguered Bhattacharjee government. It has so far got Rs 100 crore as immediate relief.         
	Asoke Lavasa, a joint secretary in the Union home ministry, is leading the Delhi 12.         
	Three members of the team headed to Darjeeling this afternoon while nine others went to Writers and met state home secretary Ardhendu Sen and other senior officials.         
	After the meeting, the nine left for Dhamakhali and Sandeshkhali in the North 24-Parganas.         
	Five of them will return to Calcutta tonight and set out for Gosaba in South 24-Parganas tomorrow morning, said an official in the state home department.         
	The Delhi team reached a relief camp at Sarberia High school in Sandeshkhali around 5.30pm and enquired about the availability of relief materials.        
	Later, they crossed a tributary of the Bidyadhari and went to some of the makeshift relief camps in the Sandeshkhali II gram panchayat area. Four members of the team put up in a guest house in Taki, about 70km north of Calcutta, for the night.         
	We have visited very few camps and are not in a position to comment on the damage. We are yet to get a complete picture of the relief measures taken, said Lavasa.

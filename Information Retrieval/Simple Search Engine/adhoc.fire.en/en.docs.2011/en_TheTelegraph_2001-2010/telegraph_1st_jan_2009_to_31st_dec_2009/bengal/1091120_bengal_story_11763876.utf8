	Midnapore, Nov. 19: Suspected Maoists shot dead a ration dealer about 25km from Midnapore town last night.        
	Bhanguram Hansdas son saw two men with rifles slung across their shoulders and alerted him but it was too late by then. The duo were already in their courtyard.        
	They insisted on my father joining them for a meeting. When he resisted, they dragged him away by the collar. About a dozen others were waiting outside our house, said Bhangurams son Jageswar.         
	Bhanguram, 50, a CPM supporter, had been a panchayat member many years ago.        
	We heard gunshots soon after the gang took my father away, but we did not dare step out of home, said Jageswar, 20. The residents of Bhadulia village, about 40km from Lalgarh, found him riddled with bullets this morning a stones throw from his home.        
	The police said the Maoists killed Bhanguram possibly because he had refused to pay them extortion money. He is the sixth West Midnapore ration dealer allegedly killed by Maoists this year.

                                                                                                               Bullets cut short run to river for life 
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                          Debabrata Biswal                                  
	Howrah, Feb. 21: A real estate promoter who had gone to cremate a friend was shot dead on the banks of the Hooghly before he could jump into the river to escape his assailants.        
	When the five youths came on three bikes and shot Debabrata Biswal around 1.30pm, the 35-year-old was waiting for his friends ashes at the Shibpur crematorium, on the banks of the river.        
	Debabrata, who had the reputation of a local tough, was known as Ure Gopal in Dasnagar, about 40km from the city, where he lived.         
	The five killers headed straight for Debabrata on reaching the crematorium.         
	Hearing the sound of bikes, Debabrata turned. One of his friends said there was horror on his face when he saw them.        
	Debabrata turned and ran towards the ghat, about 100m from where he was standing.        
	Seeing him run, the youths, believed to be in their twenties, pulled out their guns and pursued him.        
	The chase lasted two minutes. Debabrata was about 20ft from the ghat when the first bullet slammed into him. The youth who was closest to him fired a few rounds.         
	Debabrata, once a football player of some repute in Howrah, slumped to the ground.         
	One bullet had pierced his back and come out from the front, damaging his heart.         
	The five turned, walked to their bikes and sped away as people at the crematorium stood stunned and scared.         
	It was over in a couple of minutes, said Sanjay Gupta, who had come for another funeral.         
	After the shooting, the five walked back to their motorcycles, at a distance of about 150m, and none of us had the courage to do anything, he said.        
	One of Debabratas friends wrapped him in a piece of cloth, picked him up and brought him to the crematorium gate. He was looking for a car to take him to hospital, Sanjay said. Then someone told him not to get involved as this was a police case. So, he put the man on the ground in front of the gate, Sanjay said.        
	The police took Debabrata to Howrah district hospital where he was declared dead. They said business rivalry could be the reason behind the murder.         
	Police sources said Debabrata was involved in extortions that helped him consolidate his business in nearby Alampur. He had a criminal record and we believe he was killed over a dispute regarding his business, a police officer said.        
	A murder case has been started. No one has been arrested yet.

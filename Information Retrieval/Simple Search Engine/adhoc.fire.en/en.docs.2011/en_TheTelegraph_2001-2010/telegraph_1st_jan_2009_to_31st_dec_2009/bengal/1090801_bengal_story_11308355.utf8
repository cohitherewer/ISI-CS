The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Guns blaze in Lalgarh search
                                                                                                               Guns blaze in Lalgarh search
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                                            
	Midnapore, July 31: Paramilitary forces scanning Jhitka forest in search of two policemen allegedly kidnapped by Maoists in Lalgarh fought the guerrillas through the day and apparently hit some of them.         
	But the state police constables who went missing yesterday remained untraced.        
	Two of the rebels are be- lieved to have been killed but none of the bodies were found. Home secretary Ardhendu Sen said in Calcutta: There was a heavy exchange of fire. I have unconfirmed reports that two Maoists were killed in the encounter.        
	Police arrested a man with a bullet wound in Jhargram town and said he was a guerrilla brought there for treatment from an encounter site nearly 30km away.        
	A combined force of the CRPF, BSF and the states Eastern Frontier Rifles launched todays operation following a tip-off that the constables could be somewhere in the forest near Bhulagera, a village about 10km south of Bhimpur.        
	Two teams, each with 100 personnel armed with au- tomatic rifles, carbines and light machine guns, went into the forest from Pirakata and Bhimpur. They met around 8.30 in the densest part of Jhitka, where the forces had not entered before.         
	There, bullets flew at them from behind sal trees. The jawans hit back and a fierce exchange followed for about two hours. Around 10.30, the firing stopped from the other end and we realised the guerrillas had retreated deeper into the jungle, an officer said.        
	Crouching behind trees for cover, the jawans inched forward. The hostages could be in the primary school at Bhulagera, about 1.5km away, their informer had said. It could also be a trap.        
	On the edge of the forest, where a large paddy field separated the force from the village, officers leading the operation could see on their binoculars men with rifles lying on their bellies at a distance.         
	Around 10.45, four impro-vised explosive devices went off, but the forces marched on and the rebels retreated further. When the jawans entered the village at 12.30pm, there was neither any sign of the Maoists nor their hostages. The village was deserted, its residents having fled in fear.         
	Around this time, a 100-strong reinforcement arrived from Dharampur after battling rebels on the way. Their experience showed how the guerrillas in the region take no time to return to a forest stretch scanned by the forces.        
	In June, the CRPFs elite Cobra unit had sanitised the roadside jungles through which the forces moved into Lalgarh from Bhimpur.        
	A fourth group had an hour-long encounter with the rebels in a forest near Ramgarh and a fifth near Dharampur.        
	West Midnapore superintendent of police Manoj Verma said: We are yet to find constables Kanchan Giri and Sahib Mollah. We have arrested from a Jhargram hospital a man who was with the Maoists at Bhulagera and was hit by a bullet in the upper abdomen.         
	The alleged Maoist, Lakshmikanta Hembram, was referred to Midnapore Medical College and Hospital this evening. A Lalgarh resident accompanying him has been detained.        
	A police officer refused to admit they had walked into a trap. Had it been a trap, our route would have been pockmarked with mines.        
	The Peoples Committee Against Police Atrocities said Lakshmikanta had nothing to do with the Maoists. He was grazing cows when he was hit by the bullet. More villagers may have been injured, said leader Chhatradhar Mahato.

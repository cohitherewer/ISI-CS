The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Development despair in CPM   Rug off feet, blame on US
                                                                                                               Development despair in CPM
   Rug off feet, blame on US          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Biman Bose and Nirupam Sen: Crying conspiracy                                       
	Calcutta, Sept. 15: The Siliguri verdict has proved that the development plank cant win elections, feels the CPM.        
	Battered by the winds of change sweeping across Bengal since last years rural polls, CPM state secretary Biman Bose said: Its now clear that development cant ensure everything (read poll victory). There was enough development in Siliguri.         
	We need to know the details to explain why this (the Siliguri debacle) happened, he added after a rally organised by the CPM student and youth wings in Calcutta.         
	Bose, also the Left Front chairman, described the res- ult as unexpected and said Opposition unity was one of the factors that opened to Mamata Banerjee the doors to north Bengal, considered her weak link until yesterday.        
	The internal assessment of the Left and the CPM, likely to come up at the front meeting tomorrow and the party state committee meeting on Thursday, may throw up many local as well as state-level factors.        
	Chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee, who had been making subtle confessions recently about his governments mistakes and misgivings  apparently to stave off anti-incumbency  was not present at the rally today.        
	But neither Bose nor Nirupam Sen, the party politburo member and ideologue on industrialisation, offered any self-critical assessment of the sliding support while speaking at the youth forum. Instead, both trained their guns on the terror of the Trinamul-Maoist combine, the Congress and the media, not to mention the imperialist US.                   
	They complained of a grand anti-communist conspiracy abetted and aided by US imperialists, which is out to unseat the Left in Bengal and wreck their opposition to reforms based on Washington consensus at the national level.        
	To industries minister Sen, the demand for power at every home today instead of the cry for food 50 years ago signifies the development accomplished by the Left in its 32-year rule. But he blamed the Opposition-media nexus for confusing the voters.         
	There is no upper limit for development and peoples expectations. Now the misgivings on development are being used against us. The Opposition prevented us from setting up industry. Now it is being said that development will not be possible as long as Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee is in Writers Buildings, he said.         
	Some people always get confused by misinformation campaigns, but only for some time. We have to convince the people. There is no easy alternative. We have a hard and harsh road ahead, he told party youths, some of whose leaders today exhorted them to resist the forces of anarchy out to kill us with jhandas (flags) and dandas (sticks).        
	Bose complained that the killing of CPM supporters in the Lalgarh region and elsewhere was being funded by US imperialists.         
	These forces are prescribing the killing of Left cadres and supporters and the executioners are getting further money after submitting utilisation certificates, he said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Teenager abducted on way to tuition
                                                                                                               Teenager abducted on way to tuition
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Malda, Oct. 18: The 18 sons of an alleged local mafia don are suspected to be behind the abduction of a 17-year-old from a village in Maldas Ratua.        
	Friends had seen the Class XI girl being dragged down from her cycle and shoved into a car on the way to English tuition on Thursday.        
	On Friday, her mother received a call demanding Rs 3 lakh as ransom. Her father is a farmer at Pukuria village, about 45km from Malda town.        
	After drawing a blank for three days, Malda police have turned to their counterparts in Bihar, suspecting that the girl had been taken there.        
	An officer said she had probably been taken to Amdabad in adjacent Katihar district. Sheikh Musihar and his 18 sons, who are always on motorcycles and extorting money and robbing people, are behind the abduction, a senior district officer said.        
	After the abduction, he said, the police had raided a house in Harishchandrapur  about 25km from Pukuria  where the goons were suspected to be hiding. The village is on the banks of the Fulahar and across the river is Katihar. It was easy for the gang to have taken the girl by boat to the other side, the officer added.        
	The girls father, Rafikul Islam, said other students had seen her being forced into the car 2km from Pukuria. Her cycle was lying on the roadside. Nearly 40 students go to Araidanga, 5km away, for tuition everyday. My daughter used to go with three others. But that day, none of them was with her, Islam said.         
	District police chief Bhuban Mondal said: We have identified the gang. A team is going to Bihar.         
	The residents of Pukuria are furious. The police know about Musihar and his sons who rape, murder and rob people. But they have a free run in the area, said a villager.        
	The goons had recently shot at a former CPM panchayat leader of Ratua who had tried to organise resistance against them at Kahala, a village where Musihar lived earlier. But the police are afraid of Musihar, a villager said.        
	The district police chief admitted that over a dozen cases were pending against Musihar and his sons.

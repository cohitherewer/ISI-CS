The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Mike virus traced to PWD
                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      Mike virus traced to PWD
          KINSUK BASU                              
	Calcutta, Dec. 2: The sound system installed in the Assembly on November 24 had not been put on trial even once until the Speaker wanted to see if it was working on Sunday, the eve of the winter session.        
	The PWD secretary admitted today that the fault for the acoustic failure that forced a nine-day adjournment of the House yesterday lay more with his department than the company that had designed the system. The company is definitely accountable. But there is no denying slackness on our part in both supervision and monitoring of the system that was installed. There is no point passing the buck. Everyone knew when the session would commence, Ajit Ranjan Bardhan told The Telegraph.        
	The PWD minister had yesterday blamed a software virus for the malfunctioning mikes and threatened to throw the company (that installed the system) out if it could not get them ready in 10 days.        
	A three-member panel has been formed to probe, among other things, the carelessness on the part of PWD and Bosch officials. It will submit its report within a fortnight.         
	Bosch has been asked to submit its own report. We are going to examine the extent to which our officials as well as those of the company were slack, a PWD official said.         
	Boschs country manager Satadal Chattopadhayay said: I wont make any comment. An inquiry is on.        
	The company has handled similar projects in several states and at Vigyan Bhawan, a PWD official said. A preliminary probe has found that the virus has corrupted one of a hardware device which pulled the whole system down.

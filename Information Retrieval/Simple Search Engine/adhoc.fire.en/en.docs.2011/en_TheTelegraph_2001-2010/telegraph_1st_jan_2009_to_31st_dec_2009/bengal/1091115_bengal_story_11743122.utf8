                                                                        Sunday , November 15 , 2009                                                                                                                                                                                              CA student crushed at Metro 
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Calcutta, Nov. 14: A girl studying chartered accountancy was crushed to death by a Metro train at Girish Park, prompting police to suspect suicide but her family raised the possibility of an accident arising from a medical condition.        
	Sujata Mehta, 22, died after coming under the wheels of a Dum Dum-bound train at 9.57am.         
	How the girl fell on the tracks is not clear. Initially, the death was considered a suicide  which occurs once in a while on the Metro tracks.         
	However, once the girls identity was established after 11 hours and the police contacted her family, another element was added.         
	The family told the police that Sujatas head reeled sometimes and she was taking medicines for it. A pharmacy bill found in Sujatas book had helped the police trace her family.        
	If it is established that dizziness was behind the fall, the death will be the first accidental fatality on the Metro tracks.         
	The police have said circumstantial evidence points to suicide. We are waiting for the post-mortem report to find out the exact cause of death, said an official of Girish Park police station. But he added that the post-mortem was unlikely to establish if the girl felt dizzy or not before the fall.        
	A few months ago, a youth allegedly jumped in front of a Metro train. He survived and his family later said he was suffering from high blood pressure because of which he might have fallen off the platform.         
	Sujatas father Ranjit Kumar Mehta, an accountant in a plywood shop on CR Avenue, told the police that the CA final student studied at an institute in Chowringhee. We have no idea what led to her death, Mehta said.        
	He said his daughter had a digestion problem because of which her head would spin sometimes.         
	Sujata left her three-storey Baguiati home around 8.30am today. Stations at Dum Dum and Belgachhia are closer to her home but she used to go to a friends house at Girish Park, family sources said.        
	The girl was carrying a leather bag that was partially crushed under the wheels.         
	The police came across the name Sujata Mehta in an accountancy book found near the body. The bill of the medical store, located in Baguiati, was kept in the book.        
	A team from Girish Park police station visited the shop. Fayyaz Ahmed, officer-in-charge of the police station, said: We contacted our counterparts in Baguiati and the medicine shop as well. The shop owner said he did not know any Sujata Mehta.        
	The police then visited the shop and asked if the shop owner knew anyone with a Mehta surname. That worked and we traced the victims house, said an officer.

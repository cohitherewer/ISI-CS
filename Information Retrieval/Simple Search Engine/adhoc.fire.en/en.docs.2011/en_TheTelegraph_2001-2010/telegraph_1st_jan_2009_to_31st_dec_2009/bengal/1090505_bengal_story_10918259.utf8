The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Hooch tragedy in trophy seat
                                                                                                               Hooch tragedy in trophy seat
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Tamluk, May 4: At least 10 people have died after consuming illicit liquor in Tamluk, the tragedy unfolding three days before the elections in the Lok Sabha seat that includes Nandigram.        
	As many as 150 people have been admitted to hospitals overwhelmed by the sudden rush of patients. Initial reports suggested that 10 villages have been affected in Tamluk in East Midnapore.        
	The chief medical officer of the district, Rabikinkar Nayek, said the death toll could rise. We expect the death toll to rise as more cases are being reported, Nayek said.         
	Late tonight, panchayat officials submitted a list of 10 casualties to the district administration, which said the names were being verified.        
	Sources said the victims consumed the illicit liquor from three shops at Ramtarakhat, a marketplace near the cluster of 10 villages. Farm hands and rickshaw van operators frequent these shops, which are supplied by illegal distilleries at Moyna in East Midnapore and Shyampur in Howrah, the sources said.        
	Enraged women armed with sticks and brooms attacked the three illicit liquor shops. As the toll mounted, the women returned and set the shops on fire.        
	Coming a few hours before campaigning ends tomorrow for the second phase of the elections in Bengal, the tragedy appeared to be turning into a political issue.         
	Most of the affected villages are said to be dominated by supporters of the Trinamul Congress, which is smelling victory in the Tamluk seat that is now held by the CPMs Haldia strongman, Lakshman Seth.         
	The Tamluk contest is hogging eyeballs because Nandigram, which has become the central theme of the elections in the state, is part of the constituency.        
	CPM candidate Seth was heckled when he looked up some of the victims in a hospital.         
	It is our people who have died after drinking the poisoned liquor. What have you done to stop the menace of spurious liquor? Nothing, said Alpana Ghara, 25, a resident of Hogolberia, whose father Purnachandra Bar, 65, a farm labourer, fell ill after drinking this afternoon.        
	Seth said that the incident was unfortunate. We will have to stop the menace. Villagers also stop drinking liquor, he added.        
	Subhendu Adhikary, the Trinamul candidate, visited the hospital and blamed the government. The government is solely responsible for the tragedy. Policemen are in league with those who supply the spurious liquor, said Adhikary.         
	The administration has failed to stop this racket. Our husbands and sons would not have died or fallen ill if the shops were raided and sealed by the government, said Anima Maity, 30, whose husband was admitted to hospital.        
	This is the third hooch tragedy to strike the state this year. In January, 28 people had died in Garden Reach in Calcutta. In the same month, six people were killed after consuming spurious liquor in Maheshtala.        
	Finance minister Asim Dasgupta had then vowed to launch a crackdown against illicit liquor and raids were conducted for some time.

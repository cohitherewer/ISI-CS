                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      Bloc blames Buddha for slide
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Calcutta, Dec. 11: The Forward Bloc holds the CPM and the pro-capitalist Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee government responsible for the Lefts shrinking support base.         
	A draft political resolution prepared for next weeks party congress says: Pro-capitalist policies, dual approaches on policy matters (and) forcible acquisition of cultivable land for industrial purposes are generating anti-Left feelings among people. The document underlines the Lefts stagnation nationally and withering of its impact in Bengal.         
	Representatives of both the CPM and the CPI have been invited to address the five-day congress in Calcutta beginning December 17.         
	The CPM admits that land acquisition has alienated it from a section of farmers and has asked the government to do a course correction, but it has refused to throw the baby out with the bath water.         
	According to the Bloc, the Left rule in Bengal had initially drawn the countrys attention because of its successes in land reforms and panchayati raj and for being able to avert communal and casteist strife, but the impact... started withering away after the same state submitted to capitalist globalisation.        
	While it blames Nandigram for the serious alienation of a section of Muslim peasants, it holds the state government and the CPM responsible for losing the faith of tribals and making way for Maoists. The pertinent question (is) why a strong citadel of the Left has turned into a Maoist liberated zone? Why has the government failed to address the grievances of the tribal people? the resolution asks.        
	It describes the state administration as lethargic and says its incapability to provide innovative... welfare schemes for the poor created serious doubts among the people about the commitment of the Left government.

                                                                                                               Delhi gives Rs 478cr for Aila repairs 
  1000cr in budget for dykes: Asim          OUR BUREAU                      A man tries to rebuild his Aila-struck house in the Sunderbans   with whatever is left of it. File picture                                 
	Calcutta, July 7: The Centre has sanctioned Rs 478 crore from its national calamity fund for Aila relief over and above the money promised in yesterdays budget.         
	State finance minister Asim Dasgupta said the Rs 1,000-crore allocation proposed by Pranab Mukherjee was meant for construction of concrete embankments and the money sanctioned today for immediate repair and rebuilding jobs.        
	Thousands of kilometres of mud-built, temporary embankments were washed away or breached when cyclone Aila ravaged south Bengal on May 25 and hissed north, leaving a trail of death and destruction. Over 65 lakh people were affected and 138 killed.        
	The CPM-led Bengal government thanked the Congress-led Centre for releasing the relief money in very quick time.        
	I had a detailed talk with Union finance minister Pranab Mukherjee about the funds we got today, Dasgupta said.         
	They were re- leased in very quick time after Aila. We thank the Prime Minister, Union home minister and particularly the Union finance minister for this.        
	Mamata Banerjee had pleaded with the Centre not to channel the aid through the state government. She wanted the money to go directly to the panchayats  PM to DM  many of which are in Trinamul Congress control now.        
	The Centre, however, has ruled that out citing the Constitution.                   Asim Dasgupta      
	Dasgupta said: Our basic idea is to construct concrete, permanent embankments and that would require about Rs 10,000 crore. So a budgetary provision of Rs 1,000 crore on this account is just a small beginning. We will talk to the Centre to explore ways to raise this huge amount of resource that would be necessary for embankment building.         
	The Rs 478 crore for which Writers Buildings received the sanction letter today is part of the Rs 1,000 crore the state had sought from the National Calamity and Contingency Fund. This immediate job includes repairing and rebuilding homes and roads, making arrangements for drinking water where tube wells were damaged, and erecting temporary embankments in places that might get flooded again during high tide.        
	We will get the money in a day or two, Dasgupta said.        
	The state today sent a district-specific estimate to the Centre about the damage to plead for the remaining Rs 522 crore. I thanked him (Pranab Mukherjee) for his co-operation and also sent him an estimate that calls for sanction of a second instalment of Rs 522 crore. That would fulfil our demand for funds from the national calamity fund, Dasgupta said.         
	He added that the state was likely to borrow money from banks to generate the remaining Rs 9,000 crore needed for permanent embankments.        
	Sunderbans minister Kanti Ganguly today proposed in the Assembly that an all-party panel be formed to save the Hooghly delta from calamities like Aila. Let us go to Delhi together, meet the central ministers concerned and seek funds to deal with a crisis like this in the future, he said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Mamata on Congress wings

	Calcutta, May 5: The election results on May 16 will tell if the Opposition alliance has really taken off in Bengal but the Congress has already hi- red a machine to keep Mamata Banerjee flying high.        
	The Congress high command has rented a private Pawan Hans helicopter that flies the Trinamul Congress chief as well as Congress central leaders to their campaign destinations almost everyday.        
	The party, which allied with Trinamul in March, foots the chopper bill  Rs 1 lakh for each hour  as Mamata tours the interiors of Bengal.         
	We have reserved a private helicopter for Pranabda (Pranab Mukherjee) and other VIPs campaigning in Bengal. Mamataji must be using the same copter to cover the far-flung districts, said K. Keshava Rao, the Congress general secretary in charge of Bengal.        
	State Congress leaders have no say on where the blue-and-red four-seater should fly. The high command decides it.         
	A senior state Congress leader said: The helicopter is sometimes parked in the hangar at the Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose airport. Sometimes, it is sent to us from places like Bhubaneswar or Guwahati where it stays according to the requirements of leaders.        
	The party spends a lot on the helicopter, the Congress leader said. A days campaigning could cost Rs 7-8 lakh.        
	Mamatas party is pleased with the Congresss gesture. Now Didi can go to far-flung areas. The chopper is of great help as she is our biggest campaigner, Trinamul state president Subrata Bakshi said.         
	The party could not have afforded to hire a helicopter, Bakshi added. It would have been really difficult for Mamatadi to campaign in remote districts had she not been provided with the chopper.         
	Before Mamata boarded the Congress flying machine, she had the BJP chopper.        
	That too was a Pawan Hans and then, as now, the Delhi ally foot the bill.         
	BJP spokesperson S.S. Ahluwalia said: We had provided a helicopter to Mamataji in 2006. She had accompanied our leader Arun Jaitley to rural Bengal while campaigning for the Assembly elections.         
	Mamata first used the Congresss helicopter when she toured north Bengal with Mukherjee. On April 23, she took the copter to Hooghly, Burdwan and Birbhum. On April 26, she again flew to Burdwan.         
	When Rahul Gandhi came to Bengal on Saturday, he flew the same chopper to Behrampore from Domkol in Murshidaband, Congress sources said.        
	But the chopper could not fly Mamata to Krishnagar on Sunday. The Congress was not to blame. It was a norwester.

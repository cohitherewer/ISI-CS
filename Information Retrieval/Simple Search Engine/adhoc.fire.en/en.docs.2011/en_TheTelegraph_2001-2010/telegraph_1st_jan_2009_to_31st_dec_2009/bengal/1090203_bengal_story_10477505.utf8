The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Haldia Petro foes together
                                                                                                               Haldia Petro foes together
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Calcutta, Feb. 2: The labour crisis at Bengals showpiece project, Haldia Petrochemicals, today brought its warring promoters together for a show of unity.        
	The Chatterjee Group (TCG) chairman Purnendu Chatterjee and West Bengal Industrial Development Corporation MD Subrata Gupta landed at the Haldia plant around 11.30 this morning, apparently to boost the sagging morale of employees.        
	After almost five hours with executives, Chatterjee left for Calcutta at 4.45pm, but Gupta stayed back. I was planning to go to Haldia to see how work on (expansion) Project Supermax was progressing. Chatterjee called up and said hed like to join me. So we decided to go together, Gupta said tonight.        
	Their visit comes close on the heels of a Citu-sponsored labour trouble that brought the plant to the brink of closure over the weekend. Intervention by top government functionaries had averted the shutdown.        
	While neither admitted that the situation was alarming, Chatterjees statement late this evening left little to imagination. People in HPL and those associated with HPL are going through difficult times and we should all work together to sort out the difficulties.        
	TCG sources said Chatterjee referred to both the labour trouble and the economic downturn that had hit HPL hard.        
	The visit sparked a buzz on whether the two promoters, bickering over HPLs control for a decade, were coming closer. Its too premature to comment. The fact is that the case is now in the Supreme Court, Gupta said.        
	TCG sources said: He (Chatterjee) had not gone to the plant for a long time. He was here and decided to go.        
	Industry circles also wondered whether Chatterjees visit had anything to do with his interest in the Nayachar chemical hub. In the past, TCG had expressed interest in building a refinery at Haldia.

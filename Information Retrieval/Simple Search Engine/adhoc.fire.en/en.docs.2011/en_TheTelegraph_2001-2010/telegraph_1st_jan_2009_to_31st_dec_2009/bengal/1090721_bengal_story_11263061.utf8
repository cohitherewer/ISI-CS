	Midnapore, July 20: Child- ren made to march in front of a Lalgarh procession today got sandwiched between some 10,000 Maoist-backed protesters and a wall of police.         
	The baton charge that followed left at least half a dozen of them bruised.         
	The Peoples Committee Against Police Atrocities had used the schoolchildren as a human shield in the push for withdrawal of security forces from a village 12km from Lalgarh where they have been camping in a high school.        
	Women formed the second tier of the procession and bore the brunt. Five of them are in hospital with broken arms and head injuries. Two others were allowed to return home with stitches on their head.        
	A villager said parents were threatened with kangaroo court trials  where Maoists usually pronounce the death sentence  if they did not send their children for the march to Gohomidanga High School. Committee members told us last night our children must be in front, said a man whose daughter is in Class VIII.         
	They told us tomorrow we will drive the forces away and take control of the school. We would have been tried in a peoples court had we not sent our children.         
	Around 11am, some 700 children, many of them in school uniform, assembled about a kilometre from Gohomidanga along with 10,000 adults carrying traditional tribal weapons.        
	The students were asked to keep a distance of about 100 metres from the main procession and given cardboard placards saying go back police, give back our school.         
	Around 300 central and state police personnel have been staying in the school building since July 1.         
	As the students neared its gate, the police asked them to stop. But the students tried to push ahead and some of them caught the gates iron grilles and started shaking it.        
	When 100-odd personnel  both men and women  tried to push the students back, they could not because the large mass of committee supporters had closed in behind them.        
	Then stones were hurled from behind, three policemen were hit and the deputy superintendent in charge of the camp ordered the lathicharge.         
	The crowd dispersed, but the villagers soon regrouped and re-emerged, hurling stones at the police. The lathicharge resumed.         
	During the clash, some of the villagers rushed to block the road between Dharampur and Brindabanpur so reinforcements could not be brought in from Lalgarh town.        
	Around 1.30pm, the villagers left the school for a place 2km away where committee member Sundar Mandi addressed them. We are taking an oath. We will drive out the forces from the area, even if there is bloodshed, Mandi said.        
	In Calcutta, home secretary Ardhendu Sen described the lathicharge on students as very unfortunate and expressed regrets. There was a mild lathicharge on students in Lalgarh today and thats very unfortunate. We are very sorry for that, he said.        
	West Midnapore police chief Manoj Verma said the cops had no option but to resort to the baton charge. Stones were raining on us. Our efforts to persuade them to disperse had failed.        
	Asked why the police did not use tear gas, Verma said: We did not want to use it on the children. The villagers were using them as a shield.        
	A Class X student who was hit on the back said: The police should understand why we came today. Dont they know who forced us to march?        
	A week ago, nearly 600 students had marched to the Gohomidanga school demanding that the forces be withdrawn. Villagers said the protest, which began spontaneously among the students, was later hijacked by the Maoists and their sympathisers.         
	The home secretary iterated that the police camps in schools in the area would be vacated by July-end. Four permanent camps to relocate the police are ready. Another eight will be coming up in the next few days. We are also trying to find out if the police can be moved out of schools during the day and brought back when classes close.        
	Sen said the police action in Lalgarh would continue. Going by the experience in other Naxalite-hit states, its not possible to wind up the operation in a month or two.        
	Jawans scanning the Bankishole forest, 30km from Gohomidanga, were ambushed tonight. No casualties were reported but the gun battle raged for an hour. The jawans defused four explosive devices planted on their way.

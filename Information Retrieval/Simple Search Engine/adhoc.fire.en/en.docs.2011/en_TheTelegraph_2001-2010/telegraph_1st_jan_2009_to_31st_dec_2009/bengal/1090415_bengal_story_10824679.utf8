The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Decision on Lalgarh police put off
                                                                                                               Decision on Lalgarh police put off
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                          The Peoples Committee meeting in Lalgarh on Tuesday . Picture by Swarup Mondal                                   
	Lalgarh, April 14: The tribal leadership today deferred a decision on whether to allow police into Lalgarh for the April 30 polls.        
	The leader of the Peoples Committee Against Police Atrocities, Chhatradhar Mahato, said the people of Lalgarh feared the government would use the elections as an excuse to send the police the tribals had shut out for months. The deep distrust of the people of Lalgarh about the police  state or central  prevented us from taking a decision. Most people here believe the government will use this (security for the polls) as an excuse to bring in policemen who will not leave even after the elections.        
	Mahato said a more representative meeting, consisting of 118 members from across the tribal belt, would be held on April 18 to take a final call. Only 36 members attended todays meeting.        
	Police sources in Lalgarh said Maoists, suspected to be guiding the tribal movement, were pressuring the committee to stick to the no-police stand. The rebels, they said, were not only opposed to the police presence but also to the polls.        
	They are exerting tre- mendous pressure on Mahato and Co, knowing fully well that the elections in Lalgarh cannot be held without the police, the source said. He added that the rebels larger plan was to scuttle the polls and strengthen their base in the absence of the police.        
	On Sunday, chief electoral officer Debashis Sen had proposed to Mahato and other tribal leaders in Calcutta that only police drawn from other states or central forces would oversee the elections and leave Lalgarh immediately after the polls. Mahato had said he would think over the suggestion.        
	At todays meeting, the group within the committee opposed to the police appears to have prevailed. These leaders insisted that even central forces should not be let in under any circumstances.        
	A smaller section in the committee is said to have favoured allowing the central forces along with rights activists.        
	This group reportedly argued that not letting the police in would mean no polls. If that happens, the regions people would be doing what the Maoists had always wanted: a boycott of the elections.        
	This (boycott) would only give the government a ground to brand everyone in Lalgarh a Maoist, a member of the group was quoted as saying at the meeting.        
	In Calcutta, chief secretary Asok Mohan Chakrabarti ruled out the possibility of Lalgarh going without polls because of the continued resistance to the security forces.        
	Why should the people of Lalgarh be denied the opportunity to vote? The elections have to be held. We have no objection if the polls are held in the presence of the central forces and not the state police        
	Chakrabarti said he was also willing to talk with Mahato but the tribal leader rejected the offer saying a dialogue was already on with the Election Commission.

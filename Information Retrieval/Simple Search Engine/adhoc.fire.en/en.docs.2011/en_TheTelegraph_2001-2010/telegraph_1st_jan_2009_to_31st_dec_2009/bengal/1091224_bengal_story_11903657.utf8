	Calcutta, Dec. 23: Land minister Abdur Rezzak Mollah today said CPM supporters would retaliate against any attacks from the Opposition.        
	If they hurl bombs at us, well hurl bombs. If they cut the throats of our people, we will cut their throats, he said while reacting to the murders of two CPM members in South 24-Parganas in three days.        
	He also said the CPM was full of bhejal (fake) elements, who needed to be purged.

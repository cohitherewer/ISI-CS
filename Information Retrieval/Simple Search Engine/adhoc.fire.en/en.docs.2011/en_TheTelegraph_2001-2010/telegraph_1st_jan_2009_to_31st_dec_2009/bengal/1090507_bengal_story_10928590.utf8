	Tamluk, May 6: Some 500 people today raided fruit stores and groceries that allegedly sold liquor on the sly in a Tamluk village as news of more deaths in Mondays liquor tragedy poured in.        
	The toll went up to 28, with 10 deaths reported from the district hospital in Tamluk town and three from nearby nursing homes. Over 150 people are undergoing treatment.        
	Women armed with sticks led this mornings assault on corner stores or cigarette and fast-food stalls that allegedly sold spurious liquor at the bazaar in Bolluk village.         
	Bolluk and neighbouring Ramtarakhat are the two villages where people from about 10 Tamluk hamlets gathered to drink illicit liquor. Hours after the tragedy struck, the residents of Ramtarakhat had demolished four shops there.        
	Bolluk erupted last evening but police contained the fury by promising to tear down the liquor dens and the other clandestine outlets.         
	After that promise, we had had returned home. But after the toll mounted today, we took the law in our own hands, said Radheshyam Mondal, 42, a labourer.        
	We wont allow any illicit liquor shop to operate in the area. It is because of these shops that so many had to die, said Tarun Kar, 32.        
	The Bolluk mob also demolished a licensed country liquor outlet today. Its owner Subal Adak, who lived on the second floor of the two-storey building, had fled the village with his family after mobs started targeting the hooch dens at Ramtarakhat.        
	After ransacking the shop, the villagers broke into Adaks household and smashed a television set and a refrigerator among other things.        
	No policeman was in sight during or after the rampage. Tamluk circle inspector Gopal Haldar said the police were busy with election work. We are extremely busy with the polls. Moreover, we have not received any complaint from anyone, he said.        
	However, many like Adak could not have complained as they had fled their homes by Monday night.        
	Of the villagers who have died in the district hospital since last night, one was a liquor shop owner himself. Giridhari Gorais shop at the Bolluk bazaar was also ransacked.        
	His daughter Kanan said: My father had been referred to a medical college in Calcutta, but the authorities asked us to wait saying a medical team from the city was on the way. But no such team arrived by 1pm and he passed away.         
	Assistant director of health services S.K. Dutta arrived here later and said: There is a space constraint in the hospital but I think the doctors are trying their best.        
	Tomorrows polls matter little for about 500 people whose relatives are battling death here. My husband is in hospital. The polls mean nothing to me, said Annapurna Sarkar.

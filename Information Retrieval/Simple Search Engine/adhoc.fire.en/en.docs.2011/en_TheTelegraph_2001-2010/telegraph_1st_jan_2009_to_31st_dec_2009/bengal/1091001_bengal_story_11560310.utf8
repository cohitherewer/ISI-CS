The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Siliguri poll pits Cong vs Trinamul
                                                                                                               Siliguri poll pits Cong vs Trinamul
          OUR BUREAU                              
	Sept. 30: The Congress and the Trinamul Congress have fielded separate candidates for Siliguri mayor and chairperson, elections to which will be held tomorrow.        
	The nominations cannot be withdrawn and voting will take place through secret ballot, Darjeeling district magistrate Surendra Gupta said.        
	In the 47-ward Siliguri Municipal Corporation, the Congress and Trinamul (which has the support of an Independent) are tied with 15 seats each. The Opposition alliance had snatched the Siliguri Municipal Corporation from the Left Front after 28 years.         
	Since all 47 councillors can vote, those from the Left Front, with 17 seats, will have a decisive role to play if there is cross-voting between the Congress and Trinamul. But Trinamul is still hoping that a real contest will be averted through a last-minute understanding.        
	AICC general secretary K. Keshava Rao, in charge of Bengal affairs, spoke to Mamata Banerjee this afternoon.         
	I have requested Mamataji to withdraw her candidates for the two key posts so that elections could be averted. I reasoned with her to part with the mayors post to Congress in order to strengthen our alliance and take it forward to the 2011 Assembly polls, Rao said.        
	But Mamata, who left for Delhi this afternoon, apparently stuck to her guns.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Buddha for PM? CM wont say
                                                                                                               Buddha for PM? CM wont say

	Calcutta, April 12: Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee today said his front would share power at the Centre if the situation arose but left open the question on whether he would join such a dispensation.        
	If the situation arises, we (the Left) will join the government.... I dont know whether I will join it or not. But our party will, the chief told a meeting with intellectuals.         
	At another meeting in the evening, this time on the campaign trail in Jadavpur, he said: If the third front garners enough strength and unity can be maintained among its constituents, it wont be difficult to choose the Prime Minister from within it. For us the question of who will become the Prime Minister is secondary.        
	The question of Bhattacharjee becoming a possible Left candidate for the post of Prime Minister was stoked by state party secretary Biman Bose yesterday.         
	Asked if Bhattacharjee was the Lefts candidate for the top job, Bose said: It is still not clear which political force will emerge victorious and which combine would bag how many seats. So, how can I say whether Buddha babu will be the Prime Minister or not?         
	Bhattacharjee today clarified that the CPM took all decisions collectively, unlike other parties. His hint was perhaps at the controversy over the partys refusal to allow Jyoti Basu to become the Prime Minister in 1996  a move Basu later called a historic blunder.         
	We have been running a coalition government for 32 years and know how to settle issues if there is unity on policy matters, Bhattacharjee said about the third front, which the Congress and the BJP have been scoffing at.         
	The CPMs partners in the Left Front, however, felt the talk about Bhattacharjees possibility of becoming the Prime Minister was raised to boost the morale of the party cadres who are facing a tough fight against a united Opposition.        
	Bhattacharjees hands are already full till 2011 when the next Assembly polls are due. There are many claimants for the Prime Ministers seat in the third front. The CPM knows it only too well, said an RSP leader.        
	Sources said the chief ministers meeting with intellectuals was a bid to win them over after they criticised the government for its land acquisition policy in Singur and Nandigram.         
	Bhattacharjee pointed out that some faces he would have liked to see in the intellectual crowd were missing. Why have all the intellectuals not come. I would have loved to see some faces who have many questions to ask. No government likes to order a police firing, he said, referring to Nandigram.

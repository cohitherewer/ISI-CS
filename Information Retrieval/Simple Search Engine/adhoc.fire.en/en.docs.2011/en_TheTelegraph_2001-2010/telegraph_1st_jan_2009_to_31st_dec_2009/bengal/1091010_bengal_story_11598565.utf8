The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | NGO probe
                                                                                                               NGO probe
                            
	Calcutta: Director-general of police Bhupinder Singh today said there were reasons to suspect that funds meant for tribal welfare had been used for buying arms for the Maoists.        
	We have got information on this. Probably, foreign funds flowing into some NGOs involved in tribal welfare and development have been diverted for buying arms and ammunition for Maoists. Earlier, we had reports of the LTTE helping the Maoists to procure arms, Singh said.        
	He also informed that Chhatradhar Mahato had revealed during interrogation that he had connections with some political parties and their leaders. I will not name them but Mahato had links with some party leaders. The Maoists are our target. So, we are not concerned about political parties.                           
	However, those who have maintained links with Mahato or Maoists basically played with fire. They either get singed or burn their fingers. (Trinamul panchayat pradhan of Sonachurra) Nishikanta Mondal was close to Maoists but probably got killed by them. We are trying to collect more evidence by questioning Chhatradhar, Singh said at Writers Buildings today.

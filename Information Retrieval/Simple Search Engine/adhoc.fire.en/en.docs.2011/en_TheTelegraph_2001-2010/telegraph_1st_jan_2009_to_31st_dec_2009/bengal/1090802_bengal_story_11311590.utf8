The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Illness sends auto to crane
                                                                                                               Illness sends auto to crane
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Calcutta, Aug. 1: B 5077, an auto whose owner neither had a fitness certificate nor had applied for conversion, became the face of the crackdown in Calcutta today.        
	When the police hoisted the auto on a crane at Park Circus and took it away, they not only found its papers missing but also the relatives whom the owner had apparently taken to a hospital.        
	 A sergeant stopped Bapi Mondal as he was trying to speed past the Park Circus crossing. The sergeant followed me on a bike, overtook me and finally forced me to stop, the 36-year-old Sonarpur resident said.        
	Mondal pleaded with the police that he had taken an uncle with a heart ailment to Chittaranjan Hospital on his auto (WB 04 B 5077), which generally plies between Garia and Hazra.        
	The police said no relative was in the vehicle when it was seized. The driver did not have an updated fitness certificate for the two-stroke auto registered in August 2000. He hadnt even applied for conversion. We had no option but to seize the vehicle, said an officer of the Beniapukur police station.        
	Mondal said he had decided not to stray into Calcutta because of the ban but was forced to do so. My uncle, who stays in Sonarpur, fell ill with heart trouble and had to be brought to Chittaranjan Hospital.         
	The possibility of getting caught had crossed my mind but I thought the police would consider my case since I was not ferrying a passenger but relatives in a medical emergency.        
	However, with the relatives as well as the papers missing, he admitted: I wish I had applied for a conversion. Then they (the police) would have shown mercy.

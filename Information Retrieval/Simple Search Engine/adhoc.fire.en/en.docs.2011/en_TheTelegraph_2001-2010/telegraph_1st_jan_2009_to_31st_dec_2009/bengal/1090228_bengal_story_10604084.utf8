	Calcutta, Feb. 27: A CPM leader who owns four buses and brokers real estate deals in Rajarhat has gone missing.         
	Sunil Chandra Roy, 55, left his home in Rajarhats Tarun Sengupta Upanagari yesterday morning and didnt return.        
	North 24-Parganas superintendent of police Supratim Sarkar said the CPM local committee members family had not received any ransom call.        
	Roys daughter Rupanjali, who is preparing for her HS exams, said he was an early riser. I was studying in my room around 5.30am when he came in and asked me about my preparations. A little later, he left the house, wearing a jeans pant and a full-sleeved shirt. Her elder sister Swarnanjali is doing a computer course.         
	Roys wife Aloka said his four buses ran on route No. 217 and he negotiated deals for land and flats in the area, where apartment buildings have mushroomed. He always carried his phone with him. Yesterday, he left it behind, she said.        
	The police are probing Roys recent relationship with members of the local Kalipark Sporting Club, of which he is the president. He had a tiff with some of them. We are looking into the clubs financial matters, said an officer of the airport police station.        
	The chairman of the local municipality, Roys friend Tapas Chatterjee, said: He had appeared a little disturbed and told some of his friends hed like to visit Baba Ramdevs ashram to reduce stress.

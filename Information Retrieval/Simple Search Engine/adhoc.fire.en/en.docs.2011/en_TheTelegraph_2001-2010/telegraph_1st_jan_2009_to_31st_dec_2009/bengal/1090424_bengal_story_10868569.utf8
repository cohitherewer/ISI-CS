          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Calcutta, April 23: Forward Bloc veteran Asoke Ghosh today blamed the media for twisting his quotes out of context to make it seem like he was hinting at the chief ministers involvement in the Nandigram firing.        
	The old but temporary differences within the Left Front have been deliberately raked up before the Lok Sabha polls to confuse people and create fissures among allies, he said in a statement.         
	Reposing his total faith in the chief minister, Ghosh said: The chief minister himself had admitted administrative mistakes and expressed regret publicly time to time. We took steps jointly to avoid the repeat of the mistakes.

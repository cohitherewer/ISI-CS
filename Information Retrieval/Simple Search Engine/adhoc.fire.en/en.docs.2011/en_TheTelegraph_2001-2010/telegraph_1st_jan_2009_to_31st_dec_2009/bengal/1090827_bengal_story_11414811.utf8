The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Proletariat shatters boardroom class ceiling
                                                                                                               Proletariat shatters boardroom class ceiling
          SAMBIT SAHA                          Industries minister Nirupam Sen with Caparo boss Swraj Paul at the boardroom when the Singur project was alive                                  
	Calcutta, Aug. 26: Bengals proletariat has bowed to the dictatorship of a bourgeois habit: the air-conditioned boardroom.        
	Leaders of a Citu-backed union yesterday strode into the boardroom of the West Bengal Industrial Development Corporation to hold a meeting there, foregoing the familiar surroundings of a room assigned to them elsewhere in the building.        
	What was discussed at the meeting is not known. Little of substance was being dissected in the boardroom in any case since the Singur agitation following which not too many investment proposals have come the way of the agency meant to promote industry in the state.        
	The WBIDC Employees Union has its own room in the office. But it does not have an air-conditioner.        
	WBIDC managing director Subrata Gupta said he had come to know about yesterdays incident. I was not there yesterday. I will ask them why they held the meeting there, he said.        
	The rooms of the chairman  industries minister Nirupam Sen  and MD are in the same row as the boardroom on the first floor of the building in Dalhousie.        
	According to conventions that could be termed archaic in seamless, not to mention classless, organisations, besides Sen, Gupta, the two executive directors and independent directors, no one uses the room.         
	If the unions objective was to shatter the invisible ceiling, it did so in keeping with the highest traditions of iconoclasm. The union apparently did not seek permission to use the room.         
	Some 15-20 Citu supporters led by one Subrata Sengupta attended the meeting. Sengupta could not be reached for comment today.        
	Ever since investment proposals had ebbed, the boardroom was being regularly used by various panels of the corporation. An executive committee meeting took place on Monday.

          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Tamluk, May 31: A teacher in a state-aided school has not got her salary for eight months after she did not shell out Rs 50,000 that the institution allegedly demanded on her day of joining.        
	Moumita Nayek, a 24-year-old MSc in geography from Calcutta University, was recruited through the School Service Commission and posted in Gopinath High School in Tamluk on September 22, 2008.         
	On the day of joining, she said the schools management committee told her she would not be allowed to join until I promised to pay Rs 50,000 to the school fund. Moumita, who stays in Tamluk, said she would be unable to pay the amount. The school authorities told me then that I could join but my salary may be blocked if I didnt pay.         
	The teacher, who did her graduation from Gokhale Memorial Girls College in Calcutta, said she started teaching but didnt get her October salary. Till May this year, she had not got a paisa.         
	The school authorities told me it would take a few months before the district inspector of schools approved my salary and made arrangements for the payment.         
	But Moumita later learnt from the district inspectors office the treasury had allotted her salary on March 18 and she was supposed to get her pay with the arrears.        
	Moumita went to East Midnapore district magistrate C.D. Lama. The DM ordered the BDO to conduct a probe, Moumita said. Chandipur BDO Sudipta Ghosh found that the school had unlawfully held back her salary. He wrote to the headmaster Lakshmikanta Dolui to disburse Moumitas salary with arrears.        
	Nothing happened.         
	Moumita then lodged a complaint with additional district magistrate Srikumar Chakraborty, who also wrote to the headmaster. We have come to know that despite our instructions... to clear the teachers dues, she did not get it, it said.        
	Madan Mohan Chakraborty, the secretary of the school managing committee, claimed Moumita had said she would donate some money to the school fund. But, later, she refused to pay. She has deprived the school and as a result, she is suffering.

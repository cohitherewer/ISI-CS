The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Man pulled out of paws
                                                                                                               Man pulled out of paws
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Calcutta, Jan. 30: A pouncing tiger missed the nape of a mans neck and hit his head instead. A second blow came soon and then a third but the miss was as good as a meal.        
	Joydeb Haldars mates hit the tiger with sticks and forced it back into the Sunderban forest from the knee-deep waters of a river last night.        
	The blow on the neck is what kills most tiger victims instantly. The blow on the head, however, could still be fatal for Joydeb. He was given nearly a dozen stitches at a block hospital in Kultali, South 24-Parganas, and shifted to SSKM in Calcutta early this morning.        
	Divisional forest officer Subhendu Banerjee said: It appears that the tiger struck the man several times on the head. He also had injuries on his shoulders and face.        
	At SSKM, a doctor said: He is in a semiconscious state. We will be able to say whether he is out of danger only after 48 hours.         
	Joydebs brother Rabiram, who was in the group of seven that went to the Matla tributary, about 120km from Calcutta, to catch fish and crabs, said: Three of us were standing next to our mechanised boat and looking for fish and crabs. Joydeb was beside me, his head bowed down to locate fish. Suddenly, I found him screaming and wrestling with a tiger that was repeatedly striking his head with its paws.        
	Those on the boat jumped into the river with sticks and started hitting the tiger. Struck repeatedly, the tiger released Joydeb, swam about 10 feet to the riverbank and disappeared into the forest. We carried him back to the boat and sailed for nearly two hours to reach the hospital, said Rabiram.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Mamata raises bargain stakes
                                                                                                               Mamata raises bargain stakes
          BARUN GHOSH                          Mamata: Pressure tactic                                   
	Calcutta, July 26: Mamata Banerjee today staked claim to both the Sealdah and Bowbazar Assembly seats but, unlike when she bargained for the Lok Sabha polls, the Congress reacted with an expression of displeasure.        
	The two Calcutta seats won by the Congress in 2006 fell vacant as Somen Mitra and Sudip Bandopadhyay became MPs on Trinamul Congress tickets.         
	The Congress feels it has a right to both seats, but is ready to spare one for Trinamul in the interest of the alliance.         
	However, Mamata told her aides today to pick party nominees for the two seats. Didi told us we will field candidates from both seats because we have a stronger presence than the Congress, said state party president Subrata Bakshi.        
	Nominations for the August 18 bypolls have to be filed by Wednesday.        
	Bakshi said the decision was taken following the rank and files demands. Why should we accept one seat? We want both, he asserted.         
	The Congress high comm-and accused Mamata of going back on her words. I was given to understand during my talks with her in Delhi that she wants either Bowbazar or Se-aldah. But I have been told that she now wants both. This is unfair and I have already sent a message to her in Calcutta conveying our displeasure, party general secretary K. Keshava Rao said over the phone from Hyderabad.         
	Asked if the row over the seat could jeopardise the alliance, Rao said: We will have to keep it intact and take it forward to the 2011 Assembly elections. But at the same time, we must take note of the sentiment of our partys ranks in Bengal. We want Mamataji to allow us to put our candidate in at least one seat.         
	The note of displeasure followed phone calls from several state Congress leaders, urging Rao not to surrender to Mamata again. The Congress had accepted Mamatas seat-sharing deal for the parliamentary polls, because of which it got to contest only 14 of the 42 seats in Bengal.        
	We called up Rao to convey our protest, said a state Congress general secretary. We told him there should be a triangular fight if Mamata insists on both the seats.        
	Congress legislature party chief Manas Bhuniya met state president Pranab Mukherjee at his home. We told Pranabda to make Mamata agree to offer us both the seats. If not, at least one, since we had our MLAs from both the places.        
	However, when a partyman told Mukherjee the local units would be left demoralised if the leaders conceded ground to Mamata, he apparently shot back: Dont tell me all that. You must accept whatever the AICC decides.         
	Outside, a Youth Congress activist from Bowbazar said. The situation has become such that one day the AICC might us to plant Trinamul flags atop our party offices to keep Mamata happy.

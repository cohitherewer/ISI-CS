	Purulia, June 24: Maoists stormed the homes of a Purulia CPM leader and supporter and took away three motorcycles before blowing up a licensed country liquor shop owned by the party activist last night.        
	A police team went after the rebels in Balarampurs Kurni village, about 300km from Calcutta, but the rebels fled in the darkness.         
	Around 20 Maoists first broke into the home of local committee member Phatik Mondal and, when they did not find him, asked for his rifle. Told it had been surrendered to the police, they took away his motorcycle.        
	Mondal, also the vice-chairman of the Darda panchayat samiti, has been staying away from home during nights over the past few weeks fearing the rebels would target him.         
	The next target was CPM supporter Bankim Mondals house next door. But Bankim, the liquor shop owner, was also not there. The rebels took away his two motorcycles before blowing up his shop on the village outskirts.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Raze looms on Digha hotels
                                                                                                               Raze looms on Digha hotels
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Tamluk, May 21: About 10 hotels being constructed within 500 metres of the sea in Digha face the prospect of demolition as district authorities have declared them illegal.        
	East Midnapore district magistrate C.D. Lama has asked the Digha-Shankarpur Development Authority to stop the construction. Besides the 10 new hotels, 50 existing ones are being expanded in such a way that they would violate the coastal regulation of sparing 500m of the seaside.         
	The Trinamul Congress-controlled Ramnagar-I panchayat samiti sanctioned plans for the construction work over the past two years.        
	Lama said the coastal belt in Digha is under the jurisdiction of the Digha-Shankarpur Development Authority (DSDA) and the panchayat samiti was not authorised to sanction building plans there. The panchayat samiti cannot sanction building plans in areas under the DSDA. I have asked the development authority to prepare a list of all the illegal construction work and take legal steps, she said.        
	Trinamul wrested the Ramnagar-I panchayat samiti from the CPM in last years rural elections. Debabrata Das, the sabhapati of the panchayat samiti, said the building plans sanctioned were outside the 500m limit. We have the authority to sanction building plans in Digha, he said.

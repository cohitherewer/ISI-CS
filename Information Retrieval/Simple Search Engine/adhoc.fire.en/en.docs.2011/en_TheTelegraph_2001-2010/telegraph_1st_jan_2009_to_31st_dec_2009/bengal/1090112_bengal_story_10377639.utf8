                                                                                                               Meet to check goods hoarding
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Calcutta, Jan. 11: Chief secretary Asok Mohan Chakrabarti has called a meeting at Writers Buildings tomorrow to discuss steps on checking possible hoarding by traders in the wake of the rise in prices because of the truckers strike.         
	Home secretary Ardhendu Sen, food department officials as well as top police officers will attend the meeting.        
	The nationwide strike that began on Monday has already sent vegetable and fish prices on an upward spiral.         
	Prices of vegetables have risen by at least Rs 5 a kilo and fruits have become costlier by Rs 10 on an average.        
	The prices of fish and eggs have also risen.         
	We shall take stock of the situation arising out of price hike of vegetables and fish at tomorrows meeting. Steps to prevent hoarding by some dishonest businessmen, who may take advantage of the price hike, will figure in the meeting, Chakrabarti said this afternoon.         
	Later, home secretary Ardhendu Sen said the police had been asked to conduct raids in several city markets to check hoarding. Stern action will be taken against those found hoarding, he said.        
	Sen said food department officials, who have also started monitoring the city markets, will submit a report tomorrow that will be discussed at the meeting.         
	Traders said prices would rise further after tomorrow if the strike was not called off by then. All the trucks coming into the city with perishables from other states would reach their destinations by tomorrow and there would be no fresh supplies after that. Raja Roy, the general secretary of the Calcutta Goods Transport Association, said: We cant help if the prices have gone up. If trucks dont come carrying goods from other states, things are bound to worsen.        
	Highway block         
	Traffic on Durgapur Expressway was disrupted for two hours this morning when Congress supporters led by Abdul Mannan blocked it near the abandoned Nano plant demanding that land be returned to unwilling farmers. The roadblock was lifted at 12.30pm.

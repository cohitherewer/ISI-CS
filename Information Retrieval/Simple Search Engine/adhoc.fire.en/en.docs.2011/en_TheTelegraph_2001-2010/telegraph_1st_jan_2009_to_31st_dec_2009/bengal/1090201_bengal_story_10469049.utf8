	Howrah, Jan. 31: The Lakhotias may have been taking the help of prime suspect Santosh Singh to run their real estate business without even knowing his notoriety in native Bi-har, preliminary police investigations have revealed.         
	Apart from running a flourishing sweetmeat shop, Panch Bhog, the Lakhotias have a real estate business, promoting multi-storeyed apartments off Grand Trunk Road and at Shibpur in Howrah.         
	Police said they had been taking Santoshs help in handling deals. What they hadnt realised, perhaps, was the price they would have to pay.         
	Sleuths working on the case believe Santosh, originally from Samastipur in Bihar, is the mastermind in the abduction and murder of Anil Lakhotias child.         
	If the police are to be believed, Santosh is a proven hand in kidnapping, being wanted in at least two cases in Bihar.        
	He had apparently demanded Rs 4 lakh from Yashs uncle Nandu Lakhotia 10 days before the boy went missing. When Nandu refused to pay, Singh had allegedly threatened to harm the family.        
	The police have found that Santosh used to work for another of Yashs uncles, Arun, before he died in 2004. After Aruns death, he started working for Nandu and Anil.        
	We are probing the exact nature of Singhs relationship with the Lakhotias and whether he had previously made any threat to any of their family members, a police officer said. We are aware that Santosh was close to the Lakhotias and knew their everyday routine. He was also very familiar with their children.        
	A senior officer said this wasnt the first murder in the realtor circles of Howrah. We have worked on many such cases in the past.        
	Shibpur has witnessed a boom in real estate with the second Hooghly bridge and Foreshore Road, along the river, making access to Calcutta smooth from south Howrah.        
	On August 19, 2008, two ex-tortionists-turned-promoters were killed at Kalibabur Bazaar in Shibpur. Swapan Das alias Chaal Swapan and Swapan Bar alias Maachh Swapan, the proprietors of Maa Kali Builders, were first stabbed and then shot point blank.         
	Investigations revealed that they were killed by their trusted lieutenants Chhotu, Pintu, Kalta and others. The apparent trigger: a row over the sale of a closed cinema where an apartment building had been planned.        
	On February 7, 2008, Rambabu Shaw, his wife Kewla and teenaged daughter Deepika were charred to death in their one-room house near the Shibpur Police Lines. Their land-lord, Kashinath Jaiswal, who had allegedly threatened and asked them to vacate the premises so he could build an apartment block, was arrested. Jaiswal is now out on bail.

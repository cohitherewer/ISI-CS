The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Graft slur shuts varsity
                                                                                                               Graft slur shuts varsity
  - Visva-Bharati VC protests strike sitting under a tree        OUR CORRESPONDENT                          VC Rajat Kanta Ray reclines on the grass at Chhatimtala during his protest against the strike. (Indrajit Roy)                                        
	Santiniketan, Oct. 24: Visva-Bharati said it would seek a central probe into allegations of corruption and money laundering against vice-chancellor Rajat Kanta Ray after its teachers today joined a strike by non-teaching employees to press the demand.        
	We shall approach the Centre asking it to probe the charges of corruption at the university in response to a demand by our non-teaching staff, the universitys public relations officer, Amitabha Chowdhury, told a news conference this evening.        
	However, the non-teaching employees union, Karmi Sabha, has decided to carry on with the agitation that began yesterday. We have heard nothing from the authorities on the probe. So, our strike will continue, said Debabrata Hazari, its secretary.         
	He added that the employees wanted the CBI to inquire into financial irregularities during the tenure of vice-chancellor Rajat Kanta Ray.         
	Ray, who took charge in June 2006, sat alone under a tree for over five hours from 8.30 this morning to protest against the ceasework. No classes were held at the institution, which opened only on Thursday after a long festival break that started on September 15.        
	Among the charges levelled against the university authorities is that of selling a CD carrying copies of some of Rabindranath Tagores unpublished paintings to a private company for a paltry Rs 9,000.        
	The VC has also been accused of misappropriating central funds. A Rs 18-crore grant to undertake welfare schemes for backward caste students was illegally diverted for the construction of the Bhasa Bhavan, Karmi Sabha president Debabrata Sarkar alleged.        
	He also complained that the varsity had spent nearly Rs 10 lakh on the VCs medical bills in three years.         
	Sources in the university rubbished the charges. They said no such CD had been sold and the VC was entitled to full reimbursement on actuals.        
	The secretary of the teachers body, Kishore Bhattacharya, said they decided to join the strike after having concluded that the charges against Ray were genuine.        
	However, registrar Manimukut Mitra suggested the unrest could be an attempt to divert attention from an ongoing probe against two Karmi Sabha members who have been accused of illegally possessing some of the articles of the Rabindra Bhavan museum.         
	The union said it had sent its list of charges to Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, the chancellor, governor Gopalkrishna Gandhi, the rector, and Union human resource development minister Kapil Sibal.

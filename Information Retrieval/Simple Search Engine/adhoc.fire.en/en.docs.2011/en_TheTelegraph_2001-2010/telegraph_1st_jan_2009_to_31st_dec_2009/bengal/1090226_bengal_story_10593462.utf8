	Calcutta, Feb. 25: The state government today accepted the Fifth Pay Commissions recommendations and announced an average pay hike of 32 per cent for its employees.         
	Teachers and non-teaching staff, employees of civic bod- ies and panchayats and pensioners will also get the raise, to be given from April 1, 2009, with retrospective effect from April 2008.         
	The hike for 10 lakh emp-loyees and three lakh pensio-ners will cost the exchequer about Rs 5,500 crore, finance minister Asim Dasgupta said at Writers Buildings.         
	We have, in general, accepted the pay commissions recommendations. The government has issued a notification informing all government departments, schools, municipalities and panchayats about the hike (from April 1, 2009). There will be an average pay increase of 32 per cent. In some cases, the figure may be a bit higher , Dasgupta added.        
	The arrears for the period between April 2008 and March 31, 2009, will be paid in three yearly instalments.         
	Pensioners will get the ar-rears in eight equal monthly instalments from this August.        
	With the new scales, house rent allowance would be paid at 15 per cent of the revised basic pay subject to a ceiling of Rs 6,000 a month. Dearness allowance will be 16 per cent of the revised basic salary.        
	The medical allowance will be Rs 300 a month. The ceiling on the reimbursement of cost of medicines has been raised from Rs 1,000 to Rs 2,500 for each occasion of hospitalisation, the minister said.        
	The rate of annual increment in the revised pay structure will be 3 per cent of the basic pay. Increment will be given on July 1 every year.         
	In case of pensioners, the minimum amount of pension/family pension has been raised from Rs 1,300 a month to Rs 3,300 with effect from April 1, 2008.         
	The government has accepted the pay panels recommendation that employees who have rendered 20 years of service should be eligible for pension that would be 50 per cent of the last basic pay drawn in the event of their resignation or retirement, Dasgupta said.        
	The state government will have to spend an additional Rs 5,500 crore on account of the revised pay-scales for its 13 lakh employees and pensioners, Dasgupta, surrounded by hundreds of cheerful Writers employees, said.

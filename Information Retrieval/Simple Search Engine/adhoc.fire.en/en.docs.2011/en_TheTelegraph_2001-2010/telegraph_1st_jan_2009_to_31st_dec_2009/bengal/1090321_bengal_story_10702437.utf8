                                                                                                               Unseated, MP Buxla quits RSP
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Alipurduar, March 20: Sitting MP Joachim Buxla quit the RSP today and accused it of lacking transparency, days after the party refused to field him from Alipurduar in north Bengal for a fifth time.        
	 Party central committee member Kshiti Goswami confirmed receiving the resignation letter. He has alleged that there was lack of transparency in the working of the party and a lot of lobbying (for tickets), said Goswami, upset as he cared for Buxla like my child.         
	I tried my best to convince him but failed. Nobodys above the party, Goswami added.        
	Junior Bengal PWD minister Manohar Tirkey has replaced Buxla, who could contest as an Independent.         
	Ill announce my plans tomorrow. But I can say this decision will mark a turning point for the Dooars, Buxla said.

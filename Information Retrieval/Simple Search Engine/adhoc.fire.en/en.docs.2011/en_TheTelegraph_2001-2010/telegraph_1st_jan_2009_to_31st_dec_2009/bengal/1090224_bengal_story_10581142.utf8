                                                                                                               Another cop axed in Malda 
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Malda, Feb. 23: An officer of Manikchak police station was suspended today for asking for bribe to hush up a case.        
	The suspension comes a day after two officers of the Pukhuria police outpost were suspended for asking a girls father to withdraw a case against a CPM leader, accused of raping the minor. The policemen had also held a salishi meeting on the rooftop of the outpost to settle the amount that the CPM leader would give to the girls family and to them. The girls father had alleged that the policemen had allowed the CPM leader to go scot-free.        
	In the latest development, district superintendent of police Satyajit Bandyopadhyay was stunned to hear a conversation between sub-inspector Bikash Bhadra and Beizul Haque in which the officer demanded Rs 10,000 to settle a case.         
	Beizul, who resides in Dharampur, 30km from here, had recorded the conversation in his mobile phone.         
	Beizul said he and 11 others in his family had been implicated in a false case. He said the officer had asked him to see him at the police station with Rs 10,000 on February 18.The second officer summoned me over the telephone and had asked me to bring the cash to get a case registered against all the 11 members of my family settled. He had also promised not to arrest me on any pretext, Beizul said.        
	A cautious Beizul got the whole conversation recorded on his mobile phone. Accompanied by Congress MLA Sabitri Mitra, Beizul went to the district police chiefs office on Friday to lodge a complaint against the second officer. Since the police chief was not in office, I called him up over the phone and sought his intervention. He heard the recorded conversion and suspended the police officer. But the false case has not yet been withdrawn, the Congress leader said.        
	Mitra said Beizul and his elder brothers in-laws had a long-standing feud over the possession of land.         
	The police had registered a case against all the members of Beizuls family on the complaint of his enemies and had been trying to extort money. The district police chief said: We shall take stern action against the dishonest officers on the basis of specific complaints.        
	The suspension of three officers in 24 hours has become a talk of the town in Malda. Circle inspector Satya Chakraborty had inquired into both the cases in which the policemen had been charged with corruption.

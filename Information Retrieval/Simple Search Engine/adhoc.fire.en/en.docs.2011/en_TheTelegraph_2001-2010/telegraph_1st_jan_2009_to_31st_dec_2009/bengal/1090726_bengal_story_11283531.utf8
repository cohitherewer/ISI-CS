The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Before ban, a number riddle
                                                                                                               Before ban, a number riddle
          KINSUK BASU                              
	Calcutta, July 25: The question before police is not how to keep old vehicles off Calcuttas roads, but how many.        
	The state transport department, the citys police and the public vehicles department have all come up with different figures on how many vehicles would be taken off the roads, heeding the July 31 deadline set by Calcutta High Court.        
	The figures provided by the transport department to Calcutta police say there are just 1,157 two-stroke autorickshaws that would have to stop running.         
	But the police have counted 8,485 such autos  over 7,000 more than the transport departments figure.         
	The public vehicles department has another figure. It says there are 6,731 autos that are two-stroke.         
	The transport departments claim is absurd, said a senior police officer.         
	If you just count the number of two-stroke autos plying on the Lohapul-Park Circus route and the Ultadanga-Ahiritola route, the figure would be close to 550, a senior officer with the traffic police said. How can the total be 1,157?         
	In the case of minibuses, the state transport department has told the police that 220 vehicles would have to stop running.        
	Again, the police have a higher figure. Their estimate is around 500.        
	The high court ordered that all commercial vehicles more than 15 years old and two-stroke autos operating in the Calcutta metropolitan area  that is Calcutta, parts of Howrah, Hooghly and the two 24-Parganas  would have to stop plying by July 31.        
	Vehicle owners went on a strike protesting the order but the court did not blink.        
	Once the numbers are settled between the cops and transport authorities, the law enforcers will get down to work. Once the figures are ready, the rest would follow, an officer said.        
	Today, most senior officers were busy cross-checking the numbers with the transport and the public vehicle departments.         
	There are some 28 categories of vehicles, including deluxe buses, commercial trailers, tractors and even three-wheelers carrying goods that have to be considered while working out a blue-print for executing the order, said a senior officer of Calcutta police. If the numbers are not right, how do we go about with the planning?         
	With the state government yet to give any specific order on the crackdown, the police top brass and the transport department officials have decided to sit for a meeting on Monday, sources said.        
	We have arranged for trawlers and other vehicles that would be required to tow away the seized vehicles. The traffic guards too have been briefed, the officer said.

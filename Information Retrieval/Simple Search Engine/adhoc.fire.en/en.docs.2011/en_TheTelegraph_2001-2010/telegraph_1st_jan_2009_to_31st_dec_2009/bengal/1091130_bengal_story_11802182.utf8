	Singur, Nov. 29: Mamata Banerjee today said she was willing to enter into a joint venture with Buddhadeb Bhattacharjees government for a railway coach factory in Singur, almost throwing a challenge at the state government to show who wanted industry more.        
	The Trinamul Congress leaders proposal came a day after it became known that Bharat Heavy Electricals Ltd (Bhel) had turned down the state governments proposal to set up a thermal power plant on the 1,000 acres originally acquired for Tata Motors.        
	We are ready for a joint venture with the state government on that land. The states equity will be land and the railways will invest in the (coach) factory, she said after laying the foundation stone for a perishable cargo complex in Singur.         
	However, the joint venture will only be possible if the state government returns from the Tata plot the 400 acres that she accuses it of acquiring forcibly. We are ready for (setting up) a coach factory in Singur. But the 400 acres will have to be handed over to unwilling farmers. The factory can come up on 600 acres, Mamata said.         
	Soon after taking over as railway minister, Mamata had sprung on Singur the coach factory proposal, taking a symbolic pro-industry stride. However, she had then wanted the Centre to take the land from the state government and set up a factory in a joint venture with private investors.         
	I have spoken to various Union ministries. If the Centre gives us the land, we will develop industry on 600 acres and return 400 acres to the farmers, the railway minister had said while flagging off the Singur-Howrah Andolan Local in August.         
	Experts had then said that it would not be possible for the Centre to hand over the plot to Mamata because land is a state subject. The Singur plot had been acquired for the state by the West Bengal Industri- al Development Corporation. Tata Motors is merely a lessee and the Centre cant interfere, a person in the know said.         
	Railway ministry sources said there was no immediate plan to send the joint-venture proposal to the state government. We are not aware of any plan to send such a proposal, an official said from Delhi.        
	No one from the Bengal government was available for comment. CPM leaders were busy with a party meeting till late into the night.        
	However, Mamatas pro-industry gestures since assuming office in Delhi have not gone down well with the CPM. The CPM leader in the Lok Sabha, Basudev Acharya, today criticised the misuse of land in her move to build an automobile logistic hub at Shalimar in Howrah.        
	(The) railway land at Shalimar was acquired during the late Madhavrao Scindias tenure as minister for the construction of a full-fledged South Eastern Railway terminal. But instead of doing that, the ministry has allocated the land for a private project, PTI quoted Acharya, a former railway standing committee chairman, as saying.        
	In Singur, Mamata pledged to provide land at the cargo complex free of cost to 16 families that owned plots in the Tata project area. They can set up stalls and run small businesses, she said.         
	Scores of other farmers also demanded the benefit. We have also lost land to the Tata project and are suffering, but Didi has not done anything for us, said Abha Patra, 40, who owned about an acre in the plot acquired by the state.        
	The cargo complex will provide Singur farmers a facility to store up to 1,000 tonnes of potatoes and 500 tonnes of vegetables and fruits. They will be able to send their produce anywhere in the country in refrigerated containers through the rail-linked complex. The cold chain will minimise damage to vegetables and fruits and a ensure fair price for farmers, Mamata said.

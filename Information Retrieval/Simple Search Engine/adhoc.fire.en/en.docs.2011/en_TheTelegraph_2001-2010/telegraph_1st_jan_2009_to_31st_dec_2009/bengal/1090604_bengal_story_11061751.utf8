   Boats on way, planes on wait           SUJAN DUTTA                                                  
	New Delhi, June 3: Army doctors and engineers, naval boats and air force planes were alerted for Bengal today after public outrage targeted at chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee and his party colleagues moved the state government to SOS the Centre in the aftermath of Cyclone Aila.         
	This morning, the joint services headquarters directed 20 teams of armed forces medical personnel to head for North and South 24-Parganas after the Bengal government asked the defence ministry for help.         
	Two service aircraft have been kept on standby to fly pouches of drinking water.        
	Writers Buildings told South Block it wants every kind of skill, manpower, knowhow and every kind of resource  from distributing water pouches, to providing medical care and repairing embankments  from the army, navy and the air force.         
	The navys establishment in Calcutta, INS Netaji Subhash has sent four Gemini boats to the Sunderbans. Four more boats are being sent.         
	The air force was asked to keep an IL76  its largest transporter  and an AN32 aircraft on standby for 24 hours to fly pouches of drinking water on a special request from the state government.         
	A company of army engineers has been asked to give technical advice to repair 895km of damaged embankments. Two columns of the army and eight divers from the navy are also engaged in relief and rescue, said defence ministry spokesperson Sitanshu Kar.        
	The massive amount of help sought by the state has prompted the defence ministry to hand over the responsibility to the Chief of Integrated Defence Staff (CIDS), the joint services set-up, that has entrusted the task a Disaster Coordination Management Group (DCMG) headed by the Assistant Chief of Integrated Defence Staff (joint operations). The CIDS had also supervised Tsunami relief.        
	The meeting of the DCMG assessed the requirements of the Bengal government at 30 medical teams, each with one medical officer and two to three nursing assistants. For the moment the the Directorate General of Armed Forces Medical Services can provide 20. Ten more maybe sent later.        
	It was decided that the medical teams will move with the army columns engaged in relief. The Eastern Command in Fort William will co-ordinate the administrative requirements with the state government.         
	The medical teams were to be deployed within 24 hours. The Bengal government also asked for 15 boats or launches.         
	Naval headquarters reported that four Geminis were sent from INS Netaji Subhas to the affected areas.         
	Additional Geminis have been kept on standby in the eastern naval command headquarters at Visakhapatnam.         
	An army source said a company of the 6 Engineers is raising a taskforce to reinforce and rebuild embankments in the Sunderbans.         
	The Bengal government has asked for technical advice on reconstruction  and not manpower  for the task.         
	The task force is already surveying the areas.         
	An air force source said an IL-76 or an AN-32 will be provisioned at two-hours notice to ferry relief. Depending on the amount of relief to be carried, the aircraft will be decided. If the smaller, AN-32, is required, it would be available even earlier because of bases in the Northeast.

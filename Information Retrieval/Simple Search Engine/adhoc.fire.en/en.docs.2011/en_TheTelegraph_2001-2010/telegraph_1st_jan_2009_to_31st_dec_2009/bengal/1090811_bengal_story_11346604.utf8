The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Gandhi letter to stress neutrality
                                                                                                               Gandhi letter to stress neutrality
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Calcutta, Aug. 10: Governor Gopalkrishna Gandhi today sent a letter to chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee and a copy of it to Left Front chief Biman Bose, explaining his statement on the political violence in the state and emphasising his neutrality, CPM sources said.        
	The letter was apparently triggered by the criticism of his statement on the veritable tandava of political violence, which the Left said was not impartial as the governor had not expressed his concern in public about the violence unleashed by Maoists against CPM sympathisers.        
	Also appended with the letter were copies of the governors earlier statements to reaffirm his impartiality.         
	In the copy to Bose, CPM sources said he attached a forwarding note saying he had explained to the chief minister why the allegations were inaccurate. Gandhi hoped it would clear the air.         
	Although the CPM had publicly criticised him in harsher words earlier, this is the first time Gandhi has stressed his impartiality.        
	According to CPM sources, Gandhi pointed out to the chief minister how he had released a statement conveying his sense of shock over the blast on the chief ministers route near Midnapore last November and the great relief over the fact that no harm had come to him.        
	On June 3, Gandhi had said: I am grieved to learn of the death of three police personnel and injury to some others on duty at Sarenga at the hands of terrorism. The trio had been shot dead by suspected Maoists.        
	Neither Raj Bhavan nor the CPM disclosed the contents of todays letter or spoke on it.         
	CPM sources said Gandhi had pointed out that he had always tried to uphold constitutional propriety.         
	However, a party leader wondered why the letter was sent to the chief minister when he had not questioned the contents of the governors statement.         
	Sources said the governor, in his note to Bose, expressed hope that the chief minister would be able to explain Gandhis impartiality to the front chief who, in turn, could convey it to the ranks.        
	Bhattacharjee and Bose kept mum on the issue, but party state secretariat member Shyamal Chakraborty said: The governor is an educated gentleman with humane values. But we only objected when we found his humane values came into play selectively.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Morcha hits roads, threatens trains
                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      Morcha hits roads, threatens trains
          OUR BUREAU                          Vehicles try to speed through a narrow and congested NH31A, which leads to Gangtok from Siliguri, to beat the blockade. (Chinlop Fudong Lepcha)                                  
	Dec. 27: Gorkhaland supporters choked traffic on three national highways for several hours today and threatened to stall trains from tomorrow as the administration ruled out using force to stop them.        
	Most trains to the region from other parts of Bengal go through New Jalpaiguri and are unlikely to be hit but the Sealdah-bound Kanchankanya Express, which uses the Sevoke line along the foothills, could get delayed if the protesters stick to their noon-to-4pm threat.        
	The train is popular among tourists on their way back from the Dooars, a big draw since the unrest in the hills.        
	At least two Northeast trains  Capital Express, which connects Patna with Guwahati, and the Jhajha-Guwahati Express  could be also hit.        
	The highway blockade tomorrow will be an hour longer than todays. It will start at noon and continue till 4pm. During these hours, we will also obstruct trains that move to and from the Northeast, said Keshav Raj Pokhrel, general secretary of the Gorkha Janmukti Morchas student wing.        
	This morning, hundreds of supporters of the Vidyarthi Morcha descended on the ro- ads that connect Siliguri with the Darjeeling hills, Sikkim and the Northeast. Vehicles tried to hurry through before noon, but since the roads were blocked at several places  Panchnoi, Sevoke, Teesta Bridge and Rangpo  they got stuck at one point or the other.        
	Blockades will be put up at more places tomorrow, Pokhrel warned.        
	At Panchnoi, a kilometre from Darjeeling More in Sili- guri, Matigara block development officer Samarjit Chakrabarty tried in vain to persuade the students to lift the blockade. At the other places, there was no intervention from the administration.        
	State chief secretary Asok Mohan Chakrabarti had yesterday said: No national highway can be blocked. It will mean violation of a Supreme Court ruling. We will have to take steps to enforce the law.        
	Today, Darjeeling district magistrate Surendra Gupta said: We are holding talks with the Morcha leadership. We will not resort to any pressure tactics as that could make the situation worse.         
	At Panchnoi, on the Siliguri-Darjeeling road, the line of vehicles stretched to about a kilometre on either side. The number of protesters was higher at Sevoke, the point of entry into Siliguri from the Dooars, Kalimpong and Sikkim. There, vehicles were stuck for up to 3km.        
	Pokhrel said the blockades were meant to send a message to the Centre and the state.         
	Pandoras box        
	In Delhi, chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee said a Pandoras box could open, with demands for innumerable states, if the Centre went ahead and formed the second states reorganisation commission.        
	For what (the commission)? There are already demands for creating 28 more states. More will come.        
	At his meeting with the Prime Minister yesterday, Bhattacharjee had asked Manmohan Singh about how he planned to deal with the unrest over Telangana as it had a direct bearing on Bengal.         
	His impression was that the Centre was unlikely to take any decision on Telangana till a consensus was achieved. I gathered from the Prime Minister that the government is seriously trying to hold consultations with all parties in Andhra Pradesh and at the national level.        
	He said: There are forces demanding separate states (Gorkhaland and Greater Cooch Behar in Bengal). It is a great worry for us. Our partys stand is consistent. It is neither possible nor desirable....

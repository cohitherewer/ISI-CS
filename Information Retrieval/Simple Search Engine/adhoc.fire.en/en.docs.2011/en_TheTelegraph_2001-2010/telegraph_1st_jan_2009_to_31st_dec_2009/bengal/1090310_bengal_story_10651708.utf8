The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Drive to seal deal in Rahul presence
                                                                                                               Drive to seal deal in Rahul presence
          OUR BUREAU                              
	March 9: Efforts are on to arrange a meeting between the Congress leadership and Mamata Banerjee in New Delhi on Thursday or Friday if the loose ends in pre-poll arrangement are tied up by then, sources in Delhi said.        
	If the Trinamul Congress chief goes to Delhi, the alliance will be announced in the presence of Rahul Gandhi and Sonia Gandhi, they said.        
	Till then, both sides are expected to keep up the pressure in public to convince their respective ranks that no undue ground has been yielded to the other side.        
	For Mamata, the joint announcement in Delhi with Sonia and Rahul will serve three purposes. First, it will send a message to the Congress rank and file that she enjoys the support of the Gandhis and ensure their co-operation during the campaign.        
	Second, Mamata will make the point that she deals with the Congress leadership and state leaders are not that important in her scheme of things. Finally, by having Rahul by her side, she will try and attract young voters.         
	One Delhi source said the deal could be announced as early as tomorrow. But in Cal-cutta, a Trinamul leader said a Congress leader had called Mamata from Delhi and asked her to be in the capital for the announcement on Thursday. She will leave accordingly, he said.        
	Bengal Congress president Pranab Mukherjee said the alliance had taken a final shape. We have finalised our list of nominees after days of deliberations with Mamata        
	Mamata, however, said she was waiting to hear from the Congress. I am also ready with a list of candidates. But I cannot announce it until I get feedback from the Congress. I am waiting for the Congress to get in touch with me.         
	Sonias political secretary Ahmed Patel apparently contacted Mamata last night to request her to spare some winnable seats for the Congress.        
	At a meeting tonight, Mamata told her aides to start visiting the districts after Holi to tell grassroots workers about the alliance. Unlike in 2001, we will have to ensure that the alliance is at the grassroots. We want Congress workers to work with us as they did for Madan (Mitra) in the Bishnupur West (Assembly) bypoll, she was quoted as saying.         
	Some state Congress leaders, including MLA Deepa Das Munshi, said the partys rank and file would not accept the deal if it wasnt honourable.

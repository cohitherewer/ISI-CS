                                                                                                               Sonia in state on April 27
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Sonia: Bengal bound                                  
	Calcutta, April 5: Sonia Gandhi will address rallies in Siliguri, Malda and Jangipur on April 27, three days before the first round of the general election in the state.        
	The Congress president will be in the state twice in the run-up to the polls, the party general secretary in charge of Bengal said from Delhi today. In the first phase, she will address rallies in Darjeeling, the two Malda seats (North and South) and Jangipur (foreign minister Pranab Mukherjees constituency). Before the second phase on May 7, she will visit Calcutta and the adjoining districts, K. Keshava Rao said.        
	The details of her second tour are yet to be finalised.        
	Fourteen Lok Sabha constituencies will vote on April 30.         
	Rao said he had discussed Sonias itinerary with state Congress working president Pradip Bhattacharya in Delhi yesterday.         
	Back in Calcutta now, Bhattacharya said Prime Minister Manmohan Singh and Rahul Gandhi would also address rallies in Bengal. Singh will address one rally and Rahul will come twice, for the second and third (May 13) phases.         
	I am in regular touch with Pranabda to finalise the Prime Ministers tour programme and that of Rahul Gandhi, quot; he added.        
	Congress sources said Mamata Banerjee would share the dais with Sonia, Rahul and Singh in their rallies in south Bengal. Whether she will tour north Bengal with Sonia is not clear.        
	Trinamul state president Subrata Bakshi said: Our alliance with the Congress will get a new momentum if Mamatadi shares the platform with senior Congress leaders like Soniaji, Rahulji and the Prime Minister.         
	State Congress sources said Mamata might visit the state Congress headquarters, Bidhan Bhavan, next week for a joint news conference with Mukherjee. It will be an attempt to send a message to workers in both parties who have not taken the alliance well.

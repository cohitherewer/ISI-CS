The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Maoist papers in Writers 
                                                                                                               Maoist papers in Writers 
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Calcutta, May 8: CPI (Maoist) leaflets demanding the immediate release of a dozen of its jailed leaders were found inside Writers Buildings today.         
	About 30 of them had been folded together and placed on a locker in the press corner on the first-floor, which also houses the chief ministers office. A peon saw them.        
	Police could not say how the bundle reached there. Gaur Chakrabarty, a spokesperson for the Maoists whose signature followed the demand on the leaflets, said: They had been distributed during a procession taken out by the Bandimukti Committee (a pro-rebel outfit). Someone, who could be our sympathiser, must have collected the leaflets and kept them in Writers.         
	Among the jailed leaders named are Maoist politburo member Sushil Roy, who has been charged with triggering blasts in West Midnapore, and Somen, a former Bengal chief of the rebels accused of waging war against the state.        
	Maoist posters urging lower-level police personnel to defy their superiors had appeared on Writers walls last year.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Factories tree deadline eased
                                                                                                               Factories tree deadline eased
          ABHIJEEET CHATTERJEE                               
	Durgapur, July 26: Deadlines for pollution-control measures in Bengal are meant to be elastic.        
	The time limit for sponge iron factories to plant trees in their areas has been extended from the end of the July 14-21 forest week to the end of monsoon (first week of October).         
	The leeway came after the 60-odd units in the state told the pollution control board they wouldnt be able to plant 5,000 trees each within July 21.        
	Over half the 62 sponge iron units in the state, each of which releases around 4,000kg of carbon dioxide in a day, are in Burdwan. The others are spread across Bankura, Purulia and the two Midnapores.         
	We had asked the factories to plant the trees during the forest week but most of them expressed their inability to do so. So we decided to wait till the end of the monsoon, pollution control board chief engineer Subrata Ghosh said.         
	After several deadlines were extended for the phase-out of two-stroke autos and over-15-year-old vehicles in Calcutta, the government has promised a crackdown from July 31.        
	Asked what the pollution control board planned to do if the factories missed their new deadline, Ghosh said: We will fine them between Rs 50,000 and Rs 10 lakh depending on the plants size and degree of violation. We may even shut down the units.        
	Doctors in Burdwan said the pollutants from the sponge iron factories caused rashes and respiratory problems.         
	The only solution is increasing the green cover and not slapping fines, the board admitted. Chief scientist Deepak Chakraborty said: Trees increase the airs oxygen content and absorb carbon dioxide.         
	The sponge iron factory owners association blamed lack of land for not being able to keep the deadline. Spending about Rs 50,000 on the green drive is not a big deal for us, but finding the land is. We need the help of local panchayats, said secretary Subhendu Bhattacharya.

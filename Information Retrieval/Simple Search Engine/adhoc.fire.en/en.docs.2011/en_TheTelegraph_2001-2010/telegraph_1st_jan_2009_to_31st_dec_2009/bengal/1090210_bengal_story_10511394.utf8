	Darjeeling, Feb. 9: The Gorkha Janmukti Morcha has decided to raise a force of 2,000 youths trained in martial arts and archery.         
	Morcha youth wing chief Alok Kant Mani Thulung said the unit would be a committed force that can do anything for the cause of Gorkhaland.         
	We are looking for educa-ted, unmarried youths. Recruitment will start next week.        
	The hill outfit already has an army of volunteers called Gorkhaland Personnel.        
	The Morcha started to enforce an indefinite shutdown of government offices today and said it would not even spare courts, as promised earlier.        
	A leader said: We have decided to shut the courts down till we finish our own probes.

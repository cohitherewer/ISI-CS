The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Unfazed Buddha pledges caution 
                                                                                                               Unfazed Buddha pledges caution 
          OUR BUREAU                              
	Calcutta, June 29: Chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee told the cabinet core committee today he would not go back on his decision to comply with the central ban on the CPI (Maoist).         
	But he also promised his colleagues that the extension of the ban to pro-Maoist outfits and consequent arrests under the Unlawful Activities Prevention Act would not be made without his consent.        
	Kshiti Goswami (RSP), Nandagopal Bhattacharya (CPI), Naren De (Forward Bloc) and Kiranmay Nanda (Socialist Party) iterated their objections to the clamping of the ban, saying it went against their legacy of opposing Draconian laws, and expressed fears about the political cost of collaborating with the Congress-led Centre to rein in their ideological cousins.         
	But the arguments didnt cut ice with Bhattacharjee. I assure you that the arrests under the UAPA will not be indiscriminate. I wont allow the use of these provisions against persons and organisations unless and until I am satisfied, a minister quoted him as saying.        
	Bhattacharjee said the forces in Lalgarh and adjoining areas had arrested 22 people so far and none of them under the UAPA.         
	Goswami questioned the distinction being made between Maoist spokesperson Gaur Chakraborty, who has been booked under the UAPA, and the duo caught trying to plant landmines in Bankura yesterday. And Bhattacharjee said: They are ordinary tribals who had either been brainwashed or pressured by the Maoists (to do that). We have to deal with them differently. Chakraborty is an important catch for us.        
	According to another minister, Bhattacharjee told them Chakraborty had spent six months in Nandigram during its violent phase and played a key role in organising the Maoist presence there.        
	However, Bhattacharjees promise that the police would seek the home secretarys permission before booking a person under the UAPA did not apparently filter down to the districts. Hours later, the Bankura duo were slapped charges under that law.        
	Home secretary Ardhendu Sen said he had sought a report from the Bankura police chief on why this was done without my knowledge.         
	The RSPs Manoj Bhattacharya said: There is anarchy in the administration combating Maoist anarchy.        
	However, Bhattacharjee made it clear the central forces would stay in Lalgarh till normality returned. The crackdown under way in West Midnapore and Bankura will be extended to Purulia.        
	The forces today detained two men in Sarenga who had fled Lalgarhs Kantapahari in the wake of the police action there. Gautam Pal, in whose house they had taken shelter, was also held.

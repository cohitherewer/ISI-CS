                                                                                                               Bird flu hits Siliguri fringe
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Siliguri, Jan. 3: Bird flu has been confirmed in Matigara on the outskirts of Siliguri town.        
	The Darjeeling district administration today said 60,000 birds within 3km of Benoy Krishna Pally village of Matigara block would be culled in the next few days.         
	The operation began this evening itself in some areas. Officials said around 500 poultry birds were killed.         
	The culling area will cover Siliguri subdivision, Rajganj block of Jalpaiguri and 34 wards of Siliguri town. Around 1,000 birds will also be culled at Pubong village in Darjeeling Sadar subdivision.        
	All areas within 10km of the flu zone will be under surveillance, district magistrate Surendra Gupta said.         
	After several meetings with senior police officers and officials of the animal resource development department and the district administration, he announced the formation of 30 culling teams.         
	Each team will comprise five animal resource officials, two employees of the concerned blocks and two policemen. The compensation would be paid on the spot and each family that has lost poultry will be paid an additional Rs 500 after the culling operation is completed, said the district magistrate.         
	No decision has been taken on banning the sale of poultry in the flu zone. Gupta said: We have not yet received any government order to stop sale or consumption. However, the movement of poultry products from areas within 3km of Benoy Krishna Pally would be stopped.         
	Officials said they had arrived at the number of birds to be culled on the basis of a livestock census conducted in the district in 2007.         
	The outbreak at Matigara comes barely seven months after the flu was detected at Pounikumari in Kurseong, around 22km from Siliguri, and at Pulbazar in Darjeeling.         
	Englishbazar block in Malda was affected last month.

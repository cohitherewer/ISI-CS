The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Unity cry after breach in citadel
                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      Unity cry after breach in citadel
  - Protesters hold parallel convention outside WBCUTA venue        OUR BUREAU                          Higher education minister Sudarshan Ray Chaudhuri, who attended the inaugural WBCUTA session                                        
	Calcutta, Dec. 6: The West Bengal College and University Teachers Association urged members to stay united after a section boycotted its annual general meeting today for the first time since its birth in 1926.        
	The Telegraph had reported on Sunday that Mamata Banerjees party had made inroads into the CPM-controlled association.        
	At the meeting, WBCUTA leaders promised to immediately pressure the government to meet the dissidents demands, particularly the one to raise the retirement age from 60 to 65 years, in a bid to prevent a split. We have included their demands to fill vacant posts and increase the retirement age, but they still went ahead with the boycott, general secretary Tarun Patra said.        
	Patra thinks the protest is politically motivated, possibly alluding to a Trinamul Congress hand. I think the protest is politically motivated and has been called only to attract media attention. The leaders of the DTAAF (Democratic Teachers for Autonomy and Academic Freedom) want a political foothold.        
	The protesters held a parallel programme at College Square, opposite the Calcutta University hall where the WBCUTA was meeting, raising slogans against the CPM-controlled body.        
	The WBCUTA denied sitting on teachers demands until it realised that it was on the verge of a split. There is no reason for any member to feel we are sitting on their demands. We are trying our best to settle major issues such as implementation of enhanced pay scales, increasing the retirement age and creating additional teaching posts, said Srutinath Praharaj, a WBCUTA executive committee member and CPM MLA.        
	Speakers repeatedly reminded members about the reputation of the association. I found a leaflet where some of our executive members were asking for an AGM boycott and calling others to attend their meeting at College Square. I asked them to attend the meeting (AGM) and promised to raise their grievances here, but they were adamant, said Patra.        
	Over 50 members spoke at the WBCUTA meeting but none of them expressed any dissatisfaction about its activities. A teacher from Prasanta Chandra Mahalanobis Mahavidyalaya, who did not want to be named, suggested that some of them were gagged. I had registered my name to voice my grievances but they did not allow me to speak. This is the reason why people are breaking away, he said.        
	The members of the rebel group stressed that they were still part of the WBCUTA but were demonstrating outside to put their views forward. We are still part of the WBCUTA. But our demands were long ignored by the leaders. We decided to protest under a separate banner outside the AGM venue to attract more attention, said Kalyanmoy Ganguly, WBCUTA vice-president and convener of the DTAAF.        
	Ganguly and some of the other moving forces behind the DTAAF are associated with the Trinamul higher education cell.

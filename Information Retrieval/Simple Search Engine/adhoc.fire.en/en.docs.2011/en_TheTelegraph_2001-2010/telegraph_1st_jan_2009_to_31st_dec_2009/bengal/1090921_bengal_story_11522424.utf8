	Midnapore, Sept. 20: Maoists last night shot dead a 70-year-old man and his nephew in Belpahari for being part of a vigilante group to counter the rebels.        
	Before leaving, they left leaflets saying the two  JMM supporters Manik Mandi, 70, and Bagen Mandi, 30  were punished for setting up a gana pratirodh committee against them. The rebels also said the victims were police informers.        
	The police said Manik Mandi, 70, and Bagen Mandi, 30  both JMM supporters  had been instrumental in setting up the committee to resist the Maoists and the Peoples Committee Against Police Atrocities at Krishnapur village in Belpahari.        
	Manik was also the uncle of Dhaniram Mandi, a doctor of a Belpahari health centre, who was killed along with a nurse and a driver in October last year when their car was blown up by Maoists in Chowkishal forest.        
	A police officer said Manik had set up the pratirodh committee along with Sudhir Mandi, a Jharkhand Party (Naren) activist, who was killed by the Maoists in December last near Chakadoba in Belpahari.         
	Both Manik, a former JKP (N) worker, and Sudhir were former presidents of Binpur-II panchayat samity.         
	Manik was also an active member of the Bharat Jakat Majhi Marwa, a tribal organisation, and was working for the welfare of Santhals.        
	In another incident, villagers owing allegiance to the Peoples Committee Against Police Atrocities blocked the path of about 50 security personnel at Chandra in Midnapore Kotwali area last night when the jawans went there to arrest four villagers on charges of having Maoist links. However, the jawans were successful in arresting the suspect and returned to their camp.        
	Around 9am today, about 100 villagers arrived at the camp and hurled bricks in protest. Villagers also alleged that women were assaulted during the raid last night.        
	The police later resorted to lathicharge to disperse the mob and arrested 12 villagers, 11 of whom were women.

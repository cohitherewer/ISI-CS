                                                                                                               Buck up: party to ministers
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                          
	Calcutta, Feb. 9: The CPM today asked its ministers to pull up their socks and speed up development projects that affected rural poor, particularly the tribals, backward castes and minorities, before the general elections were announced.         
	The party brass reviewed the progress and problems of the departments in the presence of the chief minister, the daylong exercise the most elaborate in recent times, according to insiders.        
	The ministers were told to kick-start held-up projects before the model code of conduct came into force as there was no bar on ongoing projects.         
	The government and the party will focus on job generation and rural development, as industries minister Nirupam Sen later put it (see box).         
	Bengal is a laggard in the implementation of several central schemes and a team from Delhi is now touring the backward districts for a review.        
	Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee had dared the Opposition to stop his industrialisation drive yesterday, but todays meeting didnt discuss industry. It can wait till the elections.         
	The focus is strictly going to be on development projects and welfare schemes for the rural poor and the minorities, a CPM support base whose erosion became evident after the rural poll reverses last May.        
	Land minister Abdur Rezzak Mollah said no major land acquisition proposal was pending with his department. His focus will be on distribution of tilling rights to the landless.         
	The polls are likely to be notified soon. So gear up to implement schemes that concern the poor. Ensure spending of central and state funds and get work done on a war footing, state party secretary Biman Bose told the ministers.         
	Many of them pointed out that key offices like PWD and irrigation were with the allies. The chief minister promised to supervise co-ordination between these departments.        
	Bhattacharjee had promised such reviews more often after he assumed office with the promise of a do-it-now government.         
	Sushanta Ghosh  the minister for the western region that includes the impoverished tribal belt  who has often been slammed for failing to spend his funds, complained that his department had no independent infrastructure and had to depend on local administration and panchayats for implementation of projects.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Nayachar neither open nor shut
                                                                                                               Nayachar neither open nor shut
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                    
	Calcutta, May 29: Industries minister Nirupam Sen today expressed hope that the Manmohan Singh government would not go back on its earlier cabinet approval for the chemical hub at Nayachar.        
	We received a letter from the Centre after experts examined all aspects and the cabinet gave its approval to the project, Sen said after a CPM state secretariat meeting this morning. We hope the govern- ment would not change its earlier position and (instead) help us move ahead. Let us see whether it changes its policy.        
	However, what Sen did not mention was that the crucial clearance from the environment ministry was still awaited.        
	This is what Mamata Banerjee referred to today when she was asked about her misgivings about the Nayachar project on environmental grounds. Subject to clearance, the Trinamul Congress leader and railway minister said. I am waiting for the environment departments report.        
	Trinamul minister Mukul Roy, too, gave the impression that the party was not keen on expressing its opinion on the project at the moment.         
	It will be too premature to comment now, Roy said. Let us see if the environment ministry gives the necessary clearance. Then well take a call on the Nayachar project.        
	Trinamuls tone, which is subtly different from the outright rejection before the polls, suggests that the party does not want to limit its options by committing either way.         
	The party is still opposed to the project. But it does not seem to be eager to be held responsible for the projects demise if it fails to take off, unlike in Singur where land was an issue and the party was at the forefront to claim credit for driving out the Nano.        
	Nayachar, where land is not an issue, and the attendant environment issues do not appear to have the emotive appeal of Singur.        
	If the environment clearance  the application has not yet been filed  is rejected, the project will die without Mamata having to shoulder blame for killing off an industrial venture.        
	On the other hand, in case Delhi grants environment clearance and the responsibilities of power demand that Trinamul does not stand in the way, little prevents the party from saying that it will honour the rules of the country.        
	In any case, signals emanating from the Left Front government after the elections suggest that it is not in a hurry to push through the project.        
	Sens fellow secretariat member Shyamal Chakraborty said environment could not be an issue for Bengal alone. The Centre has given the green light to chemical hubs in three states after considering all aspects. If one project has to be shelved on environmental grounds, all three will have to be abandoned.        
	Despite the public posturing of the CPM leaders in support of the project, chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee as well as the state party secretariat have made it clear the Bengal government would go slow on industry in view of the electoral drubbing the party suffered.        
	Partners like the RSP, CPI and the Forward Bloc have renewed their reservations about the project pointing out that the chief ministers aggressive campaign, making the hub a poll plank, did not cut ice with voters who deserted the Left over Singur and Nandigram.         
	The chief minister himself did not mention the Nayachar project in his note to his cabinet colleagues yesterday.        
	The note also had no word on big industry, but stressed small and marginal industries for creation of jobs while admitting the negative impact of Singur and Nandigram in the election results.         
	Sen and Chakraborty today further indicated the government and the partys mood on the post-poll pace of industrialisation and the vexed issue of land acquisition. It is not that all investors in our ongoing projects have left Bengal. We will try to implement them. But industrialisation will not depend on me. The global meltdown has affected our part of the world, too, Sen said.        
	Both stressed consensus before any land acquisition. We have said there would be no forcible takeover. We will talk to all involved in case land is needed for a particular project, Sen said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Citu calls power strike
                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      Citu calls power strike
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Tamluk, Nov. 26: Citu has called a days strike at the Kolaghat thermal power project on December 7, betraying a renewed appetite for disruptions after tasting blood at Haldia Petrochemicals.        
	The CPM-led union has demanded higher wages for 3,000 casual workers at the power plant  the same reason for the four-day strike in Haldia Petrochemicals that ended after the company agreed to a 146 per cent raise.        
	The parallels do not end there: like in Haldia, Citu is facing an erosion in its ranks because of the growing clout of a Trinamul union.        
	Another similarity: the spearhead of the strike is Lakshman Seth who led the Haldia ceasework.         
	The one-day strike at Kolaghat is not expected to disrupt power supply in Calcutta. Although the plant meets some of the citys demand, a one-day shortfall can be made up, officials said.        
	But the second strike call in less than a week has deepened the concern of industry. The silence of the CPM, which had reined in Citu when the chief minister had launched the industrialisation drive, is being viewed as an endorsement of the arm-twisting tactics in the face of political setbacks.        
	The strike is a bad omen. This will upset potential investors and hurt the common man. We had come out of the bandh-and-gherao raj, but it looks like it is coming back in the changed political scenario, said Biswadip Gupta, CEO of JSW Bengal Steel.        
	Citu general secretary Kali Ghosh, however, said: Irrespective of whether this would send a wrong message to investors, we have to fight for the workers.        
	The union confirmed that Haldia provided the catalyst. The successful strike in HPL prompted us to call the strike at Kolaghat, Citu general secretary Bijon Mitra said.        
	Lakshman Seth, president of the Citu-controlled KTPP Thika Majdoor Union, too, justified the strike call. We have given a call for a one-day strike at the project to force the management to implement an agreement signed with casual workers in November 2008.        
	Seth wants a 28 per cent hike in wages for workers earning between Rs 3,500 and Rs 6,000 and a 57 per cent hike for workers earning between Rs 5,000 and Rs 8,000.        
	Unlike in HPL where Trinamul is awaiting government clearance to formally float a union, the party has a labour arm in the Kolaghat plant for the past five years.         
	After the Lok Sabha polls, around 500 workers broke away from Citu and joined the Trinamul union. The real reason behind Seth calling the strike is the threat he is now facing from us, said Trinamul MP Subhendu Adhikary.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Hope for teacher trainees 
                                                                                                               Hope for teacher trainees 
  - Bridge course for those who have cleared Class XII        CHARU SUDAN KASTURI                          PTTI students during a protest in Burdwan                                        
	New Delhi, Sept. 3: The Centre has agreed to conduct bridge courses to legitimise the degrees of thousands of trainee teachers in Bengal who meet its minimum qualifications but face a career-threatening limbo after their institutes were declared illegal.        
	The National Council for Teacher Education (NCTE) plans to conduct special year-long courses to help these students make up for inadequacies in their training at the states primary teacher training institutes (PTTIs), dubbed unauthorised by Calcutta High Court in October last year.        
	The plan will cover all teacher trainees  or those who have passed out from the dubious institutions  who meet school education qualifications required by the NCTE, top government officials said.        
	The NCTE requires aspiring teachers to clear Class XII qualifying examinations with a minimum of 50 per cent marks. All those who meet this criterion will be eligible for the bridge course the NCTE has agreed in principle to conduct, sources said.        
	But the plan will not help legalise the degrees of students who do not meet even the school education qualifications required by the NCTE, the sources said.        
	Officials at the NCTE and the HRD ministry fear the number of such students  who do not meet schooling requirements  may be several thousands because Bengal and the Centre follow different standards. In stark contrast to the standards of the NCTE, Bengal allows admission in teacher training courses to students who clear their Standard X qualifying examinations.        
	We can help all those who meet the minimum schooling qualifications for the teaching profession, but joined the fraudulent institutions. But we cant help those who do not meet minimum schooling standards, a top official said.         
	The crisis over the careers of the estimated 75,000 primary school teacher trainees erupted after the high court held the 140-odd PTTIs illegal.        
	The institutes were running one-year courses instead of the two-year long courses, mandatory under guidelines of the NCTE.         
	Officials in the HRD ministry and the NCTE argued that a summary declaration of validity for all the illegal degrees may amount to a violation of the court order.        
	Any relaxation of the NCTEs own norms and guidelines  either in the schooling qualifications required or in the teacher training course structure  will create a fresh crisis, they argued. Such a move will significantly damage the credibility of the NCTE. Legalising wholesale all the degrees declared invalid will mean that the NCTEs standards are malleable, and neednt be taken seriously, a source said.         
	The officials at the NCTE and the ministry also argued that legalising invalid degrees without considering minimum schooling standards will trigger a chain of similar demands from other states.

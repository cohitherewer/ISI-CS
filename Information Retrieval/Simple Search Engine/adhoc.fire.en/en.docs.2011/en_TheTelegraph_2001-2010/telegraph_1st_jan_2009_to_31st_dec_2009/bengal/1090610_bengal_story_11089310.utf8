The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Lalgarh arrest
                                                                                                               Lalgarh arrest
                            
	Jhargram, June 9: About 200 policemen forcibly removed a roadblock by the Peoples Committee Against Police Atrocities here today, a crackdown not seen since the tribals started their Lalgarh movement last November and sporadically paralysed life in the region.        
	Over 20 people were arrested and slapped attempt-to-murder charges for attacking the force 5km from here.

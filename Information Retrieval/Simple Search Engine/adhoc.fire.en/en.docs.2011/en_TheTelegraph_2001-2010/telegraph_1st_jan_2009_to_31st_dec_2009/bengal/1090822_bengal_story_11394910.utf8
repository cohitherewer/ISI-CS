	Burdwan, Aug. 21: A two-month-old boy has a foetus growing inside him, doctors in Burdwan said.        
	Imraan Sheikhs family took him to a doctor because he kept crying. An ultrasonography revealed the foetus-in-foetu, the result of his mothers multiple pregnancy gone wrong, radiologist T.K. Saha said. The foetus, now gaining in size along with the child, has to be surgically removed.         
	The condition occurs in one in 500,000 children.

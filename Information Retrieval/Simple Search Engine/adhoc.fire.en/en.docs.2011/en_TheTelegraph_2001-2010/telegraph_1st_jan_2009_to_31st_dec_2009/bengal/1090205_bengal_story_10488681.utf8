The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Mamata frowns on Maoist tag
                                                                                                               Mamata frowns on Maoist tag
          OUR BUREAU                               
	Lalgarh/Calcutta, Feb. 4: Mamata Banerjee today warned the state government against branding the people living in the tribal belt of West Midnapore Maoists.        
	Dont brand the people of this tribal area Maoists. If you dont ban the Maoists, call them for talks in order to solve the problems faced by the poor tribals, the Trinamul Congress chief said at the public meeting at Khas Jangal in Lalgarh.        
	Mamata, who is entitled to Z category security, arrived with her supporters from Calcutta around 3.15pm without police escort.        
	It is not possible for us to provide adequate security at Lalgarh to people who are entitled because of the situation there. So, we are advising them against visiting Lalgarh, chief secretary Asok Mohan Chakrabarti said later.

	Calcutta, May 25: What the 1978 floods, the worst in Bengal in a century, did to the CPM and its year-old government, todays cyclone could do for Mamata Banerjee and her Trinamul Congress.        
	Coming on the heels of her electoral victory, the cyclone may be a political windfall for the railway minister, especially because the next round of elections  to 19 municipalities  is only a month away.         
	In 1978, the CPM, fresh from its poll victory, had pulled out all stops to help the victims and consolidate its position in the bargain.        
	Taking a leaf out of the CPM book, Mamata today cancelled her Delhi trip, though her party MPs left for the capital by train in the afternoon.         
	Tomorrow, she would take charge as railway minister in Calcutta instead of Rail Bhavan in the capital.         
	I have cancelled my Delhi trip to stay in Bengal in this hour of crisis. My presence here is required to arrange immediate relief and aid to the cyclone-hit, the Trinamul leader said.         
	Immediately after learning about the devastation in the districts, where she earned major victories both in the rural polls last year and the Lok Sabha elections recently, Mamata set up her own control room at her home on Harish Chatterjee Street.                        Mamta survyes the havoc in Calcutta       
	In the evening, she set out for a whistlestop inspection of the city and asked Railway Protection Force jawans to cut a tree that had fallen on a house on Shambhunath Pandit Street after hearing complaints from residents.         
	The civic authorities have failed to remove this tree, Mamata said. So it is my duty to do so as the local MP.        
	She will go to Kakdwip in South 24-Parganas tomorrow.         
	Only too aware of Mamatas goodwill mission, much in the manner of its efforts three decades ago, the Left Front decided to up the ante. Ministers, led by the chief minister, will visit the affected areas from tomorrow.         
	Additionally, three ministers  Abdur Rezzak Mollah, Subhas Naskar and Subhas Chakraborty  will take sectoral charge of evacuation and relief.         
	Among the worst-hit districts are South 24-Parganas, East Midnapore and Hooghly, which have been starting points of the Trinamul chiefs political battle against the CPM on forcible acquisition of farmland. The CPM was routed in all three districts in the Lok Sabha polls.         
	The municipalities of Sonarpur-Rajpur and Maheshtala (South 24-Parganas), Egra (East Midnapore) and Dankuni (Hooghly) are among the 19 going to polls on June 28. Three of them are now with the Left. The fourth, Dankuni, is a new civic body.        
	Through the day, Mamata spoke several times to Union finance minister Pranab Mukherjee and the Prime Ministers Office. She also urged the defence ministry to mobilise the army in the affected areas.        
	The Trinamul chief did not let go of the opportunity to needle the state government for not having a proper disaster management plan. In all these 32 years, they have not been able to evolve a comprehensive disaster management plan to cope with such calamities, she said.         
	Several leaders from the districts were at Mamatas home today, being briefed about how to go about their job.        
	The CPM said it was also monitoring the damage in districts and doing the needful.         
	We are in constant touch with party leaders in the affected districts to assess the damage and losses, CPM state secretary Biman Bose said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Pranab balm for Mamata
                                                                                                               Pranab balm for Mamata
          OUR BUREAU                              
	June 22: Pranab Mukherjee will talk to Mamata Banerjee to clear misunderstandings over the Centres joint crackdown with the Bengal government in Lalgarh.        
	Our alliance will remain intact. Mamata herself has said shed strengthen it. However, I shall speak to her to clear misunderstandings, if any, the Union finance minister said when asked about the Trinamul Congress chiefs annoyance with the Centre and whether it could impact the Congresss alliance with her party.         
	On a two-day visit to his constituency, Jangipur, about 200km from Calcutta, Mukherjee explained that extending help to a state government was the Centres constitutional obligation and we have done it here (in Bengal) accordingly.        
	Trinamul leaders had been worried that the crackdown on an impoverished tribal region with central help could dent their partys carefully crafted pro-poor image.        
	Mamata had yesterday expressed unhappiness over Delhis decision to send its troops to Bengal without speaking to her. We were not consulted on mission Lalgarh. But one should keep in mind that we have 20 MPs from Bengal in the coalition at the Centre.         
	She added at a party workers meeting: I am against breaking the alliance with the Congress. I want to strengthen it. But at the same time, I would request the Centre not to take decisions solely consulting the CPM because it is more dangerous than a poisonous cobra.        
	Ironically, the Centre has sent the elite Cobra force to Lalgarh.        
	Mamata was not available for comment today, but a party leader said: Didi would continue to pressure the Congress-led government at the Centre if it tries to appease the CPM.

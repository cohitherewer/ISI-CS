The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Talks off
                                                                                                               Talks off
                                          
	A meeting between chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee and Prasoon Mukherjee (left) , the director of the company that was to build the Barasat-Raichak road, was cancelled on Friday.        
	An official in the CMs secretariat said he had been told Mukherjee had urgent work in Indonesia.         
	Some industries department officials, however, attributed the cancellation to the governments sudden and unexpected decision to shelve the project. What, perhaps, upset him most was the fact that he was sitting in Calcutta with an appointment fixed with the CM and he was not told once about it.

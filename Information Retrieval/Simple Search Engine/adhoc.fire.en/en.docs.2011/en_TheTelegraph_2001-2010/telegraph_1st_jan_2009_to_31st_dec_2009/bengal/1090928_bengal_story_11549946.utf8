 - Unlawful Activities Prevention Act and five-day custody for Chhatradhar
    OUR CORRESPONDENT
                         
	Jhargram, Sept. 27: Chhatradhar Mahato was booked under the stringent Unlawful Activities Prevention Act and remanded in five days police custody today. 
    
	The act gives the police 180 days time to file a chargesheet. Under the Indian Penal Code (IPC), a chargesheet has to be filed within 90 days. The maximum police custody duration allowed under the act is also more  90 days in comparison with 14 days under the IPC.
    
	Mahato, who steered the Lalgarh resistance of the Peoples Committee Against Police Atrocities, was arrested yesterday in Birkar village, also in Lalgarh. Two police officers in the garb of journalists from Singapore caught him. 
    
	The tribal outfits leader was produced in the additional chief judicial magistrates court in Jhargram today. Eight others, who have Maoist links, were produced in court with him and have also been remanded in police custody for five days.
    
	The other charges against Mahato, under the IPC, are regarding specific cases of arson. He has been charged with waging a war against the state, demolition of the Ramgarh police outpost, and two attempts to blow up police patrols at Birkar and Kumarbandh, also in Lalgarh. 
    
	With the charges against him, he faces a maximum sentence of life imprisonment, said a police officer.
    
	After his arrest around 2.30pm in Birkar yesterday, Mahato was taken to the Midnapore police lines from where he was taken to the court of the additional chief judicial magistrate, 65km away from Midnapore town.
    
	He was brought to the Jhargram court around noon today in a police van guarded by CRPF jawans armed with automatic weapons. In Jhargram town about 1,500 police and paramilitary personnel were deployed. Chhatradhar is a prize catch. There might be attempts by Maoists to free him from our custody. We took no chances, said a police officer.
    
	Mahatos lawyer Kaushik Sinha, who also represented the eight others, alleged that three of them were beaten up by the police. They had injuries on their hands and legs. The police submitted a medical report in court but the judge observed that causes of the injury should have been mentioned, said Sinha.
    
	Suman Das Mahapatra, the public prosecutor, said the police wanted a two-week custody for Mahato. But the judge remanded Chhatradhar in five-day police custody, he added.
    
	Sidhu Soren, the secretary of the tribal committee, today called an indefinite bandh in the tribal areas of West Midnapore, Bankura and Purulia to protest Mahatos arrest.
    
	The outfits supporters blocked several village roads with trees in the interior parts of Lalgarh. West Midnapore superintendent of police Manoj Verma said the villagers had blocked a road in Dherua and Dharampur with trees. We have cleared the roads. We had anticipated that such things would happen after Mahatos arrest, Verma said.
    
	Soren said from now we will not allow journalists to meet any of our leaders without properly checking their identities. We are also inquiring if any local journalist had taken part in the conspiracy and brought the two police officers to Chhatradhar Mahato yesterday. If any journalist is found guilty, they will be tried in the peoples court.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Tusker kills 2 in Bankura
                                                                                                               Tusker kills 2 in Bankura
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      A tusker during an earlier raid on a Bankura village                          
	Bankura, Aug. 13: A tusker wrapped its trunk around a tribal woman and battered her to pulp before goring a farmer to death in a Bankura village today.         
	One of the survivors of the assault described from her hospital bed how the king of stealth had closed in without a hustle, lifted them by the trunk and slammed them on the ground.         
	Chandibala Sen, 60, has got a broken rib and bruised limbs. Her friend, Reboti Layek, 55, is no more.         
	As I lay in pain, the elephant wrapped its trunk around Reboti and threw her frail body thrice on the ground, said Chandibala.         
	The two had gone to relieve themselves on the edge of their village early in the morning. They did not know what lay in wait for them beyond the clump of trees.        
	The elephant then ran for about 500 metres and attacked Subhash Dey, 42, who was returning home after attending to his paddy field.         
	The giant gored Dey thro-ugh the stomach, trampled his body, trumpeted a few times and ambled back to the forest at Taldangra, around 260km from Calcutta.        
	I was in the fields at a distance when I heard trumpeting and a mans scream, said Mansharam Layek. I went up a few paces and saw the tusker moving away towards the jungle. I went up to the limp body. It was a horrible site.        
	It took a few minutes for Layek to regain his composure. He then ran back to Tilaghagri village, some 500 metres away, and raised the alarm.         
	Panchet divisional forest officer Pradip Biswas said teams had been sent to push the tusker deeper into the jungle. They will beat drums and use torches to chase it back to where it came from.        
	Asked why it could have attacked without any apparent provocation, Biswas said it could be for food. Elephants are known to raid villages in search of food and country liquor.         
	Three loner elephants roam the forests of Bankura, the forester said. Todays attacker was one of them.        
	Its footprints will be matched with those of a tusker that had killed two villagers last month. If they match, we will have to declare the elephant a rogue and kill it, said Dey.

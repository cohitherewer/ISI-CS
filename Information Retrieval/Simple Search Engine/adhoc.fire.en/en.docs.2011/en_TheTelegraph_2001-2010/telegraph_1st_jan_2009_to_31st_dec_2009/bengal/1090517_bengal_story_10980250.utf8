	Malda, May16: Mausam Noor beat the odds in Malda North and dedicated the victory to her late mother Ruby Noor.    
	Her two uncles, Abu Hashem Khan Chowdhury, who retained the Malda South seat, and Abu Naser, had publicly criticised her over the manner in which she had bagged the ticket behind their backs.     
	The controversy played in Mausams favour, a party leader said. It generated sympathy for this young, fresh girl.    
	Today, the uncles said crowed with pleasure over Mausams win. Im happy both our family members have won, said Naser.        
	Darjeeling: The Gorkha Janmukti Morcha won its first poll battle but not the war. Morcha-backed BJP candidate Jaswant Singh won Darjeeling with a thumping margin, but there its joy ended. With the NDA far from power in Delhi, the Morchas wish for a separate Gorkhaland is set to remain a distant dream.     
	However, the Morcha is happy that Jaswant got nearly 85,000 votes from the plains, where there is a strong anti-Gorkha-land sentiment. The hill people started dancing and singing as soon as the first of the 20 rounds of counting was completed.        
	Calcutta: A police officer and a CPM supporter were killed in Murshidabad and an officer was beaten up in South 24-Parganas during clashes set off by the Oppositions victory celebrations.    
	The fear of an escalation in post-poll violence cast a cloud on Buddhadeb Bhattacharjees participation in the politburo meeting in Delhi on Monday. Party sources said he might not attend.

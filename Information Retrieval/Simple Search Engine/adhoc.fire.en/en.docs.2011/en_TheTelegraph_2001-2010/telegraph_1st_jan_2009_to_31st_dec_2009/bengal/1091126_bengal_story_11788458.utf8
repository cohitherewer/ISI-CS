The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Land fix in Bengal

	Midnapore, Nov. 25: The Bengal government is in a flap over land again.         
	It doesnt know where to shift the troops from at least four schools near Lalgarh, a day after Calcutta High Court set a December 31 deadline for police to vacate educational institutions in the Maoist-hit areas.        
	The forces are now occupying 12 schools in the area. The district police said that while eight camps were almost ready, they did not know where they would get land for the remaining four. Even if they get the land now, they do not know how to get the camps ready by December-end.         
	Each camp requires three to four acres. We have begun searching for alternative accommodation where we can shift the forces. But to get three to four acres together is very difficult, said West Midnapore police chief Manoj Verma. He was in a huddle with other senior officers this morning to discuss the land hunt.        
	One of them said it would be extremely difficult to shift the forces from at least four school buildings in Satpati and Moupal in Salboni and Bhadutala and Pingboni in Goaltore.         
	The joint forces have been stationed there since June. Each school building in the four places provides accommodation to at least two companies of forces comprising 200 personnel, said a police officer.         
	He added that if the land was not available by December 31, the administration could be left with no alternative but withdraw the forces from certain areas.        
	Another pressing problem is contractors reluctance to carry out construction in the Maoist-hit areas. Most of these contractors are unwilling to go into the interiors for construction, fearing Maoist attacks. Many a time their trucks carrying materials are being obstructed by the Maoists. As a result, the construction work is getting delayed, the officer added.         
	The administration has also started reconstructing some existing camps. We have three to four acres at Dharampur in Lalgarh. The existing camp, which could accommodate not more than 100 personnel, is being renovated to make room for more, said another officer.

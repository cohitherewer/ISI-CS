The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | 13000 more tech school seats in state from next session
                                                                                                               13000 more tech school seats in state from next session
          A STAFF REPORTER                                            
	Calcutta, March 16: Bengal will have nearly 13,000 more seats in engineering courses from this year.         
	Higher education minister Sudarshan Ray Chaudhuri told the Assembly today the number of seats in private engineering colleges would go up from 19,834 to over 32,000 in the 2009-10 session, mainly because the government had approved nearly 25 new institutes. All of them are expected to start functioning from the academic session beginning July.        
	Almost an equal number of existing colleges will be upgraded this year, pushing up their intake capacities, the minister said.        
	The announcement was made in response to a question by Rampada Samanta of the Democratic Socialist Party, a Left Front partner, who wanted to know how many students would appear in this years joint entrance examinations, seeking admission to the states engineering and medical colleges.        
	Nearly 1.09 lakh examinees will write the JEE this year, the minister said.        
	Never in the past  since the state government allowed private entrepreneurs to set up engineering colleges in the mid-1990s  13,000 seats had been increased at one go.        
	An official said the announcement of the sudden seat jump did not violate the election code of conduct as the approvals had been given before the poll dates were announced. The minister was simply reporting this to the Assembly today.        
	Until a few years ago, engineering seats in private colleges in the state did not fill up. The government then started publishing a JEE merit list that had even students with lower ranks. However, to ensure a minimum standard, a cut-off of 50 per in Class XII science papers was fixed.         
	An official said there were many takers for the extra seats now.        
	Sobhandeb Chattopadhyay of the Trinamul Congress complained about lack of infrastructure and teachers in the private colleges.         
	The minister said the government was trying to ensure that every institute had an adequate number of qualified teachers. A state body has been set up to keep a watch on the colleges, their infrastructure and staff strengths.        
	The teacher-student ratio in the states private engineering institutions is 1:14, which, Ray Chaudhuri claimed, was better than the national standard. According to him, the ratio in private engineering colleges nationally is 1:30.         
	The All India Council for Technical Education stipulates a teacher-student ratio of 1:15, the minister added.

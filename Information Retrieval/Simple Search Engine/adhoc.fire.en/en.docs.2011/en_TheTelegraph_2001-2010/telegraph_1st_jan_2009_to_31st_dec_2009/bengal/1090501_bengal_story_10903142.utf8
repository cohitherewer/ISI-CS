	April 30: The relief of a relatively peaceful poll was shattered this evening when suspected Maoists blew up a jeep carrying polling personnel near West Midnapores Belpahari, killing three.         
	Police identified the dead as Prasad Banerjee, who was in charge of a sector comprising several booths, Sougata Karmakar, his assistant, and Sanjay Das, the driver.         
	From Belpahari, they were returning to the election office set up at Jhargram Raj College, about 30km away.        
	The explosion occurred around 6.30pm and the Mahindra Maxx jeep was blown to smithereens, said a police officer.        
	A severed leg was found 20ft from the mangled heap of metal. Pieces of flesh were strewn all over the pitch-dark place and the smell of gunpowder hung in the air.         
	A cellphone was found near the jeep. The blast was possibly triggered by a detonator with the help of an electrical wire that snaked into the jungle, which the road cuts through.         
	Security personnel followed the wire for 100 metres but did not dare to go further. A BSF team that rushed to the spot stopped a kilometre ahead fearing an ambush. They waited for reinforce-ments, which arrived around 9.45pm.        
	A culvert connecting two villages in Purulias Barabazar block that polling personnel had been using was also blown up.         
	The explosion could have blown up a bus, said a police officer. A vehicle carrying officials to Barabazar town had passed the area only half an hour before. After the blast, other vehicles had to take a detour.                  
	The polling was relatively incident-free.        
	Two BSF jawans were injured when an improvised explosive device went off this morning in the courtyard of a primary school at Biramdih in Purulias Balarampur.        
	Mahesh Kumar, 25, was hospitalised with splinters in his arms and legs. The other jawan escaped with bruises.         
	Mahesh is out of danger. But he will have to remain in the hospital for a few days, said Swapan Sarkar, superintendent of the Purulia district hospital.         
	According to the police, the blast took place when the jawans stepped on something while trying to pull down a banner calling for a vote boycott.         
	Manik Layek was going to vote when he heard a boom and saw a jawan being hurled at least three feet away.         
	Polling at the two booths in the school was suspended.        
	At Ghatbera, also in Purulia, an Adivasi outfit that had called for a boycott of the polls stopped voters being escorted to a booth by CPM workers. An argument snowballed into a clash with bows and arrows in which a CPM supporter was injured.        
	According to the police, both sides shot arrows at each other.         
	In Ranja forest in West Midnapores Salboni, a police team on patrol stumbled on milk cans stuffed with explosives on a road. Experts defused them, said district police chief Manoj Verma.         
	A group of CRPF jawans and polling personnel were held hostage in Belpahari through last night by supporters of the Peoples Committee Against Police Atrocities.         
	The team of 40 was heading to a booth near the Jharkhand border on foot.        
	They were released around 6am. We replaced the polling personnel, said Verma.        
	In Calcutta, home secretary Ardhendu Sen said the blockade was a clear violation of the agreement (the tribal outfit) had reached with the state in the presence of the chief electoral officer.        
	Peoples Committee supporters in Bankuras Barikul held polling personnel hostage for several hours this evening and threatened to snatch voting machines after their vehicle hit a woman.         
	The blockade continued until the police agreed to pay Rs 26,000 as compensation and Rs 6,000 a month as long as Chiramani Tudus treatment continued.

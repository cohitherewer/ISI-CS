The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Writers relishes drama
                                                                                                               Writers relishes drama
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          A crowded Writers corridor. Pradip Sanyal                                  
	Calcutta, Oct. 16: Work at Writers Buildings became the biggest victim of the siege of the chief ministers chamber this afternoon.        
	Home secretary Ardhendu Sen asked who could be blamed for not working amid such pandemonium. Work stopped in departments near and far from the chief ministers office as everyone tried to find out what was happening. If such a pandemonium occurs, can we blame people for not working? Even I couldnt clear pending files, Sen said later.        
	He had to put off his trip to Delhi by the 5pm flight and take a plane later. What to do? Had the agitation continued, I would have been forced to further revise my plans.        
	Officials were seen huddled along the corridors all along and not everyone was an onlooker. Those affiliated to the State Government Employees Federation, which is opposed to the CPM, tried hard to get into the enclosure housing the chief ministers office but were prevented by the police. Our leaders are demonstrating. We cant sit back in our offices and work, said one.        
	An aide to irrigation minister Subhas Naskar gave almost a blow-by-blow account of what he saw from the second-floor balcony  from the time the trouble started at 1.30 till the Trinamul leaders were bundled out. We saw Buddhababu returning at 4pm, but missed how he was escorted to his chamber bypassing the demonstration. The police had shut the gates. After a long time, we got a taste of drama at Writers, he said.

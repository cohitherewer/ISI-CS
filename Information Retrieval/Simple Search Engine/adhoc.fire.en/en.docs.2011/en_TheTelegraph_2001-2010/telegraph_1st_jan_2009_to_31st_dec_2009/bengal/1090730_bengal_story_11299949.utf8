	Calcutta, July 29: The Congress faces a choice of surrendering to Mamata Banerjee, like in the parliamentary polls, or trying to revive the party in Bengal as she rides roughshod over its claim to Sealdah and Bowbazar.        
	What it chooses to do can make or mar the partys future in the state and its prospects in the 2011 Assembly elections.        
	On the last day for filing nominations for the two Ass- embly seats going to polls on August 18, a Congress duo submitted their papers at their central leaders directive, hours after two Trinamul candidates threw their hats in the ring.         
	Mamatas candidate for Bowbazar is Swarnakamal Saha, a leader of the transporters resisting the bid to clean Calcuttas air by phasing out old vehicles. In Sealdah, it is MP Somen Mitras wife Shikha.        
	Congress councillor Pradip Ghosh has filed his nomination for both seats. Fellow councillor Santosh Pathak has entered the fray in Bowbazar as a substitute candidate.         
	The party said the substitute was to pressure Mamata into sparing one seat for the Congress. If one of her nominees pulls out, Ghosh will be the Congresss first choice. If she doesnt budge, Ghosh will contest from Sealdah and Pathak from Bowbazar.        
	We have fielded Ghosh from Sealdah on the assumption that Mamata will finally give the seat to us, said state Congress working president Subrata Mukherjee.         
	Fielding candidates for both the seats, the Congress has shown its intent to confront Mamata. But whether it will stick to the fight, jeopardising the alliance right after the Lok Sabha polls, will be known only on August 1, the last day for withdrawal of nominations.        
	Congress leaders said discussions with Mamata would continue. As a national party, we cannot sit idle. Talks with Mamataji are on, though we have put up candidates for both Sealdah and Bowbazar. We are still requesting her to offer us at least one seat since both the places are traditional Congress bases, general secretary K. Keshava Rao said over the phone from Delhi.         
	But indications from the Trinamul camp are that she is unlikely to concede ground to the Congress in the heart of Calcutta.         
	I dont think she will offer any of the two seats to the Congress. Although Somen Mitra and Sudip Bandopadhyay had won Sealdah and Bowbazar as Congress candidates in 2006, they have become MPs on Trinamul tickets in 2009. We have a legitimate claim to both the seats, said a Trinamul general secretary.        
	But the Congresss assertiveness comes in the wake of a changed scenario. The party has emerged stronger after the Lok Sabha polls and its leaders would like to use the success at the national level to rebuild the organisation in Bengal.        
	In both Sealdah and Bow- bazar, Congress workers pressured the brass to put up candidates. The high command, too, wants a fresh start for the party in Bengal.         
	Not that the Congress wants to break the alliance at this stage, but it also does not want the tie-up to shackle its revival.

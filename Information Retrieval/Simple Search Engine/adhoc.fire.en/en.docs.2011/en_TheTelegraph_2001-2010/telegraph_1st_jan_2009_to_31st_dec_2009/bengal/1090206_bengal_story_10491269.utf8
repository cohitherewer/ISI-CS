The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | In Pintail, with counter agenda 
                                                                                                               In Pintail, with counter agenda 
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Siliguri, Feb. 5: The CPMs Darjeeling district committee members had a meeting in front of Pintail Village this afternoon, the same time when the Gorkha Janmukti Morcha was holding a prayer session inside.         
	While senior leaders of the district CPM like S.P. Lepcha, Jibitesh Sarkar, Ajit Sarkar and Siliguri Mahakuma Parishad sabhadhipati Mani Thapa appealed to the hill party to refrain from demanding a separate state, the Morcha prayed for the success of its movement.        
	We have organised this special prayer, which was prescheduled, for our supporters, who are currently on hunger strike at Gorubathan. Besides, the prayer is also to help us achieve Gorkhaland, said Sujit Karkidoli, a central committee members of Morcha at Pintail Village on the outskirts of Siliguri.        
	The condition of seven more Morcha supporters on hunger strike in Gorubathan since January 29 has deteriorated, the block medical officer of health, D. Biswas, attending to them, said today.         
	This takes the total number of protesters whose condition has turned serious to 13. Yesterday, Biswas had said the health condition of five was serious.         
	Of the 22 Morcha supporters who are on fast, five joined on February 1.         
	Outside Pintail, the CPM leaders spoke against the Morcha demand for Gorkhaland.        
	We supported Bimal Gurung, when he spoke to the media in his mother tongue, Nepali. But at the same time I would like to remind him that it was the late Ratanlal Brahmin, a district CPM leader, who first raised the demand for the recognition of the language in the Constitution. Now Gurung is ignoring his (Brahmins) party, Sarkar told a gathering of more than 2,000 supporters.        
	Lepcha, who is the secretary of the district CPM, said: The Morcha is claiming that the separate statehood will come in a couple of years. But how can they say that when it is not yet decided who will run the central government in the next couple of months.        
	Nearly 100 policemen had been deployed at the grounds where the meeting was held this afternoon.         
	Some of the tea garden workers from the Citu affiliated Darjeeling Jila Chia Kaman Mazdoor Union attended the meeting with bow and arrow.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Morcha ends fast
                                                                                                               Morcha ends fast
  - Talks with CM very fruitful: Hill outfit        OUR BUREAU                                    
	Feb. 13: The Gorkha Janmukti Morcha called off its 16-day-old hunger strike today after the government gave a written commitment to consider five of its six demands.        
	In a letter to Morcha president Bimal Gurung, home secretary Ardhendu Sen expressed the governments inability to allow the hill outfit to hold public meetings in the Dooars.        
	The Morcha said the government had agreed to reopen three of the 13 closed tea gardens in the Dooars within three months. It has promised to look into the legalities of transferring the ownership of the other closed gardens, said its spokesperson Binay Tamang.        
	Tamang said the government was also willing to consider running the estates by forming workers co-operatives.         
	The aid for workers of closed gardens will be raised from Rs 750 a month, he added.        
	Morcha tom-tommed the promises as its victory. What the so-called leaders of the Terai, Siliguri and the Dooars were not able to do all this while, we have in two months.         
	Tamang added that the government had promised to review the hill outfits demand to drop cases against Morcha supporters in the plains and to arrest the Adivasi leaders accused of triggering clashes. After our meeting with the chief minister yesterday, Sunil Pradhan was granted bail today.        
	The Yuva Morchas Kalimpong president was held dur- ing the January 16 clash in Malbazar, Jalpaiguri, and booked under the arms act.         
	Morcha supporters had been fasting in batches at Gorubathan, on the edge of the Dooars near Kalimpong, since January 29. A dozen of them had to be hospitalised.        
	In Calcutta, Sen said: I had written to them, saying we would pay compensation to those whose property had been destroyed in the clashes in the Dooars and Terai. I also conveyed to them the chief ministers concern about the fast.        
	Tamang said the Morchas meeting with the chief minister had been very fruitful.         
	The party said tonight government offices would be allowed to work from Monday. But a strike will still be in force in offices that collect revenues, like those of the state power utility and the transport office.

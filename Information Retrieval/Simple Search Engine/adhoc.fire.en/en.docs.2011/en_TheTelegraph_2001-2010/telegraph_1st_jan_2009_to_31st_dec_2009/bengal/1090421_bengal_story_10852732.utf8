The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Meeting on Lalgarh tangle tomorrow 
                                                                                                               Meeting on Lalgarh tangle tomorrow 
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Calcutta, April 20: The state government and the poll panel will meet the tribal leadership of Lalgarh on Wednesday and sympathetically consider its demands to ensure peaceful elections on April 30.        
	The Peoples Committee Against Police Atrocities had faxed a letter to the states chief electoral officer yesterday with the request that a tripartite meeting be convened and the government sympathetically consider its demands.         
	Depending on the governments response, the committee will decide whether to allow central forces to enter Lalgarh on polling day.         
	The government today agreed to hear the committee out but ruled out accepting at least one of the demands: to make a former West Midnapore police chief apologise for alleged atrocities during raids in search of Maoists last November. It remained mum on another: drop all cases against suspected Maoists since 1998.        
	After a meeting with state chief secretary Asok Mohan Chakrabarti and chief electoral officer Debashis Sen, home secretary Ardhendu Sen said: The (committees) letter says if the demands are considered, the polls will be allowed in the presence of central forces. We will attend the meeting on April 22, consider their issues and try to ensure peaceful elections in Lalgarh.        
	He added: Theres no question of the West Midnapore SP tendering an apology for the alleged atrocities.        
	The chief electoral officer, the election observer for the Jhargram parliamentary seat of which Lalgarh is a part, the district magistrate and superintendent of police will attend Wednesdays meeting in Midnapore town. The special secretaries of the home, rural development and backward classes departments will also be there.        
	According to the home secretary, it is not that the committee wants all its demands met by April 30. It wants the dialogue process to begin and we will respond to that. The organisation doesnt expect its issues to be resolved before the elections in Lalgarh. Thats why we are hopeful of a solution to the stalemate.        
	The committee, suspected to be backed by Maoist guerrillas, has been resisting security forces in Lalgarh since November. The government and the Election Commission have made it clear that the polls have to be conducted and they cant be held without the police.        
	Asked about the possible outcome of the meeting, Debashis Sen said: Well go to the meeting with an open mind. Ill visit Midnapore tomorrow and speak to the district administration. Ill also ask the candidates from Jhargram to offer their views on the Lalgarh situation at a separate meeting on Wednesday.        
	What if the meeting fails? The officer said: The EC is insistent on conducting the elections without violence. The committees letter probably indicates that its willing to allow the polls through a dialogue and without preconditions.

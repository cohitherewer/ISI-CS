                                                                                                               Rural scam
                            
	Burdwan, Aug. 12: CPM leaders of a third Burdwan panchayat have been accused of making false entries in job cards and forging bills to siphon off wages under the rural employment guarantee scheme.        
	At Chhora, the allegations were the same as in Baidyanathpur and Kendra, 10km away.        
	A villager, Shibu Bagdi, said the books showed he was employed for 30 days, though he had worked for 10. His wages had been withdrawn from his post office account, allegedly by the leaders.        
	Villagers ransacked a CPM leaders home last night and beat up another party man.         
	An FIR has been lodged by the administration against the Baidyanathpur panchayat leaders. A probe is on in Kendra.

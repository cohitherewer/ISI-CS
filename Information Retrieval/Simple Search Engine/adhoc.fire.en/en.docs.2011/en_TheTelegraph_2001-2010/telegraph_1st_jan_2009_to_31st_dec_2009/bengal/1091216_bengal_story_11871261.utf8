The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Singur letter to railways
                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      Singur letter to railways
                            
	Calcutta, Dec. 15: The government will write to the railways within a day or two seeking clarifications about its proposed coach factory in Singur.         
	Well seek details, including whether the railways were seeking a joint venture and what they exactly wanted to do. Unless we have a specific proposal, it is difficult to initiate talks with the Tatas on the (return of the) land, chief secretary Asok Mohan Chakrabarti said. He added that the talks with the Tatas could begin only when the state had a definite proposal in hand. Only if the railways decide to set up an industry (on the abandoned Tata project site) in Singur, can we initiate talks with the Tatas.         
	The government will also have to talk to investors in the vendor park supposed to come up on the Tata site.

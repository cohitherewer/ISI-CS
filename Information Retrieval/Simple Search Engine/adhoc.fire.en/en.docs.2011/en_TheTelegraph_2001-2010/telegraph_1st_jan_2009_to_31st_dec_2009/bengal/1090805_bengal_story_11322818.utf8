          SOUMEN BHATTACHARJEE                          A villager with sacks of foodgrain meant for Aila relief at his home in Dhamakhali. Telegraph picture                                  
	Dhamakhali, Aug. 4: In this North 24-Parganas village ravaged by cyclone Aila in May, relief is aplenty now because its residents are helping themselves with what isnt theirs.        
	When aid agencies had brought relief to the area in the immediate aftermath of the disaster and found it difficult to reach the interiors, many of the residents of Dhamakhali volunteered to help.        
	A month and a half on, the rice, pulses, milk and bottled drinking water left behind by NGOs and other organisations for distribution are serving Dhamakhali even as tens of villages at a distance are living under tarpaulin sheds without two square meals.        
	Stacks of gunny bags and cartons are now a usual sight across the village in Sandeshkhali, about 70km northeast of Calcutta.        
	The huge stock of food has apparently made the villagers reluctant to work. And the government is struggling to find local labourers to repair the 90km embankment whose breaches had flooded the village two months ago.        
	I have enough rice and dal to feed my family of six for several months? said Santanu Mondal, in his early 30s.         
	Through the breached embankments, fingerlings flow into the water bodies in the village during high tide and we earn about Rs 150 a day selling them. So why should we break our backs repairing embankments?         
	The government offers Rs 81 a day for the repair work it hopes to complete with the help of the villagers.        
	In Sandeshkhali, the last point on the mainland is Dhamakhali. Then on, the area is riverine and dotted with numerous islands, each with around 3,000 families.        
	Bikash Das of Dhamakhali said the villagers could be tempted to work if the government raised the wages to at least Rs 100 a day. We have no fear of starving as we have plenty of food with us. So we are busy catching the fingerlings, which bring us more money. If we have to work, we should be paid at least Rs 100, said Bikash, also an electrician.         
	By his own admission, there is about 500kg of rice and 100kg of dal at his home. We had thought of reaching the relief to the remote areas but changed our mind as we are also victims, Bikash added.        
	In the Sandeshkhali III CPM local committee office, cartons of packaged drinking water bottles were stocked inside. A local CPM leader, Haribilas Singha, said: Many organisations had left their relief materials in our office. Some people may have kept the water for distribution later.        
	One of the agencies The Telegraph spoke to explained why they were forced to leave their aid at Dhamakhali. We had taken about 1,200kg of rice and 450kg of dal, said Tapan Biswas of the Sodepur Residents Welfare Association        
	We realised wed need mechanised boats to travel 25-30km. It was difficult for us to travel to those remote villages, distribute the relief and return the same evening. Also, boats were scarce. So when the villagers promised to distribute the relief on our behalf, we thought it was welcome.        
	The administration expressed concern over the reluctance of the villagers to work on the dykes. When contractors brought labourers from outside, the villagers resisted them, said Subhojit Mondal, the Sandeshkhali II block development officer. Police had to be deployed at two places.        
	However, in villages like Monirampur, Boyramari, Kalitala and Jogeshgunj, many are still praying for Aila relief.         
	Ironically, the BDO said he did not have enough relief to distribute to all affected areas. It would have been better if we had more relief. We trying our best.         
	A district official said there was no account of how much relief had been taken to Sandeshkhali by the private organisations. There may be relief stocked up in some villages. But no organisation has complained to us that their relief has not been distributed, said the official.

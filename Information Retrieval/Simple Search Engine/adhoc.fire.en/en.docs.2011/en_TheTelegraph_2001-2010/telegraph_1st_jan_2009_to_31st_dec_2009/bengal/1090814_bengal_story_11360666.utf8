The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Mollah rail job challenge to Mamata
                                                                                                               Mollah rail job challenge to Mamata
          A STAFF REPORTER                          Mollah at the programme. (Sanjoy Chattopadhyaya)                                  
	Calcutta, Aug. 13: CPM minister Abdur Rezzak Mollah today challenged Mamata Banerjee to provide thousands of railway jobs to Muslims and said he would join her party if she did.         
	Speaking at a programme organised by a minority institution at the Science City auditorium, Mollah said he was aware of eight lakh vacancies in the railways.         
	If Mamata Banerjee really cares about Muslims, as I am told she does, why doesnt she give some of these jobs to Muslim youths, said the land and land reforms minister.         
	He challenged Mamata to recruit Muslims in at least 30 per cent of the even two lakh posts he surmised would surely be filled. That way, 60,000 of you will get railway jobs and I will seriously consider switching to the other side (the Trinamul Congress), he said to a ripple of laughter from Aliah University students in the packed auditorium.        
	Chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee, among the dignitaries present on the dais, was seen smiling with the others when Mollah made the remarks.         
	Sources in the Railway Board said from Delhi there were only around 1.5 lakh vacancies at the moment. Examinations are held periodically. Recruitment is a continuous process, an official said.        
	Trinamul trashed Mollahs challenge. They (CPM leaders) are talking nonsense ever since they lost a string of elections, said state party president Subrata Bakshi.        
	Muslims disenchantment with the CPM is believed to be one of the reasons for its successive poll debacles.         
	The Sachar committee had pointed out that the representation of Muslims in Bengal government jobs was abysmal even after 33 years of Left rule.        
	Todays event was the inauguration of a skill development programme for minorities organised by the university, a state-funded minority institution that now operates from Salt Lake. The government is scouting for land for its campus in South 24-Parganas.        
	Under the programme, students will will be given vocational training in collaboration with private companies. They will have to pay only 10 per cent of the course fees.         
	The government will pay the rest, a move being seen as part of its bid to improve its image among Muslims.

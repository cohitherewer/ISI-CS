                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      Splinter relief for Priyanka
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Calcutta, Dec. 24: A CT scan has revealed that there are no bomb splinters lodged in Priyanka Goldars body.        
	Last night, a CT scan was done for the first time since Sunday, when Priyanka was injured in an attack in Habra.        
	The CT scan showed that there is no splinter. However, there is an injury in the front part of the right shoulder near the joint, said Mansoor Mumtaz, a surgeon at a private nursing home in Kidderpore, where Priyanka was shifted on Tuesday night from RG Kar Medical College and Hospital.         
	The skin and tissues have been damaged near the shoulder joint. A minor surgery will be performed, said Mumtaz.         
	Earlier, doctors at RG Kar had suspected that there were several splinters lodged inside. The X-ray showed some impressions which looked like splinters. We recommended CT scan, but didnt have the time to get it done as the family had taken her away, said A. Bandopadhyay, an orthopaedic surgeon at RG Kar hospital.         
	Priyankas family was relieved to know she would not need any major surgery. I thank my stars that she will not have to undergo a big operation. Priyanka was very scared yesterday about this, said Iti Goldar, her mother. I am quite relieved.         
	Iti had fainted at RG Kar hospital she had been so worried. These few days will haunt me throughout my life.         
	Doctors said Priyankas condition had improved and she had no problem in moving her right hand and shoulder. She also had normal food.

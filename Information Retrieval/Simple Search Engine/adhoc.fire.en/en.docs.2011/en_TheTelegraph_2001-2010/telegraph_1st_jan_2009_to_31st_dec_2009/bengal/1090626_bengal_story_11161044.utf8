The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Wanted: Lalgarh spy
                                                                                                               Wanted: Lalgarh spy
          IMRAN AHMED SIDDIQUI                              
	Lalgarh, June 25: Police are on a recruitment overdrive in Lalgarh to gather intelligence on the Maoists and their local collaborators.         
	The salary is negotiable but the job comes with a perk, a prepaid cellphone connection.         
	We have got 50 people, but we need more, said a senior state police officer.         
	The first batch of recruits  selected primarily from villages near Lalgarh thana  have already started working. They have got their phones and list of officers with whom they should be in touch.         
	Lower-rung policemen in Lalgarh and Goaltore are helping the officers identify the potential candidates.        
	Convincing them to work for us is a challenge as they are wary of getting identified. We have told them that they wont have to come to the thana or meet a policeman, said the officer.         
	According to him, the lure of a fixed salary  which he refused to divulge  and immunity from police action helped in getting the first 50 on board.         
	The officers in charge of Lalgarh and Goaltore thanas have briefed them about their mandate  tracking the movement of the Maoists, gathering information in advance on meetings between the rebels and Peoples Committee leaders and locating houses where arms and ammunition have been stored.         
	Senior state and central force officers had told The Telegraph the biggest handicap was lack of intelligence inputs.         
	Although the forces have taken position in Lalgarh and Goaltore in West Midnapore and Sarenga in Bankura, they havent been able to move into the core areas in the absence of credible information on where the Maoists could be holed up. It will be suicidal to enter the core areas without proper intelligence, said a central force officer.         
	Till November, local CPM cadres were the primary source of information for the district intelligence branch and the intelligence bureau. The network collapsed after the Maoists started ruling the region.         
	Unless we have local sources, it is going to be extremely difficult to identify the Maoists, who have mingled with the villagers, explained a senior officer.         
	The job for the new recruits would not be easy. Although these men are from Lalgarh, we havent got people from the core area. Those villages are still out of bounds, said the officer.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | DNA test clears man, but rape slur sticks
                                                                                                               DNA test clears man, but rape slur sticks
          ALAMGIR HOSSAIN                              
	Behrampore, Feb. 16: A young man accused of raping a girl over four years ago and making her pregnant has not been let off by the court even after a DNA test confirmed that the child was not his.         
	Nilkantha Roy Chatterjee, now 30, obtained bail from Calcutta High Court on the basis of the DNA report almost three years ago, but his rape case is yet to be disposed of by a fast-track court in Behrampore.        
	As a result, Nilkantha, who was suspended from his job as a casual employee at the district magistrates office in the town, about 200km from Calcutta, is still jobless.        
	A resident of Haridasmati village near Behrampore, Nilkantha was arrested on September 23, 2004. His neighbours 17-year-old daughter, who was already four months pregnant, had accused him of rape.         
	A year later, the case was referred to the fast-track court, which ordered the DNA test. The Central Forensic Science Laboratory in Calcutta conducted the test in early 2006.         
	The report proved my innocence, I was immediately released on bail. But I cant get my job until I am absolved of the charge, said Nilkantha.         
	His lawyer Joydeb Mondal said the case came up for hearing at least 10 times in the past three years, but it was not heard on many occasions. Twice the judge was transferred. The government lawyer wanted it put off on a few occasions and also sought a second DNA test, which was rejected. Ironically, Mondal, too, had sought a deferment.        
	Two days ago, Nilkantha submitted an appeal to the di-strict magistrate, requesting him to ensure that the hearing of the case was speeded up.        
	He said he was in distress. My father is a retired group D employee of a college. Me, my mother and father barely make ends meet with his meagre pension. I need my job back.        
	According to a Supreme Court directive, a fast-track court should dispose of a case within two-and-a-half years.        
	The governments lawyer, Soibendranath Sarkar, said though the DNA test had been negative, he could prove Nilkantha guilty. The negative test does not mean the accused will be let off. It is my duty to get him punished, said the additional public prosecutor.        
	Calcutta-based lawyer Jayanta N. Chatterjee said: The DNA test has proved that the accused did not father the petitioners child. This may not mean he has not raped her. A court of law has to complete trial whenever a girl alleges rape. There is a Supreme Court directive to this effect.        
	The government lawyer pleaded ignorance about the cause of the delay. I want the case to be disposed of fast, too.         
	In Bengal, around 17 lakh cases are pending in subordinate courts.

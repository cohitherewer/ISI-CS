The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Trinamul threat to PM plan
                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      Trinamul threat to PM plan
  - Union minister cites land hurdle to nuke plant          OUR CORRESPONDENT                          Russian President Dmitry Medvedev and Prime Minister Manmohan Singh at the Kremlin. (PTI)                                        
	Tamluk, Dec. 8: Trinamul Congress minister Sisir Adhikari said his party would not allow land acquisition for the nuclear power plant in East Midnapores Haripur, a day after Prime Minister Manmo- han Singh spoke of the project following what was hailed as a path-breaking civilian nuclear deal with Moscow.        
	Adhikari, the Union min-ister of state for rural development, said the land was multi-crop and alleged that the state government had misled the Centre about its nature while conveying its eagerness for the project.         
	Asked about Singhs reference to a site in Bengal, he said: The Left Front government has furnished wrong data to the Prime Minister. Haripur is a place that has three- and four-crop land. Moreover, a few thousand fishermen live there. So, the question of building a nuclear reactor in Haripur does not arise.         
	Although the Prime Minister did not mention any specific place, the name Haripur had been doing the rounds ever since the project was mooted in 2006. A central team had visited Haripur, drawing protests from a section of the villagers.        
	A Trinamul delegation will meet the Prime Minister on Thursday or Friday to submit a proper set of facts. We will request the Prime Minister to shift the location (of the proposed plant), added Adhikari, who represents the region in the Lok Sabha.        
	His son Subhendu, who had spearheaded Trinamuls Nandigram agitation and is now the MP from a neighbouring constituency, will lead the team that will call on Singh.         
	In November 2006, central officials who had gone to Haripur for a reconnaissance had to return to Calcutta because of the resistance to the proposed project.        
	As a policy, the Congress is opposed to the acquisition of multi-crop land. The dilemma in the state Congress on whether or not to oppose the Haripur project was apparent today. State party working president Pradip Bhattacharya said: At our chintan baithak in Krishnagar, we decided that industry should come up on single-crop or infertile land. We are yet to verify whether Haripur has three-crop land.         
	It is the state governme- nts responsibility to earmark less fertile land for the project, he added.        
	Sources said that when the Centre informed the state government in June 2006 of the plan to set up a nuclear reactor in Bengal, Writers Buildings picked Haripur because of its proximity to the sea.         
	We informed Delhi that land for such a project was available in East Midnapore but did not, and nor were we asked to, specify the nature of it, an official said.         
	In June 2006, land had not become an issue. Only in September that year, when the government acquired land for Tata Motors in Singur, did it take on an emotive appeal.         
	According to junior Union rural development minister Adhikari, the state government had never sought the opinion of the Trinamul-run East Midnapore zilla parishad on whether to proceed with the project.        
	Haripur has a high population density. The CPM is playing politics by forcibly trying to get the site cleared for the project. They are trying to drive a wedge between us and the Congress by supporting the project as they know we are against it, he added.        
	A Trinamul-backed resis- tance group, formed in Hari- pur, met today and decided not to allow the project under any circumstances.        
	Any visit by a government delegation for an assessment of the site will be resisted. If necessary, roads will be dug up as in Nandigram to prevent their entry, said a leader of the Bhite Mati Jibon Jibika Banchao (Save Farmland and Livelihood) Committee.        
	Haripur falls under the Majila gram panchayat, which is controlled by the Socialist Party, a Left Front partner.         
	But we got more votes than the Left here in this years parliamentary elections and the bypolls that followed, said a Trinamul district leader.        
	People from some 50 villages have apparently joined the protest, apprehending a threat to farming and fishing.

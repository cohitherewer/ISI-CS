The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Tuition row in school
                                                                                                               Tuition row in school
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Durgapur, Oct. 29: Around half of the 1,200 students at St Xaviers Durgapur are staring at a month out of classes for taking tuition from the schools teachers.        
	Headmaster Fr K.K. Devasy went to each section of Classes V to X yesterday and announced that those who had been violating the schools long-standing ban on such tuition were being suspended for a month. He did not single out any student, nor did he have any suspension notice put up, but the move sparked a parents backlash.         
	Nearly 200 guardians demonstrated at the school today, with some storming Devasys chamber and jostling with teachers who tried to stop them.        
	It is not clear how many would be covered by the verbal suspension, but at least 600 of the schools 1,200 students are said to take tuition from the teachers.        
	In the face of the protest, Devasy allowed the students whose guardians demonstrated to attend classes today, but did not say what would happen from tomorrow. A half-hour meeting he held with the guardians ended without any solution.         
	The school diary specifies that such tuition is banned  both for students and teachers  but some guardians said it had been a practice for long and the school had never taken such action. The diary says: Teachers are not allowed to give tuition for our schoolchildren. Students, too, are not allowed to take tuition from our schoolteachers. Those found guilty will be dismissed from the school.        
	Partha Ghosh, whose son is in Class VIII and takes tuition from the English teacher, demanded action against the teachers, too. We asked the headmaster why only students would be punished. But he remained silent on the teachers.        
	Officials of Asansol Diocese, of which the St Xaviers is a part, were not available for comment. But officials of Calcutta Diocese, under which St Xaviers Calcutta falls, made it clear that such tuition was forbidden in its schools.

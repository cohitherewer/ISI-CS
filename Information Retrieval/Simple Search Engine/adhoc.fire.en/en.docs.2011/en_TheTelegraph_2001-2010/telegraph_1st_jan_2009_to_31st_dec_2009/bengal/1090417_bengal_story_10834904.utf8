The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Practice rule for judicial exams 
                                                                                                               Practice rule for judicial exams 
          A LEGAL REPORTER                              
	Calcutta, April 16: Calcutta High Court today ruled that people who have law degrees but were pursuing full-time jobs in other sectors would not be eligible to sit for the state judicial services examinations.        
	The ruling came on an appeal by the Calcutta High Court administration which challenged a judgment by Justice S.P. Talukdar.        
	The judge had held that people with law degrees but holding jobs in other sectors could sit for judicial service examinations and become judges in subordinate courts.        
	But the division bench of Justice P.K. Roy and Justice S. K. Gupta today said: According to the provisions of the Judicial Services Examinations Recruitment Rules, only advocates who have been practising in courts for at least three years are eligible to appear for the examinations.         
	Advocates are lawyers who are engaged only in the legal profession. When an advocate decides to join another profession, he has to return his advocates certificate to the state bar council.         
	The division bench said: Persons possessing law degrees but holding full-time jobs in other professions cannot be termed advocates. So, they have no right to sit for the examination for recruitment as lower court judges.        
	In 2007, Subhashish Muhuri, a high court employee, was not allowed to sit for the judicial exam by the high court administration because he was not a practising lawyer. The same year, Sankar Das, an additional public prosecutor in Bankura (additional public prosecutors are considered full-time state employees) was allowed to sit for the exam and cleared it. But he was declined the job of a junior judge.        
	Both Muhuri and Das moved the high court to challenge the decisions. Justice Talukdar asked the authorities to allow Muhuri to sit for exam and appoint Das to the post of a lower court judge. The high court administration appealed against these orders.

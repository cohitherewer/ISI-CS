	Calcutta, Dec. 11: Fisheries minister Kiranmoy Nanda today said he had never described chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee as Mohammad bin Tughlaq.        
	I have never said our chief minister is Mohammad bin Tughlaq. If you want to put words into my mouth, I would say the Prime Minister and all Congress chief ministers are like Tughlaq, Nanda said when a Congress leader questioned his purported remarks.         
	In Malda a few days ago, the minister had said: The government has lost all control over the situation. It seems it is being run by Mohammad bin Tughlaq. The sultan is legendary for hasty decisions that cost him dear.

                                                                                                               Cops shoot rebel, committee threatens attack     -  Maoist held after 7-hour fight
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                          The injured Maoist in Midnapore Medical College and Hospital. (Samir Mondal)                                        
	Midnapore, Oct. 26: The Peoples Committee Against Police Atrocities exhorted supporters to attack government offices on a day security forces captured an injured Maoist guerrilla near Lalgarh after a 1000-bullet fight.        
	The security forces have unleashed a reign of terror. They are torturing people. We have called an indefinite bandh in West Midnapore district from tomorrow and asked our supporters to dig up roads and block them with trees. Weve also told them to loot government offices in West Midnapore, Bankura and Purulia, said Asit Mahato, the committee spokesman after Chhatradhar Mahatos arrest.        
	The tribal resistance group today confirmed that its activities were no different from those of its Maoist drivers. Our supporters will loot police stations, block and panchayat offices and other govern-ment establishments. We will arm them with weapons robbed from CPM goons, Asit said. That is also how the guerrillas work.         
	We will carry on with our movement till the forces are withdrawn from Lalgarh, Asit added.        
	West Midnapore superintendent of police Manoj Verma said the forces were prepared to deal with the threat. All police stations and central force officers have been alerted.        
	Around 1,000 jawans of the Central Reserve Police Force, Border Security Force and state police split into teams around 5.30am today and zeroed in on a forest village called Bakshi following intelligence that guerrilla leader Kishanji could be holed up there. The place is about 35km from Sankrail, where the guerrillas last week looted a bank, killed two sub-inspectors and took their officer hostage.        
	It is a small hamlet where only a dozen families live. Abducted Sankrail OC Atindranath Dutta had apparently been kept there the night before his release, an officer said.        
	A team advancing towards Bakshi from the south was the first to be fired at. After an hours shootout, the Maoists tried to withdraw towards the north. But they were cut off by another group and another hour-long encounter ensued, a CRPF officer said. The rebels then tried to flee through the jungles in the east but met with resistance there too.        
	Although almost cornered, the guerrillas managed to give the forces the slip apparently because of their better knowledge of the topography.        
	Around 1pm, the shooting from their side stopped. We were close to Bakshi, but the Maoists had fled, superintendent Verma said.        
	The bleeding rebel was picked up from a forest after the seven-hour encounter in which the police said at least 1,000 bullets and mortar shells were fired. Sahebram Murmu, 22, was writhing in pain with a bullet in his abdomen.        
	Four others have been picked up from the village for alleged Maoist links.        
	CPM leader killed        
	A CPM gram panchayat member was was shot dead in Binpur this afternoon. Pratap Nayek, 45, who had fled home three months ago following Maoist threats, had returned only two days ago.

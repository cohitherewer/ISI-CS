                                                                                                               Pak spy set free
                            
	Darjeeling, Oct. 30: A Pakistani accused of being an ISI operative was today absolved of the charge after seven years in jail.        
	When Mohammad Dilshad was held in 2002, police had paraded him as a big fish who was here to recruit Indian agents for the ISI. He was charged with passing on classified information and under the explosive substances act.        
	The Darjeeling district and sessions judge said the police could not prove the charges. But he was convinced about Dilshads nationality and ordered his deportation.        
	Dilshad, 39, said he was an Indian and would appeal the deportation order. I was born in Mumbai and grew up there. My wife is from Delhi.        
	The court found him guilty of overstaying but he has already served more than the five years he would have got under the Foreigners Act.

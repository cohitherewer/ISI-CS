	Durgapur, Sept. 10: An 18-year-old school dropout who has been arrested in Ranchi for kidnapping a Durgapur businessman has told police his father taught him to carry out abductions.         
	Pritam Singh, 18, arrested on Tuesday on the outskirts of Ranchi, is the son of Bihar-based kidnapper Upender Singh, who is absconding. Pritam had kidnapped Santanu Mukherjee from Durgapur in December.        
	The teenager, arrested on Tuesday, told the police he had learnt to handle pistols and revolvers when he was 16.        
	Upender told his son that before every abduction, the target should be closely watched. The abductor must know the routine of his would-be victim, places he visits, his friends and food habits, Pritam told a police officer.        
	Officers said Pritam began to keep a watch on Santanu from November last year.         
	After kidnapping the businessman, Pritam took him to Ramgarh, near Ranchi, after dumping the businessmans Honda City at Bokaro station. In Ramgarh, he was kept in a house in a deserted place, arranged by Upender, said the officer. It was Pritam who masterminded the abduction on December 30 last year.         
	Pritam and his associates, clad in police uniform, abducted Santanu in a Bolero while he was returning from a pub in his new Honda City on the night of December 30.        
	He was released after his family paid a hefty ransom, the amount of which neither the family nor the police have disclosed.

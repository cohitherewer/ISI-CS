	Calcutta, April 5: A Calcutta police team has picked up Mohammed Shahnaz, in his 20s, from Lalgola, Murshidabad, on charges of having links with Pakistan-trained terrorists who had sneaked into India from Bangladesh.         
	The police said Shahnazs name had emerged during the interrogation of Abu Taher, the alleged explosives expert said to have undergone the same training at Muridke near Lahore as 26/11 accused Ajmal Kasab. Taher was held in Calcutta last month.         
	Shahnaz had allegedly found Taher a hideout after he crossed the border.         
	A special task force team raided his home this morning. He was brought to Calcutta in the afternoon. He used to provide logistics support to terrorists coming from Bangladesh, an officer said.

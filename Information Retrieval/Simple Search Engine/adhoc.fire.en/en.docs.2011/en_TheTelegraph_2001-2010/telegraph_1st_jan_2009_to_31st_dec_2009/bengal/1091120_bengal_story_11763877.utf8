	Burdwan, Nov. 19: A couple in Burdwan have been accused of smothering their three-month-old daughter and dumping her in a pond because they already had a girl.        
	Police said Bikash Chanda, 37, and his wife Jhuma, 32, had confessed to pressing a pillow on their babys face.         
	Other residents of Kamarhati village, on the outskirts of Burdwan town, about 145km from Calcutta, yesterday found the body floating in the pond in the Chandas backyard.         
	Bikash, a carpenter, and his wife were arrested today after several hours of interrogation. Initially, they said their daughter had slipped into the pond, but broke down in the course of the interrogation, said Biswajit Das, the officer in charge of Madhavdihi police station.         
	The Chandas five-year-old daughter Madhurima has been sent to her maternal uncles place at Raina, around 15km away.        
	At Kamarhati, a neighbour said the couple fought regularly since the birth of their second daughter.

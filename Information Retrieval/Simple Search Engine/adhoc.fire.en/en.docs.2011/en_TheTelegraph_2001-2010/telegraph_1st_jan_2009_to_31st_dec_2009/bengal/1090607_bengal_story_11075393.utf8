	Howrah, June 6: An IPS officer has been accused of tor- turing his eight-year-old domestic help, who tried to flee his Sankrail house today.         
	Basudeb Bag is a DIG posted at Writers. We are conducting an inquiry, said Surajit Kar Purakayastha, inspector-general, south Bengal.         
	The police had first refused to lodge an FIR when local people went to lodge a complaint with the girl. Bag has refused comment.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Alliance talks with Mamata on March 7
                                                                                                               Alliance talks with Mamata on March 7
          BARUN GHOSH                              
	Calcutta, Feb. 24: Congress general secretary K. Keshava Rao will be in Calcutta on March 7 to discuss with Mamata Banerjee a possible alliance ahead of the Lok Sabha polls.        
	My primary job will be to speak to Mamataji on the alli-ance, Rao, the Congress cent- ral leader in charge of Bengal, said from Delhi.        
	The high command has done its bit for the tie-up by withdrawing our nominee for the Bishnupur West bypoll in support of Mamatajis candidate. My job will be to carry it forward when I go to Calcutta on March 7, he added.         
	The alliance with the Trinamul Congress, he felt, would help the Congress emerge a viable alternative to the CPM in Bengal.        
	I have gathered that the Opposition fared phenomenally in last years rural polls because of a united Opposition, Rao said.         
	The two parties did not have a formal pact last May but it is widely believed that they had a general understanding at the grassroots for many of the seats.        
	Trinamul state president Subrata Bakshi said: Our doors are always open to the Congress. Rao is welcome to speak to Mamata.        
	Party sources said Mamata was in touch with Ahmed Patel, Congress president Sonia Gandhis political secretary.         
	Didi is waiting for the Bishnupur West bypoll result on March 1. She will talk to the Congress leadership after seeing the victory margin of our man, Madan Mitra, said a Trinamul general secretary.        
	The state Congress is also waiting for March 1.         
	Madan had lost by 4,000 votes in 2006 when the Congress bagged 15,000 votes. If he wins by a decent margin this time, we will be able to claim credit for it and bargain harder with Mamata for more Lok Sabha seats, a state Congress leader said.         
	Rao refused to comment on seat sharing with Mamata at this juncture. Lets reach the talks table first. Then we can settle everything gradually.         
	The AICC leader said he would speak to grassroots-level party workers to get his finger on the mood in the state unit before going to meet Mamata. I shall not restrict myself to talking to state-level leaders. I want to meet our grassroots-level leaders to get a feel about the proposed alliance, he said.        
	Asked about state Congress president and senior Union minister Pranab Mukherjees recent barbs at Mamatas anti-industrialisation agitation, Trinamuls Bakshi said: Such things are common in politics.

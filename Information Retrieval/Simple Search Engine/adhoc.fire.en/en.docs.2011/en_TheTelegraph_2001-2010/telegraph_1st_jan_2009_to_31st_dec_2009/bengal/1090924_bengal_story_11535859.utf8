The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Govt trips on teachers
                                                                                                               Govt trips on teachers
          OUR LEGAL REPORTER                           PTTI candidates protest in Suri. File picture                                  
	Calcutta, Sept 23: A legal oversight by the Bengal government has put paid to its plans of immediately recruiting teachers to fill up 54,000 vacant teaching posts in state-aided primary schools.        
	Calcutta High Court today ruled that the state government would have to put the brakes on recruiting teachers on the basis of a notification it had issued in August and instead give priority to those teacher aspirants who had applied in 2006 but had not got jobs.        
	In 2006, the state government had issued a notification seeking application for jobs of primary school teachers and stated that those holding certificates from primary teachers training institutes (PTTI) would get 22 grace marks in the test comprising 100 marks.        
	In Bengal, most PTTIs do not have approval from the National Council for Teachers Education, something which is mandatory nationally.        
	So, in 2006 itself an aggrieved party filed a PIL in the high court which responded by ruling that all certificates issued by PTTIs that do not have NCTE approval are invalid.        
	Since most of the candidates who had applied for jobs and had appeared for the appointment test had PTTI certificates from institutions that did not have approval of the NCTE, the government put the entire appointment process on hold, but did not cancel the notification seeking applications for jobs as primary teachers.        
	But with pressure to fill up primary schools vacancies piling up, in August this year the state government issued another notification seeking job applications but did not give preference to PTTI certificate holders.         
	However, some candidates who had applied in 2006, moved the high court stating that since the earlier notification of 2006 was not cancelled, the new notification was illegal.        
	Today, a single-judge bench, in an interim order, said the government should first consider the candidates who had applied in 2006 before moving ahead with the new notification. However, it gave the government the option of moving a division bench against todays order within a month.         
	The government has not yet cancelled the 2006 recruitment notification, Justice S. Pal said. The candidates who sought jobs in 2006 will have to be considered first.         
	Advocate Kalyan Banerjee, who appeared on behalf of the 2006 candidates, said: My submission was that since the government neither cancelled the 2006 notification nor declared that the appointment process had been abandoned, it has no authority to issue a new notification seeking applications for jobs in primary schools.         
	Advocate-general Balai Ray admitted that the order had put his government in a legal problem. We will move the division bench, he said.

	Durgapur, Sept. 5: Leaders of a CPM-run Burdwan rural body who allegedly furnished bogus work and wage details for Rs 11 lakh under the rural job scheme, paid only Rs 2.5 lakh to villagers in two months.         
	Burdwan district authorities revealed the figures while probing the irregularities in the implementation of the National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme in Baidyanathpur and Kendra villages.        
	An FIR was lodged today against four persons  one of them the Kendra panchayat chief, Bhagabat Ruidas.        
	We have come to know that the money under the rural job scheme was withdrawn showing bogus work between April and July. CPM panchayat functionaries had made false entries of work in the cards of around 200 villagers that they had kept with them, said an official.

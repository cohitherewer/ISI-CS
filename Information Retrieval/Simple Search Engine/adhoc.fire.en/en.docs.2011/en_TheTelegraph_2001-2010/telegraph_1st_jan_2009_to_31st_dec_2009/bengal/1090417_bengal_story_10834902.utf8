The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | BJP clears Gorkha air
                                                                                                               BJP clears Gorkha air
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                               
	Calcutta, April 16: The BJP central leadership today sent a national spokesperson here to clarify that the party had not made any commitment to fulfil the demand for Gorkhaland, but only to look into the matter sympathetically.        
	S.S. Ahluwalias visit came after state BJP leaders sent feelers to Delhi saying they had become untouchable in almost all districts barring Darjeeling for trying to partition Bengal again.        
	There was some confusion over what we have said in our manifesto and what is circulating in the hills.... The party has not committed to create Gorkhaland. We shall sympathetically examine the demand, Ahluwalia said.

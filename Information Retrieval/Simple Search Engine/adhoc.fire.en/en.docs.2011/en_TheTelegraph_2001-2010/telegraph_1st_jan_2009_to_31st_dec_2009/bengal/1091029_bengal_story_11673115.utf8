                                                                                                               Security ball in   rail court
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                    
	Calcutta, Oct. 28: The Bengal government will request the railway ministry to sanitise tracks, increase security personnel in coaches and run pilot engines ahead of key trains in Maoist-hit stretches.        
	A meeting convened by state chief secretary Asok Mohan Chakrabarti to review railway security after yesterdays siege of the Bhubaneswar Rajdhani decided on the suggestions.         
	It also discussed measures to ensure smooth running of trains through the Maoist-affected stretch between Kharagpur and Jamshedpur. Banstala, where the Rajdhani was held up, is on this section.        
	Home secretary Ardhendu Sen said after the meeting that measures should be taken to tighten security on the section. We have found that 30 to 35 trains pass through this stretch every day, of which five or six are important, like the Bhubaneswar Rajdhani, Purushottam Express and the Neelachal Express.        
	Additional director-general of police (railways) Dilip Mitra listed the suggestions to be sent to the railway ministry. They included sanitisation of tracks, especially before the arrival of key trains at Kharagpur or Chandil (in Jharkhand), increasing armed escorts in trains and exploring the possibility of running pilot engines.        
	We are trying to suggest measures like the ones adopted in Assam, Jharkhand and Chhattisgarh to run trains. Most of the trains passing through this stretch (in Bengal) are headed for Mumbai and Delhi, Mitra said.         
	The general managers of Eastern and South Eastern railway held a separate meeting with senior railway police officers. We discussed how the security system on trains and at stations can be overhauled, an officer who attended the meeting said.

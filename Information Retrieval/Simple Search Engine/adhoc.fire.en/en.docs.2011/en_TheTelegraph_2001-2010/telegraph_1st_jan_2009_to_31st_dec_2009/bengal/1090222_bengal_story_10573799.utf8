The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Toddler in park slips into drain and dies
                                                                                                               Toddler in park slips into drain and dies
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Calcutta, Feb. 21: A 10-month-old baby fell into a partially covered drain in a Garden Reach park after his seven-year-old sister put him down to drink water from a nearby tap.         
	The boys body was found after two hours, stuck under a concrete slab.        
	Arman had gone to the CMC Park around 9 this morning with his sister Neha.        
	Their father, Mohammad Lukman, who runs a laundry, said: She carried him in her arms and left home around 9. After an hour, she came running to me and said Arman was nowhere to be seen.         
	Neha, a student of Class I, later said: I found it difficult carrying him. I was also thirsty. So, I left him beside the drain and went to the nearby roadside tap to drink water. When I came back, he was not there.         
	Police said Arman had probably crawled a few feet and fallen into the drain through a gap between two concrete slabs.         
	We took two hours to recover the body because the boy was swept a few feet away. His body had got stuck under a concrete slab, said an officer of Garden Reach police station.        
	Residents held the CMC responsible for the death. Children come to the park every day to play. The drain inside the park should be comple- tely covered with concrete slabs. But there are uncov-ered portions and the boy slipped through one of these gaps, said resident Firoz Khan.        
	Lukman said if any of the other children (playing in the park) had noticed his son crawling towards the drain, he would have been alive now.        
	Abdul Khaleq Mollah, the Congress MLA from Garden Reach, said lapses on the CMCs part were responsible for Armans death.         
	The entire surface of the drain passing through the childrens park should have been covered completely. But there are more than a dozen wide gaps, he said.

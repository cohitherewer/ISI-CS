The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Guard clue to missing constables
                                                                                                               Guard clue to missing constables
          OUR BUREAU                              
	Oct. 26: State police chief Bhupinder Singh today said the arrested bodyguard of Peoples Committee Against Police Atrocities leader Chhatradhar Mahato had revealed a month ago that the two constables abducted from Lalgarh in July were still alive.        
	We are making all-out efforts to find them. We are in touch with their families, Singh said, adding that the police did not know in what state they are now.         
	Chhatradhar has apparently denied any knowledge about the whereabouts of Sabir Mollah and Kanchan Garai. (But) his bodyguard Papan Mondal had told us almost a month ago that they were alive then, Singh said.        
	Briefing the Left Front partners today, chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee too said that the government was not aware of the fate of the constables. He told them even Union home minister P. Chidambaram was clueless about whether they were alive.         
	Front chairman Biman Bose said the state government had been asked to intensify its search.        
	The initiative appears to have followed Mamata Banerjees efforts to derive political mileage out of the grievances of low-rung police personnel over the governments alleged inaction.         
	Mamata said she would meet the home minister in Delhi tomorrow with documents to prove a nexus bet-ween the CPM and the Maoists. I will hand over the documents on the CPM-Maoist gopon antant (secret entente) to Chidambaramji, the railway minister said before leaving for Delhi.        
	She claimed she could also prove that the Maoists killing of policemen and abduction of an officer at Sankrail last week were stage-managed by the government.         
	The CPM had accused Mamata of having Maoist links after she repeatedly opposed the governments offensive against the guerrillas in Lalgarh.        
	At the meeting with the home minister, Mamata will be accompanied by the relatives of the two missing constables. The state has done nothing for them. They will seek justice from Chidambaramji, she added.         
	At the front meeting, the chief minister regretted having said in Delhi that the two constables had been killed. Bose said it was an inadvertent mistake and the chief minister had corrected himself.         
	The constables had been kidnapped from an area about 10km from Lalgarh town on July 30. According to Singh, the Peoples Committee and the Maoists are synonymous. Kishanji may not have claimed responsibility for the kidnapping (of Sabir and Kanchan) but his outfit was the ones behind it.

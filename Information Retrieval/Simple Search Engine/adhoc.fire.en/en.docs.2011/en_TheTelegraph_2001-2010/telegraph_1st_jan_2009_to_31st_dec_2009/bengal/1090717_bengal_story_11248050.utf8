The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | What caused the CPM flare-up
                                                                                                               What caused the CPM flare-up
                                          
	The trail of political clashes that led to the Mangalkot flare-up on Wednesday                
	 How did the Burdwan clashes start?        
	On June 15, Falguni Mukherjee, a CPM district committee member in Mangalkot, was killed, allegedly by Trinamul Congress activists.         
	In retaliation, CPM supporters burnt 150 houses in the area, including some in the village of Dhanyarukhi where Falguni Mukherjee stayed.         
	The houses the CPM supporters allegedly set ablaze belonged to Trinamul and Congress supporters. Since the CPM retaliation, Trinamul and Congress leaders have been trying to visit the area.               
	 Is it a tussle for turf control between Trinamul and CPM?         
	It is a turf battle between the CPM and the Trinamul-Congress Opposition combine. The tussle started after the Opposition snatched the Bhalogram panchayat from the CPM in the rural polls in May 2008.         
	The Opposition alliance also got a shot in the arm after the good showing in the Lok Sabha elections, though the CPM fared better in the Mangalkot Assembly segment.               
	 How strong is the Congress in Mangalkot?        
	The Congress has for long had a presence in Katwa sub-division, under which Mangalkot falls. The party, which holds the Katwa seat, has won the Assembly constituency thrice consecutively. The Congress and Trinamul together won the Bhalogram panchayat, under which Dhanyarukhi falls.              
	 Why are CPM activists not allowing Opposition leaders to enter the area?        
	CPM sources said the Mangalkot was a tit-for-tat of sorts for the Khejuri violence. Trinamul had refused to let CPM leaders and ministers enter Khejuri in East Midnapore after the Opposition party recaptured the area and ransacked CPM offices.              
	 Did police inaction lead to the current flare-up?        
	Police inaction had a big part to play. Yesterday was not the first time Opposition leaders faced hostile CPM supporters in the area. Trinamul leaders Partha Chatterjee, Sudip Bandopadhyay and Madan Mitra were stopped by CPM supporters on their way to Mangalkot last month. The police did nothing to clear the way then. The Congress MLA team that was chased through paddy fields yesterday also alleged that the cops did nothing to stop the armed CPM mob.              
	 Who was leading the mob?        
	According to the Congress sources, two aides of Falguni Mukherjee  Sushil Pal and Keshab Ghosh  led the attack. But there is no confirmation from the police on this.        
	Some local CPM leaders alleged that two of the alleged killers of Falguni Mukherjee were with the visiting Congress team yesterday. But the police have denied this.              
	 What have the police done so far?         
	They arrested eight CPM supporters yesterday but Pal and Ghosh were not among them.              
	 What action has the CPM taken?        
	The CPM district leadership has denied that its supporters chased the Congress MLAs. It said if action against anyone has to be taken, it is up to the police to do so.               
	 The Katwa Assembly seat is held by the Congress. How did the CPM manage to organise a mob chase which the Congress could not counter?        
	Dhanyarukhi is in the Mangalkot Assembly constituency which the CPM holds. Although the gram panchayat under which Dhanyarukhi falls is now in Congress-Trinamul control, the CPM has a considerable presence in the village.         
	The CPM supporters were enraged at the murder of Falguni Mukherjee, who hails from the same village. Also, the Congress supporters were not expecting an attack of this kind.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Maoist trial for Trinamul leaders
                                                                                                               Maoist trial for Trinamul leaders
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Midnapore, Sept. 4: Maoists tied two Trinamul Congress leaders to a tree and thrashed them for corruption, a charge the guerrillas had so far levelled only at CPM leaders.        
	Tarun Mondal and Ranjit Shau were tried in a kanga-roo court, beaten up and made to sign declarations saying they were quitting the corrupt Trinamul. The two have fled their village.        
	Tarun, the party general secretary in Belpaharis Binpur II block, and Ranjit, secre-tary of Banspahari panchayats village development committee, were accused of misappropriating funds from welfare schemes like the Indira Awas Yojana. The committee identifies projects to be taken up for village development.        
	Trinamul is almost a fringe player in the region but runs the Banspahari gram panchayat with support from the Jharkhand Partys Naren Hansda and Aditya Kisku factions, which control most of the nine other rural bodies in the Belpahari police station area.        
	Tarun and Ranjit were cycling to a party programme when around 20 armed guerrillas waylaid them on Wednesday and took them into the jungles. Around 30 villagers were also herded to the peoples court. They tied the two to a sal tree and held the bichar sabha, said a villager.        
	Tarun and Ranjit were held guilty and made to sign leaflets saying they were severing all links with Trinamul before being thrashed. The Maoists beat them with rifle butts and sticks before letting them go, the villager said.        
	The two got 1,000 copies of the signed leaflets printed in Belpahari town and distribu- ted them yesterday in the local bazaar. Some of the leaflets were pasted on trees and walls. They said: We are severing all links with the corrupt and anti-people Trinamul Congress.         
	The leaders fled after circulating the papers.        
	West Midnapore Trinamul president Mrigen Maity said: Both have left the party following threats. But we dont know who threatened them.

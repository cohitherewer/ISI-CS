                                                                                                               Cong link makes mom happier
          BARUN GHOSH                          Mamatas sisters-in-law and nephew with her mother on Friday. (Pabitra Das)                                  
	Calcutta, May 22: Gayatri Devi felt this strange emotion watching her daughter say I, Mamata Banerjee, swear in the name of God.        
	I felt so different and so much happier this evening when she was taking the oath. And do you know why? the 76-year-old asked in obvious pride minutes after Mamata had been sworn in. Then, as a smile lit up her face, she opened up: Because this time she is with the Congress.        
	Gayatri said she risked her daugh- ters displeasure by saying this, but couldnt help doing so since ours is a Congress family.        
	Sitting in her single-room home on Harish Chatterjee Street, Gayatri recalled that her husband (Promileswar) was a Congress activist and always voted the party. When I watched her taking the oath last time (1999), there was pride but it was tinged with discomfort as she was with the BJP. Now I am truly happy she is going to be the railway minister in a Congress-led government.         
	Mamata called her up at 2.30pm. She told me Ma, Im becoming a mantri Give me your aashirbad, Gayatri said.         
	The 14-inch TV was switched on long before the proceedings began at Rashtrapati Bhavan. Neighbours had dropped in and joined Gayatri, her three sons, their wives and grandchildren. A deafening applause rent the air in the packed 10ftX12ft room as Mamata finished. Sweet packets were passed around.         
	I couldnt believe that my daughter, who had cried on my shoulders in 2004 when she was the only Trinamul winner, has now gone to Delhi with 19 MPs, Gayatri said.

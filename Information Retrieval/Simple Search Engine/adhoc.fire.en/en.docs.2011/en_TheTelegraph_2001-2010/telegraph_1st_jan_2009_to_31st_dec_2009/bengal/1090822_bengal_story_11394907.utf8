          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Mamata Banerjee at the meeting with industry captains on Friday. Pictures by Amit Datta                                        
	Calcutta, Aug. 21: Culture yesterday, industry today. It is early to write tomorrows story, but it is possible that some elements will match.         
	Mamata Banerjees face- offs with big names in Bengals culture and industry on two successive days have an obvious political message: she is imitating the ways of her enemy, Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee.         
	But this imitation is no flattery; it is a calculated political move to strip the chief minister of the two constituencies that have identified his public image: culture and industry. He claimed the first as a natural one; the second was clearly an acquired one.         
	Mamata has been trying hard to acquire both. No pretender to culture until recently despite authoring several books of fiction and poetry, she has learnt the importance of associations with culture in Bengals politics.         
	Her day with some well-known names in Bengali litera- ture and the arts yesterday at the Science City auditorium was actually a celebration of her gains in the field of culture in the course of her Singur-Nandigram movement.         
	She has not stopped at just getting the support of the intellectuals; she is trying to acquire the image of one. Remember her ready, prolific quotes from Tagore, Nazrul Islam, et al in her interviews on television before the elections.         
	The message: she can match Bhattacharjees love of Tagore  almost poem by poem.         
	In industry, though, she has to work a little harder. The victory she claimed even before the polls was over dri-ving out Tata Motors small-car project from Bengal. Her victory may have prepared the stage for the CPMs subsequent defeat, but it was a nightmare scenario for industry captains and potential investors in Bengal.         
	It is time now for her to prove, as he she did with culture, that she can do what Bhattacharjee can or, better still, she can do what he could not. She has said this before; she had met leaders of commerce and industry even before the elections. But her interactions with industrialists have an altogether different dimension  shes more than a shadow chief minister, she has a real chance of becoming the real one in 2011. Such is her anxiety to shed the anti-industry image that she is taking pains to present a total makeover so long in advance.         
	The makeover move has already got a realistic push with Mamata having men like Amit Mitra of Ficci and economist Bibek Debroy as her advisers. Apart from todays meeting with trade and industry representatives, she has plans to meet many of them individually. Mitras expertise would be crucial in building a bridge of trust between her and the industrialists.        
	It is no coincidence that at her meeting with businessmen today, and even on other occasions recently, she harped on the railway ministry already setting up a land bank of over 1.3 lakh acres in Bengal. One of the more persistent scepticisms that she faces is over land for industry. She not only opposed the Bhattacharjee governments takeover of farmland for the Tata factory in Singur but also threatened to foil such attempts anywhere else.         
	On the land question, she cannot afford to say she would do what Bhattacharjee did. But she might be forced to follow the same path sooner or later  and face the same kind of problems that she forced the chief minister to face.         
	What then? The answer will depend partly on what she does in such a situation and also what the CPM does once the roles are reversed. Will the CPM in the opposition choose to pay her back in her own tit-for-tat politics? The party will have no logic for doing so, but then logic does not drive politics, particularly in Bengal. Also, a demoralised and desperate party cadre may not listen to counsel by discredited leaders.         
	There is absolutely no question that Mamata will have to take land for industry and face problems. The question is: can she step into Bhattacharjees shoes and not stumble like him?

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | An army in wait for missing vehicles
                                                                                                               An army in wait for missing vehicles
          A STAFF REPORTER       
	Calcutta, Aug. 1: Two autos, three taxis, five trucks and a bus  the seizure list on Day I have left the cops from Calcutta and its adjoining districts wondering how long they would have to continue with the cat-and-mouse game.         
	If the number of banned vehicles on the road is less, the whole process will drag. After todays outcome we are not sure how long we will have to continue. I think we will have to rework the scale of deployment as the force has other commitments as well, said a senior officer.        
	Over 1,700 city police personnel were deployed for the crackdown today.        
	Teams of 100 cops each had been deployed at at five vital points across the city  Rashbehari, Mahatma Gandhi Road-CR Avenue crossing, Park Circus, Khanna crossing, Shyambazar and Kidderpore. The teams included members of the Rapid Action Force.         
	It was a detailed arrangement with a lathi-wielding force, personnel armed with tear-gas shells and members of a special unit led by armed officers, said joint commissioner of police Jawed Shamim. Every city police station had been asked to be prepared with their full strength.        
	But for how long, the police were asking.        
	It is difficult not only to maintain the same heavy deployment but also the same alertness if the mission drags on, an officer said.        
	Unlike in the city, the number of policemen on the road was conspicuously less on the fringes. From Behala and Ga-ria in the south to Titagarh in North 24-Parganas, two-stroke autos were still ruling the roads.         
	The number of traffic personnel is very poor anyway in the districts and the cops at the police stations are stretched because of law-and-order problems and crimes, said a senior North 24-Parganas officer. We couldnt provide forces to the regional transport authority in Barrackpore and Barasat.        
	Protests following a murder bid on two Trinamul Congress supporters turned violent in the district today and the police had to resort to tear-gas shelling.        
	In Howrah and South 24-Parganas, too, the forces struggled to launch the crackdown and prayed for matters to draw to an end soon.         
	At Kudghat, south of Tollygunge, few policemen were in sight when a gang of 20-25 damaged buses this morning.

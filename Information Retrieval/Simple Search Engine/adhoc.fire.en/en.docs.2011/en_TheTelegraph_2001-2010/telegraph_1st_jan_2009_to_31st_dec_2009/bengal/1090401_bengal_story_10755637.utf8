The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Semester amp; grades in every college
                                                                                                               Semester amp; grades in every college

	Calcutta, March 31: Annual exams could be a thing of the past in colleges across Bengal as early as next year.        
	Universities offering undergraduate courses are getting ready to replace the Part I, Part II and Part III exams held after every year of the three-year undergraduate courses with semesters.         
	That is not the only change in the works. Grades could replace marks and it might be- come possible to study a part of the three-year course at a different institution, which may not even be in India.        
	The move follows a letter from the University Grants Commission (UGC) to universities across the country early this month, asking them to implement the reforms within the Eleventh Plan period, which ends in 2012. Sources said the UGC wanted the changes preferably by next year.        
	The process of implementing the reforms has started in all universities. Workshops and seminars are being held, involving teachers bodies. A final decision on when the changes can be implemented will be taken on the basis of teachers suggestions, said Dipak Bhattacharya, member secretary of the West Bengal Co-uncil of Higher Education.        
	The letter from UGC chairperson Sukhdeo Thorat links the implementation of the changes with the grants.         
	After receiving the missive, the Bengal government has asked all its universities to ensure that they are able to undertake the reforms within the deadline.        
	The traditional model has limitations, while the semester system encourages faster learning opportunities, says Thorats letter to central, state and deemed universities.        
	Kalyani University and North Bengal University have completed the discussions with teachers and said they were ready to introduce semesters, grades and the credit-transfer curriculum.         
	The credit-transfer curriculum allows a student to study a part of the course under a different university. Grades or marks attained there will be transferred to the original university in the final results.        
	Calcutta University, Bur-dwan University, Vidyasagar University in Midnapore and the new West Bengal State University in Barasat are in the process of implementing the reforms.        
	Calcutta, which has nearly 200 affiliated colleges, might take some time to switch to the semester mode, a source in the university said. We need to update and revise our academic programmes at the undergraduate level.         
	The university now conducts undergraduate exams once a year. Many more examiners are needed to conduct the semester exams, to be held twice a year, the official said.

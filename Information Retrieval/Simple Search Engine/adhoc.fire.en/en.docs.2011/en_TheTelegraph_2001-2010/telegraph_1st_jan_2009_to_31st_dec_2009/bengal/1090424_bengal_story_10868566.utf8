	Calcutta, April 23: At least 25 persons, including a CPM leader, were injured when Trinamul Congress supporters clashed with those of the ruling party near Satengabari in Nandigram for demolishing a dais they were constructing for an election meeting.         
	Police said the CPM men had allegedly demolished the dais at Takapura, about 165km from Calcutta, which Trinamul workers were constructing for the meeting in support of the partys Tamluk nominee, Subhendu Adhikari. Those injured include CPMs Takapura local committee secretary Alokesh Das.         
	When police intervened, they were pelted with stones. Five of the policemen were injured. The mob also damaged a police jeep.        
	Police sources said the force fired two rounds in the air when a lathicharge failed to disperse the mob.         
	East Midnapore police chief Pallab Kanti Ghosh, however, denied the report of firing.

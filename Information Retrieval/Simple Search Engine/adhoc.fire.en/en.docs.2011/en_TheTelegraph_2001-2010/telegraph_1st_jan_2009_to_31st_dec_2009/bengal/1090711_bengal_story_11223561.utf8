	Behrampore, July 10: Two villagers were killed in police firing while another was hacked to death during a clash between two groups of people in the Naoda area of Murshidabad this afternoon.        
	At Trimohini village, about 220km from Calcutta, five shops were looted and set on fire by the mobs.        
	A police officer said seven cops, including a deputy superintendent, were injured by stones hurled at them.         
	Home secretary Ardhendu Sen said some outsiders had entered a high school at Jhaubona village and attacked students. The incident snowballed into a clash at the bazaar in neighbouring Trimohini.         
	The police tried to disperse the warring groups. But when they failed to do so, they opened fire in which two villagers were killed, Sen said.         
	The situation is under control and the district magistrate has been asked to hold a peace meeting in the village tomorrow.

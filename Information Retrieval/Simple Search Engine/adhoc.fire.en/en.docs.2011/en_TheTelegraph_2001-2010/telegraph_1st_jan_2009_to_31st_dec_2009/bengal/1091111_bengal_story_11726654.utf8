	Asansol, Nov. 10: Citu workers today roughed up executives of an RPG Group mine that supplies coal to CESC and ransacked its office in Asansols Barabani to protest voucher payment of wage increments.     
	The workers sat on a dharna at the mines gate and stopped coal production for eight hours from 6am. Work resumed past 2pm after police intervened. But the union threatened to restart the agitation a week later if its demand was not met. The mine supplies coal to CESCs Budge Budge and Titagarh power plants. If the mine is shut for a long period, power supply is likely to be affected in Calcutta.        
	Tamluk: Around 1,000 Trinamul supporters marched to the CPMs East Midnapore headquarters here on Tuesday and stoned it to protest an attack on their MP Subh- endu Adhikari in Haldia on Monday. CPM leaders ran into the building and locked themselves in when the attack began. Its windows were smashed. Police chased the attackers away.

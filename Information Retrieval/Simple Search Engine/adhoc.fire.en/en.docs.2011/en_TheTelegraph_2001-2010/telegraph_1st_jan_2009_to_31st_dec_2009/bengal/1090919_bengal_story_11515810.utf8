The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Village funds puja with rice
                                                                                                               Village funds puja with rice
          SOUMI BHATTACHARYA                          Two children in Sehala village work on the idol                                  
	Sehala (Birbhum), Sept. 18: The people of Sehala dont collect subscription money for the Durga puja in their village.         
	They collect rice.        
	The Birbhum village, with 55 households of paddy farmers and farm labourers, collects surplus rice from each home every week. The rice, sold in Bolpur town 10km away, gets them their puja fund.         
	Sehala has been organising Durga Puja for 14 years in this way.         
	We decided to organise a Durga puja in our village 14 years ago. But we knew we could not afford a big-budget puja as we are mostly small farmers or labourers. So, a villager, Nirmal Pal, suggested that we keep aside a small quantity of rice according to our means everyday and then sell it to raise funds for the puja, said Niranjan Pal, a farmer.         
	Niranjan, who is one of the puja committee members, said this year the village sold 142kg of rice and got Rs 2,000.        
	But they were short on funds. But their foresight rescued them.        
	Years back, the villagers had bought cheap land nearby with the money they had saved from the puja costs. This year, rice grown on that plot was sold for Rs 3,000.        
	We have a small budget and we manage with the money. We spend only about Rs 500 on the idol. The clay comes from our land. We only buy the stuff needed for decorations. Bipin Pal, who stays in our village, makes the idol for free, said Bijuli Pal, 48, a housewife.        
	Joydeb Pal, another farmer, said initially it was planned that the rice would be collected throughout the year and then sold.         
	But part of the grain went bad. So we decided to sell the rice every week. Schoolboys go round the village collecting the rice from the 55 families and then take them to a shop in Bolpur town where it is sold, said Joydeb.         
	Some of the bigger pujas in Birbhum know about the puja in Sehala.         
	We appreciate the efforts of the Sehala villagers. But our puja is dependent on subscriptions from residents and businessmen because people of Suri expect to see lights and decorations at the pandal. We have arranged for special illuminations this year and we will distribute clothes to the poor, said Prasenjit Das, secretary of the Jonaki Club puja committee in Suri town.

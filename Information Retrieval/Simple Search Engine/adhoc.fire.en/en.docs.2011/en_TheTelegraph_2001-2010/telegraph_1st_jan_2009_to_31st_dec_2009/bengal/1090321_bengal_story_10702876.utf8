                                                                                                               Citu says sorry for assault
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Durgapur, March 20: Citu supporters on strike for four days at Durgapur Steel Plant today apologised to the management for assaulting executives last week and called off their agitation.        
	Weve apologised for our behaviour in the presence of the labour minister and promised to maintain normality at the plant, said P.K. Das, Burdwan district committee member of the CPMs labour arm.        
	Workers employed by contractors had thrashed five senior plant officials during a demonstration over recruitment of labourers on March 13.        
	Around 5,000 Citu-affiliated workers went on strike three days later to protest the authorities decision to bar their general secretary from entering the plant.         
	After the strike was called off, DSP withdrew the bar on Laltu Senguptas entry and the suspension of two employees accused of instigating the mob on March 13.        
	The matter was sorted out at a marathon tripartite meeting chaired by labour minister Mrinal Banerjee that continued till 2am today.

  - Four men killed inside UBI, manager survives stabs        OUR CORRESPONDENT                                                  
	Karimpur (Nadia), Nov. 13: Officials let in known faces at a United Bank of India branch here last night only to be butchered in cold blood by the gang, apparently after a failed bid to access the vault.        
	Five men had their throats slit in a washroom but one of them, a deputy manager who was left for dead, survived.        
	At Apollo Gleneagles Hospital in Calcutta, doctors said Amit Mullick was out of danger but had been advised not to speak.        
	Mullick, who was working late into the night with two of-ficers and two casual employees, alerted a colleague over the phone about the massacre once he regained consciousness around a quarter to 11.         
	Amit Saha, who works as an agent for the bank, said Mullick told him on the way to hospital that one or two of the attackers were known faces.        
	Police said a group of seven had turned up at the bank around 10 last night.         
	According to the purported account provided by the deputy manager, the seven whipped out revolvers and knives and asked for keys to the vault. The manager gave them the key he had but a second key, which was with the head cashier who had left early, was also required to access the vault, Saha said.        
	After the failed attempt to open the vault, the five were dragged to the washroom.        
	When the cops came aro- und 11pm, Madhusudan Karmakar, 58, Prabir Mukherjee, 52, Kajal Chakraborty, 44, and Arunava Mondal, 40, were dead. Chakraborty used to do sundry chores while Mondal operated the generator.        
	The murders were possibly necessitated by the fact that the goons had been identified. We suspect that there were known faces among them and they did not want to leave witnesses, said Murshidabad range deputy inspector-general R.K. Adhikary.         
	The possible hand of Bangladeshi criminals and Maoists is also being probed. The Bangladesh border is only 6km from Karimpur town. There is also a known Maoist presence here, an officer said.        
	Cashier Diptendranath Chowdhury, whom Mullick had called, said: I informed the police and other employees and rushed.        
	He added that when officers worked late into the night, the banks door was locked. The lock had not been broken open last night.        
	The police brought in a sniffer dog this afternoon to the bank, on the first-floor of a two-storey building with shops on the ground floor.        
	The United Bank Officers Association blamed manpower crunch and workload for officers regularly having to work late into the night.        
	The UBI regional manager in Krishnagar, P.K. Moitra, admitted that the banks security arrangements (a lone guard with a gun) are withdrawn after customer service hours.        
	The police have sealed off the Karimpur branch. Nadia police chief Champak Bhattacharya said it would remain sealed until forensic and fingerprint experts completed collecting samples.        
	A bank official pointed out another problem for the reopening. Employees will have to be brought from other branches. It would be impossible to work without three officers.        
	In Calcutta, Mullicks wife Papiya was too traumatised to speak.         
	The hospital said he was stabbed in the neck as well as strangulated but none of the injuries was deep. The vocal cord has not suffered injury and he does not need surgery. But he has been advised not to speak, said hospital medical director Arijit Bose.

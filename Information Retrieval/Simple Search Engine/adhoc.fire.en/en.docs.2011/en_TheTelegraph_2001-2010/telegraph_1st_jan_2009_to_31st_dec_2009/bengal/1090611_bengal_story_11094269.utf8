          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Haldia, June 10: The post-poll atmosphere in Bengal is such that even the chief secretary thinks it is better to scamper up the stairs than risk a Trinamul Congress backlash.        
	When Asok Mohan Chakrabarti reached the Haldia Development Authority (HDA) office today, he sprinted up the stairs with Trinamul supporters at his heels shouting: Notun chairmanke manchhi na manbo na (We dont accept the new chairman).        
	Chakrabarti, who was appointed the new chairman of the HDA yesterday, succeeded Lakshman Seth, the former Tamluk MP seen to be behind the governments failed land campaign in Nandigram.        
	About 1,000 Trinamul and Congress workers were waiting when Chakrabarti arrived to take charge. We dont want a bureaucrat to head the HDA. Instead, the present Trinamul MP from Tamluk, Subhendu Adhikari, should be appointed, the protes- ters yelled as Chakrabarti entered the gate around 11.30.        
	The agitators surged towards him as he got out of his car, but police pushed them back. Some of the policemen then put up a barricade, others escorted Chakrabarti to his second-floor office.        
	As he was climbing the stairs, some demonstrators rushed towards him, this time breaking the police barricade. Chakrabarti scampered two steps at a time to avoid the chase party.         
	The police had a tough time controlling the Trinamul and Congress workers as a few of them had already started sprinting up the stairs to catch up with Chakrabarti.         
	Justifying todays demonstration, Ananda Adhikari, a Trinamul leader, said: Chakrabarti, who cannot run the state administration, is a misfit for the post of HDA chairman.         
	Asked about the demonstration, Chakrabarti said that he had nothing to say.

	Midnapore, Dec. 17: A police team that had gone to the house of a Trinamul Congress activist in Midnapore after reports of his abduction claimed to have found 250 live bullets, raising the suspicion of a Maoist link.         
	We are probing whether he was involved in supplying ammo to the Maoists, said Manoj Verma, the West Midnapore police chief.        
	Shyamal Acharyas family in Keshpur, West Midnapore, said he fled the area eight years ago after threats from the CPM. Some local Trinamul Congress leaders told us last night that my brother was kidnapped on Monday. They said Shyamal had been kidnapped by some people from a Midnapore bus stand, said Goutam, Shyamals brother.        
	District Trinamul leader Gunadhar Pan said: We suspect CPM cadres abducted Shyamal, murdered him and hid his body. He denied knowledge about the cartridges.

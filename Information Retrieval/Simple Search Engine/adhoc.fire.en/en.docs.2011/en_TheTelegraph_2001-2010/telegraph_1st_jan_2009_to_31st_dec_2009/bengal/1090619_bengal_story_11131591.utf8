The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | The red earth   Choppers on standby to ferry injured
                                                                                                               The red earth     Choppers on standby to ferry injured
          A STAFF REPORTER                                                
	Calcutta, June 18: Indian Air Force helicopters will be deployed for the police march towards Lalgarh for casualty evacuation, officials said today.         
	We will be using the chopper to carry the injured, if any, of both sides to hospital, said chief secretary Asok Mohan Chakrabarti, who announced that one helicopter would be deployed from tomorrow.        
	The IAF is keeping three helicopters on standby at its Kalaikunda base in West Midnapore  Lalgarh is part of the district  for casualty evacuation on the governments request, other officials said in Delhi. In reply to a question, Chakrabarti said: Men will not be air dropped as thats a very dangerous proposition in that area.         
	However, IAF sources said the term casualty evacuation covers transport of any personnel. The helicopter will also airdrop leaflets on the route to Lalgarh urging residents not to allow themselves to be used as human shields.        
	An armed terror group that calls itself Maoist is using people of the forest area as pawns to fight its own grudge battles, the leaflet says.        
	Please dont let them use children and women as a shield while they rampantly kill and torture people. Discuss whatever problems ail your area with the state government. A lot can be solved through discussions. Please return to your homes and help the authorities restore peace in the area, it adds.         
	The leaflets, printed in Hindi and Bengali on either side, will be dropped before police reach an area. The marching forces will also carry the leaflets with them.        
	The state government seemed satisfied with the progress of the march on the first day. The forces started moving this morning and marched past Pirakata towards Lalgarh. They did face obstruction at one point, which was forcefully removed. Tear gas shells were fired and there was a lathicharge, home secretary Ardhendu Sen said this evening.         
	In reply to a question, Sen said no rubber bullets were fired and that there were no serious injuries. Some arrests have possibly been made. But I dont have the details, he said at Writers Buildings.        
	The home secretary conceded the government had expected stiffer resistance and said the forces would continue to tread cautiously and slowly.         
	We did not face trademark Maoist offensives on the first day. There were no shots fired at our forces either. But we have to be very cautious as we progress. It is a forest area and we can expect an attack or ambush at virtually every step, Sen said.        
	The government did not say how long it expected the forces to take to get control of the area. It is a war situation out there. We cannot give any critical information, Sen said. Chief secretary Chakrabarti said innocent people may have got hurt today. It is possible that some innocent people received a few blows but this sort of thing can happen in an operation like this. There are, however, no reports of serious injuries.        
	Earlier in the day, Chakrabarti had said the government was open to talks with the Maoists. But Sen added a rider: We are open to discussions but not at this stage with such a lot of violence being carried out (by the Maoists). Also, all the unauthorised weapons have to be flushed out from the area. That is our priority now.

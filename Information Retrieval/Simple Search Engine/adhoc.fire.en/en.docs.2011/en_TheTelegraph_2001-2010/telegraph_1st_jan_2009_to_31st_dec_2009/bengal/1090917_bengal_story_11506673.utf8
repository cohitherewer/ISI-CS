                                                                                                               Acid burns girl who spurned suitor 
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Chinsurah, Sept. 16: A first- year college girl was injured last night in an acid attack by a youth in Hooghlys Pandua.        
	Police said 18-year-old Rinku Mondal, was returning home when Sukho Karmakar hurled the acid at her.        
	Rinku, the daughter of a tea seller, used to teach children. She was returning home after the tuitions when she was assaulted.        
	The police suspect labourer Biswanath Karmakar, a married youth from Pandua, to be behind this. Our investigation has revealed that Rinku was continuously teased and disturbed by Biswanath, a married man and a labourer, for the past one month. He had become angry when the girl repeatedly refused his advances. Biswanath is absconding and we are looking for him, said Deborshi Sinha, officer-in-charge of Pandua police station.        
	Sinha said Biswanath had engaged Sukho, who is jobless, to assault Rinku. We have arrested Sukho on the basis of a statement given by Rinku from her hospital bed.         
	Sukho was produced in court today and was remanded in two weeks jail custody.        
	Rinku, a BA student of the Itachuna College in Pandua, was admitted to Chinsurah Imambara Hospital with severe burns on the left side of her face.         
	Biswanath used to tease me on the road whenever he saw me. He also wrote obscenities on pieces of paper and threw them in our courtyard. I told him several times to leave me alone. Yesterday, when I was returning from a students house, I saw Biswanath and Sukho standing on the road in the headlights of a passing car  there was a power cut in the area. Suddenly, Sukho hurled the acid at my face, said Rinku.        
	Rinkus father, Rupkumar Mondal said his daughter had told him a fortnight ago that Biswanath was teasing her and passing lewd comments. But I did not take my daughters words seriously. I thought that a local youth would not mess with my daughter. But now I regret my decision, said Rupkumar.

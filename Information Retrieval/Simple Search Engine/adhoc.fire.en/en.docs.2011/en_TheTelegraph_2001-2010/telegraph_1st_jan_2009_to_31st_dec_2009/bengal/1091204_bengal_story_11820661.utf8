          OUR CORRESPONDENT                               
	Darjeeling, Dec. 3: Gorkha Janmukti Morcha president Bimal Gurung today said a congenial atmosphere with no law-and-order problem would prevail till the fourth round of tripartite talks here on December 21.         
	After a one-and-a-half-hour meeting with Vijay Madan, the Centre-appointed interlocutor for the talks, Gurung said: We have assured him that a congenial atmosphere will be maintained and there will be no law-and-order problem till the tripartite meeting. The talks are being held in Darjeeling and it is our duty to maintain such an atmosphere.         
	However, the ongoing agitation as part of which Morcha supporters do not pay power and phone bills and motor vehicles and land taxes is likely to continue. The Morcha ban on sale of licensed liquor will also stay.

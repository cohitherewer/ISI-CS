	Kadashole, June 26: Swarup Hansda, his wife and two sons were huddled inside their hut, clutching each other as they heard Maoist squad members run around barking orders around 7am.        
	From the conversation of the guerrillas they realised a police offensive was imminent. Around 11am, there were gunshots and they went deeper into the house.        
	Then, for several hours, Swarup, 41, his wife Sardari and two sons, Thakurdas, 14, and Sagar, 5, did not even dare to crack open a window to see what was going on outside.        
	Around quarter to three, Swarup heard the thump of marching boots outside and opened a window. The security forces had entered the village, almost deserted but for a few families like Swarups and the old and ailing.        
	Swarup was relieved. The tension of a fight waiting to break, which had gnawed them over the past few days, was gone all of a sudden. We saw the village streets filled with men in uniform and breathed easy. The battle we had so feared has not taken place.        
	When the first shots rang out, Swarup had thought a bloody battle would be fought in Kadashole. Now we feel relieved that the worst is over. We are poor landless labourers and want to live in peace, he said.        
	Unlike most other villagers, Swarup could not escape to the safety of a relatives house because he doesnt have any.        
	His wife fears that villagers who were forced by the Peoples Committee Against Police Atrocities to march in their processions and stand guard at night on the lookout for police, may be picked up and tortured by the forces.        
	Sardari was also relieved. I will start cooking now, she said. The chores had got stalled because of the tension in the air since late last night.         
	The rice she cooked was provided by the block office at Goaltore, 4km away, yesterday.        
	 Thakurdas, a Class VIII student in the high school at Kantapahari, hoped his school, closed for about a month, would reopen now.         
	Such is the mistrust for the security forces in this region, Kalidas Dandapat, 70, had thought the police would start caning the villagers on entry. I was surprised when they did not, he said, sitting on a bench outside their house with wife Leelabati.         
	Their three labourer sons, their wives and children have fled to a relatives house.        
	Kalidas has another worry now. What will happen after the police leave?        
	Jiban Hansda, 50, the lone member of his family guarding his house, echoed Kalidass concern. The Maoists will return again, he said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Police turn prisoners
                                                                                                               Police turn prisoners
          IMRAN AHMED SIDDIQUI                              
	Khejuri, June 14: Two hundred Khejuri policemen today complained they had been reduced to what law-breakers were after being convicted  prisoners.        
	We are living as prisoners. It is not clear how long this will go on, said an officer, referring to the Trinamul Congresss social boycott. The party has demanded the release of 14 activists held for allegedly torching CPM offices and ransacking homes last week.        
	The protest, borrowed from the way tribals had forced the police out in Salboni two months ago by snapping their supply lines, started spilling over to the cops food plates today.         
	No breakfast. Rice, dal and a potato-pumpkin curry for lunch and dinner. The menu is unlikely to change as the force has provisions for just that. It will last for three to four days.        
	The provisions brought today will run for three to four days. God knows what will happen after that, said a RAF jawan in one of the seven camps set up near the police station.        
	The 10 constables cooking in the police station, from where food is being ferried to the camps, havent had it easy.         
	Kerosene was poured into the tube well  the only source of water for the entire force  and it had to be cleaned for hours before water was available for cooking.        
	Drinking water became a problem, too. Our men have been ferrying drinking water from the police station tube well to the camps, said the RAF jawan.        
	Having a bath seemed a challenge. Around 50 Trinamul supporters prevented 20 RAF personnel from taking a dip in a pond near the police station. Patience appears to be running out. Its becoming intolerable. The government should decide the next course of action soon as resentment in the force is growing, another officer said. A constable wasnt allowed to take bus to Tamluk to see his ailing mother. We cant work like this, he added.        
	Subdivisional police officer Bhaskar Mukherjee expressed fears of a revolt in the force.         
	A senior officer said things might go like this till June 26, when the 14 Trinamul supporters held for arson are to be produced in court. We would have no option but to appeal to the court to grant them bail.

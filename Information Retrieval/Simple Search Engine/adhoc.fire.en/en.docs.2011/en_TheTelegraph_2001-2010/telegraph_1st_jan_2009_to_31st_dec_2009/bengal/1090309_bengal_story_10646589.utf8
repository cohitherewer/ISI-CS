          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Durgapur, March 8: A man whose addiction to online lottery had led to a debt of around Rs 60,000 killed himself in Durgapur town last night.        
	Police said Sheikh Nurul, 47, had borrowed the money from friends and neighbours over the past few months. He invested it in the lottery and lost everything. The lenders were after him, said an officer.         
	Nurul returned home from Durgapur Steel Plant, where he worked under a contractor, last night and went straight to his room. His wife found him hanging when she went with a cup of tea this morning. He came in late and refused dinner. I told him that some of his friends came in the evening and asked for the money. He didnt say anything and went to his room, said Aklima Bibi, who slept in another room with their four children.         
	Nurul usually slept with his two sons and the daughters with Aklima. Last night, he refused to sleep with his children. Aklima said: He had sold off our fridge and television. I tried to keep him away from online lottery but failed.

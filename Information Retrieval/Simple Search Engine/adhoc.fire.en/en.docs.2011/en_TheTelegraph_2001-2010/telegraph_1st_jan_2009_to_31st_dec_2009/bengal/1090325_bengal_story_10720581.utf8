The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Lalgarh resists poll police
                                                                                                               Lalgarh resists poll police
          OUR BUREAU                              
	March 24: Tribal leaders in West Midnapores Lalgarh today indicated they would not allow police to enter their territory for election duty, putting the government in a quandary.         
	After a meeting called by the chief minister at Writers Buildings, home secretary Ardhendu Sen said: All of us are aware that the Lok Sabha polls are near and police presence in Lalgarh is essential. Hundreds of poll personnel would be in Lalgarh and their safety and security is the governments concern. That is why we want the police to move into Lalgarh. However, we dont want any confrontation with the people.         
	The deployment will be entirely from the poll pers- pective, Sen said. The Election Commission has told us there should be adequate security in Lalgarh.        
	However, after a meeting with West Midnapore district magistrate Narayan Swarup Nigam and police chief Manoj Verma, the tribal leader of the Peoples Committee Ag- ainst Police Atrocities said the government would have to accept responsibility if the resistance to the police resulted in casualties.         
	We told the administra-tion wed inform them about our decision after talking to our leaders. But I am certain our decision will be to not allow the police to enter Lalgarh. The polls can be held without any police presence in Lalgarh. However, if the police forcibly enter the area, the people will resist. In that case, the government will be responsible for casualties, Chhatradhar Mahato said after the meeting at the Lalgarh subdivisional office.        
	The home secretary said the elections couldnt be fair with armed Maoists stalking the area. There is a need to flush out the Maoists operating in Lalgarh as they wont allow peaceful polls. Any sort of appeal to them also wont work, he added.        
	Therefore, Sen said, a tactical strategy would have to be worked out.         
	We are considering ways to ensure police presence in Lalgarh, though we cannot reveal what they are, Sen added.        
	Chief secretary Asok Mohan Chakrabarti insisted that this would have to be through discussions with the tri-bals as the government did not want any armed confrontation.         
	Theres no question of going into a confrontation with the innocent people of Lalgarh. Talks with the tribals will have to be taken forward. However, the state government will have to follow every poll panel directive on holding elections, be it police deployment or any other issue, Chakrabarti said.

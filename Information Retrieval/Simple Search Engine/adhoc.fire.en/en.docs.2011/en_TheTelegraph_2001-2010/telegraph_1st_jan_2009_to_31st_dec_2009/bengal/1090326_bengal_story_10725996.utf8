The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Court lifts farm block
                                                                                                               Court lifts farm block
  - Appeal against Keventers licence plea turned down        OUR BUREAU                                    
	Calcutta, March 25: A high court division bench today dismissed an appeal challenging the order asking a market committee to accept fees for the renewal of Keventer Freshs licence to sell farm produce.        
	A trial bench of the high court had issued the order following a petition by Keventer alleging that the Barasat Regulated Market Committee was not accepting the fees to renew the licence it had for wholesale business.        
	The court is upholding the order of the trial bench, Chief Justice S.S. Nijjar and Justice B. Somadder said.        
	Debanjan Mandal, partner of Keventers solicitors Fox amp; Mandal, said: We are happy. It has upheld my clients right to do business.        
	Keventer had apprehended that the Forward Bloc-run committee was not accepting the money so its licence lapsed.         
	The committees are under the state agri-marketing bo- ard, headed by Forward Bloc leader Naren Chatterjee who had publicly vowed to prevent the entry of big investors in wholesale and retail.         
	The board started sitting on the application after Keventer allowed Reliance Retail backdoor entry into Calcutta. Keventer sold fruits and vegetables in outlets of Reliance Fresh, which had been denied permission to sell farm produce.        
	Asked about todays order, Chatterjee said: Keventer Fresh had been issued a licence to do wholesale business in North 24-Parganas and we have no objection to that. However, the company was conducting retail business in Reliance Fresh outlets in Calcutta, which is beyond the jurisdiction of the licence. I should not say anything on the issue before going through the copy of the court order.         
	In its affidavit, Keventer told the court it had set up a processing plant at Barasat at an investment of over Rs 25 crore.         
	The company obtained the licence for selling farm produce on June 22, 2007. The licence was renewed till April 24, 2009. But the marketing authorities refused to accept the fees offered by the company for the next renewal.        
	The Barasat committee claimed before the court that it had issued the licence for Keventers wholesale business in North 24-Parganas. But it was conducting its business in other areas, including Calcutta. We have no objection if the company does its business within North 24-Parganas.        
	The trial bench judge, ho-wever, asked the committee to accept the fees.         
	A court source said: The trial judge did not restrain the company from conducting its business in areas outside North 24-Parganas.         
	The regulated market committee did not carry out the order and moved the division bench, seeking a stay. The plea was dismissed today.         
	According to central rules, domestic investors can run retail as well as wholesale outlets while 100 per cent foreign investment is allowed in wholesale ventures.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Rash-driver law stuck in union pothole
                                                                                                               Rash-driver law stuck in union pothole
          OUR LEGAL REPORTER                          People crowd around the bus on the railway tracks. Picture by Pradip Sanyal                                  
	Howrah, July 4: Todays minibus tragedy has brought under sharp focus the state governments delay in implementing a seven-member panels recommendation to severely punish drivers involved in fatal accidents.        
	The CPM-led government failed to carry out the suggestion because of stiff resistance from the partys labour arm, Citu.        
	An expert committee the government had set up to look into the rise in road accidents had recommended four months ago that both Section 304 of the Indian Penal Code (culpable homicide not amounting to murder) and Section 304A (death due to negligence and rash driving) be applied against drivers after killer accidents.        
	The recommendation was that a rule be established to have both sections in place, an official said.         
	A police inquiry would reveal whether the accident could have been averted. If it could, the recommendation was that Section 304 be slapped; if it could not, then the other section.                        A tyre of the bus on a railway track. (Pradip Sanyal)      
	The officer said such a rule would have been a deterrent to rash driving since the punishment under Section 304 can go up to life imprisonment. Section 304A, which is now routinely used, is bailable and carries a maximum punishment of up to two years in jail.        
	Opposition from trade unions has stopped us from going ahead with the committees recommendation. But we will eventually implement it, said Sumantra Chowdhury, special secretary in the state transport department.        
	Citu general secretary Kali Ghosh accepted that his organisation had opposed the imposition of Section 304.        
	We feel the drivers are not solely responsible for the accidents, he said. There are several factors like bad road conditions, lack of awareness among pedestrians and the pressure from bus owners to stick to timetables.        
	An official in the transport department said the driver of the minibus involved in todays accident had been booked under Section 304.        
	But that is only because the Howrah superintendent of police has used his discretion. Had a rule been in place, the driver would have known the consequences he would face for rash driving and, perhaps, would have been more careful. Many lives may have been saved.        
	Chowdhury conceded that a lot more needed to be done to shackle errant drivers.        
	There are plans to set up a team of experts who will make spot visits to find out if the traffic system is functioning properly and whether rules are being obeyed, the special secretary said.

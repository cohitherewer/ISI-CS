	Kharagpur, June 18: A BSF jawan whose battalion was supposed to go to Lalgarh to take part in the anti-Maoist operation was found dead at the forces base camp in Kharagpur today.         
	Local police are not clear whether 28-year-old Somu Singh from Jharkhand committed suicide. He is said to have died while cleaning his rifle. Whether the bullet that pierced his chest got fired accidentally is being probed. We cant confirm if he committed suicide or if it was an accident. We have sent the body for post-mortem, said a police officer.        
	Singh, of Number 18 battalion, was taken to Kharagpur state general hospital but died on the way.

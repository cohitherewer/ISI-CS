          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Calcutta, Dec. 16: Industries minister Nirupam Sen told the Assembly today a political consensus was necessary to set up industry in Singur and that the railways should inspect the abandoned Tata Motors project site and help the state by sending details about their proposed coach factory.        
	The railway proposal has opened up the scope for industry on (the) Singur land. I see a silver lining in it. The state Congress, too, wants industry there. According to me, a political consensus is necessary to set up a factory there. So, the railways should pay a visit to Singur and inspect the land. It would be good if they send us project-specific details as that would help us, Sen said.        
	State chief secretary Asok Mohan Chakrabarti wrote to the Railway Board today thanking it for having expressed interest in the Singur land.        
	Explaining the necessity of the site inspection by the railways, the minister added: The infrastructure in Singur was created for a car factory. But now theres talk of having a (train) coach factory there. So, the railways should go to see from which portions of the 997 acres available there they would like to carve out the 600 acres (they require). There is a power sub-station, buildings, sheds and a vendor park. The railways will be able to identify the land they need if the inspection is done.        
	A few days ago, railway minister Mamata Banerjee had ruled out the inspection on the ground that the land was still in the Tatas possession.        
	Sen said that shouldnt be an issue. Central public sector unit Bhel had only recently conducted a survey of the site in the presence of Tata representatives. If the railways visit the spot, Tata representatives can be brought in. There are no issues about it.        
	The minister said he had spoken to Tata Motors after the railway proposal came. In principle, the Tatas dont have any objection to giving up the land. I have had a talk with Tata Motors, not Ratan Tata. They have said that if theres any meaningful investment and the land is used for a public purpose, they will not object, he said.         
	Asked about the compensation that the Tatas could claim, he added: Let the railways first make a move. We are exploring avenues on how to make the railway proposal feasible.        
	Mamata had earlier ruled out going ahead with the project until the state government returned the 400 acres that she claimed had been forcibly acquired, though, according to the law, plots acquired for industry cannot be returned to original owners.        
	Sen asked: From where have they got this (400-acre) figure? How did they arrive at it? In the public sector, the railways are the biggest (concern). They keep acquiring large tracts of land for their projects. So, they must be conversant with land acquisition rules and legalities.        
	Earlier this year, the state land and land reforms minister had told the Assembly that only 137 acres were disputed.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Mamata wants damages
                                                                                                               Mamata wants damages
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Mamata Banerjee at the news conference on Friday. (Pradip Sanyal)                                  
	Calcutta, Sept. 4: Mamata Banerjee today said she wanted compensation for farmers whose land had been forcibly acquired by the promoters of Vedic Village with the help of CPM leaders.        
	The Vedic Village promoters have forcibly grabbed land from poor farmers with the help of CPM leaders in the Rajarhat area. We shall press for adequate compensation for them (the landlosers) by launching a day-long protest on Tuesday, the Trinamul Congress chief told a news conference at the party headquarters.         
	Tuesdays rally will be held on the same Sikharpur football ground where a dispute over a referees offside decision on August 23 had sparked a clash that went on to burn the resort and open a can of worms over deals struck by its promoters. Sections of both Trinamul and the government have been accused of being in league with them.        
	Land shark Gaffar Mollah, whose goons had shot dead a boy during the clash, has been linked with Trinamul. Party MLA Arabul Hossains name has also cropped up in connection with the deals.        
	Trinamul sources said Mamatas announcement came after some functionaries asked her whether the party had reservations against launching an offensive on the issue at an extended core committee meeting this afternoon.        
	Some Trinamul leaders were critical about the role of Bhangar MLA Arabul, whose brother Sirajul is said to have close links with Gaffar. The party should spell out its stand on Arabul, one of them said.        
	In response, Mamata said Arabul was being dragged into the controversy by the CPM. He is a member of a neighbourhood committee for landlosers as he represents Bhangar. We are certain he has nothing to do with the land deals in Vedic Village. But if a probe finds him involved, he will have to fight it legally on his own, the Trinamul chief said later.        
	A leader from North 24-Parganas told Mamata the Congress had already held a demonstration and tried to steal a march on her. Didi immediately decided on Tuesdays rally, said one of those present.

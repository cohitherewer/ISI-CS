The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Aid workers caged, needy left in lurch   Security excuse for rights violation
                                                                                                               Aid workers caged, needy left in lurch     -  Security excuse for rights violation
          OUR BUREAU                          The aid workers inside the godown on Sunday                                        
	Basanti (South 24-Parganas), June 1: Officials sought to build a security shield around a decision to pen up aid workers in a cramped room yesterday for two hours till the chief minister left but human rights activists said those responsible could be punished if formal charges were pressed against them.        
	Day labourers unloading cyclone relief materials from trucks at the block office here were herded inside a room and told to stay put behind a collapsible gate.        
	Police told us we need to go inside in view of the chief ministers security concerns. And so we went in, said Babla Ghosh, a resident of Basanti who spent around two hours in the godown with 24 others till Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee finished taking stock of the relief work with the district administration.         
	Although the collapsible gate was not locked, it was very stuffy inside, Babla said.         
	An hour before Bhattacharjee arrived around 9am, police officers managing his security asked the labourers to go into the godown. They were allowed to step out around 11, after the VIP convoy had left.         
	Security was the main concern as we did not want a crowd around the block office, confirmed a South 24-Parganas police officer.         
	Told that the labourers could have been asked to disperse and come back later, the officer said: It would have been difficult to regroup them and that would have affected the relief work.        
	Human rights activists said it was a punishable offence.        
	In Calcutta, home secre- tary Ardhendu Sen, however, denied the confinement of the villagers. These are artificial and distorted reports. Nothing of this kind happened, he said.        
	Relief minister Mortaza Hossain put his own spin to the incident. They were inside the room and may have been asked to stay there for security reasons, particularly when the chief minister was visiting the area. So there isnt any question of locking them up, he said.        
	Sujato Bhadra of the Association for Protection of Democratic Rights called it inhuman, cruel and degrading treatment of human beings.         
	It is punishable under UN conventions, he said. The aggrieved can lodge a complaint with the human rights commission, which can also start a case on its own.        
	If those found guilty are government officials, they can be censured or transferred.         
	The commission can also order the government to pay compensation to those affected, said Bhadra.        
	Justice N.C. Sil, the acting chief of the state human rights commission, said he would take up the matter if a formal complaint was lodged. Illegal confinement of any person is a punishable offence. If such a complaint is lodged with the commission, Ill place the matter before the other members for discussion. Action against the offenders will be decided at that meeting.

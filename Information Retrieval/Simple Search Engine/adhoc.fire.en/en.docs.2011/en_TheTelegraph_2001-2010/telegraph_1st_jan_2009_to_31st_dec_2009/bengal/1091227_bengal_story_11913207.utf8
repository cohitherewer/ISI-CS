The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Tata plot return
                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      Tata plot return
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Calcutta, Dec. 26: Chief secretary Asok Mohan Chakrabarti today said the government was about to start the formal process to get the Singur land back form the Tatas.        
	Asked if the government would ask for the land, he said: Certainly. Land not being used for the purpose for which it was given has to be returned. We are formalising things. An alternative has to be worked out as it is lying unused. We are in talks with the Tatas.        
	Ratan Tata has said he is willing to return the land but only lieu of compensation for the money Tata Motors has spent on the abandoned project.        
	The chief secretary had earlier said the land could be got back overnight but an official today said: Even if all sides are willing, getting the land is going to be time-consuming.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | CPM leader gunned down 
                                                                                                               CPM leader gunned down 
                            
	Midnapore, July 18: Maoist guerrillas gunned down a CPM zonal committee member in Jhargram today, cocking a snook at the thousands of security personnel conducting area domination exercises in neighbouring Lalgarh.        
	Jaladhar Mahato was returning home from a party meeting in Jhargram town when seven or eight youths surrounded him. They left the body on the banks of a canal half a kilometre from his home, on the outskirts of Jhargram town.        
	Even after hearing about the brazen attack, police did not dare to go to the spot. Villagers collected the body around 8pm and brought it to a hospital.        
	With Mahatos death, the number of CPM leaders and supporters killed by suspected Maoists since the forces marched into Lalgarh has gone up to five. Mahato, 56, the only prominent leader among the five, was a known Maoist target.        
	Hours before the murder, the Maoists circulated a fresh hit list naming several West Midnapore CPM leaders. Posters with the names of district committee member Haralal Mahato, local committee secretary Satadal Mahato and several others were pasted at Manickpara, 20km from Jhargram.         
	As the word spread, around 250 CPM activists in areas close to Lalgarh put up signed posters declaring they were dissociating themselves from the party.        
	In Goaltore, about 35km from Lalgarh, CPM supporter Ashok Ghosh was killed when he was about to shut his grocery store this evening.

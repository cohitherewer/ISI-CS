	Alipurduar, Oct. 19: Five people were hit when police opened fire to quell resistance outside a gambling den at a fair in Jalpaiguri district early this morning.         
	An officer stabbed with a broken liquor bottle was among nine policemen injured.        
	The Kali Puja fair near Banarhat, 80km from Alipurduar town, had a few hundred people even at 2am, when the police raided the den.        
	Outnumbered in the den, Banarhat inspector-in-charge S.C. Barman was stabbed several times and hit on the head. Assistant sub-inspector Samir Majumdar was hit with stones and driver Ashis Nandi was thrashed. The six other cops in the team of nine also took blows.        
	Forty policemen came half-an-hour later and fired in the air, but in vain. Then they opened fire.         
	One of the five people hit was a woman. Badal Kharia, who lives in the Binnaguri Tea Estate, said: Seema Rai was next to me when I heard gunshots and saw her fall. She was bleeding from the leg and we put her in a car and took her to Jalpaiguri (60km away).        
	Three others were hit in the legs. The fifth, Mohammad Khodauddin Ansari, was shot in the stomach.         
	Badal said: There was chaos. Everyone was running for shelter.         
	Ananda Oraon, who also lives in the garden, was hit by a bullet below the right knee. People were making merry like every year when all hell broke loose, he said in hospital.         
	A doctor at the Jalpaiguri hospital said the condition of the two policemen, Barman and Nandi, was serious.         
	North Bengal IG K.L. Tamta said the police fired 25 rounds to rescue the nine trapped.

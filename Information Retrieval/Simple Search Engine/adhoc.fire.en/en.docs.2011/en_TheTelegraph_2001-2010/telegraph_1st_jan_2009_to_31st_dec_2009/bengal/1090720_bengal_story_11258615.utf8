The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Delhi rejects statehood, offers hill autonomy
                                                                                                               Delhi rejects statehood, offers hill autonomy
          OUR BUREAU                          A Darjeeling boy leaves for his boarding school  St Augustines, Kalimpong  on Sunday. (Suman Tamang)                                  
	July 19: Union minister Pranab Mukherjee today summarily ruled out splitting Bengal and creating a separate state at a time the Gorkha Janmukti Morcha has made Gorkhaland a condition for talks to end the hill impasse.        
	We are willing to grant Sixth Schedule status to the Darjeeling hills. And we are also willing to sit with them (the Morcha) so we can also look into what extra powers we can give them, but we will not allow the division of Bengal, the finance minister said at Raiganj, North Dinajpur.         
	Under the Sixth Schedule of the Constitution, a region gets more autonomy to run the local administration.        
	Without naming the outfit, which has called an indefinite bandh in the hills and paralysed its administration and ec- onomy, the finance minister said: The problem in the hills is going on for a long time and now some people are flexing their muscles. If they continue to remain unmoved to our offer (of autonomy), well have to think of something else.         
	Asked what he meant by something else, Mukherjee said: It will depend on the situation at the time.        
	At a time the Bengal government has almost given a free hand to anarchy in various parts of the state, including Darjeeling, the words served as a reminder of the rule of law.        
	Mukherjee did not spare the Bengal governments inaction. Talking to reporters before boarding his helicopter, he accused the Left Front regime of keeping the Darjeeling hills simmering for a long time and not trying for a permanent solution.         
	After the Morcha called the indefinite hill bandh last week, the Centre convened a meeting involving the outfit and the state government. Its date was brought forward from August 24 to August 11 yesterday as a goodwill gesture following a Morcha demand.        
	But the outfit has not responded to the offer, apparently because the Centre has been silent on its two other demands  Gorkhaland as its sole agenda and talks at the political level, not with bureaucrats.        
	We had clearly stated our three demands before the government, Morcha chief Bimal Gurung said.        
	Sources in Delhi said the UPA government was not prepared for a political discussion and if the BJP MP from Darjeeling, Jaswant Singh, insisted on attending the meeting, it could be a thorny issue.        
	The Morcha wants Singh to attend the meeting.         
	It had also wanted the talks before the budget session ended on August 7, but the Centre has clarified that August 11 is the earliest possible date.        
	The Morcha today decided to relax its strike for 10 hours  8am to 6pm  tomorrow but asserted that it was not in response to the Centres goodwill gesture yesterday.        
	On Friday, it exempted educational institutions, tea gardens and cinchona plantations from the strike.        
	Morcha central committee leader Amar Lama said in Darjeeling: Since the educational institutes are reopening tomorrow, we thought its essential to provide the relaxation.         
	Vehicles will be allowed and shops can open. But banks and government offices wont be spared.        
	However, primary schools will continue to remain shut.         
	Bank loan drive        
	The finance minister today attended a United Bank of India camp at Sagardighi, Murshi- dabad, where loans were giv- en to farmers, self-help groups and businessmen on the 40th anniversary of bank nationalisation. Mukherjee attended a similar programme at Raiganj. Loans worth Rs 67 crore were given to 11,111 people.

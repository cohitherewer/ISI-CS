The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | CPM at Vedic war, inside amp; out
                                                                                                               CPM at Vedic war, inside amp; out
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Calcutta, Aug. 28: The CPM state secretariat met today to discuss the fresh land row over Vedic Village and moves to clear the mess that it fears can push it further on the backfoot even as a blame game raged within the party.        
	Chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee told his colleagues at the meeting that he would not shield any wrongdoers and take action.         
	He apparently said he had been receiving complaints of illegal and immoral activities in Vedic Village but there were no specific charges.         
	Now that we have got something specific, we will probe it till the very end and spare none, the chief minister was quoted as saying.        
	Later, making it clear that he was speaking for both the party and the government, secretariat member and housing minister Gautam Deb told a news conference: The government and the party are seriously concerned about the incidents related to the resort and complaints of land-grabbing by its authorities. The government will soon come out with the facts and figures on it.         
	The party wants the truth to be laid bare, he added. After the Lok Sabha polls, we had said we would not hide it if we make a mistake. Let the truth come out. The party will take action if there are wrongdoers among us.        
	The minister who had handled the governments acquisition of hundreds of acres in Rajarhat raised questions about land minister Abdur Rezzak Mollahs decision to lease the land to the resort, though without naming them.         
	Mollah had been the most vocal dissenter during the governments drive to acquire land for industry.        
	However, in an apparent balancing act, Deb also pulled up police, which is under the chief minister himself. We need to know the terms and conditions on which government land was leased to the resorts promoters. Second, did they need 1,500 acres for a resort? What is the relation of the proposed IT park and township with their projects? What did the police do when people complained about forcible land procurement using musclemen?         
	In an effort to distance the party from the resort owners, Deb said: We must know what the original purpose of Vedic Village was and whether its owners have stuck to it.         
	There was a clear indication that the CPM feared some of its own men could be behind the mess. We need to know who all are involved. If CPM members are involved, who are they and in what capacity did they play a part in it?         
	Fellow secretariat member and farmer wing leader Madan Ghosh defended the governments right to lease out its own land for infrastructure and industrial projects.         
	However, he did not support engagement of private players to procure land for government projects. We need to ask IT minister Debesh Das about the proposed joint sector IT park project, he said.        
	Reacting to Trinamul Congress MP Sudip Bandopadhyays demand that the government publish a list of ministers who had enjoyed the resorts hospitality, secretariat member Shyamal Chakraborty said:  Its no crime to visit a hotel or resort on being invited in an official capacity. But it was the Trinamul MLA of Bhangar whose musclemen helped in land-grabbing.

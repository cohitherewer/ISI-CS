The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Mamata pinches Cong
                                                                                                               Mamata pinches Cong
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Calcutta, July 20: Mamata Banerjee said she would not allow party workers to resort to bandhs or blockades on trivial grounds, days after her ally shut down Bengal and vandalised public property.        
	Things have changed. People have started voting for us in every election. So we cant do what other parties are doing at the drop of a hat, Mamata said this afternoon, without naming the Congress.        
	Trinamul Congress leaders had earlier said their chief had spotted in the Congresss moves a bid to steal the limelight as an Opposition party. Didi did not approve of the way Congress supporters torched and stoned buses. That is why she had refrained from commenting on the bandh, though she had lent moral support to it, said a general secretary.         
	Although Mamata did not explain what she meant by trivial grounds, her aides said issues like an attack on a party worker by supporters of the ruling party or arrest of a party activist on false charges should not be a ground for bandhs and blockades.        
	The Congress had called the bandh to protest the attack on its MLAs.        
	State Congress working president Subrata Mukherjee reminded Trinamul of its own record while reacting to Mamatas observations. We dont need lessons from Trinamul. They had unleashed violence on the roads to protest the ban on two-stroke autos. They had vandalised the Assembly in 2006 and set fire to Charu Market police station last year.        
	Trinamul leaders suggested those were things of the past. Our leaders had done many things on the spur of the moment. But we have learnt from experience that people dont support hooliganism, said Trinamul state president Subrata Bakshi.         
	Mamata has told her district units they must take their state leaders permission before calling bandhs or organising blockades. We are working on a code of conduct for them. Bandhs should be the last resort and only when they involve big public issues, she said.

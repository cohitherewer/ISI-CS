	Calcutta, May 15: The CPM is clinging to an internal pro- jection that has conceded 14 of the 42 seats to the Opposition but the Trinamul Congress warned the ruling party of nasty surprises.        
	Evidently in disagreement with the exit poll results that bestowed far larger spoils on Mamata, the CPMs poll managers today said the Left was expecting between 28 and 30 seats  a fall from the 35 in 2004 but two less than the alliances lowest tally in power in 1984.        
	Although the Oppositions highpoint is 15, we think the realistic best performance for them would be 14 seats, a senior CPM leader said. The state party secretariat met today to discuss poll-related issues.        
	Secretariat member Benoy Konar claimed the Left could win between 28 and 30 seats.        
	Like the CPM and its allies, Trinamul, too, crunched numbers and concluded there was reason to expect over 20 seats.         
	Mamata and her close ass-ociates believe her alliances performance under her leadership is going to become part of Bengals political lore. Its best in the past three decades has been the 1984 tally of 16, riding a wave of sympathy following Indira Gandhis assassination.         
	There will be plenty of nasty surprises for the CPM tomorrow, said Partha Chatterjee, leader of the Trinamul legislature party.         
	Several seats about which they are bullish now are going to come our way.         
	The CPM leadership believes the 12 seats the Left is almost certain to lose to Mamatas alliance and the BJP are: Calcutta South, Diamond Harbour, Tamluk, Barasat, Bongaon, Ranaghat, Jangipur, Behrampore, Malda South, Malda North, Darjeeling and Raiganj.         
	A section of the party also regards Mathurapur and Serampore as lost, but there is a strong view opposing it.        
	The CPM is hopeful of retaining four high-profile seats  Calcutta North, Jadavpur, Birbhum and Krishnagar.        
	But there are conflicting views within the CPM on the likely outcome for Jadavpur and Calcutta North, where the result possibly hinges on the behaviour of the Muslim and Hindi-speaking population.         
	In Calcutta North, voters in the trading hub of Burrabazar and surrounding areas are likely to play a critical role, while in Jadavpur, the Muslims of Baruipur and Bhangar possibly hold the key.        
	The CPM study, which got under way well before the polls, took into account factors like the relative strengths and weaknesses of the parties, efficiency of local units, quality of candidates and campaigns, shepherding of voters on polling day and possible swings.         
	We are going to lose Diamond Harbour for lack of organisational structure, a senior leader said. Similarly, we are hopeful of 100 per cent success in districts like Burdwan, Birbhum, Bankura, Purulia and West Midnapore, where the organisation is rock steady.         
	The study apparently suggests the swing of minority votes away from the Left may not be as substantial as feared on account of land acquisition and the Sachar Committee report. We have lost Muslim support and are going to lose a few seats owing to their switch in allegiance, a CPM central committee member said. But it isnt a large-scale switch. We have been able to arrest a good part of the slide that affected our showing in last years panchayat polls.         
	Many Trinamul leaders said in private they were looking at a best performance of 15 to 16 seats. However, their sure seats include Calcutta North, Jadavpur and Krishnagar.         
	Theres no way we are going to lose Calcutta North and Jadavpur, said Chatterjee.         
	Both the CPM and Trinamul are claiming that the seats would come to them on the strength of Muslim and Hindi-speaking voters.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Cong land jab at ally
                                                                                                               Cong land jab at ally
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Calcutta, Aug. 28: The Congress today demanded a CBI probe into Vedic Villages land deals in which an MLA of ally Trinamul Congress has come under the scanner along with a dreaded land shark.        
	The cry for such a probe is being seen as an attempt to embarrass Trinamul at a time some in the Congress believe the party should step out of Mamata Banerjees shadow.         
	Trinamul won two Assembly bypolls in central Calcutta last week after having refused to spare any of the seats for its partner.         
	Pitching for a CBI inquiry were state Congress working president Subrata Mukherjee and Raiganj MP Deepa Das Munshi, who are among those who believe the party should stop playing second fiddle to Trinamul.        
	Mukherjee said a party team would meet governor Gopalkrishna Gandhi tomorrow seeking the CBI inquiry. We are pressing for a CBI probe into Vedic Villages land deals as ministers, politicians and some senior government officials are involved, Mukherjee told a rally of the Congress students wing this morning.         
	Deepa echoed Mukherjee: Let the CBI conduct a probe since the names of politicians also figure on the Vedic Village land deals.        
	Hours later, at a rally of the Trinamul students wing, Mamata remained mum on the alleged involvement of her MLA Arabul Islam and his brother Khude in the land deals.         
	Trinamul sources, however, said Mamata had privately told aides before leaving for Delhi tonight to send her a report on Arabuls alleged role in the land acquisition. We have to send the report in a day or two, an aide said.         
	Bhangar MLA Arabul is alleged to have links with Gaffar Mollah, the main accused in Sundays violence at Vedic Village and a land shark suspected to have swung deals for the resorts owners.

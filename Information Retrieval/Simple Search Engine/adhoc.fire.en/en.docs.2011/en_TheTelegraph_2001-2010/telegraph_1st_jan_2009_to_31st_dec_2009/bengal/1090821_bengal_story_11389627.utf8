          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Calcutta, Aug. 20: The chief minister today reviewed the progress of the Nayachar chemical hub and instructed officials to stay in touch with Delhi, which still has to grant the project environment clearance.         
	Industries minister Nirupam Sen, finance minister Asim Dasgupta, chief secretary Asok Mohan Chakrabarti and industries secretary Sabyasachi Sen attended the meeting at Writers Buildings.        
	An official of the chief ministers secretariat said: We briefed the chief minister on the work progress with regard to the Nayachar project (Petroleum, Chemicals and Petrochemicals Investment Region). On his instructions, we will be in close touch with Delhi as the Union environment ministrys clearance is a must.        
	Sources in the Trinamul Congress said that given Mamata Banerjees opposition to the proposed chemical hub, the Centre was likely to go slow on the green clearance.        
	An industries department official said three things were discussed at the meeting, one of them being the environment assessment study. The second was the transfer of land for the project from the West Bengal Industrial Development Corporation to APC Roy Chemicals Limited, which will set up the PCPIR.        
	The third point was the MoU between the Centre and the state on infrastructure support to be given by the former.

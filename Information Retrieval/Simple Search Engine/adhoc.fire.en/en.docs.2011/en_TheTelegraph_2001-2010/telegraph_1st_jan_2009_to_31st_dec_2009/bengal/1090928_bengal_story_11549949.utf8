                                                                                                               Congress divided on civic leader selection
          OUR BUREAU                              
	Sept. 27: The Congress is divided on its choice of leader in the Siliguri Municipal Corporation when two days are left to submit documents concerning the selection of mayor and chairpersons of the civic body.         
	The faction-ridden party cannot choose from three councillors  Gangotri Dutta, Gauri Dutta and Nantu Pal.         
	Congress sources said of the 15 councillors, seven want Gangotri Dutta to be the leader because of her clean image and five are for Gauri Dutta for her seniority. Another three are in favour of Pal as he broke away from the CPM to join the party.         
	There is no denying that our party councillors are divided on the choice of leader for the corporation, said a Congress leader from Siliguri.        
	The mayor and the chairpersons have to be selected by September 30  the last date for submission of the papers to the SMC commissioner  as the new councillors will take oath on October 1.         
	Darjeeling Congress president Shankar Malakar has sought the state leaderships intervention. Party sources said Raiganj MP Deepa Das Munshi has also decided to take up the matter with Bengal Congress president Pranab Mukherjee. Pranabda will announce who will be our leader in a day or two, Malakar said.        
	Trinamul Congress leader Partha Chatterjee said: How can the Congress stake claim to the mayors post? Let them first decide who should be their leader.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Cong demands allys respect
                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      Cong demands allys respect
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Krishnagar, Dec. 5: The Congress today told Trinamul that it, too, mattered in Bengal politics and should be given the respect it deserves.        
	The words came from Pranab Mukherjee, the state Congress president, after a series of complaints from party leaders in Bengal on how Mamata Banerjee was belittling them. Dont undermine the Congress, Pranab said on the second day of the partys chintan baithak in Krishnagar, Nadia. Give our party the respect it deserves. Adhere to jot dharma (principles of alliance ), he added.        
	We must not make historic blunders at this juncture that might result in the loss of an opportunity to put an end to the 32-year-old misrule (of the Left) in Bengal.         
	Senior leaders such as AICC general secretary K. Keshava Rao, state Congress working president Pradip Bhattacharyya and MP Deepa Das Munshi were present at the conclave, about 110km from Calcutta, that ends tomorrow.         
	But Subrata Mukherjee, another working president who came to the conclave, stayed for just 20 minutes and left without giving any reason. Party sources said he was upset that the state unit did not have a full-time president.         
	In the 13-point memorandum submitted to the state Congress president, a section of leaders led by Deepa stated categorically that they want the alliance to continue and take it forward to the 2011 Assembly polls but not at the cost of our self-respect.         
	Mukherjee, however, acknowledged that the Congress had suffered the worst in 1998 when Mamata had left the party to float Trinamul. Although there were splits in the Congress in 1969 and 1978, the 1998 split was the worst. A majority of our leaders and workers, particularly those in south Bengal, moved out of the party along with Mamata. This hit us hard, he said.        
	Reacting to Pranabs stand, state Trinamul president Subrata Bakshi said: We dont subscribe to what Pranabbabu said. We pay due respect to the Congress but cannot accept their flings with the Left. What did they do in the Siliguri Municipal Corporation? Was that good of the Congress?

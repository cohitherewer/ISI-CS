          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Gangtok, Feb. 5: The Sikkim forest and environment department has signed a memorandum of understanding with the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) to carry out a feasibility study for a project on sustainable development of green resources in the state.        
	A Japanese team, which included Ryotaro Hayashi, the deputy assistant director of the South Asia division of JICA, and Vanit Sarin from the Delhi office of the organisation, signed the MoU with states principal chief conservator of forests S.T. Lachungpa on Monday.        
	The study will begin at the start of the next financial year and the first task will be to finalise the scope and details of the project, said Lachungpa. He added that the main thrust of the project would be to improve the standard of living of people who dwelt in the fringes of forest and also to protect forest resources.        
	The aim is to involve the people in conservation and to reduce their dependency on forest resources. We will also promote income-generating activities like eco-tourism in order to improve the economic condition of the forest villagers, said Lachungpa.        
	He added that a sense of ownership had already been inculcated among the villagers through ongoing projects of the forest department and through joint forest management committees and eco-development panels.        
	Lachungpa said the externally aided project would revive the sense of belonging among the forest dwellers and increase their awareness on the rich bio-diversity of the state. The project report is expected to be completed by October.

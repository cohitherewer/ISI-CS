The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Cong vows to bargain hard
                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      Cong vows to bargain hard
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Krishnagar, Dec. 6: The Congress today said it would bargain hard for seats with the Trinamul Congress before the 2011 Assembly elections in an apparent bid to placate sections of the party unhappy with the alleged surrender to Mamata Banerjee before the general election this summer.        
	We have to bargain hard and ask for more seats in 2011, state Congress president Pranab Mukherjee told the concluding session of a three-day conclave here.        
	The party, which had contested all 294 Assembly seats in 2006 when it did not have a pact with Trinamul, is likely to be happy if it gets 100 in 2011, said some of those attending the conclave.         
	When the two parties fought the state polls together in 2001, the Congress had contested only 57. Given that, it has to bargain really hard to get anywhere near the desired 100.         
	In the general election this year, the party had agreed on a 14-28 seat-sharing deal.        
	To press for more seats, we have to strengthen our organisation, Mukherjee said.        
	In Calcutta, Trinamul state president Subrata Bakshi said it was too early to discuss seat sharing for 2011.         
	Behrampore MP Adhir Chowdhury and several others had accused the party of bowing to Mamatas diktats. He went on to say that party workers in his district, Murshidabad, should be told in advance how many seats the Congress would get to fight in 2011.        
	At the conclave, Raiganj MP Deepa Das Munshi slammed Mamata almost in the manner of the Left. Im called anti-alliance, but can we sit idle if somebody regularly unveils railway projects with central funds and breaks the Congress into pieces? she asked.        
	Although Deepa got support from Nadia president Shankar Singh, a majority of those present told Mukherjee they were wary about sending a wrong message to Mamata.        
	Our primary objective is to free Bengal of Left misrule. So we should all work keeping in mind that the alliance is a political necessity, Mukherjee told the delegates.         
	He told a news conference later Mamata would be the alliances chief ministerial candidate. We had projected Mamata Banerjee (as the chief ministerial candidate) in 2001. We accepted her as the leader during this years Lok Sabha elections. So we will have no problem in projecting her as the chief ministerial candidate for the Assembly polls in 2011.        
	At the conclave yesterday, Mukherjee had urged Mamata not to belittle the Congress.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | At work: rally machine
                                                                                                               At work: rally machine

	Calcutta, July 21: Tuesdays rally was not only a reflection of Mamata Banerjees growing popularity  evident from last years panchayat to this years parliamentary polls  but also the hard work by her party leaders who mobilised crowds from the districts.        
	Just after the Lok Sabha polls (in May), Mamata told us we would not be holding a victory rally, said a Trinamul Congress general secretary.         
	Instead, she wanted a huge July 21 gathering which, for her, would be a victory rally as well.        
	Preparations for July 21 began two months ago with booth-level meetings to plan how to bring the hordes to Calcutta. Party functionaries went door to door in East Midnapore and the two 24-Parganas to ask people to join the rally.         
	We held several big rallies in the districts and street-corner and booth-level meetings to mobilise public opinion in favour of the rally, said a party leader.         
	A fortnight back, Mamata asked the district units to organise buses. A leader said the directive was especially for the south Bengal leaders because that was where the party had done exceptionally well in all elections in the past year.        
	According to police estimates, around 1,700 buses, trucks and vans were used to ferry the crowd today.        
	We had collected subscription from people to raise funds for the transport, a leader said.        
	Four men in Calcutta had been assigned the overall task of ensuring the turnout  leader of Opposition Partha Chatterjee, state party chief Subrata Bakshi, general secretary Mukul Roy, and youth wing leader Madan Mitra.         
	We had a target of bringing in five lakh people. But the number was much higher today, claimed Mitra.        
	Bakshi said the turnout was a result of their hard work. Many more would have come had there been no rain. A large number of people who came braving the rain returned home unable to get anywhere near the podium.        
	Birbhum murder         
	A Trinamul worker was killed this afternoon in Birbhums Nanoor. A gang chased motorcycle-borne Ashok Das, 30, and shot him.

	Santiniketan, Aug. 23: The CBI has abandoned its inves-tigation into the theft of Rabindranath Tagores Nobel medallion.        
	In a letter to Visva-Bharati dated August 20, the bureaus special crime branch has said it is closing the case in the absence of clues.         
	We received the letter on Friday (August 21). The CBI informed us that it had closed the investigation as it could not find enough clues to progress, said the universitys registrar, Manimukut Mitra.        
	The theft of the medal and other priceless memorabilia from the museum on the varsity campus came to light on March 25, 2004. Burglars had broken in through a window. Among the 52 other items they took were a gold pocket watch Tagore used, a Baluchari sari his wife wore, silverware, ivory artefacts, jewellery and se-veral paintings.         
	The CBI took up the case six days later and found three ivory statuettes and a walking stick on Day I. The statuettes were wrapped in a cloth and hidden behind a copy of a Tagore painting hanging from the museum wall. The stick was under an almirah.        
	The sleuths hinted repeatedly that a theft of such a magnitude was impossible without inside help, but could not make headway even after questioning around 100 university employees.        
	This is the not the first time the CBI has closed the case. It did so once in 2007 and reopened it a year later, apparently after receiving fresh clues.        
	CBI officers in Calcutta were not available for comment today.         
	Vice-chancellor Rajat Kanta Ray expressed his dismay over the CBI move. The ashram community had got a new lease of hope (when the investigation was restarted last September) but now the hopes have been dashed, he said.        
	Mamata Banerjee expressed shock. I dont understand why the CBI has decided to close the case. I want the central agency to start the investigation afresh and more seriously. There is a deep mystery behind the theft and a search has to be launched for those involved in it, she said.        
	Its a shame if we have to remain satisfied with a replica of Tagores medal. I will talk to (Union finance minister) Pranab Mukherjee tomorrow about the CBI decision, the railway minister said before leaving for Delhi this afternoon.         
	The university had obtained the replica from the Nobel authorities.        
	In Santiniketan, Supriya Mukhopadhyay, son of Tagore biographer Prabhat Mukho- padhyay, said: We are surprised that the CBI drew a blank. We are disappointed.        
	Teachers and non-teaching staff said they would write to the President and the Prime Minister, the universitys visitor and chancellor, requesting them to get the probe resumed.        
	The CBI has submitted a confidential report on its investigation to the Bolpur additional chief judicial magistrates court.

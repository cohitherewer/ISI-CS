The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | IISCO strike
                                                                                                               IISCO strike
                            
	Durgapur, May 20: The labourers who had stalled work on the IISCO modernisation project returned to work today.        
	About 7,000 people engaged by contractors to work on the revamp had not been working since Monday, demanding a job for the family of a colleague killed at work. The strike was called off after the contractor paid about Rs 1.8 lakh in compensation to the dead workers father. However, the Congress union that had called the strike said the demand for the job was not being withdrawn.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Mamata expense defence
                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      Mamata expense defence
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Calcutta, Nov. 22: Railway minister Mamata Banerjee today defended her right to appoint members of the culture clan to the utilitys committees.        
	It is my discretion whom I appointment to the committees, she told STAR Ananda.        
	Theatre artiste Shaonli Mitra was reluctant to accept a position on a heritage panel, Mamata said, adding that she had forced her. Capable people with experience should be take part in the policy-making process, she said. Shaonlidi is in favour of change and so is she bad and Soumitra (Chatterjee) is their (the CPMs) friend and so he is good?         
	She said there was nothing wrong in Mitra being paid Rs 50,000 a month for this. People in their profession can earn that amount in a day, Mamata said. But it is the rule in the government to pay someone for doing a job.         
	Without naming MP Kabir Suman, who had spoken up against alleged attempts by some Trinamul leaders to control the use of development funds, Mamata said everyone should follow party discipline.        
	Any individuals opinion is not the opinion of 10 lakh Trinamul Congress members. Politicians know how to work in a political party. But some people from outside the political stream may say something once in a while and we have to accept it, she said.        
	She alleged that Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee and other ministers used tinted glasses in their cars but police were taking no action. Satabdi Roy is being harassed. But they (actors) keep tinted glasses for protection. One fine morning, the government decided to conduct a crackdown.

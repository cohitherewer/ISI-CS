   3-foot crater at blast spot
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          The spot where Maoists blew up the railway line in Purulia. (Mita Roy)                                        
	Purulia, Oct. 3: Maoists last night triggered an explosion that ripped off three feet of a railway track in Purulia and held up trains for over 14 hours.         
	This is the first major blast in any railway division in south Bengal, a senior railway official said in Calcutta.         
	No one was injured in the attack around midnight, believed to be the rebels bid to enforce an all-India bandh today to protest the arrest of Chhatradhar Mahato, the leader of the Maoist-backed Peoples Committee Against Police Atrocities.         
	The site of the blast is about a kilometre from Urma station, around 25km from Purulia. The blast happened in the Adra-Chandil section of south eastern railway.        
	The explosion was so powerful that it blew a three-foot section of the track about 100m away, tore overhead wires and left a crater over three-foot-deep.         
	The station master at Urma, Ratan Karketta, said the bomb went off at 11.47pm.         
	Hours later, another explosion was reported, this time in the Rourkela-Chakradharpur section, in Jharkhand around 1.45am. This blast damaged about 10m of a railway track. The blast spot is near the border of Jharkhand and Orissa, states with strong Maoist presence.         
	The Howrah-bound Gitanjali Express which takes this route was stopped at Jharsuguda in Orissa.         
	Station master Karketta said: Some persons on the platform (in Urma) saw a flash of light followed immediately by a loud sound. A goods train had passed the spot just a few seconds before. Its driver informed the signal room about the blast.         
	The station control and security control rooms at Adra, the divisional headquarters of south eastern railway, were immediately informed. All movement of trains was stopped within 12 minutes of the blast, said Purulia station master S.P. Majumdar.         
	Last nights blast spot near Adra is not far from where another explosion, of lesser intensity, damaged the same tracks on the eve of the chief ministers visit to Purulia on July 19. Train services had resumed within a couple of hours then.         
	On June 22, a line man found a powerful improvised explosive device 100m from Biramdih station in the same Adra-Chandil section.         
	All three incidents happened on days the Maoists had called strikes.        
	Divisional security commissioner S.K. Rajbangshi reached the Purulia blast spot this morning. The explosion was quite strong. Besides the tracks and overhead wires on both the up and down tracks, panto rods (which support the overhead wires) and two concrete sleepers were destroyed, he said.        
	Divisional railway manager A.K. Garkare said up services (towards Chandil) resumed at 9.25 this morning, while down services (towards Purulia and Adra) resumed at 2pm.         
	Senior Railway Protection Force personnel said wires and metal fragments, possibly parts of the bomb, were found and sent to forensic labs to determine the nature of the explosives.        
	Houses torched        
	About a hundred Maoists raided two villages in West Midnapore and torched seven houses  two of CPM leaders and five of other activists tonight.         
	The rebels were looking for CPM panchayat leader Renupada Singh and local branch committee secretary Lakshman Ghosh. When they did not find them in Nayagram and Tushbandhi, they marched their families out and set their houses on fire. Later, the group went to Ausbandhi village and set fire to the five other houses.

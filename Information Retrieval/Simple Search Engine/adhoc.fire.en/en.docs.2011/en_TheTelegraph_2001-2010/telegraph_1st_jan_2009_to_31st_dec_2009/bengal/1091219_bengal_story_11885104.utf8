                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      Karat urges allies to fight united
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Calcutta, Dec. 18: Prakash Karat today reminded partners who have openly blamed the CPM for the Lefts poll debacles about their collective responsibility to defend the Bengal government in the face of vicious attacks from the Trinamul-Maoist combine.        
	Addressing the opening session of the Forward Bloc congress, the CPM general secretary admitted the need to introspect on the Left Fronts achievements and failures, shortcomings and weaknesses.         
	He accepted that biggest partner CPMs responsibility in the course correction was the biggest, but added: All the parties in the Left Front have collective roles to play. If we can move united, we can reach out to the people who have drifted away from us. We have to fight back united when our party cadres are facing vicious attacks from the Trinamul-Maoist combine.         
	Karat did not elaborate on mistakes the state government or his party may have made but pinned his turnaround hopes on the Lefts ability to hit the streets on aam admi issues like price rise, unemployment and burdens on farmers.         
	Speaking before Karat, his CPI counterpart A.B. Bardhan took a pot shot at the Big Brother. In the interest of truth, let us also admit that in the course of this long rule, certain blunders and errors occurred and many values got blunted, Bardhan said.         
	Sharing his common opinion with the Bloc on the criticism of the state government and the CPM, the CPI leader stressed on the the bigger party bearing a bigger share (of the blame).         
	People have warned us to correct ourselves, and become a better Left front, worthy of the people. We have no time to lose, Bardhan added, hinting at the 2011 Assembly polls.

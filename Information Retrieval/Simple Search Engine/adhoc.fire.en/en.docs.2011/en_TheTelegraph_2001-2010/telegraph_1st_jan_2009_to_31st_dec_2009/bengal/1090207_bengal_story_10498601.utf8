The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Nayachar race before elections 
                                                                                                               Nayachar race before elections 
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Calcutta, Feb. 6: The Centres final nod to the Nayachar chemical hub may trigger a tussle between the government and the Opposition before the Lok Sabha elections, leaders from both sides indicated today.         
	The CPM and the state government want a quick approval from the Union cabinet of the chemical hub, to come up on the Nayachar island, before dates are announced for the general election.        
	The government may use the Centres approval to offset the loss of face it suffered after the Nano project moved out of Singur. That the hub  it was to come up in Nandigram initially but shifted after a bitter land war  is about to get the final nod is good news for the government before the polls.         
	We have requested the Centre to give the final clearance to the Nayachar project before the Lok Sabha polls. The empowered committee of secretaries has given its nod. It will take some time, may be two weeks, before the Union cabinet decides, industries minister Nirupam Sen said after the CPMs weekly state secretariat meeting today.         
	But Trinamul Congress chief Mamata Banerjee made it clear that she would oppose the hub even in Nayachar. We will leave no stone unturned to oppose a chemical hub in the state, she said at her Kalighat residence.        
	This time, Mamata cited environmental concerns. She said foreign chemical giants like Dow had been invited to set up units in the hub. We cannot forget that Dow (which acquired Union Carbide) was involved in the Bhopal gas tragedy that killed thousands, she said today. Left partner RSP had also raised the same concerns.         
	Sen, however, dismissed the opposition as baseless.

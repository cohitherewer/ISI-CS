  - Man hacked after stopping show hurting examinees         OUR CORRESPONDENT                                    
	Behrampore, March 4: A man and his sister were hacked with a scythe in a Murshidabad village last night after he protested against blaring sound boxes at a video show that was disturbing two Madhyamik examinees in the village.        
	Gopal Majumdar, among the few graduates at Namile village, about 220km from Calcutta, has received 23 stitches for injuries on his back, hands and forehead. His sister Suchitra, 22, who was hit on the neck, needed three stitches.        
	Police said a group of villagers were playing Shah Rukh Khan-starrer Rab Ne Bana Di Jodi next to a Shiv temple with two sound boxes fitted to the CD player turned to full volume. The show started around 6pm with a Bengali film.         
	Two Madhyamik examinees live about 10 metres from the temple and they were preparing for their Wednesdays physical science paper. They couldnt study because of the noise and protested. But the villagers watching the movie, most of them school dropouts, brushed them aside, a police officer said.        
	Gopal, 31, and his brother, Kanaj, 29, returning home around 9.45pm after chatting to friends, saw the two students pleading with the organisers to lower the volume of the speakers. The siblings asked the villagers to stop the show for the sake of the secondary examinees.        
	We requested the organisers to stop the show but they did not pay any heed to us. So, Gopal pulled the plug out of its socket in the temple from where power was being stolen. He also tore the wire so they could not put the plug back in the socket, said Kanaj, also a graduate like his elder brother.        
	The brothers returned home as the organisers hurled abuses at them and threatened them with dire consequences.        
	Around 11pm, Gopal Bairagi, one the organisers of the show, barged into the Majumdars house. I was in the courtyard and he came at me hard. I was hit on the forehead and hands as I raised them to protect my face. He also hit me on the back when I turned away to flee. My sister rushed out to help me and got hit, Gopal said from his hospital bed.        
	Gopal and Kanaj help their father manage his large farm property.        
	Murshidabad superintendent of police B.L. Meena said Gopal fled after the incident. He has been charged with attempt to murder.        
	Many shocked villagers said they were also on the lookout for Gopal. We will catch him and hand him over to the police, said Samir Biswas, a primary school teacher.        
	Using loudspeakers and boxes during board exams is a punishable offence. Lawyer Gitanath Ganguly said those guilty could be jailed for 15 days and fined Rs 1 lakh.         
	The Murshidabad police chief said efforts were on to identify the organisers of the video show. The owner of the store from where they hired the equipment could also be charged with the offence.

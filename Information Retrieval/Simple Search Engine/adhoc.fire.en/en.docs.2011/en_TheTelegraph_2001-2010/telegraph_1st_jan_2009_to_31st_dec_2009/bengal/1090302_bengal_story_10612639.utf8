The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Land plea
                                                                                                               Land plea
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Calcutta, March 1: The state government has placed a demand before the Centre to bypass competitive bidding so that it can buy closed central government units in Bengal.         
	Delhi asks us to join the open bidding for such land, which means competing with rich corporate houses and that is not practical, said industries minister Nirupam Sen at the inauguration of a textile hub, Paridhan, off EM Bypass.        
	If these units are handed over to us at the reserve price (the lowest price fixed for the bids), we can set up more industrial hubs, said Sen.

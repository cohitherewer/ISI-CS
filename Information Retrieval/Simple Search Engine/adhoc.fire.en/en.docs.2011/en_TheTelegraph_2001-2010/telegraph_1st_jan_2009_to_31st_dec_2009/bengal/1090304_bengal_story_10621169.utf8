          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Alipurduar, March 3: A former panchayat member was arrested today on charges of killing her two-year-old daughter.        
	Sadhana, who was accused of the murder by her husband and elder daughter, a higher secondary student, had been kept tied to a tree by villagers of Aswini Nagar till police arrived.         
	Mohua Saha, the elder daughter and a higher secondary candidate, studied till 1am and went to bed with her two sisters, including the two-year-old Ashima. About 5.30am, when Mohua woke up, she found that Ashima was cold.         
	Mohua started screaming that her mother had killed Ashima. The baby was taken to Madarihat Health Centre where she was declared brought-dead.         
	Local people, who had rushed to the house, tied Sadhana to a tree and informed the Madarihat police. They soon reached the spot and arrested the woman.        
	Mohon Saha, the Sadhanas husband, lodged a complaint accusing her of the murder. The body was brought to Alipurduar hospital for post-mortem.         
	Shyamali Choudhury, the local panchayat member, said Sadhana had never wanted the baby and did not want to bring the girl home from hospital. Her husband had taken the newborn to the house and started looking after her. All the three siblings would sleep on the same bed, while the mother was in another room.         
	Choudhury said Sadhana had accused her husband of having an affair with another woman. The allegation was baseless. Three months ago, I interfered and tried to make her see sense. Last week, Sadhana had hit Mohon with a utensil and ever since, he has been staying in his sisters house.        
	The panchayat member said Sadhana had tried to kill the girl, but failed. Mohon said: From the very first day, my wife could not tolerate Ashima. I looked after the baby with the help of my family members. Last night, she took the baby from the bed and gave it milk which had been mixed with poison.         
	S.R. Misra, the additional superintendent of police of Alipurduar, said the woman would be produced in the court of additional chief judicial magistrate tomorrow.

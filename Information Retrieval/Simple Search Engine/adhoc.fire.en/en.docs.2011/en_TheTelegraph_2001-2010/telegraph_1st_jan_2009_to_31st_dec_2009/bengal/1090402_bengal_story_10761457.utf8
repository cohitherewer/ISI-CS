                                                                                                               Trio with arms for Lalgarh caught
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Midnapore, April 1: Three men were arrested last night with a cache of Bihar-made arms allegedly meant for Maoists camping in West Midnapores Lalgarh.        
	The trios Ambassador was stopped around Tuesday-Wednesday midnight for checks 10km before Lalgarh, where a tribal group has been leading a campaign to keep out police.        
	One of them is a suspected Maoist action squad member. Another is out on bail in a case related to the murder of two activists of the CPM youth wing last February.        
	Bikash Mahato, 30, the alleged Maoist, is a resident of Kantapahari in Lalgarh. Ainul Haque, 37, is from Singhpara in nearby Binpur. The third, driver Safiur Rahman, 53, hails from Bihar, the police said.         
	Three pipe guns, parts of improvised rifles, 30 rounds of ammunition and Maoist leaflets  some of them calling for a boycott of the polls  were said to have been found.         
	They were also carrying pamphlets asking people to build an armed struggle against the police and the ruling party (the CPM), an officer said.        
	The arrests come at a time Lalgarh tribals, led by the Peoples Committee Against Police Atrocities, have decided to resist the entry of security forces for the elections. The committee is believed to be backed by Maoists.        
	The trio told us they had collected the arms from Bihars Munger (infamous for illegal arms factories) for the Maoists in Lalgarh, said district police chief Manoj Verma.         
	Bikash, suspected to be a member of the Maoist action squad, was showing the driver the way, Verma added.         
	Bihar police have been requested to provide information on Safiur.         
	A Midnapore court today remanded the trio in police custody for 12 days.        
	The arms haul has fuelled apprehensions about a possible Maoists offensive in Lalgarh if security forces try to break through the tribal resistance before the polls. About 50 Maoist guerrillas have set up camps in the forests there, an officer said.        
	In Calcutta, home secretary Ardhendu Sen admitted the police were finding it difficult to enter the core area of Lalgarh, but said they were getting into some parts.         
	Lalgarh murder        
	A Peoples Committee member missing from Lalgarh since Sunday was found dead today. Indrajit Sahis, 21, was lying dead on the banks of Kangsabati, 3km from his village. The committee alleged that CPM goons had kidnapped him.

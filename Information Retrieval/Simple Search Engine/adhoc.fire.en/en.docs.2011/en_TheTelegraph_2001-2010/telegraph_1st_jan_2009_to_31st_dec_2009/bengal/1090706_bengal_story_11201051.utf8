                                                                                                               Work resumes at Haldia
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Tamluk, July 5: Nearly 4,000 labourers who had partially stalled work at Haldia port to press for increased wages resumed duties today expressing the hope that talks now under way would be fruitful.        
	The Citu supporters, engaged by contractors for the loading and unloading operations of export-import firms, had been blocking an approach road to the port since Tuesday.         
	Citu leaders said the agitation was withdrawn following a request from district magistrate C.D. Lama at a meeting. Our labourers have withdrawn the agitation because talks to find a solution have started. We are hopeful about their outcome, said Lakshman Seth, East Midnapore Citu chief.        
	People who now get about Rs 100 a day are demanding a hike of 150 to 200 per cent.        
	One of the agitators said they would resume their blockade if a solution wasnt found within a fortnight.

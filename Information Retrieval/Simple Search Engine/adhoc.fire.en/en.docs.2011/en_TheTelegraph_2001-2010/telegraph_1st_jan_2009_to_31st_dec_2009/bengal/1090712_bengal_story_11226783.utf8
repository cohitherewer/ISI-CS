The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | GNLF arrest to calm hills
                                                                                                               GNLF arrest to calm hills
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                               
	Darjeeling, July 11: The Darjeeling district administration has arrested the GNLFs Terai region leader, Rajen Mukhia, fulfilling one demand of the Gorkha Janmukti Morcha that has threatened an indefinite strike in the hills from Monday.        
	Two of Mukhias associates were arrested last night too.         
	The Morcha, which told schools in the hills to send boarders home, has also demanded the transfer of K.L. Tamta, the inspector-general (north Bengal), and two other police officers.         
	Yesterday, the police lathicharged Morcha supporters at Panighata for attacking Mukhias home. The Morcha announced the strike after that.        
	Reacting to the arrests, Morcha assistant secretary Binay Tamang said: We filed a complaint against 35 GNLF supporters and only three were arrested. This is a police ruse to provide them protection.        
	The schools in the hills are waiting for the Morcha to review its strike plan. Over 5,000 students will have to leave the hills within the next 48 hours  a task that seems impossible for the schools.        
	Father Kinley Tshering, rector of St Josephs School (North Point) and head of the Anglo-Indian schools of the hills, appealed to the Morcha leadership to review their announcement. But the Morcha has not reacted to the appeal.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Relief piles up but few to ferry it   Four boats for marooned lakhs

	Sunderbans, May 31: There are heaps of relief goods lying in a camp in Godkhali ghat but before this morning there were just four launches to take them to Sunderbans villages.        
	Although 25 lakh people are marooned on the 52 inhabited islands, the administration thought the four government boats would be enough to distribute the tarpaulin sheets, food and water.        
	Initially we thought we would be able to distribute the material with these four launches, said Amiya Bhushan Chakraborty, the Gosaba block development officer who was beaten up today by angry residents on the island of Bali.        
	Today, six days after the cyclone struck, private boats were mobilised to ferry the relief material.        
	Had they requisitioned the private launches and mechanised boats from the first day, the operation would have been smoother, said an army officer, who did not want to be named.        
	But the district administration perhaps does not need the armys assistance either. It has withdrawn the sixth engineering regiment of the Indian Army that was deployed for the first two days after Aila wreaked havoc last Monday. We could have helped the administration in building roads and embankments and would have helped in relief operations, said the army officer.         
	Finance minister Asim Dasgupta today admitted that relief work had been slow to take off. The problem is with the distribution after the material reaches the district. From the state government to the district (the going) is fine. At the district to block level, we are keeping track of the figures..... There are problems, he said at Writers Buildings.        
	People are not getting food in the villages whereas here things are getting wasted, said Bibhuti Gayen from Sajnekhali, who waited for food for three days, then got fed up and came to the relief camp with his family.         
	After spending Rs 30 to reach the relief centre, his family of three got a few water pouches, some puffed rice and jaggery from a makeshift office at Godkhali, where the launches are loaded with relief goods.         
	We spent sleepless nights waiting for the relief to reach us but got nothing. We couldnt wait any more. We have almost nothing to eat in our village. There was no drinking water, said Gayen, standing in a queue with about 100 people at Godkhali, around 120km from Calcutta.         
	Anil Kumar Shaw, from the Bali 1 gram panchayat area, said: I travelled for over three hours to collect some relief material. I have to rush back as my son has diarrhoea. There are still no health care camps in the villages, he added.        
	We can reach here but it seems the government, with all its resources, cant reach us, one villager said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Job scandal hits CPM in Burdwan 
                                                                                                               Job scandal hits CPM in Burdwan 
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Durgapur, Aug. 6: The CPM today expelled 17 party members in Burdwans Pandaveswar block for misappropriating public funds running into lakhs meant for the National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme.         
	Those axed include four CPM branch committee secretaries and two local committee members of Pandaveswar. The local committee in in the block has been dissolved.         
	The CPMs Burdwan district leadership has formed a seven-member panel to oversee party work following the dissolution of the local committee.        
	The district unit cracked its whip after complaints from CPM supporters in Pandaveswar block who did not get wages under the central scheme for the last nine months.         
	An official of the Burdwan district administration, which has also started a probe, said: We found that payments were made to a number of persons who didnt work under the scheme at all and those who had actually worked did not get their money. This is clear misappropriation and misuse of central funds.         
	The money misappropriated is believed to be around Rs 20 lakh, but the exact figure will become clear after probes being conducted by the party and district authorities.        
	CPM insiders said such stern disciplinary action against so many party workers was rare and unheard of in the recent past.        
	Pandaveswar is a CPM stronghold and the partys Burdwan district unit the strongest in the state.        
	Bengal has a dismal rural job scheme record. The state is one of the worst performers, having managed to give only 12 days work against the national average of 32 days.         
	In Pandaveswar last week, over 1,000 CPM supporters, armed with axes, crowbars and shovels, ransacked the houses of the party leaders and beat them up.         
	The scared leaders fled their homes. Many are yet to return.        
	The district unit has set up a five-member committee to investigate if more party functionaries were involved.         
	The committee will submit its report by the end of this month and further action will follow on the basis of its findings. We never allow corrupt persons in our party. During our preliminary investigation, we found that 17 party members and five auxiliary members in Pandaveswar guilty, said Amal Halder, the district secretary. All the 17 primary members have been expelled. No decision has been taken on the five auxiliary members, a CPM source said.        
	Among the 17 are two former gram panchayat chiefs, Bhagabat Ruidas and Ardhya Chandra Ruidas, panchayat member Rabin Ruidas and two panchayat samiti functionaries, Prabir Ruidas and Sarbadeb Ram.         
	After the beatings at the hands of villagers on August 2, panchayat chiefs Bhagabat Ruidas and Ardhya Chandra Ruidas had fled. They returned to their villages the next day and resigned from their panchayat posts and fled again.        
	The CPM supporters want immediate payment of their wages and punishment to the corrupt leaders.         
	An FIR has not been lodged yet. The district police said they would start their own inquiry after lodging an FIR in a day or two.        
	Burdwan district magistrate Rajesh Kumar Sinha said action would be taken against those involved in the scam. We are also going to take appropriate legal action against all the accused. Some clerical staff in some panchayats were also involved in the misappropriation of central funds, he said.

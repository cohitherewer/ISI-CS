                                                                                                               Funds ready, but no nod to river work yet

	Malda, Jan. 1: The state irrigation department in Malda is awaiting permission from the Ganga Flood Control Commission to begin a Rs 33 crore anti-erosion work along the river in the border areas.        
	We can begin the work the moment we get the go-ahead from the commission, said Soumen Mishra, the executive engineer of the department.        
	According to him, the Centre is going to bear 75 per cent of the project cost, while the state government will spend 25 per cent. There will be an eight-km long concrete embankment on the Mahananda from Muchia to Hrishipur with boulder pitching.        
	The work order will be issued the moment the green signal arrives from the commission. We want to begin the work by February so that we can complete the project before the monsoon.        
	District magistrate Sridhar Ghosh said the anti-erosion work and border security were inter-linked. Quoting a survey report, he said the Mahananda had devoured a huge amount of Indian land in Habibpur. The militant organisations have been taking advantages of the situation. They are reaching the Indian territory through this route.        
	Guarding the border has become difficult in the area because of heavy erosion, a BSF spokesperson said and added that the river has come very close to the barbed-wire fence and the border road at Muchia and Adampur in Habibpur.

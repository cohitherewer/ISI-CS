The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Deepa goes after Mamata
                                                                                                               Deepa goes after Mamata
          OUR BUREAU                          Deepa Das Munshi at Hazra on Saturday. (Bishwarup Dutta)                                  
	Jan. 24: Congress MLA Deepa Das Munshi held a rally on Mamata Banerjees home turf and accused her of trying to split the party on a day the Trinamul Congress leader iterated her desire for an alliance of Opposition parties.        
	People dont approve of Mamatas double standards. On the one hand she is splitting our party and spitting venom on us and, on the other, she is advocating an alliance. How will she make overtures to Sonia Gandhi while keeping her relations with L.K. Advani intact? Deepa asked a gathering at Gol Park.        
	The state Congress general secretary, wife of Priya Ranjan Das Munshi, marched with her supporters from Hazra  a stones throw from the Trinamul leaders Harish Chatterjee Street house  to Gol Park via Kalighat, Rash Behari, and Gariahat, the heart of Mamatas constituency.         
	In Bolpur, about 190km from Calcutta, Mamata stressed the need for a Congress-Trinamul deal. The CPM wants to foil our possible alliance so that it can cash in on the division of Opposition votes, she said, adding: Common people, from peasants to teachers to labourers, want us to get united to oust the communists.        
	She went on to remind party workers that I was in the Congress and the late Rajiv Gandhi was my leader.         
	A Trinamul leader explained the sudden remembering of Mamatas days in the Congress. Didi wanted to send a message to Congress chief Sonia Gandhi: that she is still a Congress person in heart and wants a tie-up with her party.         
	The Trinamul brass had yesterday said the party was still part of the BJP-led NDA. That alliance has stood in the way of a formal tie-up with the Congress in the past.        
	Congress leader Subrata Mukherjee, who skipped Deepas rally today though it was held very close to his home, said: I dont know why south Calcutta was chosen for a rally against terror strikes.         
	Sources said Mukherjees group stayed away because of a grudge against Das Munshi, who was the state party president when he had to be hospitalised last September.         
	Subratada didnt like the way boudi (Deepa) was interfering in every organisational matter in Priyadas absence, a state Congress leader said.

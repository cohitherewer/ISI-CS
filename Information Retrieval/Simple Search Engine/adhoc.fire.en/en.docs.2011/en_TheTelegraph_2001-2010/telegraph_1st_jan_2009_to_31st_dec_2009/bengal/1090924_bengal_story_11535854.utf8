          OUR CORRESPONDENT                      Trinamul supporters take Pradhans wife away on a motorbike. (Rajib Chakraborty)                          
	Nandigram, Sept. 23: About 500 Trinamul Congress supporters today dragged a CPM loyalists wife to a panchayat pradhan in Sonachura on the suspicion that she had given shelter to some men who killed a Trinamul leader yesterday.        
	Unidentified assailants shot dead 55-year-old Nishikanta Mondal near his home in Sonachura last evening.        
	Today around 7am, villagers landed at the door of Surjya Deb Pradhans house, which is barely 100m from the murder spot. Pradhan, a 38-year-old CPM supporter, had fled home after the partys drubbing in the Lok Sabha polls.         
	When the mob surrounded the house and later barged in, Pradhans wife and eight-year-old daughter were present.        
	The Trinamul supporters claimed they found beds made for three people on the loft in Pradhans house, shirts and trousers and several bottles of liquor lying around.         
	Some Trinamul supporters also claimed that the villagers found an empty magazine for .303 bullets in a bush near the house.         
	Women in the crowd immediately accused Pradhans wife of giving shelter to Mondals killers and were about to thrash her but were restrained by local Trinamul leaders.        
	Soon, the villagers started grilling the woman. When she stayed mum, they asked her daughter if anybody else had stayed in the house in the last few days.        
	The frightened girl told the villagers that three men had come to stay in their house a few times.         
	The girl told us about the three men. We were furious and knew that the plot to kill Nishikanta Mondal was hatched in that house, said farmer Bimal Krishna Mondol.        
	The villagers dragged Pradhans wife to a motorcycle and two of them took her to the house of the pradhan of Kalicharanpur gram panchayat, Sheikh Sahabuddin.        
	Another round of grilling followed, though it is not clear if the woman confessed anything.         
	By 1pm, police came to know that a CPM supporters wife had been taken away by a Trinamul mob. They went to Sheikh Sahabuddins home and took Pradhans wife to Nandigram police station.        
	We questioned her in the police station and she confessed giving shelter to four men who knew her husband. Of the four, two were from Nandigram but the others were outsiders. She told us that she allowed them to stay only because her husband knew them, said a police officer.        
	District superintendent of police B. Baidya, however, refused to disclose the outcome of the interrogation. We are still interrogating her and we cant divulge anything for the sake of investigation, the officer said.        
	Late tonight, the woman was arrested. The police also detained two CPM workers  Basudeb Mondol of Nandigram and Bhim Patra of Khejuri. They were arrested later.        
	The CPM district leadership admitted that Pradhan was a party supporter. Pradhan is our supporter. He fled home as Trinamul workers let loose a reign of terror in Nandigram. Trinamul workers created pressure on Pradhans wife and forced her to give a false statement, said Ashok Guria, the district secretariat member of CPM.         
	A post-mortem was carried out on Nishikantas body today at Tamluk district hospital and was taken to his house in Sonachura by party workers and leaders, including Union minister Mukul Roy, and Tamluk MP Subhendu Adhikary around 2pm.        
	Nishikantas younger daughter, 25-year-old Sanchita said her father had gone to the panchayat office for some work yesterday morning and returned home after 5pm.        
	When he sat down to eat, he kept getting phone calls from people he did not know. They asked him to go to Sonachura market. My father could only eat half the food and left on his motorcycle for Sonachura market, said Sanchita.        
	Sanchita said the last call Nishikanta received was from a relative in Chandrakona, West Midnapore. The last call on my fathers mobile was from my uncle, who called us up and alerted us saying something seemed to have gone wrong, she added.

                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      Buddha complaint to PM
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	New Delhi, Dec. 26: Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee today discussed with Prime Minister Manmohan Singh the states law and order and the unrest in the hills.        
	Here to attend the CPM politburo meeting, the chief minister called on Singh this morning and apparently complained about how CPM supporters were being targeted by Trinamul Congress goons and Maoist guerrillas.        
	He had earlier alleged a nexus between the two, though the Union home minister had ruled that out.        
	Sources said Bhattacharjee wanted to meet the home minister but P. Chidambaram was in Chennai. They might meet tomorrow.        
	The home ministry had recently written to the state government on the need to curb political violence. The letter had been sent after a three-member central team went to Calcutta and spoke to representatives of various political parties and state officials. The state, however, has denied receiving the letter.        
	The chief minister also iterated his governments stand on the demand for Gorkhaland, saying a separate state would be unviable and talks were the only way forward.        
	The assertion comes against the backdrop of the Centres announcement of a possible second states reorganisation commission.         
	Later in the day, Bhattacharjee called on finance minister Pranab Mukherjee. They discussed the need to push ahead some of the pending central projects in the state.

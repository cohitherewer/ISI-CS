The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Held up: exam result 
                                                                                                               Held up: exam result

	Calcutta, June 1: Relief isnt the only thing that hasnt reached the cyclone-ravaged Sunderbans since Aila struck. Priyanka Sarkars Madhyamik result has been held up, too.         
	I have reached Calcutta but my exam result (declared on Thursday) hasnt reached my village school, the 16-year-old resident of Gosaba block said today.        
	Priyanka and her family have been staying with her uncle in Garia since fleeing their devastated village, Number 7 Lux Bagan, on Saturday.         
	A teacher told me before I came to the city that only one candidate from our school had probably failed to clear the exam. I am confident that person isnt me, but seeing is believing, Priyanka said.        
	Central Satjelia MC High School, where Priyanka studied, and her home are the only two concrete buildings in Lux Bagan. They are also the only two structures in the village, on the eastern fringes of Satjelia island, to have survived the storm.

                                                                                                               Maoist first rally
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Midnapore, May 31: The CPI (Maoist) held its first rally in the state in West Midnapores Lalgarh this evening.         
	The Peoples War Group and the MCC had merged to form the CPI(Maoist) in 2004. Since then, the Maoists have never gathered under their own flag for a meeting.        
	Nearly 200 armed activists of the CPI (Maoist), which is not banned in Bengal unlike in Andhra Pradesh and Orissa, gathered in Lalgarh, an area where tribals with Maoist help have blocked out police. Around 6,000 villagers from Lalgarh and its neighbourhood attended the meeting.         
	The Maoists announced a 24-hour Bharat bandh tomorrow to protest the killing of Patel Sudhakar Reddy, an accused in the assassination bid on former Andhra chief minister Chandrababu Naidu in 2003. Reddy was shot dead in Warangal.

                                                                                                               Left pushes back debacle analysis     Three-round scrutiny to kill the heat
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                          Bengal MPs  (from left) Tarun Mondal, Saugata Roy, Somen Mitra, CM Jatua, Kakoli Ghosh Dastidar, Gobinda Naskar, Sultan Ahmed and Sudip Bandopadhyay  come out of Parliament with their new briefcases on Thursday. (Rajesh Kumar)                                        
	Calcutta, May 21: The Left today postponed its first discussion on the fronts poll debacle because the CPM wants to put its house in order before facing the allies flak.         
	While chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee spoke little at the cabinet meeting in the morning and the Left Front huddle in the evening, CPM state secretary Biman Bose set the tone for a long three-tier process of introspection that lay ahead of all Front constituents.        
	Bose said instead of all Left parties gathering for a discussion, it would be better for all the partners to form their own understanding first on what went wrong.        
	So, each Left constituent will have its own huddle first, followed by what Bose called bilateral meetings  between the CPM and other front partners by turns.         
	We will hold bilateral meetings and the common findings would be put forward in the full Left Front meeting later, he said.        
	The three rounds of meetings would probably take the steam out of the angry rank and file by the time the process of introspection gets over.        
	Bose said the government and its ministers should pull up their socks and ensure speedy implementation of schemes for the common man before the 2011 Assembly elections.         
	But before taking on a united Congress-Trinamul Congress opposition in the Assembly elections, there are elections to 19 municipal areas on June 28.         
	Also, by-elections will be held for 526 panchayat seats as well as for the Siliguri subdivisional parishad.        
	The CPM, which is divided on what national and state-specific factors led to its poor showing  some leaders blame Prakash Karats misplaced third front ambitions, others say Singur-Nandigram and minority discontent played a big role  will meet on Sunday for its first review.         
	Bose today said the Left Front got 43.30 per cent of the votes while the Trinamul-Congress combine got 45.67 per cent. This makes it clear that a large number of people supported us even in this situation, he said.         
	The Fronts own figures claim that in last years panchayat elections and in the 2006 Assembly polls, the Left got over 50 per cent of the total votes. Comparing the Lok Sabha percentage of 43.30 would show a nearly 7 per cent loss in votes.        
	At the Left meeting at Alimuddin Street, Kshiti Goswami, the RSP leader and PWD minister, tried to needle the chief minister by asking the front to take a clear stand on media reports about Bhattacharjees personal responsibility in the election setback. Forward Bloc vete-ran Ashok Ghosh, however, cut him short, saying there was no need for a discussion on this.         
	The chief minister focused on coordinated work by government departments and spoke on post-poll violence, but did not utter a word on the elections. Once out of the meetings, he became mum.        
	Bose said the party cadres had accepted the results and violence should stop now. He urged the allies to make a concerted effort to bring back those who had deserted the Left. The ally ministers, however, complained that they were insulted nowadays by panchayat leaders.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Starved, cops leave Salboni
                                                                                                               Starved, cops leave Salboni
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                          Jawans leave the camp on foot. Telegraph picture                                  
	Midnapore, April 27: A camp in Salboni used to patrol parts of restive Lalgarh had to be shut down today after tribals pushed the 90 policemen housed there to near starvation, preventing them from buying provisions for days on end.        
	West Midnapore superintendent of police Manoj Verma said the Kalaimuri camp was wound up as the personnel didnt want any confrontation.        
	Another officer said the move would give Maoists, suspected to be guiding the resistance to the police, a free run.        
	The camps withdrawal comes days after the administration virtually relinquished control of a large swathe of Lalgarh and agreed to hold the April 30 polls in four designated places, instead of 40.        
	The force at the Kalaimuri camp used to patrol 35sqkm covering 22 villages in Lalgarh, Salboni and Goaltore. The Maoists will now move freely in the area. The rebels might also take over the camp, Verma said.        
	However, home secretary Ardhendu Sen seemed to suggest in Calcutta that the cops were being moved for election duty. It is true they ran out of rations. But they are also needed for the polls, he said.        
	Sen did not clarify why the personnel would move out with all their belongings for election duty.        
	A dozen vehicles came to take the policemen and their stuff. However, the personnel walked 10km in the scorching sun to Goaltore instead of taking a bus fearing an ambush.        
	The district police chief said the police were not only being prevented from shopping in the local bazaar but also from getting supplies from, say, Goaltore.         
	Sidhu Soren of the Peoples Committee Against Police Atrocities said his outfit would seize the single-storey house built for the security forces. This is our victory. Weve been demanding the camps closure for long. We will set up a health centre in the building.

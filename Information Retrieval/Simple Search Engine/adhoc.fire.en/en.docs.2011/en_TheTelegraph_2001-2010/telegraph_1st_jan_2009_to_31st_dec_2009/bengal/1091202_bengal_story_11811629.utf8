                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      CM meet eludes US chamber
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Calcutta, Dec. 1: The Calcutta chapter of the American Chamber of Commerce (Amcham) waited for close to two months to meet Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee with a document outlining its aspirations and concerns but did not get a call from the chief ministers office.        
	The chamber, which rep-resents the interest of American companies in Bengal, said the paper was a documentation of a panel discussion it had organised in July with Trinamuls Partha Chatter- jee, the CPMs Shamik Lahiri and officials of a host of companies such as PepsiCo, Ford and GE.        
	The chamber had sought the appointment with the chief minister in September. Not getting any response in about eight weeks, it handed over the document to industries minister Nirupam Sen in the third week of November.        
	We sought the CMs time but did not get it, said Amchams Calcutta chapter chairman Aniruddha Lahiri.        
	Sources said the chief ministers office did not turn down Amchams request but kept deferring the meeting.        
	Bhattacharjee had always been open to US investments, taking on his partys anti-US stands at times.        
	Participants in the panel discussion had raised the issue, saying the Left Front government was difficult to understand at times and suggested the state show its commitment to free market. They had also spoken on the need for political consensus to ensure industrial development.        
	There is optimism all around but there are concerns among investors sitting far away. We wanted to build the bridge between the investors and the state, Lahiri said.        
	The chamber said a copy of the document was also given to Trinamuls Chatterjee, but no appointment had been sought with his boss Mamata Banerjee. If she asks, we will be very happy to meet her, Lahiri said, adding US companies were approaching her for railway projects.

	Calcutta, June 1: The government could call an all-party meeting to discuss distribution of relief, CPM state secretary Biman Bose said today but the Trinamul Congress pooh-poohed the effort.        
	The government might call an all-party meeting to discuss proper distribution of relief if it feels necessary. I can at best request the government to do so at this juncture, Bose said when asked if he was in favour of such a meeting.        
	Several Left partners pledged support for the move.        
	Trinamul state chief Subrata Bakshi said: The CPM is being partisan while distributing relief... an all-party meeting will be of little help.         
	Mamata Banerjee slammed the state government again for not sending relief to the marooned across the Sunderbans. Fed up with their delay, I have arranged for bottles of drinking water, baby food, medicines and tarpaulin sheets from the railways, she said.        
	The Congresss Manas Bhuniya, too, said the all-party meeting would be useless.         
	Bose regretted that the Opposition was playing politics over relief for the cyclone-hit. Ive been associated with relief work since 1958 but never seen such petty politics over a humanitarian crisis.

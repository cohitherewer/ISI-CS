The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Mangalkot justifies attack on MLAs
                                                                                                               Mangalkot justifies attack on MLAs
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                          A villager cries on the local CPM MLAs shoulder. (Arup Sengupta)                                  
	Mangalkot, July 24: Scores of women today broke down in front of visiting Left legislators in Mangalkot and said their men had stoned the Congress delegation last week because it was accompanied by those behind a popular CPM leaders murder.        
	We want the immediate arrest of those who killed Falgunida (Falguni Mukherjee). He was such a good man, sobbed Jharna Pradhan, 47, housewife of a family of CPM supporters at Kherua village.        
	The villagers accused the police of dragging their feet on the murder probe.         
	A resident of Dhanyarukhi village, where the Congress team was chased across paddy fields and assaulted, Mukherjee was known to lend his hand to villagers in distress.         
	During the floods of 2006, Falgunida had worked like a labourer to repair the embankments of the Ajoy, said Sudarshan Mondal of neighbouring Lakshmipur.         
	The villagers had apparently pleaded in vain with the police accompanying the Congress MLAs to arrest the murder accused with them. Four of them were there. We shouted at the police pointing them out but they refused to listen to us. We lost our composure after that and started hurling stones, said Jharna Majhi.        
	The villagers identified the four as Biswajit Ghosh, Bhetu Chattoraj, Nazir Sheikh and Nilu Ghosh.         
	The police, who had earlier denied the presence of any of the murder accused among the Congress leaders, today said they are not sure. We are investigating the allegation, said a senior Katwa officer.        
	The Congress has accused the CPM of launching a planned assault and forced a bandh on Bengal on July 17.        
	But the outpouring of grief for gharer chheley (boy next door) Mukherjee was a common factor in all the villages where the Left leaders went today. Two CPM MPs, five party MLAs and one from the Forward Bloc also spoke to party supporters about restoration of peace in the area, rocked by clashes since the murder.        
	The Congress MLA from neighbouring Katwa, who was among those injured last week, said todays visit was likely to foment more trouble. Emboldened by it, their supporters will again attack our men and burn their houses.        
	Additional superintendent of police Humayun Kabir denied any laxity in the murder probe. We have arrested four and are looking for another 10. They are absconding.

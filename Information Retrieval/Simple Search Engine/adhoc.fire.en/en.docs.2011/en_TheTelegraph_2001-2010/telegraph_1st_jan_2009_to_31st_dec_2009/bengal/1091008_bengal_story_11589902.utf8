                                                                                                               Flak for city artistes
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Calcutta, Oct. 7: Anti-Maoist Naxalites and Jharkhand outfits today condemned the rebels and the government for unleashing a terror competition in Lalgarh and the rest of the tribal hinterland.         
	The Jharkhand Andolan Samanaya Manch opposed the arrest of Chhatradhar Mahato and Maoist sympathisers under the Unlawful Activities Prevention Act at a news conference in the city. It urged the CPI (Maoist) and the government to sit for talks to find a non-military solution.         
	The Maoists challenged the CPM hegemony only to impose their own by killing the leaders and supporters of other parties, said Babu Bose, a Manch leader.         
	The good relations between the Jharkhand groups active in Bengal and the Maoists during the panchayat polls last year soured before the Lok Sabha elections in May after killings on both sides.         
	The Manch spoke out against Mahatos mode of agitation  digging up roads in Lalgarh  and slammed artistes and writers supporting him. The learned people who went there to talk to Mahato should have criticised the disruptive tactics. What would have they done had Calcuttas entry and exit point been blocked for months? CPI(ML) leader Santosh Rana asked. He also said it was the CPM that had befriended the Maoists in 1998 to dislodge the Trinamul-BJP from Garbeta-Keshpur.

	Salboni, Sept. 2: Security forces tonight had a trophy to show for the first time since operation Lalgarh began in June: the bodies of two Maoists shot dead in a Salboni forest.        
	After an eight-hour gun battle during which the reb- els were sucked into a trap, the forces also claimed to have caught a Maoist duo, though no arms were found on them.         
	Three single-barrel guns and 17 rounds of ammunition were found near the slain men in the rain-soaked Memul forest, 10km from Lalgarh town.         
	Scores of encounters have taken place since June with the police claiming to have gunned down several Maoists, but none of the bodies could be traced.         
	Today, the police said at least 10 Maoists took bullets, but their comrades managed to drag them away.        
	Over the past few days, the forces had reports of a guerrilla build-up in the cluster of villages on the edge of the forest. The decision to move in was taken on Monday.        
	At 11am today, three groups comprising 300 jawans drawn from the CRPF, its Cobra unit and the state armed police set out for the forest from Goaltore, Pirakata and Salboni town.                     
	Around 11.30, the team from Salboni faced gunfire. During the encounter that ensued, the jawans kept retreating towards a paddy field behind them, drawing the Maoists towards the open.         
	We beat a planned retreat. The Maoists thought they were chasing us, said a CRPF officer.         
	There were about 100 gunmen in the forest. By the time they neared the field, the two other groups of security forces had closed in on them without firing a single shot.         
	Unaware of their presence, about 20 Maoists stepped out of the cover and kept moving towards the retreating cops, who had by then taken shelter in the knee-deep waters of a canal. The only people without cover were the Maoists.        
	The police on either side of the field then opened fire along with those in the canal.         
	The Maoists tried to flee back into the forest and we chased them, firing all the while, said West Midnapore police chief Manoj Verma.         
	The encounter ended around 7pm with most of the Maoists slipping into an adjoining forest.        
	We found the bodies on the edge of the forest, said Verma.        
	The police identified one of the two killed as Haradhan Mahato but did not say which rung of the Maoist squad he belonged to.         
	Late tonight, Peoples Committee Against Police Atrocities leader Chhatradhar Mahato said the arrested duo  Ajit Mana of Madhupur village, on the edge of Memul forest, and Gautam Mahato of Goaltore  were not guerrillas but supporters of his outfit.

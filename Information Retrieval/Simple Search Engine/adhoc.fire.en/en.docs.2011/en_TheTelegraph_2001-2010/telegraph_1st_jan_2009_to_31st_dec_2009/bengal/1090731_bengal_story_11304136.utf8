                                                                                                               HC cracks whip on lethal slap 
          OUR LEGAL REPORTER                              
	Calcutta, July 30: Calcutta High Court has told the parents of a girl who died after a teacher slapped her to start a case against the teacher under non-bailable sections and lodge a criminal case against police for filing milder charges.        
	Justice Sanjib Banerjee said the parents of Iftesham Chowdhury had the liberty to to start a case under Section 304 of IPC (culpable homicide not amounting to murder) against the accused teacher.         
	They may lodge a complaint against the police before the trial court saying they had tried to protect the teacher and the school by charging her under the milder Section 304 A of the IPC (death because of negligence), the judge said.        
	Section 304 A of the IPC is bailable section. The accused can be given a two-month prison term. But Section 304 is non-bailable under which the accused can be given life imprisonment.        
	The next date of hearing is September 16.         
	Chowdhury Mansur Rahman and Nazneen, the parents of eight-year-old Iftesham, had approached the high court on March 18 and sought a CBI probe into the girls death.         
	Hinting at collusion between the school authorities and the police, the parents sought to know why the accused yoga teacher, Anita Das, was booked under a bailable section, instead of being slapped with the more stringent charge of culpable homicide not amounting to murder (Section 304).         
	On November 27 last year, Das had slapped Iftesham so hard that her head rammed against a wall. Her parents said the girl was crying in pain but Das forced her to do yoga.

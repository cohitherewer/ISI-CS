The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Cong must to beat Left, says Mamata
                                                                                                               Cong must to beat Left, says Mamata
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                            Mamata and Kabir Suman, Trinamul rsquo;s Jadavpur candidate                                 
	Calcutta, March 8: Mamata Banerjee today stressed the need to stitch an alliance with the Congress to ensure the Lefts defeat in all 42 Lok Sabha seats in Bengal.        
	Over a week has passed since I discussed the seat-sharing deal with senior Congress leaders, but no response has come from them. I will have to wait for them to firm up the alliance because I strongly believe that an electoral tie-up with the Congress is necessary to ensure the Lefts defeat in all 42 seats, Mamata told a party workers meeting in her Calcutta South constituency.        
	The Trinamul Congress chief regretted that Congress leaders were complaining they were not offered winnable seats. We had offered 14 seats out of 42 to Congress, including six already represented by the party. But they are complaining about the quality of seats. Tell me if they ask for all winnable seats, who will take those seats where chances of victory are less? she asked.         
	Instead of grumbling over seats, they (Congress leaders) should start building contacts with people at the grassroots to win their confidence. That is the only way of having a smooth sail in those seats.        
	Congress leaders, however, argued that all the eight seats offered  apart from the six it held  were traditional Left bastions.         
	They were also not happy that four of the seats were reserved for the Scheduled Castes and Tribes. Jalpaiguri, Arambagh and Bishnupur are for SCs and Jhargram for STs. Purulia, Burdwan-Durgapur and Birbhum also have a large SC/ST population. We hardly have any organisation among SC/STs. Barring Malda North, all seats are unwinnable, state Congress working president Subrata Mukherjee said.        
	Mukherjee pointed out that Mamata had won from Jad-avpur against the CPMs Somnath Chatterjee in 1984 cashing in on the sympathy wave after Indira Gandhis assassination. Mamata is advising us to win the confidence of voters. But it is tall talk. I want to remind Mamata that she couldnt have won Jadavpur minus the sympathy wave.        
	Trinamul state president Subrata Bakshi said Mamata had considerably softened her stand to help the Congress. Now it is up to the Congress to take a decision.         
	At the party gathering, Mamata said she was ready to concede for the sake of the alliance one or two more seats than what was offered to the Congress earlier. I am looking forward to hearing from the Congress leadership. I have already done my bit.         
	Trinamul sources said Mamata was desperate to woo Muslim voters, a sizeable section of whom were still with the Congress. Didi may have snapped her ties with the BJP but many Muslims in rural Bengal still side with the Congress. Even in her own constituency, they form a major part of the new Calcutta Port Assembly segment, said a Trinamul general secretary.        
	Mamata announced singer Kabir Sumans candidature from Jadavpur. He was with us in Singur and Nandigram. Ive requested him to contest from Jadavpur, she said.        
	At the party gathering, the Trinamul chief also offered to forgo her seat to a party leader like Partha Chatterjee or Javed Khan so that she could devote time to the organisation. I have to arrange funds to run the organisation. Moreover, if I dont contest, I can campaign for candidates in all 42 seats, she said amid loud protests.        
	Didi, we shall not allow anyone else to contest for Calcutta South, the audience said in unison.

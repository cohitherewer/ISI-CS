	Siliguri, Feb. 23: Kotwali police have cracked the Mita Sahu murder case in 10 days  a record of its sort.         
	The police found that Dipa Mallick, an ICDS employee and a resident of Ashrampara in Siliguri, had murdered Mita, with whose husband she had a relationship.         
	Our officers, who investigated the murder case, have successfully identified the main culprit. Dipa, whom we arrested last week, has revealed during interrogation that she had murdered Mita Sahu on February 14 evening, K.L. Tamta, the inspector-general of police (north Bengal), said in Jalpaiguri today.         
	We will, however, carry out further investigation and try to obtain more evidence to substantiate the charges, the officer added.        
	Mita Sahu, a supervisor of the ICDS, used to stay with her daughter Diyashi at their house in Deshbandhupara, Jalpaiguri. Her husband Prasanta was an ICDS project officer and was posted in Darjeeling.         
	On February 14 evening, when Prasanta and Diyashi returned home after attending the latters music classes, they found Mita lying dead on the staircase of the second floor, with blood oozing out of her head which, police suspected, was hit by a blunt weapon.        
	In the course of the probe, the weapon, a hammer, was recovered. Also, we came to know that Prasanta had an extra-marital relationship with Dipa, a divorcee and an employee of the same department posted at Binnaguri in Jalpaiguri district.         
	She used to stay at Ashrampara and Prasanta would visit her frequently and even bear some of her household expenditure, an officer said.        
	As the police picked up Prasanta and grilled him, he started spilling beans on his dissipated life. Dipa was arrested and produced in a court which remanded her in police custody.        
	During the interrogation, Dipa confessed that she was desperate to marry Prasanta and had even plans to hire killers to murder Mita, the officer said. When quizzed further, she broke down and confessed the murder.        
	According to Tamta, Prasanta had been to Dipas house in Siliguri on February 13 when she insisted that he should marry her. The woman wanted to know why Prasanta was not maintaining a steady relationship. The next day, she reached Prasantas home around 7pm. As Prasanta and Diyashi were away, Mita was alone at home.        
	There might have been an altercation between Dipa and Mita, but we need to verify it. Dipa, all of a sudden, attacked Mita and hit her with the hammer, leaving her dead, said the officer. Then, Dipa came out, took a bus to Siliguri and reached her home.         
	The police are, however, yet to find out whether Prasantas absence was a part of any plot or Dipa had committed the murder in the heat of the moment.         
	We are also checking out call lists of the cell phones of Dipa and Prasanta, the two accused in the case, said Tamta.         
	The police did not, however, clarify whether additional charges would be brought against the duo. Prasanta has been charged for murder and Dipa has been booked for criminal conspiracy. Both of them would be produced in the chief judicial magistrates court on Wednesday.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | CPM leader shot
                                                                                                               CPM leader shot
                            
	Midnapore, Feb. 1: A CPM leader was shot dead by suspected Maoists this afternoon, barely 200 metres from his home in West Midnapores Lalgarh.        
	Nandalal Pal, 50, a member of the partys Binpur zonal committee, was a well-to-do farmer with over 1.5 acres.         
	Since his mothers death last week, Nandalals daily ritual used to be bathing in a canal and watering plants. As he stepped out of the water and turned towards home around noon, four men in shirts and trousers walked up to him and fired, said Subhendu Nandi, who was bathing in another part of the canal.        
	Nandalal was killed on the spot. We believe it was a Maoist job. But well also find out whether it was the result of a political or other feud, said district police chief Rajesh Kumar Singh.        
	After the assailants fled, villagers called up the police outpost at Ramgarh, 7km away. Police and CRPF personnel arrived at Murar village, about 225km from Calcutta, around 12.45pm.        
	The area had been wracked by a crippling tribal agitation against police atrocities last November and early December. The CPM, they had alleged, was hand in glove with the police.        
	The party has called a 12-hour Binpur-I block bandh tomorrow. Local leaders said the area had become a free zone for Maoists. They are threatening our people to quit the party. Nandalalbabu had also been threatened, said zonal committee secretary Anuj Pandey. Nandalal is survived by his wife, two married daughters and a son, a group D employee at Midnapore Medical College and Hospital.

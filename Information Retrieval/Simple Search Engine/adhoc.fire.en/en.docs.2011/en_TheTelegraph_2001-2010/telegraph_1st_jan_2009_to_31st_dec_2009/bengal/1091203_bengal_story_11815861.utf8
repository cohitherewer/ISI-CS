	New Delhi, Dec. 2 (PTI): Trinamul Congress minister Sultan Ahmed, who ran up a bill of Rs 37 lakh for staying in the five-star Hotel Ashok, has moved out after his party asked him to pay all the extra expenses from his pocket.         
	The Union minister of state for tourism said he had been allotted an official bungalow only a few days ago and was staying in the hotel as advised by officials. He was staying in a business suite comprising two rooms.

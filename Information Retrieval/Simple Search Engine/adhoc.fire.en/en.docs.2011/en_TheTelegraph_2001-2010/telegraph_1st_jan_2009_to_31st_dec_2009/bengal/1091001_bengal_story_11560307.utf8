   Party trio executed
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                            Anadi Mahato rsquo;s son Chiranjib and Bhakti Mahato rsquo;s widow Bharati. (Samir Mondal)                                 
	Salboni, Sept. 30: Maoists today executed three CPM supporters, delivering the verdicts of a kangaroo court to the victims homes and force-marching them to their deaths in a nearby forest in West Midnapore.        
	The three, dubbed police informers, were dragged away in front of their family members and at least one of the victim was tied up with his wifes sari before being shot behind the head.        
	About 50 armed guerrillas entered the houses of Anadi Mahato, 45, a member of Lalgeria Gram Panchayat, Bhakti Mahato, 38, and Radhanath Mahato, 42  all CPM supporters  and took them to the Abhoya forest near Ranja village.        
	The Maoists entered the village around 1.30am and first went to Anadis house. Anadis son, Chiranjib, a Madhyamik candidate, said he and his parents were sleeping when the Maoists started banging the main door.        
	We did not want to open the door. But they shouted that they would break the door, set fire to the house and burn us all alive. My father then opened the door and tried to escape. But the Maoists caught him and tied his hands behind his back, said Chiranjib.        
	The group then went to Bhaktis house, taking Anadi along. Bhakti and his wife Bharati had already woken up, hearing shouts outside.        
	We watched the Maoists through our window. They knocked on the door and my husband asked me to open it. As soon as I opened the door, Maoists caught my husband and tied him up. When I asked them why are you doing this to him? they told me that he had already been tried and a judgment had been delivered. The women in the squad pulled me away from my husband and they dragged him outside, said Bharati.        
	After this, the Maoists marched to Radhanaths house. Radhanath, his wife Bhabani and two sons  Babu, 12, and Bapi, 6  were sleeping when the Maoists kicked the door open and barged into the house. Then they dragged out my husband from the bed, said Bhabani.        
	Realising that the Maoists had come to kill her husband, Bhabani clutched him in a tight embrace and urged the rebels to spare him.        
	They told me that my husband had already been tried. They also told me that my husband would be released soon. They asked for a sari from me and tied up my husbands hands behind his back with it, said Bhabani.        
	Anadi, Bhakti and Radhanath were led to the Goaltore-Pirakata Road, 500 metres away, where they were asked to kneel down. Then each was shot behind their head from point-blank range.        
	Maoists have killed 47 people in West Midnapore, Bankura and Purulia since June 29.

          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Darjeeling, Sept. 6: The Gorkha Janmukti Morcha today said the state and the Centre should act instead of indulging in sweet talking and announced a slew of programmes to keep its demand for statehood on the boil.         
	Rallies were announced and wearing traditional Gorkha outfits made compulsory for hill people but there were no strike threats ahead of the tourist season. It is time for the state and the Centre to act instead of indulging in sweet talking. Dissolve the DGHC as promised and dump the Sixth Schedule bill officially. We want to see these things done, Morcha chief Bimal Gurung told a public meeting here.         
	Observers said the outfit wanted something to show its supporters before the next round of talks with the state and the Centre on December 21.

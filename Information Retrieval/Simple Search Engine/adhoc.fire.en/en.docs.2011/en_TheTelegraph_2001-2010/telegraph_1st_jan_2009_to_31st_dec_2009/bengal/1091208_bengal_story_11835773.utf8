The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Trinamul stalls Mitsubishi
                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      Trinamul stalls Mitsubishi
  - Opposition picks up Left baton in showpiece industry hub        OUR BUREAU                            Subhendu Adhikari and Lakshman Seth	                                      
	Dec. 7: Trinamuls Subhendu Adhikari has picked up at Mitsubishi PTA from where CPMs Lakshman Seth had left in Haldia Petrochemicals Ltd, driving a workers agitation in Bengals largest foreign direct investment destination demanding permanent jobs and wage hikes.        
	A union backed by Mamata Banerjees party blocked the Mitsubishi gates, disrupting work through the day and sending its Japanese management into a tizzy in a near re-run of the CPM labour arms agitation at HPL last month.         
	The power equation in the region has altered with Adhi-kari defeating Seth, once the undisputed leader of all trade unions in the port town, in the Lok Sabha elections.        
	The HPL shutdown was apparently Seths attempt to arrest the slide in his support because of the Trinamul foray. When it ended with the management agreeing to an over 100 per cent wage hike, industries in Haldia had expressed fear that the strike could again become a much-used tool to press for demands as in the 1960s and 70s.        
	The Trinamul union is doing exactly what Citu had done in HPL. The only difference is that the Left had made radical demands to retain its base among workers while here Trinamul is trying to gain control, an industry observer said.        
	At Mitsubishi, Trinamul wants permanent jobs for 150 casual workers and a raise for the rest. At HPL, Citu had sought a 300 per cent hike.         
	Mitsubishi has 513 permanent employees and around 600 casual staff.         
	The management declined comment, but sources said it was extremely concerned as the plant had had no labour unrest since it started operations earlier this decade.        
	Mitsubishi produces purified terephthalic acid (PTA), which goes into the making PET bottles and textiles.         
	Mitsubishi Corporation of Japan has invested $800 million or Rs 3,700 crore in the plant, whose capacity was tripled in October.        
	Around the same time, a Trinamul-backed contractors body got registered as a trade union in the factory. Adhikari, the local MP, is the president of Mitsubishis Nationalist Contractors Workers Union.        
	After the Lefts Lok Sabha debacle, a section of the workforce switched allegiance to the Trinamul union, which used the cry for regularisation of contract jobs to lure them.        
	This morning, the union laid siege to the factory gates and started demonstrating.         
	Work came to a near standstill as the agitation continued well into the evening.        
	The blockade was lifted following the managements written assurance to the Trinamul union late this evening to look into its demands.         
	Work resumed from the night shift.        
	General manager (human resource) Arunava Saha said: The workers were agitating in front of the factory gates. So, not a single employee could enter the premises. Around noon, some of the workers associated with the production division were allowed entry. Because of that, there was some work in the processing unit.         
	There was little or no work in the loading, unloading and despatch sections. There was no one to man the canteen and the guards, too, joined the ceasework, Saha said.         
	The Trinamul union may have run todays show, but Citu had also tried to throw its hat into the ring. Last week, Trinamul supporters had prevented its leaders Pranab Das and Biswanath Das from placing their charter of demands before the management.        
	The working president of the Trinamul union, Milon Mondal, said: For the past few years, we have been demanding that 150 casual workers be made permanent and the salaries of the rest be increased. The management had told us that they would make their decision known on December 5. But nothing of that sort happened. Thats why todays demonstration was held.        
	In Calcutta, Trinamuls trade union wing chief Purnendu Bose said Mamata was opposed to strikes in industrial units.         
	We will inquire into the causes behind todays agitation, Bose added.

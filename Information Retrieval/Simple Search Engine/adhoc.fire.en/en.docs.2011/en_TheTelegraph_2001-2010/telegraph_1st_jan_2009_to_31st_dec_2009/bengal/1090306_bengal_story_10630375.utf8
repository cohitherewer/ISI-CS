The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Krishnagar ice-breaker in the air
                                                                                                               Krishnagar ice-breaker in the air

	Calcutta, March 5: Hectic efforts over the last 24 hours seem to have brought the Congress-Trinamul Congress alliance talks on the track.        
	Reports suggested that Mamata has agreed to give the Krishnagar Lok Sabha seat to the Congress which wants to field Mahua Moitra, a former vice-president of financial services firm JP Morgan.        
	State Youth Congress president Amitava Chakraborty said tonight that he was camping in Delhi to request the high command to persuade Mamata to clear Moitras name.        
	Moitra has joined Rahuljis Aam Aadmi Ke Sipahi after chucking her job with placements in London and New York. Now she will make her debut in parliamentary politics if she is chosen the partys nominee for Krishnagar, he added.         
	Mamata herself was, however, silent on the Krishnagar seat. Things could change if the talks over other seats failed but leaders from both parties confirmed today that Krishnagar could go to Moitra.        
	Mamata had initially asked party MLA Tapas Pal to contest from Krishnagar. But she has changed her mind as Moitra is seen as close to Rahul Gandhi, said a key Trinamul leader.        
	Corroborating the Trinamul leaders observation, a PCC functionary now camping in Delhi said that AICC general secretary K. Keshava Rao had requested Mamata during the day to offer Krishnagar to the Congress.        
	Asked if he had spoken to Mamata, Rao said from Hyderabad tonight that he would not say a word about it. It is immaterial whether I had spoken to Mamataji or not. But this much I can tell you that a few hurdles over the alliance were cleared. We shall clinch the alliance within the next 48 hours, he said.        
	By referring to a few hurdles, AICC sources in Delhi said, Rao must have talked about the Krishnagar seat which was not given to the Congress when state unit president Pranab Mukherjee had called on Mamata on Sunday night.        
	Mamata today appeared optimistic about the proposed alliance with the Congress. Both Pranabda and I had agreed that Trinamul would put up candidates for 28 seats out of the 42 seats, while 14 would go to the Congress. Pranabda told me that he would let me know within two days after we had met here on Sunday. No matter whether it is two or four days, I can wait she said this afternoon.         
	Mukherjee told three state Congress leaders  Subrata Mukherjee, Pradip Bhattacharya and Manas Bhuniya  to accept the eight seats Mamata had already offered the party when they had called on him in Delhi tonight.        
	Sonia Gandhis political secretary Ahmed Patel is also learnt to have told the three not to grumble over the seats already offered.        
	Deepa Das Munshi, the Congress MLA from Raiganj, today met Sonia to request her that the alliance be worked out safeguarding the partys image.

          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Calcutta, March 5: Forty-eight Birbhum youths have alleged they were interviewed by two men claiming to be head-hunters for a prominent telecom company but were misled.        
	The youths from Suri filed a complaint of cheating against Anirban Mishra and Priyanath Chatterjee tonight at Bidhangar (south) police station saying the duo had interviewed them but rejected most in the group. The few selected were asked to join a smaller firm. Head-hunters are usually paid by the firms they hire for.        
	North 24-Parganas police chief Supratim Sarkar said: We are examining documents to ascertain what happened with these young people.

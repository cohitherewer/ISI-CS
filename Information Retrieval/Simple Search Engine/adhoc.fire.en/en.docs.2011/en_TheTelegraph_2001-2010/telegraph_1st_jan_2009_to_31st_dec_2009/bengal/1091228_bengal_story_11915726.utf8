	Dec. 27: A man who had got down from a bus to buy cake for his daughter was shot at in Bankura this morning.         
	As the bleeding man hobbled back into the bus for cover, the assailant followed and shot at him again but hit his wife who had jumped to his rescue.        
	Police are not sure if it was a Maoist strike because the guerrillas usually hunt in packs, but the needle of suspicion points to them because Subal Mondal, 35, was a member of a CPM-backed resistance group.        
	The lone attacker fled after the second shot as the packed bus became alarmed.        
	Mondal is in hospital with a bullet wound in his shoulder. His wife Mithu was hit in her arm. Residents of Belpahari, West Midnapore, they were going to a relative in Garbeta.        
	Bankura police chief Vishal Garg said guards had been posted at the hospital to protect the couple.        
	A group of 100 suspected Maoists entered the forest beat office in the Sarenga area of the district last night and set fire to furniture and files.         
	Two men from Birbhum were held in a West Midnapore forest today with 25 detonators and 80 bullets. Sheikh Anwar and Mohammad Khalek are suspected arms suppliers.

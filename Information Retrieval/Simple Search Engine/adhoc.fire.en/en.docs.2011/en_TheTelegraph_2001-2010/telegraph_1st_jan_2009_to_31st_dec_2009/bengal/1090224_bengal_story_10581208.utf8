The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Morcha blamed for stalled projects
                                                                                                               Morcha blamed for stalled projects
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Siliguri, Feb. 23: Bengal minister for power Mrinal Banerjee said today that the ongoing movement of the Gorkha Janmukti Morcha had halted a number of electricity projects, particularly the one to light up hill villages.         
	Rural electrification work could not be initiated in the three hill subdivisions of Darjeeling because of the ongoing movement, said Banerjee, who was on a visit here. While work is going on in the Siliguri subdivision, where we are spending Rs 22 crore for the project, Rs 55 crore, earmarked for the hills, is lying unutilised. Our department invited tenders from contractors twice, but nobody has come forward so far, said the minister.         
	The project, along with some other schemes, has thus been stalled. It is the common people living in remote areas who will suffer, he added.        
	Asked about the mounting dues of electricity bills in the hills  estimated to be over Rs 16 crore by now  following the non-payment by subscribers after a diktat issued by the Morcha, the minister said: We are aware of the loss but we will continue to supply power to the hills on humanitarian grounds as long as we can sustain it. We cannot say what will happen if the dues continue to increase.        
	During his visit, Banerjee launched the Rajiv Gandhi Rural Electrification Scheme at the Siliguri Mahakuma Parishad at a function held in Phansidewa. In the Mahakuma Parishad area, 19,000 BPL families will be provided with electricity free of cost by spending Rs 2,200 per family. Also, the ancillary infrastructure for distribution of power would be set up in the villages, he said.         
	In Bengal, 31 lakh BPL families will get connections, for which Rs 677 crore would be spent.        
	In the evening, Banerjee met representatives of planters and tea trade union leaders at the circuit house here to discuss the progress of individual electricity connection to be provided at the workers quarters in tea estates. We have instructed our officers and all others concerned to meet on March 12 and work for a specific action plan to execute the scheme in all the tea gardens of north Bengal, the minister said.

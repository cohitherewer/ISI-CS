The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Mamata muted 
                                                                                                               Mamata muted 
          OUR BUREAU                           In a bind?                                  
	Oct. 20: Mamata Banerjee today neither condemned the ki-lling and abduction of police personnel, nor used the opportunity to criticise Buddhadeb Bhattacharjees government for its failure to firmly deal with Left extremists.        
	The CPM again pointed at a Maoist-Mamata nexus.        
	The Trinamul Congress chief merely told a TV channel she was shocked and hurt (shokahata ebong marmahata).         
	Unusually, she avoided meeting reporters at her Kalighat home, though she was there through the day.         
	CPM state secretariat member Mohammad Salim said Mamata and her Trinamul had made a common cause with Maoist leader Kishanji by sharing the demand for withdrawal of the joint forces from Lalgarh.         
	Accusing Mamata of doublespeak, Salim said she should make her position clear on the crackdown on the guerrillas.         
	Now, Kishanji wants Mamata to ensure the withdrawal of forces, Salim said. If she is opposed to the Maoists, she should ask for Kishanjis arrest after what happened today.         
	Governor Gopalkrishna Gandhi was clear in his condemnation of todays attack. Left-wing extremists must realise that no just cause can be secured by such diabolism; retribution will overtake them, he said in a statement.        
	Mamata skipped the rally at Esplanade this afternoon to protest the states prevailing lawlessness. Trinamul sources said she did not want to be in a situation where she could be compelled to comment on the attack.         
	Her lieutenant Partha Chatterjee, who had laid siege to Writers Buildings on Friday demanding the chief ministers arrest, also did not condemn the Maoist strike while speaking to an unusually sparse audience at the rally.         
	Instead, he trained his guns on the CPM for its bid to establish Trinamul workers links with the Maoists.        
	Salim iterated his allegation that Fridays Writers siege was Mamatas attempt to deflect peoples attention from the Congress-led Centre and the Left-ruled states agreement on the offensive against the Maoists.         
	He asked the Congress to question its partners position on the Maoists. The Centre is co-ordinating with the affected states, including Bengal, for a planned crackdown on the Maoists. But Mamata Banerjee is opposing the move on one pretext or the other despite being a central minister.        
	The partners owe an explanation to the people if they continue to pull at opposite poles on major issues, he added.         
	The Congress condemned todays attack. It also said the state governments inept handling of the Maoists was responsible for the strike.

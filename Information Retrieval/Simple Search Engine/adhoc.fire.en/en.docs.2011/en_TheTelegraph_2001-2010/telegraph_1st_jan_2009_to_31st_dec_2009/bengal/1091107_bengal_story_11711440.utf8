	Calcutta, Nov. 6: The government has asked district magistrates and police chiefs to find out the causes of political clashes that have rocked the state since the Lok Sabha polls.        
	We have asked them to find out the causes behind the violence. They have also been told to convene all-party meetings if necessary, chief secretary Asok Mohan Chakrabarti said. A probe will also be held to determine whether police took proper steps to combat the violence when Mamata Banerjee went to address a rally in Arambagh on Wednesday.

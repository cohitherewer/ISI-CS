	Siliguri, March 3: Union ministers Pranab Mukherjee and Mani Shankar Aiyar will address Congress leaders and supporters of north Bengal here on Saturday, kicking off the campaigning for the coming general elections.        
	The meeting will mark the beginning of poll campaign of the Congress in north Bengal, said Shankar Malakar, the president of the partys Darjeeling district committee. Our people, aware of the alliance with the Trinamul Congress, are eagerly waiting for direction from the senior leaders for canvassing in the coming polls.        
	Party sources said PCC leaders and around 10,000 supporters including the panchayat members of north Bengal would attend the meeting.        
	Mukherjees presence and speech will give us confidence, while Aiyar, who heads the Union panchayati raj ministry, is expected to focus on the series of rural development schemes carried out by the UPA government over the past five years, a party leader said. The deliberations will not only help the Congress members and leaders to clear any doubts about the schemes, but will also equip them with data for campaigning in the rural areas.        
	Although the Congress did not name the probable candidates for Darjeeling, Jalpaiguri and Alipurduar, insiders, however, said the district committees had proposed the names of Dawa Narbula, the sitting MP from Darjeeling, Mani Kumar Darnal, the Opposition leader in the Jalpaiguri Zilla Parishad, and Atul Subba, a trade union leader, for the three seats.        
	The Left Front made the formal announcement today. Jibitesh Sarkar, a state committee member, has been chosen for the Darjeeling seat, while Mahendra Roy, the sitting CPM MLA from Rajganj, would be the alliances candidate from Jalpaiguri. Bengal minister of state for public works Manohar Tirkey of the RSP will contest from Alipurduar.        
	In the 2004 parliamentary elections, Mani Thapa had lost to Narbula, while Minati Sen (CPM) and Joachim Buxla (RSP) were the Front MPs from the Jalpaiguri and Alipurduar seats.         
	Sens name has not been proposed as the seat has been converted into a reserved one for Scheduled Castes this time and Buxla is reported to have been dropped for his alleged hobnobbing with the Akhil Bharatiya Adivasi Vikas Parishad that has been spearheading an anti-Gorkhaland movement in the Dooars. If fielded, he runs the risk of losing Nepali votes.        
	In 2004, the Front had bagged four seats  Cooch Behar (Forward Bloc), Alipurduar, Jalpaiguri and Balurghat (RSP), while the Congress had won in Darjeeling, Raiganj and Malda.

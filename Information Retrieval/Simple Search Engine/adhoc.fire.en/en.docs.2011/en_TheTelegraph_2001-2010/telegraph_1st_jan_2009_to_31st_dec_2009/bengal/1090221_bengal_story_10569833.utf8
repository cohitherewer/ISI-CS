The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Party to tap Basu charisma
                                                                                                               Party to tap Basu charisma
  - Ailing CPM patriarch to star in rallies and audio campaign        OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                                    
	Calcutta, Feb. 20: The CPM is planning to parachute 94-year-old Jyoti Basu to breathe life into the faction-ridden organisation and woo voters before what it admits will be the toughest election in 30 years.        
	The ailing patriarch stepped into the state party headquarters after over six months today to attend a meeting that discussed candidates for the Lok Sabha polls.         
	Doctors have advised him to move around occasionally to keep fit, said an aide.         
	Basu didnt speak much at the meeting, state secretariat members said. He also did not respond to reporters queries about the CPMs possible stand on the Congress in case of a hung Parliament.         
	The party brass, however, were elated at his mere presence. They called a photographer of the party mouthpiece and posed together with Basu, the lone survivor from the first politburo. All secretariat members, including chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee, lined up for the photo-op.        
	His presence made us more than happy.... It will be our good luck if his health permits him to attend some election rallies in the city and its suburbs, secretariat member Shyamal Chakraborty said.        
	Knowing well that Basu may not be able to move around much, his video and audio messages would be an important part of the partys campaign. It will harp on the continuity of policies of successive Left Front governments and focus on the faithful, farmers and front unity.         
	Another secretariat member said the party was mulling conventions with Basu, the star attraction. He is the epitome of continuity not only in the government but also in the party. He can infuse a sense of common purpose and urgency in the rank and file.        
	After the controversy over land acquisition rocked the Left Front and eroded a sec- tion of its support base, the CPM had fielded Basu. State party secretary Biman Bose had read out his message endorsing the proposed chemical hub on Nayachar at the fronts first poll rally on February 8.         
	The patriarch had slammed the Mamata Banerjee-led Opposition for its anti-development, anti-state politics.         
	However, the party is yet to finalise its candidates. Talks with the district committees are on. The list will be finalised by the end of this month, said veteran Benoy Konar.         
	He ruled out fielding someone from outside the party against Mamata in Calcutta South. A section of the leadership, he added, wanted Haldia strongman and Tamluk MP Lakshman Seths re-nomination, though he is largely held responsible for the flare-up in Nandigram that triggered the partys rural poll setbacks.        
	Buddha sermon        
	At a closed-door session in Howrah, Bhattacharjee told party functionaries not to be scared of a Congress-Trinamul alliance. In elections, two and two dont always make four, he was quoted as saying.        
	The chief minister said Mamata should be portrayed in the campaign as not only anti-industry but also anti-state  one who supports the Gorkhaland movement in north Bengal and the Maoist-led tribal agitation in the west.

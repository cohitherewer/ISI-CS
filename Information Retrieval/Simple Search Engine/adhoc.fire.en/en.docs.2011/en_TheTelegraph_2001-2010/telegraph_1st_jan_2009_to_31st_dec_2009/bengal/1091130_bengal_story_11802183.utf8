The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Turf war kills son of Citu leader
                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      Turf war kills son of Citu leader
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Malda, Nov. 29: The son of a Citu leader was shot dead in a Malda pocket in a suspected fallout of a CPM-Congress turf war raging since early this year.        
	Rasel Sheikh, 30, was killed at Jadupur in the restive Kaliachak area a day after both parties organised a joint peace march.         
	The murder sparked fears of tit-for-tat killings in Malda, a Congress stronghold.        
	Rasels father Abdul Sheikh, a truck driver and leader of the CPMs labour arm, alleged that police had done nothing despite his complaints that the family was being threatened by Congress goons.         
	The killings in Jadupur started on January 27, when CPM worker Anwar Hussain was shot dead. The CPM had blocked National Highway 34 in protest but soon after it was lifted, the Congresss Atabuddin Sheikh was found dead.        
	Two CPM and two Congress workers have been killed in the past month, prompting a series of peace meetings and marches ahead of yesterdays Id.         
	Rasels murder also appears to belie CPM state secretary Biman Boses contention that all-party meetings can contain political violence. He was referring to Mamata Banerjees call for central intervention in Khanakul in Hooghly where a Trinamul Congress supporter was killed when alleged CPM activists descended on two villages in a Nandigram-style recapture bid on Thursday.         
	In Malda, a senior police officer blamed the killings on the turf war. All the killings are attempts by the Congress and the CPM to consolidate their support bases. Both are using hardened anti-socials, a senior officer said.        
	CPM district secretary Jiban Moitra echoed the charges made by Rasels father, saying a list of criminals threatening party members in Kaliachak had been handed over to the police but they did nothing.        
	The Congress MP from Malda South, Abu Hashem Khan Chowdhury, claimed the killings were a result of infighting within the CPM. Who is responsible in nurturing these gangs? The infighting in the CPM in Jadupur and (nearby) Mojampur is responsible for these killings.         
	The police suspect gangster Kurban Sheikh in Rasels murder. Kurban is involved in more than one murder and has been eluding the police, said district police chief Bhuban Mondol.        
	Cop injured        
	A policeman was beaten with sticks by alleged CPM supporters when a team of six went to a Congress activists house under attack in Burdwans Mangalkot.         
	The Congress activist, Amar Ghosh, is in jail custody in connection with the murder of a CPM leader in June.

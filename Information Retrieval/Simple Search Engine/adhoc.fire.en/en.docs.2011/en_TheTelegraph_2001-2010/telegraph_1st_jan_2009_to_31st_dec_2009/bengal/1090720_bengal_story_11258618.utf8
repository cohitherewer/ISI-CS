	Burdwan, July 19: CPM activists today torched a Congress supporters house 200 metres from a police camp at the village in Mangalkot where Opposition MLAs were assaulted on Wednesday and a Bengal bandh was called in protest.        
	Kartick Deys two-storey, mud-walled house was vacant as he had gone to visit his el- der brother in Durgapur with his family. About 10 CPM supporters came early this morning, sprinkled kerosene on its thatched roof and set it ablaze, said neighbour Rabi Das.        
	The villagers said there was no policeman at the camp a few houses away at Dhanyarukhi village.        
	It is debatable whether the police would have prevented the attack. In Calcutta, they stood aside and watched the vandalism that followed the attack on the Congress MLAs.        
	An officer said the house was gutted by the time the cops reached half an hour later. The camp was set up yesterday and the policemen had gone out on patrol, he said, admitting that at least six of the 16 policemen deployed there should have been at the camp.        
	For some reason they werent there, the officer added.        
	Additional superintendent of police Humayun Kabir, who visited Mangalkot, said: We will try our best to prevent such incidents in the future.        
	Local Congress MLA Ra- bindranath Chatterjee, who had received eight stitches after being hit on the head during the CPM assault on Wednesday, said Dey was an active supporter of his party. He is lucky not to have been at home.         
	We do not trust the police. Their brief is to protect the CPM, the Katwa MLA added.        
	An officer defended the cops, saying the village was big and they were yet to get used to its lanes and bylanes.         
	Eleven people, including Tapan Pal who had been named in the FIR, have been held in connection with the assault on the MLAs.         
	Railway police tonight held a Murshidabad man with about 7kg of explosives at Katwa station.

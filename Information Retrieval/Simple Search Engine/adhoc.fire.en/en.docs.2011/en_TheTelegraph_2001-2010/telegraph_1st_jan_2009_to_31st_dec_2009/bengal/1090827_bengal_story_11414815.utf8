          OUR CORRESPONDENT                          Nazmul. Telegraph picture                                  
	Tamluk, Aug. 26: A Class XII student who wore the wrong pants to school because his only uniform had got wet was caned unconscious by a teacher in Nandigram this afternoon.        
	Nazmul Hoda returned to his senses a couple of hours later, but was unable to speak till late tonight. He had been hit on his head, hands and back.         
	We have put him on oxygen because he was having breathing problems. He is under observation, said Alok Shee, the attending doctor.         
	Nazmuls father, a small farmer and imam of a local mosque, has lodged an FIR against Ranajit Sashmal, the assistant headmaster of BMT High School. Sashmal is missing.        
	Nazmul had come to school in black trousers, said Saddam Hossain, his classmate. The school uniform is white shirt and navy blue trousers.         
	The teacher spotted Nazmul in the second period when he was about to leave after his math class around noon. Sir asked him why he was not in uniform. Nazmul explained that his blue trouser had got soiled as it was raining when we returned home from school yesterday, said Saddam.        
	Nazmul tried to explain that he came from a poor family, had only one pair of blue trousers and that is why he had to wear the other one sometimes, but the teacher wouldnt listen.        
	Saddam said Sashmal told Nazmul he had been warned earlier against wearing any other colour to school and whipped out a cane he always carried to class. Nazmul was repeatedly hit on his hands and back for about two minutes. When he doubled up in pain, he was hit on the head and neck. Nazmul kept writhing in pain as the teacher walked out. Then he became unconscious, said a boy who did not want to be named.        
	Classmates sprinkled water on his face and carried him 300 metres to the Nandigram block hospital, from where he was referred to the district hospital in Tamluk.        
	Nazmuls father earns about Rs 1,500 a month as the imam and we get very little from our small plot. My elder son is learning tailoring jobs. My daughter is in Class VII. We cant afford a spare uniform, said Sahida Bibi, 40, the mother.

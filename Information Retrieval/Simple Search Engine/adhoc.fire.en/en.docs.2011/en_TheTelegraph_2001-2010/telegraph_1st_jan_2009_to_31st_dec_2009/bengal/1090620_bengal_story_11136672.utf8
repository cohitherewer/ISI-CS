The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Trinamul worries over risk to image
                                                                                                               Trinamul worries over risk to image
          CHARU SUDAN KASTURI AND BARUN GHOSH                          A leaflet dropped from a copter, appealing to Lalgarh villagers not to fall prey to the Maoists provocations and to approach the local administration with their grievances. (Amit Datta)                                  
	June 19: The participation of central forces in the Lalgarh crackdown and an open challenge from a Maoist leader for support has left the Trinamul Congress worried that its carefully crafted pro-poor image may receive a dent.        
	Any allegation of human rights abuse against tribals by forces sent by the Centre could push it on the back foot in Bengal, senior leaders said.        
	The party is also concerned that its strategy to differentiate between the Naxalites and ordinary tribals  Mamata Banerjee has asked the Bengal government to ban the CPI (Maoist)  could backfire.        
	These fears have arisen after a Maoist leader challenged Trinamul to choose between supporting the people and allowing central forces to par-ticipate in the Lalgarh assault. If what Mamata Banerjee told rallies during the Nandigram struggle is true, she should take a stand and support the people, Maoist leader Koteshwar Rao said yesterday.        
	Union home minister P. Chidambaram today defended Trinamul, saying the allegations against it or the Congress of supporting the Maoists were unfortunate and incorrect. But his certificate may not be enough for Trinamul to wriggle out of CPM allegations that it is implicitly backing the Maoists.        
	During its opposition to the Tatas in Singur and the battles with the state government in Nandigram, the CPM had argued that outsiders, including Maoists, were fomenting trouble. Trinamul had rejected the charge.        
	Today, if we argue, like the CPM did, that the Maoists are outsiders and do not represent the concerns of the people, it could backfire on us, a Trinamul leader argued.        
	Lalgarh leader Chhatradhar Mahato today asked: Why is Mamata Banerjee not being vocal about the use of central forces against us?        
	Mamata today called back all her MPs to Bengal and sent Nandigram leader Sisir Adhikari to West Midnapore. She has assigned two jobs to the MPs: to counter the campaign linking her party with the Maoists and to keep her posted on whether innocent tribals were being killed in Lalgarh.        
	Sources said she would not leave the state for the time being and was meeting officials at home for the railway budget to be presented on July 3.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Promise of 1 lakh jobs
                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      Promise of 1 lakh jobs
          OUR BUREA                      Mamata Banerjee: Santa                          
	Dankuni, Dec. 26: Mamata Banerjee today promised one lakh jobs after laying the foundation stone for two factories that will make locomotive components in Dankuni.        
	(Bengals) industrial renaissance will start from Dankuni. The two factories and (their) ancillaries will generate employment for one lakh people, Mamata told the programme.         
	It was not clear what ancillary units the railway minister was talking about but she said there was bound to be many ancillaries whenever there is a big industry.        
	Earth removal has start- ed for the Rs 110-crore project 20km northwest of Calcutta.        
	The promise of jobs in Dankuni is all the more significant because the town is barely 25km from Singur, where the abandoned Tata Motors project site symbolises anti-industry politics, which Mamata has desperately tried to distance herself from since assuming office in Delhi.        
	Ironically, it was the 400 acres occupied by Tata Motors ancillary units that had raised her hackles. She had wanted those units shifted and the land returned to farmers.        
	Dankuni will become a big industrial hub, Mamata said today in the presence of railway board members and Amit Mitra, who heads an expert panel she has formed. Dankuni will be the key to industrialisation and not a lock, Mamata said.        
	However, senior railway officials admitted in private that the one lakh jobs figure was unrealistic.         
	The Tata plant in Singur and its 50-odd ancillaries were expected to provide direct and indirect employment to about 10,000 people.        
	In the past three months, Mamata said, the railways have created a land bank of 1.13 lakh acres. Of that, 500 acres are in Dankuni. The railways have lots of land lying unused. To create a land bank, we need not forcefully acquire land or shed blood, she said.         
	The plants in Dankuni will manufacture components for train engines, to be made in Chittaranjan Locomotive Works, Burdwan, and Diesel Locomotive Works, Varanasi.

	Burdwan, June 15: Five men stepped out of an ashram, stopped a CPM leader on a motorcycle and pumped four bullets into him this morning.        
	Police said Falguni Mu- kherjee, 50, a member of the CPMs Burdwan district committee, was going to a party office from his home near Katwa when attacked.         
	The gunmen surrounded him not far from his destination  Kherur, 7km from his house at Dhanyarukhi village  and fired at him from point blank range around 9.30am.        
	It appears that all five were hiding inside the ashram, belonging to a village godman called Lalbaba, and emerged from it seeing Mukherjee, said additional superintendent of police Humayun Kabir.        
	The 65-year-old Lalbaba has been detained for questioning. The man who used to beg for a living built the single-storey, mud-walled ashram about 15 years ago. Villagers said he had several hundred disciples.        
	Alerted by the shots, people came running near the ashram, in a deserted part of the village. Mukherjee was in a pool of blood, his bike next to him.         
	Over 200 CPM supporters ransacked the ashram and set it ablaze after assaulting Lalbaba, said a police officer.        
	District party secretary Amal Haldar alleged that the Trinamul Congress was behind the murder.         
	Kabir said a murder case had been started at Mangalkot police station against 13 people on the basis of an FIR. But no arrest has been made yet.         
	Mukherjee was a functionary of the party-run Burdwan zilla parishad. His wife Jaba, also a party wholetimer like him, is a leader of the womens wing. They have a daughter, a a Class VIII student.        
	The CPM has called a 12-hour bandh in Katwa, 150km from Calcutta, tomorrow.         
	Chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee was told about the death during a meeting with Left Front legislators before the start of the budget session.         
	Burdwan is still a red fort, but Mamata Banerjees party snatched the local Bhalogram gram panchayat from the CPM in last years rural polls.         
	Haldar said Trinamul had let loose anarchy but also admitted: They fared better than us in this panchayat area in the Lok Sabha polls, too.         
	Trinamul district secretary Bikash Chowdhury said the murder was a result of squabbles within the CPM.

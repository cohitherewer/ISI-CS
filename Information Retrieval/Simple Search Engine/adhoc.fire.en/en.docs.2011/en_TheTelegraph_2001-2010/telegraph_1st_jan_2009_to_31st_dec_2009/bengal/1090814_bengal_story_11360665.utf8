The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Council killed off, Morcha eyes state
                                                                                                               Council killed off, Morcha eyes state
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Darjeeling, Aug. 13: The Gorkha Janmukti Morcha today claimed that statehood and Union territory status for the Darjeeling hills were the only options left now that a decision had been taken to drop the Sixth Schedule bill and scrap the autonomous hill council.         
	The consensus on repealing the DGHC Act of 1988 and abandoning the bill that would have given the hills a special status under the Sixth Schedule of the Constitution have put an end to the possibility of another autonomous body, the Morcha believes.         
	This means the only option is either a Union territory or a state, Morcha spokesperson Anmole Prasad told a news conference at the Gymkhana Club here today.         
	Prasad was part of the 12-member Morcha team that returned from Delhi today after tripartite talks with representatives of the state and the Centre.         
	The Morcha sees the set-up to replace the hill council as an interim arrangement. We are not too worried about the interim set-up as it is necessary to fill the administrative vacuum once the DGHC goes. However, we will ensure that the 7,000 temporary (hill council) workers do not lose out. They will be protected, Prasad said. Whatever agreement was reached at the August 11 meeting, the demand for statehood has not been diluted.        
	Fearing an uncertain future after it became clear that the DGHC would be dissolved soon, the contractual workers had yesterday reasserted their demand for permanent jobs.         
	The Morcha defended its highway blockade and accused state chief secretary Asok Mohan Chakrabarti and home secretary Ardhendu Sen of trying to tarnish the hill outfits image in Delhi.         
	They brought up the issue of Gorkhaland Personnel cracking down on liquor, drug and timber smugglers as well as stopping traffic to Sikkim along NH31A. But we could convince the Union governments representatives that, as citizens, we had every right to clamp down on illegal activities and the blockade of the highway was a compulsion, said Prasad.         
	The outfit welcomed the appointment of an interlocutor. As the interval between two rounds of talks is four to six months (the previous round was held in December 2008 and the next is due this December), an interlocutor was necessary. Through him the negotiations can be speeded up, the Morcha spokesperson said.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Jute mill talks fail
                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      Jute mill talks fail
                            
	Calcutta, Dec. 13: Jute mills across the state will shut down indefinitely from tomorrow with the fourth tripartite talks in recent times failing at the Writers Buildings today.        
	The meeting today failed because of the companies unfortunate and rigid attitude. We will, however, continue to try for a solution through talks, labour minister Anadi Sahu said after the meeting.        
	According to him, arrears of Rs 300 crore in gratuity, Rs 149 crore in provident fund and Rs 105 crore in employees state insurance (ESI) are due to workers but the mills are unwilling to pay immediately. The other demands of the 20 labour unions going on strike are payment of agreed wages and dearness allowance.        
	Sanjay Kajaria of the Indian Jute Mills Association blamed the impasse on the Centres reluctance to revise prices at which it buys gunny bags. Forty-five per cent of our products are bought by the government and the payment formula hasnt changed since 2001.

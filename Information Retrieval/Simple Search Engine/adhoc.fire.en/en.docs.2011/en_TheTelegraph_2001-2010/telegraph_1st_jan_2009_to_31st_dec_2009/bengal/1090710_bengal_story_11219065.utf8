                                                                                                               Buzz on KLO chief arrest
          OUR BUREAU                              
	July 9: Senior BSF officers today said they have heard that KLO leader Jiban Singh had been arrested in Bangladesh, but refused to confirm it.         
	Singh, the self-styled commander of the outfit, had been picked by the Bangladesh Rifles and the countrys police intelligence from a hotel in Rajshahi district this morning, the border force said.        
	Sources in the BSFs intelligence branch in north Bengal said Singh, about 45 years old, had checked into a hotel as Mohammad Ismail in Samtahar in Rajshahi.        
	The deputy inspector-general of the BSFs Malda range, Prabhat Singh Tomar, said he was not sure about the news. I heard from somewhere that Jiban Singh has been arrested in Bangladesh, but there is no confirmation, he said.         
	We have heard about the arrest, but no senior BDR officer is willing to go on record, said a reporter of a Bangladesh daily from Dhaka.        
	Malda superintendent of police Satyajit Banerjee said: It is a matter for Dhaka to inform Delhi as protocol demands, not for me to know.         
	Medha plea        
	Calcutta High Court has asked the West Midnapore district magistrate to inform in 15 days why police did not let Medha Patkar visit Lalgarh.

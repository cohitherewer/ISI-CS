	Calcutta, Dec. 30: Family members of a Congress worker who was allegedly killed by a Trinamul man today met chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee demanding justice.        
	We told him about the incident (in Habra, North 24-Parganas) and requested him to get the culprits arrested immediately. We also told him that we had named the culprits to police but they were roaming freely in the area, said Bapi Chowdhurys mother Reba.         
	With Bapi, Trinamul supporter Ranjit Roy was killed on December 20 when motorcycle-borne attackers opened fire on a blood donation camp on the sidelines of which a childrens sit-and-draw was being held.         
	Bapis mother Reba had named Trinamuls Raju Dam as one of the prime accused. She was accompanied by Bapis widow Kakali and 14-year-old daughter Priya today.         
	They broke down while telling the chief minister how they feared attacks from Bapis killers, officials said.        
	The chief minister has assured them security and told them the culprits would be arrested. He has asked them to see that Priya continues her education and said the government would extend all help, said an official.         
	The state police chief said an armed guard had been posted outside their house.

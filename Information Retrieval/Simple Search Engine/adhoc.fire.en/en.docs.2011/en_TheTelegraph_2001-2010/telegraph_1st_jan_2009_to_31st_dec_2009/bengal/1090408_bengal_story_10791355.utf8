          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Calcutta, April 7: The SUCI today said it will not withdraw any of the eight candidates it has put up flouting the terms of the Bengal Opposition alliance        
	This has sparked a clamour in the Congress to put up a candidate in Joynagar, the lone seat the Trinamul ally was allowed to contest.        
	When Trinamul Congress chief Mamata Banerjee and Bengal Congress president Pranab Mukherjee sealed the alliance, it had been decided that the Congress would field nominees from 14 seats and Trinamul 26 seats. One seat would go to Somen Mitra and Joynagar to the SUCI.        
	But today, SUCI state secretary Pravas Ghosh said: We are not going to withdraw any of our candidates.         
	The eight places where the SUCI has fielded its candidates are among the seats that the Congress is contesting.        
	We are under tremendous pressure from party workers in South-24 Parganas to field our candidate in Joynagar, state Congress working president Pradip Bhattacharya said, adding that the high command had been told about the sentiments of the party rank and file.        
	Rao visit        
	AICC general secretary K.Keshava Rao will stop in Calcutta tomorrow on his way to Ranchi. He will meet state Congress leaders.

	Calcutta, Oct. 25: Around 300 police personnel from Bengal are now being trained in army and BSF camps to man a commando unit being raised especially to deal with Maoists.         
	The first batch will join the battlefield in trouble-torn West Midnapore, Bankura and Purulia in about a month.        
	These policemen are going through training in jungle warfare at the army base at Binnaguri in north Bengal and the Patiala camp of the Border Security Force (BSF). They will be trained in counter-insurgency and launching surprise strikes on enemy hideouts, said a senior police officer.         
	Among those undergoing training are two officers of deputy superintendent rank, the officer added. The 280 others are constables.        
	Sources said the state government initiated the move in the wake of the Maoist killing spree that followed the security forces march to Lalgarh in June. The ongoing crackdown has repeatedly exposed polices lack of preparedness to fight on a turf the guerrillas are apparently more familiar with.        
	We do not have a specialised combat force like the Greyhounds of Andhra Pradesh to deal with the Maoists. This is the first time we are going to have a batch of specially trained policemen, said an officer.        
	While picking the 282 for training, emphasis was laid on physical strength and shooting abilities. They were chosen from the three Maoist-hit districts because they will have a better idea of the battlefield than those elsewhere, the officer said.         
	We looked into their record of chasing Maoists in forests and knowledge of the topography of the area. They should be ready in a month.        
	According to sources, the new group will be able to raid a Maoist hideout in a dense forest even in darkness. They are also being trained to chase guerrillas during a gun battle.        
	The deputy superintendents are learning to plan offensives. They will be taught how to engage guerrillas in a faux encounter while other policemen cordon off the escape routes and trap the enemy, an officer said.         
	The elite force will also be trained to survive several days in a forest adopting the same methods as the guerrillas.         
	In most recent cases, our personnel had to retreat because they were not well trained in jungle warfare. We are preparing for a more intense offensive against the Maoists and the new force will be engaged as soon as they return from their training session, said a senior officer.        
	A separate unit is being raised for Calcutta. Around 1,000 personnel are being trained to deal with terrorist strikes in the city and possible hostage situations.         
	However, unlike the Greyhounds, the Bengal commandos are likely to be paid on a par with their colleagues elsewhere in the state.         
	The police brass have been pushing the government for a risk allowance and special life insurance, saying their absence robs forces of motivation.         
	Director-general of police Bhupinder Singh had recommended a risk allowance of 30 per cent of salary for personnel in Maoist-hit areas. But the government is yet to respond, a senior officer said.

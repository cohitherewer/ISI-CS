The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Battle for Muslims and Marwaris
                                                                                                               Battle for Muslims and Marwaris
          ANINDYA SENGUPTA IN CALCUTTA NORTH                            Trinamuls Sudip Bandopadhyay and the CPMs Mohammad Salim during their campaigns on Sunday. (Bishwarup Dutta)                                 
	If Mamata Banerjee comes to power, three things are for sure in Bengal.        
	You can spend nice even-ings with your girlfriend by the Thames. A four-hour ride on a local train will take you to Goa. And an overnight journey by Darjeeling Mail will transport you to Asias Switzerland!        
	These were heard at election meetings in Maniktala and Belgachhia on Sunday evening from CPM voices laced with ridicule while describing the Trinamul Congress manifesto that talks of making Calcutta a London, Digha a Goa and north Bengal a Switzerland.        
	For Arijit Manna of Tala Park, the CPMs ridicule and jibes are justified. After killing Singur, Didi is now talking of Goa and Switzerland. When Trinamul was in control of Calcutta Municipal Corporation, what prevented her from making Calcutta a London? he asks.        
	This should be music to the ears of Mohammad Salim, the CPM candidate from Calcutta North who faces a tough battle against Trinamuls Sudip Bandopadhyay.        
	If the CPMs election meetings on Sunday evening were a cause of concern for Sudip, the holiday morning was no less worrisome.        
	The brew in leaflets tucked between pages of some vernacular newspapers was stronger than that in his morning cup of tea when Sudip went flipping through the pages. The leaflets, which said they had been issued by local Congressmen, screamed out his and wife Nayanas remarks when the couple were not on speaking terms with Mamata, before the 2004 Lok Sabha polls.        
	Sitting at his SN Banerjee Road residence on Monday, Sudip said: I had a feeling that Salim was fighting a political and not a personal battle. The way hawkers were used by the CPM to distribute leaflets along with some newspapers on Sunday to malign me shows Salims losing ground.        
	Salim was quick to react, saying: I am not aware of such things. I am confident of getting votes from all sections, though the Opposition is trying to spread canards against me in Muslim areas.        
	The earlier Calcutta North West and North East seats were sandwiched to make Calcutta North. Behind the high stakes here is a mass of statistical data that may be worrisome for the CPM candidate but not much of an inspiration for Mamatas nominee either.        
	In the 2004 Lok Sabha polls, both North West and North East elected CPM nominees  Sudhanshu Sil and Salim. But the combined Opposition votes in the two constituencies  now Calcutta North  were nearly 23,000 more than that of the CPM.        
	In the Assembly segments of Chowringhee, Entally, Beleghata, Jorasanko, Shyampukur, Maniktala and Cossipore, which now make Calcutta North with 14 lakh voters, the electoral pattern was almost similar in the 2006 Assembly elections  the combined Opposition was 22,920 votes ahead of the CPM.         
	But Sudip is not at ease with the Oppositions 23,000-vote lead in 2004 or 2006, going by a STAR Ananda-GFK Mode survey in early April, which says:        
	 61 per cent of the voters believe Sudips credibility has gone down because of switching party loyalties        
	 60 per cent of minority voters have said they would stand by Salim        
	 68.5 per cent of minorities prefer the CPM while 29.6 per cent favour the Opposition alliance        
	 61 per cent of new voters prefer the CPM while 36 per cent want the Opposition        
	 Taking into account the preferences of new voters and a possible swing, 46.7 per cent want the Opposition while 46.9 per cent favour the CPM        
	Sudips only consolation is the finding that 77 per cent of the voters believe the alliance with the Congress has increased his winning prospects.        
	These findings have made Sudip desperate to woo the 3.5 lakh-odd minority voters of this constituency. From Narkledanga to Rajabazar, Zakaria Street to Belgachhia, Kalabagan to Marcus Square  areas with high minority concentration  the Trinamul candidate has left no stone unturned, even campaigning with a fez.        
	He also put an insertion in a Urdu daily that if voted to power, he would try to make Urdu the second official language across the state, though his party manifesto says this will be done in areas where Muslims are 10 per cent or more of the population.        
	The Left government didnt make Urdu the second official language and Muslims are peeved, said Mohammed Hashem of Zakaria Street.        
	Sensing the Oppositions efforts to make inroads into the Muslim belts, the CPM has cleverly turned to another M factor  the three lakh-strong Marwari community  trying to instil in their minds how Trinamul had campaigned during the Rizwanur Rahman case against their brethren.        
	Not to be left behind, Sudip had a host of meetings on Kalakar Street and in the eastern parts of the constituency with the Marwaris, though he has to admit that the BJPs Tathagata Roy will cut into the vote bank to some extent.        
	It remains to be seen who has the last laugh in Calcutta North that had elected a scientist like Meghnad Saha once and well-known lawyer Asoke Sen several times between 1962 and 1984.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Lalgarh mob lays siege to Calcutta
                                                                                                               Lalgarh mob lays siege to Calcutta

	Calcutta, April 24: Tribals from Lalgarh choked Calcutta this evening, blocking Theatre Road and Chowringhee for hours after alleging that a traffic sergeant had thrashed the driver of a bus they were travelling in and demanding an apology from the policeman.        
	Along with their supporters in the city, the tribals blocked Theatre Road for over three hours and then shifted to the Chowringhee Road-SN Banerjee intersection, where they spent another two hours.        
	The citys traumatic tryst with the protesters, many of them armed with bows, arrows and machetes, continued from 4.30pm to 9.30pm.        
	It ended after police commissioner Gautam Mohan Chakrabarti apologised to Chhatradhar Mahato of the Peoples Committee Against Police Atrocities and promised to look into their complaint.        
	The trouble broke out when six buses from West Midnapore lost their way while heading to Rani Rashmoni Avenue for a rally to celebrate being able to bring the administration down to its knees and force it to reduce the number of polling centres in Lalgarh to four from 40.         
	The committee, which has been leading a resistance against the police since November, had vowed not to allow security forces to fan out across Lalgarh on polling day (April 30).        
	The sergeant stopped the buses at the AJC Bose Road-Theatre Road crossing. Rabindranath Bhuniya, who was at the wheel of the first bus, said: I couldnt produce any document (he claimed his licence had been seized by a cop in Midnapore) and the officer demanded Rs 1,000. When I refused, he tore my shirt and pun- ched me on the face.        
	Deputy commissioner (traffic) Dilip Banerjee said the bribe charge was being probed. Ive heard that the driver had violated a traffic signal.        
	Seeing the altercation, about 40 members of the Lalgarh Sanghati Mancha, which consists of supporters of the tribal agitation in Calcutta, got off their vehicles and started squatting on the road. They also called the tribals at the rally venue, who arrived soon with more Mancha supporters.        
	Senior officers like DC, south, Rajesh Subarno, and additional commissioner Shivaji Ghosh, who rushed to the spot, refused to concede to the demand to call the sergeant there and make him apologise.         
	After about three hours, during which the police tried to persuade the tribals and their supporters to move, the protesters decided to head to Chowringhee. More negotiations followed in front of Metro cinema until the police commissioner expressed his apologies around 9.30pm.         
	I believe the Calcutta police would not be inhuman like Lalgarh police. The commissioner has promised to take proper action (against the sergeant) in a week, Mahato said.         
	He also apologised to Cal- cuttans for the trouble he inflicted on them. Im very sorry, he said.        
	The police said traffic on AJC Bose Road, Theatre Road, Chowringhee, Park Street, Park Circus and SN Banerjee Road was severely hit for several hours.

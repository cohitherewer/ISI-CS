The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Glare on officers lapses in cop death 
                                                                                                               Glare on officers lapses in cop death 
          A STAFF REPORTER                           Arindam Manna                                  
	Calcutta, Feb. 14: Arindam Manna has been referred to as an unknown person in the inquest report though railway police personnel had found the sub-inspectors I-card in his shirt pocket, officers probing the death said.         
	The Government Railway Polices seizure list mentions his identity card but the body of Manna, a railway police officer who had briefly probed Rizwanur Rahmans death, was sent for post-mortem as that of an unidentified male.         
	Insiders said local officers had not photographed his body, found on the tracks in Mankundu, Hooghly, on Tuesday. According to the rule, four photographs  from the east, west, north and south  should have been taken.        
	Mannas head was some 20ft from the body when it was found. An officer said the Sheoraphuli Government Railway Polices report did not give details of Mannas injuries.        
	The probe will ascertain if there have been procedural lapses in handling the body. If it appears that there have been mistakes, action will be taken, said Dilip Mitra, additional director-general, railways.         
	Inspector-general Amar Kanti Sarkar and superintendent Tapan Das today spoke to railway police officers at Sheoraphuli, under which Mankundu comes, and Dum Dum, where Manna was posted.         
	Their report will be ready by Monday and an officer said that heads could roll.        
	Besides going to his Dum Dum office on Tuesday, Manna had apparently been to several places  Kamarkundu, Gurap, and Bandel in Hooghly.        
	We will try to find out if the officer was under duress because of professional reasons or matters relating to his family and then try to ascertain if anyone could have murdered him. Since a murder case has been lodged, we will try to find out who could have murdered him, said a senior CID officer.         
	The sleuths are waiting for the final post-mortem report. Experts at the State Forensic Science Laboratory today said they were yet to receive Mannas viscera from the Medical College and Hospital.         
	We will get them next week, an officer said.

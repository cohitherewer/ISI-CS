The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Extortion whiff in rebel killings 
                                                                                                               Extortion whiff in rebel killings 
          NARESH JANA                              
	Sirish (West Midnapore), July 11: The CPI (Maoist) today claimed responsibility for killing two corrupt CPM leaders in West Midnapore but the son of one victim said extortion was the motive as neither man was a CPM leader.        
	Maoist leader Bikash today said Baren Mahato and Gurucharan Mahato were punished for making money by duping poor adivasis in Sirish, a village 25km from Lalgarh.        
	But ration trader Barens 22-year-old son, Bishnupada, said: My father was not connected with the CPM in any way. How could they call him a corrupt CPM leader?        
	Two days ago, some strangers visited Baren at home, Bishnupada said. They left after an argument. My father said they had claimed to be Maoists and demanded Rs 50,000. He didnt believe they were Maoists because we had not seen them in our village before. But obviously they were, for they carried out the threat to kill him if he didnt pay up.        
	Sal leaf trader Gurucharans wife, Sulekha, said her husband was never a CPM leader. He used to be a small-time worker, she said. They needed an excuse to kill him.        
	Manoj Verma, the West Midnapore police superintendent, also said the two seemed to have been killed for refusing to pay up. The Maoists source of funds has dried up, he said.         
	Earlier, the Peoples Committee Against Police Atrocities used to collect money from villagers, probably for the rebels. But with the area now crawling with security personnel, the source of funds is gone.         
	They need money and are targeting villages where cops are not present, Verma said.         
	Around 8.30pm yesterday, about 50 Maoists along with about 300 people from nearby villages landed in Sirish hunting for CPM leaders and workers. They herded 15 of them into the CPM office, among them were Baren and Gurucharan.         
	The Maoists held a kangaroo court that ordered Baren and Gurucharan be put to death. The two were taken to a forest and shot dead. The two other men who were also taken to the forest were let off after being made to sign on anti-CPM posters.        
	CPM house burnt        
	About 15 Maoists torched the house of a CPM leader in Salboni tonight. Police said when the Maoists did not find Sudarshan Das in his house, they set it on fire.

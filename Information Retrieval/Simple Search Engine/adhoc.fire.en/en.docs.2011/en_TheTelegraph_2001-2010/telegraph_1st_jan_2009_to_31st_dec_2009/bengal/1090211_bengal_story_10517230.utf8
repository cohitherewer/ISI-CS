The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Sop for Haldia landlosers
                                                                                                               Sop for Haldia landlosers
                            
	Haldia, Feb. 10: The Haldia Development Authority today promised to fund the higher education of the sons and daughters of landlosers if they studied in an engineering college or polytechnic in the port town.        
	Chairman Lakshman Seth said the authority would bear 75 per cent of the course fees for general-category students and 85 per cent for those from the backward castes and classes. Over the past two decades, the authority has acquired around 15,000 acres from 10,000 people.        
	The Trinamul Congress called the sop an election stunt.

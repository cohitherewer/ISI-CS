                                                   Shower boon for gardens in Dooars
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Alipurduar, Oct. 8: The incessant rain that has been lashing the Dooars for the past two days may be a cause of concern for the tour operators in the region but it has made the managements of tea gardens very happy.         
	The rain will help extend the period of plucking the season-end crop by at least a month.         
	S.K. Pathak, the chief advisory officer of Tea Research Academy in Nagrakata, said: A long and dry spell had prevailed over the Dooars for few months. But the rainfall in the past 36 hours will be beneficial for the tea bushes. The area has received 10 to 12 inches of rainfall, which is rare during this time of the year. The rain will increase the moisture in the soil.        
	Amitangshu Chakroborty, the secretary of the Indian Tea Planters Association (ITPA) of Birpara, said: Rainfall during this time of the year will be good for the bushes. This year, the plucking of the season-end crop will be extended till December instead of ending in November. This means that the gardens will be able to pluck the leaves for at least an extra month. The tea market is very good now and the rain will also improve the quality of the produce.         
	Chakroborty said a balance of moisture, humidity and temperature is essential for good quality produce on time.         
	Last year after pruning, the first flush was delayed as the bushes took a lot of time to grow. However, the leaves are expected to sprout early this year, as the soil is likely to retain moisture after receiving more than adequate rainfall, he said.        
	Chakroborty added that on many tea estates, the irrigation begins in November. But because of heavy rain this year, irrigation will be required only at a much later stage.         
	Chamurchi Tea Estate has received 14 inches of rainfall in the past 36 hours. During the dry spell last month, the bushes were attacked by insects. The shower at this time will minimise the damage caused by pests to a large extent, Chakroborty said.

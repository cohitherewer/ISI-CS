	Lalgarh, April 30: They came in droves last night, criss-crossing their way through Lalgarhs villages on their motorcycles.         
	The message that they carried was the same: boycott the polls.        
	Before sunrise today, their job done, they disappeared into the jungles towards Belpahari.        
	But the effect of the nightlong campaign was in evidence this morning at the four polling centres in Lalgarh, Ramgarh and Bhimpur.        
	The buses kept stationed at Barapelia, Kantapahari, Ramgarh and Khasjungle to pick up voters and ferry them to the polling booths stayed the way they had arrived: empty.        
	By the end of the day, the voting percentage at the 40 booths clustered in the four centres  to end the impasse over polling because of the tribal resistance to the police in the region  stood at a miserable 13 per cent.         
	Last night, the dadas came and told us not to vote, said Sudharani Tokal, 30, at Kantapahari. They told us our aandolan (movement) was still on and therefore we should not cast our vote. We listened to them, though they are not from here. They said that if we knew what was good for us we wouldnt cast our vote.        
	This is a message that has convinced even villagers who had wanted to vote.        
	I had wanted vote because I wanted to defeat the CPM for not doing anything for us through all these years, said Lakshmipada Soren of Dorijoria village. But the dadas on motorcycles convinced us not to vote, telling us not to let the cause down.        
	So who are these dadas who convinced the tribals not to cast their votes?        
	The answer was provided this evening via a note circulated by Kishanji, the head of the Maoist action squads eastern India operations. For long, we have been trying to make Lalgarh a free zone for us, the note said. We have finally managed to do so. We have been successful with our booth boycott call in Lalgarh.        
	West Midnapore superintendent of police Manoj Verma said he had reports that Maoists had been active in the area through last night.        
	It is the Maoists who descended on these villages, who unleashed their fear campaign to prevent the villagers from casting their votes, Verma said. We have also received intelligence inputs to this effect.        
	Maoists or no Maoists, some people in Lalgarh had decided not to vote as early as last November, when the police randomly picked up villagers of Lalgarh following a landmine blast on the chief ministers route.        
	Mastermoshai Asim Ganguly and his wife Uma are among them.        
	The headmaster of Kantapahari Vivekananda High School, Ganguly was shocked when two of his students were arrested after the blast.        
	What kind of cruelty was that? Those students were absolutely innocent, Ganguly said today. We are with the people here, we have been with them for the past 20 years. How can we desert them now? This is the first time in my life that I shall not be casting my vote. If the people of Lalgarh are not voting today, there is every reason for them to do that.        
	Although most of Lalgarh did not vote, the tribal leaders of the Peoples Committee Against Police Atrocities went ahead and did so. Leading the group were Chhatradhar Mahato and his wife.        
	If the people of Lalgarh dont vote, it is not possible for me to force them to come to the polling booths, said Mahato. Its because they feel injustice has been done to them.        
	The district administra- tion laughed this off as a fig leaf. Mahato and his group are with the Maoists, an official said. If they think that by voting they will convince us that they have nothing to do with the guerrillas, they are mistaken.

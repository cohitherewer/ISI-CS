The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Troop promise after terror slur
                                                                                                               Troop promise after terror slur
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Calcutta, April 28: Bengal was today promised the heaviest deployment of central forces among all states after both the CPM and the Trinamul Congress voiced fears of unfair elections.        
	Bengal will get 220 companies (22,000 personnel for all three phases), the highest allotted for any state, election commissioner V.S. Sampat said here today.         
	Sampats assurance came after he and deputy election commissioner R. Balakrishnan met political parties and state officials to review security arrangements ahead of the first phase of voting in the state on Thursday.        
	Congress and Trinamul leaders complained about CPM terror in parts of West Midnapore, Hooghly, Bankura and Purulia. The CPM representatives alleged that their supporters were not being allowed to move freely in parts of East Midnapore, where the local bodies are under Trinamul control. Similar complaints were made about the Darjeeling hills, where the Gorkha Janmukti Morchas writ runs.         
	Initially, our vulnerability mapping called for 10-12 companies for each seat in West Midnapore, Purulia and Bankura and Darjeeling. We will now deploy 14 to 16, a poll panel official said.         
	Trinamul MP Mukul Roy alleged that many areas had remained inaccessible since 2001 because of the CPMs terror. Lalgarh, where Maoists are guiding a tribal resistance to police, also came up.         
	CPM state secretariat member Madan Ghosh said the panel should ensure a high turnout in Lalgarh.

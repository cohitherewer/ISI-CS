          OUR CORRESPONDENT                          A gutted cowshed at Kanaipur. Telegraph picture                                  
	Bolpur, March 7: An on and off fire, which breaks out in the air and dies after water is sprinkled only to reappear in some other part of the house, has petrified residents of Kanaipur village in Birbhum.        
	It has so far hit at least 55 houses, burning beds, blankets and clothes.         
	Fire brigade officials who visited the village suspect methane gas from drying ponds and wells can be the reason. We suspect the small fires are being caused by methane. In rural areas, methane gas often forms in dry and unused ponds and wells and bursts into flames when it comes in contact with oxygen. Methane forms in the mud, amid rotten leaves and vegetation that collect on the beds of drying ponds and wells, said Dilip Das, the officer in charge of the local Rampurhat fire station.         
	The muddy water has to be drained out and the leaves cleared to solve the problem.         
	Das said two ponds where the water level had reached almost the bottom had been identified at Kanaipur, about 280km from Calcutta, and villagers engaged to clean them up. Well clean them and see whether the fires stop. If they dont, we will have to talk to experts, said Das.        
	Following district magistrate Bishweswar Maitys orders, two fire engines have been stationed in the village.         
	Many villagers blame evil spirits for the fires. Abdul Rahim, 46, a Congress panchayat member, was stupefied when he found a blanket, in a corner of his hut, in flames. It started all of a sudden. My daughter Salma poured a bucket of water on the blanket and the fire was gone, said Abdul.        
	Many villagers are spending sleepless nights. We are scared to sleep at night because we live in thatched houses. If our hut catches fire when we are asleep, we may be burnt to death, said Shorab Ali, 37.         
	In my house, fire broke out several times, burning clothes, gunny bags and some mattresses, he added.

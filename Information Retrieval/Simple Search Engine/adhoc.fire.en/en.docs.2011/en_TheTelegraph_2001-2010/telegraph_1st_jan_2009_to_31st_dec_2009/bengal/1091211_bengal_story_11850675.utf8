	Calcutta: The CPM reacted to the railways letter with caution, avoiding the vexed issues of returning 400 acres and paying compensation to Tata Motors to get the plot back.         
	We had said wed initiate talks with the land-holder (the Tatas) if the railways show interest in our proposal. Since the railways have agreed, we can always talks to the Tatas, industries minister Nirupam Sen said at the end of the weekly CPM state secretariat meeting. Asked about the 400 acres, he added: We cant comment before speaking to the rail board and the Tatas.         
	CPM leaders said the government and the party would move cautiously in view of the ambiguity and political tenor of the railways letter.

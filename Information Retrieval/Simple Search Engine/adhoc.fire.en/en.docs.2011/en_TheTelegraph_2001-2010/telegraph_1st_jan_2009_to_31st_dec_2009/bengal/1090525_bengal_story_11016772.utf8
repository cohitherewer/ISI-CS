          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Tamluk, May 24: This mornings Haldia Petrochemicals accident left Tapasi Das, 22, a widow five days after her wedding.        
	Gopal Das, 28, who had married her on Tuesday and left to join work three days later, was among the three killed during a clean-up job at the complex.        
	Only five days ago I had gone to Tapasis home in Mahishadal as a barjatri. Today I brought to her the news of her husbands death, said Gopals cousin and neighbour Narayan Das.        
	Narayan had arrived at Gopals house in Bhabanipur village, Haldia, at 8am after receiving the news on his mobile from HPL workers. I didnt want to tell Tapasi, so I tiptoed into the house and informed Gopals father. But as luck would have it, Tapasi was in the next room and heard everything. She ran to us and fell unconscious, said Narayan, a farm labourer.        
	Gopal was 58-year-old Gobordhans only son. His three elder sisters are all married and settled in Haldia.        
	Gopal got the job two years ago. We got him married hoping he would have a happy life. But God has snatched happiness from our lives, Gobordhan wept.        
	Neighbours took Tapasi to a nursing home while Gobordhan rushed to the morgue at Haldia Subdivisional Hospital. The body was handed over at 5.30pm after post-mortem.         
	Supervisor Pintu Pradhan, 30, who too died with Gopal, had got married last March. His wife Sonali, 24, took ill after she received the news at their home at Hingli, Haldia.        
	Pintus elder brother Bharat, a contract labourer at Indian Oil, Haldia, broke down at the hospital this afternoon. We dont know how to console Sonali. Our first duty is to help her get over the shock, said Pintus cousin Mahadeb.

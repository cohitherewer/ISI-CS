The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Bandh caution from Mamata
                                                                                                               Bandh caution from Mamata
          A STAFF REPORTER                               
	Calcutta, June 13: Mamata Banerjee asked her party workers in Calcutta to be more disciplined and not arbitrarily call bandhs the same day her supporters began a police boycott in Khejuri.        
	At a closed-door meeting in south Calcutta, the Trinamul Congress chief told her activists to behave like commoners.        
	One should not hold blockades and bandhs arbitrarily. Workers should consult the senior party leadership before deciding on such matters. The party will not be responsible for anyone acting arbitrarily, a source quoted Mamata as saying.         
	Remember, everyone is watching you. Now people will judge you even more closely, the railway minister is believed to have said.        
	In the evening, Mamata visited former chief minister Jyoti Basu at his Salt Lake home to wish the 94-year-old a long life and sound health. Basu reciprocated by congratulating Mamata and her party for the Lok Sabha election success.        
	Jyotibabu congratulated me several times for the election success. I told him aapni bhalo thakun and that I was not here to discuss politics.         
	After the 10-minute meeting with Basu, Mamata visited another former chief minister, Siddhartha Shankar Ray, at his Beltala residence.        
	She said she would meet the governor on Monday and submit a list of those killed in state-sponsored violence after the elections.

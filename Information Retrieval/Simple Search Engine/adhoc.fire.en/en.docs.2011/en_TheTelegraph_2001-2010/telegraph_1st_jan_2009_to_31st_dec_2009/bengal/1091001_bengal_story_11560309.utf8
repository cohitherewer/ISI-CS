The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Weed-out attempt by CPM 
                                                                                                               Weed-out attempt by CPM 
          ANINDYA SENGUPTA                              
	Calcutta, Sept. 30: The Bengal CPM has emphasised the need to initiate action against leaders who are dishonestly raising money by strengthening the hands of contractors and promoters, according to a party document.        
	The state CPM has begun sending the document to all district committees mentioning that it had been drafted in accordance with the decisions taken at the two-day state committee meeting last month.        
	It is being noticed that a section of our party is dishonestly raising funds from contractors and promoters whose hands are being strengthened by them (the party leaders). In some cases, we have come to know that subscriptions are also being forcibly collected using the partys name.        
	Its a must for our party to take action against these leaders or workers who, according to reports, do not have incomes that match their expenditure. If action isnt initiated against these elements by committees to which they are attached, it would be considered an offence, the document said.        
	The warning is being issued at a time the CPMs central leadership is deliberating on the draft rectification paper that awaits finalisation but not before the crucial October 11 politburo meeting in Delhi. Chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee, who has skipped a few politburo meetings, is likely to attend the session.        
	Asked about the Bengal party document, a CPM state secretariat member said: Whats wrong with it? Our party has become big and undesirable elements are likely to creep in. The CPM is different from the rest as it can weed out unruly and dishonest people.        
	 What is needed, according to the state CPM leadership, to tide over the crisis is that leaders should maintain an honest lifestyle and stick to party discipline.        
	The state CPMs rectification drive is being seen as prompted by the series of electoral setbacks. According to the CPM document, the state committee will also have to own responsibility for the ideological drift in the organisation. People who have no idea about a communist partys programme and functioning have joined our party. This vast majority of members need to be taught about party ideals. The line between a communist party and bourgeois parties is becoming thinner. The state committee and district committees of the CPM cannot disown responsibility for that, the paper said.        
	 Everybody knows that a party is run from the top. Therefore, the lifestyle of the leadership should be plain, simple and honest. That will make them accessible to the people. We have to go back to the masses and make them re-establish their confidence in the CPM. Our partys erosion is because of complacency and dishonesty of a section of leaders at different levels. This has to be rectified in order to overcome the crisis we face now, the document said.

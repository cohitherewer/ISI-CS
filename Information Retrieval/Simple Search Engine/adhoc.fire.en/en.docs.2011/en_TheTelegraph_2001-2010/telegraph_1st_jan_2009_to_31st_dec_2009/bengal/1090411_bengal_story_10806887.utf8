The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Lalgarh ball back in govt hands   Law and order up to state, says EC
                                                                                                               Lalgarh ball back in govt hands     -  Law and order up to state, says EC
          OUR BUREAU                            Debashis Sen (top), Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee: Maoist knot                                       
	Calcutta, April 10: The Election Commission has declined to be the shoulder from which the state government hoped to fire and break the Lalgarh deadlock.        
	The commission today said the decision to send police into the blockaded region lay entirely with the state administration, landing the state government in a quandary close to the elections.        
	The government had lobbed the ball into the commissions court, hoping to wash its hands of any unpleasant decision that carried the risk of a repeat of Nandigram.         
	Repeating the play-safe stand, chief secretary Asok Mohan Chakrabarti said even today: If the Election Commission directs us to send the police to Lalgarh and its adjoining areas, we are bound to do that.        
	However, chief electoral officer Debashis Sen said the commissions view that maintenance of law and order is a state subject had been conveyed to the state government. Sen had yesterday met Election Commission officials in Delhi on the issue.        
	The government will now have to decide whether to break the blockade of the Peoples Committee Against Police Atrocities in West Midnapore, which has refused to let the police in, and risk a backlash.         
	Or it can opt to do nothing  something the government has been doing when faced with tricky situations post-Nandigram. In that case, the poll panel will have to decide whether elections in the area, which fall on April 30, can be policed by home guards whom the committee has agreed to let in.        
	The Election Commission is not going to advise the government whether or not to send the police to Lalgarh. Our job is restricted to holding free and fair polls in a peaceful manner, a poll official said.         
	Election Commission sources said the chief secretary had been told that Bengal was not the only state facing the Maoist menace. Over nine states had the same problem and the governments there had been told to tackle the problem on their own. The Election Commission cant bail out any government for the political problems it faces, the poll official said, adding that he was aware of the ground reality.         
	We have already received a special report (compiled from data by the state government as well as central intelligence agencies) and gone through it, the official said.        
	Chief secretary Chakrabarti said the government did not want to do anything that can vitiate the pre-poll atmosphere in Lalgarh and create distrust among the people of the area, even though law and order is a state subject.         
	We havent heard of elections being conducted without police presence. But we will act according to the EC directives. We cannot compromise with the safety and security of the electorate and poll personnel, he added.        
	The CPM leadership said the poll panel could not shed its responsibility to ensure peaceful polls. CPM state secretariat member Benoy Konar said: The law and order machinery... is effectively under the Election Commissions control from the day polls are announced. The poll panel cannot shed its responsibility to ensure peaceful elections in an area that Maoists have turned into their liberated zone.         
	Konar suggested that the election watchdog should think of setting up polling booths for the Lalgarh voters outside the areas that were most tense so that the polls can be held under police protection.         
	Forward Blocs Asoke Ghosh said: It is the commission which has to decide whether or not to send the police.

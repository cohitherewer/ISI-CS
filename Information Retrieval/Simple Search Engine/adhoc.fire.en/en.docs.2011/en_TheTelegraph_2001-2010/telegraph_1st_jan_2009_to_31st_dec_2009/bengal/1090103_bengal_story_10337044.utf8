The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Pill for tribal uplift
                                                                                                               Pill for tribal uplift
                            
	Midnapore, Jan. 2: The government today promised free poultry and cattle, an irrigation project and efforts to turn fallow land cultivable, a day before tribals resume the Lalgarh agitation protesting alleged police atrocities.        
	An all-party meeting was called today to announce the pro-jects, but the Peoples Committee Against Police Atrocities refused to attend. The protesters had given the West Midnapore police chief time till January 2 to go to Dalilpur village in the heart of Lalgarh and apologise for the atrocities.        
	All mainline parties, including the Trinamul Congress, took part in the meeting. District Magistrate N.S. Nigam said: We will spend Rs 3 crore on distribution of poultry and livestock to the backward people, develop irrigation facilities with Rs 20 lakh from the chief ministers fund and spend Rs 6 crore on conversion of fallow land into cultivable land and soil conservation.        
	He added that 1,000 houses were being built for the Lodha community and schools and hostels for the backward regions.        
	Committee leader Chhatradhar Mahato said his outfit skipped the meeting because it was of no use.        
	The administration did not keep any promise, like paying compensation to those injured in police raids after the Salboni blast. The SP also did not apologise, Chhatradhar added.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | CPM divided over action on Mollah   Not illegal for some, immoral for others
                                                                                                               CPM divided over action on Mollah     Not illegal for some, immoral for others
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                      Abdur Rezzak Mollah at the news conference he held on Tuesday to defend himself				                                       
	Calcutta, Sept. 4: The CPM is unhappy with Abdur Rezzak Mollah for leasing out 44 acres of government land to Vedic Village in an out-of-court settlement, but appears split on action against the land and land reforms minister.        
	Why should we take action against Rezzak? He didnt do anything illegal, a veteran leader said after a meeting of the partys powerful state secretariat this morning.        
	According to him, Rezzak said in his report to the party that the plot he leased out had ceased to be farmland and it was vested by the government on the ground of legalities after the Vedic promoters bought it. He said he compelled the promoters to pay for the land twice, first to the landowners and then to the government as lease amount, the veteran said.         
	But another secretariat member sang a different tune. The way Rezzak handled the issue left many a loose end. Prima facie, even if he had not done anything strictly illegal, he cant escape after doing things that people perceive as immoral, he said, referring to Mollahs visits to the resort for free ayurvedic treatment.         
	According to this section, the party will decide on Mollah after state secretary Biman Bose returns from Delhi.         
	The minister has been accused of giving away the land at a throwaway price when there was no legal compulsion to do so. He charged the promoters Rs 3,670 a cottah in 2005, when Vedic had sold the same land at Rs 50,000 a cottah in 2001.        
	We had preliminary discussions on his (Mollahs) report today. But Bimanda will go through the reports of the partys North and South 24-Parganas units on Vedic Village before taking a decision, said another secretariat member.        
	Bose refused to speak on Mollah before leaving for Delhi today.         
	Insiders said the leadersh-ip faced a dilemma over publicly censuring Mollah despite politburo members Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee and Nirupam Sens reservations about the critic of their land acquisition drive for industry. Action against Mollah for the out-of court settlement might bring out many skeletons as some of the promoters are known to be very close to leaders at the highest level, the sources said.        
	Mollah today set up a committee to find out how much land had undergone mutation for the proposed IT township spread across North and South 24-Parganas and how their character had changed.        
	Several reports have come out in the media about land purchase in Rajarhat and Bhangar for the proposed IT township. There are allegations that the land mafia was involved in such transactions and plots were being taken at gunpoint. Keeping all this in mind, I decided to form a committee to look into how much land has been mutated, said Mollah, also the MLA from Bhangar.         
	Similarly, the panel will also try to find out the area of farmland that has been converted for non-agricultural use. I will submit this status report to the cabinet as it had cleared the project.        
	The panel comprising his departments officials has to submit its report in a month.        
	Power plant plot        
	The government today handed over around 350 acres to the West Bengal Power Development Corporation for a proposed plant in Burdwans Katwa, which the Trinamul Congress has been opposing. The 350 acres were taken mostly from willing farmers owing allegiance to the CPM. The 1000MW plant needs over 680 acres more.

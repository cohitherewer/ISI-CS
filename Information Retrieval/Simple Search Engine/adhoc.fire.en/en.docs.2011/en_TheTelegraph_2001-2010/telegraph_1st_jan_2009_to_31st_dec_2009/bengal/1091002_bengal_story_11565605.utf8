The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Way left open for Mahato charge review
                                                                                                               Way left open for Mahato charge review
          A STAFF REPORTER                              
	Calcutta, Oct. 1: Home secretary Ardhendu Sen today said the government would have to first approve the move to charge Chhatradhar Mahato under the Unlawful Activities Prevention Act, keeping the door ajar for allies who had opposed the step.         
	When told that the West Midnapore police had already slapped the stringent act on Chhatradhar, Sen said: They might have found sufficient evidence against him. But when the file comes to the home department and if it is found that the evidences are not enough, then approval may not be given.        
	It seems that the government took a step back on the matter and kept the option of a review open since the chief minister had assured front allies that all decisions on charging anyone under the act would be taken at the highest level of the state administration.         
	After Chhatradhars arrest, the Left allies had asked why the act was slapped on the leader of the Maoist-backed Peoples Committee Against Police Atrocities without consulting them.         
	Chhatradhar was produced in court today and remanded in seven days police custody. He has revealed that the tribal outfit had received funds from a number of Calcutta-based NGOs in the past nine months, police said.         
	Sleuths associated with Chhatradhars interrogation said these are aided by central and state governments and foreign agencies and they have supplied funds to the committees account to strengthen its movement in Lalgarh.        
	We have prepared a list of NGOs and we are yet to know exactly how much money was given to the committee, said an officer of the CID.        
	Police could not produce any document to explain how Chhatradhar paid the premium of a Rs 1 crore insurance policy.        
	Apart from the NGOs, we have come to know that a number of well-known personalities from the fields of art and entertainment provided financial help to the committee to the tune of several lakhs, said the CID officer.        
	The police top brass held a meeting with home secretary Sen this evening to decide what would be the next course of action against the sympathisers. They also informed the chief minister about it.

          A STAFF REPORTER                                        
	Calcutta, June 23: Calcutta will get a combat force trained on the lines of the elite National Security Guard to deal with terrorists.        
	The police brass had proposed the force a few months ago but the state cabinet cleared it today, in the middle of the crackdown in Lalgarh against Maoist guerrillas.         
	This 1,000-strong force will be specifically for the city and equipped to tackle different forms of terrorist attacks, chief minister Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee said.         
	A force comprising three battalions with 2,200 jawans will be formed especially to combat the Maoists across the state, he added.         
	Police insiders said the crack force for Calcutta would be trained in the best of counter-terrorism tactics available in the country. We are getting in touch with the NSG, army and the BSF for guidance in giving shape to the proposal and for their training, said an officer.        
	Additional commissioner Ranjit Pachnanda said: The force would be trained for close-counter combat in built-up areas like malls, highrises and restaurants.         
	The personnel, to be recruited specially for counter-terrorism operations, are likely to carry MP-5 and Kalashnikov rifles besides the made-in-India Insas.        
	The MP-5 is a submachine gun of German design used in close-quarter combat.         
	An officer added that the Kalashnikov (AK series) and Insas rifles would be for long-range attacks.        
	We have already sought 50 acres in Rajarhat for a full-fledged training school. The recruits would be specially trained in fighting in water and preventing attacks from rivers. The training would be tailor-made for the city and intensive, said a senior Calcutta officer.        
	Until the new facility is ready, the training will be given at the Police Training School in Alipore. Home department sources said the first batch would be ready by 2010.        
	According to initial estimates, the commando school could cost around Rs 55 crore. The state government will have to spend around Rs 8 crore a year to run it, said a source in Calcutta police.        
	The city police are set to receive Rs 100 crore  along with Mumbai, Bangalore, Hyderabad, Ahmedabad and Chennai  as central grant for security upgrade.

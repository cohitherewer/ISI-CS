The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Offensive in a fortnight
                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      Offensive in a fortnight
  - Indications that Maoist hunt will begin before Jharkhand polls end        NISHIT DHOLABHAI                                    
	New Delhi, Nov. 25: The offensive against Maoists across three states, starting with Chhattisgarh, is likely to begin around December 10, sources have told The Telegraph.        
	Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand and Maharashtra will be directly involved in the operation, but four other Maoist-hit states, including Bengal, will work in close co-ordination with the Centre.         
	The main job for Bengal, Orissa, Andhra Pradesh and Bihar will be to ensure that the rebels on the run do not get safe havens in their territory.        
	We had maintained that we wouldnt go ahead with the operations unless the police and paramilitary were trained well. We will be in a position to go ahead around December 10, a Chhattisgarh police officer said.         
	Hundreds of CRPF and state police personnel were trained in Chhattisgarh on the sidelines of Operation Greenhunt, aimed at neutralising the Maoists green-hooded camps.         
	More than 40 battalions  each comprising around 1,000 personnel  of paramilitary forces aided by air force choppers will be part of the operations across central India, the sources said.         
	The CRPFs elite commando wing, Cobra, will be used for surgical strikes.         
	The crackdown kick-off coincides with the last leg of the Jharkhand polls.         
	The five-phase elections end on December 18 and the results will be out on December 23.        
	The logistical advantage of holding the operations around election time is the large presence of forces. Some of them may also be re-deployed in the neighbouring states, the sources said.         
	Jharkhands assault will immediately follow Chhattisgarhs. Maharashtra will follow, said a source.         
	A task force under cabinet secretary K.M. Chandrasekhar will monitor security and development of the crackdown zones.        
	The main theatres of the offensive will be the Bastar region in Chhattisgarh and parts of Jharkhand. In Maharashtra, the operation will be in Gadchiroli.        
	However, sources also indicated that back-channel talks with some Naxalite groups were on and the course of action could alter if they succeeded.         
	The talks may also allow the security forces to drive a wedge between the various Maoist groups.         
	Over 160 civilians have been killed by Maoists in Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand and Maharashtra in the past six months, according to the Union home ministry.         
	In the three Maoist-hit districts of Bengal, the toll since May stands at 80.

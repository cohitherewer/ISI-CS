The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Poll personnel
                                                                                                               Poll personnel
                            
	Calcutta, March 16: Bengal is short of 20,000 polling personnel after a 12,000 jump in the number of booths.        
	After a meeting at Writers Buildings, chief electoral officer Debashis Sen said: We analysed the strength of all departments and found a shortfall of 20,000 poll personnel.         
	There are two ways to make up for it  use the same personnel for more than one phase or, in the worst case, engage retired officials and women.         
	In 2006, there were about 48,000 booths. This time, there are 60,000, said Sen. Every booth needs a presiding officer and three polling officers.

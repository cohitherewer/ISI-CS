                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      Officials in town
                            
	Calcutta, Nov. 30: A three-member team led by a Union home ministry official in charge of its Naxalite management division reached Calcutta tonight.        
	They will meet the state chief secretary and home secretary at Writers Buildings tomorrow before finalising their trip to some of the states violence-racked pockets.        
	The Centre wants to discuss the law-and-order situation with the state government, the chief secretary said. Lets see what sort of suggestions they make. We will welcome their recommendations to the extent their implementation is feasible.        
	Union home ministry additional secretary Dipranjan Sarathi Chowdhury, director Neeraj Kanshal and joint director N.K. Misra are likely to go to Arambagh and Khanakul in Hooghly  where Trinamul Congress supporters have been under attack from alleged CPM cadres. Although Chowdhury is heading the team, the state government virtually ruled out possibility of the trio visiting Maoist-hit Lalgarh, saying there were some areas where even the police were sent with extreme caution.        
	The state chief secretary said the Centres letter did not mention anything specific about what they want to discuss. He also does not know the teams travel plans during the two-day trip.

                                                                                                                     4                                                                                      CM seeks Cong help in House
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Calcutta, Dec. 21: Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee today appealed to the Congress to help the government combat Maoists at a time the principal Opposition party, the Trinamul Congress, has joined hands with the guerrillas.        
	I appeal to the Opposition he said after Trinamul members had walked out pro-testing the Speakers refusal to adjourn the House and the Congress was the only Opposition party around. Help us firmly tackle the Maoists when the principal Opposition party, Trinamul, has joined hands with such a hinsra shakti (violent force) in West Midnapore, Bankura and Purulia.         
	He was replying to a debate on a motion  atrocities of divisive forces in the state  tabled by the Congresss Manas Bhuniya.         
	Congress MLAs, however, found the appeal politically motivated. Buddhababu wants to divide the Opposition, said Krishnendu Chowdhury, the Englishbazar MLA.         
	The chief minister admitted that the law-and-order situation had worsened. He told the House 1,794 murders had taken place this year. In all of 2008, the figure was 1,599. The law-and-order situation is not anandadayak (a cause of happiness). But compared to Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh and a small state like Delhi, we are slightly better, he told Bhuniya, who held him responsible for the rise in violence.         
	An official said the Centre had supplied the numbers to the state, but comparative figures were not available.

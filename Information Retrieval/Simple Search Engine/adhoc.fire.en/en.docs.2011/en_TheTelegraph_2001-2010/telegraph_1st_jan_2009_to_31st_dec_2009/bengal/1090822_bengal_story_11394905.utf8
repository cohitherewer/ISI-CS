The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Trinamul soars in city, riding wave
                                                                                                               Trinamul soars in city, riding wave
          OUR BUREAU                              
	Calcutta, Aug. 21: The Trinamul Congress today won the Bowbazar and Sealdah Assembly seats with higher margins, riding what supporters said was Mamata Banerjees soaring urban popularity and the alliance with the Congress.        
	MP Somen Mitras wife Shikha won Sealdah by 16,000 votes and transport union leader Swarnakamal Saha took Bowbazar by over 21,000.        
	In 2006, the Congress had won both seats, but its MLAs turned out for Mamata Banerjees party in this years Lok Sabha elections and won, necessitating the bypolls.        
	In 2006, Mitras margin in Sealdah was 13,000 and Sudip Bandopadhyays around 6,000 in Bowbazar.         
	Observers said the increase in margins was significant because it came on the back of low polling. Only 37 per cent of the votes were cast in Bowbazar and 47 per cent in Sealdah. The turnout at both places was over 54 per cent five years ago.         
	The results should again ring the alarm for the Left, the observers felt. The Left-backed Independent in Bowbazar forfeited her deposit, getting only 14 per cent of the votes. The Left tally was 28 per cent in 2006.        
	This is the first time since 1977 that a Left or Left-backed candidate has had to forfeit deposit other than in Darjeeling, said CPM Calcutta district secretariat member Rabin Deb. Its a shame. We had tried an experiment by putting up a Christian woman (Minati Gomes) as an Independent supported by us in view of the communitys presence in the area. It failed, he added.        
	However, state CPM secretary and Left Front chief Biman Bose tried to make light of the defeat saying that the seats were traditionally Opposition strongholds. Our party had no major presence in either of the constituencies. We also didnt have a major campaign.        
	At least apparently, the Sealdah drubbing was less severe. The CPI candidate got 24 per cent of the votes polled, 2 per cent less than in 2006.        
	Both the seats will cease to exist in the 2011 Assembly po- lls because of delimitation. Sealdah and Bowbazar will become part of Chowringhee.        
	In the Lok Sabha polls this year, Sealdah and Bowbazar were counted as parts of Chowringhee, and Trinamuls Sudip got a lead of 30,000 from the Assembly segment. In the bypolls, the combined victory margin of Sealdah and Bowbazar is over 37,000.         
	Trinamul attributed the victory to Mamata Banerjees increasing popularity among urban voters. Before the Lok Sabha polls, the CPM had said Mamata was losing ground among the urban electorate, and had portrayed her as anti-industry. Voters proved them wrong. This time, they have again showed their preference, said Trinamul Assembly leader Partha Chatterjee. A Mamata wave is sweeping the state.        
	The Congress had wanted to contest at least one of the two seats, but Mamata refused to concede ground to her ally in the city.        
	Shikha and Swarnakamal credited Mamata for their victories. She has shown people how to care for each other, said Swarnakamal.         
	CPM leaders said the byelection to Belgachhia East, which fell vacant with transport minister Subhas Chakrabortys death, will be their prestige fight.         
	Chakraborty had won by only 1,749 votes in 2006 but the CPM leaders are hopeful given the huge turnout at his funeral. Chakrabortys widow Ramala is their likely nominee.

The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Police, party blamed for murder of Maoist
                                                                                                               Police, party blamed for murder of Maoist
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                                            
	Midnapore, Jan 25: An alleged Maoist action squad member was shot dead this morning while he was sipping tea at a stall in Bengals Belpahari.        
	According to police, Nirmal Sardar, 35, was wanted in connection with several cases. According to the Peoples Committee Against Police Atrocities, he was its leader and a victim of a plot by the police, the CPM and a rival outfit.        
	Committee leader Chhatradhar Mahato, said: Nirmal was our leader in Belpahari. The police and the administration are behind his murder. Miscreants backed by the CPM and the Bharat Jakat Majhi Marwa killed him. They have been opposing our agitation against police atrocities.         
	West Midnapore superintendent of police Rajesh Kumar Singh said Nirmal could be a leader of the committee and a Maoist at the same time. We dont know whether Nirmal was a member of the Peoples Committee Against Police Atrocities, but there is a possibility as the committee is backed by Maoists.         
	The officer could not, however, mention any specific case against Nirmal, otherwise a small farmer.         
	An officer said raids had been conducted to nab him, but he was absconding.        
	Nirmal came to the tea stall, about a kilometre from his house at Talpukuria village, around 7.30am. He was having tea when 10 masked men armed with single and double barrel guns arrived on motorcycles. Some of them walked up to Nirmal and shot him several times. He was killed on the spot, a police officer said.         
	The committee had dug up roads and laid siege to neighbouring Lalgarh for almost a month following police raids to capture suspected Maoists in the wake of a landmine blast targeting the chief minister last November.        
	Initially, the tribal body Majhi Marwa was also part of the agitation, but it withdrew midway after talks with the administration. The distance between the two outfits has been growing since.         
	The Marwa protested the committees blockades and held rallies against Maoist activities in the area. Its leaders urged villagers not to shelter the rebels, who, they said, were misleading them.        
	Allegedly instigated by the Maoists, the committee continued with its agitation till December 7, when the police accepted most of its demands, like putting night raids on hold and probing the role of officers accused of torture.         
	On December 11, Marwa leader Sudhir Mandi, who had been organising anti-Maoist rallies, was shot dead by the guerrillas.        
	According to the villagers of Belpahari, about 240km from Calcutta, tension had been building up in the area since the murder. It mounted yesterday after masked men put up posters in Belpahari bazaar saying: Maoists behind the Peoples Committee Against Police Atrocities, beware.        
	Ajit Mahato, 35, a local resident, said around 25 youths had come on motorcycles to paste the posters. Nirmals murder could be to avenge the death of Sudhir Mandi.        
	The committee has called a bandh in West Midnapore, Bankura and Purulia on Tuesday. It held a public meeting in Belpahari this evening. Just like we have stopped co-operating with the police, we will not co-operate with the administration, not even for development schemes, Chhatradhar said.        
	He alleged that a committee supporter had been kidnapped from a village 7km from where Nirmal was killed.

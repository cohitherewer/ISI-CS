The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Congress turns guns on Mamata
                                                                                                               Congress turns guns on Mamata
          OUR SPECIAL CORRESPONDENT                              
	Calcutta, Oct. 3: The state Congress today criticised Mamata Banerjee for her non-cooperation, citing it as the main reason for taking the Lefts support to form the Siliguri civic board.        
	State Congress working president Pradip Bhattacharya said the civic board was formed with Left backing under compulsion. Trinamul is our ally. Had our councillors got a little bit of co-operation from Mamata, there would have been no need to make overtures to the Left, he said.        
	Bhattacharya said the party had asked for reports from the district presidents of Darjeeling and Jalpaiguri about the circumstances under which the councillors had sought the Left Fronts support. We do not approve of the Lefts support for the formation of any civic board. But the situation has to be judged in the light of ground realities. That is why we have sought reports from two district chiefs, he said.         
	Some other leaders were more vocal in criticising Mamata. Subrata Mukherjee, another state Congress working president, said the councillors move should be a reminder to Mamata that her writ will not run across Bengal.         
	Mamata is not even on talking terms with state leaders. She started ignoring us from the day the alliance was firmed up. Now it is established that we shall not go by her diktat all the time, he said after a party meeting in Calcutta.        
	Mukherjee said Mamatas intransigence had ruptured the alliance in Siliguri. She should not have insisted on the mayors post and instead parted with it for the sake of the alliance, he said.        
	Adhir Chowdhury, the Congress MP from Behrampore, said: There was an identity crisis among party workers because of Mamatas domination. The Siliguri councillors bold move to form a civic board is encouraging.         
	Chowdhury said it was improper of Mamata to malign the Congress. She has dubbed the formation of the civic board by the Congress councillors a betrayal of the people of Siliguri. This is a bid to malign the Congress.         
	Siliguri mayor Gangotri Dutta will write to Trinamul district president Gautam Deb on Monday with an appeal to join the board, Darjeeling district Congress president Shankar Malakar said in Siliguri.        
	Mamata will hold a rally in Siliguri tomorrow.

	Bolpur, Feb. 25: Communist Subhas Chakraborty today said there was no bigger devotee of Tara  another name for goddess Kali  than him.        
	Laying the foundation stone of a bus terminus in Birbhums Tarapith this afternoon, transport minister Chakraborty said he was not going to the Kali temple, a stones throw away, as he was there to attend a government programme.         
	I cant go to the temple today, but there is none who is a greater devotee, the CPM leader said.        
	Chakraborty had kicked up a storm performing a puja at the Tarapith temple in September 2006. He chanted jai Tara (victory to goddess Tara) and offered Rs 501, two red hibiscus flowers and a sari to the deity then.        
	Today, Chakraborty went on to give his take on how people started worshipping Tara. In China, there was once an emperor who had a wife called Tara. At that time, the feet of women in China were fettered. Tara told the emperor she would leave him if he did not free the women. The emperor freed the women and people started worshipping Tara, Chakraborty said.        
	Tarapith priests said they had never heard such a story before. That the worship of Tara started in China is new to us, said Jayanta Panda, who heads the priests association.        
	Vote puja being the flavour of the season, the minister laid the foundation stone for a Rs 2-crore bus terminus for which land is yet to be arranged. Birbhum district officials said they knew the terminus would cover an acre, but the minister today announced 11 acres were required for the project. We need to acquire about 10 acres for the terminus, said Chakraborty.        
	Rampurhat subdivisional officer Amitava Sengupta said: The plan was to build the terminus on two-and-a-half bighas (about an acre) but the minister today announced a much bigger project.        
	The CPM has no official ban on religious practices but expects members to steer clear of them.

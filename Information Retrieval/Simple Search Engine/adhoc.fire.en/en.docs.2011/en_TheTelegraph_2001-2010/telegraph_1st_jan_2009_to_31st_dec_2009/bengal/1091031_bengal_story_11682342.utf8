The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | Brother murder blame on CPM
                                                                                                               Brother murder blame on CPM
          OUR CORRESPONDENT                              
	Midnapore, Oct. 30: Trinamul Congress leaders Partha Chatterjee and Sisir Adhikari went to Belpahari today and said the CPM had killed two of their party workers yesterday.        
	Jaladbabu had raised his voice against the CPMs corruption. That is why he was murdered. We will avenge the murder by voting the CPM out of power in 2011, Chatterjee, the leader of the Opposition in the Assembly, declared.        
	Police said Maoists had in all likelihood killed Jaladbaran Kar and his brother Ashis after they refused to pay extortion money. There were charges of corruption against the two, one a contractor and the other a ration dealer.        
	We are probing all angles, but it appears to be a Maoist handiwork, said West Midnapore police chief Manoj Verma.        
	Chatterjee later told reporters in Jhargram town that the double murder had been carried out jointly by the CPM and the police. Why did the police not call in sniffer dogs for the probe?        
	Villagers tonight started squatting outside Belpahari police station with the bodies protesting the absence of sniffer dogs.        
	Chatterjee said: We will ask our leader Mamata Banerjee to ensure a high-level inquiry.        
	Adhikari said: The more the CPM is being cornered politically, the more they are attacking our workers and passing the blame on to the Maoists.        
	At Bamundiha village, the slain Jaladbarans wife Anusree said a man came to their house around 5.15pm yesterday and asked her husband if he recognised him. He said he had come to our house before and had tea. He wanted to meet Ashis. My husband took the man to Ashiss house next door. The three of them walked towards a well in our compound where three men were standing. Then suddenly we heard gunshots.

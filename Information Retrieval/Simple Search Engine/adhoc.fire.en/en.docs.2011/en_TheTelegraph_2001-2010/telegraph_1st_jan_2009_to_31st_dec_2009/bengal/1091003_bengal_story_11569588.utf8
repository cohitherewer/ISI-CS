                                                                                                               Trinamul sniffs higher Cong conspiracy     Forgive us, Partha tells Siliguri
          OUR BUREAU                           Partha Chatterjee (centre) in Siliguri on Friday                                        
	Siliguri/New Delhi, Oct. 2: Trinamul leader Partha Chatterjee today accused the Congress of operating not at the local but at the state and national levels to bring down his party in Siliguri.         
	The Opposition leader in the Assembly took out a procession in town to seek forgiveness from the citizens of Siliguri and condemn the Congress and the CPM.         
	The Congress and Trinamul command equal number of seats in the Siliguri Municipal Corporation. When neither ally budged from its demand for the mayors post, an election for the chair became inevitable. Yesterday, all the 17 councillors of the Left Front voted in favour of the Congresss mayoral candidate, Gangotri Dutta.        
	It was a deep-rooted conspiracy hatched at the state and central levels with the only motive to stop Mamata Banerjee and to keep the CPM alive, Chatterjee said at Baghajatin Park from where the protest march began this evening. We condemn the conspiracy and seek forgiveness from the residents of Siliguri as we could not live up to their expectations.        
	On Sunday, Trinamul chief Mamata Banerjee will address a meeting at the same park.        
	Mamata, who is in Delhi, has refused to meet top leaders of the Congress.         
	She is learnt to have indicated to her close aides that she does not want to meet Congress president Sonia Gandhi as that would be tantamount to sacrificing her self-respect.         
	Trinamul sources said Mamata felt Sonia could not have been ignorant of the Congress step to seek CPM help in Siliguri.         
	She feels personally betrayed by Sonia, a close Mamata aide said.        
	In Siliguri, Chatterjee spoke of a well-hatched plan by some parties who want to cling to power. People here had voted out the Left and brought the alliance to power. All this happened because of a well-hatched plan of some parties that were desperate to cling to power, ignoring the peoples mandate, he said.         
	CPM leaders in Siliguri, who too are facing questions from their partners, today spoke of continuing to mount pressure on anti-Left forces.        
	We protest yesterdays incident of ransacking by Trinamul supporters and want the guilty to be arrested, said urban development minister Asok Bhattacharya, who is believed to have worked out the deal with the Congress at the local level before extending support.        
	Asked about their pact with the Congress, the CPM leader said his party had acted on the basis of a letter sent by the Darjeeling district Congress president, Shankar Malakar. Whatever we have done is in the interest of Siliguri. We discussed the proposal and decided to vote for the Congress, he said.         
	The Congress, which saw its own supporters go on the rampage with Trinamul activists yesterday, was silent.

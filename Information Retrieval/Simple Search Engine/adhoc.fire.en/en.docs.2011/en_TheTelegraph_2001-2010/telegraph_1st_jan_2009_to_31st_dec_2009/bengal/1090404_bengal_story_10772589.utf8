The Telegraph - Calcutta (Kolkata) | Bengal | 500-car reception for Jaswant in the hills
                                                                                                               500-car reception for Jaswant in the hills
          OUR BUREAU                          Jaswant Singh gifts a shawl to Bimal Gurung in New Delhi on Friday. Telegraph picture                                   
	April 3: A cavalcade of 500 cars, flowers all along the way from the plains and music: the Gorkha Janmukti Morcha to-day promised the biggest reception in Darjeelings history for our candidate Jaswant Singh.        
	The BJP announced the candidature of its Rajya Sa- bha leader from the Darjeeling Lok Sabha seat after the Morcha promised to throw its weight behind one of its heavyweight leaders.        
	Jaswant will arrive in Darjeeling on Tuesday. He will file his nomination on April 9, the last day to do so for the April 30 elections.        
	It will be a grand wel- come, the biggest reception in Darjeelings history, Morcha president Bimal Gurung told The Telegraph from Delhi.        
	Tipped off by the party chief about the impending announcement, Morcha leaders in the hills started preparations for the grand welcome early this morning. Our supporters will go down to receive Jaswant Singh in at least 500 cars. Many more will line the route with flowers to greet him, said publicity secretary Binay Tamang. We are calling up our prominent supporters and asking them to pitch in.        
	Morcha general secretary Roshan Giri said Jaswant would stay in Darjeeling till the elections were over. We had requested (L.K.) Advani to contest from the seat and, if not possible, to field any BJP heavyweight We are expecting Advani to come to Darjeeling to campaign, he added.        
	The Morcha had wanted its demand for a separate Gorkhaland in the BJP election manifesto, but the document released today says: We will sympathetically examine and appropriately consider the long-pending demands of the Gorkhas, Adivasis and other people of Darjeeling district and (the) Dooars region.        
	The climbdown follows the Morchas failed talks with the Congress, reluctant to be seen as sympathetic to the statehood demand, and realisation that it will not be able to achieve Gorkhaland on its own. It is better to have a national party espousing our cause than have one seat of our own in Parliament, a Morcha leader said.         
	Gurung said Morcha leaders would campaign for the BJP in other states where the Gorkhas have a presence. We can influence the outcome in at least 10 seats, he claimed.        
	The outfits confidence in Darjeeling rests on the fact that though the hills and the plains share almost the same number of votes, the hill people have been voting as one since the rise of Subash Ghisingh in the 1980s. In Siliguri and the Dooars, both the CPM and the Congress have a presence, splitting the votes in the plains.         
	The states CPM and Congress leaderships today slammed the BJP decision to support the Gorkha cause and field a candidate from Darjeeling. Left Front chairman Biman Bose said: We wont allow a division of Bengal and will campaign against it across the state.        
	In Calcutta, state BJP lea-ders tried to clarify that they were also not supporting the demand for Gorkhaland.         
	Urban affairs minister and the CPMs main man in north Bengal, Asok Bhattacharya, said the Bengal government was ready to offer extreme autonomy to the Morcha in hill affairs but not statehood.         
	The BJPs support, he added, would complicate the ongoing tripartite talks.         
	Jibe at law        
	Jaswant, who has been served a notice by the Election Commission for allegedly distributing money during campaign, apparently told a TV channel that the law is an ass.        
	Im sorry, I did no wrong. The law is an ass...and... if the law runs contrary or counter to traditional requirements or conduct, then I think the law must be examined, PTI quoted him as telling NDTV.

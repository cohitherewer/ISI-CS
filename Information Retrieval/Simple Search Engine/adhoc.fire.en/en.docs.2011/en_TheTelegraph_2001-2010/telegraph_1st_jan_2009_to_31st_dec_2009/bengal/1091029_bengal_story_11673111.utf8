          RITH BASU                          Ray in Calcutta. (Pradip Sanyal)                                  
	Calcutta, Oct. 28: Santini-ketan cant decide whether the Maharshi has messaged yet but the Mahatmas grandson did hear from Rajat Kanta Ray today.        
	The Visva-Bharati vice-chancellor left his seat of meditation under a tree at Santiniketan and met governor Gopalkrishna Gandhi in Calcutta this evening.         
	Various charges have been brought against him by the universitys striking teachers and employees  from diverting student welfare funds and selling copies of unpublished Rabindranath Tagore paintings at Rs 9,000 to running up Rs 10 lakh in personal medical expenses.        
	After his meeting with Gandhi, Ray said he gave the universitys rector his take on the impasse and the charges. I took the initiative to meet the governor and gave him my report on the charges. I also told him Im open to a probe.        
	A day after the university employees started their strike, Ray had planted himself at Chhatimtala to seek instructions from Maharshi (Debendranath Tagore, 1817-1905).         
	Santiniketan is still split on whether Ray did a planchette or sent a mail to Rabindranaths father. He made our day on Saturday. We kept watching him reclining on the grass as if it were his couch. He was shifting with the shade every now and then, said a first-year student, almost choking with laughter.        
	The speculation soon turned to which tech tool Maharshi had used for the communion. Come on, how could it be an SMS. My phone always loses the tower near Chhatimtala, quipped one.        
	The wags have spread beyond the campus. When a regular asked the boy at Kalor Dokan why he took so long with the tea, he said: Kabigurur instructioner opekkha korchhilam (I was waiting for Kabigurus instructions).        
	Rays call for divine intervention has given Santiniketan, where time moves reluctantly, scope to laugh at its own lethargy. He is perhaps one of the best professors of history in Bengal and the nephew of Amartya Sen. But Santiniketan seems to have made him ashanta (agitated), said a friend of the scholar.         
	His relatives and friends have been telling him to put in his papers but, true to his recent trait, Ray waits for the sanction from his inner self.        
	He can do nothing simple these days. Ask him to place flowers before the portraits of Kabiguru or Gandhiji and he will lie prostrate in front of them. He will break into a song during addresses and refer to his Nobel laureate uncle as Bablu Kaka, said a teacher.        
	In January 2008, the VC sat the whole day alone at Chhatimtala to bring peace to Santiniketan after a student was shot dead in the hostel.
